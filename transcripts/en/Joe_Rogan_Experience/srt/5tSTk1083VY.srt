1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,130
Five,
four,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,900
three,
two,

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,830
one.
Boom.

4
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:09,510
And we're live.
Thanks for doing this man.

5
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:11,010
I appreciate it.
Thank you for having me.

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,170
Appreciate it.
You're the only guy I've ever had in the

7
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:15,360
studio where and when I showed up,
you were working out.

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,610
That's what I do,
man.

9
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:19,200
That's my life.
That's my life.

10
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,520
It's pretty crazy though.
I mean,

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,080
how much time did you have when you got 
here?

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,600
I got here about an hour early.
Oh,

13
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:25,490
okay.
Okay.

14
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,460
I got a little early so I got here.
Shirt off doing chin of.

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,560
He's hilarious.
I didn't get my camera out in time for 

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,541
you saw me.
I wanted to take some pictures or maybe 

17
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,501
next time.
Next time we'll catch you after the 

18
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:37,501
show.
Um,

19
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:41,660
you are a guy that for a lot of people 
you sort of embody the idea of hardening

20
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:47,250
your mind,
right?

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,520
And figuring out a way to do things that
most people think are impossible.

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,830
That's.
You've sort of become that guy over your

23
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,960
life and you become that guy for a lot 
of people,

24
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:01,230
including me online.
We've talked about you on the podcasts a

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,070
ton of times.
Right?

26
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,400
So having you in here has been a very 
exciting to me.

27
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:06,840
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,610
How'd you become that guy?
You know what?

29
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,760
I grew up.
Not that guy.

30
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,580
Yeah.
So a lot of people put a title on me.

31
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,940
They went to a,
they see me now.

32
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,180
They see me now as the guy with his 
shirt off,

33
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,820
we can do 4,030
pull ups and 17 hours.

34
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:28,350
You can run five miles and 39 hours who 
can do all this crazy shit.

35
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,830
But when they don't understand is they 
don't understand the journey that it 

36
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,221
took me to get to this point.
And what got me to this point was I was 

37
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:38,790
just the opposite of what I end the day.

38
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,330
I was that guy who ran away from 
absolutely everything that I got in 

39
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:49,101
front of me,
but not many people knew that I had two 

40
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:52,191
people at the,
at like the real me was like this very 

41
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:56,421
scared,
insecure stuttering got beat up by his 

42
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:59,430
dad and all this kind of stuff.
And I built this fake person that walked

43
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:02,840
around like my shit didn't stink,
you know?

44
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,880
Yeah.
So that was,

45
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,650
that's kind of how I did it and I do a 
process of time.

46
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:10,380
I realized that I was lying to myself 
lying to people.

47
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,890
But it's a fascinating journey though,
because you are that guy now when you 

48
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,540
genuinely are legit bad ass at one point
in time you were legit.

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,380
Terrified person.
Yes.

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,600
So what was the process like?
How did,

51
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,360
how did you step forth?
Well,

52
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,100
it's a,
it's a long process.

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,790
Um,
I,

54
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,300
my dad beat the shit on me and I was 
growing up.

55
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,770
I was the first black betty born in this
hospital called Millard fillmore in 

56
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,540
Buffalo,
New York.

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,300
My Dad don't skating rinks.
He owned bars.

58
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:45,330
He ran prostitutes from Canada to 
Buffalo,

59
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,010
New York.
My Dad was big time pimp,

60
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:49,590
big time.
Anything bad about a person,

61
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,100
big time hustler.
He was American that I moved with them.

62
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,220
Denzel Washington.
He was at but not that bad,

63
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,900
you know,
he wasn't that big,

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,200
but that's what it me of.
He was that kind of guy and beat the 

65
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,990
shit out of me,
you know,

66
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,060
I'll have my mom.
There was an incident one time when my 

67
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,581
mom got knocked out and top of the 
stairs and he drug her down the stairs 

68
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:12,430
by her hair.
It at six years old on their.

69
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:16,090
Forget this in my mind,
I was always afraid.

70
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,150
My whole life I was afraid of.
I had this fucking voice,

71
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,740
this conscience that would always be 
battling me saying,

72
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,370
hey,
you gotta get up and do something.

73
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,460
I didn't want to do shit,
you know,

74
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,140
I was just afraid,
but I would that,

75
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:31,840
that voice would force me to get up.
And my dad,

76
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,870
you know,
I tried to beat him up or whatever at 

77
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,221
six and I get my ass kicked.
So this went on for several years and 

78
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:38,290
have a big time.
Lauren disability can.

79
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,970
My Dad didn't believe in us going to 
school.

80
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,540
So my dad,
it was about the business,

81
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,900
the skating rink and the bar.
So the skating rink opened by 7:00

82
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:49,600
at night and this time I was able to 
walk.

83
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,980
So about five,
you know,

84
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,330
four or five,
six years old,

85
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,020
eight,
nine.

86
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,650
And I go to the skating rink is 7:00
at night.

87
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,850
And I worked the skating rink until 10 
at night and then we will scrape the gum

88
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:05,851
off the floors and we cleaned the whole 
skating rink up and then my dad had an 

89
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:09,360
office in my brother and myself asleep 
in the office and my momma go upstairs 

90
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,190
and work the bar until 3:00
in the morning and then they cleaned the

91
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:12,640
bar up.

92
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,970
So after all that shit was done with 
going to school,

93
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,700
rarely happened.
So when I went to school,

94
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,280
I was all kind of,
you know,

95
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,030
my,
my learning disability,

96
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:27,031
I had social anxiety.
I was just a jacked up kid from living 

97
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:28,930
in this tortured home from the outside 
looking in.

98
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,140
We lived in an all white neighborhood 
and then we would travel to the ghetto 

99
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,690
of buffalo in New York with the skating 
rink.

100
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,220
Was that.
So we,

101
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,310
you know,
we worked around mostly blacks and I 

102
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,161
lived around mostly whites,
but no one knew what was going on in 

103
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:44,320
that house to,
onto a one paradise road.

104
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,150
Yeah,
I mean,

105
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,450
it's crazy.
But,

106
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:51,451
um,
my mom got courage to finally leave him 

107
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:52,450
when I was eight years old.
We moved to a small town in Brazil,

108
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:55,300
Indiana,
and that's when the real war started for

109
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:56,470
me and Brazil.

110
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,300
Indiana is a small town,
great people,

111
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,390
a lot of great people.
And I say that because a lot people get 

112
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,690
offended and I'm going to get to the 
point where they get offended.

113
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,710
There was about maybe 10 black families 
at about 10,000

114
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:13,711
people in town and in 1995,
the KKK march the fourth of July parade.

115
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,290
So this was a.
not everybody was racist.

116
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,330
It was a lot of good people in the best 
people I knew was there,

117
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,830
but there was also a lot of racism 
there.

118
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,850
So me being one of the few black kids 
net in that area,

119
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,780
you know,
it,

120
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,120
it kind of haunts you.
I had stuff in my notebook,

121
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,690
you know,
Nigga,

122
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,820
we're going to kill you on my Spanish 
notebook.

123
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,650
They had that on my car,
Nigga,

124
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:35,510
we're going to kill this early nineties.
And um,

125
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,650
so even though I showed it didn't hurt 
me,

126
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,850
it was jack and me up.

127
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,790
So all the insecurities I have and I was
a kid with my father.

128
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,210
I've moved into this area here and it 
just got worse and worse and worse and 

129
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:53,431
it haunted me and that voice that talked
about it kept talking louder and louder 

130
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:58,531
and louder.
I was doing nothing about it and I 

131
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:02,091
decided to make moves and I cheated all 
through school and it's kind of humbling

132
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:05,440
to top of my stories sometimes.
And this is,

133
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,820
it's also embarrassing,
but um,

134
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:12,821
it's real is who the fuck I am is what I
am as it's created me and copy from the 

135
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:18,491
fourth grade to the,
to my junior year in high school on 

136
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:19,940
every assignment and I want to get in 
the military.

137
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,480
When I joined the Air Force and the guy 
gave me as vap test,

138
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:28,481
it's like a watered down and sat and I 
couldn't copy on it because the guy 

139
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:29,240
beside me had a test a test b.

140
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,630
They got him a right tessie.
So I've looked the copy on this test and

141
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:35,270
I couldn't copy on her.
So I got like a 20 and I wanted to be an

142
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:40,271
air force pararescueman as guys that 
jump out of airplanes and saved down 

143
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:40,271
pilots.
It's a,

144
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:44,910
it's a special operator in the air force
and my score was so horribly low that as

145
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:47,510
we take it again and he said,
hey,

146
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,300
I got an 18 the second time,
even worse,

147
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:52,550
I need to get a 50 out of a [inaudible] 
99.

148
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,090
And so my mom and I for a while,
we lived in a government subsidized 

149
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,661
apartments,
$7 a month and also food stamps and we 

150
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:04,520
slowly moved up to $230 a month place.
But at the time,

151
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:05,230
you know,
you know,

152
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,070
pretty poor.
But I'm,

153
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,800
my mom afforded enough money for me to 
go to see a tutor one one hour a week.

154
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,250
So for four hours a month and had six 
months to study for our last test.

155
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,860
I'm going to take the Asvab test three 
times.

156
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,550
And I studied my ass off and passed it.
And I got in the air force and realized 

157
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,990
there was more things in front of me.
I was afraid of water,

158
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,460
terrify the water and um,
I learned how to swim.

159
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,930
But what gets everybody in this training
and all special ops training is to water

160
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:38,300
confidence where they try to pretty much
drowned your ass,

161
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,720
you know,
all of our lives we've been breathing 

162
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,090
and they take that from you and they 
want to see how comfortable you are in 

163
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,311
the water.
And there's only one percent African 

164
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:50,650
Americans in special operations and I 
didn't know anything about African,

165
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,220
like a lot of them are negative,
buoyant,

166
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,800
which I am because the bone density.

167
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,690
I struggled but I'm six weeks into the 
program there was about 25 guys left.

168
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:03,380
I have about 150.
I was there and I was never.

169
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,470
I didn't go to sleep for six weeks of 
the program and I wanted to quit so 

170
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,500
badly,
but it quit everything in my life.

171
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,200
I copied through school.
I wanted to prove people wrong.

172
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,040
And so here I am in this air force 
program starting to get a little more 

173
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,251
confidence,
but this water was kicking my ass and 

174
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,660
six weeks in the program that Dr gave me
a blood test and was I have sickle cell,

175
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,410
sickle cell trait.
Not The anemia but still kill people,

176
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,950
but so they pulled me out training for a
week and when you go from being very 

177
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,091
uncomfortable in that water situation 
and then now you're comfortable and I'm 

178
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:37,780
sitting back watching the guys drown.
I'm not,

179
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,830
you know,
I'm not part of the activities anymore 

180
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:42,830
for this week.

181
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:42,830
I wouldn't get back in that damn water 
again.

182
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,390
So the fear overcame me and all my 
insecurities from my dad from this small

183
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:52,391
town,
from everything started coming back and 

184
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:53,120
even though no one knew how fucked up I 
was kind of create this other person who

185
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:55,890
was tough.
I live with shit all the time,

186
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,920
so me not wanting to go back in that 
water.

187
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,900
The doctor called me back up,
I thought to get like a,

188
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,620
like a medical kick out of the military.
So no quinten for me.

189
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,620
They kicked me out so I can have some 
pride that Dr said,

190
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:08,160
no man,
we can,

191
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,630
you know,
we could put you back in the training.

192
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,500
And I was like fuck.
But after a week I'm like,

193
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:15,060
you know what?
I missed one week.

194
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,490
There's only three weeks left is a good 
chance,

195
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,440
you know,
I could tough this shit out and go on,

196
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,130
but went back to the CEO and the 
commanding officer of the program and 

197
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,350
the sergeant said,
hey,

198
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,140
you guys start from day one because you 
missed,

199
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:28,990
you know,
that,

200
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,760
that we could train him.

201
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,100
And I broke,
I broke.

202
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,730
I,
I,

203
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,980
I couldn't imagine going back through 
that again.

204
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,310
So I made up a lie and I said,
man,

205
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,960
there's sickle cell things really scare 
me.

206
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,880
It was the fucking water wouldn't sickle
cell.

207
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,200
And I pretty much quit even though they 
gave me a medical.

208
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,760
It was,
I quit.

209
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:53,390
So I'm from the age of 19 to age 22,
I went into the job called Tac p where 

210
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:57,120
you control fast movers behind enemy 
lines.

211
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,890
Cool job.
But there's no water.

212
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,720
I was afraid of the water,
so I avoided it.

213
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,380
And um,
again,

214
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,930
125 pounds in that timeframe,
I went from one 75 to almost 300,

215
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,110
two to 97 was my heaviest and I started 
finding things that was comfortable and 

216
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:17,091
the more things I found comfortable,
the more uncomfortable in my mind was 

217
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:18,470
because that voice I was telling you 
about it,

218
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,560
it always was there.

219
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,660
I was just trying to avoid that 
conscience.

220
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:27,070
I,
I wanted to be left alone from that 

221
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,070
conscious and it wouldn't leave me 
alone.

222
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,820
So I got out of the air force and I 
started working for job corps.

223
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,850
Ecolab re spray for cockroaches at 24 
and I'm spraying a different stake in 

224
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:37,650
shakes,
red lobster,

225
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:39,210
whatever from 11:00
at night at 7:00

226
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:41,250
in the morning.
And what changed?

227
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,530
I came home and watched this discovery 
channel show,

228
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,540
um,
class to 24.

229
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,600
I came home from steak and shake.
I sprayed it down last,

230
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,630
get a big old large 42 ounce shake while
crossing the street and get a box that 

231
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,780
mini donuts from 7:11.
Now I drive home for 45 minutes.

232
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,120
This big old fat guy who.
Yeah,

233
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,920
I worked out,
but I was fat.

234
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,190
I didn't run,
didn't it pt.

235
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,320
I hit the gym.
So I'm driving home,

236
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,780
turn the TV on and what comes on and 
discovery channel.

237
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,780
So,
and that's where everything changed for 

238
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:14,780
me.
I uh,

239
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,000
was taking a shower.
I walked out here,

240
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:20,001
these guys and I watched the show and it
made me reflect big time on the piece of

241
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:23,760
shit that I am and I'm exactly what 
people said I was going to be.

242
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,560
So,
so what was on this show that really 

243
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:29,560
struck home?
It was,

244
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,991
um,
I saw these guys going into water so I 

245
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,871
was terrified of it.
I mean I can't even express have you 

246
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:37,320
ever had a big fear and I know a lot of 
fighters have fears and stuff like that,

247
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:42,321
but they get over them,
but a lot of us have these fears that 

248
00:11:42,321 --> 00:11:43,670
you just don't want to fucking face.
And um,

249
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:49,130
I have a lot of them,
had a lot of them and that's what 

250
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:49,530
created the person who's in front of you
today and it will get into that.

251
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,850
But I'm just scared.
Bitch is what I was an but I was 

252
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,681
watching these guys going through hell 
week class to 24 and he's guys ringing 

253
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:00,880
the bell,
quinten dropping their helmet down,

254
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:05,881
rolling out.
A lot of guys is leaving and it made me 

255
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:07,510
reflect on my fears,
my insecurities,

256
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,950
and I saw real men wear,
I thought were real men who are staying,

257
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,430
who are overcoming adversity,
who were overcoming all these different 

258
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,320
things that I had blamed so many fucking
people in my life.

259
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:24,040
My Dad met my mom for not being there 
when I was 14 years old.

260
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,650
My mom was gonna get remarried to this 
great guy.

261
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:30,580
He got murdered and then I moved back to
a small town in Brazil and,

262
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,600
and everybody was applying my learning 
disability,

263
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,010
my,
my skin color,

264
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,290
you know,
meet me being everything.

265
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,550
And so,
um,

266
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,140
I sat there for awhile and I was like,
man,

267
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:43,120
I gotTa Fucking,
I've got it.

268
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:48,210
No one's gonna fucking come to help me.
No one's going to fucking come to help 

269
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:48,550
me.
It's fucking me against me period.

270
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,760
And um,
so I had to man up and I said,

271
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,310
first it got started doing his face in 
every fucking fear,

272
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:56,230
a half,
no matter what the fuck it is,

273
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:56,660
man.
And,

274
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:02,050
and,
and these things would keep me up at 

275
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,931
night.
No one p people who are hearing this 

276
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:05,941
shit,
they will never really understand and 

277
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:06,550
grasp when you face these things and so 
many things,

278
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,770
how they keep you up and haunt you at 
night.

279
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,980
I think there's a lot of people out 
there that know what you're talking 

280
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980
about.
I mean,

281
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:13,980
and um,
so that's what it did.

282
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,960
And I had two options to either be that 
300 pound guy who's spraying for 

283
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:21,820
cockroaches and made a thousand dollars 
a month.

284
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,560
And at 24 years old knowing without 50 
fucking years old,

285
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:29,560
I can reflect on this and think about 
what guy never became.

286
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,950
Or I can totally just sack it up and 
fail and fail and fail entire succeed.

287
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,410
So I started calling recruiters up.
I said,

288
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:39,700
I'm gonna.
Go be a fucking navy seal.

289
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,760
And every recruiter.
So there's a weight and height,

290
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,820
his weight and height limit for to get 
in the military and I was six foot one 

291
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:51,760
and two 97 and I had a prior service 
which was a big deal.

292
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,130
So I called all these recruiters up and 
all of them said,

293
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:55,600
hey,
what're you blah blah blah blah.

294
00:13:55,601 --> 00:14:00,601
They got into conversation.
Steve Vai is even qualified and by the 

295
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:02,020
time I got to my weight would hang up 
pretty much like,

296
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:02,550
hey,
you know what,

297
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,200
call somebody else and they'll try to 
get in the reserves.

298
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:10,710
So I tried to get the reserves and I 
called this guy named Steven Sal job 

299
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,710
recruiter up and he said,
hey,

300
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,710
come on in.

301
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,970
He saw me put me through the weight 
standard,

302
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:17,971
all this other stuff,
and to get into the class I had to get 

303
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:18,790
into how to lose 106 pounds in less than
three months.

304
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,550
So I was like,
fuck that.

305
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:26,551
I can't do that.
I grabbed my chocolate milkshake and 

306
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:26,551
went back to Ecolab.
I'm going to back to work,

307
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:27,340
man.
This is my life.

308
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,060
So in this job you look,
you're looking for cockroaches looking 

309
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,781
for rodents and stuff like that.
And this next morning or the next night 

310
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:39,880
I went to work and I hit the all that 
cockroach is too much.

311
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,300
I hit the mother of cockroaches and this
restaurant got full of cockroaches and 

312
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:48,460
rodents and everything else and I sat 
there and said,

313
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:50,380
this is my life.
I said,

314
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,690
this is my life.
You are exactly who the fuck this is it.

315
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,510
And I said,
this ain't going to be it for me.

316
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,560
So in that restaurant,
I quit my job,

317
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,550
left my canister in that restaurant,
my,

318
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,630
my spray canister,
got back in my ecolab truck and I went 

319
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,360
home and I started working out like 
somebody I was.

320
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,430
I became the most obsessed person on the
planet earth.

321
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,970
And I was basically,
I had to invent a guy that didn't exist.

322
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,310
I had to invent a guy that can take any 
pain,

323
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:24,350
any suffering,
any kind of judgment,

324
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,190
be called nigger because whatever the 
fuck in the world and be able to stand 

325
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:30,190
in the fucking room and say go fuck 
yourself.

326
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,950
And it built out to build this callous 
mine and I built it through suffering.

327
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,760
I built it to downright fucking just 
crushing myself.

328
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:39,290
If it was raining outside,
3:00

329
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,580
in the fucking morning,
it was snowing.

330
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,520
The fourth thing is don't go out there 
and do shit.

331
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,030
My instinct was we got to fucking go out
there.

332
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,220
Anything that was fucking horrible in my
life that I would normally say no,

333
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,940
that was inhumane,
that most people I had to go do it.

334
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,870
And I started callous in my mind at this
point in my life.

335
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,730
And I lost the weight and lost weight.
And I went back to recruiter.

336
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:09,731
I got into that class and I went through
three navy seal hell weeks in one year.

337
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,850
Only guy to ever be in three hell weeks 
in one year.

338
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,660
To my knowledge,
the first one,

339
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:16,280
I didn't make it through the next two I 
did.

340
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,030
And um,
that I just didn't,

341
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,710
I didn't stop it anymore from there.
And I started realizing through this,

342
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:29,630
through this process that the fucking 
mind is what you created.

343
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,230
And I started opening different doors 
that I didn't think were even there.

344
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,230
They didn't think even existed in the 
more doors opened up,

345
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:40,730
the more I started realizing that my 
potential is damn near endless it.

346
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,620
And it changed my whole mindset.
So I went from David Goggins,

347
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,640
I created Goggins.
And that journey is a priceless journey 

348
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:55,211
that is hard for me to even explain to 
people because it sounds so quick and 

349
00:16:55,211 --> 00:16:56,150
easy that guys lost this weight.
And I went through three hell weeks.

350
00:16:56,151 --> 00:17:01,151
I went to ranger school,
I went to Delta Force lex into whatever 

351
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:01,151
it is.
It was brutal.

352
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:03,560
It's a brutal journey every fucking day 
and every well,

353
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,280
are you happy?
If anybody knows my life story and I try

354
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,140
to give you a,
just a snippet of it.

355
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,530
Where I'm at today is in front of Joe 
Rogan telling you my life to get 

356
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,551
through.
I became to get through where I'm at 

357
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:21,251
now.
There's nothing but prior to half for 

358
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:21,950
myself that I can't really.
I can't really show people because I had

359
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:24,020
this face and his face that they see 
like,

360
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,070
are you happy?

361
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,990
What's wrong with you?
I'm driven,

362
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,690
I'm obsessed,
and that's what you see said.

363
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,860
People need to hear the story.
This is a.

364
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:38,861
This is an exciting story for people 
because there's a lot of people out 

365
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:41,801
there that field trapped and they feel 
stuck and they feel like they can't do 

366
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:41,801
anything.
This is who they are.

367
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:46,590
You're a guy who felt that exact same 
way but figured out how to not be that 

368
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,070
person and be a person that you would 
admire.

369
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,900
How did you.
What were the first steps?

370
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:54,300
Like you had some slips before,
right?

371
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:56,430
Because you.
You quit because of the water thing,

372
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,170
but then when you went back the second 
time,

373
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:01,560
when you decide you're going to lose all
that weight and you quit that job did.

374
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,780
Did you.
Was it just straightforward from there 

375
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,441
or whether there's some days where you 
just failed and then you picked it back 

376
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:09,441
up again?

377
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:11,250
So my first run when I decided to lose 
the weight,

378
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,280
I was like I said to 97,
I was about 32 percent body fat and my 

379
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,280
idea was to run four miles from my first
run.

380
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:22,500
I didn't know how bad it's going to 
fucking hurt me.

381
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,330
I used to run before I was fat and I was
like,

382
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:25,230
fuck it,
I can do this.

383
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,760
I ran a quarter mile and walked home.
I walked home and sat on my couch and 

384
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,821
cried.
I went to my mom's house who was about 

385
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:36,120
40 about maybe 20 minutes down the road 
and cried and getting her out.

386
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:36,430
Say,
man,

387
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,030
I can't fucking do this shit.
I don't know.

388
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,150
When do I,
uh,

389
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,420
just got somebody pregnant.
My life was this fucking.

390
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,870
I was making thousand dollars a month.
My rent was eight,

391
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:50,871
10 a month.
And my mind just kept fucking with me 

392
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:50,871
and kept fucking,
you're not good enough,

393
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:50,871
man.

394
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:53,010
This isn't for you man.
These guys are bass motherfuckers on the

395
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:54,180
planet earth.
You're not that.

396
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,260
And um,
what it was,

397
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,900
and it's kind of funny.
I was obsessed with rocky,

398
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,280
rocky one in particular and now as a kid
I come everyday now watch this fucking 

399
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:11,880
show rocky.
And I would fast forward with the little

400
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:16,881
vhs tapes to round 14.
Around 14 fucked me up like nobody's 

401
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:20,460
business.
Why this song came on,

402
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:21,940
right,
so when I bought the pull up record,

403
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:26,941
I listened to the song for 17 hours is 
two minutes and 13 seconds and I'm able 

404
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:32,871
to visualize and dream like nobody's 
business and I know that I can create a 

405
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:38,270
vision that many people can't and I work
for it.

406
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,280
So the vision I had was when Apollo 
creed beat the fucking shit out of 

407
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,680
rocky,
beat the shit out of him.

408
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:44,670
He kept fighting.

409
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,210
He was a dumb fighter,
couldn't read,

410
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:49,680
couldn't fuck that was me,
couldn't read,

411
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:54,681
couldn't write,
just punchy everything a bottom and 

412
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:56,660
rocky beach or shelving.
He isn't at coronary,

413
00:19:56,661 --> 00:20:01,020
but I was saying stay the fuck down.
And him getting up,

414
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,710
him getting up a poetry raises are 
they've been fucking turnaround thought 

415
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,951
he wanted to fight.
He turns around and sees this guy 

416
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:12,000
getting up and it was the face of Apollo
creed that changed my life.

417
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,900
The face of Apollo creed.
It was like just by that motherfucker 

418
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,160
getting up,
not winning just by him getting the fuck

419
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,770
up.
Apollo creed was champ.

420
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,650
He's best.
Rocky had taken his soul,

421
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,400
had literally taken his soul.
His head goes down,

422
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:30,220
he looks at him like,
who?

423
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,950
What the fuck are you?
I want it to be that not rocky.

424
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,410
I want to be the guy that people looked 
at it,

425
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:38,780
I don't give you like me or didn't like,
oh,

426
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,820
I don't care,
but it said this motherfucker's gonna 

427
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,130
keep coming after whatever the fuck is 
in front of him.

428
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,920
I wanted that.
I wanted that.

429
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:50,650
I wanted that worse than anything in the
world,

430
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,280
so that is.
I kept picturing me falling down and 

431
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:59,080
getting up and every motherfucker call 
me nigger.

432
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,970
I was dumped.
Even myself,

433
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,630
even myself,
I wanted to feel something besides two 

434
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,321
feet.
I want it to go the distance and that 

435
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:14,281
going a distance pushed me to a point of
where now go way past the distance.

436
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,100
So you go the first day you,
you run a quarter mile and you walked 

437
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,410
back home and you're,
you're upset.

438
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,790
How do you,
how do you move forward?

439
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:26,500
So basically what I did was I came home 
and I had a chocolate milkshake.

440
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,630
I sat down,
I gave up.

441
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,510
I said,
this ain't gonna fucking happen.

442
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,750
I can lose 100,
six pounds and I can't even go a quarter

443
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,430
a fucking mile.

444
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I started being able to take negative 
shit and be happy.

445
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,650
And this whole.
I say,

446
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:46,390
what if a lot.
It sounds Corny,

447
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,100
it sounds weak,
but it's true.

448
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,420
One of the recruiters said,
there's not many black navy salesman.

449
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,970
I was a 36 African American steel in 
history.

450
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,780
It's an overset careers because the 
fucking water,

451
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,460
you know,
I mean people get mad at me.

452
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,050
It's fucking true.
Just get over it.

453
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,060
And so I was like,
man,

454
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,910
what would it be if my fucking fat dumb 
lie in to be friends with people?

455
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:18,040
Insecure ass can overcome this shit and 
that would,

456
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,160
if mentality that,
that,

457
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,900
that dreamer mentality just with always 
fuel me.

458
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,180
It was fun,
man,

459
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,770
what if I can be,
but if I can be a seal man,

460
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,060
what if I can go from wearing a quarter 
of fucking mile now are going toward and

461
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,840
five miles.

462
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,800
What if I can go with just what if I can
go in and,

463
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,750
and what if,
how would that feel if I'm graduating,

464
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,420
kind of get at that graduation thing.
I talked about 2:24

465
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:46,421
that I like the video.
I sat down and watched this man officer 

466
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:47,060
stood up and he said to the graduation,
um,

467
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,360
gas graduate graduating buds,
like 18 of them,

468
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,940
he said,
we live in a society where mediocrity is

469
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:56,941
often rewarded.
And he went on to say something about 

470
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:59,790
these men detest mediocrity.
And I wanted to be a man that detest 

471
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,810
mediocrity.
It all,

472
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,840
it got me a lot of trouble in the seal 
teams and going forward in my life 

473
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,620
because I just,
I started looking down on people for not

474
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:13,621
going hardest fucking shit.
And I started to create different 

475
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:14,140
things,
but that's for a different day.

476
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,230
But I just believed that,
you know,

477
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,140
my whole mind changed.

478
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,470
That is a problem that a lot of people 
work hard to have.

479
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:24,110
You get angry at people who don't work 
hard to the point where you,

480
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,690
you know,
you want to insult them,

481
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:27,490
you want to,
you want to smack them,

482
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,460
and it's really because you're scared of
seeing that in yourself.

483
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,050
Yeah,
that's probably the truth.

484
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,720
That's probably the truth.
So I guess a lot of times month I would 

485
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,581
see people and it probably was a direct 
reflection of who I was and I would get 

486
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:46,411
mad at them,
but in reflection it's probably just be 

487
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:46,411
getting mad at myself for me,
100 percent when I,

488
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:48,020
when I see people that are half assed 
and things,

489
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:51,080
I get terrified of seeing that in myself
and I get mad at them.

490
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,420
Right.
And it's,

491
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,260
it's not a good way to handle it.
No,

492
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,910
but it's natural because you're just 
terrified of seeing that trait.

493
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,170
Right.
And it cost me.

494
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,770
So you come back,
you do the quarter mile,

495
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,360
right?
You walk back home.

496
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,070
How do you regroup?
So what I did,

497
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:11,240
I sat down there and I put rocky and I 
got my milkshake rocky.

498
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,540
I seen what I was big time in rocky and 
platoon.

499
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Why Platoon,
I love to see people who were getting 

500
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,621
beat down and there's scenes they're 
scenes that this drove me and people in 

501
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:24,550
my hell weeks,
you know,

502
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,600
I was in three of them.
They'd always hear me singing these 

503
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:29,600
songs,
these songs,

504
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,580
humming these songs in torturous 
situations when you're,

505
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,710
when everybody's quitting this fucking 
code.

506
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,180
I would be somewhere gone somewhere 
fucking gone.

507
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:41,680
If somewhere fucking dark as shit.
There's a senior platoon when he lies,

508
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,160
when Barnes shoots relias and you know,
they think he likes his dad and the 

509
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:49,790
choppers are taken off and Charlie 
Sheen's,

510
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,710
ask him,
you know Tom Berenger,

511
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,990
Rizzy,
Elias,

512
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,500
regionalized,
William Defoe.

513
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Oh,
I found them back their dead somewhere 

514
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,500
and through the woods the Viet Cong is 
chasing he through the woods and shoot 

515
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,730
him in his fucking back and all he wants
to do is get to the fucking chopper.

516
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,410
He's getting shot in his back is getting
up,

517
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,440
getting shot back.
He's getting up and you see this guy 

518
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,961
who's fighting.
I love the fucking guy who just fucking 

519
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:17,531
fights.
And so I put these things in as 

520
00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:18,500
reminders that you're going to have to 
fucking suffer,

521
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:20,540
man.
This fucking point two,

522
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:21,110
five,
man,

523
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:26,111
this man,
you're going to have to fucking suffer 

524
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:26,111
to,
to,

525
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:30,090
to,
to go from this fat insecure 

526
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,191
motherfucker too.
One of the best guys on the planet 

527
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:33,191
earth.
This journey's could take something that

528
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:38,141
is going to be incomprehensible to most 
people and these different 

529
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,870
visualizations.
How I visualize it in my self talk,

530
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:47,110
it became so nasty and dirty that I 
almost liked the fact that I went point 

531
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,110
two five.

532
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,360
So it became from being defeated too.
Like,

533
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:51,670
man,
all right motherfucker.

534
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,420
Maybe you know,
maybe the Marvin go point seven,

535
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:54,460
five,
you know,

536
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,400
it just became this different mindset.
I turn negatives into positives,

537
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,430
so I will,
I will take it like who?

538
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,140
Who would even think about doing this?
So I would sit in my car saying,

539
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,960
who had two 97?
Who can't fucking swim?

540
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:07,820
That gray,
who scared the fucking water?

541
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,780
We had the fucking balls,
little balls to fucking man up,

542
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,010
quit a job and go and it put everything 
on himself.

543
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,730
So it's how I started talking to myself 
and put myself in a whole different 

544
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,451
category that would fuel me the next day
and I just kept using that as fuel and 

545
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:25,730
fuel.
No one would do this shit.

546
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,120
No one would do this shit.
You're the baddest motherfucker around 

547
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,120
your bass.
Motherfucker ever live.

548
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,290
And I had ice kept fueling me with the,
with the right kind of message that I 

549
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:35,290
needed to hear.

550
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:40,090
That was never telling myself.
And through time it became reality to 

551
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:45,851
myself.
So you start out on the first day and 

552
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:47,280
then do you start running again the 
second day?

553
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,990
Second day we're wrapped back after it 
again.

554
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,180
But I started realizing I can't run that
far.

555
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:56,390
Right?
So the idea was I became damn near a 

556
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,390
professional cyclist with the miles.
I put it on the bike.

557
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,700
So I never,
we never watched TV.

558
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,460
I had to be doing something.
So I was riding the bike.

559
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,380
I rode a bike a lot to,
to lose the first initial kind of weight

560
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,690
because my bones were hurting so bad.
My bio is broken.

561
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,780
I learned to get over that also.
And I tried to swim a lot,

562
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:15,840
I wasn't a great swimmer,
but putting fins on kind of equalized my

563
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:16,890
body.
I wasn't so negative,

564
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,740
buoyant.
So I started fitting a whole bunch and I

565
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:22,410
spent hours in the pool hours in the 
pool,

566
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,820
trying to get more and more comfortable.

567
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,820
Not because I was going underwater,
I was so scared of the water that I had 

568
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,481
to live in.
The water had to become one with the 

569
00:27:32,481 --> 00:27:33,480
water.
So going into the pool used to scare me.

570
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,260
So I went to the pool an awful awful 
lot.

571
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,340
And then the bike got easier.
I was able to run more.

572
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,580
I went from like one mile,
one mile was a great accomplishment to 

573
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,090
miles and then from two to three was a 
big.

574
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:52,470
And then I went from three to six and 
then like they have a warning order that

575
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:57,471
they get people to get ready for butts 
and the whole thing was running six 

576
00:27:57,471 --> 00:27:58,410
miles five days a week and that was my 
goal.

577
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,140
And so I just kept.
I failed,

578
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,650
I go back to scratch.
I use some positive motivation.

579
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:06,570
I have like one day where I'm like 
fucking defeated,

580
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:12,290
but I started realizing this is part of 
the process that's a part of that 

581
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:12,290
journey.

582
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,260
I had to realize this is part of my 
process versus just saying like I used 

583
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:15,420
to,
I'm just not good enough.

584
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,910
If I'm not good enough,
we always say that shit,

585
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,740
I'm just not good enough and then try 
something else.

586
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,640
I'm going to fucking make myself good 
enough and that became my mentality.

587
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,730
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna.

588
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:28,170
Make myself good enough,
and so I'm misunderstood a lot,

589
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,900
but that's.
That's all it came down to.

590
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,960
I made myself good enough and the days I
couldn't run that for the next week I 

591
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:40,140
would do two a days,
so on the running,

592
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,830
if I ran a quarter of a mile,
I waited fucking couple of hours.

593
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:44,970
It haunt me,
bother me.

594
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,740
I tried to run a half mile.
Next time,

595
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:49,620
same day,
you can do more than this.

596
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,860
If I had to walk out and walk,
it just became just a process of 

597
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:54,960
grinding and grinding and grinding.

598
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,960
Not even a good word for it.
It's not even a good word for it and 

599
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,400
just just going further and further and 
then when I got through running,

600
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,560
I go to the bike,
I go to the pool.

601
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,840
If I got tired somewhere and my legs 
were tired,

602
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,260
I go to the gym and I developed this 
crazy workout where I was doing volume 

603
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,200
like two,
300 reps of like very lightweight.

604
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,220
People are saying how,
you know,

605
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:22,221
how come you don't have any loose skin?
My workout routine in the gym became 

606
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:22,950
sick.
It became sick.

607
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:24,390
I was just doing two,
300 reps,

608
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:29,070
400 reps on my chest,
just like for one simple exercise,

609
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:33,000
the best press and a racket.
Get back on it.

610
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:34,920
Just rep it out.
Trying to burn as many calories.

611
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:37,710
I can't build that muscle mass and I 
just became.

612
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,030
Just became obsessed with it.

613
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:44,420
So when you're doing this,
are you at all about repetitive stress 

614
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,971
injuries or the fact that your body's 
not conditioned for this and you're 

615
00:29:47,971 --> 00:29:50,940
basically taking your body?
Were you abused it and now you're 

616
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,060
forcing it to live?
Like in an elite athlete?

617
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,100
I didn't care.
I didn't know any better.

618
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,200
I didn't think about it.
Wow.

619
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:56,920
I didn't,
I,

620
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,890
I didn't know that.
Working out that harbor.

621
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,450
Fuck you up.
I did it.

622
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:02,440
Fuck you up.
Oh yeah.

623
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,620
Yeah.
That's one reason why I went through 

624
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:07,620
three hell weeks.
So don't talk about a lot.

625
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,270
But um,
the stress of my life getting to 24 

626
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:12,930
caused me have some serious.
So as it's used,

627
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,670
I know anything about this shit too.
So as muscles,

628
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:20,671
what we use as your hip flexor muscle 
and basically under stress it starts to 

629
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:22,870
tighten up.
And I wish I stuttered for,

630
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,570
from the time I was in third grade time 
I was in seventh grade.

631
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,140
White blotches on my skin.
I was just,

632
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,300
I was a nutcase.
And so the insides of me or are also 

633
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,870
getting fucked up.
So in this process,

634
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,940
um,
my psoas muscle got real tight to my 

635
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,810
[inaudible].
I can show you the bumper in the back of

636
00:30:40,811 --> 00:30:43,000
my head after this show's over.
But I had,

637
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:48,030
I started going this fucking like large 
tumor looking bumper in the back of my 

638
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,110
head from my body compressing.
So I'm six foot one,

639
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:55,111
but my muscles were like five foot nine 
because I just started just the muscle 

640
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:57,940
tightness for my solo as go into my t 12
hours,

641
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:59,470
just getting tighter.
My quads,

642
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:02,350
everything,
getting tired from distress to stress in

643
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:07,351
my life.
So the more I stress my body with the 

644
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:08,950
workouts,
my lower body became out of balance.

645
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:13,120
So I had a bunch of stress fractures,
bunch of injuries going through buds.

646
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,600
And how I got through buds was they gave
me my third time was my last time going 

647
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,000
through hell week.
I basically put a black sock on at 4:00

648
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:23,910
in the morning and I would get duct 
tape.

649
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,070
I had at numerous stress fractures on 
both of my legs because my kid,

650
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,460
my body was literally like coming in on 
itself and my legs were like I was.

651
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:36,670
I was protonating really bad and putting
stress on my stress on my shins.

652
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,390
And so I would put duct tape,
duct taped my feet and I will show you.

653
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:45,391
The top of them will have pressure 
ulcers that were the size of quarters 

654
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:45,391
from,
you know,

655
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:49,450
how the ankle joint.
So the foot goes to the Shin and how you

656
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:51,760
move this,
where the tape was so tight,

657
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,480
it just created a nice ulcer right 
there.

658
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,580
And um,
I just,

659
00:31:57,581 --> 00:31:59,080
uh,
just kept going through it.

660
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,720
So you just use that tape to just 
support your ankles.

661
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:06,750
Right.
So I basically kept myself and for the 

662
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:06,750
first 30,
45 minutes,

663
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,591
the pain was excruciating,
but then it would go numb and I would go

664
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:13,400
numb and then that's how I got through.
Wow.

665
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,650
Do any longterm damage?
Oh yeah.

666
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:22,710
I've been out for five years,
so I retired from the 21 years in the 

667
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,940
military at the time in the air force.
And I did about 16 years in the navy.

668
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,350
How old are you?
Forty three.

669
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,720
Seems like you're 30.
That's good.

670
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:29,860
That's good.
And you really,

671
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:34,861
you look very young for your age.
Whenever I'm stressed I get after I 

672
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:36,250
fixed,
I fixed was ever bothering me.

673
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,840
So I,
um,

674
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:42,320
basically over the last five years,
everything I've done in my life,

675
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,620
I did it being very unhealthy.
I,

676
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,830
I'd never talked about it.

677
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,310
I just kept going and it costs me pretty
much.

678
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,010
I was choking my insides out adrenal 
issues,

679
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,900
tons of the general issues,
thyroid issues,

680
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,690
anything with inner consistent,
pretty much shut down on me.

681
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,450
Um,
my organs were pretty much shutting down

682
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,870
and I went from a guy who could run 200,
five miles to guy who couldn't get out 

683
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,510
of bed and the doctors were trying to 
search what was wrong.

684
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,070
That's what I figured out the soda as 
muscle.

685
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,730
No one had figured it out and I hit it 
by accident.

686
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,180
So I've,
I've missed two days of stretching out 

687
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,331
in five years.
And so what happened was all the Shit I 

688
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:19,860
did to myself,
the stress I was under,

689
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:21,020
her physical,
mental,

690
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,400
all kinds of shit.
It just choked me out from the inside.

691
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:30,401
And doctors put me all kind of 
medication and the medication started 

692
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:31,910
doing the exact opposite of what kind of
shirt I was on.

693
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,700
Um,
Dah da.

694
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:37,710
I was on some different things too for 
my estrogen,

695
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,140
different things for my,
um,

696
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:44,770
I was on anything to do with your,
like with your endocrine system of 

697
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,910
thyroid medicine.
I'm good.

698
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:48,500
God,
I was on quarters.

699
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,620
All kinds of shit to get my stuff and I 
like this lump in my throat from like 

700
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:56,450
the heart was always.
I couldn't run down the street.

701
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,730
My body was just jacked up,
couldn't sleep.

702
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,330
My whole body was just shutting down.
I could give you a lot more than that,

703
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:06,110
but just give an example.
I was fucking dying and so I couldn't do

704
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:08,530
anything.
I went from a guy who is this God,

705
00:34:08,531 --> 00:34:10,580
you're a guy who can't do shit.
And Dr.

706
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,700
Like I don't know what's wrong with you 
man.

707
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,070
You know your labs,
your.

708
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:15,590
This is what ptsd is it,
what's going on?

709
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,180
I knew what any of that shit.

710
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,850
So I sat in the bed one day and I 
realized,

711
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:20,810
man,
my life is over.

712
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:26,110
This is it.
But it gave me time to reflect on 

713
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,531
everything I had accomplished because 
I'd never taken time to reflect on the 

714
00:34:29,531 --> 00:34:31,130
kid.
I was the man I am now.

715
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,350
So honestly the time I wasn't working 
out,

716
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,920
it was the best time of my life because 
I got a chance to really reflect back 

717
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,280
and be proud of who I became.
I never took time to do that.

718
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,340
It was like one after another,
get the fuck after,

719
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:45,050
get after it after you ain't good 
enough.

720
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:46,370
Motherfucker get after it,
get after it.

721
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,160
And um,
I got halted.

722
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,190
So anyway,
and this process went on for a while,

723
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,480
more medication.
This isn't working,

724
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:55,700
that's not working.
No doctor can figure it out.

725
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,230
I'm like,
fuck it.

726
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,970
I saw this dark about eight years before
this happened and he was like,

727
00:35:01,971 --> 00:35:03,800
hey man,
you're so fucking tight.

728
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,200
I've never seen anybody in my life as 
tight as you.

729
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,860
You need 50,000
hours of stress.

730
00:35:08,861 --> 00:35:10,760
And he used throughout some crazy 
number.

731
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,500
I was like,
whatever,

732
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,310
stretching,
you know,

733
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,130
stretching stress is bad for you.
So you thought stretch was bad.

734
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,120
I was just baffled that I read some 
article,

735
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,730
you know,
I know man.

736
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,720
Fucking fuck stretching man.
You know,

737
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,160
I worked out so hard.
I'd have time to stress,

738
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:26,390
man.
I was,

739
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,480
I was running about 150 miles a week.
I was back in the mouse.

740
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:30,390
I was getting after it,
man.

741
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,610
I was working a full time job and I'm 
stretching and doing that.

742
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,940
So my body was literally getting tighter
and tighter just from what I was doing 

743
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:39,940
about this.
Because you ran this.

744
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,320
No,
I wasn't that man.

745
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,860
And so I said,
no,

746
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,460
I'm going to try and stretch out so I 
don't do anything for like 10 minutes or

747
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,920
you know,
don't do the six minute abs bullshit.

748
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,950
So I started stressing out one hour,
hour and a half.

749
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,690
Long story short,
man,

750
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,720
I shaved my head almost every morning 
and that bump does on the back of my 

751
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,170
fucking head.
I started realizing it was shrinking for

752
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:06,171
some fucking reason.
I don't know why because I shaved my 

753
00:36:06,171 --> 00:36:06,171
head back and I was like,
it's getting smaller.

754
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,820
It's more that bump got healthier.
I got smarter.

755
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,100
That bump guy was like,
oh,

756
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,560
hold up motherfucker.
But with what's going on that.

757
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,720
So whereas most of us started getting 
more and more stressed out,

758
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:20,721
more and more relaxed and over a period 
of five years from the best shape of my 

759
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,100
damn life right now from stretching out,
wow.

760
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,480
That's all it was.
I went from like,

761
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,910
I can't even count the medications I was
on.

762
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:31,290
Now I'm on a very low dose thyroid pill,
period.

763
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,900
Do you ever do yoga all the time,
man.

764
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,270
All the time.
And I,

765
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:40,300
I,
if I were to tell somebody one thing 

766
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:40,300
right now,
man,

767
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,790
that's so as muscle and getting that hip
flexor opened up because we're all 

768
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:47,130
stressed the fuck out.
It was much worse than others.

769
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,200
It changed my life.
Yeah.

770
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,940
Um,
how do you say nick?

771
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,250
Regardless,
how do you say his last name?

772
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:58,370
The a Brazilian jujitsu black belt from 
England Greek fellow.

773
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:03,860
He has a great quote about yoga.
He said Yoga is a martial art you do 

774
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:03,860
against yourself.
Yup.

775
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,460
It's a great way of putting it.
One hundred percent.

776
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,100
So it feels like when you're in there,
right?

777
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,610
One hundred percent.
And so you.

778
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,590
How many years ago was,
this was five years ago.

779
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,030
And how long was there a period where 
you couldn't work out at all?

780
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,480
There was about.
So I always try to do something but I 

781
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,331
couldn't run.
I could run maybe half a mile and all 

782
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:30,171
that shit would happen and my heart 
would get a fib and all kinds of stuff 

783
00:37:30,171 --> 00:37:31,850
would happen and I started just 
stretching and also I try to do pull ups

784
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,520
every now and then.

785
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,340
But everything was just.
I didn't have the energy,

786
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,410
I didn't have anything.
I mean,

787
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:42,411
nothing was processed in right for me.
So do you think that you've just broken 

788
00:37:42,411 --> 00:37:42,780
your body?
You pushed it too hard?

789
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,760
One hundred percent.
I,

790
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,770
I sat back in that bed that night and I 
had a lot of time to reflect and say,

791
00:37:47,771 --> 00:37:52,771
you know what?
I was actually kind of proud of myself 

792
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:52,771
in a very sick,
twisted way.

793
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:53,110
I,
I,

794
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:58,730
even though people will understand it,
I had to do what I had to do and you 

795
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,730
know,
and I did it.

796
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,650
Like I didn't tell you how I got into 
ultra running,

797
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,480
you know,
there's a lot of things that.

798
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,290
So I,
I pushed extremely hard.

799
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,920
I went way beyond what I thought was 
capable.

800
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,410
Like my first ultra race I did,
I was a,

801
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,450
I was heavier,
I was in Iraq,

802
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,800
you know,
the markets have trail,

803
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,670
lone survivor.

804
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,130
I was in buds,
I was in three hell weeks as you know,

805
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,760
as I said many times and I knew a lot of
guys that died in the operation.

806
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,860
I was at free fall school with mark in 
the trail.

807
00:38:25,861 --> 00:38:28,830
Who's his twin brother during the 
operation where wings,

808
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:33,890
where Marketo was the only survivor I 
knew marcus trowel and I was about 200 

809
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,990
some odd pounds and I didn't run Harley 
all at this time.

810
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,200
I was a seal,
but I was like a bodybuilder and I did 

811
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,930
an elliptical trainer 20 minutes on 
Sunday.

812
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,060
That's all I did.
So I.

813
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:51,060
Did I fuck that cardio stuff?
I was never about it until this 

814
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,480
happened.
So that happened and I was like,

815
00:38:52,481 --> 00:38:57,481
man,
I got find a way to raise money for 

816
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:57,481
these families.
So I googled the,

817
00:38:57,481 --> 00:39:00,160
I found the foundation,
Special Operations Warrior Foundation,

818
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,920
and I googled the 10 hardest races in 
the world.

819
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:08,940
I knew nothing about ultra running the 
first I'd ever run with 20 miles at one 

820
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,700
time and so what came up was the 
badwater 1:45

821
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,780
and 35 mile run through death valley in 
the summertime.

822
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,650
I thought it was a fucking stage race.
I didn't know people could run to her 

823
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,481
and 35 miles at one time had no idea was
even possibly in a stage race where you 

824
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:22,481
run like 20 miles.
Oh,

825
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:26,320
camp out and then run 20 more until you 
get her 35 miles.

826
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:31,380
Right.
So I want an ultra runner to know ultra 

827
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,931
runner was.
I called the race director of Chris 

828
00:39:33,931 --> 00:39:35,230
Cosmin of the bad water and he said,
are you an ultra runner?

829
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,540
And I was like,
I don't know what that is.

830
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:42,570
He goes,
have you run 100 miles in 24 hours or 

831
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:42,570
less?
I was like,

832
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:42,570
no,
but I said,

833
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,300
I'm a navy seal.

834
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,980
I was in three hell weeks.
I was arranged.

835
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:46,660
I gave him some resume.
He didn't give a shit.

836
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,280
He said,
I don't care.

837
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:53,281
You got qualified for my race.
And the deadline was up in two months 

838
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:56,881
for this badwater race and basically he 
said there's two more races you can do 

839
00:39:56,891 --> 00:39:59,290
to qualify and I might consider you my 
race.

840
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,440
We select top 90 athletes in the world 
and not even ultra runner,

841
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,690
but I liked your cost like what you're 
doing.

842
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,070
He said,
uh,

843
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,860
I call him up on a Wednesday and he 
goes,

844
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:13,390
there's a race on Saturday in San Diego,
San Diego one day when you went to run a

845
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:15,520
one mile track for 24 hours,
send miles.

846
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:17,590
You get,
you get 124 hours.

847
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,850
I will consider you in my race.
I did the math is 14,

848
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:22,990
seven minute mile.
Fuck it.

849
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:27,640
I can do that dumb shit thinking I'll 
tell you that right now.

850
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,670
It was rough.
Verse Pain I've been in my entire life 

851
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,760
was this race.
So I have my wife at the time,

852
00:40:33,761 --> 00:40:35,770
she's now my ex wife.
We go to Walmart,

853
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:38,070
get a blue lawn chair.
Which crackers in mild plex.

854
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,330
That's what I'm gonna have for 100 mile 
run.

855
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,860
So,
so,

856
00:40:41,861 --> 00:40:43,120
but the start line,
this race,

857
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:48,690
it was an Aua national championships.
It's like the best ultra runners compete

858
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:53,911
against each other to Sydney Mazda and 
get 24 hours and I'm this big 

859
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:58,300
bodybuilder looking guy.
But back then I would say I was at least

860
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,510
2:30
at least it made them more than jacked.

861
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

862
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,860
I was ripped to fuck up.
I was a big old chest out there.

863
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,290
I was,
I was jacked up.

864
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:12,300
It was a picture of me.
He definitely didn't look like someone 

865
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:12,300
who could run a hundred miles.
No,

866
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,100
not at all.
So basically I started running and I get

867
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:18,700
to about mile 40 mile 50 and I'm feeling
pretty good.

868
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:24,390
I get to mile 70 and it was the worst 
pain in my life.

869
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:29,890
I sat down and this blue lawn chair at 
mile 70 and my,

870
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,540
the Ritz crackers after mile 20 became 
rich.

871
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:34,310
Cracker balls wouldn't hydrate and 
correct it.

872
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:39,311
I didn't know what to do.
I was drinking mile plex from our 

873
00:41:39,311 --> 00:41:39,520
nutrition because I couldn't eat these 
risks.

874
00:41:39,521 --> 00:41:42,230
Crackers have very minimal water,
if any at all.

875
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:47,620
And I was just dying.
So I sat down this blue launch air as I 

876
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,131
was watching these windows go around in 
a circle that was all dizzy and 

877
00:41:51,131 --> 00:41:51,131
lightheaded,
hadn't gone to the bathroom.

878
00:41:51,131 --> 00:41:52,320
It's been about 12 hours.
I'm at 70 miles,

879
00:41:52,321 --> 00:41:53,630
about 12 hours,
which is good.

880
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,900
And looked at my ex wife now and I was 
like,

881
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:02,450
I am fucked.
I started seeing like three of her and 

882
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,920
once my body stopped,
my mind just went off and had to go to 

883
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:10,931
the bathroom and the bathroom was like,
it was like 20 feet away from me if 

884
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:10,931
that.

885
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:12,740
And I couldn't.
And so I sat there and pee blood down my

886
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:16,070
leg and started crapping up my back and 
we're 30 miles to go.

887
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:21,670
I and my feet were broken.
I was just in the worst shape once you 

888
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,750
stopped running.
Not running like that.

889
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,780
I mean I didn't run it almost a year.
I was just doing bodybuilding stuff and 

890
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,130
20 minutes on the elliptical trainer.
No running at all.

891
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,980
I probably ran no shit,
no shit,

892
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:39,500
no more than 50 miles the whole year.
That wasn't my thing.

893
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,310
I want it to be like Jack,
you know,

894
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:46,790
I didn't want to be cardio guy.
I wanted to be ripped big navy seal guy 

895
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,870
and I'm in the day before this race is 
funny.

896
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,740
This guy named Joe Burns who put me 
through my hell week's a seal guy.

897
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:58,430
He's one of the hardest guys out there.
He was in the gym the Friday before I do

898
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:01,340
this race and he was doing a full body 
squats,

899
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,930
deadlifts,
power cleans.

900
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:03,700
Said fuck it,
man.

901
00:43:03,701 --> 00:43:08,701
I don't know he,
he's a guy that approved me to do this 

902
00:43:08,701 --> 00:43:08,701
race.
He knew he,

903
00:43:08,701 --> 00:43:08,701
he,
you know,

904
00:43:08,701 --> 00:43:10,340
he gave me the approval to go do this 
race and signed off on it.

905
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,380
So I'm in the gym.
I went in there,

906
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:17,381
did a full body hardcore squats,
dead lifts and everything with this guy 

907
00:43:17,381 --> 00:43:20,270
because I knew he was going to come 
watch me in this race.

908
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,280
So I've always been about art,
man,

909
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:27,281
you're going to see me come in here and 
Jack this weight and the memorial 

910
00:43:27,281 --> 00:43:28,280
watched me do 100 mile run where you can
think about that.

911
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:33,610
So basically I paid for it.
So he came out there with my favorite 

912
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:34,760
thing,
chocolate,

913
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:39,780
you know,
mini donuts because he knew my story of 

914
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,160
my past life and bought six mini donuts 
out there and I'll have my hat pulled 

915
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,061
down and at mile 70 man it was torturous
and with blood down my leg and 30 miles 

916
00:43:47,331 --> 00:43:48,770
to go,
I,

917
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:52,070
uh,
started reaching and cookie jars.

918
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:57,070
Man,
I started pulling off all kinds of 

919
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,411
stuff.
I reached in my mind and a lot of us 

920
00:43:59,411 --> 00:44:02,291
when we have bad times in life,
even the hardest person where we forget 

921
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:03,170
how bad ass we are during that hard 
time.

922
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,530
I have a thing where I take a couple of 
seconds to reflect on our.

923
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:07,100
Hang on,
man.

924
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:09,260
You've been through this,
you've been through that.

925
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:10,550
You overcame this,
overcame that.

926
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,720
I don't ever close my mind to the fact 
that this can be done.

927
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,770
And I knew I had to get up and eat 
nutrition and hydration.

928
00:44:18,771 --> 00:44:22,730
I need to get it stopped being dizzy.
So that's the first thing I did.

929
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:25,360
I didn't panic on.
I had 30 more miles to go to get 100.

930
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:30,850
I started the process slowly but surely 
I was able to stand up and I was 

931
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,360
literally hobbling around this track 
with just walking,

932
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,590
no running at all.

933
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,960
I couldn't run.
My feet were in the worst pain,

934
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:42,110
worst pain I've been in my entire life.
Nothing in any training is even 

935
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:45,830
comparable to this last 30 miles,
and what happened was my ex wife looked 

936
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:47,970
at me and she's like,
man,

937
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,130
we agreed I'm not going to make the 
time.

938
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,910
I was going way too slow and at that 
time at mile 81,

939
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:57,810
something clicked that I'll never 
probably be able to do again.

940
00:44:57,811 --> 00:44:58,860
When my mind,
body,

941
00:44:58,861 --> 00:44:59,760
Spirit,
soul,

942
00:44:59,761 --> 00:45:04,761
everything is connected in my mind knew 
I wasn't fucking around anymore and knew

943
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:09,951
I wasn't going to quit and knew that guy
was dead and buried and gone and I was 

944
00:45:09,951 --> 00:45:14,721
going to die out here on his fucking 
Walmart for whatever reason why I was 

945
00:45:14,721 --> 00:45:16,440
going to get through this motherfucker.
I don't give a damn.

946
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:18,300
It made no.
There was no fucking crowds.

947
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:19,470
There's no trophy.

948
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:21,300
At the end there was.
I wasn't even in a race.

949
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,670
In my mind.
There was.

950
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,350
It was nothing.
It wasn't about nothing.

951
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:27,630
There was no nothing.
It was a bunch of people didn't know who

952
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:32,631
the fuck I was.
It was me against me and I used all 

953
00:45:32,631 --> 00:45:37,401
these different dark places to start 
bringing out light and just fucking go 

954
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,721
in deeper and deeper in it.
The next 20 miles I ran 101 miles and I 

955
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:44,430
ran the next 20 miles,
ran and about 10:30

956
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:49,431
pace and I did 101 miles in 18 hours and
56 minutes sat back down that Blue Porta

957
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,030
potty.
Now my chair,

958
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:59,031
that guy from Walmart and that's when 
the body realized I was done and this 

959
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:03,130
great feeling came over me,
but also the worst pain in my life.

960
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,150
That's when I took a humongous shit on 
myself.

961
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,660
Literally like I like a fucking log up 
my fucking back pissed so much plugged 

962
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:11,860
them in.

963
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,630
My wife was,
she was a nurse and she was freaked out.

964
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,700
I couldn't get up.
I couldn't stand up.

965
00:46:17,701 --> 00:46:21,930
She backed this camry on the knoll of 
the grassy areas that,

966
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,560
and we were both lifters at the time,
so she was decently strong.

967
00:46:25,561 --> 00:46:28,800
I put my arms around her neck,
she got into the backseat of the car,

968
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:31,260
left the windows down,
no like horrible shit,

969
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,440
and I had this poncho liner because it's
November in San Diego,

970
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:37,590
so I'm sitting her jack him back in his 
car and she was terrified.

971
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:38,570
I need to get your doctor and you take 
it.

972
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:43,430
The doctor says take me home.
So we lived in a second story or,

973
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:47,220
or the second deck of this apartment 
complex in San Diego.

974
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,820
I got to the first deck so I,
I get a car and I can stand up,

975
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,350
but,
but with my arms around her neck,

976
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,550
so I just leaned down.

977
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,590
I was gonna pass out,
got to the SEC,

978
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:58,050
or I got to the first deck,
went down,

979
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:01,230
just couldn't stand up anymore.
Got to run her neck,

980
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,640
worked my way up the railing.
Government dominoes on her neck again.

981
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,430
Walked to the kitchen area,
which is right in the front door.

982
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,670
I was laying on the Poncho liner.
Crap was everywhere.

983
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,420
I managed.
She helped me managed to get into the 

984
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:17,420
toe,
into the tub,

985
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,820
and it was like dirt was coming on my 
penis.

986
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,930
This looked horrible.
It's just a gross thing.

987
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,060
The world is the worst pain I can ever,
ever,

988
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,300
ever be in in my life.
And the craziest thing I'd tell you the 

989
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:29,300
story because right now I'm not 
sadistic.

990
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:34,080
I'm not crazy.
People may think that they may want to 

991
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,571
put a title on me after hearing me 
because it makes them feel better 

992
00:47:36,571 --> 00:47:36,571
because he thinks,
wow,

993
00:47:36,571 --> 00:47:38,570
this guy must be some special artist.

994
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,570
Fucked up crazy dude.
No,

995
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:46,110
I'm a guy that came from nothing.
Anybody's capable of doing shit like 

996
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:47,680
this.
Anybody and I sat in that tub.

997
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,280
She put the water on me.
She called my mom up and my mom was 

998
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:53,280
dating a doctor at the time.
The doctor,

999
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,570
the doctor said,
you need to get him to a hospital now.

1000
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,960
She came back and all I want to do is 
call Chris cost on the phone,

1001
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,140
the race director,
Bob Waters.

1002
00:48:00,141 --> 00:48:02,210
I fucking did it.
So she said,

1003
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,100
I'm taking to the doctor.
I said,

1004
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:05,200
no,
let me sit here and enjoy this pain.

1005
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,870
She said,
what are you talking about?

1006
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,220
I said,
you know,

1007
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:10,720
I go,
I need to go to the doctor.

1008
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:15,721
I realized that,
but I never thought it was humanly 

1009
00:48:15,721 --> 00:48:20,371
possible to do what I did.
I went 70 miles at 70 miles.

1010
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,720
I was dead.

1011
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:28,710
I was at 100 percent what?
I thought what I thought was 100 

1012
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,100
percent.
I went 30,

1013
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:35,730
31 more miles after being in the worst 
physical shape I've ever been in my 

1014
00:48:36,191 --> 00:48:38,110
life.
It all the,

1015
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:43,950
all that pain and suffering and thing 
was going through my fucking body and I 

1016
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:44,380
sat in that tub and and the wires hit 
me.

1017
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:49,770
It was the most amazing feeling of 
accomplishment and I want to be numb.

1018
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,020
I want people to give me drugs and the 
and the numbness,

1019
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:54,010
fucking paint.
I want it to.

1020
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,640
I did this over and as crazy as it 
sounds,

1021
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:03,030
it was the most amazing moment of my 
entire life to overcome such to come 

1022
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:07,591
from this kid who was ms dot Lee himself
and was tortured to this kid,

1023
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:12,490
to this guy.
Now who is able to overcome such amazing

1024
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,520
odds and obstacles,
and I called Chris costs the race 

1025
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,491
director of bad water and he said the 
idea of a 24 hour races to run 24 hours,

1026
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:25,860
you only ran 19 a put doubt in my mind 
that he would let me know badwater.

1027
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:29,380
So a month later or so,
a month and a half later,

1028
00:49:29,381 --> 00:49:32,800
I went to this race called the hurt 100.
So how is it my race in Hawaii?

1029
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,010
Twenty 6,000
feet of climbing was.

1030
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,640
Ali said,
that's all I said.

1031
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,910
That's so crazy.
I mean he,

1032
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:42,010
he's a hardcore dude,
but he didn't know how fucked up I was.

1033
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,810
Right?
And he said,

1034
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:45,530
he didn't say,
well,

1035
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:45,880
you know,
he,

1036
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,950
he didn't say no,
I'm not gonna let you in.

1037
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,140
He put enough doubt in my mind and say,
man,

1038
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,950
I got to do more.
So I was broken.

1039
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,920
I was broken bad.
And like,

1040
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,900
how long did it take you to recover 
physically?

1041
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:04,200
The funniest thing about this,
I tell a story very often I'd signed up 

1042
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,020
for that.
I'm getting to that answer is right now.

1043
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,050
I went into employment and me and my 
wife,

1044
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:13,051
my mom signed up for the first Los Vegas
marathon down the Strip of Las Vegas and

1045
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:15,370
that incident happened.

1046
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:20,170
So I ran a hundred miles before I ran a 
marathon.

1047
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:25,510
Two weeks later,
roughly December fifth was this marathon

1048
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:27,440
that we all signed up for.
I couldn't walk.

1049
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,800
I could not walk.
I was fucked up.

1050
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:35,930
So 10 days or two weeks after this 100 
mile in one race,

1051
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:38,810
I did um,
this marathon,

1052
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,850
December fifth in Las Vegas.
I said,

1053
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,830
you know,
it's the first one I can't run.

1054
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:48,190
Maybe I can walk with my mom.
So I try to go out to this little knoll 

1055
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:48,960
around our grassy area in San Diego.
Try.

1056
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,990
I tried to run laser broken.
I said,

1057
00:50:50,991 --> 00:50:51,740
fuck,
I can't even.

1058
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:54,110
I'm jacked,
can't do shit.

1059
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,880
So I said,
you know what,

1060
00:50:55,881 --> 00:51:00,881
maybe I'll watch you guys do the 
marathon and I'll cheer you guys on 

1061
00:51:00,881 --> 00:51:00,881
whatever.
I said,

1062
00:51:00,881 --> 00:51:03,260
I'll try to walk with my mom.
December fifth happened.

1063
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:09,070
That gun went off 2005,
14 days after I broke myself off and I 

1064
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:12,830
qualified for the Boston Marathon.
I ran a three.

1065
00:51:12,831 --> 00:51:13,160
Oh eight.

1066
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,280
That's crazy.
And what's funny about it know people 

1067
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,570
hearsay's motherfucker.
Even when I tell you the story I 

1068
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,230
dropped.
I want to drop so many names.

1069
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,460
Google it.
Look it up.

1070
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:27,360
I don't give a fuck.
Like elmo.

1071
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:30,890
Seems like I'm making my own story up.
It does.

1072
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:32,650
It almost seems like a to you.
It does.

1073
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:37,810
Like,
like when I tell if I were to hear 

1074
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:37,810
somebody,
like I said,

1075
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:38,060
listen,
you listen to Joe Rogan's podcast.

1076
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,700
I heard some black dude from fucking 
Brazilian and talking about uh,

1077
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,490
this happened,
this happened three weeks.

1078
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:45,890
Ranger school ran a hundred miles,
broke my feet,

1079
00:51:45,891 --> 00:51:50,891
brought my body about this is the 
biggest fucking liar on the planet or 

1080
00:51:50,891 --> 00:51:51,110
ain't nobody doing shit.
He said,

1081
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:55,190
even when I tell my story,
it almost sounds like some made up shit.

1082
00:51:55,191 --> 00:52:00,191
So you got crazies.
You ran a hundred miles before you ever 

1083
00:52:00,191 --> 00:52:00,191
ran a marathon.

1084
00:52:00,191 --> 00:52:04,510
Right?
Then you didn't run again at all and 

1085
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:04,510
he's still qualified for the Boston 
Marathon.

1086
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:05,810
So you ran a three.
Oh,

1087
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:06,650
eight,
right.

1088
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:11,740
For the first marathon you ever did,
ever did two weeks after you ran 100 

1089
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,430
miles with no training and nothing in 
between,

1090
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:18,431
but it gets better than that.
You can see my training log that 

1091
00:52:18,431 --> 00:52:21,881
actually posted up.
So that's when I started training for 

1092
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:27,700
the hurt 100.
So basically what happened was after 

1093
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,421
that I had about four weeks.
What does it feel like to run that 

1094
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:31,421
three?
Oh eight.

1095
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:35,441
If you could barely walk when that gun 
went off something off in my head and I 

1096
00:52:37,551 --> 00:52:40,460
didn't feel that much pain at all 
afterwards.

1097
00:52:40,461 --> 00:52:43,610
I did,
but something happened where I was like,

1098
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,970
the gun went off and that thing came 
back like,

1099
00:52:46,971 --> 00:52:49,310
all right man,
what if.

1100
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:53,450
Because I wanted to qualify for Boston,
that was my goal,

1101
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,460
but I was,
I was jacked up,

1102
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:56,840
you know,
and I,

1103
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:01,841
and I,
and I didn't run as much as I should 

1104
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:01,910
have had all over my Iraq training.

1105
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:07,150
I hit the weights and but my job,
but my goal was when I signed up for it 

1106
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,930
a year early,
I want to qualify for Boston,

1107
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:09,700
which was a three,
10,

1108
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:14,210
59 and I was like,
what if you can qualify for Boston,

1109
00:53:14,211 --> 00:53:16,340
maybe just reading so we will help me 
out.

1110
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:21,140
I spent 101 miles.
What the fuck is 26 miles to me now?

1111
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:26,890
So the mindset going into it was like I 
ran 75 more miles in this so I use it to

1112
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:33,561
my advantage.
So after that happened I ran a feet 

1113
00:53:33,561 --> 00:53:37,131
pretty much broken out.
I will go to the physical therapist and 

1114
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:40,551
they had this compression tape,
compression tape help because my feet 

1115
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,720
were pretty bad off and I would run 70,
8,000

1116
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:46,560
mile weeks and then I went to the hurt 
100 race in Hawaii.

1117
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,650
Twenty 6,000
feet of climbing over 100 miles.

1118
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,920
Probably one of the top five hardest 
hundred mile races in the world.

1119
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,130
I wouldn't even have a real runner.
Yeah.

1120
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,670
I baked a lot of miles by the last,
the last two and a half.

1121
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:04,290
About two months that wasn't a runner 
with out there and got through the race,

1122
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,690
didn't 33 hours,
was the ninth place finisher.

1123
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:12,110
Not many people finished that that year 
and I qualify for badwater and got in 

1124
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:17,090
and I went on to lose weight and train 
hard and I got fifth my first year and 

1125
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:19,020
went back my second year and got third.
When you see you,

1126
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:21,660
when you lost weight,
like what will you eventually when?

1127
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:27,500
So I went to the race about one 97,
lost quite a bit from the bodybuilding 

1128
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,100
time.
That's over a short period of time,

1129
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,510
right?
How did you lose all that way?

1130
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,090
Once again,
I just worked out hard.

1131
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:35,490
I stopped taking my protein so much.

1132
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,350
I got off,
I was on this stuff,

1133
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:41,580
caught a nitrile tech and I got all the 
protein stuff.

1134
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:44,610
I just started.
I started hitting the weight so hard and

1135
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:49,470
I just became a running fool.
Became the black forest gump man.

1136
00:54:49,471 --> 00:54:51,150
Pretty much.
Pretty simple,

1137
00:54:51,151 --> 00:54:52,050
man.
That's what happened.

1138
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:57,290
Now when you say you were using 
compression tape on your feet and your 

1139
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:57,720
feet with Jack Dot,
what was the extent of the injuries?

1140
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:02,710
So basically because of my pronation,
I never figured out because my muscles,

1141
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:08,510
um,
I always had issues with stress 

1142
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:08,510
fractures,
Shin splints.

1143
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:10,560
So I put a lot of pressure on the inside
of my ankles.

1144
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:15,150
And so that there's a tendon that goes 
up the backside of your,

1145
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:19,410
I don't know if it's just your fibia a 
backside that,

1146
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:24,530
that little bone back side of your foot.
It goes right up beside of that law 

1147
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:24,530
rather than inside that bone.

1148
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:29,600
And that thing was just so fluid up on 
both sides that even this flexing,

1149
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:33,390
my foot was just killing me.
So I realized when you can,

1150
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:36,150
when you cast that thing up,
Kathy,

1151
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:38,200
my feet always helped me out because it,
it,

1152
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,730
it locked my foot into position that 
would've made me protonate as much.

1153
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,180
So between the caffeine of that,
and if,

1154
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:49,200
if he wants the badwater video of 2006,
you'll see me crossing the finish line 

1155
00:55:49,231 --> 00:55:54,231
with this compression tape.
Literally like flying on my ankles 

1156
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:58,851
because I went to the race with 
compression tape on my ankles and so 

1157
00:55:58,851 --> 00:56:01,350
basically I'd have that on my,
on my ankles.

1158
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:06,710
I had inserts in my,
in my shoes and also this wedge on the 

1159
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:11,751
back heel of my left foot so then it 
would keep me from eating that heal so 

1160
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:15,771
much.
So I had all that on just to go run and 

1161
00:56:15,771 --> 00:56:19,250
I ran my ass off and went to badwater 
2006 and with a compression tape on my 

1162
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,170
feet and walked a lot.

1163
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:28,740
But I got third place.
Do you always run with regular running 

1164
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:28,740
shoes?
I do,

1165
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:32,310
yeah.
So now I don't have those issues 

1166
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:33,931
anymore.
All this stretching has opened my body 

1167
00:56:33,931 --> 00:56:33,931
up to where you know how it should've 
been.

1168
00:56:33,931 --> 00:56:36,040
So my alignment is pretty good.
It's not perfect.

1169
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,370
So now I just run a regular running 
shoes now.

1170
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,540
Now no more compression tape number and 
all that stuff.

1171
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,190
So if you see now if you look down 
there,

1172
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:47,191
you'll see the compressed it and you'll 
see my ex wife here in a second taking 

1173
00:56:47,191 --> 00:56:52,060
their can present tape off of me.
She's doing it right now to see her 

1174
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,270
right now.
She said tape,

1175
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,100
you know.
So that's the tape right there.

1176
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:55,930
It had to wear everyday of my life to 
run.

1177
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:00,160
So as you see this story may be kind of 
unbelievable,

1178
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:01,750
but there some proof right there.

1179
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,110
So that's how it was.
So painful.

1180
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:10,160
Yeah,
I was pretty fucked up as you see right 

1181
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:10,160
now.
I'm trying to get all mad.

1182
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:10,160
Yeah.
I'm,

1183
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,440
I'm pretty destroyed right there.
What is the most amount of miles you've 

1184
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,540
ever run at one time?
Yeah.

1185
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,310
Two hundred and five and 39 hours.
Nonstop.

1186
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,320
Woo.
Yeah.

1187
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:27,330
I've had quite a few people on or met 
quite a few people now over the last 

1188
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:29,410
year or so that have run ultras.
Courtney Dot Walter.

1189
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:29,890
You know,
she.

1190
00:57:29,891 --> 00:57:32,740
Is She wanting to Moab?
Yeah,

1191
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:34,270
I heard about already rather than heard 
about it.

1192
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,380
Yeah.
She uh,

1193
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,950
she beat all the men by 22 miles.
Something like that.

1194
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,210
Some crazy thing.
She was first place winner.

1195
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:43,300
She beat everybody else a second place.
One road.

1196
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:49,020
And with her,
I mean he would never believe it when 

1197
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:49,870
you talked to her.
She seems so normal.

1198
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,680
She drinks beer and eating.
Nachos needs candace ultra runner.

1199
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,680
Man.
She's just silly and she's fun and does 

1200
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,920
no demon there.
Like waiting to meet a demon,

1201
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:00,970
you know,
I'm like,

1202
00:58:00,971 --> 00:58:02,190
where's your demon?
Right.

1203
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:04,690
Like how are you getting through her 
demons?

1204
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:06,020
A quiet demon.
It's,

1205
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,570
it's there.
It has to be.

1206
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,700
There's something,
there has to be.

1207
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:12,070
There's no other people to everybody.
I know that,

1208
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,770
that can do that as a demon.
A lot of us don't want to admit to shit.

1209
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,070
Yeah,
we got them.

1210
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,980
Oh 100 percent.
It has to be.

1211
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:23,790
So when you do this and you qualify and 
you,

1212
00:58:24,361 --> 00:58:26,320
you do that race in Hawaii,
right?

1213
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,840
They just let you in after that.
No.

1214
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:30,660
So the race in Hawaii?
Yeah.

1215
00:58:30,661 --> 00:58:33,760
I actually called the race director up 
and there wasn't like a big time.

1216
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,990
Like I didn't have 100 mile race.
I believe it's.

1217
00:58:35,991 --> 00:58:40,991
I had and see the 100 mile.
You did the Boston marathon or you did 

1218
00:58:40,991 --> 00:58:42,310
the Vegas Marathon?

1219
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,430
Yeah.
So I did a hundred miles.

1220
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,990
100 more miles.
The Vegas Marathon with the hurt 100.

1221
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,560
Did that hundred miler and all this is 
in a very short amount of time.

1222
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:52,780
Yeah.
So November was the first 100 miler.

1223
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:58,140
December was the 26 miles in Las Vegas.
January was the next hundred miler in 

1224
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:00,720
Hawaii.
You know,

1225
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:05,730
fucking crazy.
That is like say if I was your friend 

1226
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:05,730
and I called you up on October 20th.
I go,

1227
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:06,280
hey man,
how many times do you run?

1228
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,370
I run every now and they sent him crazy.
I know if you can pull it up or not,

1229
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:11,530
but if you could pull up my race 
schedule for 2007,

1230
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:14,850
just pull up David Goggins race results.
You can see something real crazy.

1231
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:19,150
And second they say this is good.
I gotta show you proof because why?

1232
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,290
I know my story doesn't make any but 
this.

1233
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:27,310
Look at the dates of these races and 
we're going to show it to you in a 

1234
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:27,310
second.

1235
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:29,120
It's,
I'm just look at the hundred miles.

1236
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:34,170
Fifty miles back to back weekends.
How many weekends there were between 

1237
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:34,640
races.
So if you look right here,

1238
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:37,070
you can't really see it.
So we've looked at 2007.

1239
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:38,810
Yeah,
go all the way down.

1240
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:42,580
Keep on going and telling $70.
Racist there too.

1241
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,080
That.
Okay,

1242
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,840
get right there.
So hundred miler,

1243
00:59:44,841 --> 00:59:46,330
Hawaii.
Oh Geez.

1244
00:59:46,331 --> 00:59:47,650
Look up first.
Uh,

1245
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,890
two weeks later,
three weeks later,

1246
00:59:48,891 --> 00:59:51,980
another one that's 50 miler,
50 miler,

1247
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:55,640
um,
a month later you're looking at what?

1248
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:59,240
Fourteen days later,
another 50 k 50 miler.

1249
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,390
A month later they look at less than a 
month.

1250
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,960
Another 50 miler,
50 miler in June.

1251
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,760
July was another hundred.
Miler.

1252
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:12,790
Badwater was literally bad one.
It was a month after I did that 100 

1253
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:13,360
miler.
One hundred 35.

1254
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:17,210
Our leadville was less than a month 
after badwater.

1255
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,900
They're playing 100 was three weeks 
after leadville.

1256
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:26,470
Um,
Angel's crest was to attend date a week 

1257
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:28,970
after that 100 miler,
the bear 100 was a what?

1258
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Thirteen days after that 100 milers.
She and then I ran the 200 and it said 

1259
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,850
two and three point five,
but I didn't ran towards his tour and 

1260
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:41,521
five miles around there.
But what's not in there was that 

1261
01:00:41,521 --> 01:00:43,730
mcnaughton race I did in 2,850
mile race.

1262
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:49,330
Also did in 2007 that wasn't listed.
So that was just my 2007 year.

1263
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:51,410
That's insane.
Yeah.

1264
01:00:51,411 --> 01:00:53,810
So do you think that is what fucked your
body up?

1265
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,860
No,
no,

1266
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:59,950
no,
because I still run the same mileage 

1267
01:00:59,950 --> 01:00:59,960
now.
We're fucked my body up as hell week.

1268
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,580
Really?
Oh yeah.

1269
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,380
You don't go through three hell weeks in
one year.

1270
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:08,670
So I.
So what happened was when I realized 

1271
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:08,670
that my body was really jacked up,
which I went,

1272
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:10,520
I was a big time squatter,
love squatting,

1273
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,630
and I went through the first hell week,
got messed up.

1274
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:15,800
Second Hook I got all the way through.

1275
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,270
Then third,
hope we could get all the way through.

1276
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:22,280
And my third hell week we hit.
We had a guy die on Thursday and then 

1277
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,900
that whole weekend and I graduated 100 
done pulmonary edema.

1278
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,000
It was a code name was John Scopp Code 
is fuck hell week.

1279
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:33,650
The Pacific Ocean's never warm and it 
rained the whole time.

1280
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:35,740
The whole time was rain and he,
um,

1281
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:37,890
pretty much just drown in his own 
fluids.

1282
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:42,910
Pretty much.
We were in the pool doing some 

1283
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:42,910
evolution.
He sunk to the bottom,

1284
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:43,460
um,
his temperature was hot.

1285
01:01:43,461 --> 01:01:45,710
He,
he missed a lot of hell week for getting

1286
01:01:45,711 --> 01:01:48,710
pulled out for different stuff.
He wouldn't quit and um,

1287
01:01:48,711 --> 01:01:50,390
he ended up dying and he'll wait.
But um,

1288
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:51,770
yeah,
so anyway,

1289
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:54,370
after hell week ended,
um,

1290
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,470
I want to go back to the gym,
you know,

1291
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:58,160
second phase happened,
die phase,

1292
01:01:58,161 --> 01:01:59,960
like I could get back in the gym,
start jacking my weight.

1293
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,260
I Love Jack and wait.
And I realized I couldn't squat.

1294
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:07,310
So I went from squatting a lot too.
I couldn't even squat the bar because my

1295
01:02:07,311 --> 01:02:08,910
lower back was all fucked up and I was 
like,

1296
01:02:08,911 --> 01:02:13,310
I don't know what's going on.
It was because there's this muscle so it

1297
01:02:13,311 --> 01:02:18,311
hell week your hip flexors are.
So I went through so many of them so 

1298
01:02:18,311 --> 01:02:21,780
fast and so the hardest part of buds I 
went through three times,

1299
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,010
not,
not the hell week part,

1300
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:26,880
one of the hardest parts,
but it was the initial part of the where

1301
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:30,300
everybody sees on tv,
the log pt to Surf,

1302
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:33,110
torture the Dag on boats over your head,
law,

1303
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:38,180
all that shit.
I went through that person three times 

1304
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:40,080
in one year and um,
over a period of time my hip flexors got

1305
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:45,081
so tight that is jack me up a jack me up
from my hip flexors,

1306
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:50,450
so always been so cold and so stressed 
out and everything led up to it.

1307
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:55,790
But this really was the part that I 
noticed I could squat before hell week 

1308
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:57,990
or before my first time going to bud's 
after,

1309
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,540
after Bud's,
I couldn't,

1310
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:05,690
I couldn't squat anymore.
Do you just think it might just be 

1311
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:06,270
because your body was exhausted?
No,

1312
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,160
because I,
I for 12 years,

1313
01:03:08,161 --> 01:03:10,510
so I would go back and tough it out.
Like,

1314
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:11,970
like with Joe Burns,
he was squatting.

1315
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:12,510
So I said,
fuck,

1316
01:03:12,511 --> 01:03:16,280
I'm going to squat with Joe Burns,
but I just couldn't squat because that,

1317
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:19,410
that muscle was attached to your t 12.
So what was it doing to.

1318
01:03:19,411 --> 01:03:20,480
Is it locking up?
There was,

1319
01:03:20,481 --> 01:03:25,481
this is just pulling.
So it made my hips feel like I couldn't 

1320
01:03:25,481 --> 01:03:26,270
sync my ass.
I couldn't think.

1321
01:03:26,271 --> 01:03:27,870
So it's,
it's incredible pain.

1322
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:32,370
And then with the weight pushing me down
and then try to push up,

1323
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,740
the pain was just too much.
So it was,

1324
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:36,110
oh,
this is all range of motion.

1325
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:37,590
Range of motion issues.
Yeah.

1326
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:39,780
Wow.
That's an important thing for my friend.

1327
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:41,220
Cam Haynes,
who doesn't stretch?

1328
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,790
He's another friend of mine who runs 
ultra races.

1329
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:48,780
He ran that Moab to 40.
He's run the big foot two.

1330
01:03:48,781 --> 01:03:50,220
Oh,
five is when a few of those.

1331
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,260
Right?
Um,

1332
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:53,370
I know he's listening.
Go stretch dude.

1333
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,610
He has support,
man.

1334
01:03:54,611 --> 01:03:56,490
It was.
Especially if you're working that hard,

1335
01:03:56,491 --> 01:03:57,960
right?
If you're doing that much.

1336
01:03:57,961 --> 01:03:58,620
Yeah.
You're,

1337
01:03:58,621 --> 01:04:00,960
you're definitely locking up.
He could barely touch his toes.

1338
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,100
Yeah.
That's not a good thing.

1339
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,030
That's not good.
No,

1340
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:03,670
no,
no.

1341
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,310
It comes back to her chin inside pretty 
soon.

1342
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,570
Now.
How flexible you now,

1343
01:04:06,571 --> 01:04:11,571
because I would imagine you probably a 
fucking ballerina at this point because 

1344
01:04:11,571 --> 01:04:12,420
it's sad when your brain.
I'm trying to get there.

1345
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:17,720
I'm trying to get there.
So I stretch every night for these two 

1346
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,881
hours.
This is the thing that people said that 

1347
01:04:19,881 --> 01:04:19,881
it'll always pissed me off because I'm 
pretty flexible.

1348
01:04:19,881 --> 01:04:20,080
They said,
oh,

1349
01:04:20,081 --> 01:04:21,330
well,
you're naturally flexible.

1350
01:04:21,331 --> 01:04:22,800
People have a natural threshold.
Like,

1351
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,090
no,
they don't.

1352
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,650
Like a doctor told me that.
I go,

1353
01:04:25,651 --> 01:04:26,730
you don't know what you're talking 
about.

1354
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:28,140
I'm like,
you don't know what you're talking about

1355
01:04:28,141 --> 01:04:30,190
because most people don't push 
themselves past that pain,

1356
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,930
that stretch pain,
right.

1357
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,170
People want to put a title on your man.
It's easier for them.

1358
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,360
Just fucking natural.
Natural.

1359
01:04:36,361 --> 01:04:38,130
Exactly.
Now you don't work hard enough,

1360
01:04:38,131 --> 01:04:39,420
motherfucker.
Yeah.

1361
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:41,670
People don't like.
Champs aren't usually flexible.

1362
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,160
You have to,
you have to force yourself to do this.

1363
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:45,330
Right.
And uh,

1364
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:47,820
I know it because I had a friend,
my friend tom or dog now,

1365
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,320
he was a football player,
Jack,

1366
01:04:49,321 --> 01:04:54,321
big thick dude.
Terrible flexibility was taking 

1367
01:04:54,321 --> 01:04:54,750
taekwondo with me.
And over the course of a couple of years

1368
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:57,690
I saw that dude eventually develop a 
full split and you go.

1369
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,610
And he just did it through his mind.
He just was.

1370
01:04:59,611 --> 01:05:04,611
Everybody else was done training.
That guy would be on the mat constantly 

1371
01:05:04,611 --> 01:05:07,971
stretch and always working out because 
he had built his body up so strong all 

1372
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:10,580
those years of squatting and lifting 
that he just,

1373
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:12,630
you know,
he was all tents and everything was just

1374
01:05:12,631 --> 01:05:14,430
like this super powerful.
Right.

1375
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,500
But all like very tense.
That's why I stopped.

1376
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,160
That's what I never stretched

1377
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,770
because I wanted to strength.
Yeah.

1378
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,070
You weren't that tight muscle,
but.

1379
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:22,720
No,
I don't think it stupid.

1380
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:27,820
Yeah.
I think you're not supposed to stretch 

1381
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,731
before you do big physical activities 
because I think it does like we can use 

1382
01:05:29,731 --> 01:05:31,810
somewhat,
but I don't think being flexible overall

1383
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:34,420
makes you weak or not at all.
Not at all.

1384
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:36,010
What certainly doesn't from martial 
arts,

1385
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:39,730
because you need that flexibility to 
have leg dexterity to be able to kick.

1386
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:45,260
It's got to be fluid where it's not 
tightened up by restriction of the 

1387
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:45,460
motion of your body.
I get it.

1388
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,410
It's truth.
I just think people are,

1389
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,150
for whatever reason,
and A.

1390
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:52,750
I'm one of those.
I drone on too much about yoga.

1391
01:05:52,751 --> 01:05:55,360
I'm like one of those vegans.
It's like you gotta do it man.

1392
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,720
I get annoying like a born again 
Christian or something.

1393
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,520
It's like I'm getting that way now,
man.

1394
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:03,670
I'm getting that way now for anybody who
does anything to hard.

1395
01:06:03,671 --> 01:06:08,671
Like you know,
if you do anything like with weight 

1396
01:06:08,671 --> 01:06:12,350
lifting type shit or martial arts type 
shit where it's just everything's 

1397
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:13,270
explosion.
It's lifting,

1398
01:06:13,271 --> 01:06:14,440
it's heavy,
it's push,

1399
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:19,441
push,
push yoga to balance your shit out and 

1400
01:06:19,441 --> 01:06:19,441
we'll,
yeah,

1401
01:06:19,441 --> 01:06:24,191
we'll really.
Well man and this all these people that 

1402
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:26,041
resist it.
Like there was some article recently 

1403
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:27,700
that was something along the lines of 
hot yoga is just trendy nonsense.

1404
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,960
I read that and then even in the article
it talked about that there might be some

1405
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:36,961
benefits in terms of like the 
strengthening your arteries and they 

1406
01:06:36,961 --> 01:06:39,250
didn't even mention heat shock proteins 
is a study going on right now.

1407
01:06:39,251 --> 01:06:44,251
I believe it's at Harvard.
One of my friends was telling me about 

1408
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:47,611
it where they're.
They're trying to find the benefits of 

1409
01:06:47,611 --> 01:06:50,491
90 minute hot yoga classes because they 
think it might mirror the observed 

1410
01:06:50,491 --> 01:06:54,991
benefits of sauna which they already 
know for a fact has big benefits because

1411
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:57,760
of your body producing heat shock 
proteins.

1412
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,980
To deal with the heat.
That's why I put that song in here,

1413
01:06:59,981 --> 01:07:01,570
man.
I go in that fuck her all the time,

1414
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:03,910
but no one can tell me it doesn't work.
It's big.

1415
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,620
It's proof positive.
That changed my life.

1416
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:08,020
It wasn't a medication or this or 
address.

1417
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:09,490
It was stretching.
Yeah,

1418
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,510
it was yoga,
stretching.

1419
01:07:10,511 --> 01:07:15,511
All that stuff combined changed it,
but I just think it balances out your 

1420
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:18,811
body in those static poses where you're 
just holding the pose and it just works 

1421
01:07:20,111 --> 01:07:22,060
you out in a weird way.
They to percent.

1422
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:25,330
You just don't get lifting weights or 
hitting the bag or anything.

1423
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:27,460
You're just not going to get that.
That kind of working out.

1424
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:29,500
I can't agree with you more.
It's so difficult.

1425
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,220
It's crazy.
Get your ass off.

1426
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:33,790
You're enjoying housewives and shit and 
be like,

1427
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:36,140
this is like the silent struggle.
It's humbling it.

1428
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:39,610
Nobody knows.
If you see like two doorways,

1429
01:07:39,611 --> 01:07:44,611
right?
And one of them is like fucking ct Ali 

1430
01:07:44,611 --> 01:07:47,290
Fletcher's fucking super pumped iron 
addicts gym,

1431
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:51,250
which is hard work and then right next 
to it is the yoga studio.

1432
01:07:51,251 --> 01:07:51,910
You're like,
well,

1433
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:54,460
once you get done with all that hard 
work,

1434
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:56,570
you'll go over to that yoga studio.
No,

1435
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:58,690
there's two different kinds of hard work
going on.

1436
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,820
It's no joke.
Two different kinds of hard work.

1437
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:05,910
Yes sir.
So what do you do now in terms of like 

1438
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:09,331
you got over this five years ago,
you're in this bad situation where your 

1439
01:08:09,331 --> 01:08:11,410
body's not working right now.
Everything's working great again.

1440
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:13,840
Well,
I had two heart surgeries also.

1441
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,890
Whoa.
So

1442
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:20,120
your heart.
So I had a hole in it so you know,

1443
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:25,180
you're not supposed to have a hole in 
your heart and be a ceo and it would be 

1444
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:25,180
born with it.
I was born with it.

1445
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:28,130
It went undetected and me pushing so 
hard.

1446
01:08:28,131 --> 01:08:33,131
So in 2009 I was training for this race 
across America and um,

1447
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,970
I,
I just couldn't go anymore.

1448
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,040
Another pitfall in my life was the 
whole.

1449
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:40,550
And I was pretty much off active duty 
seal for three years.

1450
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:43,010
Then I had to harsh with them trying to 
fix it.

1451
01:08:43,011 --> 01:08:44,960
So the whole was significantly large 
account,

1452
01:08:44,961 --> 01:08:48,620
big it.
They say it was big as a quarter and I'm

1453
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:49,940
like,
how the hell is big as a quarter?

1454
01:08:49,941 --> 01:08:54,941
Yeah,
that's a pretty big hole in your heart 

1455
01:08:54,941 --> 01:08:54,941
because they had to helix patches.
I'm like,

1456
01:08:54,941 --> 01:08:56,720
that's impossible that the helix patches
there in my heart.

1457
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,640
So the two stents,
what is a helix patch?

1458
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:01,190
It is like a,
a little Mesh.

1459
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,790
Very like what they do for Hernias.
Like something like maybe something like

1460
01:09:04,791 --> 01:09:09,791
that.
So they were in my artery and they 

1461
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:09,791
placed this patch.
But to go through your artery?

1462
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:14,830
Yeah,
they went through my for more artery 

1463
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:14,830
with a camera?
Yeah,

1464
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:15,470
with the other cameras down through my 
throat.

1465
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:20,690
Whoa.
And they put this catheter through my 

1466
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:21,290
artery that went to my heart.
They,

1467
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,220
they went and they took this helix 
patched that.

1468
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:30,280
They placed it in there and then they 
found out six months later at the whole 

1469
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,560
wasn't covered up enough yet because a 
whole,

1470
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,560
the,
the patch was very damn big hit.

1471
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,840
So they put on and they go back in there
in 2010.

1472
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:42,730
How's the patches adhere to your heart?
I guess your heart heals around the 

1473
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:42,730
patch.

1474
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:43,700
So.
But how did they stick it in place?

1475
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:48,680
I guess they put it with the holes that 
and then it Kinda like inflates.

1476
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,330
Oh Wow.
The whole is at.

1477
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,340
And then that thing goes in there and 
then it kinda covers a whole.

1478
01:09:54,341 --> 01:09:59,341
And then the heart.
So there's two things in my heart right 

1479
01:09:59,341 --> 01:10:00,230
now that the heart kind of covered up.
Whoa.

1480
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,390
Okay.
So here's the job.

1481
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:02,830
Go.
Jamie's got a,

1482
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,600
an image of it for us.
Whoa.

1483
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,040
So it's attached to this little probe.
Right?

1484
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,590
And then they put it over the area where
the injury is.

1485
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:15,290
Wow,
that's insane.

1486
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:16,900
Yeah.
Atrial septum defect was,

1487
01:10:16,901 --> 01:10:21,500
I had atrial septal defect.
So basically everything I had done I got

1488
01:10:21,501 --> 01:10:22,880
from Madison.
Oh Shit.

1489
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:24,920
It's crazy.
I'll be done.

1490
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,200
That's so crazy that they could do that.
Yeah.

1491
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:29,870
So I was out for um,
I was off activity for three years,

1492
01:10:29,871 --> 01:10:30,440
so I stuck.

1493
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,600
I was in the recruiting area for three 
years trying to get back on active duty 

1494
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,180
and that's,
that was my life for three years.

1495
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:40,610
So they put that patch in.
Yup.

1496
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,290
And now your heart.
One hundred percent.

1497
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:44,390
It's 100 percent.
One hundred percent.

1498
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:45,490
Wow.
Yeah.

1499
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:46,910
That's incredible.
Yeah.

1500
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:51,050
I was losing blood and I was just.
I was a bad off.

1501
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:54,290
Which is amazing that you were able to 
do all that with a hole in your heart.

1502
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,710
That's what the doctors were saying,
you know,

1503
01:10:55,820 --> 01:11:00,820
because they ain't know I was a seal.
So I went in and the doctor that found 

1504
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:02,900
the whole are,
he gave me ekg is all this stuff.

1505
01:11:02,901 --> 01:11:06,430
Once again man,
you as after I ran like 200,

1506
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,460
five miles,
you know,

1507
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,470
they made you're in great shape.
I'm like,

1508
01:11:09,471 --> 01:11:11,330
man,
I just don't feel good.

1509
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:14,040
Like walking up the stairs is making me 
jacked up.

1510
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,330
So Dr Doc Shrek,
he's like,

1511
01:11:17,331 --> 01:11:18,170
you know,
gave me Ekg,

1512
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:20,430
can go to the doctor,
get an echocardiogram.

1513
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:24,930
So I'm in there getting echocardiogram 
just chilling out in there and the guy's

1514
01:11:24,931 --> 01:11:29,931
talking to me,
he has his little one and my heart were 

1515
01:11:29,931 --> 01:11:30,300
bullshitting the boss stuff and he,
when people get quiet,

1516
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,140
fucking not good man.
So He's in there.

1517
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,880
This head is one of my heart chilling 
out.

1518
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:37,290
Yeah man,
what are you doing?

1519
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:38,460
Hey,
what's going on?

1520
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,120
Like.
And he says,

1521
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:44,700
I'll be right back.
He goes and gets a doctor.

1522
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,100
Dr Comes in,
puts things on my heart,

1523
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:53,130
the doctor gets another doctor now.
I'm just freaking the fuck out.

1524
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:53,780
I'm like,
okay,

1525
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:55,680
cause when it comes to your heart,
when that was a big deal.

1526
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:57,870
So they come back in and said,
hey,

1527
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:01,440
we can stop the echocardiogram when he 
talked to yet in the hallway,

1528
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:06,210
you have a hole in your heart.
And the guy didn't know that I was,

1529
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:11,420
he knew I was a navy guy,
but I think he was a ceo because not 

1530
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:11,940
many black guys are seals.
And he had a conversation about,

1531
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:14,550
you know,
we got fix this real quick.

1532
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,060
I said,
yeah,

1533
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,740
I mean then I came up,
I was the seal.

1534
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:18,150
He said,
man,

1535
01:12:18,151 --> 01:12:20,760
you could've died jumping,
you can die diving,

1536
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:25,820
you could have died and all this stuff 
because basically the hole in your 

1537
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:25,890
heart,
if it gets plugged with something,

1538
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:27,460
like anything like,
you know,

1539
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,600
let's say you get a bubble from diving 
or something like that,

1540
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:31,750
you gonna die,
right?

1541
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,500
So I,
I,

1542
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:36,000
I call it luck.
I called look.

1543
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,770
Wow.
So I uh,

1544
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,960
I got through two surgeries,
they put it back on,

1545
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:41,610
I lost the,
give you the first one,

1546
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,340
and then when did they realize that it's
not good enough,

1547
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:46,320
so they take you back and you can get a 
bubble study,

1548
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,940
a bubble test.
So they,

1549
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,790
so they like literally send bubbles that
way,

1550
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,240
safe bubbles that way to see if the 
bubble goes through your heart.

1551
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:59,540
So they have this,
this echocardiogram again and they hook 

1552
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:03,801
you up I think to id or something like 
that and they throw these bubbles 

1553
01:13:03,801 --> 01:13:06,501
through your heart and they see if it 
goes through after six months when it 

1554
01:13:06,501 --> 01:13:08,670
should have been healed up,
the bubble went through.

1555
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:11,460
So I had to tell me then,
hey,

1556
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,080
we got gotta,
you know,

1557
01:13:13,081 --> 01:13:14,670
you're not,
you're not good to go.

1558
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:20,180
So I had to take a year before I can 
have another surgery because one,

1559
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:23,730
two,
because that patch had to be completely,

1560
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:27,000
completely healed before they can go 
back in time.

1561
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:28,770
You knew you had a whole right?
So.

1562
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:31,800
So they knew how to hold because of the 
heart surgery all the time.

1563
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:34,620
Like when you're waiting for a deal,
you know you have an extra hole.

1564
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:35,070
Yes,
I know.

1565
01:13:35,071 --> 01:13:37,890
I have a whole what we're allowed to do 
with your body then.

1566
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,390
Well at that time they go,
you know,

1567
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:42,990
do how you feel comfortable and so,
you know,

1568
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:47,070
the whole is not going to kill you right
now but you can't die.

1569
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:52,100
You can't jump.
You pretty much willing to steal 

1570
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:54,170
anymore.
So I was a recruiter for a period of 

1571
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:54,170
time.
Um,

1572
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:57,260
so basically I was crazy about that is 
before my second surgery I was actually 

1573
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,030
training for Delta Force.

1574
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:05,460
I was,
I wanted to go to Delta and I was 

1575
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:09,261
rocking recruiting a lot and before my 
second truck running and you're running 

1576
01:14:09,261 --> 01:14:13,731
with a pack,
a pack on my back with some way on how 

1577
01:14:13,731 --> 01:14:13,731
heavy the pack,
50,

1578
01:14:13,731 --> 01:14:13,960
60 pounds.
And you run with that on.

1579
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:17,170
Well you're supposed to hike or hump 
like rock hopping,

1580
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:19,220
right?
I ran with it because.

1581
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,230
Because,
you know,

1582
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,190
that's what I did.
Right?

1583
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:26,080
So the day before,
the day of the day of heart surgery,

1584
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:31,650
I did a ruck run because I knew I was 
going to be out of commission for 

1585
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:33,520
Awhile.
So fuck it.

1586
01:14:33,521 --> 01:14:34,780
Matter get my last one in,
dude.

1587
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,940
Jesus Christ.
So I could do.

1588
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:39,250
I have had my training log.
So after my second heart surgery,

1589
01:14:39,251 --> 01:14:42,130
all I could do was walk.
So I became an ultra walker,

1590
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:48,240
walked my fucking ass off and I over a 
period of time it took a year for that 

1591
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:48,640
thing to heal up the hill.

1592
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:54,380
You know my first bubble study after my 
second heart surgery came back negative 

1593
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,990
or positive,
the bubble went through again.

1594
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:58,330
Oh No.
And they're going to crack me open.

1595
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:00,340
Oh Man.
Over that period of time,

1596
01:15:00,341 --> 01:15:02,260
my heart healed around that thing 
nicely.

1597
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:07,700
And I passed the second bubble tests.
So the first bubble test was how long 

1598
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:07,700
after a year?
It was.

1599
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,580
So the first bubble tests after the 
first surgery,

1600
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:14,990
six months.
And then you had to go through a full 

1601
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:16,350
six months after that totally heal.
Then you have the second heart surgery.

1602
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,090
And when does the bubble test fail?
After the second heart surgery,

1603
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,370
it was about six months,
Jesus Christ,

1604
01:15:21,371 --> 01:15:22,900
and they said,
and the doctor looked at me and said,

1605
01:15:22,901 --> 01:15:27,901
you know,
I'm sorry to inform him that we get the 

1606
01:15:27,901 --> 01:15:27,901
crack your chest open the next time 
they're really getting there.

1607
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,000
So I sat back thinking this could be a 
third heart surgery,

1608
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:33,310
and then,
um,

1609
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,370
that one,
they said we have to wait for six months

1610
01:15:36,371 --> 01:15:38,480
to see if this thing's gonna close up.
Right?

1611
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:40,010
And I came back thinking,
man,

1612
01:15:40,011 --> 01:15:44,980
I'm about to get cracked the fuck open.
And that bubble got pinned up,

1613
01:15:44,981 --> 01:15:46,210
man.
They go through,

1614
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:51,240
maybe forced it through with your mind 
and visualize and that's it,

1615
01:15:52,091 --> 01:15:53,500
man.
That's something to visualize.

1616
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,120
Holy Shit,
man,

1617
01:15:55,121 --> 01:15:57,040
that is crazy.
It's crazy.

1618
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:59,110
One on a ruck run with a hole in your 
heart to.

1619
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:00,820
I did it for several years.
I said,

1620
01:16:00,821 --> 01:16:02,590
fuck it.
I might as well keep on going,

1621
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:02,860
man.

1622
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:07,810
That's amazing.
Now after all said and done,

1623
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:09,310
everything's good now.
Yeah,

1624
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:10,000
everything.
I mean,

1625
01:16:10,001 --> 01:16:12,550
I'm sure it must have popped up in my 
fucking ass and not to do that.

1626
01:16:12,551 --> 01:16:14,440
You know,
everything's good right now.

1627
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:19,890
I'm always waiting for the next thing to
pop up and I handled the same way I was 

1628
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:19,890
attacking,
but yeah,

1629
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:19,890
as of right now,
I'm in the best shape.

1630
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:23,140
My 43 years old just turned 43 February 
17th.

1631
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:28,000
I am in the best shape of my life.
I'm not knocking on wood because life.

1632
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:29,710
Fuck it.
Life comes at you dude.

1633
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,150
Fuck.
Knocking on wood.

1634
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:32,440
Come at me.
I mean,

1635
01:16:32,441 --> 01:16:35,950
I would think that you would be a go to 
guy for injuries.

1636
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,460
Like if anybody's ball game.
I've had them all.

1637
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,340
I've had.
When you broke the world record for Chin

1638
01:16:42,341 --> 01:16:43,810
ups,
then you rip your arm apart.

1639
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:44,470
Pull ups.
Yeah.

1640
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:46,900
So if you pull up the picture,
there's a picture of my hand.

1641
01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:51,901
You'll see.
I'll know what is the pull ups or pull 

1642
01:16:51,901 --> 01:16:55,471
ups or here.
Hands our hands out and chin ups or 

1643
01:16:55,471 --> 01:16:55,950
hands four hands forward.
So I failed three times.

1644
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:58,750
I failed twice before I finally got it 
the third time.

1645
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,270
And um,
I,

1646
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:03,100
the first time I rip the shit out of my 
forearm.

1647
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:08,620
And then the second time you'll see 
there's a picture of my hand.

1648
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,350
And it is a third degree burn.
So that's my hand.

1649
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:14,480
Oh Jesus,
man,

1650
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:17,570
what in the fuck is going to look at you
a bit by a wolf.

1651
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,460
So what's funny about that,
as you see that,

1652
01:17:19,461 --> 01:17:22,070
uh,
that doesn't create after one pull up.

1653
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:24,310
So if you can imagine the pain of 
[inaudible],

1654
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:29,390
you know,
you have one contact point I said like 

1655
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:29,490
running,
you can overcome it because he,

1656
01:17:29,491 --> 01:17:30,740
this big giant legs.

1657
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:35,740
And it's,
it's different when you have these 

1658
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:36,740
little fragile punk ass hands touching 
the bar.

1659
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:39,830
Imagine 4,030
pull ups.

1660
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:44,831
How many times you're coming on that bar
coming off now at 207 pounds at the 

1661
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,550
time.
So I was,

1662
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:48,350
I was a bigger guy.
I'm like one 95 or 95 now.

1663
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:53,060
So I was almost 22 pounds heavier.
So that was a lot bigger than I am right

1664
01:17:53,061 --> 01:17:53,600
there.
Bam.

1665
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:58,630
You would prefer get that shit man.
So you were doing it in sets of five 

1666
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:00,120
testify.
So as you see,

1667
01:18:00,121 --> 01:18:02,960
you have these different people who are 
witnessing you,

1668
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:04,550
you have to have your,
your,

1669
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,350
your number there to make sure that 
you're,

1670
01:18:06,351 --> 01:18:07,790
um,
you know,

1671
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,840
qualify for the guest.
A world's record.

1672
01:18:09,841 --> 01:18:13,910
That's 1415.
I have a long way to governor the 4,015

1673
01:18:13,911 --> 01:18:16,820
pull ups to go.
She's so.

1674
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:18,410
Yeah.
And how long did you do this?

1675
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:19,970
Over 24 hours.
It was seven.

1676
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:22,340
So I broke it up 17.
Wow.

1677
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:27,370
And I was fucking over it.
What did it feel like in the last chin 

1678
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:28,070
up?
You know what?

1679
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,590
Actually there's a video that we have 
and um,

1680
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:33,410
I was chasing this guy named Steven 
Highland.

1681
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:39,340
So this guy named Steven Holl had the 
record and the video is my last three 

1682
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:43,691
posts for a broken record.
I'm talking so much shit to this 

1683
01:18:43,691 --> 01:18:43,691
motherfucker.
I'm like,

1684
01:18:43,691 --> 01:18:47,801
Hey,
motherfucker thought I wasn't gonna get 

1685
01:18:47,801 --> 01:18:47,801
it.
Huh?

1686
01:18:47,801 --> 01:18:47,801
I told you bitch ass mother fucker.
I'm coming after you.

1687
01:18:47,801 --> 01:18:49,960
I'm here now.
It's just me talking shit.

1688
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:51,810
It's a cool video.
But I felt um,

1689
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,980
I felt nothing.
I was just happy I have to do anymore.

1690
01:18:55,010 --> 01:19:00,010
I just 67,000
pullups in nine months is training 

1691
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:03,440
record for 40,000
and the failures,

1692
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:07,150
so I did the first time in September.
Failed miserably.

1693
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:09,890
I was the day showed the 2,588
or something like that.

1694
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,400
Failed miserably for millions of people 
too much later.

1695
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,590
November.
Tried again,

1696
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:21,100
failed again.
Two months later in January 19th I 

1697
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,240
finally fucking got it.
So after I got it,

1698
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:28,241
it wasn't like I'm happy.
It was like I ain't got to more fucking 

1699
01:19:28,241 --> 01:19:31,721
pull ups anymore.
Roger that saw it was a fucking check 

1700
01:19:31,721 --> 01:19:35,441
that have picked off man.
But you were doing them when I got here 

1701
01:19:35,441 --> 01:19:35,441
today.
You know why?

1702
01:19:35,441 --> 01:19:36,370
Because now it's a part of me,
dude,

1703
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:42,080
man,
I don't like doing it so we got to get 

1704
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,420
some knocks him out.
You don't like doing them so you gotta 

1705
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:44,420
do it.
That's my whole life isn't like someone.

1706
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:47,540
Someone gets drunk at a certain whiskey.
Like if they smell it,

1707
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:52,541
they'll get disgusted.
Like it's like yeager mice or something 

1708
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:52,541
like that.
They smell it.

1709
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:53,850
Right?
Is that what it's like with you?

1710
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,400
With,
with a lot of ups?

1711
01:19:55,550 --> 01:20:00,550
With a lot of things,
lot of things I don't like running on 

1712
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:00,550
like,
and people don't believe it,

1713
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:00,550
but you know,
I was,

1714
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:05,360
I was a big guy twice in my life,
so hence the reason why I just don't 

1715
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:06,320
like running,
man.

1716
01:20:06,321 --> 01:20:07,100
It hurts.
It's brutal.

1717
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:12,170
Sucks going out and I'm going to be gone
for two hours or I am going to be gone 

1718
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:15,600
39 hours running a one mile track.
Fuck,

1719
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:16,740
I'm not crazy,
man.

1720
01:20:16,741 --> 01:20:18,220
This sucks.
I mean,

1721
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:23,300
you know,
people put me in this category of you 

1722
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:23,340
must be some crazy guy who loves it.
Nah Man.

1723
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,230
Nah.
That's why I do it though.

1724
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,250
That's the only way to couch your 
fucking brain man.

1725
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,650
One way to get hard and like people take
these classes on mental toughness.

1726
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:33,180
Like even sales.
You have the class about visualization,

1727
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,770
self talk,
eat an elephant.

1728
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:36,180
One bite at a time.
Breathing control.

1729
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:37,290
Yeah.
Roger,

1730
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:40,650
that you got to put yourself in her lacy
situation.

1731
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:44,070
It's a lifestyle.
How are you going to react?

1732
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:49,550
How are you going to react to it?
Like all that training goes out the 

1733
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:51,891
fucking door when you're in the fucking 
cold water and you're fucking miserable 

1734
01:20:51,891 --> 01:20:56,330
as the first hour of a her and 30 hours 
of hell week in that first wave goes 

1735
01:20:56,330 --> 01:21:00,351
over your head and you're the curtis,
you've been in your life and your mind 

1736
01:21:00,351 --> 01:21:00,900
goes from our one hour,
one fucking 30.

1737
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:03,510
Oh,
that fucking self talking shit dude.

1738
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:05,970
You Ain't thinking about getting the 
fuck out of here.

1739
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:11,210
But if you live this shit on a daily 
basis and know how to calm your mind 

1740
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:13,350
down to self talk will help.
All that stuff will help.

1741
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:16,410
But usually we react.
We have pain,

1742
01:21:16,411 --> 01:21:19,350
we have suffered,
we react and we react about get the fuck

1743
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,220
outta here.

1744
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:25,700
We gotta go.
It's those people were able to control 

1745
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:26,280
that fucking feeling of fucking flight 
and say,

1746
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:27,000
Nah,
motherfucker.

1747
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:30,570
There's a way through this.
It's not going to be here forever.

1748
01:21:30,571 --> 01:21:33,030
I'm not cold right now.
I went through three of them.

1749
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,940
I'm not coding now.
I'm in a nice warm studio with you.

1750
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:38,550
You've got to think about that shit.
It's just gonna end.

1751
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,470
It's gonna end,
but we don't know that.

1752
01:21:40,471 --> 01:21:45,471
We don't think that at that time it 
could last forever and then you get to 

1753
01:21:45,471 --> 01:21:45,471
sit back on Friday.
Everybody walking across the,

1754
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:47,580
you know,
back on the grinder,

1755
01:21:47,581 --> 01:21:48,780
all the 16,
17,

1756
01:21:48,781 --> 01:21:53,781
18 guys that graduated hell week and you
get a chance to watch these guys 

1757
01:21:53,781 --> 01:21:57,291
victorious,
and then you get the chance to think 

1758
01:21:57,291 --> 01:21:57,291
about that.
You take that hot,

1759
01:21:57,291 --> 01:21:58,090
warm shower,
first name chemistry,

1760
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,670
your fucking minds.
Why the fuck did I quit?

1761
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:03,210
So what keeps me going?
I've quit several things.

1762
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,060
I know what's on the back end,
the fucking quitting.

1763
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,900
It's a lifetime of thinking about why 
the fuck did I do that?

1764
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,150
No,
I ain't fucking doing that.

1765
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:18,310
There's something about talking to a guy
like you that a lot of people hope that 

1766
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:21,620
you're going to say some magic thing 
that's going to click in their brain.

1767
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:23,720
Everybody gets changed who they are,
like,

1768
01:22:23,721 --> 01:22:24,860
what is it?
What is the thing?

1769
01:22:24,861 --> 01:22:29,861
That's why people go to these self help 
conferences and they take these classes 

1770
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:35,690
and they hope that someone's going to 
say something that changes the way their

1771
01:22:35,691 --> 01:22:37,430
mind works.
It's hilarious to me.

1772
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:39,470
It is,
it's kind of Larry's to me too.

1773
01:22:39,471 --> 01:22:44,471
But what is also hilarious is that what 
you're saying is that you have to do 

1774
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:48,320
those things.
You have to suffer,

1775
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:51,170
you have to live in it,
you have to be comfortable in it.

1776
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:56,030
And then maybe some of that shit will 
help you a little bit along the way

1777
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:58,610
period.
And I went to,

1778
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,740
I was a,
when I was a recruiter,

1779
01:23:00,741 --> 01:23:03,980
I got invited to mit smart ass 
motherfuckers there,

1780
01:23:03,981 --> 01:23:04,940
man,
I'm not that.

1781
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:10,210
I'm dumb and knuckle dragger and um,
there was this guy there,

1782
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:13,270
I forget his name,
but he was like the top head head guy,

1783
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,250
old white guy,
you know,

1784
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:18,460
all,
all genius out and we were on this panel

1785
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:21,850
and they were asking us all these 
questions about the mind,

1786
01:23:21,851 --> 01:23:26,851
mental toughness and shit.
And he was answering them and I wasn't 

1787
01:23:26,851 --> 01:23:27,640
answering any questions and I'll never 
forget he was just answering them off of

1788
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:30,670
theory.
He never put his fucking ass and shit.

1789
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,000
You read a bunch of fucking books and 
you think that you know how to fucking 

1790
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,271
mind works and shit.
I had gone through hill to a kid and 

1791
01:23:39,271 --> 01:23:39,680
then all the way up until now.
Right.

1792
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,750
So I know.

1793
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:44,440
So that theory is bullshit.
Yeah,

1794
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:46,780
there's a lot of good stuff out there 
you can read from people,

1795
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:51,250
but I had lived hill and when you put 
yourself in hill,

1796
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:56,700
that's the only time you can figure out 
how to fuck to get through that 

1797
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:56,700
motherfucker.
You can't.

1798
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:59,930
You can't read somebody else's book 
about some theory on how to do shit.

1799
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:04,960
Some guy who set up and they're a nice 
warm office and read it and wrote some 

1800
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:05,800
book with a Nice Cup of coffee in the 
fucking hair.

1801
01:24:05,801 --> 01:24:10,801
No,
I want to see that guy who put immersed 

1802
01:24:10,801 --> 01:24:15,151
himself in fucking hell.
And he thought about quitting and 

1803
01:24:15,151 --> 01:24:15,820
leaving and him and his wife and his 
kids.

1804
01:24:15,821 --> 01:24:16,970
And why am I here?
Is this,

1805
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:21,790
is it worth it?
All this crazy shit is still said it.

1806
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:26,070
Found out a way to get through it.
So basically that's,

1807
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:27,700
that's the bottom line of it all.

1808
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:31,780
We all want to read about how we can 
quickly get somewhere.

1809
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,000
That's why there's six minute abs and 
all this other shit.

1810
01:24:34,001 --> 01:24:37,960
So powerful.
Did you make it some results from it,

1811
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:42,990
but they're not permanent.
The permanent result comes from you 

1812
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:43,570
fucking.
I say it all the time.

1813
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:48,750
You have to suffer.
You have to make that a tattoo on your 

1814
01:24:49,361 --> 01:24:52,630
fucking brain.
So when that time comes again,

1815
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:56,740
you don't forget it.
You may forget it for a second,

1816
01:24:56,741 --> 01:24:58,570
but you can go back in the cookie jar.
I call it.

1817
01:24:58,571 --> 01:25:01,480
It's a.
it's something that we've all endured.

1818
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,780
I call it the cookie jar and we often 
forget how hard we are,

1819
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,970
but you got to reflect back to a couple 
of seconds.

1820
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:08,230
Reflect.
I've been through this,

1821
01:25:08,231 --> 01:25:13,231
I've been through that,
and then remind yourself I'm a bad 

1822
01:25:13,231 --> 01:25:14,380
motherfucker and then you can get 
through that shit,

1823
01:25:14,381 --> 01:25:17,500
but if you don't believe it even endorse
shit.

1824
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:21,180
You're just blowing smoke man and you're
not going to get through anything.

1825
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:22,690
What was this guy saying like,
well,

1826
01:25:22,691 --> 01:25:24,340
what was his theories that he was thrown
out?

1827
01:25:24,341 --> 01:25:26,860
There is theories was about,
I forget exactly what it was.

1828
01:25:26,861 --> 01:25:31,861
Was it something about what the mind 
does under stress and how we can't.

1829
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:36,880
He said how we can't do something and I 
did it.

1830
01:25:37,690 --> 01:25:39,410
I did what he said we couldn't do.
Like,

1831
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:42,880
what was he saying he couldn't do.
It was something about if you're born,

1832
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:47,230
if you're born a certain way,
if somebody,

1833
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:51,190
if you're born a certain way,
you can't become this way.

1834
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:57,160
It was totally saying that who I am now,
like I had to be born with some genetic 

1835
01:25:58,781 --> 01:26:01,690
power or some,
some gift from God,

1836
01:26:01,691 --> 01:26:05,340
but I had to have some kind of special,
had had some kind of special gift.

1837
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:10,370
I forget what set me off,
but it was that we had to be to be 

1838
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:11,210
somewhere you had a baby born with.

1839
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:16,210
It was a concept and I know what I was 
born with and I know the battle that I 

1840
01:26:17,901 --> 01:26:20,330
had in my mind.
So when he said it,

1841
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,330
I sat there looking at my face and some 
of the crowd asked me a question.

1842
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,690
I totally contradicted everything he 
said and I was like,

1843
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:27,800
Nah man.
I mean,

1844
01:26:27,810 --> 01:26:32,810
I know for a fact that you can be this 
fucked up dude like really fucked up 

1845
01:26:35,061 --> 01:26:39,190
dude and with the right mindset and 
it's.

1846
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:44,360
It sounds so easy with the right mindset
doesn't sound easy to know what you're 

1847
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,740
saying.
It sounds very simplistic answer,

1848
01:26:45,741 --> 01:26:47,330
right?
You can.

1849
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:52,900
You can,
but you have to go into a dark chambers 

1850
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:53,870
that we often shut off and you got to 
open them up.

1851
01:26:53,871 --> 01:26:56,570
You get to open up and fight that 
fucking demon getting there.

1852
01:26:56,571 --> 01:26:58,190
Talk to that motherfucker and say,
what's up?

1853
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:04,060
And we often take the.
We all like to take this four lane 

1854
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:06,200
highway.
The easy highway has has fucking signs.

1855
01:27:06,201 --> 01:27:09,290
It has restaurants.
We all loved that four lane highway.

1856
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:14,560
We always step over the shovel and all I
did was I picked up that fucking shovel 

1857
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:19,900
and shovel.
I made my own path and you may have big 

1858
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:23,051
boulders and shit.
They may be getting towards your miles 

1859
01:27:23,051 --> 01:27:23,810
up the road faster than you,
but going through this path of life,

1860
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:26,060
this journey over here that you make 
yourself,

1861
01:27:26,061 --> 01:27:29,360
that's incredibly difficult,
but comes out.

1862
01:27:29,361 --> 01:27:34,361
The other end of that motherfucker is 
some glorious shit that you can't even 

1863
01:27:34,361 --> 01:27:37,130
explain to people and we're afraid.
Bottom line is most of us,

1864
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,930
even the people who have all these 
theories and shit,

1865
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:43,700
it's easier to accept the fact that I'm 
just not good enough.

1866
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:46,640
I wasn't made to do that,
and yes,

1867
01:27:46,641 --> 01:27:50,330
some of us can't be Lebron James,
but I'll tell you right now,

1868
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:52,340
man,
we can do a lot of shit when it comes to

1869
01:27:52,341 --> 01:27:55,220
this pure arm guts and willpower and 
getting through shit.

1870
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,870
We have a lot more with a lot more than 
we think we have the other

1871
01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:01,000
album with a guy like that,
with his theories.

1872
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:06,020
His theories are based on results and 
those results are based on human beings 

1873
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:09,701
and most human beings.
There are certain people that are born 

1874
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:09,701
with certain gifts,
like a guy like Lebron James,

1875
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:13,100
obvious physical talent.
You Know Jon Jones and mma.

1876
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,410
Obviously physical talent,
but there's.

1877
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,360
When you look at someone who's super 
successful,

1878
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:25,480
you always assume that it has to be 
because of some sort of physical gifts 

1879
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,760
because people look at themselves and 
I'm sure this doctor,

1880
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:31,990
this old dude probably had like a little
gut and probably says exactly.

1881
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,260
I looked a little tiny arms,
weak shoulders and probably thought,

1882
01:28:36,261 --> 01:28:41,261
well,
there are certain people that are just 

1883
01:28:41,261 --> 01:28:41,261
Meza morphic and probably broke it down 
all the scientific terms,

1884
01:28:41,261 --> 01:28:41,330
you know,
they,

1885
01:28:41,331 --> 01:28:46,331
they,
they just have a fast twitch muscle 

1886
01:28:46,331 --> 01:28:48,611
fibers and they'll say all this crazy 
shit that is true at the very highest 

1887
01:28:48,611 --> 01:28:50,360
levels of the winners.
Right?

1888
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:52,280
But it doesn't mean that you can't 
become that.

1889
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:57,370
No,
it just means that it's too painful for 

1890
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:57,410
most people to go through.
So very few people ever get there.

1891
01:28:57,411 --> 01:29:00,170
So if you look at the actual results,
he would be correct,

1892
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:01,860
but he's not correct

1893
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,350
because he doesn't take the shovel.
Exactly.

1894
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:08,700
That's the moral of the story,
does not some easy lit up street lights,

1895
01:29:08,701 --> 01:29:11,460
wrath with nice smooth roads,
right?

1896
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:14,910
It's a difficult motherfucker where 
you're going to fail and you're going to

1897
01:29:14,911 --> 01:29:19,911
be in your head.
You can be saying I'm not good enough 

1898
01:29:19,911 --> 01:29:22,590
and it's how you get through that is how
you get through that on a daily basis.

1899
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:25,980
When that thing is st man,
I'm 43.

1900
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,010
I've done so much.
You start to become civilized.

1901
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:33,330
The refrigerator gets full.
You start making money and you start.

1902
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:38,760
I'm not getting cold anymore.
I'm retired once in at 40 people.

1903
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:41,570
Shouldn't it be playing basketball or 
football or or,

1904
01:29:41,571 --> 01:29:46,571
or being.
You start to believe this shit and it 

1905
01:29:46,571 --> 01:29:49,851
becomes in your fucking mind like 
there's people who are retiring at 47 

1906
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:50,800
years old or 30 something years old at 
43,

1907
01:29:50,801 --> 01:29:55,770
I'm still putting in hundred mile weeks,
still doing thousands of pullups pushups

1908
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:59,070
because I'm not allowing myself to 
become civilized.

1909
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,170
The worst that can happen to a man's 
become civilized.

1910
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,450
You lose that fucking fight you,
you,

1911
01:30:03,451 --> 01:30:03,750
you,
you,

1912
01:30:03,751 --> 01:30:06,450
you lose that.
Why the fuck am I doing this shit?

1913
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:09,300
I'm good.
You Ain't good man.

1914
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,780
You ain't never fucking arrived and 
that's just my mentality.

1915
01:30:12,781 --> 01:30:15,050
You may have more,
but you'd never fucking arrived.

1916
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:17,280
You want to be uncommon.
I must uncommon people,

1917
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,570
period.
Uncommon amongst uncommon peoples.

1918
01:30:21,571 --> 01:30:23,640
One of the greatest ways to put it,
that's it.

1919
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:24,810
Like if you're the.
If,

1920
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,160
if,
if you're like,

1921
01:30:26,161 --> 01:30:31,161
for me,
what got me in trouble with the navy 

1922
01:30:31,161 --> 01:30:32,040
seals is I wanted to be one so bad,
so bad.

1923
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:34,980
I fought my ass off and I saw them as 
uncommon.

1924
01:30:34,981 --> 01:30:36,780
People.
Very uncommon.

1925
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:40,020
But once you become a navy seal,
you all navy seal.

1926
01:30:40,030 --> 01:30:41,530
So guess what happens?
Your fucking common.

1927
01:30:41,531 --> 01:30:46,531
Again,
I wanted to be uncommon and months 

1928
01:30:46,531 --> 01:30:46,800
uncommon people.

1929
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,930
I want it to be the guy.
I don't care if you fucking light.

1930
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:51,000
Okay?
If you don't understand me,

1931
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:53,550
I didn't give a fuck.
Once I went through this fucking journey

1932
01:30:53,551 --> 01:30:58,551
and path of life,
you ain't got to enter a whole bunch of 

1933
01:30:58,551 --> 01:30:58,770
fucking guys that don't fucking like me.
I don't give a fuck.

1934
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,280
I'm a warrior period.
There's a lot of guys are spending a lot

1935
01:31:02,281 --> 01:31:07,281
more combat than me.
A warrior's not always at words that 

1936
01:31:07,281 --> 01:31:08,160
mother fucker.
He says,

1937
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:10,020
Hey,
I'm here again today.

1938
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:12,930
I'm here again.
Tomorrow going to be here the next day.

1939
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,300
I'm 50 years old.
I'm still fucking getting after it.

1940
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:20,690
It's a person that puts no fucking limit
on west possible and that's what got me 

1941
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:25,221
in trouble a lot.
That's why I went to ranger school as a 

1942
01:31:25,221 --> 01:31:25,221
seal.
That's what I tried to go to Delta force

1943
01:31:25,221 --> 01:31:25,221
twice.
You know I,

1944
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:30,710
I've been,
I've been through all these different 

1945
01:31:30,710 --> 01:31:32,241
training programs because I was looking 
for in the military where I say all is 

1946
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:33,330
in the training.

1947
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:37,080
These people get their ass handed to 
them after they get out.

1948
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:42,110
A lot of them get civilized.
I always wanted to go back into 

1949
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:43,010
training.
Am I?

1950
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:48,030
We're always that.
I wanted to go back to war and the war 

1951
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:48,030
was in that training program where you 
see guys,

1952
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:52,911
you can quit.
Guys who are brutal guys who are 

1953
01:31:52,911 --> 01:31:52,911
suffering,
guys who are.

1954
01:31:52,911 --> 01:31:56,150
You Go.
So as a ceo you don't volunteer for 

1955
01:31:56,150 --> 01:31:56,150
ranger school.
I did.

1956
01:31:56,150 --> 01:31:57,060
I put in seven chips,
got turned down by eighth grade.

1957
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,860
I got accepted.
I went at 28,

1958
01:31:59,861 --> 01:32:03,460
29 years old and they go,
why don't you go?

1959
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:07,360
Because I started becoming civilized.
I started becoming complacent.

1960
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:12,760
I,
I needed to get my fucking ass kicked 

1961
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,151
again.
And when you go as a seal going down to 

1962
01:32:15,151 --> 01:32:15,460
you have no rank and ranger school,
you can be a major.

1963
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:20,080
You just fucking Joe Brown,
you're nobody and you're not eating,

1964
01:32:20,081 --> 01:32:20,800
you're not sleeping.

1965
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:25,800
So I always would put myself.
I really immerse myself and shit like 

1966
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:29,161
that.
Even our climb the ladder and I 

1967
01:32:29,161 --> 01:32:29,360
intentionally fall back down that 
motherfucker.

1968
01:32:29,361 --> 01:32:30,070
They said,
all right man,

1969
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:32,950
getting soft dude,
getting soft.

1970
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:35,920
Kick your fucking ass again.
And I,

1971
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,480
you know,
it's kind of the process.

1972
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:42,510
Did you find resistance from that 
amongst other guys that didn't like to 

1973
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:47,101
make the.
You were making them uncomfortable 

1974
01:32:47,101 --> 01:32:48,871
because that is something that people.
There's a natural instinct that people 

1975
01:32:48,871 --> 01:32:52,621
have when someone's working harder than 
them to somehow another diminish that 

1976
01:32:52,621 --> 01:32:52,621
person.
Well,

1977
01:32:52,621 --> 01:32:56,080
I know that a lot of guys don't mind me 
for a lot of reasons and I realized that

1978
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:58,810
I am a guy that doesn't care if you 
liked me or not.

1979
01:32:59,290 --> 01:33:04,290
And when you're an Alpha male and you're
against other offer males and we eat our

1980
01:33:04,361 --> 01:33:06,490
own alpha males eat their own.

1981
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,120
And I loved that shit is fucking gold 
man.

1982
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:11,470
I want to eat.
Hey Man,

1983
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:15,190
I'm all about that kind of mentality,
but I would sometimes take it to another

1984
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:18,520
level and I wasn't part of a of a good 
old boy network.

1985
01:33:18,521 --> 01:33:21,610
I didn't want to be part.
I wanted to be David fucking goggins for

1986
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:25,090
too long in my life.
It got me in trouble for two on my left.

1987
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:27,550
I wanted to be accepted.
Growing up.

1988
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:29,860
I lied.
I fucking did what I could for.

1989
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,340
If you fucking like UFC and identity.
I love it.

1990
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:38,940
I love it man.
Let's go fucking watch them and be my 

1991
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:38,940
friend.
Be My buddy.

1992
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:41,350
That fucking weak ass shit.
I found out through this path of life.

1993
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:46,170
Who is David Goggins?
Who am I to go through all?

1994
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:51,240
I did it alone.
There was no fucking trophy on the 

1995
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:51,240
fucking wall.

1996
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:51,730
The mantle that trophies in my fucking 
brain.

1997
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,430
No one helped me get to know me.
Pay My fucking bills.

1998
01:33:54,431 --> 01:33:55,180
No,
I did shit for me.

1999
01:33:55,360 --> 01:34:00,360
No one random.
His fucking mouth was that fucking wait 

2000
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,830
when I suffered on my own and develop 
this man who said to I man,

2001
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:04,660
a very competitive,
ultra competitive.

2002
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:06,850
Do that taking what you want,
man.

2003
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:12,300
I call that personal sovereignty.
Exactly what not a lot of people that 

2004
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:16,050
have asked me and there's a lot of 
people that change who they are 

2005
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:18,050
depending upon what people want from 
them and that's.

2006
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:19,150
That's me.
Yeah,

2007
01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:24,330
that's important man.
And most people struggled their whole 

2008
01:34:24,330 --> 01:34:24,850
life to find out who they are,
struggled their whole,

2009
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,190
their whole life.
To find out what defines them,

2010
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:28,900
what they actually enjoy and what they 
don't.

2011
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,470
You start putting yourself in situations
that suck your find yourself.

2012
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:33,340
Yeah.

2013
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:35,200
You'll find out real quick.
That is the thing,

2014
01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:40,201
right?
And that's one of the things that I've 

2015
01:34:40,201 --> 01:34:40,710
gotten from paying attention to you,
is that you,

2016
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:45,750
what you're preaching,
what you're talking about is finding 

2017
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:45,750
yourself through struggle.
It's it,

2018
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:47,920
it's the only way to find yourself.
You don't find yourself.

2019
01:34:47,950 --> 01:34:50,560
If you'd like bench pressing and you 
bench press all the fucking time.

2020
01:34:50,561 --> 01:34:53,140
What are you finding out?
If you'd like to swim,

2021
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,260
that's all you want to do is swim.
What are you finding out?

2022
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:02,520
Put that you know people always are 
people talking about tripled down on 

2023
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:05,561
your fucking strikes.
That's the fucking weak ass shit in the 

2024
01:35:05,561 --> 01:35:06,950
world now tripled down on your fucking 
weaknesses.

2025
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,220
Found out something about yourself.
You know the the good shit.

2026
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:13,370
You know the happy shit.
That's why my on my facebook page.

2027
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:15,530
Why don't you talk about good times?

2028
01:35:15,890 --> 01:35:17,540
You know how to get to that shit 
motherfucker.

2029
01:35:19,290 --> 01:35:20,920
You don't need a fucking year.
You don't need.

2030
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:22,400
Want to tell you how to get through.
It's happy.

2031
01:35:22,770 --> 01:35:23,630
That's easy.
Shit.

2032
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:29,230
I,
I would tell you how you can help 

2033
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:29,510
yourself get through the times that suck
real life.

2034
01:35:30,010 --> 01:35:32,780
This is real life.
Ninety percent of your life will suck.

2035
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:39,100
Ten percent will be fucking happy.
You may be lucky guy and have a lot of 

2036
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:39,250
fucking money.
Have a great ass woman.

2037
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:44,260
All this shit.
Trust me one on one with that fucking 

2038
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:47,201
guy.
He's missing something because life 

2039
01:35:47,201 --> 01:35:49,551
still sucks that he hasn't faced 
something that bothered him his whole 

2040
01:35:49,551 --> 01:35:52,481
fucking life.
Some is still eating that motherfucker 

2041
01:35:52,481 --> 01:35:52,481
up.
Almost everybody.

2042
01:35:52,481 --> 01:35:56,630
Everybody eating you the fuck up,
but maybe you found a good way how I did

2043
01:35:56,631 --> 01:36:01,631
growing up on how they ignore that voice
that's saying you ain't facing some 

2044
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:03,020
shit.
Period,

2045
01:36:03,021 --> 01:36:04,430
man.
I'm not special.

2046
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:05,660
I just stopped listing.
I.

2047
01:36:05,661 --> 01:36:10,070
I listened to that voice.
It's why I talk so fucking aggressive.

2048
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:10,970
People said,
man,

2049
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:12,770
do you believe in God your customer 
much.

2050
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:19,120
When I say fuck it,
it's letting you know what I'm thinking.

2051
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:22,940
If I try to make it all pretty and shit,
that's not what my life was.

2052
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:28,720
It was a violent,
violent struggle daily to get where I'm 

2053
01:36:28,761 --> 01:36:31,040
at today.
I'm not gonna water down.

2054
01:36:31,450 --> 01:36:33,140
Knock a water down.
Shit wasn't fun.

2055
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:36,320
It ain't fun today,
but I'm happy.

2056
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:42,400
Don't you think that your happiness is 
probably elevated by the amount of pain 

2057
01:36:44,361 --> 01:36:45,980
that you've gone through?
One hundred percent.

2058
01:36:45,981 --> 01:36:48,200
So the amount of suffering that you 
understand,

2059
01:36:48,201 --> 01:36:53,201
the amount of pain that you've gone 
through makes you appreciate the 

2060
01:36:53,201 --> 01:36:55,370
happiness and the beautiful moments with
much more intensity.

2061
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:58,440
That's what people miss about my story 
week.

2062
01:36:58,460 --> 01:36:59,290
People hear this

2063
01:36:59,610 --> 01:37:00,380
kid,
I'm a god.

2064
01:37:00,381 --> 01:37:01,770
He must be miserable.
Oh my God,

2065
01:37:01,771 --> 01:37:04,680
what the Hell is wrong with them?
You're missing the fucking story.

2066
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:07,170
You're not listening to the story,
man.

2067
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:11,070
Look what I overcame.
If that is,

2068
01:37:11,071 --> 01:37:13,530
uh,
put some badge of honor tattooed in your

2069
01:37:13,531 --> 01:37:17,490
fucking brain for the rest of your life.
You can die today talking to Joe Rogan.

2070
01:37:18,510 --> 01:37:20,010
You're missing the story,
man.

2071
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:22,530
Am I happy?
What the fuck do you think?

2072
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:25,380
Don't miss it.
Don't misunderstand the passion in which

2073
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:29,880
I speak for not being intensely happy,
happiest person in the world,

2074
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:34,080
but I'm not done so I'm not gonna.
Speak to you like,

2075
01:37:34,110 --> 01:37:35,460
Oh man,
everything is great.

2076
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:37,650
No,
I have a lot more shit to do.

2077
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:39,420
A lot more shit to do.

2078
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:42,130
Well,
this is in the same use of the word that

2079
01:37:42,131 --> 01:37:45,400
you used the warrior's mentality,
the warriors life,

2080
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:46,750
right?
This is.

2081
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:51,860
This is the way that you can keep 
balanced and sane and keep a good grip 

2082
01:37:53,441 --> 01:37:54,940
on who you are.
Period.

2083
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,000
And like there's

2084
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,870
a quote that was said.
I don't know who said it.

2085
01:37:57,910 --> 01:38:00,270
It was a great quote.
This guy said,

2086
01:38:00,271 --> 01:38:05,271
I'm going into combat going into war of 
the 100 men that go into war tensioning 

2087
01:38:06,601 --> 01:38:09,930
fucking be there.
80 of them are just targets.

2088
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:15,500
10 do most or nine do most of fighting.
One is a warrior and it's a true quote 

2089
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:21,390
to life.
I saw it going through train.

2090
01:38:21,391 --> 01:38:26,391
I saw it everywhere I went.
There's so many people who just show up 

2091
01:38:26,391 --> 01:38:30,120
to life that shouldn't even fucking be 
around and there's few people do all the

2092
01:38:30,121 --> 01:38:31,890
work.
I wanted to be part of that nine.

2093
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:37,470
I'm working towards being that one and 
that's just how I live my life now.

2094
01:38:37,471 --> 01:38:39,180
What are you doing with your life these 
days?

2095
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:42,630
Right now I keep the same.
I'm very routine.

2096
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:44,520
I get up every morning,
I run,

2097
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,730
I go to the gym and then at nighttime I 
stretch out.

2098
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:53,330
I am.
I'm just trying to develop a business 

2099
01:38:53,330 --> 01:38:53,330
costing me a lot of money trying to do 
that.

2100
01:38:53,330 --> 01:38:54,720
I'm just getting out.
I'm A.

2101
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:58,050
I'm an introvert,
so I never want to get on social media.

2102
01:38:58,180 --> 01:39:03,150
I'm not big on that.
I'm big on being with yourself.

2103
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:07,410
I believe all these fucking cameras and 
phones and shit,

2104
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:10,590
it takes you away from the most powerful
thing in the world,

2105
01:39:10,591 --> 01:39:14,610
which is your fucking mind.
So I try hard to continue to grow that.

2106
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:18,480
I'm trying to break a record again.
I'm trying to cross death valley as fast

2107
01:39:18,481 --> 01:39:21,240
as possible.
The top of Mount Whitney and I'm.

2108
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:22,830
I'm constantly trying to put goals in 
front me,

2109
01:39:22,831 --> 01:39:27,831
but the biggest thing that I'm trying to
find more of myself and the only way I 

2110
01:39:27,831 --> 01:39:31,191
can find more as to silence the world 
out as much as I can because it's 

2111
01:39:31,191 --> 01:39:35,040
getting busier.
Everyday is getting faster and the 

2112
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,271
faster it gets,
the more you are missing who the fuck 

2113
01:39:38,271 --> 01:39:38,271
you are.

2114
01:39:38,271 --> 01:39:40,290
So I track my own mind a lot and say,
look man,

2115
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:42,990
I put my phone away.
I put shit away and I go dark.

2116
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:46,350
I go dark a lot and it's because I have 
to find out.

2117
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:51,560
I'm on a journey of life and we all have
a different journey and I want to be in 

2118
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:54,540
my fucking pine box and I believe your 
spirit is forever has to,

2119
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:59,570
to fucking powerful.
No way in hell that thing is dies when 

2120
01:39:59,570 --> 01:40:03,141
you die.
I want to be able to look back on my 

2121
01:40:03,141 --> 01:40:04,230
life and I'm all dead and be so fucking 
proud of myself forever.

2122
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:09,860
This is all temporary shit to me.
I want to be forever proud of who I was 

2123
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:13,350
as a man and change who I used to be.
The liar,

2124
01:40:13,351 --> 01:40:18,351
the insecure guy,
the guy who can whatever I want to be 

2125
01:40:18,351 --> 01:40:18,351
proud of,
and I if I died.

2126
01:40:18,351 --> 01:40:19,070
Now if I die at 80,
9,100,

2127
01:40:19,071 --> 01:40:21,120
I want to look at myself and say,
I'm proud of myself.

2128
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:26,180
Don't you think that also like we were 
saying that because you've gone through 

2129
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:28,020
so much struggle,
you appreciate happiness,

2130
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:33,050
true happiness.
Do you think that you appreciate 

2131
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:33,050
discipline because you weren't 
disciplined?

2132
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:37,360
Do you think you appreciate the hard 
work you put in because you used to be 

2133
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:37,360
weak?
Yes.

2134
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,160
I appreciate self-discipline.
Yes.

2135
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:43,250
I never had in the crazy thing about 
what you say that I didn't have a 

2136
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:45,540
motherfucker come wake me up at 3:00
in the fucking morning and say,

2137
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:46,530
hey,
you gotta get your shit in.

2138
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:49,620
I had no trainer.
I have a nutritionist.

2139
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:53,130
It was the self discipline that I had to
survive,

2140
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:55,170
not survive.
I was week to to,

2141
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:56,440
to,
to thrive.

2142
01:40:57,130 --> 01:40:58,090
No one said,
hey man,

2143
01:40:58,091 --> 01:40:59,830
your tour in [inaudible] 97 pounds,
man,

2144
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:01,720
I will help you out.

2145
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:03,760
I'll help [inaudible].
You're fucking.

2146
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:06,760
You're not smart.
I'm going to help you out.

2147
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:12,480
I had to work at all this shit I had to 
overcome and it,

2148
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:15,910
it,
it subdisciplines everything.

2149
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,040
If you don't have it,
I don't look at you right?

2150
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:21,760
Because I know you're capable of more.
It's not discipline so much for me.

2151
01:41:22,210 --> 01:41:25,300
It's all on you.
It's all on you.

2152
01:41:25,301 --> 01:41:27,490
The self part.
It was big.

2153
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:30,370
We need someone to hold people 
accountable.

2154
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:33,550
Fuck that shit man.
Fuck that shit.

2155
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:37,390
We count on people too much to get us 
through shit.

2156
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:40,600
And we looked to our right.
We look to our left and looking for help

2157
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:46,050
and if you can build that self,
you can build that total accountability 

2158
01:41:46,050 --> 01:41:48,460
and one self and it's not about being 
selfish.

2159
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:52,420
I'm trying to create a better me.
So hopefully people who are hearing this

2160
01:41:52,421 --> 01:41:56,440
are taking it the right way,
can say I can run a mile,

2161
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:59,470
anybody running 205 fucking miles doing 
fourth being and said,

2162
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:00,400
hey,
that shit,

2163
01:42:00,670 --> 01:42:05,670
she doesn't matter.
I want you to see how fucking far you 

2164
01:42:05,670 --> 01:42:09,361
can go.
And that's all it's about yourself and 

2165
01:42:09,361 --> 01:42:09,361
that's where it all comes from

2166
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:11,230
and I guarantee you've already done 
that.

2167
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:15,140
What you experience from watching a 
television show and what,

2168
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:20,280
what got you out the door,
what got you to sorta take the first 

2169
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:22,750
steps to change your life,
what you experienced by watching rocky,

2170
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:23,770
what you expect,
those,

2171
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:27,130
those moments of inspiration,
those are critical for people.

2172
01:42:27,131 --> 01:42:28,960
They need to know that someone's done 
something,

2173
01:42:28,961 --> 01:42:33,961
that someone's done something that's 
greater than they would they could 

2174
01:42:33,961 --> 01:42:36,811
imagine themselves doing and they want 
to take a step towards trying to be 

2175
01:42:36,811 --> 01:42:39,350
better.
That that inspiration is gigantic.

2176
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:41,890
And sometimes it comes across as corny.
You know,

2177
01:42:41,891 --> 01:42:45,490
people read too much of it online.
It becomes,

2178
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:49,510
it drowns out you,
you lose the meaning gets lost.

2179
01:42:49,511 --> 01:42:50,590
I mean there's.
And there's a lot of,

2180
01:42:50,591 --> 01:42:55,591
posers has,
a lot of people are out there that are 

2181
01:42:55,591 --> 01:42:58,680
pretending that they're trying to offer 
up inspiration or a true honest account 

2182
01:42:58,680 --> 01:42:59,290
of their experiences.

2183
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:03,430
But really what they're trying to do is 
say something that's going to get likes,

2184
01:43:03,730 --> 01:43:08,730
you know,
they're trying to say things that they 

2185
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:08,730
think people are going to go,
yeah,

2186
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:08,740
double high five.
You know,

2187
01:43:08,741 --> 01:43:13,741
there's a thing that people are doing 
where they're just trying to get social 

2188
01:43:13,781 --> 01:43:14,830
cred.
I said,

2189
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:16,240
your social media is,
man,

2190
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:18,730
I'll paint you the picture of my fake 
life.

2191
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:21,700
Right?
I paint you a picture of my fucking real

2192
01:43:21,701 --> 01:43:22,610
life.
Yeah.

2193
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:23,770
Period.
Like it or not,

2194
01:43:23,771 --> 01:43:27,950
man.
But that real life is fuel for people,

2195
01:43:27,970 --> 01:43:29,070
right?
It's fuel for me.

2196
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:31,090
I,
I love that shit.

2197
01:43:31,091 --> 01:43:36,091
I live off of it.
There's a lot of people that I follow 

2198
01:43:36,091 --> 01:43:38,131
online and you're one of them that I can
get something out of that I could watch 

2199
01:43:38,441 --> 01:43:41,890
a short clip of you talk and I'm sure it
clips of this podcast.

2200
01:43:41,891 --> 01:43:44,920
People are going to play these clips and
go for fucking crazy runs afterwards.

2201
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:45,940
Right?
Well hope so.

2202
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:51,060
Fuck yeah.
So you don't even have to hope it's 

2203
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:51,060
going to happen.
That's good.

2204
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:51,710
That's good.
What is this business you're doing?

2205
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:54,720
Well?
Is My own Goggins Llc.

2206
01:43:54,850 --> 01:43:58,010
Um,
basically I am invested in myself.

2207
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:02,810
I'm investing in myself and I hope that 
this story is,

2208
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:05,870
can,
can change somebody's life,

2209
01:44:06,410 --> 01:44:08,900
not to be me because ain't about me and 
I and I,

2210
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:14,170
I,
I try to be as real as I can because 

2211
01:44:14,170 --> 01:44:14,170
we're all fucking suffering in this 
world.

2212
01:44:14,170 --> 01:44:16,760
We're all hurting and I tried to take 
away all titles.

2213
01:44:16,761 --> 01:44:17,780
You want to give me that,
you know,

2214
01:44:17,781 --> 01:44:20,100
that I did not come from that shit.
That's,

2215
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:23,360
I have to be so authentic and so real 
about my own insecurities,

2216
01:44:23,361 --> 01:44:25,700
my own false ma.
This been a fucked up person.

2217
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:28,220
I'm not the best at anything.
I'm not,

2218
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,130
I'm not gifted,
I'm just driven.

2219
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:36,760
And um,
it's all about trying to share that 

2220
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:36,760
message with people.
This is all about,

2221
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:39,420
you know,
I speak to a lot of people and um,

2222
01:44:39,530 --> 01:44:40,760
that's what,
that's what I do now.

2223
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,690
And how are you doing it as a business?
I do some motivational speaking,

2224
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,900
but you know right now I'm not really 
trying to make a lot of fucking money.

2225
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:53,350
I'm just trying to build their brand as 
authentic as possible because I don't 

2226
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:56,561
want to build it too fast because my.
My biggest fear in life is people can 

2227
01:44:56,561 --> 01:44:58,070
rewrite through a motherfucker that's 
not real.

2228
01:44:58,910 --> 01:45:03,910
I do all the time,
like a lot of people have these great 

2229
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:03,910
quotes and they and they and they mass 
produce.

2230
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:09,970
I can't mass produce something man,
and they had these great quotes and 

2231
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:10,730
shit,
but are you living that motherfucker?

2232
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:14,420
What you just quoted in how powerful it 
may sound?

2233
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:17,990
Are you getting up every fucking morning
and about working out whatever.

2234
01:45:17,991 --> 01:45:22,991
Are you really getting the fuck after?
Are you just talking to motivate people 

2235
01:45:22,991 --> 01:45:24,020
and I don't want to be that guy.

2236
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:29,020
Or are you talking to pretend that 
you're exactly after it and people make 

2237
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:30,710
this big money over here the side,
which robin made a lot and they,

2238
01:45:30,711 --> 01:45:34,370
they,
they talk this shit and they're off this

2239
01:45:34,371 --> 01:45:36,800
until it's gone.
Then authentic it all,

2240
01:45:36,801 --> 01:45:39,830
man.
You got all this shit and I read it.

2241
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:40,250
I'm like,
man,

2242
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:40,900
this guy,
bullshit,

2243
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,500
bullshit,
bullshit,

2244
01:45:42,501 --> 01:45:43,850
man.
Fucking wake up,

2245
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,440
get after it.
Live what you're saying,

2246
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:48,880
and then it comes.
People can see when I talked,

2247
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:50,150
the reason I talk,
so fucking,

2248
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:53,990
just passionate because I'm reliving my 
fucking life.

2249
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:57,650
I'm reliving this morning when I got up,
I wouldn't do that shit.

2250
01:45:57,830 --> 01:46:00,560
I'm reliving everything I did and I 
can't speak to you.

2251
01:46:00,561 --> 01:46:04,370
Like all calm and shit just sucks.
It sucks man.

2252
01:46:04,371 --> 01:46:06,530
So whenever I started talking about like
after this podcast,

2253
01:46:06,531 --> 01:46:07,670
you'll see man,
God,

2254
01:46:07,671 --> 01:46:10,760
you're so calm right now.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2255
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:13,100
I'm not going back through that shit 
man.

2256
01:46:13,101 --> 01:46:15,410
I'm not.
I'm not going back through the suffering

2257
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:17,390
and shit that it took to become who I am
today.

2258
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:20,960
So I'm slowly trying to build this brand
to the point where I can slowly,

2259
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:25,040
hopefully make people feel motivated to 
driven because motivation is crap.

2260
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:30,270
It's shit.
People right now maybe listen to this 

2261
01:46:30,270 --> 01:46:30,270
shit.
They'll be motivated to go run.

2262
01:46:30,270 --> 01:46:33,230
If it's cold somewhere where they're at.
A lot of my friends will shut that door,

2263
01:46:33,231 --> 01:46:34,880
go back inside.
That's motivation.

2264
01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:39,440
It comes and go.
As how you feel if you and your wife are

2265
01:46:39,441 --> 01:46:40,730
good,
if you and your kids are good,

2266
01:46:40,731 --> 01:46:43,310
if you're good at work,
you're motivated.

2267
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:46,310
I like the motherfucker whose life is 
imploded,

2268
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:49,680
ain't got shit in life.
It says,

2269
01:46:50,950 --> 01:46:52,620
still got fucking get after it today,
man.

2270
01:46:53,210 --> 01:46:58,210
To is about.
So that's when you move from motivation 

2271
01:46:58,210 --> 01:47:00,681
to driven to obsessed and I want people 
to realize once you get to this person 

2272
01:47:00,681 --> 01:47:02,910
over here the driven obsessed part,
you're unstoppable.

2273
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:08,480
This commitment that you have to 
authenticity is one of the reasons why 

2274
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:09,810
people are connected to what your 
messages.

2275
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:12,120
That's one of the reasons why what 
you're saying,

2276
01:47:12,121 --> 01:47:14,820
you don't want to grow too fast.
You don't want it to be bullshit.

2277
01:47:14,821 --> 01:47:19,821
You're terrified of that thing.
Just like we were talking about with 

2278
01:47:19,821 --> 01:47:22,491
weak.
People are terrified of seeing that 

2279
01:47:22,491 --> 01:47:22,491
weakness in yourself.
You know,

2280
01:47:22,491 --> 01:47:26,331
we all see that.
We've all seen motivational things that 

2281
01:47:26,331 --> 01:47:29,601
are bullshit.
We've all talked to people that are 

2282
01:47:29,601 --> 01:47:30,810
talking and you realize there's nothing 
really that they're connected to.

2283
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:32,400
They're not really connected to their 
words,

2284
01:47:32,430 --> 01:47:37,430
the words,
just a bunch of words that they've 

2285
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:38,700
pieced together because they sound like 
something that someone who's enlightened

2286
01:47:38,701 --> 01:47:41,560
on the subject would say,
yeah,

2287
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:42,360
it does.
It doesn't,

2288
01:47:42,361 --> 01:47:44,010
it doesn't connect.
Oh,

2289
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:49,190
so you're struggle now is to try to 
figure out how to stay you and get the 

2290
01:47:49,190 --> 01:47:53,991
message out,
but still be fully connected to that 

2291
01:47:53,991 --> 01:47:53,991
message.

2292
01:47:53,991 --> 01:47:53,991
Right.
That's,

2293
01:47:53,991 --> 01:47:58,340
you know.
And it's not so much a struggle because 

2294
01:47:58,340 --> 01:47:58,340
I'm not really about.

2295
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:02,630
I'm not driven by the business.
I'm not,

2296
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:07,660
I'm not doing by trying to be.
I make a very small salary from being 

2297
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:08,630
retired from the military.
That's all I need.

2298
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:11,150
So I'm not fast to A.
I'm a,

2299
01:48:11,151 --> 01:48:15,260
I'm a minimalist motherfucker.
Give me a backpack of fucking ground and

2300
01:48:15,261 --> 01:48:20,261
sleep on and a pull up bar and a fucking
some running shoes in a subway sandwich 

2301
01:48:20,481 --> 01:48:23,660
or some shit and I'm fucking straight.
So it's,

2302
01:48:23,661 --> 01:48:25,370
um,
I believe in patients.

2303
01:48:26,210 --> 01:48:31,210
I'm a patient dude.
I can watch the piece of grass grow for 

2304
01:48:31,210 --> 01:48:34,631
20 years because I know that it is how 
you get somewhere in life by being that 

2305
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:41,800
month like mentality.
And being able to watch something grow 

2306
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:42,920
very commonly,
patiently,

2307
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:45,260
and that's all I'm doing right now.
It's not about money.

2308
01:48:45,261 --> 01:48:46,910
It's about people knowing me.
I'll keep you like me.

2309
01:48:47,390 --> 01:48:50,600
Whoever wants to hear this is out there.
It's also your,

2310
01:48:50,601 --> 01:48:53,720
your,
your goal is to grow this slowly,

2311
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:58,750
very slowly.
And your goal is to grow this in order 

2312
01:48:58,750 --> 01:48:59,510
to impact people.
Period.

2313
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,640
I said,
it's not about me.

2314
01:49:02,150 --> 01:49:04,850
Um,
what do you get out of impacting people?

2315
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:08,520
It's a good question.
I don't,

2316
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:11,220
I don't get anything out of it.
I'm a tool,

2317
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:16,850
but you must get something.
It must be personal satisfaction and 

2318
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:17,700
must be a connection to those people.
That must be,

2319
01:49:17,701 --> 01:49:18,900
it must be enriching to you.

2320
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:24,040
It's hard to connect with people because
there's quite a few now that are coming 

2321
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:24,590
in.
It's my duty.

2322
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:30,520
It's my duty to share my.
It's kind of like is somebody who 

2323
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:33,020
discovered a new earth,
you know,

2324
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:37,070
and discovered that people in the water 
source and the food source.

2325
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:42,680
I discovered a whole nother part of your
fucking brain that a lot of people don't

2326
01:49:43,161 --> 01:49:48,161
even know about is my job.
I being a fucking on this journey of 

2327
01:49:48,161 --> 01:49:51,420
being a discovery person,
being the person that maybe I discovered

2328
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:53,710
this part,
I discovered a very important part to.

2329
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:58,720
I haven't met many people that have 
discovered as part of a lot out there,

2330
01:49:59,530 --> 01:50:04,530
but it's my job now.
Take these weak people in the category 

2331
01:50:04,530 --> 01:50:07,330
that I was in and say I stopped reading 
the bullshit.

2332
01:50:07,331 --> 01:50:12,331
Stop listening to the bullshit and if,
if my story of success can impact 

2333
01:50:12,521 --> 01:50:13,570
somebody,
it is my job.

2334
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:17,410
It's my duty to share the story.
As much as I'm not really fond of it,

2335
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:18,820
I,
I'm not.

2336
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:21,880
I'm the kind of guy that wants to sit in
the fucking room and just be me.

2337
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:27,630
Just be me alone by myself as who I am,
but I have to get uncomfortable and tell

2338
01:50:29,621 --> 01:50:34,621
people all this shit.
I think it feels good to tell me about 

2339
01:50:34,621 --> 01:50:36,901
it.
At a fourth grade reading level in high 

2340
01:50:36,901 --> 01:50:36,901
school,
I stuttered.

2341
01:50:36,901 --> 01:50:38,320
I lied to people to be their fucking 
friends.

2342
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,440
It didn't feel good.
It doesn't feel good at all,

2343
01:50:41,770 --> 01:50:46,720
but maybe someone is doing the same shit
and maybe they can realize,

2344
01:50:46,721 --> 01:50:51,721
wow,
that motherfucker was a piece of shit 

2345
01:50:51,721 --> 01:50:54,800
and he fucking now as a navy seal,
retired guy and runs these miles and was

2346
01:50:55,211 --> 01:50:59,230
297 pounds and pathetic fucker.
And Wow.

2347
01:50:59,860 --> 01:51:00,770
And people say,
why are you talking?

2348
01:51:00,810 --> 01:51:02,260
So it's the fucking truth.

2349
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:05,470
I was a fucking pathetic motherfucker,
man.

2350
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,540
People cannot say that to themselves.
This.

2351
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:11,130
We have to choose these great fucking 
magical words that,

2352
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:16,250
that makes that make people feel good.
Tell yourself the truth is,

2353
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:19,780
I'm gonna cause you fucking fat.
There may be bullying you,

2354
01:51:19,781 --> 01:51:23,590
but you might be fucking fat.
Some of cars you're dumb.

2355
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:26,110
It's mean,
but you might be fucking dumb.

2356
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:28,660
It's life,
man.

2357
01:51:28,661 --> 01:51:32,650
Take it for what it's worth and change 
it and that terrible feeling.

2358
01:51:32,651 --> 01:51:34,540
When someone does tell you that you're 
fat,

2359
01:51:35,050 --> 01:51:36,640
you can use that as fuel,
as fuel,

2360
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:39,220
period.
And that's all this is about.

2361
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:39,980
And,
and,

2362
01:51:39,981 --> 01:51:44,140
and where it goes.
If it goes somewhere and whatever,

2363
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,330
you know,
I don't give a shit.

2364
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:51,360
Well,
you said something that I think of when 

2365
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:51,360
I run and I said most people quit at 40 
percent.

2366
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:53,020
I said,
that's my 40 percent rule,

2367
01:51:53,021 --> 01:51:53,320
man.

2368
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:55,540
I love that quote.
Forty percent rule man.

2369
01:51:55,541 --> 01:51:56,140
And I,
um,

2370
01:51:56,730 --> 01:51:58,750
I,
I really developed that through my heart

2371
01:51:58,751 --> 01:52:01,420
surgeries and I developed that through 
that first hundred mile run.

2372
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:05,800
And I thought I had given 100 percent 
that was on that chair at mile 70.

2373
01:52:05,801 --> 01:52:10,801
I was fucked up.
I thought I'd give it 100 percent and 

2374
01:52:10,801 --> 01:52:10,801
they go,
that last I go,

2375
01:52:10,801 --> 01:52:11,860
man,
there has this.

2376
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:17,640
I wouldn't even near 100 percent.
So I came up with this thing called the 

2377
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:21,190
40 percent rule is basically where you,
it's like a car,

2378
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:25,570
you put a governor on a car and they 
said the car can go 1:30.

2379
01:52:25,571 --> 01:52:27,430
That governor stops the car,
91.

2380
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:29,030
And your drive and thinking,
man,

2381
01:52:29,031 --> 01:52:30,670
I want to fucking Florida,
but I can't go.

2382
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:33,340
I can't go any faster.
We do at your brain.

2383
01:52:33,341 --> 01:52:34,650
We put a governor on the brain 
secretary,

2384
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:36,460
feel pain,
discomfort,

2385
01:52:36,910 --> 01:52:41,910
suffering,
all those words that we hate to say 

2386
01:52:41,910 --> 01:52:41,910
because we in this happy,
peaceful world we live in.

2387
01:52:41,910 --> 01:52:44,800
Now we stop,
we slow down,

2388
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:50,250
and if you can get through these 
different barriers and gain five 

2389
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:50,250
percent,
two percent,

2390
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:52,010
three percent debt,
40 percent becomes 60,

2391
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:53,980
that 60,
70,

2392
01:52:54,050 --> 01:52:59,050
80 and 90,
and then you'll hopefully one day near 

2393
01:52:59,050 --> 01:52:59,050
100.
I don't,

2394
01:52:59,050 --> 01:52:59,900
I don't know.
Many people will probably add 100.

2395
01:53:00,070 --> 01:53:01,760
I mean we think we're there,
but there's so much more.

2396
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:03,860
It isn't a 100 death's door though.
I really,

2397
01:53:04,390 --> 01:53:05,840
I love that.
I think is true.

2398
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:09,620
I think that's 100 percent true.
I think when you were laying on top,

2399
01:53:09,630 --> 01:53:13,070
you'd knocked on a door.
That is a hundred percent true.

2400
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:15,140
No one has ever.
That is 100 percent truth.

2401
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:19,340
I didn't give 100 percent in that 101 
mile run I did for the first time.

2402
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:23,150
So that's the scary thing.
That's the scariest thing in the world.

2403
01:53:23,151 --> 01:53:26,300
I didn't die.
You probably gave 99 point nine,

2404
01:53:26,301 --> 01:53:26,900
nine,
nine,

2405
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:27,860
nine,
nine.

2406
01:53:28,740 --> 01:53:30,190
I guarantee.

2407
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:34,270
Guarantee Man.
Dude,

2408
01:53:34,271 --> 01:53:36,050
I don't know how to end this any better 
than that.

2409
01:53:36,230 --> 01:53:40,460
So let's just wrap this up.
If people want to find your stuff,

2410
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:43,640
what was the best place to go and look 
for it?

2411
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:45,290
I'm just at David Goggins,
man.

2412
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:47,720
Social media or an instagram.
Facebook.

2413
01:53:48,290 --> 01:53:50,050
I don't tweet that much stuff out 
because,

2414
01:53:50,051 --> 01:53:51,380
um,
I write these.

2415
01:53:52,030 --> 01:53:57,030
I write messages and always linked it on
twitter to facebook and Instagram,

2416
01:53:57,471 --> 01:54:00,710
but it's just at David Goggins is an 
honor and privilege.

2417
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:02,060
Thanks so much,
man.

2418
01:54:02,061 --> 01:54:02,630
I appreciate it.
Really,

2419
01:54:02,631 --> 01:54:04,580
really appreciate it.
Thank you David Goggins.

2420
01:54:04,581 --> 01:54:06,860
Ladies and gentlemen,
go after it.

2421
01:54:06,861 --> 01:54:08,810
You motherfuckers.
Come on.

2422
01:54:10,270 --> 01:54:13,250
That doesn't.
