1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,560
Alright.
Oh wait,

2
00:00:02,561 --> 00:00:03,394
where are we going live?

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,103
Boom.
Mic live.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,860
Mr Carroll.
How are you sir?

5
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:14,970
I'm very good feedback.
Very good to have you back.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,953
So,
uh,

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,670
you have a podcast now?
I do.

8
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:19,200
I've joined the ranks.
You've inspired me.

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,210
Well,
you know,

10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,650
it's important.
We need people like you out there.

11
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:23,910
You are,
you have like,

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,260
what,
seven episodes so far?

13
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:29,010
Seven episodes up a few more in the can.
I'm going to try to dribble mail once a

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,730
week,
uh,

15
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,560
for the first six months or so.
See how it goes.

16
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,350
Are you enjoying the process?
I am mindscape by the way,

17
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:36,000
is the name for those out there in
podcast land?

18
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:36,811
Yeah,
I'm loving it.

19
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:37,230
You know,
the,

20
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,870
the real,
the thing that tilted me over toward

21
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:40,890
doing it because like,
look,

22
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,090
it's,
I have a day job,

23
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:43,860
right?
I can't spend too much time doing this

24
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:44,980
stuff.
Um,

25
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,890
but what I realized it was an excuse,
a licensed to talk to people who are not

26
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:51,050
just physicists,
right?

27
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,180
Because like I had the intellectual
interests that go way beyond just what I

28
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:55,890
do for a living.
And in academia,

29
00:00:55,891 --> 00:01:00,390
you're not allowed to take seriously
anything other than your discipline,

30
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:01,350
your job,
right?

31
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:04,020
I'm allowed to be talking about physics,
but nothing else.

32
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:07,590
But so now I can talk to historians and
economists and philosophers and

33
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:09,390
psychologists and it's great.
Well,

34
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:12,420
you could've just gone to evergreen
state and then you could talk about

35
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,400
anything.
Teaching a professor.

36
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,350
You could just,
if you're a professor,

37
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:19,650
you could teach them dance.
We have to break it out of the system.

38
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:20,630
We have to do it ourselves.
Yeah,

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,470
man.
Got To break out of that system.

40
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,390
So your podcast,
you decided that this would be a great

41
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:31,800
venue for you to just to expand on
subjects and just get into anything that

42
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,000
you'd like.
Well,

43
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:33,440
you know,
I,

44
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,410
I have opinions about things and I've
never been one who said you shouldn't

45
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:39,450
talk about things unless you're a phd.

46
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,500
Credentialed expert,
right?

47
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,450
I think everyone should be talking about
everything,

48
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,660
but you should know what your level of
expertise is.

49
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,080
So if you're not an expert and you
should listen to people and they should

50
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,050
then make your own decisions.
But you should first gathered the

51
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:55,470
information and so I don't feel quite
like I can go,

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,750
I have a blog and write whatever I want
on my blog,

53
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:01,620
but I can't really expound on my
theories of economics because what do I

54
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,610
know about economics,
but I can call up but very expert

55
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:08,700
economist and chat with them when the
podcast and both I will learn something

56
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:11,670
and hopefully the listeners as well.
So you're going to just basically talk

57
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:16,320
about anything.
The shtick is we sort of tried to pick

58
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:17,460
an idea,
right?

59
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:19,830
So for the hour or whatever it is,
I don't have your statement.

60
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:21,650
I can't do the two and a half hour
thing.

61
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,400
I know I need more.
I need more nitrogen caffeine in me.

62
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,750
But uh,
yeah,

63
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:29,010
for an hour,
hour and a half,

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,900
uh,
I'll get someone who's an expert and

65
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,660
we'll dig into an idea and try to
understand what's going on,

66
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:34,141
you know,
in,

67
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:38,670
in sort of everyday people's language
and how it fits into the bigger picture

68
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:40,800
and things like that.
And uh,

69
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,750
trying to mix up,
you know,

70
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,690
good old professors,
which are my peer group to sort of,

71
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,550
I got some people coming out of left
field.

72
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:50,520
I had a professional poker player,
I have a movie director coming up,

73
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,320
a chef and things like that.
So,

74
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,490
but basically,
yeah,

75
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:55,560
whatever I want to talk about.
That's awesome.

76
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,420
So is this for your own edification or
are you just using it as just a

77
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,960
platform?
Like what?

78
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,760
Yeah,
I think that my,

79
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,450
like philosophically I treat it like
it's for me,

80
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,010
right?

81
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,010
Like I'm not going to do guests or
topics or not do topics because the

82
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,090
people say so.
Right,

83
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,450
right.
There's plenty of people out there who

84
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,750
don't want me to talk about anything
other than physics or at least nothing

85
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:21,880
that involves politics or religion.
Stay in your lane,

86
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:22,990
Bro.
Very much.

87
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:25,180
Right.
But I love talking about politics and

88
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,290
religion.
So guess what,

89
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,750
I'm going to talk about those things.
Um,

90
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,240
and so,
and then hopefully it finds an audience,

91
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,470
right.
And uh,

92
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,480
so I'm willing to listen to suggestions,
but mostly I have to treat it like it's

93
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,410
for me.
Well,

94
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:42,880
I think it's absurd to ask someone to
not talk about things if people love

95
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:45,460
doing it.
Like I especially love,

96
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:47,800
you know,
the commenters saying,

97
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,551
Oh,
you know,

98
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:51,490
of course he's a scientist so he knows
nothing about politics.

99
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:53,690
I'm like,
you're an anonymous youtube commentor.

100
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,260
Why should I listen to your opinions
about politics?

101
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,560
You definitely can't listen to the
opinions of anybody that's willing to

102
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:02,230
take the time to comment on Youtube.
What?

103
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,940
That's a problem with that whole bit
about it because I was like,

104
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:09,290
what kind of a person does that?
Like who,

105
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,000
who listens to a video and goes wall
time that are put her in March.

106
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,290
He takes it very rare breed.
Unless they have like a real specific

107
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:23,440
expertise in what's being discussed.
Like maybe it's about auto repair and

108
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:25,630
like that is not how you replace a
transmission.

109
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,150
Here's why.
Or if you just ask him questions like I

110
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:31,600
love my calendar's like mostly the
comments even on my youtube,

111
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,940
like so I send the video,
I don't do video,

112
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,710
right?
I'm just doing audio podcasts.

113
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:40,360
But you can put them on youtube with the
static image and for some reason people

114
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:40,780
like that.

115
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,460
People listen to podcasts on Youtube,
right?

116
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,920
Yeah.
And uh,

117
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,970
the comments have actually overall been
surprisingly good because youtube is one

118
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:49,840
of the worst,
right?

119
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,650
And overall,
but you know,

120
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,510
people say like,
oh,

121
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:55,900
I didn't know that or tell me more about
this or this was interesting.

122
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,850
That's great.
By all means do it.

123
00:04:57,851 --> 00:04:59,260
But if you're like,
don't talk about that,

124
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:00,850
I want to hear about this,
then you know,

125
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,410
block,
go away.

126
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,500
It only takes a tiny drop of Lsd to
pollute a whole bucket of water.

127
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,460
There you can really,
what the deal is with youtube comments,

128
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:15,960
it's just the sheer number of people
there.

129
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,980
The problem is that youtube has a
dedicated group of shitheads and trolls

130
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,130
for whatever reason.
I don't know why would that platform

131
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:27,730
seems to track some of the worst in
people that comment and I'm,

132
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,380
you know,
I cannot claim that I'm immune to a

133
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,720
reading it and getting annoyed.

134
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,430
I'm like,
you idiot,

135
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,220
I know.
I should just say forget it.

136
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,230
Move on with my life.
And I'm like,

137
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,880
dammit,
well it's,

138
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,950
it's interesting in a lot of ways.
I mean there's something fascinating

139
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:52,951
about this new form of communication
where someone can send this a very just

140
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,680
flat text,
you don't know anything about the

141
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:02,620
background of the person who's sending
it and there's a style of doing that

142
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,600
that's designed to kind of mess with
your head just to poke out your nerves.

143
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,870
Right?
And I look,

144
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,920
let's let,
let me just,

145
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,660
you know,
just to redress the balance here.

146
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,960
Um,
it's great that we have these new ways

147
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:16,220
of talking to each other.
Right?

148
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:20,870
And part of glancingly mentioned the
fact that academia wants you to stay in

149
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:22,040
your lane very,
very much.

150
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:26,510
And I think that that's a shame.
And so I think that part of the many

151
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:31,511
hidden purposes of my podcast,
one of them is to dissolve the boundary

152
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,310
between science and the rest of our
intellectual life.

153
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:34,641
Right?
Like,

154
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:35,960
I'm not going to.
Sometimes they'll be talking about

155
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,070
science,
sometimes I won't.

156
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:40,520
Like we,
we tend to silo off science as a thing.

157
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,520
And then like economy,
economics and history and political

158
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:46,010
science is another thing that is out
there and relevant to the world and

159
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:48,320
science is something that is sort of a
form of entertainment for a lot of

160
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:51,770
people and I want to mix it all up by
the different people talking to each

161
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:55,340
other.
And so overall by all means comment on

162
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:57,620
the youtube videos and you'll keep that
conversation going.

163
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,030
That's good of you.
That's,

164
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,100
that's,
that's a very healthy attitude and

165
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:03,830
that's kind of the attitude that you
have to have if you're putting

166
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:05,150
everything out there.
Yeah.

167
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:09,020
And just one more irony is like,
I'm not a,

168
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,230
I don't seek conflict.
I'm a conflict averse person.

169
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,630
Like I just want,
I don't want to argue with people,

170
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,200
but I do want to say things that are
true and not everyone agrees about what

171
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:18,560
is true.

172
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,540
So there's going to be arguments.
So I put up with that,

173
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:25,541
but I'm not seeking it out.
So I would like this utopia of rational

174
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:30,380
discourse where everyone is talking
about ideas in a dispassionate way and

175
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:32,690
in good faith looking toward moving
toward the truth.

176
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,410
It would be nice if we had like a
system,

177
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,010
like almost like a rating system for
humans,

178
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:43,490
like a yelp for commentators that people
are trying,

179
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,010
that it's not a bad idea.
It really isn't.

180
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:49,610
In terms of like,
like people review your comments on

181
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:54,410
things and enough people decide like
this is just unnecessary yelp for

182
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:57,890
expertise or for commentary and
generally all the above.

183
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,740
Yeah,
I mean I think uh,

184
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,480
we're probably going to move to some
sort of a system like that.

185
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:05,630
In fact,
some people are actually advocating that

186
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:11,410
for society to have some sort of a like
a rating system for people and almost a

187
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,320
new kind of currency,
like a social currency.

188
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,370
They're doing it in China.
Right?

189
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:24,371
You've heard this scary for people
though because it's China and China is

190
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,400
a,
it's a trippy place and it's very trippy

191
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:32,360
in terms of.
It's sort of got capitalism going,

192
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:36,930
but it's also a communist dictatorship
and this is big for the government in

193
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:38,840
the.
All the companies are also in,

194
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,640
you know,
the thing with Huawei.

195
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,340
Am I saying it right?
People are getting mad at me about that.

196
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:45,320
Huawei,
I think it's Walway,

197
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,730
it's the now that number two cell phone
manufacturer in the world and they're

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
for bidden to work with us carriers.
The United States does not trust this

199
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:58,110
company.
So they've said,

200
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,690
you know,
this company is apparently done some

201
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:04,020
shading things according to them,
not according to certain tech people say

202
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,900
it's nonsense,
but there so that another,

203
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:11,310
keeping them from selling their cell
phones with 18 t and t mobile,

204
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:12,000
whatever.

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
Uh,
but they're the number two manufacturer

206
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:17,030
in the world now that just surpassed
apple because China is just.

207
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,800
Okay.
Yeah,

208
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,870
China's a trip.
Yeah.

209
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,280
Well it's,
it's,

210
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,240
they know very well.
It's kind of remarkable to me that China

211
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:27,450
has been so stable and successful
because there are,

212
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,040
you know,
people who don't like it.

213
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,050
There are people who rebel against the
system,

214
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:33,690
but they've been.
So the government's been so enormously

215
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:35,790
successful in controlling inflammation.
Yeah,

216
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,780
totally.
What you learn,

217
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:40,210
like you can't Google Tiananmen Square
if you're trying to a,

218
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,270
you can't get those images or anything
like that.

219
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,350
And companies want to do business there
so they'll go along with it.

220
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,660
And I'm not sure if it's stable
building.

221
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,880
Anyhow,
I talked about this when I last podcast

222
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,190
with the ultra monk.
I'm not sure that democracy is stable

223
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:53,971
either,
so,

224
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:54,960
um,
when,

225
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,470
when the technological capabilities are
changing so rapidly,

226
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,520
a huge abuses and huge changes are on
the horizon.

227
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,660
Even we don't know what they're going to
be.

228
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:04,350
I mean,
that's,

229
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,090
that's my worry about the social credit
system,

230
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:06,541
right?
Like,

231
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:10,230
it's.
So obviously abusable make the wrong

232
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:12,000
people have bad credit and make the
people you like.

233
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,700
I mean,
if this is run by the government,

234
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,630
you're going to trust them to,
uh,

235
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,210
do it fairly.
I,

236
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:19,970
you know,
I'm a little skeptical about that.

237
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,790
Well,
I think this last election and the

238
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,850
subsequent analysis of the manipulation
of the election has been very eyeopening

239
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,170
to people.
And,

240
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,800
um,
the,

241
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,770
the Russian troll farms,
have you been paying attention to that

242
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,620
stuff?
That is,

243
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,660
that is a stunning revelation that
there's 24 slash seven businesses where

244
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:49,011
people are set up where they're hired to
just tweet and post things and comment

245
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:55,761
on things.
And they're all working in some way to

246
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:58,470
try to manipulate the way people look at
the news.

247
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,240
Yeah,
and the most interesting thing to me,

248
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:02,880
I thought like if they were clever,
they will do this and they do it.

249
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,620
It's not just that they have a policy
that they want to push,

250
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,090
right?
Or candidate they want to push,

251
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,680
they want to foment disagreement.
They will take the most radical views on

252
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:17,850
either side and pump them up just so
Americans are tearing at each other's

253
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,470
throats.
And yeah,

254
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,460
that kind of works.
Right?

255
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:22,020
That's,
that's pretty successful so far.

256
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,730
There was a radiolab podcast where these
people that were trump supporters

257
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,180
detailed being contacted by these
Russian troll farms where they organize

258
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:38,451
these rallies and they organize these
protests and they even hired a fake

259
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:41,310
hillary.
They fought,

260
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:46,140
they hired a fake trump and they're
gonna have the Hillary and a cage and

261
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:48,990
they wanted everybody to yell out,
lock her up and this,

262
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,840
these Russians coordinated this whole
thing.

263
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,130
Right.
And then once it starts,

264
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,010
know,
organically

265
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,880
takes over.
Right?

266
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,763
I mean,
you,

267
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,860
you probably saw just the other day this
a trump rally where the CNN reporter was

268
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:05,140
trying to do a seminar.
I'm trying to do a camera spot and he

269
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,100
just like got drowned out by people
shouting at him and you know,

270
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,700
shouting obscenities and I,
I don't know what,

271
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,551
that,
that's bad.

272
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:13,061
Right?
Okay.

273
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:13,830
I mean,
it's bad.

274
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,270
The media.
I wouldn't want that to happen to Fox

275
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,500
News.
I wouldn't want that to happen to people

276
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:20,160
that disagree with you.
GotTa let the people in the media,

277
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,310
but media,
they're not the enemy of the people and

278
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,790
what he's done is very dangerous.
You know,

279
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,050
it's,
it's very,

280
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,790
it's very sneaky and very dangerous and
it's very manipulative and he's

281
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,940
essentially,
he's in survival mode and when people

282
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:35,480
are in survival mode,
they,

283
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,220
he's not thinking at all about the
importance of the press.

284
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,590
He's thinking about his,
his situation,

285
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,960
his stance,
his position in life.

286
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,660
Preserve that.
And what's the best way to preserve that

287
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:49,210
when someone's attacking me,
attack the people who are attacking me.

288
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:49,901
Any.
Yeah.

289
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:53,910
You build yourself up by creating an
enemy that everyone can agree on right?

290
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,710
One of the chilling things that you
pointed out,

291
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,100
there's really,
despite the rhetoric,

292
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:05,350
there's never been a successful,
truly multiethnic democracy in the

293
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,720
history of the world,
like democracies that have worked,

294
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,090
have worked because one group is the
boss,

295
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,820
right?
And you know,

296
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,930
they give rights to the rest of the
people and so forth and try to be fair

297
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,350
to some extent,
but that's changing,

298
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:19,630
like as the demographics of the world
are changing,

299
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,980
uh,
we're,

300
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,960
we're becoming more of the patchwork
that we claimed to be years ago and

301
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:28,780
people aren't quite happy with that.
They're not comfortable with it.

302
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,380
And this is something that can be used
to gin up emotional reactions.

303
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,200
Yeah.
There's people are terrified of change

304
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:38,680
too.
So is this nostalgia for the past?

305
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah.
And you know,

306
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:42,790
the past that is not necessarily
accurate that they,

307
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,800
that they,
that they envision.

308
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,700
Um,
and,

309
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,760
and it's,
and I'm sympathetic with the real

310
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,421
problems,
right?

311
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:53,470
They're real problems with inequality
and with healthcare and with jobs and

312
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:55,270
you know,
not just the number of jobs,

313
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:59,080
but the jobs are changing.
Not everyone is really tooled up to be a

314
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:02,110
high tech,
a office worker in this day and age and

315
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,420
so I take those concerns really,
really seriously,

316
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:08,770
but those concerns being channeled and
very unproductive ways to scapegoat

317
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:10,670
people who don't deserve it.
One of the things,

318
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,250
it's fascinating to me,
this seems to be boiling under the

319
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:18,251
surface is the possibility that we might
need some sort of universal basic income

320
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:23,921
to deal with what's happening with ai
and automate automate station like auto

321
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,800
automation of m cars,
automation of normal jobs that put food

322
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,550
preparation and things that people have
come to.

323
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,580
Just take for granted that a human's
going to be doing that.

324
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,490
It's entirely possible that millions and
millions and millions of people are

325
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:43,970
going to be out of work within a very
short period of time and it seems to me

326
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:46,220
that it's just.
It's one of those sneaky things that

327
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:48,230
might just catch us before we're ready
for it.

328
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,010
Yeah.
I think that if you extrapolate very far

329
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,540
ahead into the future and imagining what
utopia is supposed to look like or you

330
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,190
know the far technologically advanced
civilization,

331
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,810
why wouldn't we imagined that work is
done by robots and machines and human

332
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:07,400
beings are free to be creative or
artistic or athletic or just sit on

333
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:08,900
their butts if that's what they want to
do.

334
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,370
If you believe that that's a possible
future than the way to get there is to,

335
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:17,960
as robots and machines do more and more,
make it more and more possible for

336
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:21,170
people to live without working.
I think that's a is at least I have no

337
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,240
idea whether it works in practice.
I'm not an economist.

338
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:25,970
I haven't studied it,
but I think it should be taken seriously

339
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:29,380
as an idea.
If you looked at it as a pessimist and

340
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:30,950
if you looked at it with a cynical
perspective,

341
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:31,960
you'd say,
well,

342
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,080
people just want.

343
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,740
They don't have motivation.
Then they behave like rich kids or

344
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:39,230
entitled people or people who won the
lottery.

345
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:41,690
They blow all the money.
They don't take it seriously because

346
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,030
they didn't earn it.
It goes against human nature.

347
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,350
Yep.
I get that.

348
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,160
And maybe it does let them do it.
Who,

349
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,980
who am I to tell people that they need
to be virtuous by earning a living in

350
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:54,920
some job they may or may not be able to
keep for very long.

351
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,650
The people who say that usually haven't
gotten fired from their jobs raise.

352
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,281
Right?
Right,

353
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:00,500
right.
Yeah.

354
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,430
And I always feel like the people that
are actually ambitious but the real

355
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,050
problem,
and I think we'd be growing up with

356
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:08,300
that,
I think if you,

357
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,230
you've got it as an adult,
you'd probably recognize it as a safety

358
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:13,064
net.
It is.

359
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,850
But as if it was during your
developmental process,

360
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,370
you might rely on it as a constant.

361
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,130
Yeah.
And so that might be a problem in terms

362
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,660
of motivation.
I think so,

363
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:24,640
and I think that,
uh,

364
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,491
and you see it,
right?

365
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:25,801
I mean,
I,

366
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:27,980
I,
I have friends at various levels of

367
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,250
income and class that they grew up in
and you can always tell people who grew

368
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,410
up in very comfortable,
uh,

369
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:35,330
environments because they don't have
jobs,

370
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:38,780
they have projects.
I'm working on a project because they're

371
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,940
not really worried about the project
failing.

372
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:43,820
You know,
like if you grew up without that safety

373
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:45,980
net,
you're more cautious.

374
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,660
Like you have to have a fail safe,
you have to have a backup plan and.

375
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,430
But what if everyone had that backup
plan?

376
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:54,650
What if we could all do projects instead
of work?

377
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,130
Is that really a worse world?
I didn't know any trust fund people.

378
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,240
Oh yeah,
yeah.

379
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,070
The ones that I know all blow their
money.

380
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,540
Actually I know some,
I know some very wealthy people who

381
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,600
raise their kids really well and you
trust fund people.

382
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,640
Oh yeah.
As people who like never need to work a

383
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:12,170
day in their lives and they all work
really hard.

384
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,120
That's so weird.
It's possible.

385
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,930
Find those people and clone them.
Yeah.

386
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,590
Find out what made them tick,
what was there.

387
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,740
So they found a passion.
They found something that they're

388
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,360
actually,
that seems to be a giant issue.

389
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,970
That's right.
And your parents need to sort of

390
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:27,570
encouraged that,
you know,

391
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,020
um,
you know,

392
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,030
parents matter when it comes to like,
if you're,

393
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,850
if you are very wealthy,
do you feel like you deserve it or do

394
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:35,571
you feel like,
oh,

395
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:37,580
I should give something back because I'm
really,

396
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:38,930
really fortunate.
Well,

397
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:41,990
there's cockamamie ideas that come from
people that haven't earned their money

398
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:43,910
to,
like one guy came to him with this crazy

399
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:46,760
idea for this project he's doing and
wanting me to get involved in it.

400
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,140
And I was,
I was going over the details of it.

401
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:50,790
I was like,
I don't think this is going to work.

402
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,130
Like why?
Why is this guy so enthusiastic about

403
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:54,460
it?
And then the more I dug into it,

404
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:54,871
I'm like,
oh,

405
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:57,400
he got all this money from his dad.
Oh,

406
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,630
well you go,
this guy is just,

407
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,760
he just,
he's got pipe dreams.

408
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,511
Yeah,
I mean,

409
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:05,370
I guess I feel just to be honest about
it,

410
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,280
like I'm very lucky,
uh,

411
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,940
not because I grew up wealthy because I
didn't.

412
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,080
But because I now have a job that
represents what I want to do,

413
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:18,081
like what I would do with my life if I
were independently wealthy.

414
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,520
Isn't that different from what I'm doing
right now?

415
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,590
Right.
That's exactly.

416
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,130
But therefore I kind of think that I
would like a world where everyone can do

417
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:27,120
that.
If that's what they wanted,

418
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,680
that would be amazing.

419
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,660
Yeah.
The real question is,

420
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:33,840
does everybody have an actual interest?
And if they don't,

421
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,930
is it nurture or nature?
And if they don't,

422
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:40,740
do we force them to.
Is that we want to do something you

423
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:42,510
love,
find something you love.

424
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,430
The thing I,
you know,

425
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:46,290
I'm actually,
I never tell people like,

426
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,880
follow your passion or plain what do you
love?

427
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,560
Because look,
there's a lot of people who need to earn

428
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,390
a living,
right?

429
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:55,390
He's loving people who just need to do
work because they need to pay the bills.

430
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:57,780
That's fine.
That should be respected.

431
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,740
That in the we have right now,
that's an an honorable thing to do and

432
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,570
not everyone gets to just do what they
love.

433
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,510
That's true.
There are some things though that you

434
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:09,390
can do for a living.
They you'll actually enjoy,

435
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,750
like you need to make a living,
but because of your temperament,

436
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,330
because your interests,
you can find a thing,

437
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:20,331
whether it's carpentry or whatever it is
that you find to be fascinating and

438
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,020
fulfilling when you're actually doing.

439
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,510
You're making a living,
but you're also doing something that,

440
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:24,961
man,
I.

441
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:27,150
This is very satisfying.
Maybe,

442
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,710
maybe that's true.
I mean,

443
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,180
it's certainly true.
It can be done.

444
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:31,950
Can it be done for everyone in the
world?

445
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,630
I don't know.
That's a good question.

446
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,100
I don't know.
Well,

447
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:37,100
there's so many styles of living too.
You know,

448
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,850
when you're talking about China.
Uh,

449
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,350
I was in China recently.
We spent some time in Thailand and we

450
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:45,270
flew through China.
And one of the things you realized about

451
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:50,130
China is that just a totally different
way of moving.

452
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,730
Like people just walk right through
people.

453
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,720
Yeah.
I mean they,

454
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,350
their lines,
if there's a space and align the peanut,

455
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,020
they don't respect that space.
They go right into that space right in

456
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:01,590
front of you.
Like,

457
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,640
oh,
there's a space there.

458
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,340
They didn't even think of it as rude.
It's not just the style,

459
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:05,560
right?

460
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,220
Yeah.
It's just this week we went through

461
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,210
Southeast Asia for a few weeks and you
know,

462
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,930
visited Vietnam and Thailand and they're
right next to each other,

463
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:15,180
but just the behavior and the city's
utterly different.

464
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,400
Like just walking down the street.
It's just a different culture.

465
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,070
I haven't been to Vietnam.
What was that like?

466
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,280
Vietnam was my favorite.
It was,

467
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,750
yeah.
Everybody says that.

468
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,130
It's great.
I mean,

469
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:24,750
I don't know.
I was there for a few days.

470
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:26,430
Right.
I'm sure that there's depths to the

471
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:28,450
country that I didn't perceive.
But uh,

472
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,420
you know,
it was coming to life literally the week

473
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:31,830
we were,
there was the first.

474
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:34,770
Mcdonald's was opening in Vietnam,
so,

475
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,990
which is not good,
but at least it meant it was.

476
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,450
We were there in a pre Mcdonald's
society.

477
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:40,840
Right.
And the,

478
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,950
it was physically very beautiful.
The food was amazing.

479
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,970
It was all scattered,
shot,

480
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:48,280
like the people just go crazy on the
streets in any direction they want and

481
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,050
it was not organized or anything like
that,

482
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,360
but it was very genuine,
you know,

483
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:52,630
it was.

484
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,960
People were trying to be nice,
people seem to be very friendly like

485
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:58,300
that.
We didn't speak any other language or

486
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:00,910
anything like that.
And uh,

487
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,650
it was just a wonderful experience
overall.

488
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:04,000
Yeah.
That's awesome.

489
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,880
Yeah.
A Asia is a trip.

490
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,770
It's a really different part of the
world.

491
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:09,461
China is,
yeah.

492
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:10,180
I've been trying to,
to,

493
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,030
and it's,
it's a,

494
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,670
that's a trip for a different reason.
Right.

495
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,690
And uh,
you know,

496
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,320
I,
it,

497
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,320
I'm scared by China in the sense that I,
I'm worried that they will succeed while

498
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,100
still being repressive dictatorship.
Right.

499
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,450
Like,
uh,

500
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:27,160
I remember reading these memoirs from
Bertrand Russell when he visited China

501
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,520
and uh,
he was rhapsodizing about this is an

502
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:31,990
amazing culture,
amazing people.

503
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:32,830
This is great.
And I'm like,

504
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,750
does he not know it's a communist
dictatorship?

505
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,800
And then my brain kicked in.
I'm like,

506
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,000
oh no,
it was 1912.

507
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,370
It was not a communist dictatorship at
the time.

508
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:43,780
And that there's a great tragedy in the
way that China has been sort of

509
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:48,280
repressed for so long.
I think there's immense potential and

510
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:51,250
promise there,
but it's also the possibility that they

511
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:55,870
just remain in this autocracy forever
and some people's lives improve and a

512
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:58,270
lot of people just drudgery for billions
of people.

513
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,890
Yeah.
It's totally possible.

514
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,930
It's,
it's fascinating that they become this

515
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:03,380
combination of things.
Yeah.

516
00:22:03,381 --> 00:22:05,620
A combination of both capitalism and
communism.

517
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,700
Yeah.
Well I think that's it.

518
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,500
Like they found a release valve,
like he couldn't,

519
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,840
you couldn't be.
The Soviet Union was going to collapse

520
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:12,550
because it was,
it's a terrible system,

521
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:12,930
right.
Then,

522
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,661
you know,
economically,

523
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:14,620
politically,
whatever.

524
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,650
And China found this little bit of
balance where they still have the

525
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:21,700
repressive dictatorship,
but they give enough freedom for people

526
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:26,701
to be ambitious and try to get ahead and
that improves the economy and they make

527
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:28,090
some terrible mistakes.

528
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,170
Right.
They're these huge cities that are

529
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:30,190
built.
No one lives there.

530
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,040
And there's these spooky pictures.
Right.

531
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,370
So you've seen the recreations of other
large cities like Paris.

532
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,570
I've seen that.
And sometimes like cities like Shenzhen,

533
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:43,570
like right next to Hong Kong,
it's a city of 5 million people.

534
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,820
Thirty years ago it was 50,000 people,
right?

535
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,410
Like it just,
they built it in a couple of years and,

536
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,520
and other places like,
oh,

537
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:53,090
we'll build a shopping mall here where
there's nothing.

538
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,400
It's just instantly,
it's,

539
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,480
it looks like Detroit the next day.
There's no one there knew.

540
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,770
No one makes a,
no one builds anything.

541
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:02,860
No one does anything with it because
it's not really capitalism.

542
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,300
It's still a planned economy.
And there's pluses and minuses with

543
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,134
that.
No doubt.

544
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:12,060
One of the big fears about China is
there experimentation with genetics is

545
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,310
a,
they're willing to do things ethically

546
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,840
that scientists in America and a lot of
parts of the western world are not

547
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,520
willing to engage in yet.
Yeah.

548
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,730
Including the use of Crispr on human
embryos.

549
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,870
Yep.
And I think,

550
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,700
uh,
so I have mixed feelings about that.

551
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:29,380
I think it's going to happen in our
culture.

552
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,390
I think we're going to do it right.
I actually had.

553
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,180
I'm sorry I haven't released that
podcast yet,

554
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,910
but stay tuned.
I have an excellent podcast coming with

555
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:39,060
Carl Zimmer,
who was a science writer,

556
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,460
just wrote a long book about heredity
and genetics and uh,

557
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:45,380
yeah,
so what they're going to be doing a with

558
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:45,980
the designer

559
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,900
babies.
It's not science fiction as far as I can

560
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:52,370
tell it's going to happen and uh,
but it's very unclear what it will mean

561
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:56,030
because we're not any good right now.
And figuring out how genetics turns,

562
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,010
how your DNA turns into a person,
right?

563
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,930
Yeah.
It might be like,

564
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:01,970
you know,
that we find something other that if you

565
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:05,240
increase,
if you change this particular gene,

566
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,160
uh,
sure you can live twice as long,

567
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:09,500
but also you'll have Parkinson's disease
when you're fortunate,

568
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:10,460
right?
Like we don't know what the

569
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:12,290
interdependencies are and stuff like
that.

570
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:13,790
Uh,
so,

571
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,990
but,
but it's coming.

572
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:20,010
I think that the idea that we will be
choosing embryos to come to term and be

573
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:25,640
people on the basis of their jeans
before they're,

574
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,270
you know,
a implanted in the uterus is,

575
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,630
is 100 percent that's going to happen.
And the chance that we're gonna be

576
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,600
editing them is 99 point nine,
nine percent chance.

577
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,170
And you're right,
China is way more willing to do that.

578
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,840
And again,
I'm not really sure if that's good or

579
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:42,291
bad,
you know,

580
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:45,140
I think it's going to come here.
What I'm more worried about is that,

581
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:47,540
you know,
people figure out a system that will

582
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:51,170
make a,
you can have a baby who's guaranteed to

583
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:52,004
be,
you know,

584
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,990
tall and beautiful and smart and live
for a hundred 50 years and it'll cost

585
00:24:56,991 --> 00:25:00,950
you a million dollars,
then that'll be a little bit unfair.

586
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,350
Right.
That'll be an issue that will come up.

587
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,040
Yeah.
But then isn't it unfair that the rock

588
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,320
is the rock?
How did he get to be the rock?

589
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,980
It is,
but I think just psychologically it's a.

590
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:16,520
I think he worked hard,
but he also had his giant started.

591
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:17,870
Yeah,
he started in the right place.

592
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,940
You know the story of Almay,
right?

593
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,870
No.
Good.

594
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,120
So yeah,
being the basketball player from China,

595
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,300
he was basically the result of a
breeding program really.

596
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:29,720
Like they encouraged his parents who
were both really tall basketball players

597
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:32,570
to have a baby and you know,
it worked for him.

598
00:25:32,571 --> 00:25:34,340
It doesn't always work because it's a
crap shoot.

599
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,050
But uh,
um,

600
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,831
it can work.
Yeah.

601
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:39,050
And so,
but that's normal breeding.

602
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,650
That's like a dog.
And my dog's a good looking dog.

603
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,230
Her dog at the same breed,
let's put them together.

604
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,520
That's right.
With human beings.

605
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:47,990
But yes.
Otherwise normal.

606
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,690
Yes.
And it,

607
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,000
it,
I think it's different.

608
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,540
It's different psychologically because
we think it's different winning the

609
00:25:56,541 --> 00:26:01,541
lottery than already being rich and
therefore being able to afford something

610
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:03,740
that changes who you are.
Right.

611
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,090
I think that,
I don't know,

612
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:07,010
maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe people will think that that's

613
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,900
awesome.
And will these people will be

614
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,270
celebrities and we'll follow them on
instagram,

615
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:16,271
but I suspect people be rubbed the wrong
way at that kind of access to something

616
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:19,010
that most people can't afford it most
certainly will.

617
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,210
The most certainly.
Well,

618
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,550
but I think if you look at it
objectively,

619
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:25,310
if you look at the interactions of the
species,

620
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:28,880
as you know,
a completely a outside observer,

621
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,010
you would say not only is this
inevitable,

622
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:35,780
but this is going to lead to some really
spectacular changes in what a human

623
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:39,440
being is like.
Think about a big part of what we're

624
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:42,350
concerned with constantly on a daily
basis is healthcare,

625
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,340
right?
People were very concerned

626
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,790
with people that have to deal with
debilitating diseases and if we could

627
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:49,100
just eliminate all those.
Yeah.

628
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,820
Why wouldn't you want that?
I think you probably will be able to,

629
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,200
and it will probably happen.
That I think is.

630
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,810
Yeah,
but then so far almost everyone agrees

631
00:26:57,811 --> 00:26:59,610
with that.
Like it's not the controversial part,

632
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:00,151
right?
Like yeah,

633
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:04,020
if we can eliminate,
and apparently some diseases we already

634
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:06,930
know like right there in your DNA,
you're going to get Huntington's when

635
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:07,890
you're 40 years old.
Right?

636
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,340
And so those are easy to eliminate
peanut allergies or something like that

637
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,070
to other diseases are harder.
We don't know what causes them,

638
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:16,290
so it'll take time,
but I think that there'll be

639
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:19,860
uncontroversial if you could just remove
diseases from people ahead of time.

640
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,670
It's a little bit different if you're
choosing their hair color and skin color

641
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:26,250
and shape of their nose and feed and
whatever.

642
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,790
That gets a little squirrelly,
but it's also when the idea of it being

643
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:37,870
a cost prohibitive issue.
Well isn't that the case with almost all

644
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,910
technology as it emerges?
It's very memorable.

645
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,810
Plasma Tvs,
we're like $20,000 for a small

646
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:47,850
television.
I remember I saw them.

647
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:51,420
It was only like a 30 inch television or
something like that was exorbitant and I

648
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:52,680
was like,
this is incredible.

649
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:58,270
Flat hangs on the wall now.
Everybody has them and they're cheap.

650
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,800
You can get one for a few hundred bucks
and it's way bigger and way better than

651
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:03,090
what it was back then.
Yeah,

652
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:04,500
and I think they actually,
that's very realistic.

653
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,910
That maybe will be million dollars,
but then 10 years later we'll be

654
00:28:06,911 --> 00:28:09,870
$100,000 to sort of be a million dollars
first.

655
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,000
Right.
It kind of just like cell phones,

656
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:14,910
like everything else,
it has to be a really expensive thing

657
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:18,960
and then eventually trickles down like
cell phones and becomes available

658
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:19,950
everywhere to everybody.

659
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,050
Like if you look at the average person's
cell phone,

660
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,040
if you buy the cheap cell phone for like
300 bucks,

661
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,740
it is way better than an iphone from 10
years ago.

662
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,840
Yeah.
In every way.

663
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,370
Yeah.
No,

664
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,640
I think that's probably right.
And I think that it's one of the things

665
00:28:35,641 --> 00:28:36,600
that's happening,
like we're,

666
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,030
we're still at the beginning of
technology,

667
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,310
right?
Technology's not that advanced compared

668
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:43,110
to where it's going to be.
Um,

669
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,330
you know,
I have another podcast guests coming up

670
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:49,770
who is an expert on aging and how we can
fix that by messing with jeans a little

671
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,600
bit gray.
No,

672
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,110
no.
This was a real scientist at Princeton.

673
00:28:55,111 --> 00:28:56,750
You know,
someone who's just doing experimental

674
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,280
scientists.
Uh,

675
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,200
well he's,
I don't know him that well,

676
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:01,270
so I shouldn't say,
but I,

677
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,100
I think of it as an advocate for anti
aging,

678
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,420
which is good,
which is cool.

679
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,840
But,
but my guest,

680
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,010
Colleen Murphy,
he's just like a biologist who was

681
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:13,140
working on things and discovered
something that was,

682
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,280
she's not trying that hard,
right?

683
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,020
Uh,
you knock out a certain gene in this

684
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:20,560
certain worm and it lived twice as long
and without any twoK ,

685
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:21,440
right?
Like,

686
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,870
it doesn't get old because it's
fascinating.

687
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,670
Like why do we die?
Why do we grow old?

688
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,660
It's not necessary.
Like you could design an organism that

689
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:33,930
doesn't get older.
It would die from random bad things.

690
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:36,990
You get hit on the head with a brick,
but you don't need to die.

691
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:42,290
The reality is that evolution programmed
aging and death into us because once we

692
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,260
have kids or once we've outlived our
reproductive lifespan,

693
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:49,180
we're not useful anymore.
So biology is once us to die.

694
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,193
And so that,
that,

695
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,360
in other words,
it's potentially fixable.

696
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,440
You know,
it might not be easy,

697
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:55,270
it might be not happened 100 years from
now,

698
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:56,104
but it could.

699
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,060
So I think that,
you know,

700
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,250
aging,
genetic engineering,

701
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,220
brain,
computer interfaces,

702
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,920
you know,
all that stuff is going to within the

703
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,960
next hundred years totally changed what
it means to be human being and we're

704
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:11,290
totally not ready for it.
And so I was saying this to Carl

705
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,950
[inaudible] Carl's like,
not that Carl Zimmer was more or less

706
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:16,280
sanguine about is like don't worry,
just,

707
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,470
you know,
we'll put regulations on,

708
00:30:17,471 --> 00:30:19,510
it'll be fine.
And my attitude was,

709
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:21,910
no,
actually we should think of the absolute

710
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:24,910
craziest science fiction scenarios
because I want to be prepared,

711
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:25,270
right.
You know,

712
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:29,020
it doesn't come to pass.
I want to worry about the least probable

713
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:33,070
things because it might spark something
that actually helps us down the road.

714
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,510
Yeah.
There was a recent discovery.

715
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:38,920
They figured out a way to shut off
whatever it is that causes wrinkles and

716
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:42,460
reverse the process.
So whatever is causing your skin to get

717
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:45,490
wrinkly and sag,
they're reversing that process.

718
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,520
We might be members of the last
generation to die

719
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,320
of old age.
We won't be a mortal.

720
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,070
Well then if you thought you were
immortal,

721
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,771
if you thought,
well,

722
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,910
let's say that you thought that your
average lifespan was a million years,

723
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:00,040
would you suddenly become way more
cautious?

724
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,220
Oh,
start jumping off buildings and shit

725
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,260
would do.
Like I have a friend of mine who does

726
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,620
the flying squirrel suit stuff.
He holds the world.

727
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:10,330
You don't become vulnerable.
You just don't.

728
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,020
Exactly.
Flying Squirrels type is truly

729
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:14,890
dangerous.
Oh,

730
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:16,140
it's super dangerous.
Yeah.

731
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,560
Base jump.
What if they could just fix you if you

732
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,040
like even,
but that's a separate thing.

733
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,060
Yes,
that's possible.

734
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,180
Right?
Like maybe they get back to your go

735
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,290
back,
you up,

736
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,210
you just die,
but they build to your clone,

737
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,410
put you back together.
Like all these crazy science fiction

738
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:30,460
series.
I don't think that that's.

739
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,460
I think the backing up is way harder
than people think,

740
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,850
but I think that stopping aging is way
easier than people think.

741
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,280
But we'll see.
I agree with you.

742
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,960
Uh,
I went to the 20,

743
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:44,200
45,
I think they're calling it a conference

744
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:48,570
in New York City a few years back ago.
It's all the ray Kurzweil advocates that

745
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:51,630
think you're going to download brains
into computers and stuff.

746
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,840
Not that compelling like that,
that stuff.

747
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:57,740
I was like,
what are you going to do with what's

748
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,370
going to happen?
It seems like everybody had this idea of

749
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:03,790
one day we'll be able to do this and
we'll be able to take consciousness,

750
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:04,870
and I'm like,
yeah,

751
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,520
it's not.
I mean a,

752
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,150
b doesn't violate the laws of physics,
but it's hopelessly impractical compared

753
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:12,520
to anything we can do right now.
Like the human brain is just not

754
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:15,400
something you can read out.
My question,

755
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,760
and this was something that really
concerned me was what's to keep someone

756
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:22,180
from making hundreds of thousands of
versions of themselves?

757
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,390
Like what if,
what to take someone from some,

758
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,850
you know,
really rich billionaire character that

759
00:32:27,851 --> 00:32:31,120
can afford to do this and say,
I'm going to do this many,

760
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:33,450
many times.
Then I'm going to have my clones make

761
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:37,330
clones of clones and I'm going to fill
up a whole island with me.

762
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,070
Why would you do that though?
Because you're a crazy person.

763
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:40,611
Okay.
I mean,

764
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:42,170
crazy.
People are allowed to do crazy things,

765
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,280
but imagine if you had 100 Sean
Carroll's near House working on things

766
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:48,530
but it,
but they're not the same person.

767
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,930
What if you found that the 30,
the Sean Carroll Smoking crack and

768
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:57,730
hookers drawing fast direction.
Imagine.

769
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,720
Have you realized that that like after a
while there,

770
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,690
there is a random.
Sure,

771
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,070
yeah.
Is Evo Devo,

772
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,050
right?
Did you grow up in matters?

773
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,520
That would be really fascinating if that
would be an excellent episode of black

774
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:16,790
mirror where someone clone themselves
and found out that a certain percentage

775
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:20,840
of the clowns were just fucking crazy or
they were the crazy one.

776
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,910
Right?
Like all the clones were very different

777
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:26,930
than them and they rolled seem to each
other or maybe having all those clones

778
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:30,530
somehow or another set something off in
them that made them crazy because they

779
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:33,380
were in competition with all these other
people that were exactly like them.

780
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,221
This is golden.
Yeah.

781
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,770
We should edit this out of the podcast
so we can write up this episode.

782
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:42,530
There's a real concern with messing with
biology in a way that's never been done

783
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:43,610
before.
Exactly,

784
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:46,820
and I think that the extent to which
it's coming is something we haven't

785
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:50,150
quite faced up to you and it's really
coming.

786
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:53,450
It's coming fast and profoundly and
we're not ready.

787
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,750
Yeah.
And the possibility of just creating a

788
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:02,840
world that we're not prepared for and
we're not prepared for the consequences

789
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:03,530
of.
Yeah,

790
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,363
exactly.

791
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,280
All in favor of thinking crazy.
Right?

792
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,860
Like just wondering what it will be like
even if the answer is no,

793
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:11,480
that'll never happen.
At least,

794
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:12,830
you know,
be prepared a little bit.

795
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,521
Uh,
you know,

796
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:14,470
think of all the alarms.

797
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,770
Crazy scenarios.
Yeah.

798
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,680
Um,
have you really gotten into crispr?

799
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:21,480
Have you really looked into that stuff
at all?

800
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,070
Not that much,
you know,

801
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,890
a little too applied to real world for
my taste,

802
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,200
but people don't know what we're talking
about.

803
00:34:28,201 --> 00:34:32,010
We're talking,
it's a new technique for editing genes

804
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:37,250
that was discovered accidentally while
examining the effects of the story is

805
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:37,320
it's

806
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,240
amazing.
I mean there are these bacteria,

807
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,103
you know,
so we,

808
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,610
here's the thing,
we think of DNA as where our genetic

809
00:34:44,611 --> 00:34:45,900
information is stored,
right?

810
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:49,170
Like you have a little code,
it's a little list of symbols,

811
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:53,070
a cgt and their inner hero and that's
it.

812
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:55,470
That is handed down from parents to
children,

813
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,150
but the reality is way more complicated
than that because different parts of the

814
00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:04,010
DNA do things and different ones don't.
Some of them get turned on,

815
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,410
turned off.
We have mitochondrial DNA which are not

816
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,380
our DNA.
We had these little sub cells within us

817
00:35:10,381 --> 00:35:15,381
that get carried along for the ride and
have their own DNA and so crispr is this

818
00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:17,830
thing that was invented by nature,
right?

819
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:22,910
Not by human beings.
These bacteria who were trying to resist

820
00:35:23,101 --> 00:35:24,270
viruses.
Right?

821
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,470
So the viruses would come in and attack
them and basically the de,

822
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,500
the bacteria learned away to steel part
of the DNA of the virus and keep it as

823
00:35:35,221 --> 00:35:36,930
like a facial recognition software.

824
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,550
It's like a template.
Like,

825
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,010
Oh,
this DNA thing is approaching me that's

826
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:42,600
a virus and I should attack it.
Right?

827
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,480
Like this is something that I knew.
I learned how to fight off.

828
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,410
And so to do that need to be able to
snip out a little piece of DNA.

829
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,980
And so scientists,
biologists learned that they could

830
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,940
train,
this is a little bit fanciful way,

831
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,770
putting it metaphorical,
but they could train the bacteria to go

832
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:01,470
in there,
snip out pieces of DNA,

833
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:03,120
and you can do that for any dna you
want.

834
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,530
So,
but,

835
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,430
and you can replace it with something
else.

836
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,940
Uh,
it's not really very high precision

837
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:10,500
right now,
but that's coming.

838
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,930
And so in principle,
this is,

839
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:16,980
you know,
a little way to change the genetic code

840
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:20,790
and then they figured out some other way
that ordinarily,

841
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,270
right,
if you have two parents and you have

842
00:36:24,271 --> 00:36:27,900
like Brown eyes versus blue eyes and
blue eyes are recessive.

843
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,420
So they both need to have the blue eye
gene to give you if you want to have

844
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,850
blue eyes.
But they figured out a way that you can

845
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:36,750
change the DNA and it automatically with
100 percent accuracy gets sent to all of

846
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:38,220
your offspring,
right?

847
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:41,250
It's not 50 slash 50 chance or whatever.
Uh,

848
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:44,820
so then you can just say,
propagate a change in the genetic code

849
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:46,650
throughout the species pretty darn
quickly.

850
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,450
And your human beings take a long time
to breed.

851
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:50,700
But animals and plants,
it's a whole nother world,

852
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,990
right?
You can design those very,

853
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:55,890
very rapidly and there's already been at
least one revision of the process,

854
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:57,570
right?
I think so,

855
00:36:57,571 --> 00:36:58,300
but yeah.
The.

856
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,120
I think I just told you everything I
know

857
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,360
continuing to improve on the process and
it's really,

858
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,320
it's really gonna be very interesting to
see where that goes as far as that

859
00:37:09,321 --> 00:37:10,430
advances.
Yeah.

860
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:13,400
I think this was a concern with places
like China,

861
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,020
right?
They're already doing this.

862
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,890
They're already manipulating genetics
and trying to create super people

863
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,400
and I think that the chances that gives
them a great basketball team or greater

864
00:37:22,401 --> 00:37:24,890
than the chances that it gave them a
bunch of brilliant phd scientist.

865
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,520
Well that's where it starts,
right in.

866
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,630
A lot of it starts in competitive
athletics.

867
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,910
Have you paid attention?
Did you watch the documentary?

868
00:37:30,911 --> 00:37:32,020
ICARUS?
No,

869
00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:34,060
I did not.
Fascinating documentary that's on

870
00:37:34,061 --> 00:37:39,010
Netflix right now about it's.
It really is kind of a crazy set of

871
00:37:39,011 --> 00:37:41,500
circumstances.
There's a guy named Bryan Fogel,

872
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:46,501
he's the director of the producer of the
movie and he was competitive bike racer

873
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:51,370
and he decided to document what he
wanted to do was compete in a race,

874
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:54,040
a bike race,
a hundred percent clean,

875
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,700
and then get a Russian scientist to
juice them up.

876
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:01,630
So in the process of getting this
Russian scientists to juice them up,

877
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:06,870
he stumbled upon a scandal and in the
middle of him making that,

878
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:13,190
but it means in a crazy way because this
Russian guy is the head of the Anti

879
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,720
Doping Agency in Russia and it was just
sort of informing him how you would do

880
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:17,260
this.

881
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,210
So he teaches him and forms of how you
can do this.

882
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:24,010
While this is all going on.
It turns out that the Russians had

883
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:29,011
completely cheated their way through the
Sochi Olympics now and it was all

884
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:31,630
documented and so they were getting
busted.

885
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,040
As this is all going on and he films
this Russian who's the head of it,

886
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:40,180
escaping Russia,
barely coming to the United States and

887
00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:45,181
being chased and testifying all the
different strategies that the Russians

888
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:50,281
used in order to completely cheat on,
like at least one entire Olympic team,

889
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,720
like every single athlete was on drugs
and they had a record number of gold

890
00:38:55,721 --> 00:39:00,721
medals and so then he starts detailing
the process and how they did it and they

891
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:05,110
use forensic test,
examined the urine bottles and showed

892
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:08,690
that they've been opened even though
they were supposedly not openable and

893
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,630
really,
really interesting stuff,

894
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,900
but that national pride,
the thing about a national pride and you

895
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:16,421
know,
the,

896
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:21,400
the ability to win a bunch of gold
medals and athletic dominance is so

897
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:25,990
important for the morale of,
of these countries that want to

898
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:27,400
establish superiority,

899
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,231
right?
Yeah.

900
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:29,850
And there are some people who say,
well,

901
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:33,150
let's just go for it.
Let's have the old dope Olympics.

902
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:35,280
Right?
Like people enhance themselves as much

903
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:39,900
as they possibly can.
And there's an ongoing debate about what

904
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:42,180
about people who use prosthetics,
right?

905
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:45,210
Is that fair?
If you lost a leg and you have a

906
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:47,460
prosthetic leg,
because could that potentially give you

907
00:39:47,461 --> 00:39:50,220
an advantage in a running event or
something like that?

908
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,370
If it were a sufficiently good
prosthetic eye?

909
00:39:52,371 --> 00:39:54,360
I don't know the answer to any of these
questions.

910
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:58,980
I think it's a little bit weird because
we set up these arbitrary categories for

911
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:00,930
what is it,
a sporting event and we invented them,

912
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,460
right?
They're not out there in the world and

913
00:40:02,461 --> 00:40:06,420
now we're faced with wholly different
circumstances to what to do about it,

914
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,731
but yeah,
I think that,

915
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:08,530
you know,
there's.

916
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,020
There's the question of what we should
do,

917
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:12,030
which is hard.
There's the question of what's going to

918
00:40:12,031 --> 00:40:13,860
happen,
which is it's all going to happen.

919
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,510
All of these things are gonna happen.

920
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,400
I was talking to a guy this past weekend
who's a navy seal and his friend lost

921
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:24,401
his hand and they gave him a new hand
and they're working on this new handout

922
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,760
that's going to allow him to play piano.
So it's a completely artificial carbon

923
00:40:30,951 --> 00:40:34,730
fiber hand with all these different
things that attach directly to your

924
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:38,050
nerves and somehow or another he can
control it with

925
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,510
his arm that's going to allow him to
play piano and you're going to tell me

926
00:40:41,511 --> 00:40:42,880
that he could never play the piano
before.

927
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,360
Right now he knows it's in the.
It's in the thing.

928
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,194
It's.
Yeah.

929
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,720
Well this is what I was saying about the
brain computer interfaces.

930
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:54,721
I think that's the real.
That's even bigger frontier than

931
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,510
synthetic biology or genetic engineering
because computers are really useful for

932
00:40:58,511 --> 00:41:00,220
things.
Robots are very useful for things.

933
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,850
Human beings are just going to sort of
blend in.

934
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,350
It's not like we're gonna have ai and
super healthy humans.

935
00:41:05,351 --> 00:41:07,510
It's,
we're gonna just have everywhere on that

936
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,130
spectrum.
Yeah,

937
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:11,170
that's what I'm thinking as well.
There's going to be some sort of a

938
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:15,580
symbiotic thing like a chip or you know,
they tried it with the Google glasses.

939
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,950
Could try to get people to wear that.
But they were goofy.

940
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,821
Yeah.
I put them on.

941
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:22,930
They felt too science fictiony.
Just like the first portable phones were

942
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:23,850
these giant things.
Right?

943
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,710
That doesn't matter.
Right.

944
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,010
That's not a longterm prognostication
tool.

945
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:28,180
Yeah.
Lots of,

946
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:30,910
uh,
lots of people are working on it.

947
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,010
Elan Musk has a little company that no
one knows,

948
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,090
uh,
that

949
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,300
as they do now.
Yeah.

950
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,740
Well,
people know about it if they care,

951
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:38,420
but it's not like one of his famous
ones,

952
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,800
right.
Um,

953
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,700
to,
to implant a neural lace or something in

954
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,130
your body that reads your brain neuro
lace.

955
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:49,730
I don't like the way that sounds.
Whereas if you want a more macho,

956
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,920
wanted the back of your head to open up
your schedule.

957
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,920
But I didn't think of it as I was
thinking of it as like a mesh.

958
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,833
Yeah,
that's what,

959
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,890
that's.
It just seems creepy that it's going to

960
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,650
latch onto your nerves and improve you.
Yeah.

961
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,340
Neuro lace.
You won't need your phone anymore.

962
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,850
Wow.
And where's you went to the back of your

963
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:12,410
head?
Everyone goes to the back of their head

964
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,393
will always go.
Well,

965
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,190
I
mean,

966
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,300
like the Matrix.
Everybody goes to the back of their

967
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:20,134
head.
Yeah.

968
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,070
I mean,
right now,

969
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:24,050
uh,
companies that want to make money in the

970
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:26,960
short term are building these
nonsurgical,

971
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:30,020
noninvasive things we like were
something on the front of your head or

972
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,230
wear a cap or something like that,
which can detect frequencies,

973
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,900
vibrations in your brain and you can,
it's very primitive,

974
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:39,830
but you can move things around,
you can control drones with your brain

975
00:42:39,831 --> 00:42:40,910
without touching anything.

976
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,500
Uh,
but yeah,

977
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:44,750
the,
if it ever becomes practical,

978
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:49,190
which is very far from certain,
but the thing to imagine in the far

979
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,700
outside fiction scenario is cracking
open your skull and inserting some

980
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:54,710
electrodes in their,
closing it back up.

981
00:42:54,711 --> 00:42:59,330
And now you're part of the Super
Internet without doing anything more

982
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:00,400
than closing your eyes.
Yeah.

983
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,980
And there's also the possibility of
enhancing various,

984
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,890
uh,
thought processes to with transdermal

985
00:43:06,891 --> 00:43:09,040
stimulation.
Like if they could figure out,

986
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,850
you know,
they're doing that now they're,

987
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:15,170
they've performed a series of tests
where they have people do like certain

988
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:20,171
tasks and then they put electrodes in a
certain areas of the brain and put an

989
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:23,840
electric charge.
And that electric charge stimulates

990
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:28,130
various aspects of the brain and it
allows them to complete certain tasks

991
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:30,500
quicker and more efficiently.
You know,

992
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:33,470
I think,
and this is just a kind of uninformed a

993
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,680
belief,
but I suspect that the human brain is

994
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,290
pretty optimized for what it tries to
do.

995
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,450
I think that rather than improving the
brainers,

996
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:44,000
stimulating it the way forward is to
augment it,

997
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,330
like hook it up to calculators and
Internet and whatever.

998
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,390
You know,
one thing that I don't see talked about

999
00:43:50,391 --> 00:43:52,490
very much but I think will be a real
game changer.

1000
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,440
You know,
we talked about phones as if we're

1001
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:58,070
carrying around phones,
but we don't mostly use our phones to

1002
00:43:58,071 --> 00:43:59,780
talk to people on the phone.
Right?

1003
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:02,630
We check the email,
check the internet and we take pictures

1004
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,380
once you really have.
And again it might not be possible,

1005
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:10,730
but if you really had a direct
connection between your brain and the

1006
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,730
Internet,
your eyeballs are a video camera.

1007
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,140
Everything you see,
you can record and store somewhere,

1008
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,490
right?
So.

1009
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,660
And you can lend them to other people or
people can subpoena them or whatever.

1010
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,980
Like there's literally no place in the
world that,

1011
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,870
that human eyeballs are looking at that
would not be subject to later

1012
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:30,620
inspection.

1013
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,140
That is weird and scary and bad.
Right?

1014
00:44:33,141 --> 00:44:35,520
It is words carrying bad.
And what if someone comes up with a

1015
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:37,190
better eyeball?
Oh yeah.

1016
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:42,060
Scoop out your old doll eyes and put in
some new awesome ones that you can

1017
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:43,170
record with.
Yeah,

1018
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,640
absolutely.
Yeah.

1019
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,190
I don't think that a nest.
I think,

1020
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,700
I think I absolutely agree that
enhancing it with electronics is

1021
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:53,280
probably the way to go and that having
some sort of,

1022
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,610
some sort of symbiotic relationship with
electronics.

1023
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:01,140
But I also think that this transdermal
stimulation can enhance that process on

1024
00:45:01,141 --> 00:45:03,030
top of it.
I think there's going to be a bunch of

1025
00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:07,710
different things going on at once.
You won't even think about crispr being

1026
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:12,060
something where someone eventually
figures out a way to design various

1027
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:17,061
aspects of the human brain that are more
open to interface with technology,

1028
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:22,340
changing various receptors,
make them more efficient for data to go

1029
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:23,940
straight to the dome.

1030
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,010
Yeah.
And I think that,

1031
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,880
uh,
there is a short term versus long term

1032
00:45:26,881 --> 00:45:27,631
question here,
right?

1033
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:30,840
Like even if what I said is a longterm
truth on the short term,

1034
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:34,980
improving our thinking skills in direct
ways with stimulation or whatever sounds

1035
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,710
pretty good.
But maybe you can just do that through

1036
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,930
Beta blockers.
There are some drugs or something like

1037
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:41,910
that.
Like I think that that's another thing,

1038
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,710
very plausible that will have safe
superefficient drugs.

1039
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,610
Someone can take it over the next six
hours,

1040
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:50,940
their way.
Clear thinkers than they were before.

1041
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:56,410
Is there any concern with what's the end
game like what's all this stuff?

1042
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,390
I hope so.
I mean,

1043
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:01,600
if you're a super far advanced,
the end game is you realize that life is

1044
00:46:01,601 --> 00:46:04,540
not that interesting.
Yeah.

1045
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,730
You're like,
well why am I here?

1046
00:46:05,731 --> 00:46:08,910
What am I doing with all this little
challenge is helpful actually.

1047
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,820
Well in particular if you develop a
mortality,

1048
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,460
yeah.
If there's no concern about getting

1049
00:46:14,461 --> 00:46:17,320
injured or killed.
Yeah.

1050
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:22,550
I think that people who envision super
far ahead science fiction scenarios and

1051
00:46:23,431 --> 00:46:28,431
especially people who envision uploading
brains and consciousness underestimate

1052
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:33,900
the importance of our bodies to who we
are as human beings,

1053
00:46:33,901 --> 00:46:35,790
right?
Not just that we're in a body,

1054
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:38,580
but like hunger,
thirst,

1055
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,190
exhaustion,
being horny,

1056
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:45,900
like these are motivating factors that
really affect who we are and what we say

1057
00:46:45,901 --> 00:46:47,640
and what we do and if you remove all
that,

1058
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:50,790
if you're just a thinking processor in a
computer,

1059
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,250
what's your motivation?
Why are you going on?

1060
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:54,780
Right?
Like what are you doing anything at all?

1061
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:57,390
Like I don't think it'll be.
I don't think it will be anything like

1062
00:46:57,391 --> 00:46:59,490
the personality,
the person who you are.

1063
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,060
If your body is taken away.
That's the big question about artificial

1064
00:47:03,061 --> 00:47:03,631
life,
right?

1065
00:47:03,631 --> 00:47:08,631
Our or artificial intelligence rather
like what we have very specific needs

1066
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,840
that are addressed by our ambitions,
right?

1067
00:47:12,841 --> 00:47:17,280
Biological need,
the idea of transferring your genes,

1068
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:18,920
keeping your,
your bloodline,

1069
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:19,830
going,
all that stuff.

1070
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,060
There's all these survival instincts
that we have that you necessarily

1071
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,070
wouldn't necessarily have if you are an
artificial life form.

1072
00:47:27,071 --> 00:47:29,040
Like why would you care if someone
pulled the plug on you?

1073
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,010
Why would you try to

1074
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,850
survive?
What do you.

1075
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:31,960
What's your purpose here?
Right.

1076
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,940
Exact same sort of futile.
If you're.

1077
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:38,520
There's a lot of talk in the Ai,
a existential risk community,

1078
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:40,380
like worrying about artificial
intelligence,

1079
00:47:40,381 --> 00:47:45,180
about value alignment,
like making sure that the ais value the

1080
00:47:45,181 --> 00:47:47,970
same things that we do.
Like our existence for example,

1081
00:47:47,971 --> 00:47:48,630
right?
Yeah,

1082
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,460
and,
but I think a little bit,

1083
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:52,620
at least what I hear,
and I'm not an expert,

1084
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:56,820
but I hear it seems a little bit off the
mark because they're talking about what

1085
00:47:56,821 --> 00:48:01,821
to program into the AI,
but if it's in any sense really an ai,

1086
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,530
it can reprogram itself,
right?

1087
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,840
You can change your mind as a human
being.

1088
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:09,570
You can change your values.
You can change your motivations.

1089
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,740
Artificial intelligence is should be
able to do the same thing and in fact

1090
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,890
they better be able to do that if
they're going to be truly intelligent.

1091
00:48:16,891 --> 00:48:18,480
If they're.
If we're going to mimic what a human

1092
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:19,820
being can do,
a,

1093
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,050
it can't be something where we
programmed them,

1094
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,240
just do a task because that's not
intelligent.

1095
00:48:24,241 --> 00:48:26,740
Right?
So if that happens there,

1096
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:29,970
then you know who knows what they're
going to eventually be motivated to do.

1097
00:48:29,971 --> 00:48:31,110
If anything,
like you said,

1098
00:48:31,111 --> 00:48:34,350
like what is their motivation even to do
anything at all or even to exist?

1099
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,560
Well isn't.
One of the big concerns is that in

1100
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:41,700
releasing artificial technology and
giving it autonomy that we're going to

1101
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:46,701
do is like start a process that some
sort of a perpetual exponential domino

1102
00:48:49,981 --> 00:48:54,981
effect of technology where this new
artificial life is going to create

1103
00:48:54,991 --> 00:48:58,140
better artificial life which creates
better artificial life,

1104
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,200
which expands to godlike powers within a
very short period of time and decides

1105
00:49:03,661 --> 00:49:08,070
where he's stupid and useless and just
eliminates us and then it gets bored and

1106
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:08,940
shuts itself off.
Yeah.

1107
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,990
He goes,
what are we doing here?

1108
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:13,170
The Sun's going to burn out and these
are hard

1109
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:16,730
things to even extrapolate because
they're so far beyond our experience,

1110
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:21,731
but I do think that we're opening up
doors that we never had before.

1111
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,640
Between between a genetic modifications
of human beings,

1112
00:49:25,641 --> 00:49:28,130
artificial intelligence,
brain computer interfaces,

1113
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,101
uh,
we,

1114
00:49:29,101 --> 00:49:33,500
we don't have the experience or the
capacity to really even ask the right

1115
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:34,730
questions about these things.

1116
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,540
Right?
We're sort of rudimentary.

1117
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:41,550
Early were rudimentary idea.
The idea is that we have of like what is

1118
00:49:43,591 --> 00:49:47,880
necessary or really based on our own
biological needs.

1119
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,730
We have family.
We want to keep everybody healthy,

1120
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,240
we enjoy our community,
we want to keep it safe.

1121
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,480
We enjoy our,
our earth who want to keep it clean.

1122
00:49:57,481 --> 00:50:00,660
We want to,
we want to save things for the future

1123
00:50:00,661 --> 00:50:04,710
generations and all these concerns that
we have that are very biological,

1124
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,380
they just won't exist for artificial
life.

1125
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:10,250
That's exactly right.
And I think that what we're really good

1126
00:50:10,251 --> 00:50:13,850
at or what we're better at in terms of
imagining the future is taking what

1127
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:15,970
already exists and just expanding it,
right?

1128
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,960
Like,
so when people.

1129
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,480
I think that maybe you talked about this
in the last podcast,

1130
00:50:20,481 --> 00:50:24,860
but uh,
when people first started imagining

1131
00:50:24,861 --> 00:50:29,240
mechanical devices to carry you around
mechanical transportation in the late 18

1132
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:32,390
hundreds,
they imagined a mechanical horse cause

1133
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:33,860
they knew the horse has existed,
right?

1134
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,860
And the car was a totally different
thing and people hadn't thought of that

1135
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:38,810
originally.
And then when people did think of cars,

1136
00:50:38,811 --> 00:50:41,540
they thought of flying cars because they
solved there were flying animals,

1137
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:43,430
right?
And the flying cars haven't appeared

1138
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:45,800
because w,
w we didn't what they should have been

1139
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:48,830
thinking about it.
How are cars going to change our cities

1140
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,830
and our commutes and how we live,
right?

1141
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,330
Uh,
when people invented the Internet that

1142
00:50:53,331 --> 00:50:54,570
were,
they weren't sure what they were going

1143
00:50:54,571 --> 00:50:56,900
to do with it.
And I think that the same thing is true

1144
00:50:56,901 --> 00:50:57,734
when,
when,

1145
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,570
if we can imagine blending the barrier
between our biological existence in some

1146
00:51:02,571 --> 00:51:05,810
virtual existence,
we don't even know what questions to ask

1147
00:51:05,811 --> 00:51:06,270
about that.

1148
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:08,700
Yeah.
And I think we are getting close to

1149
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:10,230
those other things that you mentioned
though.

1150
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,440
Boston dynamics is getting really close
to artificial dogs and artificial

1151
00:51:15,481 --> 00:51:16,740
horses.
I mean,

1152
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:20,070
they have things that you can't kick,
you kick them and they,

1153
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:21,900
they don't get knocked over and open
doors.

1154
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:25,200
Yes.
They can jump like incredible distances,

1155
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,830
incredible heights.
Um,

1156
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,920
there's,
there's some amazing ones that do

1157
00:51:28,921 --> 00:51:31,350
acrobatics now.
We've seen that where they're going to

1158
00:51:31,351 --> 00:51:36,270
replace stuntman in movies that could
potentially get harmed with these robots

1159
00:51:36,271 --> 00:51:41,040
that can do crazy back flips and jump
off buildings and the next big war is

1160
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:43,410
going to look very,
very different than very weird.

1161
00:51:43,411 --> 00:51:44,820
Right.
That's,

1162
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:47,280
hopefully it won't happen,
but if it does,

1163
00:51:47,281 --> 00:51:48,030
yeah,
it's gonna.

1164
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:51,750
There's a big emphasis on automated
things.

1165
00:51:51,751 --> 00:51:55,500
Not just drones,
but physical things that are running

1166
00:51:55,501 --> 00:51:57,590
around on the grass and make decisions
that.

1167
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,330
Give it a little bit of Ai.
Then.

1168
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:01,530
Do you watch dark mirror?
Uh,

1169
00:52:01,531 --> 00:52:02,331
I haven't seen it,
you know,

1170
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:06,300
does it make in my queue?
There's an insane episode on.

1171
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,820
Do you remember the name of it?
The one with Black Mirror,

1172
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,290
black mirror.
That's a dark mirror.

1173
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,040
Black Mirror is insane episode on these
little robots that are chasing metal

1174
00:52:16,981 --> 00:52:19,080
face,
metal head,

1175
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:20,640
something like that.
Yeah,

1176
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,960
it's about a robots chasing after this
lady.

1177
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,560
And it's,
it literally is these little tiny Boston

1178
00:52:28,561 --> 00:52:31,620
dynamic robots,
but they can kill you and they're there

1179
00:52:31,621 --> 00:52:35,430
on a mission and this is not outside the
realm of possibility at all.

1180
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:36,060
Nope.

1181
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,950
It really isn't.
And like I said,

1182
00:52:37,951 --> 00:52:39,900
it's,
we don't even know.

1183
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:44,370
It's easy to extrapolate right ahead.
Just ordered the Sarah differences.

1184
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:45,263
There it is.

1185
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,020
That's from the episode.
It's a fantastic episode two.

1186
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,120
There's so many good episodes of that
show.

1187
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,040
Black Mirror is just amazing.
Yeah.

1188
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:54,250
I guess start watched.
Um,

1189
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:56,400
but that,
that's a concern.

1190
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,050
I mean there's,
there's a real concern.

1191
00:52:58,051 --> 00:53:00,540
I mean we're,
we're doing it right now with drones,

1192
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,750
you know,
if you talk to people that are really,

1193
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,800
that have paid attention to studied
drone warfare and how incredibly

1194
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,980
inhumane it is and how different it is
from any other type of warfare in terms

1195
00:53:13,981 --> 00:53:18,981
of is like the ability to rationalize
targets when you're not there yet.

1196
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,580
And you're,
you have,

1197
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:26,250
you're nowhere near and you're just
pressing buttons and you decide

1198
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,770
like little bell does a very good
possibility.

1199
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:30,360
This person's in here.
Fuck it.

1200
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:31,630
Nuke the building.
Yeah.

1201
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:32,790
And we're,
I think we're doing that.

1202
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,170
Yes,
absolutely happening.

1203
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:36,660
But on the other hand,
the drones are also delivering pizzas.

1204
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,190
Are they though?
I got a pizza with a drone thing.

1205
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:43,680
So if you looked at the amount of people
that have delivered pizzas with drones

1206
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:45,870
versus the amount of people that have
been killed by drones,

1207
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,280
especially killing is bigger.
Well,

1208
00:53:47,281 --> 00:53:51,480
the innocence of the scariest drones are
really good at killing innocent people.

1209
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,260
Not so good at killing the people that
are specific target targets.

1210
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,390
But I think my,
my point is just that,

1211
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,670
uh,
there are going to be pluses and

1212
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:00,504
minuses,
right?

1213
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:02,880
So I think that it's going to change.
Like if we,

1214
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,140
if we combine this idea of,
you know,

1215
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:07,980
interfacing with computers with this
idea of drones,

1216
00:54:07,981 --> 00:54:10,230
doing some drugs,
rework with this idea of giving people a

1217
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:11,460
basic income.

1218
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,460
Everyone is just going to sit in their
rooms and then write on their.

1219
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:16,050
Tumblr is all day.
That's gonna be the future.

1220
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:17,790
I don't think they're going to be
writing anymore.

1221
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:22,791
I think this is a real possibility that
we're going to create virtual reality

1222
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,040
that's indistinguishable from regular
reality.

1223
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:27,810
And people are going to live in,
they're like ready player,

1224
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:31,470
one will be better kind of thing.
I think that the big flaw to me and

1225
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:34,230
things like trauma and are ready player
one is that they make the virtual

1226
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:35,970
reality look too much like the real
reality.

1227
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,820
There's no reason why virtual reality
has to have gravity.

1228
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,580
There's no reason why it has to be three
dimensional.

1229
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:45,690
There's no reason why.
You know you have any limit on how

1230
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:47,010
strong you are,
how fast you are,

1231
00:54:47,011 --> 00:54:47,840
and if.
Yeah,

1232
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,040
like there's no reason why you have to
have only one body.

1233
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:52,140
I mean there's a million different ways
in which it could be very,

1234
00:54:52,141 --> 00:54:52,771
very different.
Well,

1235
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:55,320
it also can be implemented with
something like the tank,

1236
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:57,210
the float tank that we were talking
about earlier.

1237
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:01,560
I mean you could climb into that float
tank with some sort of apparatus.

1238
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,750
Hook these gloves on,
put this helmet over,

1239
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:08,280
and literally not be subject to the
whims of gravity.

1240
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:11,100
You can't even feel it.
Effects of gravity will be

1241
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,670
inconsequential because you will feel
like you're floating.

1242
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,250
And then from there you'll be able to
fly around.

1243
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:18,720
And do all sorts of,
yeah,

1244
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:21,170
I think like this weird period between,
you know,

1245
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:26,240
the year 1900 and 2000 or 2000,
100 or whatever it's going to be a,

1246
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,720
it'll be a weird transitional period in
human history where we invented

1247
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:34,620
technology and not really put it to work
yet and there might be some equilibrium

1248
00:55:34,621 --> 00:55:38,610
that we reach and 100 or 200 years where
the whole mode of life is utterly

1249
00:55:38,611 --> 00:55:39,570
different than what it is now.

1250
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:44,040
If you could put priorities in terms of
like what you think people should

1251
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:48,810
concentrate on first when in regards to
this kind of stuff,

1252
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:52,020
what do you think those would be like if
someone said,

1253
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:53,310
Shawn,
you're a super smart dude.

1254
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,570
Let's,
uh,

1255
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:57,570
let's get on the ball here,
figure out what direction should we take

1256
00:55:57,571 --> 00:55:58,320
this in.
I mean,

1257
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,080
what I do for living is more like
foundational.

1258
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:02,420
What are the laws of physics kind of
thing.

1259
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,460
Right?
So I'm not the person to speculate on

1260
00:56:05,461 --> 00:56:06,294
this stuff,
but.

1261
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,410
Well,
I think,

1262
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:10,290
um,
this is why I said earlier like I think

1263
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:12,150
we should be talking to each other
because nobody is,

1264
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,150
no one person is right.
Like that's why we need to have people

1265
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:19,680
from different areas of expertise talk
about each other's areas if only then to

1266
00:56:19,681 --> 00:56:20,790
be corrected,
right?

1267
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,560
But you know,
to be open to that dialogue.

1268
00:56:22,561 --> 00:56:24,610
So I think that for example,

1269
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,270
an enormous amount of effort has been
put into nanotechnology building tiny

1270
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:32,110
little machines.
I suspect that mostly the real,

1271
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,580
uh,
advances,

1272
00:56:33,581 --> 00:56:35,250
they are not going to be in
nanotechnology,

1273
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,010
but in synthetic biology where you take
bacteria are multicellular organisms

1274
00:56:39,011 --> 00:56:41,710
that already exists and adapt them for
your purposes,

1275
00:56:41,711 --> 00:56:44,500
make them do whatever you want.
Because biology has already solved a lot

1276
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:48,340
of the problems that a technology is
still struggling to figure out.

1277
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,320
So the concept of nanotechnologies
you're going to take like almost like a

1278
00:56:51,321 --> 00:56:53,090
cell sized machine,
right?

1279
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:58,160
And many of them going to go into your
body and find areas that are damaged or

1280
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,390
whatever.
Yeah,

1281
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:04,980
there's a woman,
a professor at Caltech who gave a talk a

1282
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,990
few months ago about tea builds robots
out of DNA,

1283
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:11,650
so they're these little DNA robots can
go in and right now they're at the level

1284
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:15,900
where what they can do is sort thing.
So like if they have a molecule one and

1285
00:57:15,901 --> 00:57:18,030
molecule to scattered across some
surface,

1286
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:21,120
this little DNA robot will go in and
we've all molecule one to the left,

1287
00:57:21,121 --> 00:57:26,121
all of molecule due to the right and so
she says that's the beginning.

1288
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,370
Like in the future you'll have your
little DNA box and you'll say,

1289
00:57:29,371 --> 00:57:31,980
you know,
I'm allergic to tomatoes,

1290
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,460
and then it will invent a little machine
that will run through your body and fix

1291
00:57:35,461 --> 00:57:36,920
your allergy tomatoes.
Right?

1292
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:41,930
You don't need that anymore with a
machine with a DNA robots.

1293
00:57:42,141 --> 00:57:43,830
So it's literally.
So why DNA,

1294
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,630
because you think of DNA is carrying the
genetic code,

1295
00:57:45,631 --> 00:57:50,631
but DNA is a wonderful molecule because
it is relatively stable,

1296
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,320
but it's not just a crystal,
right?

1297
00:57:52,321 --> 00:57:54,240
It's not just doing the same thing over
and over again.

1298
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:57,540
So it contains information and it can
adapt.

1299
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:58,201
It can.
It can,

1300
00:57:58,201 --> 00:57:59,130
you know,
uh,

1301
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:02,250
hold on and grab onto certain things and
let go and,

1302
00:58:02,251 --> 00:58:05,730
and do things.
So DNA is a wonderful testing ground for

1303
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:09,510
building little really,
really tiny things in your body that

1304
00:58:09,511 --> 00:58:10,530
will change who you are.

1305
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:13,190
Here's a question that's not totally
related,

1306
00:58:13,191 --> 00:58:18,191
but you might be a good person for this.
What is quantum computing now?

1307
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:24,080
[inaudible] I keep hearing about this.
That's one of the big breakthroughs in,

1308
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,680
in computers is going to be quantum
computing,

1309
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:28,543
right?

1310
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,670
I'm almost the right guy.
I'm not completed the color.

1311
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:33,400
I actually did teach a course at Caltech
that involve quantum computing.

1312
00:58:33,401 --> 00:58:35,880
So I'm above average,
definitely the best,

1313
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:39,130
but yeah.
So,

1314
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:41,590
um,
so quantum mechanics,

1315
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,390
this is the book that I'm writing right
now,

1316
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:44,950
uh,
that's gonna be a year from now called

1317
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:48,010
something deeply hidden.
It'll be about quantum mechanics and the

1318
00:58:48,011 --> 00:58:50,950
goal of the book will be to make quantum
mechanics understandable to everybody

1319
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,980
and convinced them that quantum
mechanics really does imply the

1320
00:58:53,981 --> 00:58:57,670
existence of multiple worlds where
things look very much the same except

1321
00:58:57,671 --> 00:59:00,270
for tiny differences.
And one way of thinking that will

1322
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,310
quantum mechanics says is in classical
mechanics,

1323
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:04,720
which is what came before quantum
mechanics.

1324
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:08,440
Let's imagine you have a bit right?
That is something is either zero or one

1325
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,390
right?
One piece of information.

1326
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,650
In quantum mechanics,
you have a quantum bit accubid as they

1327
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,240
call it,
very clever.

1328
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,320
So the difference is that instead of it
being a zero or a one,

1329
00:59:20,321 --> 00:59:23,060
like it would be classically quantum,
mechanically,

1330
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:27,510
it is in some super position of zero and
one and some combination of a little bit

1331
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,640
zero,
a little bit one.

1332
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:31,670
And it's not that you don't know which
one it is,

1333
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:34,730
it's that it really is both.
It might be 90 percent zero and 10

1334
00:59:34,731 --> 00:59:39,731
percent one or something like that.
So take that fact number one fact number

1335
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:43,190
two is the quantum mechanics has the
thing called entanglement,

1336
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:47,450
which means that if you have two bits
classically,

1337
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:48,710
so you have zero,
zero,

1338
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:49,311
zero,
one,

1339
00:59:49,311 --> 00:59:50,480
one zero,
one,

1340
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:52,040
one,
four different possibilities.

1341
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:57,170
So quantum mechanics says it's not that
this one bit is in a combination of zero

1342
00:59:57,171 --> 00:59:59,180
and one,
and this other bit is also in a

1343
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:03,620
combination of zero and one,
it's that the two bit system is in a

1344
01:00:03,621 --> 01:00:05,810
combination of zero,
zero,

1345
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:06,621
zero,
one,

1346
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:07,910
one zero,
one one,

1347
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,270
right?

1348
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,070
So it might be that it's 50 percent
zero,

1349
01:00:10,071 --> 01:00:13,910
zero and 50 percent one one.
So you don't know what either bit is,

1350
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:15,430
but he know they're the same,
right?

1351
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:18,940
So that's entanglement.
So you take these two ideas that you

1352
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:23,060
have a combination of Zeros and ones
rather than just one or the other and

1353
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:25,550
the different bits can be entangled with
each other.

1354
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:27,940
And then you just say,
well what is a computer?

1355
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,600
A computer is something that takes bits
in,

1356
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:31,760
does manipulations,
and spits out the answer,

1357
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,890
right?
You solve problems,

1358
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:35,390
you.
That's what's literally going on.

1359
01:00:35,391 --> 01:00:37,760
And your computer as a bunch of zeroes
and ones being pushed around.

1360
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,670
So a quantum computer is pushing out a
bunch of cubits,

1361
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:43,190
right?
Bunch of spinning particles or something

1362
01:00:43,191 --> 01:00:45,440
like that.
The spin of a particle that can either

1363
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,170
be spinning clockwise or
counterclockwise is a cupid,

1364
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,260
and so these particles can interact with
each other,

1365
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:55,310
they can become entangled and you invent
a quantum algorithm,

1366
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:55,820
right?

1367
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:59,270
Like there's algorithms for finding the
area of a surface or something like

1368
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:02,210
that.
Factoring large numbers,

1369
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:04,610
you know,
solving the shortest distance between

1370
01:01:04,611 --> 01:01:08,150
two different points.
You can do this using the rules of

1371
01:01:08,151 --> 01:01:11,780
quantum mechanics instead of the rules
of classical mechanics and the belief

1372
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:13,970
which is not yet 100 percent
established,

1373
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:17,780
but we think is true is that there are
some problems that are really,

1374
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:20,420
really hard to solve for a classical
computer,

1375
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:23,900
which means that you can easily make the
problem long enough that it would take

1376
01:01:23,901 --> 01:01:28,190
the lifetime of the universe to solve it
on a classical computer which quantum

1377
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,770
computers can solve quite quickly and
efficiently.

1378
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,470
And so it's.
We're not,

1379
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:35,590
we haven't proven that it's not a
mathematically why.

1380
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,450
Why would they think that quantum
computers will be able to solve it

1381
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:40,730
quicker?
There's more information in the quantum

1382
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:43,100
computer,
like if you have two bits,

1383
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:43,970
zero,
zero,

1384
01:01:43,971 --> 01:01:44,331
zero,
one,

1385
01:01:44,331 --> 01:01:44,840
etc.

1386
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,410
There's only four things that can be
right if you have a quantum computer is

1387
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:52,280
an infinite number of things it can be
because it's any combination of those

1388
01:01:52,281 --> 01:01:53,150
four things,
right?

1389
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,740
Ten percent this,
20 percent that.

1390
01:01:54,741 --> 01:01:57,440
So There's like a continuum of
possibilities.

1391
01:01:57,441 --> 01:01:59,600
It's,
it's analog rather than digital in some

1392
01:01:59,601 --> 01:02:01,840
sense.
And so what you,

1393
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:02,720
what you can do,
you know,

1394
01:02:02,721 --> 01:02:04,640
the,
the quantum computer can just sort of

1395
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,750
take advantage of that extra power,
um,

1396
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:10,130
to look,
I mean,

1397
01:02:10,131 --> 01:02:12,100
because of this entanglement,
what this is,

1398
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,050
this is I'm going to get in trouble with
my quantum computing friends because not

1399
01:02:15,051 --> 01:02:18,200
quite fair,
but roughly speaking rather than

1400
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:22,170
manipulating bit by bit because of the
entanglement between the bits.

1401
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,810
The quantum computer can move all the
bits a little bit at once.

1402
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:28,110
So let's say that you're,
you're searching for something in the

1403
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:28,711
list,
right?

1404
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:32,430
A very elementary,
a computer science program is,

1405
01:02:32,431 --> 01:02:33,510
I'm giving you a list.

1406
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:35,910
find an element that is equal to a
certain number,

1407
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,290
right?
It sounds easy,

1408
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:39,510
but if that list is 10 trillion things
long,

1409
01:02:39,511 --> 01:02:40,344
that's hard.
Right?

1410
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,550
So what the quantum computer can do is
say,

1411
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:47,590
take every element in the list,
nudge it a little bit towards zero if

1412
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:51,330
it's the wrong answer in towards one if
it's the right answer and you don't know

1413
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:54,060
where it is in the list,
but you can do that nudging over and

1414
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,170
over again.
At the end of the day,

1415
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:59,460
you look for where's the one it's very
easy to find so you can get the answer

1416
01:02:59,461 --> 01:03:01,410
much quicker.
It is believed.

1417
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:05,400
and so things like cryptography,
privacy,

1418
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,460
right or dramatically changed by this
because if one of the things that we

1419
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:13,050
think quantum computers should be able
to do faster is factor large numbers,

1420
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:14,330
which is the,
the,

1421
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,270
the difficulty in factoring large
numbers is the basis for much modern

1422
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,040
cryptography,
uh,

1423
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:23,910
but also simulating systems that were
just too difficult to simulate,

1424
01:03:23,911 --> 01:03:24,330
you know,
just,

1425
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:26,520
just took too much computer power to do
it.

1426
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:29,580
Now maybe we can do it because nature is
truly quantum mechanical.

1427
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,730
At the core,
it turns out to be very hard because the

1428
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:35,670
problem is you have all these bits.
If you touch one of them,

1429
01:03:35,671 --> 01:03:37,770
if the outside world bumps into one of
them,

1430
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:40,170
right,
like a cosmic ray or adam hits it,

1431
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:43,080
the whole entanglement is ruined between
everything.

1432
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:46,590
So it's very,
very delicate and that's what the,

1433
01:03:46,591 --> 01:03:48,180
you know right now,
um,

1434
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,370
they're,
they're working on systems of let's say

1435
01:03:50,371 --> 01:03:53,340
dozens of cubits entangled at once.
You would,

1436
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,540
you would like it to be way more than
that because you can store an enormous

1437
01:03:57,541 --> 01:04:00,360
amount of information in these things
and uh,

1438
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:05,700
if it works as I think it'll be way
better at computing if it works.

1439
01:04:05,701 --> 01:04:09,780
I'm not at all sure that quantum
computers will be efficient or cost

1440
01:04:09,781 --> 01:04:12,180
effective or anything like that in the
near term.

1441
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:14,970
But you know,
doing computations faster or something

1442
01:04:14,971 --> 01:04:18,120
is a lot of people wouldn't be able to
do so right now they're working with

1443
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:21,840
dozens of cubits and what's preventing
them from expanding that or they're

1444
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,450
doing it slowly,
sort of make sure that it all works

1445
01:04:24,451 --> 01:04:27,870
correctly and get a,
an accurate model.

1446
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,420
Yeah.
So the problem is if you had a cubit,

1447
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,640
it can be in a combination of zero or
one,

1448
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,410
right?
Any combination whatsoever,

1449
01:04:34,411 --> 01:04:38,010
but as soon as you look at it,
you never see the combination.

1450
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:41,880
You see zero or you see one that's it
and you've ruined.

1451
01:04:41,881 --> 01:04:44,730
You've erased this preexisting
combination.

1452
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:47,730
If you see zero,
now it's in the state zero c one,

1453
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:50,460
it's in the state one.
So if you have a group of many,

1454
01:04:50,461 --> 01:04:53,700
many cubits,
what I mean by look at is literally

1455
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,620
anything else in the world bumping into
it.

1456
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,600
So like if,
like I said,

1457
01:04:57,601 --> 01:04:59,520
if photons headed,
if particles,

1458
01:04:59,521 --> 01:04:59,951
uh,
you know,

1459
01:04:59,951 --> 01:05:03,000
if,
if molecules of air and oxygen or

1460
01:05:03,001 --> 01:05:07,200
nitrogen bump into the cubit,
that'll count as an observation and it

1461
01:05:07,201 --> 01:05:10,500
will collapse as we say,
it collapses the wave function and then

1462
01:05:10,501 --> 01:05:12,300
all of your quantum information is
ruined.

1463
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:13,780
So,
uh,

1464
01:05:13,781 --> 01:05:15,360
you have to make them a sort of very
cold,

1465
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:18,610
very isolated,
very from external influences.

1466
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:22,290
And the more cubits you add,
the harder that is to do well.

1467
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,030
Now,
was there a proof of concept this?

1468
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,950
Yep.
They have working quantum computers.

1469
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:29,590
I forget.
There was a joke.

1470
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:32,080
Scott aaronson,
who's a friend of mine who's a genius,

1471
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:36,580
a theoretical computer scientist.
he used to joke that the quantum

1472
01:05:36,581 --> 01:05:40,960
computers are able to say that the
number 15 is equal to five times three

1473
01:05:40,961 --> 01:05:43,750
with very high probability.
That was the state of the art.

1474
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,810
I think they're able to say that 21
equals three times seven with very high

1475
01:05:46,811 --> 01:05:47,860
probability now.
But,

1476
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:49,540
uh,
what you would like to say is,

1477
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,730
you know,
some hundred digit number is the product

1478
01:05:51,731 --> 01:05:53,950
of two other numbers not able to do that
right now.

1479
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:56,360
Now,
what are they looking at with this and

1480
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,930
when they're,
when they're looking at in terms of the

1481
01:05:58,931 --> 01:06:00,310
future,
this stuff,

1482
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,260
what are the,
how do they want to implement this?

1483
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:06,490
Lots of different ways actually,
like the actual physical technology that

1484
01:06:06,491 --> 01:06:09,250
they're using.
Some people are using adam's,

1485
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,260
some people are using sort of um,
uh,

1486
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:16,750
features of condensed matter systems
like two dimensional systems where

1487
01:06:16,751 --> 01:06:20,230
electrons are moving slowly and can wind
around each other and things like that.

1488
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,960
ThiS is way beyond what I actually know
about,

1489
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:28,360
but also this sort of side light of this
is that this existence of entanglement,

1490
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,760
um,
it's kind of a shared information

1491
01:06:30,761 --> 01:06:31,990
between two different things.

1492
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:34,660
In a way that classical physics just
would not allow,

1493
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:39,490
and that's interesting and exciting
because it opens up ways,

1494
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:40,420
uh,
for,

1495
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:44,320
for sharing information that other
people can't get to because you have

1496
01:06:44,321 --> 01:06:45,820
some information.
Your friend has some information,

1497
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:46,600
but it's,
it,

1498
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,820
you need both pieces of it to get to it.
Right.

1499
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:52,660
I'm seth lloyd,
who's another friend of mine at mit,

1500
01:06:52,661 --> 01:06:56,560
professor said that he was,
he tells a story where he was in a hot

1501
01:06:56,561 --> 01:07:01,390
tub with the google guys,
right with sergey and larry and you

1502
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:02,710
know,
the heads of google,

1503
01:07:02,711 --> 01:07:03,910
the founders,
and he said,

1504
01:07:03,911 --> 01:07:05,830
oh,
I came up with this brilliant new idea

1505
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:11,280
where we can use quantum mechanics build
a quantum computer so that a person who

1506
01:07:11,441 --> 01:07:14,800
does a search,
a google search using this quantum

1507
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:17,080
computer,
they can do a search and they can get

1508
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:19,330
their answer,
but it is literally impossible for

1509
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:21,490
anyone else to ever know what they
searched for.

1510
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:25,030
And the google guys are like very
excited and they went away.

1511
01:07:25,031 --> 01:07:26,320
The next day they came back and said,
oh,

1512
01:07:26,321 --> 01:07:28,600
we realized this is the opposite of our
business model.

1513
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,870
It's really important to us that we know
what he's right.

1514
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:36,970
That's the whole thing with them.
Google ads,

1515
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,000
google ad sense.
When you go to another website,

1516
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:40,900
it's shows you,
oh,

1517
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,090
sean's been looking at,
you know,

1518
01:07:43,091 --> 01:07:47,530
lenovo laptops and they follow you
around and all your other devices,

1519
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:49,240
your cookies.
Creepy.

1520
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:52,020
But yeah,
so In quantum in quantum computing is

1521
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:54,970
there's quantum money,
there's quantum cryptography,

1522
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,670
there's quantum eavesdropping,
things like that.

1523
01:07:57,671 --> 01:07:58,570
So it's just,
uh,

1524
01:07:58,571 --> 01:08:00,910
it's,
it's easy to speculate about.

1525
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:04,330
I would not say the actual technology is
very far advanced right now,

1526
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:07,300
but I can't tell you how quickly.
Why wouldn't someone like google just

1527
01:08:07,301 --> 01:08:11,530
have to adjust?
Because prior to these google ads,

1528
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,190
you'd never really knew what someone was
interested in unless they took

1529
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:19,460
surveys or unless they had purchasing
history.

1530
01:08:19,461 --> 01:08:23,600
are there had to be some way that you
could now that just detecting off of

1531
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:25,520
searches and that's what their business
model is.

1532
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:29,300
That doesn't mean they can't come up
with a better new business model.

1533
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:32,270
They will have to adapt,
but they are not in the business of

1534
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,480
making that happen.
No stAte now.

1535
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:36,260
It's so effective.
If they were really smart,

1536
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:39,680
they would have given $100,000 and they
didn't tell no one about this ever

1537
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:42,110
again.
Is that enough?

1538
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:44,000
Yeah.
we found out what the stormy daniels

1539
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:45,920
case.
That hundred thousand dollars doesn't

1540
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,750
buy a lot of two thirds of a stormy
daniel.

1541
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:54,680
What do you think they'll like?
What will be the first way they try to

1542
01:08:54,681 --> 01:08:58,700
use something like this?
They try to use quantum computing.

1543
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,470
I don't know.
I think that,

1544
01:09:00,471 --> 01:09:01,690
um,
you know,

1545
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,620
the people who are really interested in
now are,

1546
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:05,810
uh,
the nsa in the dod,

1547
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,820
right?
A national security agency and the

1548
01:09:07,821 --> 01:09:12,260
department of defense because secret
messages are the most obvious thing.

1549
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,130
I'm cracking codes and things like that.
That's like the killer app that we know

1550
01:09:16,131 --> 01:09:18,320
about right now.
I'm a physicist.

1551
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:20,540
Of course,
when you use it to simulate quantum

1552
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:23,600
mechanical systems to learn about other
behavior materials,

1553
01:09:23,601 --> 01:09:26,120
like maybe you will build a better super
conductor or something like that right

1554
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:29,180
away.
Maybe you'll do better designing of your

1555
01:09:29,181 --> 01:09:31,460
genetically engineered dna on a quantum
computer.

1556
01:09:31,461 --> 01:09:33,980
Right?
Like there's sort of the generic thought

1557
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:35,600
that you'll be able to do computations
faster.

1558
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:39,470
That's interesting.
Then there's more specific things like

1559
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,920
if the system you're trying to simulate
is itself quantum mechanical than

1560
01:09:42,921 --> 01:09:44,960
simulating it on a quantum computer
might be the way to go.

1561
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:50,010
Yeah.
To most people that just were woo right

1562
01:09:50,011 --> 01:09:51,230
over their head.
What is,

1563
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:54,150
what are these guys?
The quantum is so weird.

1564
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,010
Like one of the things that you said
earlier,

1565
01:09:56,011 --> 01:09:57,870
you were,
when you were talking about quantum,

1566
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:02,700
you were talking about worlds that are
very similar but with very small

1567
01:10:02,701 --> 01:10:03,740
differences,
right?

1568
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:05,070
Yes.
So,

1569
01:10:05,071 --> 01:10:06,060
uh,
yeah,

1570
01:10:06,061 --> 01:10:08,020
I forget whether we talked about this
last time.

1571
01:10:08,021 --> 01:10:08,060
Um,

1572
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,650
but you know,
so there's this whole version of

1573
01:10:10,651 --> 01:10:11,431
quantum.
Well let me,

1574
01:10:11,431 --> 01:10:12,410
let me back up because we.
okay,

1575
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,313
right.
Sure.

1576
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:18,030
Quantum mechanics is weird because among
other things it is by far the most

1577
01:10:18,031 --> 01:10:20,430
successful theory of physics ever
invented.

1578
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:22,950
We've tested it to enormous precision,
right?

1579
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,770
There's zero evidence.
Quantum mechanics is in any way not

1580
01:10:25,771 --> 01:10:27,900
right,
but we don't understand it.

1581
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,210
We don't,
we are not just people in the street

1582
01:10:30,211 --> 01:10:33,750
like professional physicists don't know
exactly what quantum mechanics says,

1583
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,340
so how do you practice it?
Well,

1584
01:10:35,341 --> 01:10:37,980
we have a recipe.
We have a black box,

1585
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:38,721
right?
The way that I,

1586
01:10:38,721 --> 01:10:42,500
I put it in the book is imagine you had
a website you could go to and you would

1587
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:43,620
say,
you know,

1588
01:10:43,621 --> 01:10:46,200
if I threw a ball with certain velocity
in a certain direction,

1589
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:48,060
how far would it go?
And it will give you the answer right

1590
01:10:48,061 --> 01:10:49,120
away depending upon.

1591
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:49,953
Does that.
Yeah.

1592
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,020
Did you put all the details and it gives
you the answer.

1593
01:10:52,021 --> 01:10:54,090
Does that count as you knowing the laws
of physics,

1594
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:55,010
you know?
No.

1595
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,550
You just have a black box,
right?

1596
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:58,650
Well that's what quantum mechanics is
right now.

1597
01:10:58,651 --> 01:11:02,370
If we set up an experiment,
we can say what the probability of every

1598
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:04,830
answer is going to be every outcome,
but if you say,

1599
01:11:04,831 --> 01:11:05,760
well,
why?

1600
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:07,740
What happened?
We don't know,

1601
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,670
or we don't agree like different people
disagree with each other and so this

1602
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,820
version of quantum,
there's different that try to answer

1603
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:17,070
this question,
what's really going on beneath the

1604
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:17,731
surface?
Right?

1605
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:22,350
What's what's the deep down story of the
world and one of these stories is the

1606
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:25,950
many worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics and it was invented by a

1607
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:28,470
graduate student,
whoever in the 19 fifties who was

1608
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:31,000
instantly kicked out of physics because
really?

1609
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:31,801
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1610
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:36,801
That is a long unglorious history of
people trying to think deeply about

1611
01:11:36,871 --> 01:11:41,550
quantum mechanics and being shunned in
the community for doing so because we've

1612
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:43,440
set up this weird thing where,
I mean,

1613
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:46,310
there was literally a memo that went
around the major physics journal.

1614
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:49,710
The United States said we will not even
look at papers that try to think about

1615
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,430
the foundations of quantum mechanics.
Uh,

1616
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,610
it's embarrassing.
It's terrible.

1617
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,360
It's like we need to do like real work,
like shut up and calculate,

1618
01:11:57,361 --> 01:11:59,160
you know,
we need to build bombs and things not

1619
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:02,280
think about the nature of reality,
which I think is very much antithetical

1620
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:04,590
to what physicists should be doing.
But anyway,

1621
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:07,350
so many world says is,
well,

1622
01:12:07,351 --> 01:12:09,560
so what we.
When we do talk about quantum mechanics,

1623
01:12:09,561 --> 01:12:11,700
but let's say we have a cube and we have
a spinning particle,

1624
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:14,670
right?
We have this combination of spinning

1625
01:12:14,671 --> 01:12:17,820
clockwise and counterclockwise,
and so we call that the wave function.

1626
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:20,880
The wave function is just,
it's 10 percent clockwise,

1627
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:23,550
2090 percent counter clockwise or
whatever.

1628
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:26,100
So to every possible measurement
outcome,

1629
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:29,640
you give me a number and that number is
basically how I figured out the

1630
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:31,710
probability of that measurement outcome
coming true,

1631
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:34,860
and that's the wave function.
So there for a long time people thought,

1632
01:12:34,861 --> 01:12:36,030
well,
this is just a trick.

1633
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:40,470
This is just like some it,
it characterizes our inability to be

1634
01:12:40,471 --> 01:12:41,430
precise,
right?

1635
01:12:41,431 --> 01:12:43,470
We have a probability of this,
a probability of that,

1636
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,170
but someday they hoped.
Einstein,

1637
01:12:46,171 --> 01:12:48,570
for example,
had this hope that we'll have a better

1638
01:12:48,571 --> 01:12:52,530
theory and we'll know exactly how to
predict everything with perfect

1639
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,120
precision.
So whatever it says,

1640
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:55,381
no,
no,

1641
01:12:55,381 --> 01:12:56,520
no.
It's the other way around.

1642
01:12:57,010 --> 01:13:00,060
Um,
this wave function is reality.

1643
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:01,860
That's the whole world,
right?

1644
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:04,490
That's what reality is.
It is a superposition.

1645
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,600
The combination of all the different
possible outcomes.

1646
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,790
It's not any one outcome.
There's no such thing as where the

1647
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:11,100
electron is,
it's all spread out.

1648
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:16,880
And the problem with that is that when
you look at the electron spinning,

1649
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:20,940
you never see It as a combination of
spinning clockwise and counterclockwise.

1650
01:13:20,941 --> 01:13:24,090
You always see one or the other and
everett says,

1651
01:13:24,091 --> 01:13:28,470
that's because you have a wave function.
You live as a superposition of different

1652
01:13:28,471 --> 01:13:30,900
possibilities.
And when you look at the electron,

1653
01:13:30,901 --> 01:13:35,901
what happens is before there was you and
there was an electron and a combination

1654
01:13:35,971 --> 01:13:40,470
of counterclockwise and clockwise,
afterward there is the electron was

1655
01:13:40,471 --> 01:13:45,471
spinning clockwise and spinning
clockwise plus that's 10 percent,

1656
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:47,310
the 90 percent.
The electron was spinning

1657
01:13:47,311 --> 01:13:50,190
counterclockwise and you saw that
spinning counterclockwise and both

1658
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:53,880
possibilities are real,
but they're separate.

1659
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:56,430
They've branched off from each other,
they've gone their own ways.

1660
01:13:56,431 --> 01:14:00,060
There's separate versions of the world,
separate copies of reality.

1661
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:03,630
That's why it's called the many worlds
interpretation of quantum mechanics.

1662
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:09,840
Possibilities is always a big feature.
That's the thing that people are

1663
01:14:09,841 --> 01:14:11,040
constantly discussing,
right?

1664
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:12,220
What are the possibilities?

1665
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:15,220
Predicting the possIbilities and when it
comes to human beings,

1666
01:14:15,221 --> 01:14:19,060
this is also randomly discussed because
we,

1667
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:21,430
we,
we talk about determinism versus

1668
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:23,740
freewill.
We talk about what are the,

1669
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:25,120
what,
what's created,

1670
01:14:25,121 --> 01:14:28,690
what are the possibilities that is
created as Sean Carroll and why?

1671
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:31,780
Why do you think the way you think and
why are you going to say the next thing

1672
01:14:31,781 --> 01:14:35,170
you're going to say and is it,
how much of it is biological,

1673
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:38,230
how much of it is your life experience,
how much of it is information that's

1674
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,440
dancing in your head?
How much are you interacting with me?

1675
01:14:41,441 --> 01:14:43,060
The last thing that I've said to you.

1676
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,540
Yeah,
so I had a.

1677
01:14:44,541 --> 01:14:47,390
I was on the same harris's podcast.
We had a long conversation about this

1678
01:14:47,391 --> 01:14:50,410
because he is very anti freewill and I
think that it's.

1679
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:52,730
I,
I disagree with him but I don't care.

1680
01:14:52,731 --> 01:14:55,320
I think kind of boring to be honest,
as he was born.

1681
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:59,630
I think it's boring because here's what
I think it's boring because there's two

1682
01:14:59,631 --> 01:15:01,880
questions.
One question is how does the world work?

1683
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:04,820
And the other question is what words
should be attached to how the world

1684
01:15:04,821 --> 01:15:07,940
works and the first one is interesting
and the second one is kind of boring.

1685
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:09,760
I see what you're saying.
I've seen seminar,

1686
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:12,490
I agree on how the world works,
right?

1687
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,820
But I am what philosophers call a
compatiblist when it comes to freewill,

1688
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:17,960
which,
which is,

1689
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:23,240
I don't think that I have some ways of
thinking my way into overcoming the laws

1690
01:15:23,241 --> 01:15:24,080
of physics,
right?

1691
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,260
Like I'm made of atoms made,
uh,

1692
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:31,720
particles that obey the laws of physics.
If I talk about myself as a large

1693
01:15:32,121 --> 01:15:34,940
collection of atoms and particles
obeying the laws of physics,

1694
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,790
then clearly there's no free will.
There's just the solution to the

1695
01:15:37,791 --> 01:15:40,970
equations and sometimes the wave
function branches and there's now two of

1696
01:15:40,971 --> 01:15:42,350
me,
but that's whatever it is.

1697
01:15:42,351 --> 01:15:46,880
There's no spark of consciousness that
lets me overcome what the equation site

1698
01:15:46,881 --> 01:15:49,010
is going to happen.
But guess what?

1699
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:52,520
That's not a fruitful way to go through
your life in terms of talking about

1700
01:15:52,521 --> 01:15:55,460
human beings.
When you meet somebody for the first

1701
01:15:55,461 --> 01:15:56,520
time and you say like,
you know,

1702
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,680
what do you do?
Who are you?

1703
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,520
They don't give you a list of their
atoms and say what every atom is doing

1704
01:16:01,521 --> 01:16:03,400
and say,
let you let go ahead and solve for

1705
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:05,390
triggers equation to figure out what's
going to happen next.

1706
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:06,890
Right?
You tell a story,

1707
01:16:06,891 --> 01:16:09,950
you say like you're a person,
you know you grew up in a certain place,

1708
01:16:09,951 --> 01:16:11,390
you have a certain jobs,
stuff like that.

1709
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:16,400
You dramatically condense the
information about who you are into a few

1710
01:16:16,821 --> 01:16:21,680
salient points and among those salient
points are I am a person who thinks and

1711
01:16:21,681 --> 01:16:24,350
makes decisions.
Every person in the world,

1712
01:16:24,351 --> 01:16:27,920
no matter how anti-free will they are
talks about people as if they make

1713
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:31,310
decisions and the reason they do is
because that's how people are.

1714
01:16:31,311 --> 01:16:33,050
That's the best way to talk about
people.

1715
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:37,190
It's not like just a compromise,
like if you don't know the atoms and

1716
01:16:37,191 --> 01:16:41,480
molecules and somebody's body and you're
not infinitely computationally powerful,

1717
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,290
so you can predict the future,
then it's correct to talk about people

1718
01:16:45,291 --> 01:16:48,230
as agents who make decisions.
We call that freewill.

1719
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:51,140
I call that freewill.
Most philosophers call it free will.

1720
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:53,810
If you don't want to call it freewill,
be my guest.

1721
01:16:53,811 --> 01:16:55,490
I don't really know,
it doesn't really matter to.

1722
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:58,410
I agree with what you're saying.
I think that makes a lot of sense and I

1723
01:16:58,411 --> 01:17:01,050
think that really simplifies a very
complex issue.

1724
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:03,780
I,
when I looked at it and I have had this

1725
01:17:03,781 --> 01:17:06,200
conversation with sam as well,
uh,

1726
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:10,070
I totally see his point and I think he
makes 100 percent sense.

1727
01:17:10,071 --> 01:17:12,320
It's as,
there's no arguing with it.

1728
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,200
I really think it's very rational that
approach.

1729
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:20,000
But I also think that it's very much
like what we were talking about earlier,

1730
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:22,490
that it's not necessarily just a one or
a zero,

1731
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,350
but it's a combination of these things
freewill.

1732
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:29,810
There has to,
there is some mechanism that chooses to

1733
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:33,350
do one thing versus another.
There's some computation,

1734
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,240
there's calculation,
there's debate,

1735
01:17:35,241 --> 01:17:38,540
there's discussion,
there's a thing inside of you.

1736
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:42,110
Whatever it is,
whatever that process is that's causing

1737
01:17:42,111 --> 01:17:43,820
you to.
I mean,

1738
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:48,560
how many times have people stayed up all
night going over and over and over a

1739
01:17:48,561 --> 01:17:50,870
certain idea of trying to find a
rational conclusion.

1740
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:52,860
Oh yeah.
All right,

1741
01:17:52,861 --> 01:17:54,120
well what is that?
Is that,

1742
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,860
is that,
is that,

1743
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:59,550
this is where the,
it actually becomes interesting to talk

1744
01:17:59,551 --> 01:18:01,360
about the vocabulary we use,
right?

1745
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:06,060
Because it becomes very,
very hard to know where to attach the

1746
01:18:06,061 --> 01:18:07,590
word.
I or you,

1747
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:11,700
when you're talking about this,
we tend to say I made a decision.

1748
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:12,900
Okay,
that's fine.

1749
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,810
Right?
I decided to have this can have pure

1750
01:18:15,811 --> 01:18:17,550
caffeine that you put in front of me and
drink it.

1751
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:20,670
Um,
I could have decided otherwise.

1752
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:23,760
So that's the question,
like does it make sense to say I could

1753
01:18:23,761 --> 01:18:28,761
have decided otherwise?
And if you define yourself as the

1754
01:18:28,891 --> 01:18:31,830
following list of atoms and particles in
a certain configuration,

1755
01:18:31,831 --> 01:18:34,650
then no.
Then the laws of physics said that that

1756
01:18:34,651 --> 01:18:37,440
was going to happen.
but I don't know what all that is.

1757
01:18:37,441 --> 01:18:38,940
That's not a useful way of talking.

1758
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:43,290
So there's a whole nother way of talking
that says I'm a person and I kind of

1759
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:45,600
like coffee,
but I already had a cup this morning and

1760
01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:46,650
you know,
there's a chance,

1761
01:18:46,651 --> 01:18:49,380
there's a probability,
like you say that I would drink this and

1762
01:18:49,381 --> 01:18:53,130
it probably that I would not.
And those are completely compatible.

1763
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:55,800
Although they're different,
the only way you get into trouble is if

1764
01:18:55,801 --> 01:18:58,620
you mix up those two different ways of
talking.

1765
01:18:58,621 --> 01:19:02,670
If you say like I chose to have the
coffee because my atoms were following

1766
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:04,170
configuration or something like that.
right.

1767
01:19:04,171 --> 01:19:07,200
That's like talking about us as humans
and then switching vocabulary.

1768
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:09,690
He's talking about us as adams and
that's where you get in trouble.

1769
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,710
Yeah.
It's a weird reductionist take on what

1770
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:14,510
it means to be a person that thinks.

1771
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:15,071
Yeah.
Yeah.

1772
01:19:15,071 --> 01:19:18,280
I think if you say there's no free will
in your adams,

1773
01:19:18,281 --> 01:19:20,020
then I'm with you.
I'm on board,

1774
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:24,100
but no one in the world goes through
life that way for good reason and they

1775
01:19:24,101 --> 01:19:25,210
never will.
It's not going to happen.

1776
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:28,210
Yeah.
Well he and you could break that all the

1777
01:19:28,211 --> 01:19:30,070
way down to creativity.
Right?

1778
01:19:30,071 --> 01:19:32,590
Like what?
When someone sits down and writes

1779
01:19:32,591 --> 01:19:34,900
something like where's all that coming
from?

1780
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:36,480
Yeah.
So I think again,

1781
01:19:36,481 --> 01:19:39,810
there's feminism as well.
There is an interesting question about,

1782
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,510
you know,
how much we will ultimately be able to

1783
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,480
unpack and understand about that.
Right.

1784
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:48,960
Right now the brain is kind of just a
mystery box to us and there's so much we

1785
01:19:48,961 --> 01:19:51,270
don't know about how people make
decisions,

1786
01:19:51,271 --> 01:19:54,420
how they remember things,
how they come up with new ideas,

1787
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:58,350
so,
so where it matters is how we treat

1788
01:19:58,351 --> 01:19:59,550
people,
right?

1789
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:04,140
Like the obvious case is responsibility.
Blame.

1790
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:06,360
Like if,
if you think that a person makes

1791
01:20:06,361 --> 01:20:09,060
choices,
then you can assign responsibility to

1792
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:10,940
them for making the choices they made.
Yes.

1793
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:13,950
That's what we do in the world.
If someone chooses to rob a bank,

1794
01:20:13,951 --> 01:20:15,660
we choose to put them in jail,
right?

1795
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:18,570
And someone,
someone could come along and say,

1796
01:20:18,571 --> 01:20:20,670
no one ever does this,
but someone could come along and say,

1797
01:20:20,671 --> 01:20:22,530
well,
they're just a bunch of atoms obeying

1798
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:23,490
laws of physics.

1799
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,900
How can you blame them?
Right?

1800
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,910
It will pop.
That doesn't make any sense,

1801
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:31,230
but what if you were minority report,
right?

1802
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:35,130
What if you could like put someone in an
mri in a brain scanner and say,

1803
01:20:35,131 --> 01:20:35,731
yeah,
you know what?

1804
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:39,060
Tomorrow they're gonna rob a bank.
Do you arrest them?

1805
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,290
Is that,
is that enough?

1806
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:44,160
Right.
The fact that their brain was hooked up

1807
01:20:44,161 --> 01:20:48,030
to a to violate the law and the future,
is that enough to sign personal

1808
01:20:48,031 --> 01:20:51,270
responsibility to them for that or do
you more do you do the opposite and say,

1809
01:20:51,271 --> 01:20:52,500
well,
it's going to happen no matter what.

1810
01:20:52,501 --> 01:20:53,460
We can't really blame them.

1811
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:56,700
Well,
and also if you do catch this thought

1812
01:20:56,701 --> 01:21:00,090
process is before the actual action
takes place,

1813
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:05,040
isn't impossible to correct that thought
process with education or some sort of

1814
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:09,600
awareness training or something where
you could shift the consciousness and

1815
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:14,930
abruptly sort of disassembled
determinism at its most problematic

1816
01:21:16,891 --> 01:21:17,570
point.

1817
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:18,560
Yeah,
so there's a.

1818
01:21:18,561 --> 01:21:23,561
There's a whole kind of a interesting
set of ideas that are very popular among

1819
01:21:24,411 --> 01:21:27,650
philosophers right now,
which is the question of moral luck.

1820
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:31,460
Oh,
so if you're driving down the street and

1821
01:21:31,461 --> 01:21:32,990
you're buzzed,
you're drunk,

1822
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:35,180
right?
maybe you get home,

1823
01:21:35,181 --> 01:21:38,060
fine.
Maybe someone jumped in front of your

1824
01:21:38,061 --> 01:21:42,160
car and you run them over because you
don't have the agility or the reflexes

1825
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,130
because you're drunk.
Right?

1826
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:46,940
So you're the same person.
You went home,

1827
01:21:46,941 --> 01:21:50,210
you're drunk and you're driving home,
but depending on the outside world,

1828
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:51,770
you ran someone over and killed them
where you didn't,

1829
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:56,450
but in the world we blame the person who
ran somebody over.

1830
01:21:56,451 --> 01:21:58,400
We,
we punish them much more severely than

1831
01:21:58,401 --> 01:22:00,370
the person who got home safely.
Right.

1832
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:04,160
That's not their responsibility.
They sort of got unlucky there in the

1833
01:22:04,161 --> 01:22:07,030
world.
So should we blame people who had the

1834
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:10,370
chance of doing it?
No one knows the answer to these

1835
01:22:10,371 --> 01:22:11,000
questions.
These are,

1836
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,160
these are tricky things.
Like we're not very good.

1837
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:16,700
We human beings at the thing about these
probabilistic counterfactual questions.

1838
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,630
Yeah.
That's a good one.

1839
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,100
That is.
Yeah.

1840
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:22,560
Hmm.
Yeah.

1841
01:22:22,561 --> 01:22:24,210
What,
who are you then?

1842
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:26,040
Yeah.
You lucky.

1843
01:22:26,370 --> 01:22:27,091
Oh yeah.
Right.

1844
01:22:27,091 --> 01:22:29,310
I mean,
so much of what happens to us in life we

1845
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:33,030
don't get responsibility for,
for interfacing with random next every

1846
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:34,050
time we step out the door.

1847
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,010
That's right.
But,

1848
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,430
uh,
can you treat people that way

1849
01:22:38,431 --> 01:22:39,420
consistently?
It's hard,

1850
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:39,970
right?
It's tricky.

1851
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:41,370
I'm not giving the answer because I
don't know.

1852
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,011
Yeah.
this is,

1853
01:22:43,011 --> 01:22:46,170
this is tricky stuff.
We're certainly not like if you lived in

1854
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:51,171
a world where you thought that what
happened in the world was preordained

1855
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,650
that there was all the great playing out
as a master plan or at the very least,

1856
01:22:55,950 --> 01:23:00,950
that there was some sort of a karmic
influence that made good things happen

1857
01:23:01,021 --> 01:23:02,970
to good people,
bad things happen to bad people.

1858
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:04,980
Then the world makeS more sense,
right?

1859
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:05,980
Yeah.
I don't believe

1860
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,660
any of that stuff,
but at least then the world seems if,

1861
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:13,480
if there's something random,
you can attach a reason why it happens.

1862
01:23:13,481 --> 01:23:17,530
There seems to be something to karma in
that when you do good things,

1863
01:23:17,531 --> 01:23:20,200
you make people feel better,
they feel about you better,

1864
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,850
and then they interface with you in a
more positive way and that sort of like

1865
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:28,270
has this outgoing effect that's not
karma.

1866
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:30,490
That's just a smart thing to do.
Yeah.

1867
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:32,020
No,
I think that you're right,

1868
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:36,160
that we,
and maybe this is just sort of a western

1869
01:23:36,161 --> 01:23:39,970
post enlightenment way of thinking,
we tend to sort of think about immediate

1870
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:42,640
consequences for our actions for better,
for worse,

1871
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:47,020
and in the real world sort of generally
trying to be good can often pay back in

1872
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:50,830
good ways,
but the woo woo thing is that we're

1873
01:23:50,831 --> 01:23:55,831
putting out this good energy and good
energy is coming back to us and it's a

1874
01:23:55,871 --> 01:23:57,370
fun way to look at things.

1875
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,620
Although there's no evidence that points
to it.

1876
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:00,491
Yeah,
exactly.

1877
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:04,600
Like if I'm in a yoga class and my yoga
instructor is talking about different

1878
01:24:04,601 --> 01:24:07,120
energy flowing through different chakras
or whatever,

1879
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,670
I don't care.
like it doesn't bother me as long as it

1880
01:24:09,671 --> 01:24:10,590
makes me,
you know,

1881
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:14,770
do that exercise.
There's a players a little bit,

1882
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:16,480
but I'm not going to speak up,
let's put it that way.

1883
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,280
Right.
Of course you're not going to stop the

1884
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:19,960
class.
You're telling bullshit.

1885
01:24:19,961 --> 01:24:24,280
I would rather have that than you know,
if people want to come up with an excuse

1886
01:24:24,281 --> 01:24:25,460
to be a good person,
that's okay.

1887
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:28,390
It's funny that yoga class is always the
base.

1888
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:31,040
That's always where people go to talk
about like we're,

1889
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:32,860
we're woo comes from.
Yeah.

1890
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:33,550
Yeah.
It's,

1891
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:35,080
it's there.
Because I've had,

1892
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:37,030
you know,
I mean if you've done yoga,

1893
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:38,710
you know,
like there's a whole spectrum,

1894
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:38,980
right?

1895
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:42,940
Like there's teAchers who are basically
just physical therapists and there are

1896
01:24:42,941 --> 01:24:45,360
people who are complete crazy hippies,
you know,

1897
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:48,360
you have to think the right thoughts,
you know?

1898
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:52,690
Yeah.
But people are always searching for some

1899
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:57,780
understanding of really complex issues
and behavior is very complex issue.

1900
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:03,510
Sure.
Behavior and how you feel like whether

1901
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:05,280
you feel good,
we,

1902
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:09,190
you feel spiritually enriched,
whether you feel positive about

1903
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:09,931
humanity,
like the,

1904
01:25:09,931 --> 01:25:13,570
all these things are like which what was
trying to manipulate these states,

1905
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,590
whether it's through meditation and
mindfulness training,

1906
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:21,300
trying to figure out a way to positively
interface,

1907
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:22,720
you know,
it's true.

1908
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:26,620
And it goes back to where we started
talking about youtube comments because

1909
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,530
like I said,
I do react badly to bed too stupid.

1910
01:25:29,531 --> 01:25:31,030
Youtube,
well you're a human being.

1911
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:31,871
Well,
I'm a human being,

1912
01:25:31,871 --> 01:25:35,370
but I think,
and I think that the internet does a

1913
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:38,770
magnifying,
some of our bad tendencies,

1914
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,900
right?
And I think that,

1915
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:43,210
you know,
among these and until I totally include

1916
01:25:43,211 --> 01:25:48,100
myself as a bad actor here in the sense
that it's just so easy to be sarcastic

1917
01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:50,630
and put people down and,
you know,

1918
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:53,680
uh,
dIsagree in sort of dismissive ways.

1919
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:56,710
I don't think that's good.
I would like to live in a world where

1920
01:25:56,711 --> 01:25:58,360
people,
including myself,

1921
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:01,660
even when we disagree with people,
even when we disagree with people who

1922
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:04,070
are stupid and we're not trying to
engage them or improve

1923
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,750
their lives,
just,

1924
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:07,940
you know,
get on with our own lives rather than

1925
01:26:07,941 --> 01:26:12,590
trying to have a snarky comeback.
like I get that there's a purpose to

1926
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:16,430
snark and sarcasm and whatever,
but it weighs you down.

1927
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:18,410
Right?
This is why people complain about

1928
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:21,560
twitter and social media,
like it's so much psychic energy just

1929
01:26:21,561 --> 01:26:24,410
gets sapped by reading.
All oF these complaints on either side

1930
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:26,210
has no political bias,
right?

1931
01:26:26,211 --> 01:26:30,290
Like whatever your feelings are,
someone else is making you feel down on

1932
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:32,060
the internet somewhere.
and it does weigh on you.

1933
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:32,640
There's also,

1934
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:37,410
there's weird impulse that people have
with whether it's social,

1935
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:40,620
whether it's twitter or youtube
comments.

1936
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:45,740
This is reductionist take on things to
reduce a person down to maybe one

1937
01:26:48,841 --> 01:26:53,790
statement or misinterpretations of one
position and then have that person be

1938
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:54,624
dismissed.

1939
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:55,901
Yeah.
And I,

1940
01:26:55,901 --> 01:26:57,370
I think,
yeah,

1941
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:00,090
and it's a tough play.
I have,

1942
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:03,320
after thinking about it a little bit,
I think that it was a bad decision that

1943
01:27:03,321 --> 01:27:04,880
james gunn got fired,
for example.

1944
01:27:04,881 --> 01:27:07,370
I don't know if you've followed that,
that little thing.

1945
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:09,580
Guardians of the galaxy,
the galaxy guy.

1946
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:12,310
Well those were really bad tweets.
Oh yeah.

1947
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:12,790
They just

1948
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:16,430
weren't funny and he wrote a bunch of
them and they were a

1949
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:17,490
lot,
a lot of,

1950
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:20,300
a lot of about pedophilia.
So I totally get it right.

1951
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,880
I'm not shocked that he got in trouble
that way,

1952
01:27:22,881 --> 01:27:27,260
but I also think that his response was
immediate,

1953
01:27:27,261 --> 01:27:28,120
incorrect,
and grownup.

1954
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:29,810
He said he didn't say like,
oh,

1955
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:30,890
I was young.
It was a different time.

1956
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:31,461
He says,
oh yeah,

1957
01:27:31,461 --> 01:27:33,050
I did that.
It was shitty and it was wrong.

1958
01:27:33,051 --> 01:27:35,900
And I take responsibility.
And I do think we got to let people

1959
01:27:35,901 --> 01:27:36,740
grow,
right?

1960
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:41,360
Like that's what most people in this
sort of post mi do era have not done

1961
01:27:41,361 --> 01:27:42,560
when they've been accused of these
things.

1962
01:27:42,561 --> 01:27:46,220
They haven't taken responsibility.
They've made made excuses.

1963
01:27:46,221 --> 01:27:48,230
And I think that a,
on twitter,

1964
01:27:48,231 --> 01:27:51,080
especially twitter,
I think it's my favorite social media,

1965
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:51,933
but,
um,

1966
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:55,310
it is too easy to be reductive.
It's too easy to be simplistic and to

1967
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:57,020
respond.
And you're one of,

1968
01:27:57,050 --> 01:28:01,910
one of the things that annoys me the
most about twitter is when someone tries

1969
01:28:01,911 --> 01:28:04,040
to be good and then 20 other people say,
well,

1970
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:05,810
you're not being good in precisely the
right way.

1971
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:08,703
I,
I,

1972
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,760
even though I failed to live up to it
myself,

1973
01:28:10,761 --> 01:28:13,670
I'm trying to be better.
I want to be charitable when I deal with

1974
01:28:13,671 --> 01:28:15,770
other people.
I got in trouble on twitter the other

1975
01:28:15,771 --> 01:28:19,250
day for defending kellyanne conway a
little bit.

1976
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:21,560
What did she do well,
years ago?

1977
01:28:21,561 --> 01:28:25,340
She did the alternative facts thing.
Remember when she said when they were

1978
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:29,500
talking about the inauguration crowd and
people pointing out like,

1979
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:30,920
no,
that's just factually incorrect.

1980
01:28:30,921 --> 01:28:31,461
And she says,
well,

1981
01:28:31,461 --> 01:28:33,830
there are alternative facts.
So like,

1982
01:28:33,831 --> 01:28:37,280
I don't want to defend kellyanne conway,
I'm not a defender of her in general.

1983
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:40,280
Um,
but I think that she just misspoke that

1984
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:42,710
one time.
I think that what she was trying to say

1985
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:46,670
was there are additional facts that we
could also look at.

1986
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:49,730
Right?
And of course that's in a bigger context

1987
01:28:49,731 --> 01:28:51,590
where she lies all the time and she,
you know,

1988
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:53,030
uh,
let's other people,

1989
01:28:53,031 --> 01:28:55,010
she is an apologist for other liars.

1990
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:56,420
But I,
you know,

1991
01:28:56,630 --> 01:29:01,630
I think that the idea that these people
who I disagree with politically are so

1992
01:29:02,941 --> 01:29:06,090
divorced from reality that they think
they can just make up their own reality.

1993
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:08,940
No one actually thinks that way.
Like the people who,

1994
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:10,920
you know,
the people who disagree with me about

1995
01:29:10,921 --> 01:29:15,921
politics or religion or whatever,
it's comforting for me to think that

1996
01:29:16,081 --> 01:29:17,490
they are,
you know,

1997
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:22,290
just cheerfully making up facts and
reality by them selves.

1998
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:25,620
They don't think of themselves that way.
They think that they're being truthful.

1999
01:29:25,621 --> 01:29:27,220
They think of they're being rational,
incorrect.

2000
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:30,750
And so I should at least grant them that
that's what they think in their own

2001
01:29:30,751 --> 01:29:31,090
right.

2002
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:33,160
Well,
I'm going to disagree with you on that

2003
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:35,020
because I don't think that,
first of all,

2004
01:29:35,021 --> 01:29:39,640
I don't think that she's granted any
sort of autonomous decision making

2005
01:29:39,641 --> 01:29:42,850
capabilities.
And I think this is probably something

2006
01:29:42,851 --> 01:29:47,851
that was sat down that they sat down
with a team of experts or you know,

2007
01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:51,400
air quote experts,
team of people that were in that,

2008
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,640
in that you know,
room,

2009
01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:58,290
whether it's press,
people are spin doctors where they're

2010
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:01,240
trying to figure out a best way to get
out of this.

2011
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:05,440
And one of the best ways was this
concept of alternative facts.

2012
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:09,730
Very similar to the.
One of the ways where trump was in that

2013
01:30:09,731 --> 01:30:14,731
meeting with putin at very famous awful
meeting that happened recently where he

2014
01:30:14,891 --> 01:30:18,070
said,
I don't see any reason why it would be

2015
01:30:18,071 --> 01:30:21,280
Russia that's interfering.
And then he said afterwards,

2016
01:30:21,281 --> 01:30:25,510
obviously I misspoke.
I thought it was clear what I meant to

2017
01:30:25,511 --> 01:30:25,960
say.

2018
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:29,050
I didn't see any reason why wouldn't be.
I shouldn't say.

2019
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:32,140
But it's clear if you watch him say it.
Yeah.

2020
01:30:32,141 --> 01:30:34,270
That's not what he sells.
Entirely bullshit,

2021
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:36,940
entirely bullshit,
dangerous bullshit,

2022
01:30:36,941 --> 01:30:39,640
but I think gary bullshit in my opinion.
Yes,

2023
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:42,010
it's,
it's such a lie.

2024
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:43,440
Right?
In,

2025
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:47,500
in context,
the way he's expressing himself and it's

2026
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:50,140
clearly he's dismissing it.
Like why would it be,

2027
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:52,840
why would it be Russia?
He's not saying why wouldn't it be

2028
01:30:52,841 --> 01:30:57,340
Russia because he's standing right next
to putin and he would be saying that in

2029
01:30:57,341 --> 01:31:02,341
a much more measured and you would be.
It would be accusing.

2030
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:06,510
Yeah.
That was clearly a case where he did

2031
01:31:06,511 --> 01:31:11,010
something really bad and he came home
and all of his advisors said that we

2032
01:31:11,011 --> 01:31:13,920
have to fix this little bit and they
came up with a really clumsy,

2033
01:31:13,921 --> 01:31:14,820
you know,
incredibly.

2034
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:16,500
That's all they had.
That's all they had.

2035
01:31:16,501 --> 01:31:17,460
Right.
Because it's so blatant,

2036
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:20,310
right?
Alternative facts is also all that.

2037
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:21,121
I don't.
Well,

2038
01:31:21,121 --> 01:31:22,110
I.
You might be right.

2039
01:31:22,111 --> 01:31:23,160
Actually,
you know what?

2040
01:31:23,161 --> 01:31:26,880
I didn't really study it very carefully.
I think that it was just a spontaneous

2041
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:30,570
blurting out a be my favorite too,
because here's why.

2042
01:31:30,571 --> 01:31:33,360
I think that that's probably right
because I don't think I was trying to

2043
01:31:33,361 --> 01:31:35,050
say before,
I don't think that's their

2044
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:38,700
self-conception.
Like people often think that the people

2045
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:42,420
that they disagree with a think false
things,

2046
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:45,570
that's very natural,
but they also also like uncharitable he

2047
01:31:45,571 --> 01:31:50,000
say they know their thinking false
things and they're,

2048
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:50,850
you know,
they're,

2049
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:53,580
they're happily making up their own
version of reality.

2050
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:56,070
And I think that's very rare.
I think that happens,

2051
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:58,200
like if you're just a con man or
whatever,

2052
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:01,660
but I think that more often than we
wanted to admit people are sincere in

2053
01:32:01,661 --> 01:32:03,940
their very false beliefs.
Right.

2054
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:07,750
So I,
so I just find it implausible that,

2055
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,450
uh,
I mean kellyanne conway again lies all

2056
01:32:10,451 --> 01:32:13,030
the time.
That is not my defense for my defense of

2057
01:32:13,031 --> 01:32:15,550
hers.
It was just that she would not go out

2058
01:32:15,551 --> 01:32:17,110
there and say,
oh yes,

2059
01:32:17,111 --> 01:32:20,080
but we're making up new facts.
That's just not the kind of thing.

2060
01:32:20,081 --> 01:32:20,630
Something,
it's.

2061
01:32:20,630 --> 01:32:21,610
She didn't say it that way

2062
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:23,650
where she said,
there are all turned art.

2063
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:28,980
There are alternative facts.
Now you got to think that he's playing

2064
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:34,770
to the dumbest people in the room all
the time and fortunately for him that's

2065
01:32:35,171 --> 01:32:36,390
a big number.
Yeah,

2066
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:41,610
and there's a recent thing where he was
defending his behavior saying that

2067
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:46,681
anyone can act presidential and he stood
on stage and he did this sort of like

2068
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:51,310
robotic,
boring walk back and forth,

2069
01:32:51,311 --> 01:32:55,210
and then he started talking in a boring
way and mocking it.

2070
01:32:55,690 --> 01:32:58,900
And what's interesting about the video
is not just him doing this,

2071
01:32:58,901 --> 01:33:02,530
which is very silly,
but it's also the people behind him

2072
01:33:02,531 --> 01:33:05,440
thinking it's hilarious.
These nazi this.

2073
01:33:05,441 --> 01:33:06,850
Yeah.
See if he could find it.

2074
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:11,770
There's a video of him saying that he,
uh,

2075
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:15,070
anyone can act presidential.
This is very,

2076
01:33:15,071 --> 01:33:18,490
very recently and a lot of people were
watching this going what?

2077
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,280
But he alSo thinks you need id to buy
groceries.

2078
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:23,950
Yeah,
there's a lot of that.

2079
01:33:23,951 --> 01:33:24,551
There's.
well,

2080
01:33:24,551 --> 01:33:27,070
he also thinks that stealth bombers are
invisible.

2081
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:28,840
Yeah,
I see that.

2082
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:32,440
I can't see them.
You're right behind it,

2083
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:33,970
asshole.
You can look at it.

2084
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:36,930
Do you follow a kellyanne conway's
husband on twitter?

2085
01:33:36,931 --> 01:33:39,090
Do you know who he is?
George conway.

2086
01:33:39,091 --> 01:33:43,110
He's a lawyer and he's like,
like very vocally anti-trump.

2087
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:47,100
It's hilarious.
He's constantly subtweeting and like,

2088
01:33:47,101 --> 01:33:48,210
you know,
making fun of trump.

2089
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,073
Yeah.

2090
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,320
Interesting.
That's going to be fun.

2091
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:53,240
Fun household,
but what's.

2092
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:56,370
This is what gets me go full screen in
this gulf.

2093
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:59,930
You can't.
What's interesting is these dummies

2094
01:33:59,931 --> 01:34:01,570
behind him.
Yeah.

2095
01:34:01,850 --> 01:34:06,050
Like while this is happening,
one of the interesting things about this

2096
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:10,460
to me is that his back is to all these
people,

2097
01:34:10,461 --> 01:34:12,410
which is a very odd.
Right?

2098
01:34:12,411 --> 01:34:13,450
So they're all

2099
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:16,350
behind him instead of having a static
backdrop.

2100
01:34:16,370 --> 01:34:19,860
You,
you're getting to a part of the thing is

2101
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:22,920
the other people.
It's not just him,

2102
01:34:22,921 --> 01:34:26,460
it's their reactions.
Yeah.

2103
01:34:26,461 --> 01:34:29,040
It's,
it's a sense of belonging to a weird

2104
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:30,480
group.
Yeah.

2105
01:34:30,481 --> 01:34:33,120
And everyone has that,
like leftist and rightness and whatever.

2106
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:35,310
All have this weird belonging.
But when it's.

2107
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:38,010
Again,
it goes back to the China thing,

2108
01:34:38,011 --> 01:34:38,311
right?
Well,

2109
01:34:38,311 --> 01:34:40,410
we have fox news.
We have a way of giving people

2110
01:34:40,411 --> 01:34:44,100
information that if you follow.
I follow fox news on twitter because I

2111
01:34:44,101 --> 01:34:49,101
want to see what they're telling people.
It's a weird thing because it's not like

2112
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:50,910
it's all lies,
right?

2113
01:34:50,911 --> 01:34:52,590
There's,
there's often lies,

2114
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:56,160
they're there,
but it's like a very different mixture

2115
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:57,980
of things than you would get from

2116
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:00,470
the rest of the media and a lot of it
is,

2117
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:03,650
it's very clear if you,
if you follow fox news,

2118
01:35:03,651 --> 01:35:06,740
like they're,
they're targeting an older white,

2119
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:09,140
a rural suburban audience.
Right.

2120
01:35:09,141 --> 01:35:12,080
So there's a lot of like weird human
interest stories about an alligator

2121
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:13,640
popping out of the sewer and things like
that,

2122
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:16,610
like things that are not there.
They have no political agenda,

2123
01:35:16,611 --> 01:35:19,640
but they're just trying to get those old
white people to pay attention.

2124
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:21,620
Yeah.
Well they're sending a message that the

2125
01:35:21,621 --> 01:35:24,180
world is kinda scary and weird and you
know,

2126
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:26,750
we need to protect ourselves and then
later on the golf course,

2127
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:27,381
they really.
Yeah,

2128
01:35:27,381 --> 01:35:29,000
like they love those stories,
right.

2129
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:32,630
The alligator,
the golf courses is my favorite.

2130
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:36,290
It's just local news at 10:00,
local news put,

2131
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:39,920
you know,
a nationwide and edit in there with some

2132
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,880
cheerleading for this bizarrely
dysfunctional administration.

2133
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:48,210
Well isn't sean hannity now the number
one watch cable news program or

2134
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,041
something like that?
Yeah,

2135
01:35:49,041 --> 01:35:51,950
I don't know the number.
I think it's number one and it's fucking

2136
01:35:51,951 --> 01:35:53,210
off.
They just,

2137
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,850
they just,
there was just a poll.

2138
01:35:55,851 --> 01:35:58,040
This goes back to the social credit
thing.

2139
01:35:58,041 --> 01:36:01,340
They did a poll.
What is the most trusted news source?

2140
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:03,740
Um,
and fox news gave me number two.

2141
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:05,570
What's number one?
Bbc.

2142
01:36:06,230 --> 01:36:08,150
That makes sense.
We'll cnn.

2143
01:36:08,151 --> 01:36:10,970
It's just taken a giant hit because of
his constant,

2144
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:15,170
constant berating of them.
And then you see jim acosta,

2145
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:16,130
you know,
the whole,

2146
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:18,770
these,
all these pro wrestling fans like giving

2147
01:36:18,771 --> 01:36:23,771
them the finger and screaming at him.
And it's what I do worry that this is a

2148
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:28,010
hard thing to come back from because you
know,

2149
01:36:28,011 --> 01:36:32,060
once you know,
one another thing that trump said was

2150
01:36:32,061 --> 01:36:32,391
that,
you know,

2151
01:36:32,391 --> 01:36:34,290
don't believe anything you're told,
right?

2152
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:37,120
Unless you hear it from me.
And he says the same thing now.

2153
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:39,260
Sorry,
tucker carlson said the same thing,

2154
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:41,590
right?
He say that to tucker carlson said like

2155
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:43,370
any other shows in this one,
don't believe it.

2156
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:44,390
Yeah.
Look at this.

2157
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,630
Fuck the media he has on women for
trump.

2158
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:53,430
It's just.
And then after listening to this radio

2159
01:36:54,471 --> 01:36:58,670
lab podcast about these russian troll
farms and about how they implement these

2160
01:36:58,671 --> 01:36:59,510
things,
you got to think,

2161
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:05,510
is all of this organic is how many of
how much of this is orchestrated?

2162
01:37:05,511 --> 01:37:08,060
How much of this attacking cnn is
orchestrated?

2163
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:11,660
It's part of it is part of it is just it
builds on itself.

2164
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,700
All you need is just a little bit of a
push.

2165
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:18,530
Just talking to someone who is a who is
boasting about how hard to Donald Trump

2166
01:37:18,531 --> 01:37:22,380
works that like compared to previous
presidents,

2167
01:37:22,381 --> 01:37:27,381
he's really just putting in the hours
that you could think of that he wakes

2168
01:37:29,571 --> 01:37:32,950
up,
lady watches eight hours of tv every

2169
01:37:32,951 --> 01:37:33,170
day.

2170
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:34,980
He spends all the time at his own
resorts,

2171
01:37:34,990 --> 01:37:37,430
like of all the fantasies you could
invent.

2172
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:39,260
That's a very weird one.
Well,

2173
01:37:39,261 --> 01:37:41,330
people just love to find narratives of
fit.

2174
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:45,070
What would be acceptable for their
opinions.

2175
01:37:45,071 --> 01:37:48,040
So this side that they've taken.
Exactly right.

2176
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:48,913
Yeah.
And so he's,

2177
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:50,210
you know,
he give him credit,

2178
01:37:50,211 --> 01:37:52,250
he gives people a narrative that works
for them.

2179
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:54,380
Well,
cnn does it too because cnn,

2180
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:56,430
they,
they spent so little time,

2181
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,200
uh,
going over donner,

2182
01:37:58,201 --> 01:38:03,201
brazil's book about how the dnc had been
corrupted and about how they had rigged

2183
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:07,860
the primaries for hillary and really
screwed bernie sanders over.

2184
01:38:07,861 --> 01:38:09,960
This is not a narrative that they
dwelled on.

2185
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:15,090
They didn't dwell on the fact that she
illegally deleted 30 plus thousand

2186
01:38:15,091 --> 01:38:17,790
emails and said they were about yoga
classes.

2187
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:22,350
Like that shit is just as preposterous.
It's just as.

2188
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:27,510
It's just as damning against cnn as some
of the nonsense that fox news does.

2189
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:31,550
There's no one pure organization of news
that's holy object.

2190
01:38:31,551 --> 01:38:35,160
It's not just as I.
I think that fox news is a special,

2191
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,070
especially damning.
I think it talks,

2192
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:40,650
I mean fox news was founded by a guy who
was a political operative for the

2193
01:38:40,651 --> 01:38:41,820
republican party,
right?

2194
01:38:41,821 --> 01:38:45,240
Like there might,
like individual reporters for most news

2195
01:38:45,241 --> 01:38:48,990
organizations tend to be liberal,
but they also sometimes tend to

2196
01:38:48,991 --> 01:38:51,840
overcorrect for that.
Like to try to bend over backwards to be

2197
01:38:51,841 --> 01:38:54,120
fair,
like way more republicans are quoted in

2198
01:38:54,121 --> 01:38:58,470
New York times and democrats ever.
And I think that there are certainly

2199
01:38:58,471 --> 01:39:03,350
biases and certainly I'm a
misrepresentation of reality from all of

2200
01:39:03,351 --> 01:39:06,450
these different outlets,
but I think fox news is special among

2201
01:39:06,451 --> 01:39:07,450
the major ones.
I would,

2202
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:11,160
I would concede that.
But I also think that one example of the

2203
01:39:11,161 --> 01:39:14,790
New York times is different because the
New York times,

2204
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:19,050
I feel like because of the fact that
it's actually writers and it's in text,

2205
01:39:19,110 --> 01:39:23,640
you're not dealing with people that have
to be comfortable performing in front of

2206
01:39:23,641 --> 01:39:26,820
a camera,
which eliminates a large swath of

2207
01:39:26,821 --> 01:39:27,600
intellectuals.

2208
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,310
Right.
It's a very different medium.

2209
01:39:29,311 --> 01:39:34,311
It's definitely they fact check and a
carnival corrections in a way that the.

2210
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:36,620
The tv does not yet.
Yeah,

2211
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:38,890
it's theater.
It's a different thing.

2212
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:43,380
And the people like sean hannity that if
you read his written word,

2213
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:46,670
I don't think he would stand out.
No.

2214
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:47,543
And I.
And again,

2215
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:50,250
like I said this before,
I worry about what happens next because

2216
01:39:50,251 --> 01:39:53,160
I don't think that trump will win again.
I think you will.

2217
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,830
All right.
I don't think it's entirely possible

2218
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:57,000
he'll win again.
Yeah,

2219
01:39:57,001 --> 01:39:58,170
it would be.
But again,

2220
01:39:58,171 --> 01:40:00,570
I didn't think he was going to win the
first one she was going to say,

2221
01:40:00,571 --> 01:40:02,850
don't listen to me.
Like before Donald Trump,

2222
01:40:02,851 --> 01:40:06,840
I was really good at predicting who's
going to win elections and I have no

2223
01:40:06,841 --> 01:40:08,820
ability once he's in the game.
So.

2224
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:11,820
But I,
I worry that the people who sort of are

2225
01:40:11,821 --> 01:40:15,080
on his side are going to feel even more
disenfranchised,

2226
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:18,900
disenchanted and angry after he loses
again than they do now.

2227
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:20,280
And that's,
that's gonna be a problem.

2228
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:24,180
I think that's a real fear.
And I think that one of the reasons why

2229
01:40:24,181 --> 01:40:27,000
I said it's entirely possible and I
don't know if he will win again,

2230
01:40:27,001 --> 01:40:29,160
but I don't even know if I believe he'll
do it again.

2231
01:40:29,161 --> 01:40:31,590
But I think it's a possibility.
And I think that one of the reasons why

2232
01:40:31,591 --> 01:40:36,410
I think that is I don't see who's the
big candidate on the other side.

2233
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:38,910
It's opposing him.
That stands out right now.

2234
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:39,803
Yeah,
that's a problem.

2235
01:40:39,890 --> 01:40:43,770
I think there's a real issue with people
not wanting the job.

2236
01:40:45,550 --> 01:40:48,350
it's a really scary job.
You know it,

2237
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:53,460
it sucks you dry like a vampire that's
hooked up to the back of your neck is

2238
01:40:54,211 --> 01:40:59,211
just so even with him with his unique
ability to sociopathically sort of

2239
01:41:00,461 --> 01:41:03,790
navigate the waters of accusations and
guilt,

2240
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:07,300
he still looks beaten down by this job.

2241
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:08,500
Yeah,
but people want it.

2242
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:10,900
Maybe not the people we want to want it.
Right.

2243
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,350
Who sit on the democrat side,
who wants it on the left?

2244
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:15,440
That stands out.
I mean,

2245
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:19,030
I think I'm not excited by any of the
people right now,

2246
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:20,830
but the whole one is.
I bet there's going to be 10 people

2247
01:41:20,831 --> 01:41:22,970
running at least.
I mean,

2248
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:25,810
I think the biden is at least a 50
percent chance to run.

2249
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:29,210
Elizabeth warren's definitely going to
run a with warren though.

2250
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:32,500
She's got that real problem with the
whole pocahontas thing.

2251
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:36,280
Well the whole indian thing,
that narrative and then what are you

2252
01:41:36,281 --> 01:41:37,250
going to win?
Right.

2253
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:40,060
But that,
that is a giant problem.

2254
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:43,780
The thing that she may have faked
whether or not she has native american

2255
01:41:43,781 --> 01:41:48,550
heritage and she's not willing to take a
dna test and there's this native

2256
01:41:48,551 --> 01:41:52,340
american heritage she claimed is how she
got into harvard and she.

2257
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:57,190
She used that in order to get special
status and that's a problem.

2258
01:41:57,210 --> 01:41:58,420
You know,
whether or not you should forgive

2259
01:41:58,421 --> 01:42:00,430
someone for something they did a long,
long time ago,

2260
01:42:00,431 --> 01:42:05,431
which I think you probably should.
The problem is it's sort of in some ways

2261
01:42:06,311 --> 01:42:10,990
negates a lot of the good work and
things that she said because people say,

2262
01:42:10,991 --> 01:42:14,830
I can't trust her.
She lied about her actual ethnicity.

2263
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:15,910
Yeah,
it's.

2264
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:18,670
But what is hard for me to do is to
predict how much it will matter.

2265
01:42:18,671 --> 01:42:20,320
Right.
Like in 2008,

2266
01:42:20,770 --> 01:42:25,510
we had a race between Vietnam war hero
and a black guy.

2267
01:42:25,511 --> 01:42:27,320
He was middle name was hussein.
Right.

2268
01:42:27,390 --> 01:42:29,680
If you had told me that a few years
earlier,

2269
01:42:29,681 --> 01:42:31,690
who's going to win?
I would have gotten that one.

2270
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,860
We also had sarah pailin,
I think.

2271
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,400
Exactly.
This is what we don't know had taken a

2272
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:38,830
better running mate.
It's entirely possible.

2273
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:41,980
Mccain would've been president,
I think that people were really tired of

2274
01:42:41,981 --> 01:42:45,160
george w and I think that um,
mccain was just not a good candidate.

2275
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:46,260
I think he was gonna lose no matter
what.

2276
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:51,280
But I think also obama was so
charismatic and so uniquely intelligent

2277
01:42:51,971 --> 01:42:54,910
and smooth and relaxed and statesmen
like,

2278
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:57,660
I think he,
he fit the bill and remember on a

2279
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:59,950
depressed,
worried about like he went to jeremiah

2280
01:42:59,951 --> 01:43:01,670
rights church and things like that,
right.

2281
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:04,930
Stuff that didn't like at the time it
was a big deal and you know,

2282
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,750
who cares eight years later.
So I don't know about the pocahontas

2283
01:43:07,751 --> 01:43:09,730
stuff.
That's not,

2284
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,970
that's a big one though.
The pocahontas stuff is a big one

2285
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,460
because it's a personal lie.
I don't know.

2286
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:18,610
But again,
I mean I think cory booker is going to

2287
01:43:18,611 --> 01:43:20,980
run camela harris might run,
who knows?

2288
01:43:20,981 --> 01:43:22,000
There's a bunch of people.

2289
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:26,230
I would not be at all surprised that joe
biden didn't run and I kind of don't

2290
01:43:26,231 --> 01:43:30,250
think that he should,
but he's getting up there and he's in

2291
01:43:30,251 --> 01:43:32,230
Washington insider,
which is not really what the country

2292
01:43:32,231 --> 01:43:32,590
wants.
Right.

2293
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:36,760
In 1988 in boston,
we used to have joe biden night at the

2294
01:43:36,761 --> 01:43:41,140
comedy clubs and joe biden night was a
night where we would do other people's

2295
01:43:41,141 --> 01:43:44,590
material because this is when joe biden
busted.

2296
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,630
Yeah,
with kennedy's speeches.

2297
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:47,201
Yeah.
Well,

2298
01:43:47,201 --> 01:43:52,201
and neil connect the british politician
and was when he was running for

2299
01:43:52,311 --> 01:43:53,940
president in [inaudible] 88.
Right.

2300
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:57,020
And so we've never done very well
running for president.

2301
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:59,460
He's won several times.
It's so I'm,

2302
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:02,630
I think that he was a good vice
president to people like him for that

2303
01:44:02,631 --> 01:44:05,780
and they might not want them to do more
than the vice president is a great job.

2304
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,250
She want no one to pay attention to you.

2305
01:44:07,350 --> 01:44:08,640
YeAh,
exactly.

2306
01:44:09,090 --> 01:44:10,670
It's like being the,
the,

2307
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:14,390
you know,
the costar and a buddy cop movie with a

2308
01:44:14,391 --> 01:44:17,000
huge super theory responsibilities.
Go to some funerals.

2309
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:18,440
Yeah.
Easy.

2310
01:44:18,730 --> 01:44:20,150
Yeah.
Unless you're mike pence where you're

2311
01:44:20,151 --> 01:44:22,370
trying to make it the handmaid's tale
behind the scenes.

2312
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:24,680
He seems like he's kind of laying back
though,

2313
01:44:24,681 --> 01:44:28,040
like especially over the last few months
like that.

2314
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:31,740
Trump is so insane that you see very
little mike.

2315
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:33,860
I don't think you see very little of
him,

2316
01:44:33,861 --> 01:44:37,040
but I think that he's trying his best to
put in policies behind the scenes.

2317
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:38,600
Well,
um,

2318
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:42,140
what is this new thing that jeff
sessions is trying to push?

2319
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,600
Religious freedom.
Yes.

2320
01:44:44,601 --> 01:44:47,960
which means you have to obey whatever
the fundamentalist christians want to

2321
01:44:47,961 --> 01:44:48,591
do.
Yeah.

2322
01:44:48,591 --> 01:44:49,520
Well,
this is what,

2323
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:52,220
you know,
michael mouse was tweeting about this

2324
01:44:52,221 --> 01:44:53,380
the other day when,
when he,

2325
01:44:53,381 --> 01:44:54,500
he,
he tweeted this,

2326
01:44:54,501 --> 01:44:58,490
he said,
when I said that aversion of sharia law

2327
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,980
could very well be coming out of this
administration.

2328
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:02,360
This is what I'm talking about.
Yeah.

2329
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,560
Yeah.
It's a,

2330
01:45:03,561 --> 01:45:08,561
it's a weird backward thing where you
define religious freedom to be let

2331
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:10,880
fundamentalist christians do whatever
they want.

2332
01:45:10,910 --> 01:45:13,520
Right?
And do it by law.

2333
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:14,301
Yeah.
Yeah.

2334
01:45:14,301 --> 01:45:15,134
I mean,
and it's,

2335
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:18,290
it's tricky because,
uh,

2336
01:45:19,670 --> 01:45:20,151
yeah.
I don't know.

2337
01:45:20,151 --> 01:45:23,630
I mean if someone wants.
A part of me is a little bit libertarian

2338
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:25,940
when it comes to personal action,
like if someone doesn't want to deal

2339
01:45:25,941 --> 01:45:27,830
with you,
that's their right.

2340
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:32,510
But when whole groups are being subject
systematically to discrimination,

2341
01:45:32,511 --> 01:45:35,390
like gays are,
then the government steps in to protect

2342
01:45:35,391 --> 01:45:36,740
them a little bit and I think that's
okay.

2343
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:38,460
And a lot of this is,
you know,

2344
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,780
doctors don't want to do abortions or
you know,

2345
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:43,220
health care providers,
insurance providers don't want to pay

2346
01:45:43,221 --> 01:45:45,830
for things because of their religious
beliefs or,

2347
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:48,980
or catholic universities don't want to
do certain things.

2348
01:45:48,981 --> 01:45:51,020
And I think that,
uh,

2349
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:53,780
these are legitimate questions and we're
not really having a grown up

2350
01:45:53,781 --> 01:45:57,260
intellectual conversation about them.
We're just throwing feces at each other.

2351
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:58,700
You know,
in this particular arena.

2352
01:45:59,130 --> 01:46:01,110
Well,
it's also strange when someone comes up

2353
01:46:01,111 --> 01:46:05,940
with some sort of a new idea like that,
that goes against the separation of

2354
01:46:05,941 --> 01:46:10,941
church and state and it's being promoted
by a guy who's openly religious and says

2355
01:46:12,610 --> 01:46:15,510
about a bunch of really preposterous
things.

2356
01:46:15,930 --> 01:46:19,020
And you know,
generally someone who's not a very

2357
01:46:19,021 --> 01:46:22,830
trustworthy source of,
of intellectual discourse.

2358
01:46:23,230 --> 01:46:24,050
That's right.
And there's this,

2359
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:29,050
there's this vaccinating question about
why a white depth angelicals or trump's

2360
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:33,530
biggest support group like huge track,
despite the fact that he is not

2361
01:46:33,531 --> 01:46:36,590
religious himself,
that he's the biggest sinner ever to be

2362
01:46:36,591 --> 01:46:38,410
in the oval office.
Uh,

2363
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:42,460
but they love hIm and it's,
it's a weird thing.

2364
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:45,200
I think a lot of it comes well.
So there's,

2365
01:46:45,230 --> 01:46:49,100
there's sort of the strategic questions.
A lot of it comes down to abortion,

2366
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:51,090
right?
They want supreme court justices will

2367
01:46:51,091 --> 01:46:53,730
overturn roe v dot wade,
that then whoever,

2368
01:46:53,731 --> 01:46:55,410
however they're going to get that is
good for them.

2369
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:00,630
But then there's a whole much more
elaborate apologetics about how god is

2370
01:47:00,631 --> 01:47:05,190
using Donald Trump as his instrument to
make the country better.

2371
01:47:05,191 --> 01:47:09,300
Even if he himself is a flawed vessel.
Sometimes god works through flAwed

2372
01:47:09,301 --> 01:47:10,134
vessels.

2373
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:12,990
Well,
if you position yourself as an ally,

2374
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:16,920
even if you have previously send.
The beautiful thing about christianity

2375
01:47:16,921 --> 01:47:19,260
is all you have to do is say,
that's not me anymore.

2376
01:47:19,261 --> 01:47:24,261
I found jesus and I saw a pastor on
television going on about that and about

2377
01:47:25,531 --> 01:47:30,030
even when you're talking about trump,
you're talking about the trump before he

2378
01:47:30,031 --> 01:47:33,930
found jesus and he's like,
I don't have a past,

2379
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,730
and he was like,
I am born again.

2380
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:39,750
I do not have a past due you,
and he was going on about this whole

2381
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:44,280
thing about this concept of trump is now
an agent of god,

2382
01:47:44,570 --> 01:47:46,760
but I don't necessarily even think it's
christianity.

2383
01:47:46,761 --> 01:47:51,080
I think that religion can be infinitely
malleable to the purposes of the moment.

2384
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:54,470
He wouldn't have said that about obama
or whoever.

2385
01:47:54,471 --> 01:47:55,304
Right.
You know,

2386
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:59,120
you pick and choose when you apply your
criteria.

2387
01:47:59,121 --> 01:48:01,250
Like I,
I did this once as an exercise for

2388
01:48:01,251 --> 01:48:04,430
myself.
There's certain phrases in the bible or

2389
01:48:04,431 --> 01:48:08,900
certain passages in the bible which are
sort of unapologetically left wing and

2390
01:48:08,901 --> 01:48:09,980
socialist,
right?

2391
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:12,800
Just like there are others that are
unapologetically right wing and

2392
01:48:12,830 --> 01:48:15,200
authoritarian.
It's a big book full of different

2393
01:48:15,201 --> 01:48:17,330
things.
So I wondered like how.

2394
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:21,050
What did they tell themselves?
What do the people who don't fall in

2395
01:48:21,051 --> 01:48:23,480
that side of the spectrum tell
themselves about these passages in the

2396
01:48:23,481 --> 01:48:24,580
bible?
So there's one famous,

2397
01:48:24,581 --> 01:48:27,950
very famous passage about how it is
easier for

2398
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:32,660
a camel to pass through the eye of a
needle than for a rich man to enter the

2399
01:48:32,661 --> 01:48:33,470
kingdom of heaven.

2400
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:34,880
Right?
Clearly,

2401
01:48:34,881 --> 01:48:39,881
I think that anyone who reads this says
this is an anti rich person statement so

2402
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:43,340
you can google it.
Like so what do people say about this?

2403
01:48:43,370 --> 01:48:47,210
So my favorite explanation was that
sure,

2404
01:48:47,211 --> 01:48:50,540
it's impossible for camels to pass
through the eyes of a needle,

2405
01:48:50,610 --> 01:48:55,610
except if jesus helps them or if you
grind the camel down to dust and they

2406
01:48:58,041 --> 01:49:02,090
interpreted this as jesus said,
that only through jesus we get into

2407
01:49:02,091 --> 01:49:03,770
heaven.
That's really the only lesson they get.

2408
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:05,540
Oh,
okay.

2409
01:49:05,660 --> 01:49:08,360
So that's nothing to do with rick.
all you have to do is find jesus.

2410
01:49:08,361 --> 01:49:09,440
And if you're rich,
you're good.

2411
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:11,380
Well,
this is my time.

2412
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:13,610
This is why I can't.
Even though I'm an atheist,

2413
01:49:13,611 --> 01:49:14,444
I'm,
I'm,

2414
01:49:14,570 --> 01:49:17,240
I'm very happy to explain why I don't
think that god exists,

2415
01:49:17,570 --> 01:49:22,570
but I don't blame religion most of the
time for people's bad actions because I

2416
01:49:22,581 --> 01:49:26,510
think that religion is just sort of a
catalyst lets people find excuses for

2417
01:49:26,511 --> 01:49:29,750
their bad actions,
but it's usually the bad actions,

2418
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:31,790
the desire to do bad actions that comes
first.

2419
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:37,110
Do you ever look at religion as a
potential almost evolutionary software

2420
01:49:37,111 --> 01:49:42,111
program that's allowed people to sort of
adopt morality and impose certain

2421
01:49:43,951 --> 01:49:46,980
standards of behavior that are conducive
to.

2422
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:49,630
So people talk about that.
And again,

2423
01:49:49,631 --> 01:49:52,780
I'm not an expert there.
I a little skeptical because it sounds

2424
01:49:52,781 --> 01:49:55,600
like too much of a story to tell after
the fact.

2425
01:49:55,601 --> 01:49:58,120
Right?
I think that we are a little bit quick

2426
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:02,500
to attribute ideas and cultural concepts
to evolution.

2427
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,360
Um,
but certainly,

2428
01:50:04,361 --> 01:50:08,320
you know,
religion was not like just science done

2429
01:50:08,321 --> 01:50:09,850
badly back in the day,
right?

2430
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:13,450
Like what religion was,
was something much more expansive inter,

2431
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:18,750
inter leafed with your life overall.
So it was not just how the world was

2432
01:50:20,141 --> 01:50:23,640
created and whether god exists.
It was how to be a good person,

2433
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:25,870
how to live in your community,
things like that.

2434
01:50:26,350 --> 01:50:29,350
And you know,
disentangling these things is one of the

2435
01:50:29,351 --> 01:50:31,600
reasons why religion is still hanging
around,

2436
01:50:31,601 --> 01:50:33,650
right?
Like even after the kind of

2437
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:38,890
underpinnings of the religion in terms
of understanding how the world works had

2438
01:50:38,891 --> 01:50:40,780
been removed by science.

2439
01:50:40,990 --> 01:50:43,070
The other functions are still there and
I,

2440
01:50:43,071 --> 01:50:46,840
I'm a big critic of my fellow
naturalists who have not put enough

2441
01:50:46,841 --> 01:50:50,890
effort into replacing the other
functions of religion.

2442
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:52,660
Now that the,
uh,

2443
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:55,180
the,
the claims about the world are no longer

2444
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:58,200
viable.
That's a great way to present it.

2445
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:00,400
Yeah.
And it's,

2446
01:51:01,290 --> 01:51:04,420
it's really a problem when there's so
many versions.

2447
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:06,011
Yeah.
So,

2448
01:51:06,011 --> 01:51:06,880
I mean,
one of the many,

2449
01:51:06,881 --> 01:51:11,650
many reasons why I think that it's not
really credible to be religious

2450
01:51:11,651 --> 01:51:16,651
intellectually is because if in the
classic traditional western religious

2451
01:51:17,291 --> 01:51:20,140
sense where there's a god and he cares
about us,

2452
01:51:20,170 --> 01:51:22,120
right?
So there's all sorts of questions about

2453
01:51:22,121 --> 01:51:23,650
where we define the boundary of
religion,

2454
01:51:23,651 --> 01:51:25,810
whether buddhism is a religion or
something like that.

2455
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:29,560
But in the usual sense that we,
that we grew up with in this country,

2456
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:34,950
I'm surely if that were true,
god would have done a much better job of

2457
01:51:35,051 --> 01:51:37,060
explaining himself to us.

2458
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:40,300
Right?
Like why would god give us his message

2459
01:51:40,301 --> 01:51:44,140
through a bunch of people in a tiny
country who didn't write?

2460
01:51:44,170 --> 01:51:46,270
You know,
like the new testament wasn't written

2461
01:51:46,271 --> 01:51:49,450
down until decades after the event.
None of the people who wrote it down

2462
01:51:49,451 --> 01:51:52,030
were eye witnesses.
Why is it only shared there?

2463
01:51:52,031 --> 01:51:52,560
I mean,
god,

2464
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,240
it's god is god.
Right?

2465
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:57,160
Like he could easily have showed up.
Everybody in the world talk to them and

2466
01:51:57,161 --> 01:51:59,680
explain how things were going and let
them make their own choices.

2467
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:02,980
That would have been a much more
efficient way of getting the message

2468
01:52:02,981 --> 01:52:06,070
out.
And so it's just not really sensible to

2469
01:52:06,071 --> 01:52:08,410
think that.
So if god didn't exist,

2470
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:11,200
then what you would imagine is that in
different countries,

2471
01:52:11,201 --> 01:52:13,840
in different parts of the world,
in different periods in history,

2472
01:52:13,841 --> 01:52:16,680
people would tell their own stories and
they'd all be a little bit different and

2473
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:18,550
they'd be adaptive there,
local circumstances,

2474
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:20,740
and they'd be utterly incompatible with
each other.

2475
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:25,540
And that's exactly what you find.
Do you speculate as to what the origins

2476
01:52:25,541 --> 01:52:30,100
of the concept of god are since so many
different groups of people all over the

2477
01:52:30,101 --> 01:52:35,101
world have a very similar idea,
at least that there's some omnipotent

2478
01:52:35,690 --> 01:52:39,220
superpower that's controlling the
destiny of everything?

2479
01:52:39,790 --> 01:52:40,930
Yeah.
So number one,

2480
01:52:40,931 --> 01:52:44,680
I think that the idea of omnipotence was
actually somewhat late coming onto the

2481
01:52:44,681 --> 01:52:45,411
scene,
right?

2482
01:52:45,411 --> 01:52:47,840
Like if you dig into,
uh,

2483
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:50,540
what was happening before 2000 years
ago,

2484
01:52:50,740 --> 01:52:51,440
um,
you know,

2485
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:54,620
the hebrew god was not omnipotent at the
beginning,

2486
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:55,483
right?
I mean,

2487
01:52:55,610 --> 01:52:59,150
the hebrews came out of a polytheistic
society where there were lots of

2488
01:52:59,151 --> 01:53:04,151
different gods around and you can trace
how their god evolved over time and

2489
01:53:04,191 --> 01:53:04,911
first,
you know,

2490
01:53:04,911 --> 01:53:06,860
became their god,
right?

2491
01:53:06,861 --> 01:53:10,010
Like there was one god that the,
that the hebrews were,

2492
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:10,933
uh,
you know,

2493
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:14,630
a worshiping and the egyptians and the
babylonians and worship other gods.

2494
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:15,860
Then they started saying,
well,

2495
01:53:15,861 --> 01:53:17,690
our god is better than all the other
ones.

2496
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:18,830
And then they started saying,
well,

2497
01:53:18,831 --> 01:53:20,240
the other ones don't even exist.
Right?

2498
01:53:20,241 --> 01:53:23,840
And it was an evolution over time and
omnipotence came late,

2499
01:53:23,870 --> 01:53:27,590
like you would talk about the gods
quarreling if you were a polytheistic

2500
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:31,040
pagan culture.
It's actually makes more like a lot of

2501
01:53:31,041 --> 01:53:33,320
the world makes more sense if you
believe there's a whole bunch of gods

2502
01:53:33,321 --> 01:53:35,360
out there who disagree with each other,
right?

2503
01:53:35,570 --> 01:53:38,540
Suddenly lots of aspects of realities
come into focus.

2504
01:53:39,530 --> 01:53:41,210
But the idea,
there's supernatural,

2505
01:53:41,211 --> 01:53:44,960
very powerful influences in the.
I mean,

2506
01:53:44,961 --> 01:53:48,650
that's just an obvious idea.
I think like we're human beings,

2507
01:53:48,651 --> 01:53:51,080
we tend to,
as our first guest and understanding the

2508
01:53:51,081 --> 01:53:53,620
world,
treat the world as,

2509
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:55,240
you know,
humanists,

2510
01:53:55,270 --> 01:53:56,210
like we're,
we're,

2511
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,990
we're anthropomorphic,
right?

2512
01:53:58,160 --> 01:53:59,600
Like,
if something exists,

2513
01:53:59,601 --> 01:54:01,490
it must have been designed.
There must be a reason,

2514
01:54:01,491 --> 01:54:02,480
there must be a purpose.

2515
01:54:02,510 --> 01:54:04,910
Uh,
things work in a certain way because

2516
01:54:04,911 --> 01:54:08,900
someone made them that way and that we
don't see that person hanging around,

2517
01:54:08,901 --> 01:54:09,950
so it must be,
you know,

2518
01:54:09,951 --> 01:54:13,100
up there in the sky or something.
I don't think it's that hard to imagine

2519
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:15,410
that all sorts of different cultures
would evolve.

2520
01:54:15,470 --> 01:54:18,980
Do you think it's also a function of us
growing up with mentors and father

2521
01:54:18,981 --> 01:54:23,870
figures and leaders and chieftains and
there's always someone who is the big,

2522
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:27,800
the big kahuna.
So this is the sky daddy.

2523
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:30,410
Yeah.
Sky daddy overlooks the big picture.

2524
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:33,620
I think there's that.
And also the idea of your ancestors and

2525
01:54:33,621 --> 01:54:35,630
ancestor worship or veneration.
Right.

2526
01:54:35,631 --> 01:54:38,930
Which is also very almost universal,
you know,

2527
01:54:38,931 --> 01:54:40,160
in,
in primitive cultures,

2528
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:42,410
I'm like,
you don't want to admit you died.

2529
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:44,780
Right.
That's a sad thing to sit through.

2530
01:54:44,781 --> 01:54:47,480
So I don't know.
I'm sure they're real experts who know a

2531
01:54:47,481 --> 01:54:49,610
lot about the actual origins of these
things,

2532
01:54:49,611 --> 01:54:52,580
but,
but my point is just that I don't take

2533
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:57,230
the commonalities between different sets
of religious beliefs as evidence for

2534
01:54:57,260 --> 01:54:59,990
anything other than there's a very human
thing to invent.

2535
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:05,590
People search for meaning and they take
meaning from what or whatever religion

2536
01:55:07,971 --> 01:55:12,971
or ideology that they subscribe to and
they use it as a sort of a reason why

2537
01:55:16,581 --> 01:55:18,740
they're living.
It gives them hope.

2538
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:20,540
It gives them,
gives them something.

2539
01:55:20,541 --> 01:55:24,710
Yeah.
It's a very common theme among religious

2540
01:55:24,711 --> 01:55:28,550
thinkers that if it weren't for the
existence of god or whatever,

2541
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:31,430
there'd be no reason to live.
There'd be no reason to be a good person

2542
01:55:31,490 --> 01:55:32,900
and so forth.
And you know,

2543
01:55:32,901 --> 01:55:36,020
I think it's a,
it goes back to the motivation we have

2544
01:55:36,021 --> 01:55:38,240
as having bodies versus being in a
computer.

2545
01:55:38,241 --> 01:55:40,670
Like there's plenty of reasons to do
different things.

2546
01:55:40,671 --> 01:55:41,780
Like in,
in the big picture.

2547
01:55:41,781 --> 01:55:44,220
My last book,
I talk a lot about,

2548
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,850
um,
you know,

2549
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:46,510
we,
we,

2550
01:55:46,510 --> 01:55:50,670
it's okay to admit that we as human
beings have desires that we,

2551
01:55:50,671 --> 01:55:53,400
there are things we care about,
that we want to be true.

2552
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:56,310
And you can talk about why that's true
from evolution,

2553
01:55:56,311 --> 01:55:59,190
from biology and whatever,
but it doesn't matter why in some sense

2554
01:55:59,370 --> 01:56:01,920
we have goals.
We are not completely aimless.

2555
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:04,080
Like we want to survive.
We want to flourish.

2556
01:56:04,081 --> 01:56:06,870
We want to be friends with people,
we want to have families or whatever it

2557
01:56:06,871 --> 01:56:11,871
is we want to do all that we put
together in terms of morality and ethics

2558
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:17,540
and meaning and purpose comes out of
thinking hard and carefully,

2559
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:19,960
hopefully about,
uh,

2560
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:24,980
how to systematize and grow those
existing desires that we have into a way

2561
01:56:25,171 --> 01:56:28,200
of living in the world.
We don't need anything external to make

2562
01:56:28,201 --> 01:56:30,810
that happen.
We just need to sort of think about

2563
01:56:30,811 --> 01:56:32,910
where we are already and try to make it
better.

2564
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:38,800
But you as an intelligent person who's
also an atheist who thinks very deeply

2565
01:56:38,961 --> 01:56:43,961
about things,
what do you cling to as a purpose for

2566
01:56:45,291 --> 01:56:47,960
life?
Do you have one to have like,

2567
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:49,880
uh,
when you sit and think like,

2568
01:56:49,881 --> 01:56:52,010
what's the point of all this?
Do you,

2569
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:53,260
do you.

2570
01:56:53,260 --> 01:56:55,660
I don't have a single one.
I don't have a monolithic purpose.

2571
01:56:55,661 --> 01:56:57,790
I have plenty of intermediate sized
purposes,

2572
01:56:57,791 --> 01:56:59,380
right?
Um,

2573
01:56:59,470 --> 01:57:00,191
otherwise,
you know,

2574
01:57:00,191 --> 01:57:01,720
why continue living?
I think that,

2575
01:57:01,721 --> 01:57:04,750
uh,
there's plenty of things I want to do to

2576
01:57:04,751 --> 01:57:06,160
achieve,
to experience,

2577
01:57:06,190 --> 01:57:08,110
to share,
to give to the world,

2578
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:09,160
right?
That's big

2579
01:57:09,210 --> 01:57:09,961
feature,
right?

2580
01:57:09,961 --> 01:57:12,380
They give to the world that you're your
inner ear,

2581
01:57:12,630 --> 01:57:15,930
the way you interact with other human
beings and your effect on other human

2582
01:57:15,931 --> 01:57:18,990
beings gives you a,
gives you purpose.

2583
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:21,600
Yeah.
And even if I think that when I die,

2584
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:24,000
I will no longer exist in my feelings,
won't matter.

2585
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:27,990
I have feelings right now about what the
world would be like even after I'm not

2586
01:57:27,991 --> 01:57:29,040
here anymore.
Right.

2587
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:33,780
So I can still be motivated to make the
world a better place in ways that will

2588
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:36,420
outlive me.
Even if I think that when I die,

2589
01:57:36,421 --> 01:57:37,440
it's really the end for me.

2590
01:57:37,970 --> 01:57:42,970
Hm.
And do you get down sometimes?

2591
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:46,300
Do you ever do,
do you get like these periods of like,

2592
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:48,410
you're like,
what is the purpose of all this?

2593
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:53,020
Especially if you see some ridiculous
thing in the news or some horrific

2594
01:57:53,021 --> 01:57:54,870
tragedy.
And I'm

2595
01:57:55,190 --> 01:57:56,480
pretty,
I mean,

2596
01:57:56,510 --> 01:57:59,470
so for horrific tragedies.
No,

2597
01:57:59,530 --> 01:58:00,370
I'm,
I'm,

2598
01:58:00,470 --> 01:58:01,480
I'm just,
you know,

2599
01:58:01,850 --> 01:58:06,620
fortunate enough to be a pretty even
keeled when it comes to that stuff I

2600
01:58:06,621 --> 01:58:08,780
don't have,
I don't struggle with depression or

2601
01:58:08,781 --> 01:58:11,570
despair or existential anxiety or
anything like that.

2602
01:58:11,930 --> 01:58:13,340
Uh,
when I was a kid,

2603
01:58:13,341 --> 01:58:17,360
when I was first starting thinking about
the universe and science and things like

2604
01:58:17,361 --> 01:58:19,700
that,
I would start wondering about,

2605
01:58:19,701 --> 01:58:21,320
well,
what if the universe hadn't existed at

2606
01:58:21,321 --> 01:58:22,610
all?
What if I weren't,

2607
01:58:22,690 --> 01:58:24,040
wasn't here,
uh,

2608
01:58:24,041 --> 01:58:27,950
and that may be loose sleep that night.
And I think like many people there,

2609
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:32,510
there was a very definite moment when I
realized that I and everyone I knew

2610
01:58:32,511 --> 01:58:33,650
would die,
right?

2611
01:58:33,651 --> 01:58:35,870
and that,
so I woke up crying and my mom had to,

2612
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:38,720
you know,
a comfort me because like,

2613
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:39,770
I was like,
you know,

2614
01:58:39,870 --> 01:58:42,430
grand mom's gonna die and you're going
to die and I'm going to die.

2615
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:43,550
And you know,
yeah.

2616
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:44,381
But,
you know,

2617
01:58:44,381 --> 01:58:45,510
as a grownup,
no,

2618
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:46,650
I think that,
uh,

2619
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:48,640
you know,
I'm more or less.

2620
01:58:49,090 --> 01:58:52,690
So once again,
one of the future podcast guests that,

2621
01:58:52,710 --> 01:58:56,830
uh,
I'll be a next week's podcast will be by

2622
01:58:56,831 --> 01:58:59,140
a woman who was part of the death
positive movement.

2623
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:01,640
Have you heard about this?
Yeah,

2624
01:59:02,050 --> 01:59:03,830
this is real stuff.
What,

2625
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:06,340
who,
so don't distinguish,

2626
01:59:06,341 --> 01:59:07,180
don't,
don't confuse it.

2627
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:09,790
There is a whole movement,
like an anti natal this movie or

2628
01:59:09,791 --> 01:59:11,050
something like that.
Forget what they call themselves,

2629
01:59:11,051 --> 01:59:13,960
but there's a whole movement that wants
human beings not to exist.

2630
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:17,170
That's crazy,
but there are people who like that the

2631
01:59:17,171 --> 01:59:18,740
death positive movement is the
following,

2632
01:59:18,741 --> 01:59:21,190
like we're going to die.
We should face up to it,

2633
01:59:21,850 --> 01:59:26,850
we should accept it and we should deal
with it in a personally and culturally

2634
01:59:27,310 --> 01:59:29,980
positive way.
So for example,

2635
01:59:29,981 --> 01:59:31,780
like right now,
especially in the United States,

2636
01:59:31,810 --> 01:59:34,150
even compared to europe or other
countries,

2637
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:36,190
we're terrible at dealing with death.

2638
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:40,270
We put people in hospitals,
we take them away from their families,

2639
01:59:40,271 --> 01:59:44,140
away from their homes.
We refuse to admit that they're going to

2640
01:59:44,141 --> 01:59:47,650
die.
So we treat it as if the whole purpose

2641
01:59:47,651 --> 01:59:51,280
of the game is to squeeze out as many
more hours of life as possible,

2642
01:59:51,281 --> 01:59:53,350
no matter what,
the quality of that life is,

2643
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:56,080
um,
and all that is just rubbish.

2644
01:59:56,081 --> 01:59:58,450
And we should be much more grown up
about it.

2645
01:59:58,451 --> 02:00:00,610
We should plan ahead.
You know,

2646
02:00:00,611 --> 02:00:01,460
when,
uh,

2647
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:04,390
obama suggested that in the healthcare
system,

2648
02:00:04,391 --> 02:00:07,360
there should be some planning for what
happens when you die.

2649
02:00:07,361 --> 02:00:10,600
Sarah pailin came along with death
panels and that was a very effective

2650
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:14,230
rhetorical strategy.
We don't want to think about the fact

2651
02:00:14,231 --> 02:00:16,330
that we're going to die.
We don't want to plan for it.

2652
02:00:16,660 --> 02:00:19,330
If we did plan for it,
it could be better.

2653
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:22,690
We could die at home,
we could die with less pain,

2654
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:26,620
we might not live as long as we don't
like do every single medical

2655
02:00:26,621 --> 02:00:29,500
intervention possible just to squeeze
out a few more breaths.

2656
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:34,830
But it could be a much more life
affirming experience to die because the

2657
02:00:35,201 --> 02:00:37,630
people around us who,
who are there,

2658
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:40,510
uh,
come across with an acceptance of what's

2659
02:00:40,511 --> 02:00:43,360
going on rather than the feeling that we
should just do everything we can to

2660
02:00:43,361 --> 02:00:44,194
prevent.

2661
02:00:44,730 --> 02:00:49,440
I had a similar situation happened
recently with a dog of mine who was a

2662
02:00:49,450 --> 02:00:53,760
massive,
reached 13 years old and from massive.

2663
02:00:53,761 --> 02:00:58,290
So it's very old and we had to put him
down because he couldn't walk anymore.

2664
02:00:58,680 --> 02:00:59,730
And uh,
he was,

2665
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:05,370
it was brutally painful to watch him try
to get up and fall down and,

2666
02:01:05,430 --> 02:01:07,160
you know,
um,

2667
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:12,300
but one of the things I was thinking was
that if this is my grandfather and not

2668
02:01:12,301 --> 02:01:17,070
my dog,
I would have to watch him suffer until

2669
02:01:17,071 --> 02:01:18,390
the bitter end.
Yeah.

2670
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:21,990
I knew this dog wasn't going to go
backwards in time and become a puppy

2671
02:01:21,991 --> 02:01:22,950
again.
Right.

2672
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:26,550
And knew his days were numbered.
He couldn't do anything.

2673
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:29,970
Most days he just slept all day until it
was time to eat.

2674
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:32,790
But it was getting to the point where I
had to carry him to his food.

2675
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:33,950
Yeah.
And I knew that

2676
02:01:34,220 --> 02:01:35,490
there's no quality of life,
right?

2677
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:36,870
No quality of life.
ANd it's,

2678
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:39,320
in some sense it's even harder with the
dog because you can't talk them.

2679
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,910
Right.
You can't explain to them what's going

2680
02:01:40,911 --> 02:01:42,170
on.
They can't explain to you what their

2681
02:01:42,171 --> 02:01:44,750
wishes are.
So you have to be the responsible one.

2682
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:47,810
But yeah.
So everything legally and culturally in

2683
02:01:47,811 --> 02:01:52,370
the United States is we're not allowed
to relieve that pain or that,

2684
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,650
that despair that you have in the end of
your life.

2685
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:56,900
Some states,
including California,

2686
02:01:56,901 --> 02:02:01,370
are passing death with dignity laws
where basically it's what used to be

2687
02:02:01,371 --> 02:02:03,680
called assisted suicide,
but we don't call it that anymore.

2688
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:07,880
I'm a you.
A doctor is allowed to give you the

2689
02:02:07,881 --> 02:02:10,880
means to end your own life when you're.
When you're near,

2690
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:12,770
you have to be near a point of no
return,

2691
02:02:12,771 --> 02:02:15,620
but still clearly thinking enough to be
able to make that decision

2692
02:02:15,650 --> 02:02:20,650
for yourself and there's also an issue
with our real concern is their fear and

2693
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:28,460
their this,
this experience being this terrifying

2694
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:33,550
sort of step into the great beyond and
there's a tool to mitigate that and the

2695
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:40,430
tool that has been shown to mitigate
that as psychedelics.

2696
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:45,440
One of the big ones being psilocybin.
Psilocybin has a remarkable effect on

2697
02:02:45,441 --> 02:02:50,441
people that are going through stage four
cancer and a johns hopkins is studied

2698
02:02:51,111 --> 02:02:51,650
it.
There's,

2699
02:02:51,650 --> 02:02:54,950
there's,
there's quite a few studies that have

2700
02:02:54,951 --> 02:02:58,640
shown that people,
when you give them psilocybin,

2701
02:02:58,730 --> 02:03:03,730
they they're much more relaxed and much
more comfortable with this idea of

2702
02:03:05,091 --> 02:03:07,730
ending this life of this life.
You know,

2703
02:03:07,820 --> 02:03:09,800
it's gone through its course and get
this.

2704
02:03:09,950 --> 02:03:14,480
It's an inevitable thing and it's really
our biological limitations that are

2705
02:03:14,481 --> 02:03:19,481
terrified and sparking up all of these
intense primal fears of the end.

2706
02:03:20,390 --> 02:03:22,700
YeAh.
I'm actually a 100 percent in agreement

2707
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:24,980
there.
My wife jennifer will lead to is a

2708
02:03:24,981 --> 02:03:27,740
science writer,
wrote a book called me and myself and

2709
02:03:27,741 --> 02:03:31,250
why searching for the science of self
and uh,

2710
02:03:31,251 --> 02:03:32,600
one of our friends said,
oh,

2711
02:03:32,601 --> 02:03:33,790
if you're gonna write a book about the
self,

2712
02:03:33,791 --> 02:03:37,940
you got to do lsd.
And so we did and she researched it.

2713
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,250
And uh,
it's a fascinating history,

2714
02:03:40,251 --> 02:03:40,950
right?
And,

2715
02:03:40,950 --> 02:03:42,410
uh,
eldest huxley,

2716
02:03:42,411 --> 02:03:46,580
I don't know if you know about how this
whole story and he took lsd to do

2717
02:03:46,581 --> 02:03:50,060
exactly this.
He had throat cancer and it completely

2718
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:51,800
helped you.
It's never fun to die,

2719
02:03:51,801 --> 02:03:54,590
right?
But it absolutely helped ease that

2720
02:03:54,591 --> 02:03:59,591
journey in a very simple way,
but just as we are a sort of immature

2721
02:04:00,051 --> 02:04:05,000
society that doesn't want to face up to
the reality of our eventual deaths were

2722
02:04:05,001 --> 02:04:08,090
also very culturally conservative and
squeamish about drugs.

2723
02:04:08,091 --> 02:04:09,610
Right.
And so were.

2724
02:04:09,611 --> 02:04:12,530
We don't even let people do research on
some of these drugs.

2725
02:04:12,531 --> 02:04:13,670
and so I think that,
yeah,

2726
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:16,160
we have a lot of growing up to do when
it comes to,

2727
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:18,380
uh,
not just living a good life,

2728
02:04:18,381 --> 02:04:20,900
but also having a good death and also so

2729
02:04:20,950 --> 02:04:25,480
paying attention to actual scientists
who have studied these compounds and

2730
02:04:25,481 --> 02:04:30,481
really understand what the effects of
them are and have researched them deeply

2731
02:04:30,731 --> 02:04:33,510
and have personal experiences with them
and they're saying these,

2732
02:04:33,610 --> 02:04:36,400
the,
these things have been demonized and

2733
02:04:36,401 --> 02:04:38,190
there are tools that we can use

2734
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:40,800
to sort of mitigate a lot of the real
issues that we have,

2735
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:45,210
whether it's culturally or personally
with these transitionary times,

2736
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:48,600
like death is inevitable.
So now that we know it's inevitable,

2737
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:53,610
you tell me what the main problem would
be with someone taking psilocybin before

2738
02:04:53,611 --> 02:04:56,880
they die and letting them ease their way
through this.

2739
02:04:57,120 --> 02:05:00,420
But you know,
it's the same reaction that doesn't want

2740
02:05:00,421 --> 02:05:02,360
people to have a basic income,
right?

2741
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:06,690
There is a sort of moral feeling that
you're weak.

2742
02:05:07,170 --> 02:05:09,690
You don't struggle against dad
everything.

2743
02:05:09,691 --> 02:05:10,770
And it's silly,
right?

2744
02:05:10,771 --> 02:05:12,330
It's no sense,
but it's very,

2745
02:05:12,331 --> 02:05:14,670
very common.
It's so weird that,

2746
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:18,870
that,
that the universal basic income topic is

2747
02:05:18,871 --> 02:05:21,120
one of those knee jerk reaction or
topics that I,

2748
02:05:21,121 --> 02:05:23,040
myself,
my friend eddie wong,

2749
02:05:23,310 --> 02:05:26,350
have introduced it to me for the first
time and I,

2750
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:28,770
my initial knee jerk reaction was,
ah,

2751
02:05:28,771 --> 02:05:29,880
you can't do that to people.

2752
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:32,030
Human nature,
people are going to get lazy.

2753
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:34,050
And then the more I thought about it,
I was like,

2754
02:05:34,051 --> 02:05:36,840
well,
if you just cover their food and their

2755
02:05:36,841 --> 02:05:38,340
rent,
are they really going to get,

2756
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:40,380
is it really going to kill their
ambition?

2757
02:05:40,381 --> 02:05:42,690
Like why would that kill it?
Is our own ambition,

2758
02:05:42,950 --> 02:05:46,920
our ambition uniquely tied to just
survival.

2759
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:48,840
That doesn't make sense.
Well,

2760
02:05:48,841 --> 02:05:51,270
and it's a weird.
It's the same weird thing that people

2761
02:05:51,271 --> 02:05:52,440
use against,
you know,

2762
02:05:52,470 --> 02:05:54,600
having a progressive tax system.
Like if we have,

2763
02:05:54,770 --> 02:05:57,660
we tax people's money,
they won't want to work anymore,

2764
02:05:58,140 --> 02:05:59,710
but you know,
if you know,

2765
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:02,340
you still want more money,
we don't them so much that you have less

2766
02:06:02,341 --> 02:06:04,200
money to work.
That's not how it works.

2767
02:06:04,201 --> 02:06:06,390
And I think like what,
so but,

2768
02:06:06,420 --> 02:06:09,420
but also for the,
for the universal basic income stuff,

2769
02:06:09,421 --> 02:06:10,890
I think people have to reconcile
themselves.

2770
02:06:11,190 --> 02:06:15,180
So what if someone wants to just sit
around and play video games all day,

2771
02:06:15,230 --> 02:06:17,220
brian,
is that the worst thing in the world?

2772
02:06:17,250 --> 02:06:18,083
Like,
I mean,

2773
02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:20,100
I think that there will be people like
that.

2774
02:06:20,101 --> 02:06:24,450
There will still be other people who
want to write poetry and build sailboats

2775
02:06:24,451 --> 02:06:26,270
and you know,
build a spacecraft,

2776
02:06:26,330 --> 02:06:28,230
et cetera,
or build artificial intelligence.

2777
02:06:28,231 --> 02:06:30,960
And you wouldn't.
What if everyone could do whatever they

2778
02:06:30,961 --> 02:06:32,850
want when they were kids when they're 10
years old,

2779
02:06:32,851 --> 02:06:34,620
they were,
they were taught a good programming

2780
02:06:34,621 --> 02:06:35,720
language and could,
you know,

2781
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:37,740
make up whatever apps and programs they
wanted.

2782
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:41,190
Like there'll be a whole different world
than what we live in right now.

2783
02:06:41,250 --> 02:06:43,050
And it might be very exciting.
Well,

2784
02:06:43,051 --> 02:06:48,000
creatively it could possibly expand a
lot of people's potentials,

2785
02:06:48,001 --> 02:06:50,880
right?
Where they no longer have to have a job.

2786
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:55,410
So they could do whatever this one thing
is that they're thinking about doing.

2787
02:06:55,410 --> 02:07:00,120
Write a book or a screenplay,
develop something in the short term.

2788
02:07:00,121 --> 02:07:02,790
I don't know if a basic income work sort
of economically,

2789
02:07:02,791 --> 02:07:06,270
but I think that if we believe that
there's more and more stuff that can be

2790
02:07:06,271 --> 02:07:09,660
done by computers,
by robots or whatever automation,

2791
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:12,780
then it's absolutely something that
should be taken seriously.

2792
02:07:12,781 --> 02:07:14,640
Yeah.
So I think that this is the whole thing,

2793
02:07:14,641 --> 02:07:17,280
and this is great because we've been
talking a lot of different angles about

2794
02:07:17,281 --> 02:07:22,281
the fact that the shape of the world is
changing in a way that makes what it

2795
02:07:22,471 --> 02:07:25,350
means to be human changing and,
uh,

2796
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:28,720
facing up to what those changes are,
the fact that we died,

2797
02:07:28,721 --> 02:07:30,810
in fact,
we make up purpose and meaning for

2798
02:07:30,811 --> 02:07:35,811
ourselves and in our lives and the fact
that what we are physically in terms

2799
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:39,280
of bodies and,
and machines and so forth is Also

2800
02:07:39,281 --> 02:07:41,920
changing.
So in this part of the theme of my

2801
02:07:41,921 --> 02:07:43,420
podcast,
I hope is that,

2802
02:07:43,450 --> 02:07:45,970
uh,
to think through some of these issues to

2803
02:07:45,971 --> 02:07:47,590
sort of.
I don't know the answers,

2804
02:07:47,830 --> 02:07:49,470
but I want to ask the questions about,
you know,

2805
02:07:49,630 --> 02:07:50,850
who we are,
what we're living,

2806
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:53,050
what should we be doing about it?
Because god's not going to give us the

2807
02:07:53,051 --> 02:07:54,280
answer.
Well,

2808
02:07:54,370 --> 02:07:54,980
I think

2809
02:07:54,980 --> 02:07:59,980
podcasts like yours and I mean any
podcasts where people are really

2810
02:08:01,460 --> 02:08:06,460
carefully considering issues there,
I think what's important about them that

2811
02:08:06,860 --> 02:08:11,860
really didn't exist before is that
someone can sort of digest these very

2812
02:08:12,951 --> 02:08:17,951
complex subjects through to people
having a conversation about it that

2813
02:08:18,261 --> 02:08:23,030
perhaps are more informed and have more
data and have more experience and have

2814
02:08:23,031 --> 02:08:25,850
more thought about these particular
issues.

2815
02:08:26,210 --> 02:08:30,050
So what you can do and what sam harris
can do in a lot of people can do that

2816
02:08:30,051 --> 02:08:32,870
are creating these podcasts about these
really complex issues,

2817
02:08:32,871 --> 02:08:37,871
is you start that conversation and this
seed gets planted into someone's head

2818
02:08:38,901 --> 02:08:41,360
and maybe they carry with them at work.
They carry with them,

2819
02:08:41,690 --> 02:08:44,900
carry it with them when they're on the
subway or during the commute home,

2820
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:48,380
and then they become a part of the
broader conversation that we have as a

2821
02:08:48,381 --> 02:08:48,930
couple.

2822
02:08:48,930 --> 02:08:49,651
Exactly.
Yeah,

2823
02:08:49,651 --> 02:08:53,970
and that'S why I sort of want to not
draw a distinction between science and

2824
02:08:53,971 --> 02:08:56,190
other ways of thinking deeply about the
world.

2825
02:08:56,191 --> 02:08:58,720
Because I want people to.
You know,

2826
02:08:58,760 --> 02:09:00,570
I.
I've often said this as a joke,

2827
02:09:00,571 --> 02:09:04,410
I want to live in a world where people
work hard in the factory and they go out

2828
02:09:04,411 --> 02:09:07,170
for a drink afterwards and talk about
their favorite interpretation of quantum

2829
02:09:07,171 --> 02:09:08,070
mechanics.
Right.

2830
02:09:08,690 --> 02:09:11,940
I want that to be the kind of thing
people are bullshitting about,

2831
02:09:11,941 --> 02:09:12,780
you know,
over beer.

2832
02:09:13,110 --> 02:09:14,790
That'd be a world I want to live in is
that.

2833
02:09:15,230 --> 02:09:18,600
Have you ever run into a quantum
mechanics conversation at a bar?

2834
02:09:18,690 --> 02:09:21,180
There are far too many people who think
they understand something about quantum

2835
02:09:21,181 --> 02:09:22,650
mechanics and are going to explain it to
me.

2836
02:09:22,651 --> 02:09:27,540
So I'm at the existing conversations to
be a little bit more informed.

2837
02:09:27,710 --> 02:09:28,670
Yeah.
Well it's.

2838
02:09:28,930 --> 02:09:30,810
There's a few people online.

2839
02:09:31,150 --> 02:09:33,460
Someone has.
You got to get this guy on and then I've

2840
02:09:33,850 --> 02:09:36,520
listened to them talk and I'm like,
I'm pretty sure

2841
02:09:37,270 --> 02:09:40,710
that that guy's full of shit,
but I can't really point out how I know

2842
02:09:40,711 --> 02:09:42,750
that a lot of crack,
but feel free to email me.

2843
02:09:42,751 --> 02:09:44,500
I will help you out if a.
Well,

2844
02:09:44,610 --> 02:09:46,230
I don't want to bring this one guy up
on,

2845
02:09:46,380 --> 02:09:48,030
but I'll talk to you about it the year.
Yeah,

2846
02:09:48,270 --> 02:09:52,140
there's a lot of woo out there,
but also it's quantum mechanics,

2847
02:09:52,141 --> 02:09:56,010
a lot of very respectable people who
sound crazy if you don't know too deeply

2848
02:09:56,011 --> 02:09:56,970
what they're,
what they're saying.

2849
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,520
So that is the fineman quote,
right?

2850
02:09:59,521 --> 02:10:01,230
If you think,
you know quantum mechanics,

2851
02:10:01,231 --> 02:10:03,070
you definitely don't know quantum
mechanics exactly.

2852
02:10:03,090 --> 02:10:07,530
Which is the whole point of my book is
to overcome that feeling because I think

2853
02:10:07,531 --> 02:10:08,760
what happened is,
you know,

2854
02:10:08,761 --> 02:10:11,520
it's true that we don't agree.
We physicists don't agree in what

2855
02:10:11,521 --> 02:10:15,780
quantum mechanics says,
but we now fetishize the fact that we

2856
02:10:15,781 --> 02:10:16,530
don't understand it.

2857
02:10:16,530 --> 02:10:18,300
Like it's good that we don't understand
it.

2858
02:10:18,330 --> 02:10:20,250
Like if you try to understand it too
hard,

2859
02:10:20,251 --> 02:10:21,890
you're wasting your time.
And I,

2860
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:26,670
I so disagree with that view.
So I think the quantum mechanics is and

2861
02:10:26,671 --> 02:10:30,120
should be understandable by everybody.
What a squirrely concept.

2862
02:10:30,930 --> 02:10:31,980
It's,
it's.

2863
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:32,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

2864
02:10:33,250 --> 02:10:35,720
It's weird and that's why I'm a lot of
people.

2865
02:10:35,830 --> 02:10:39,650
There's a lot of people who I know who
friends of mine who are professors in

2866
02:10:39,651 --> 02:10:44,651
philosophy departments because they got
a phd in physics and they realized what

2867
02:10:45,141 --> 02:10:48,170
they really wanted to do was to think
about quantum mechanics in a deep way

2868
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:51,260
and they would never get a job in a
physics department doing that to put

2869
02:10:51,261 --> 02:10:53,930
philosophy would let them do it.
Oh wow.

2870
02:10:54,020 --> 02:10:55,220
Yeah.
Interesting.

2871
02:10:55,270 --> 02:10:57,170
And what they're really doing is
physics,

2872
02:10:57,590 --> 02:11:00,140
but they're doing it in a way that
philosophers are happy with and

2873
02:11:00,141 --> 02:11:00,590
physicists.

2874
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:05,450
And what year did the concept of quantum
mechanics become invented?

2875
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:08,780
Invented in test.
And it started in 1900.

2876
02:11:08,781 --> 02:11:11,690
Exactly,
but they sort of perfected the modern

2877
02:11:11,691 --> 02:11:13,310
version around 19,
27.

2878
02:11:13,770 --> 02:11:16,790
What was the original thought process,
do you know?

2879
02:11:16,970 --> 02:11:17,900
Yeah,
it's a.

2880
02:11:17,910 --> 02:11:22,910
It was the.
The history is amazing and a messy

2881
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:26,300
because they didn't have so much
weirdness going on.

2882
02:11:26,301 --> 02:11:30,020
It was max plunk plunk radiation if you
ever heard of that.

2883
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:32,840
No,
I'm a german physicist.

2884
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:36,290
So black body radiation,
something glows when you heat it up.

2885
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:39,170
Right?
So basically what happens when you heat

2886
02:11:39,171 --> 02:11:42,230
something up is all the atoms and
molecules start vibrating.

2887
02:11:42,590 --> 02:11:46,670
There's a lot of charged particles.
A charged particle has an electric field

2888
02:11:46,730 --> 02:11:48,320
around it,
and if you vibrate it,

2889
02:11:48,350 --> 02:11:52,040
the electric field starts vibrating.
We call that light or radiation,

2890
02:11:52,041 --> 02:11:52,970
right?
Gravity.

2891
02:11:53,210 --> 02:11:54,750
Electromagnetic waves are being
admitted.

2892
02:11:55,850 --> 02:12:00,020
So you could in the year 1900,
you could sit down and do a calculation.

2893
02:12:00,290 --> 02:12:01,710
What should that look like?
You know,

2894
02:12:01,730 --> 02:12:04,820
if you heed everything up,
how much radiation should it give off?

2895
02:12:05,330 --> 02:12:08,680
And there the problem was it should give
off an infant amount of radiation at

2896
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:11,300
very long wavelength,
which is obviously false,

2897
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:13,250
right?
Because obviously not how things really

2898
02:12:13,251 --> 02:12:16,280
work.
So there was this blatant disagreement

2899
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:21,280
between everything we thought we knew.
And then in the late 19th century,

2900
02:12:21,281 --> 02:12:25,130
in the 18 hundreds,
people really thought in physics that

2901
02:12:25,131 --> 02:12:27,260
they were close to the answer,
right?

2902
02:12:27,290 --> 02:12:30,830
They had a picture where there were
particles like electrons and protons.

2903
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:33,650
And then there were fields like the
electromagnetic field and the

2904
02:12:33,651 --> 02:12:36,500
gravitational field.
And the particles were matter and the

2905
02:12:36,501 --> 02:12:38,900
fields push them together.
They interacted,

2906
02:12:38,901 --> 02:12:39,270
they,
you know,

2907
02:12:39,270 --> 02:12:40,700
they were the forces,
right.

2908
02:12:41,270 --> 02:12:45,020
And this picture was so good and so
compelling that people were basically

2909
02:12:45,021 --> 02:12:46,640
like,
we're almost done with physics,

2910
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:47,270
right?

2911
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:50,720
We almost have it all figured out.
And then there were a couple of little

2912
02:12:50,721 --> 02:12:53,720
things like the black body radiation
that you made a prediction.

2913
02:12:53,721 --> 02:12:55,580
It was wildly off.
And so they're like,

2914
02:12:55,581 --> 02:12:56,361
well,
what's going to happen?

2915
02:12:56,361 --> 02:13:00,500
So plonk says,
well maybe when this electromagnetic

2916
02:13:00,501 --> 02:13:03,770
radiation is admitted,
it's not just a continual stream of

2917
02:13:03,771 --> 02:13:06,380
radiation.
Maybe if like individual little packets

2918
02:13:06,381 --> 02:13:09,320
of energy,
he had no reason to say that.

2919
02:13:09,350 --> 02:13:11,800
Like it's just out of the blue is just
pulled out of his butt.

2920
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:13,670
Right.
So he was just sitting there with a pad.

2921
02:13:13,690 --> 02:13:16,400
Yeah,
just contemplate and think what if.

2922
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:18,890
And he goes,
what if he gets exactly the right

2923
02:13:18,891 --> 02:13:19,850
answer?
Right?

2924
02:13:20,210 --> 02:13:20,961
The data.
Right.

2925
02:13:20,961 --> 02:13:22,640
And he said,
there it is.

2926
02:13:22,940 --> 02:13:24,080
And he's like,
he public and he,

2927
02:13:24,081 --> 02:13:26,810
he himself wasn't sure what to make of
this.

2928
02:13:26,811 --> 02:13:28,370
He's like,
I got this idea.

2929
02:13:28,850 --> 02:13:30,020
It gives the right answer.

2930
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:32,100
Who knows?
That is crazy.

2931
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:36,000
And it was five years later,
young man named albert einstein said,

2932
02:13:36,030 --> 02:13:37,200
well,
I know what's going on.

2933
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:39,300
Those little packets of energy or
themselves,

2934
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:41,580
particles,
that light is not a wave.

2935
02:13:41,610 --> 02:13:44,460
There's particles that are being given
off photons,

2936
02:13:44,461 --> 02:13:45,870
would they relate,
are called right?

2937
02:13:46,380 --> 02:13:47,970
And that's what he won the nobel prize
for it.

2938
02:13:47,971 --> 02:13:49,410
I just,
I never won a nobel prize for

2939
02:13:49,411 --> 02:13:51,870
relativity.
He won the nobel prize for inventing

2940
02:13:51,871 --> 02:13:54,630
photons basically.
And then,

2941
02:13:54,631 --> 02:13:56,430
uh,
so there was that.

2942
02:13:56,431 --> 02:13:58,260
So that was,
there were two tracks going on.

2943
02:13:58,440 --> 02:14:00,150
Remember I just said in the 19th
century,

2944
02:14:00,151 --> 02:14:02,610
it was the world's made of particles and
fields.

2945
02:14:02,910 --> 02:14:05,430
So the first thing that happened is
people started thinking about these

2946
02:14:05,431 --> 02:14:06,870
fields,
electromagnetic field.

2947
02:14:06,871 --> 02:14:07,770
And einstein saYs,
well,

2948
02:14:07,771 --> 02:14:09,870
there's something a little bit particle
like about it,

2949
02:14:10,230 --> 02:14:13,590
right?
Is not a hardened from distinction.

2950
02:14:13,980 --> 02:14:17,010
Then separately,
they looked at adam's right?

2951
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:20,190
So you have a electron orbiting and adam
orbiting the nucleus of an atom.

2952
02:14:20,191 --> 02:14:22,560
You have this picture that everyone has
seen the cartoon of an atom,

2953
02:14:22,580 --> 02:14:24,120
right?
with the electron orbiting around.

2954
02:14:25,110 --> 02:14:26,880
Again,
you can make a prediction.

2955
02:14:27,010 --> 02:14:31,260
That electron moving around the nucleus
of anatomies should be giving off light.

2956
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:34,470
It's a moving electron when you,
when you accelerate and electronic gives

2957
02:14:34,471 --> 02:14:37,980
off light,
so it should lose energy and spiral into

2958
02:14:37,981 --> 02:14:40,260
the middle.
It should not just stay in the same

2959
02:14:40,261 --> 02:14:42,350
orbit.
It should be losing energy by radiating

2960
02:14:42,390 --> 02:14:43,650
energy away.
You can.

2961
02:14:43,890 --> 02:14:48,100
You can calculate for a typical adam,
how long should it take before the adam

2962
02:14:48,101 --> 02:14:52,200
shrinks to zero size and the answer is
like a hundred billion to of a second.

2963
02:14:53,490 --> 02:14:57,240
So all the atoms that you and I are made
of should just go right away.

2964
02:14:57,340 --> 02:15:00,020
Rapper that break,
give off light and squint.

2965
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:01,560
Scrunch down to zero size.

2966
02:15:01,950 --> 02:15:03,030
That's a problem,
right?

2967
02:15:03,031 --> 02:15:04,590
That's,
that's not compatible with the data.

2968
02:15:04,591 --> 02:15:09,450
So niels bohr in 1913 ish comes along
and says,

2969
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:12,360
I have an idea.
What if the electrons don't do that?

2970
02:15:12,361 --> 02:15:15,810
Because they can't.
What if there's certain orbits that

2971
02:15:15,811 --> 02:15:18,270
they're allowed to have and they're not
allowed to have any other ones?

2972
02:15:18,450 --> 02:15:21,180
Again,
just pulled out of nowhere for no good

2973
02:15:21,181 --> 02:15:22,800
reason,
but he says,

2974
02:15:22,801 --> 02:15:24,900
if that's true,
I predict the following,

2975
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:27,150
you know,
spectrum of radiation from hydrogen.

2976
02:15:27,151 --> 02:15:27,751
You know,
look it up,

2977
02:15:27,751 --> 02:15:29,370
it's exactly right,
fits the data,

2978
02:15:29,371 --> 02:15:32,310
perfect jesus and people like what the
hell is going on?

2979
02:15:32,730 --> 02:15:35,820
and then it was.
So that took like another 10,

2980
02:15:35,821 --> 02:15:40,080
15 years before people like heisenberg
and schrodinger built that up into

2981
02:15:40,081 --> 02:15:45,081
saying it's not just that waves of light
have a certain particle illness.

2982
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:50,220
It's also that particles like electrons
have a certain waviness and there's a

2983
02:15:50,221 --> 02:15:53,340
wave function and they're getting in
quantum mechanics and we're still

2984
02:15:53,341 --> 02:15:54,420
arguing about it to this day.

2985
02:15:54,930 --> 02:15:58,590
Well,
it's such a difficult concept to wrap

2986
02:15:58,591 --> 02:16:00,480
your head around that.
It's been distorted,

2987
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:02,020
right?
It's like,

2988
02:16:02,090 --> 02:16:04,740
especially in the womb merchants.
I have a,

2989
02:16:04,741 --> 02:16:08,820
a fun part of my book.
I list like 20 titles that came up in

2990
02:16:08,821 --> 02:16:10,350
amazon.
When you type the word quantum in

2991
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:13,350
quantum love,
quantum power,

2992
02:16:13,351 --> 02:16:14,880
quantum yoga,
quantum healing,

2993
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:17,040
quantum politics,
quantum theology,

2994
02:16:17,041 --> 02:16:19,860
you know,
it's used for every crazy bit of

2995
02:16:19,890 --> 02:16:22,980
nonsense that you've ever heard of.
How do you mitigate that?

2996
02:16:23,970 --> 02:16:25,410
Write more books,
have more podcasts,

2997
02:16:25,411 --> 02:16:26,250
keep talking,
right?

2998
02:16:26,251 --> 02:16:28,500
Like you know,
you'll never get rid of it entirely

2999
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:30,250
there.
As you may have heard,

3000
02:16:30,251 --> 02:16:31,930
there are people who still believe the
earth is flat.

3001
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:33,550
Oh,
I haven't heard,

3002
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:37,420
so you're never going to completely get
rid of the wrong ideas,

3003
02:16:37,421 --> 02:16:39,970
but you can get the right ideas out
there more effectively.

3004
02:16:40,580 --> 02:16:44,660
Yeah.
Do you think that it's possible that.

3005
02:16:44,690 --> 02:16:49,220
I mean this concept was created and
invented somewhere around the 19

3006
02:16:49,221 --> 02:16:51,980
hundreds.
Is it possible that another theory

3007
02:16:51,981 --> 02:16:56,981
that's just as revolutionary is being
developed right now and through things

3008
02:16:57,741 --> 02:17:02,741
like the large hadron collider and
search for understanding the elementary

3009
02:17:03,531 --> 02:17:07,880
particles of the universe,
is it possible that we could develop a

3010
02:17:07,881 --> 02:17:11,210
new theory and are there any that are
being contemplated right now,

3011
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:16,520
so it's absolutely possible that what
einstein and tried his best to do right?

3012
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:18,900
He thought that he could do better than
quantum mechanics and he did not

3013
02:17:18,901 --> 02:17:23,901
succeed.
The big difference is that when real

3014
02:17:25,021 --> 02:17:27,390
quantum mechanics was developed between
1,990,

3015
02:17:27,391 --> 02:17:31,320
27 at every step,
it was because there was some dramatic

3016
02:17:31,321 --> 02:17:36,321
disagreement between the theory and the
data and right now our theories are good

3017
02:17:36,481 --> 02:17:38,460
enough that they fit the data really,
really well.

3018
02:17:38,490 --> 02:17:40,590
So we're trying to make,
I'm,

3019
02:17:40,680 --> 02:17:43,800
I and others are proposIng new ideas to
try to understand,

3020
02:17:43,801 --> 02:17:46,020
you know,
how spacetime emerges in quantum

3021
02:17:46,021 --> 02:17:48,810
mechanics and things like that and you
can try to do better than quantum

3022
02:17:48,811 --> 02:17:52,620
mechanics,
but it's all just on pure principle,

3023
02:17:52,650 --> 02:17:56,370
right on pure,
like coherence and beauty and elegance

3024
02:17:56,371 --> 02:17:59,010
because we have a theory that fits the
data fine.

3025
02:17:59,130 --> 02:18:02,520
And it's so much harder to make progress
when you're trying to do it in your

3026
02:18:02,521 --> 02:18:04,140
brain rather than doing it by data.

3027
02:18:04,450 --> 02:18:07,900
Hmm.
So as for right now,

3028
02:18:08,290 --> 02:18:10,690
there's nothing else being contemplated
that.

3029
02:18:10,770 --> 02:18:11,603
No,
that's pretty unique.

3030
02:18:11,620 --> 02:18:13,330
Is being contemplated.
Nothing promising.

3031
02:18:13,331 --> 02:18:14,380
Nothing.
Nothing,

3032
02:18:14,470 --> 02:18:16,750
nothing emergent.
Like there are people who think they can

3033
02:18:16,751 --> 02:18:18,700
do better.
There is no one who agrees that someone

3034
02:18:18,701 --> 02:18:20,720
else is doing better right now.
Right.

3035
02:18:21,070 --> 02:18:25,630
Are there any standout theories that
people have sort of,

3036
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:30,310
I think replacing quantum mechanics or
even improving quantum mechanics is

3037
02:18:30,370 --> 02:18:33,100
because there's no guidance whatsoever
from experiments.

3038
02:18:33,340 --> 02:18:35,830
Um,
there's not even a sort of leading

3039
02:18:35,831 --> 02:18:36,940
thing.
In fact,

3040
02:18:36,941 --> 02:18:39,220
I don't think it's the right way to go.
I think that given right now,

3041
02:18:39,970 --> 02:18:43,450
given the fact that we have quantum
mechanics and yet don't quite understand

3042
02:18:43,451 --> 02:18:45,520
it,
our job should be to understand what we

3043
02:18:45,521 --> 02:18:46,354
got,

3044
02:18:48,250 --> 02:18:49,083
what,
what,

3045
02:18:49,490 --> 02:18:52,010
what has come out of the large hadron
collider.

3046
02:18:52,070 --> 02:18:57,070
I know that they,
there was some discussion as to whether

3047
02:18:57,441 --> 02:19:01,130
or not they found the higgs boson or
boston.

3048
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:04,610
I say bows on,
but pose on was with a z.

3049
02:19:05,770 --> 02:19:08,660
It's pronounced with [inaudible],
but it's spelled with a dance boo son.

3050
02:19:08,750 --> 02:19:09,470
Oh,
it is.

3051
02:19:09,470 --> 02:19:11,510
It's pronounced [inaudible].
I only read it.

3052
02:19:11,511 --> 02:19:13,820
I never had a physicist a bose on,
on.

3053
02:19:13,821 --> 02:19:14,331
Yep.
Okay.

3054
02:19:14,331 --> 02:19:19,331
So the higgs boson there,
there was some discussion that they had

3055
02:19:19,490 --> 02:19:23,390
absolutely proven its existence,
but then there was also some debate

3056
02:19:23,391 --> 02:19:26,870
about that.
So it's actually a very bittersweet.

3057
02:19:27,350 --> 02:19:28,130
The large hadron

3058
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:30,070
collider.
Bittersweet.

3059
02:19:30,430 --> 02:19:31,041
Well,
yeah.

3060
02:19:31,041 --> 02:19:34,040
Life doesn't promise you a rose garden.
Uh,

3061
02:19:35,090 --> 02:19:38,900
we found the higgs boson fairly quickly
after getting the large hadron collider

3062
02:19:38,901 --> 02:19:41,090
up to speed.
We founded in 2012.

3063
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:43,790
You can read that in my other book,
the particle at the end of the universe.

3064
02:19:44,230 --> 02:19:47,210
Um,
but we didn't find anything else.

3065
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:49,490
So did we find the higgs boson?
Yes,

3066
02:19:49,491 --> 02:19:53,480
it is crystal clear that we found a
particle and that particle is exactly

3067
02:19:53,481 --> 02:19:58,481
what we predicted 40 years before that
the higgs boson would look like it talks

3068
02:19:58,701 --> 02:20:01,610
to the other particles in the same way
it has the right mass and has the same

3069
02:20:01,611 --> 02:20:04,790
lifetime and all those things.
But there is a puzzle.

3070
02:20:04,850 --> 02:20:07,130
So this is what we have.
We don't have blatant disagreement

3071
02:20:07,131 --> 02:20:08,450
between theory and experiment.
Well,

3072
02:20:08,451 --> 02:20:10,010
we have our puzzles,
right?

3073
02:20:10,011 --> 02:20:13,250
Well,
we have our mismatches between our

3074
02:20:13,251 --> 02:20:16,430
informal expectation and what reality is
doing.

3075
02:20:16,430 --> 02:20:18,580
So in one way,
uh,

3076
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:21,680
so there's a number which is the mass of
the higgs bozon.

3077
02:20:22,070 --> 02:20:23,330
We measured it.
Okay.

3078
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:26,060
One hundred and 30 some times the mass
of a proton.

3079
02:20:27,020 --> 02:20:29,880
But there's a guess as to what the mass
should have been if,

3080
02:20:29,881 --> 02:20:33,140
if nature.
We're natural nature is natural,

3081
02:20:33,141 --> 02:20:35,600
but if our notion of nature have worked
out the way it was,

3082
02:20:35,601 --> 02:20:37,430
what should the mass of the higgs bows
on?

3083
02:20:37,431 --> 02:20:39,950
B.
And it's literally a quadrillion times

3084
02:20:39,951 --> 02:20:44,270
bigger than what it actually does.
What's a quadrillion tended to 15.

3085
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:45,530
Oh,
okay.

3086
02:20:45,830 --> 02:20:47,180
Yeah.
That's what I'm not making this up.

3087
02:20:47,420 --> 02:20:49,930
You can google this.
Uh,

3088
02:20:50,270 --> 02:20:53,930
the mass of the higgs boson should be
enormously bigger by sort of what our

3089
02:20:53,931 --> 02:20:57,020
intuitive feelings about quantum
mechanics and quantum field theory say.

3090
02:20:57,230 --> 02:20:59,420
So there's a known problem,
has been known for a long time called

3091
02:20:59,421 --> 02:21:03,590
the hierarchy problem.
And so even before we discovered the

3092
02:21:03,591 --> 02:21:04,880
higgs,
we knew it wasn't that heavy.

3093
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:07,190
We knew as much,
much lighter than what it should be.

3094
02:21:07,191 --> 02:21:10,040
So the hierarchy problem was a known
thing and people said,

3095
02:21:10,070 --> 02:21:11,390
how could it be true?
Well,

3096
02:21:11,391 --> 02:21:13,100
you have to change the theory a little
bit.

3097
02:21:13,101 --> 02:21:16,190
You have to like add some new particles
or predict some new features,

3098
02:21:16,191 --> 02:21:19,190
a physics going on.
And many,

3099
02:21:19,191 --> 02:21:20,750
many people,
myself included,

3100
02:21:20,751 --> 02:21:24,800
we're very optimistic that the large
hadron collider would find evidence for

3101
02:21:24,801 --> 02:21:27,620
what was going on,
would find more particles than just the

3102
02:21:27,621 --> 02:21:31,640
higgs bozon.
It's found nothing else maybe would find

3103
02:21:31,641 --> 02:21:35,750
supersymmetry or extra dimensions or
strings or some new kinds of

3104
02:21:35,751 --> 02:21:38,780
combinations of old particles.
It's found nothing else.

3105
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:41,540
So now we have a puzzle and no answers.
Right.

3106
02:21:41,570 --> 02:21:44,840
And that's,
that's the most frustrating thing

3107
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:47,120
because they're the.
I mean,

3108
02:21:47,150 --> 02:21:49,100
people don't want to say this out loud,
but here we go.

3109
02:21:49,101 --> 02:21:50,330
Since no one's listening to this,
right,

3110
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:53,390
um,
the last time particle physicists were

3111
02:21:53,391 --> 02:21:58,391
surprised by an experimental result from
a particle accelerator was in the 19

3112
02:21:58,581 --> 02:21:59,414
seventies.

3113
02:22:00,350 --> 02:22:03,590
Since then we found new particles,
but they were already predicted and

3114
02:22:03,591 --> 02:22:06,020
expected to be there.
We've never found a particle since the

3115
02:22:06,021 --> 02:22:09,980
seventies that no one had anticipated
finding long before.

3116
02:22:10,190 --> 02:22:14,330
Well,
just the idea of a particle collider as

3117
02:22:14,331 --> 02:22:17,210
a lay person,
as a person just looking on the outside,

3118
02:22:17,211 --> 02:22:21,520
like you got to create crashes.
Yet like that's the only way to find out

3119
02:22:21,530 --> 02:22:25,470
what's going on with the,
the basic building blocks of the

3120
02:22:25,471 --> 02:22:27,300
universe.
You have to rush things and knew each

3121
02:22:27,301 --> 02:22:28,111
other.
I know.

3122
02:22:28,111 --> 02:22:28,711
Yeah.
Well,

3123
02:22:28,711 --> 02:22:32,580
so the secret to that is that really the
world is not made of particles.

3124
02:22:32,581 --> 02:22:34,050
It's really made a fields,
right?

3125
02:22:34,140 --> 02:22:36,720
That's quantum field theories.
The laBel given to this.

3126
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:40,500
So for the electromagnetic field,
for the light coming out of the light

3127
02:22:40,501 --> 02:22:41,880
bulbs,
that makes sense.

3128
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:44,490
We figured out the fields first and I'll
leave down the particles later.

3129
02:22:44,820 --> 02:22:46,860
But it's also true,
as we were just talking about,

3130
02:22:46,861 --> 02:22:49,350
for the particles like electrons,
protons,

3131
02:22:49,351 --> 02:22:50,280
quirks,
neutrinos.

3132
02:22:50,281 --> 02:22:54,090
These are all vibrations and fields.
So what do you should think about when

3133
02:22:54,091 --> 02:22:57,680
you think of colliding particles?
It's not little pea shaped things that

3134
02:22:57,690 --> 02:22:59,070
are bumping into each other and
smushing,

3135
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:01,930
right?
It's really like a little vibration into

3136
02:23:02,010 --> 02:23:06,720
fields that are coming into the same
place and overlapping and all the

3137
02:23:06,721 --> 02:23:11,721
particles that could potentially exist
are fields that are out there in the

3138
02:23:11,851 --> 02:23:14,880
world and usually they're just quietly
sitting there not doing anything.

3139
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:19,320
But when these particles that you made
in the large hadron collider hitting

3140
02:23:19,321 --> 02:23:22,470
each other,
that sets up vibrations in every field

3141
02:23:22,471 --> 02:23:24,870
in the universe,
like very faint little jiggles up and

3142
02:23:24,871 --> 02:23:27,510
down,
and then you look and you see in quantum

3143
02:23:27,511 --> 02:23:30,300
mechanics says there's a probability
will look one way versus another.

3144
02:23:30,330 --> 02:23:33,630
So the way you make it how in the world
you make a higgs boson by colliding

3145
02:23:33,631 --> 02:23:35,700
protons,
even though the higgs boson is over a

3146
02:23:35,701 --> 02:23:37,830
hundred times heavier than a proton,
right?

3147
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:40,680
The answer is really.
You're setting up vibrations and the

3148
02:23:40,681 --> 02:23:43,770
higgs field,
which was always there all along,

3149
02:23:44,250 --> 02:23:46,100
and then you very quickly actually you
can't.

3150
02:23:46,110 --> 02:23:48,750
The higgs,
the higgs boson disappears so quickly.

3151
02:23:48,751 --> 02:23:50,730
You'll never see it.
You see what it decays into,

3152
02:23:50,750 --> 02:23:54,030
you see what it converts into.
The vibrations and the higgs field get

3153
02:23:54,031 --> 02:23:57,030
transferred to vibrations and other
things and that's what we observe in our

3154
02:23:57,031 --> 02:23:58,490
detector.
So if you,

3155
02:23:58,580 --> 02:24:01,230
if you are able to do this sort of
conceptual switched from particles to

3156
02:24:01,231 --> 02:24:05,520
fields than the reason why we need an
accelerator and a collider to make new

3157
02:24:05,521 --> 02:24:07,260
particles begins to make a bit more
sense,

3158
02:24:08,730 --> 02:24:09,760
doesn't it?
Don't you?

3159
02:24:10,290 --> 02:24:11,550
Oh,
I get it now.

3160
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:16,830
There was something that I had read.
I'm trying one more thing.

3161
02:24:16,850 --> 02:24:21,060
like if you're in a room with two pianos
and you play one piano,

3162
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:23,880
the piano will start vibrating along
with it a little bit.

3163
02:24:24,010 --> 02:24:25,830
Ah,
that's an interesting way to look at it.

3164
02:24:25,831 --> 02:24:29,370
That's the one field,
the quarks and gluons and the proton

3165
02:24:29,371 --> 02:24:32,490
start the higgs field vibrating a little
bit and that's what we eventually see.

3166
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:35,410
I'm glad you mentioned glue on's.
Um,

3167
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:37,890
that's one of the things that I had read
about that they did,

3168
02:24:38,490 --> 02:24:43,260
they had either discovered or were able
to observe with the large hadron

3169
02:24:43,261 --> 02:24:47,790
collider was a believer.
It's called quark glue on plasma.

3170
02:24:47,820 --> 02:24:48,660
Right.
You got it right.

3171
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:50,010
Thank you.
Um,

3172
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:54,420
which is an immensely dense thing that
the,

3173
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:58,290
the way they described it was something
like something that was a fraction of

3174
02:24:58,291 --> 02:25:01,320
the size of a sugar cube would weigh as
much as the earth itself.

3175
02:25:01,350 --> 02:25:02,183
Yeah,
that's right.

3176
02:25:02,580 --> 02:25:06,990
So usually what you try to do with
particle accelerators is discovered new

3177
02:25:06,991 --> 02:25:08,070
particles.
Right?

3178
02:25:08,460 --> 02:25:11,670
So to do that,
why haven't you discovered them already?

3179
02:25:11,671 --> 02:25:13,470
Usually it's because they're too heavy.

3180
02:25:13,530 --> 02:25:16,230
It takes energy to make them equals mc
squared.

3181
02:25:16,620 --> 02:25:20,580
If their mass is big and a lot of energy
in as smallest possible region.

3182
02:25:20,610 --> 02:25:23,790
That's how you make new particles.
So to do that,

3183
02:25:23,810 --> 02:25:25,810
you take some particles that are pretty
small,

3184
02:25:25,811 --> 02:25:27,550
like protons and you smash them
together.

3185
02:25:27,551 --> 02:25:30,550
And that's how we discovered the higgs
and we're looking for other things.

3186
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:34,030
But maybe your goal in life is not to
discover new particles,

3187
02:25:34,031 --> 02:25:36,130
but to understand the particles that we
already know about,

3188
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:38,050
right?
In that case,

3189
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:39,820
maybe you want to see what happens when
you get,

3190
02:25:39,821 --> 02:25:43,120
like you say,
a huge number of particles together in

3191
02:25:43,121 --> 02:25:46,120
the same place with a lot of energy and
see how they interact with each other

3192
02:25:46,121 --> 02:25:48,670
and make a plasma.
Plasma is like what's at the center of

3193
02:25:48,671 --> 02:25:49,570
the sun,
right?

3194
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:54,130
But instead of electrons and photons,
we're going to make it a quarks and

3195
02:25:54,131 --> 02:25:54,964
gluons.

3196
02:25:55,120 --> 02:26:00,120
So instead of smashing together protons
approach on has three corks each,

3197
02:26:00,550 --> 02:26:03,490
right?
we smashed together the nucleus of a

3198
02:26:03,491 --> 02:26:06,460
heavy adam like an iron or lead adam,
right?

3199
02:26:06,461 --> 02:26:07,560
Which has,
you know,

3200
02:26:08,350 --> 02:26:10,420
dozens of,
of protons and neutrons in it.

3201
02:26:10,421 --> 02:26:14,710
So we get as many particles as we can
squeeze together in the same place.

3202
02:26:14,711 --> 02:26:18,670
So the energy is a bit more diffuse,
but we get to study how they interact

3203
02:26:18,671 --> 02:26:21,130
with each other because that's what
conditions were like near the big bang.

3204
02:26:21,131 --> 02:26:23,560
Lots of particles going on.
It wasn't just two particles smacking

3205
02:26:23,561 --> 02:26:26,170
into each other.
So we're learning a lot about what

3206
02:26:26,171 --> 02:26:28,510
conditions were like in the very,
very early universe.

3207
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:32,790
What is the mass of this stuff?
This core gluon plasma,

3208
02:26:32,830 --> 02:26:37,830
like there's some insane number that uh,
I remember reading,

3209
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:40,720
yes.
But by neural implant is failing me,

3210
02:26:40,721 --> 02:26:42,400
so it's not remember the number right
now,

3211
02:26:42,401 --> 02:26:43,234
but we could google it.

3212
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:45,400
It's very dense,
gigantic,

3213
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:47,980
massive.
If it's a bit of a cheat,

3214
02:26:47,981 --> 02:26:48,360
right?
Like,

3215
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:49,091
you know,
so I always,

3216
02:26:49,091 --> 02:26:53,680
I get laughed when I give talks on the
higgs boson because uh,

3217
02:26:53,681 --> 02:26:56,140
I mentioned that the hate,
the lifetime of the higgs bozon already

3218
02:26:56,141 --> 02:26:57,730
said it disappears very quickly.
Right.

3219
02:26:58,180 --> 02:27:02,140
So I say it's one zeptosecond,
which is true.

3220
02:27:02,170 --> 02:27:03,660
That's just like,
you know,

3221
02:27:03,740 --> 02:27:05,590
you when I say quadrillion,
you're like,

3222
02:27:05,591 --> 02:27:07,240
what does that number?
And I said 10 and 15,

3223
02:27:07,241 --> 02:27:10,510
but who cares?
What's the point of a zeptosecond really

3224
02:27:10,511 --> 02:27:12,430
short.
So I say it's a zeptosecond,

3225
02:27:12,431 --> 02:27:16,870
which is a really short period of time
and everyone laughs it's 10 to the minus

3226
02:27:16,871 --> 02:27:19,750
21 seconds.
But who cares if I said 10 to the minus

3227
02:27:19,751 --> 02:27:21,330
28,
would that have changed your opinion at

3228
02:27:21,331 --> 02:27:22,510
the expose on,
in any way?

3229
02:27:22,511 --> 02:27:24,250
Like it's a really short period of time,
right?

3230
02:27:24,251 --> 02:27:25,450
Like five quadrillion.

3231
02:27:25,450 --> 02:27:27,300
Is that more than a trillion?
Yeah.

3232
02:27:27,430 --> 02:27:30,280
It doesn't really affect your life in
any meaningful way.

3233
02:27:30,970 --> 02:27:35,970
What is going on right now with,
with science that is particularly

3234
02:27:37,241 --> 02:27:39,100
compelling to you?
Other than things we've already

3235
02:27:39,101 --> 02:27:40,960
discussed?
You know,

3236
02:27:40,961 --> 02:27:44,140
I'm very interested in entropy and
complexity,

3237
02:27:44,141 --> 02:27:46,030
complex systems.
Um,

3238
02:27:46,180 --> 02:27:49,450
there's a wonderful place in New Mexico
in santa fe just called the santa fe

3239
02:27:49,451 --> 02:27:51,820
institute,
which is devoted to the study of complex

3240
02:27:51,821 --> 02:27:54,100
systems.
Physicists are really,

3241
02:27:54,101 --> 02:27:57,790
really good at studying simple systems,
a couple of articles at a time,

3242
02:27:57,850 --> 02:27:59,830
right?
And there's certain techniques they have

3243
02:27:59,860 --> 02:28:01,420
this,
this is why we have theories that

3244
02:28:01,421 --> 02:28:04,450
explain all the data because we're
asking questions about the simplest

3245
02:28:04,451 --> 02:28:09,451
possible things that we can.
Once you have a bacterium or a,

3246
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:15,280
an elephant or an economic system or an
internet,

3247
02:28:15,281 --> 02:28:17,770
these are very,
very complex systems with many moving

3248
02:28:17,771 --> 02:28:19,810
parts,
interact with each other and complicated

3249
02:28:19,811 --> 02:28:20,644
ways.

3250
02:28:20,650 --> 02:28:25,220
And so you can start asking yourself
questions about are there laws that

3251
02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:29,720
govern the behavior of these complex
systems that we wouldn't have noticed if

3252
02:28:29,721 --> 02:28:34,721
we just studied them piece by piece?
And the answer is a little bit yes,

3253
02:28:35,650 --> 02:28:39,740
he to keep advertising my podcast.
But we had Jeffrey West on the podcast.

3254
02:28:39,741 --> 02:28:41,070
Who is hate it.
I,

3255
02:28:41,090 --> 02:28:41,923
yeah,
I shouldn't hate it.

3256
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:44,770
That's the whole reason.
Like I'm not actually telling you the

3257
02:28:44,780 --> 02:28:46,700
truth,
but saw through me there.

3258
02:28:46,701 --> 02:28:50,300
I love advertising my podcast.
I had Jeffrey West who's a brilliant

3259
02:28:50,301 --> 02:28:54,860
physicist who actually started as a
particle physicist and then when we were

3260
02:28:54,861 --> 02:28:56,330
going to have,
you remember,

3261
02:28:56,331 --> 02:28:59,000
we were going to build the
superconducting super collider in the

3262
02:28:59,001 --> 02:29:00,950
United States.
This was going to be our version of the

3263
02:29:00,951 --> 02:29:05,360
lhc large hadron collider.
But the ssc would have been both sooner

3264
02:29:05,361 --> 02:29:07,350
and better.
It would have been higher energy

3265
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:08,990
administration,
correct?

3266
02:29:09,020 --> 02:29:10,070
That's right.
And uh,

3267
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:13,130
well it started during the reagan
administration and then clinton let it

3268
02:29:13,131 --> 02:29:15,950
be killed by congress.
Uh,

3269
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:18,440
so Jeffrey West,
who was a particle physics at the time

3270
02:29:18,441 --> 02:29:20,470
said like,
it's my life's work.

3271
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:23,080
I was hoping for this to come online and
I'm not going to see what,

3272
02:29:23,140 --> 02:29:25,730
what else can I do?
And he,

3273
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:30,760
he found that in biology there are what
is known as scaling laws.

3274
02:29:31,130 --> 02:29:34,310
So if you look at different organisms
like mammals or whatever,

3275
02:29:34,340 --> 02:29:36,650
right,
you can plot different quantities like

3276
02:29:36,651 --> 02:29:40,700
their mass and their metabolism or their
lifespan and things like that.

3277
02:29:41,270 --> 02:29:43,550
And it turns out that they are related
to each other.

3278
02:29:43,551 --> 02:29:44,384
It's not,
you know,

3279
02:29:44,450 --> 02:29:47,750
if you know how heavy a mammal is,
you know how long it's going to live,

3280
02:29:47,810 --> 02:29:50,070
you can figure that out.
Um,

3281
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:52,820
and in fact it's related to the
metabolism also.

3282
02:29:52,821 --> 02:29:55,270
So there's a wonderful.
So basically the bigger you are,

3283
02:29:55,271 --> 02:29:57,440
the longer you live.
also,

3284
02:29:57,441 --> 02:30:01,160
the bigger you are,
the slower your heartbeats and they

3285
02:30:01,161 --> 02:30:05,420
exactly cancel out so that every mammal
lives for about one and a half billion

3286
02:30:05,421 --> 02:30:06,830
heartbeats on.

3287
02:30:07,180 --> 02:30:12,180
I've read that and I relayed that to my
friends that are runners and I was like,

3288
02:30:12,671 --> 02:30:14,980
you gotta think if you're an ultra
marathon runner,

3289
02:30:14,981 --> 02:30:16,450
look,
my friend cameron hanes,

3290
02:30:16,460 --> 02:30:21,460
he runs these 240 mile runs this.
He just did that in death valleY and the

3291
02:30:22,900 --> 02:30:25,060
bad.
What I keep saying that ass,

3292
02:30:25,061 --> 02:30:27,250
but it's like the bed.
Water.

3293
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:29,410
Yeah.
Thirty five mileS.

3294
02:30:29,770 --> 02:30:34,210
These are crazy.
So you gotta think like exertion over

3295
02:30:34,211 --> 02:30:36,070
long periods.
You tell them you're juicing up your

3296
02:30:36,071 --> 02:30:38,110
battery.
You don't get a finite number,

3297
02:30:38,111 --> 02:30:39,760
a fixed number of heartbeats to begin
with,

3298
02:30:39,820 --> 02:30:43,540
but you know what they do do though?
It lowers their resting heart rate,

3299
02:30:43,541 --> 02:30:44,890
which is fascinating.
That's right.

3300
02:30:45,030 --> 02:30:47,190
So all this extreme exercise,
oh,

3301
02:30:47,270 --> 02:30:51,580
you're wasting heartbeats,
but also your heartbeat is probably like

3302
02:30:51,581 --> 02:30:54,460
78.
Whereas there's this 34,

3303
02:30:54,730 --> 02:30:58,240
now they're winning overall it totally
compensates weird,

3304
02:30:58,241 --> 02:31:01,690
right?
It's a weird sort of intuitive thing.

3305
02:31:01,710 --> 02:31:02,070
It's

3306
02:31:02,070 --> 02:31:04,650
100 billion and a half is just an
average.

3307
02:31:04,980 --> 02:31:07,340
But the point is,
so Jeffrey West and his collaborator.

3308
02:31:07,341 --> 02:31:09,820
So why?
Why is it that you know,

3309
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:13,180
you can't make an animal that's twice as
big and lives the same blank.

3310
02:31:13,320 --> 02:31:13,940
Yeah.
What?

3311
02:31:13,940 --> 02:31:15,000
What's,
what's going on?

3312
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:19,050
So they actually came up with a theory
based on the fact that our bodies are

3313
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:23,160
right,
our circulatory system or respiratory

3314
02:31:23,161 --> 02:31:24,330
system,
our nervous system,

3315
02:31:24,331 --> 02:31:25,950
and they all have the same structure
like trees,

3316
02:31:25,951 --> 02:31:28,050
right?
Like fractals and,

3317
02:31:28,260 --> 02:31:31,170
and they were able to show that if,
if our,

3318
02:31:31,171 --> 02:31:36,171
if the resources that our biology uses
travel through these fractal networks in

3319
02:31:37,021 --> 02:31:38,810
a three dimensional space,
right?

3320
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:42,450
The weird three dimensional beings,
then you get these scaling laws,

3321
02:31:42,451 --> 02:31:46,950
you get the this universal behavior and
fits the data and now you know,

3322
02:31:47,010 --> 02:31:51,960
you can extend it to the behavior of
things like cities and corporations and

3323
02:31:51,961 --> 02:31:52,794
stuff like that.

3324
02:31:52,830 --> 02:31:56,640
So when you get people in a city,
they walk faster,

3325
02:31:57,300 --> 02:31:59,550
right?
Like people in little small towns mosey

3326
02:31:59,551 --> 02:32:02,370
down the street and everyone in the big
city walks faster.

3327
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:04,200
And why is that?
Like,

3328
02:32:04,230 --> 02:32:06,780
what's going on?
And there's,

3329
02:32:06,850 --> 02:32:08,730
you,
you would not be surprised to learn that

3330
02:32:08,731 --> 02:32:11,460
there are more patents,
uh,

3331
02:32:11,490 --> 02:32:13,860
that are generated in a big city than
this small town.

3332
02:32:13,861 --> 02:32:17,400
But there are even more patents per
person in a big city.

3333
02:32:17,730 --> 02:32:22,350
Like living in that dense environment
changes the rate of innovation and

3334
02:32:22,351 --> 02:32:25,890
things like that.
So they're studying how we can try to

3335
02:32:25,891 --> 02:32:30,450
extract these,
not quite as precise as particle

3336
02:32:30,451 --> 02:32:32,940
physics,
but still very general robust

3337
02:32:33,480 --> 02:32:37,860
relationships between these large
systems and learn from that,

3338
02:32:38,190 --> 02:32:40,740
how to make things more sustainable,
more creative,

3339
02:32:40,741 --> 02:32:43,530
more innovative,
more livable and things like that.

3340
02:32:43,531 --> 02:32:45,180
So I think all this stuff is very fast.

3341
02:32:45,750 --> 02:32:50,400
They've actually done studies where
they've put cameras up on streets and

3342
02:32:50,401 --> 02:32:54,390
they watch people walk by and the amount
of footsteps they take per minute,

3343
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:59,600
they can accurately depict or they can
accurately predict how many people live

3344
02:33:00,601 --> 02:33:02,250
in that city.
I believe that.

3345
02:33:02,251 --> 02:33:03,630
That's cool.
Yeah.

3346
02:33:03,780 --> 02:33:06,450
Just based on how and also how fast you
talk.

3347
02:33:06,970 --> 02:33:08,110
Yep.
How fast you talk.

3348
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:09,360
Um,
uh,

3349
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:13,630
how fast the line moves in the dmv
office in,

3350
02:33:13,690 --> 02:33:16,470
I think it's dublin.
I'm not exactly sure but,

3351
02:33:16,540 --> 02:33:19,000
but Jeffrey West has this picture of
dublin.

3352
02:33:19,390 --> 02:33:22,480
There's this tourist area.
And so it's both a big city where a lot

3353
02:33:22,481 --> 02:33:24,940
of people live,
but it's also a famous tourist

3354
02:33:24,941 --> 02:33:27,190
destination.
We're foreigners come in and wander

3355
02:33:27,191 --> 02:33:28,024
around.
Right.

3356
02:33:28,120 --> 02:33:31,330
And the locals who live in a big city
and want to get where they want to go

3357
02:33:31,331 --> 02:33:34,270
became so frustrated with all these
moseying tourists.

3358
02:33:34,450 --> 02:33:38,010
They literally made walking lanes for
the locals where you have to walk

3359
02:33:38,020 --> 02:33:38,831
faxed.
Right.

3360
02:33:38,831 --> 02:33:41,590
You're not allowed to meander.
Oh wow.

3361
02:33:41,710 --> 02:33:43,570
That is interesting.
That's interesting.

3362
02:33:43,910 --> 02:33:46,540
Listen,
thank you very much for doing this.

3363
02:33:46,930 --> 02:33:49,990
Thank you for being you.
Thank you for this podcast.

3364
02:33:49,991 --> 02:33:53,590
You're putting out the books you write.
It's so important for people like me to

3365
02:33:53,591 --> 02:33:56,320
have someone like you that can sort of
eliminate a lot of these things.

3366
02:33:56,321 --> 02:33:56,780
And,
uh,

3367
02:33:56,780 --> 02:33:58,030
I really,
really appreciate your time.

3368
02:33:58,330 --> 02:34:00,010
My pleasure.
Thanks for being a role model.

3369
02:34:00,011 --> 02:34:04,120
Help inspiring me here.
My pleasure and mindscape podcast.

3370
02:34:04,210 --> 02:34:05,920
That's right.
It's available now.

3371
02:34:05,921 --> 02:34:07,400
Everywhere,
everywhere for her.

3372
02:34:07,480 --> 02:34:08,260
Hopefully.
Yeah.

3373
02:34:08,260 --> 02:34:09,250
Dried.
Beautiful.

3374
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:10,420
Thank you.
Sean carroll.

3375
02:34:10,421 --> 02:34:11,020
Ladies and gentlemen.
