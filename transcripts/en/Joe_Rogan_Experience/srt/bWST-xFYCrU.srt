1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:02,620
Another two.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,130
I remember Chuck Norris versus Bruce Lee.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:05,671
Yeah,

4
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:05,881
that's,

5
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:06,880
watch that real quick.

6
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,140
That's,

7
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,010
that's sensational.

8
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:08,201
That's,

9
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:08,370
yeah.

10
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,540
See if he can find Chuck
Norris versus Bruce Lee.

11
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,090
I came on Hbo and my head almost blew up.

12
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,610
I made my mother get me HB all on the
groove tube came up because the chicks ran

13
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:18,810
through the jungles with dit.

14
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,190
Group tube is cousins
with Kentucky Fried Movie.

15
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,533
What is it?

16
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,980
I never even heard of it.

17
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:26,850
You can take a five minute.

18
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,180
No,

19
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,780
the groove,

20
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,330
that groove tube is saved to Bruv tube.

21
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:31,320
It's Saturday night live.

22
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:32,540
Before Sinai lie,

23
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,300
they made two movies called the Groove
Tube and Kentucky Fried Chicken,

24
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,110
Kentucky Fried Chicken Doc.

25
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:39,570
If I move it.

26
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,260
Oh Shit.

27
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,160
Looking this.

28
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,240
This is the game though.

29
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:43,074
That's the game.

30
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:43,921
God Damn.

31
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:44,280
Look,

32
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,050
Chuck Norris taken off his black belt.

33
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:47,220
Look how young he is.

34
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,530
Bruce Lee.

35
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,730
This is a gay porn.

36
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,230
Look how slowly they on the roving.

37
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:52,380
Well,

38
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,870
this is the game and look at
how we look at Charles North.

39
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,100
Chuck Narcis chest.

40
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,630
Charles Norris get his chest.

41
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,770
It's all hairy and shits before dudes
figured out shaving your chest and when

42
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:03,510
you see this and then
you don't like wrestling,

43
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:08,511
what do you think the big differences
like movie mother fuckers want to see us

44
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,480
play?

45
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,430
This was Brian.

46
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:12,264
This was,

47
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:12,771
look,

48
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:13,920
I'll rip Brian.

49
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:16,050
This was something that
you cannot imagine.

50
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,810
This was every nerd had a hero.

51
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,330
Every immigrant out here,

52
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:20,820
bro.

53
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,230
Everybody had a hero.

54
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,243
They're looking for kitten.

55
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,330
Look at the fucking kitten.

56
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,530
Everybody had.

57
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:26,990
That place has a million cats.

58
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:28,500
I've had the Roman Colosseum though.

59
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,090
Look what he's warming up.

60
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,740
That both warming up,

61
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:33,510
they're doing caught out
a warm up for the fight.

62
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:34,860
Scenes are looking at each other.

63
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,950
This is the craziest
fucking tremendous shit,

64
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:38,640
man.

65
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,300
America has to put these four movies
on and realize why it stopped.

66
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,800
I'm Bruce Lee changed my life.

67
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:45,120
You only saw one fucking movie.

68
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,590
You got to see all four.

69
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,440
Forget the game of debt
with Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

70
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:50,490
That's a harvest show.

71
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,960
Just watch this one.

72
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,973
Look at this.

73
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,121
That's what he does.

74
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:54,831
When he me out,

75
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,850
I was just one of the fight
starts looking at him dog.

76
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,030
He had like 6% body fat at this time.

77
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,590
This guy wasn't gonna die.

78
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:03,280
Joe Rogan like this.

79
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:03,871
Don't die.

80
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:04,950
Don't fucking insult me.

81
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,851
He didn't die.

82
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:07,200
They killed this poor little kid.

83
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,610
But this is really fascinating.

84
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:13,590
I've never seen a movie that I recall
where two guys warmed up like this before

85
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,250
a fight.

86
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,083
But that's,

87
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,030
but this is fascinating how they
just don't even look at each other.

88
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,961
They move away.

89
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:21,720
They go in their own little fucking
world for awhile and they meet in the

90
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:22,020
center.

91
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,853
Like these are,

92
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,620
this is a different thing
than a fight in a movie.

93
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,663
You know,

94
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,820
like this is two guys agreeing.

95
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,520
We have to find out who's the
baddest mother fucker alive.

96
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,600
You know,

97
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,950
they agree to do it the right way.

98
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,850
Everybody warms up.

99
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:37,110
Bruce Lee catches a good sweat.

100
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:37,944
So it was chuck,

101
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,800
this is crazy shit man.

102
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,690
I forgot how crazy this is.

103
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,110
Uh,

104
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,550
this is the beginning guys.

105
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,330
Well,

106
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,360
Joe and I am talked
about the movies of 1973.

107
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,430
You really want to watch the shit today.

108
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:50,910
Go ahead.

109
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,320
But this is where it starts.

110
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,650
This is where all these movies are
stolen from him and they can't even steal

111
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:55,980
them.

112
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,540
They don't know why they even did this.

113
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:57,800
Okay.

114
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,170
Bruce Lee,

115
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,590
he's getting into his fighting stance.

116
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,970
You're the cat.

117
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,803
Bam.

118
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,673
Bam.

119
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,080
Okay.

120
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,410
The bolts were on front leg roundhouse
kicks to open up with in front lake

121
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:08,280
sidekicks.

122
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,783
Okay.

123
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,050
No one's hit anybody
that blocking everything.

124
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:13,831
Oh,

125
00:03:13,831 --> 00:03:18,570
Chuck Norris scores or the wheel
kick to the face and smiles.

126
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,450
It doesn't even follow up.

127
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:20,651
He said,

128
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:21,484
gentlemen,

129
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,070
okay.

130
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,940
No ground and pound.

131
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,073
Right.

132
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,251
Oh Shit.

133
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:27,440
Chuck is putting a beating on him.

134
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,730
Oh my goodness.

135
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,151
Oh,

136
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:31,250
Bruce Lee grabbed the god damn chest hair.

137
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,050
It's not fair.

138
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,541
It's rude.

139
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:37,030
Is this is also the beginning of tank
pseudo when chuck Norris split from Chi

140
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,360
Taekwondo and he could
recreated this shit.

141
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,080
Really?

142
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,351
Yeah.

143
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:40,490
He's a tank pseudo guy.

144
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:40,791
Yeah,

145
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:41,180
but he,

146
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,520
I don't think he created it
while supposedly he had his,

147
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:43,970
his style.

148
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,080
I mean it was definitely a style,

149
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:46,130
but it existed before,

150
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:47,930
so they did two different tanks who dose,

151
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:48,201
right.

152
00:03:48,201 --> 00:03:49,970
This tank Sudo Su bog doll,

153
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,770
and I think he went the other way.

154
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,570
There's a superbug Dole that they all,

155
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:54,740
they all started together,

156
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:55,760
but he went the other way.

157
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,160
Thanks.

158
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,740
You don't have a little
bit of grappling in it.

159
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,160
Yes.

160
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,210
They had more grappling.

161
00:03:59,230 --> 00:03:59,691
It didn't talk.

162
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:00,261
When doe did,

163
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:01,100
they had like some risks,

164
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:02,690
locks and joint locks and stuff.

165
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,201
Here we go.

166
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,310
So he gets his timing.

167
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,460
He starts talking,

168
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,740
jumping up and down and it's all
fucking lights out motherfucker.

169
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,620
But the beauty of this is this
is going to remind you something,

170
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:12,861
Joe,

171
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:14,900
just keep watching watching.

172
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,670
Oh Shit.

173
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,000
Isn't it dishonorable to grab some of
these chest hair and Rick had off them

174
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:20,330
though.

175
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,060
When you were in the Colosseum,

176
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,760
whatever happens happens in this family.

177
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,500
You're trying to,

178
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,251
as long as you don't lie,

179
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:26,180
but watch all these,

180
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:28,040
watch all this is still slow mall.

181
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,001
Nobody knows.

182
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,080
Nothing pulled up.

183
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:32,540
How fake is this row of
they're finding and look,

184
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,220
I'll thinking that brick
wall was behind them.

185
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,030
They keep showing like a picture of
the Coliseum and then a brick wall.

186
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,880
Okay.

187
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,960
This is crazy shit.

188
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,050
Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee,

189
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,260
they slow everything down.

190
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,730
This is hilarious.

191
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,610
The sound that it makes every time
they throw kicks this hilarious too.

192
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,170
It's 40 years ago.

193
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:14,130
Look at the camera work.

194
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:15,320
The guys trying Matt.

195
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:15,590
Yeah,

196
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,820
he,

197
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,111
he's like,

198
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:17,220
kick the fucking camera.

199
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:18,030
He's trying.

200
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,490
He his up poster of the Roman
Colosseum behind poster.

201
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,090
It probably shot this in Laurel Canyon.

202
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,883
Laurel Canyon.

203
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,040
Yeah.

204
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,500
Chuck Norris is watch his feet.

205
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,670
He kicks him in the face.

206
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,241
Oh,

207
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:31,074
chuck.

208
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,430
Oh,

209
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,160
hands down.

210
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,840
Damn.

211
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,450
Damn.

212
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,283
What?

213
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:36,980
Wow.

214
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,430
To chuck to shut it off.

215
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:40,730
Okay.

216
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,720
Beautiful Hair back then.

217
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,283
Hi.

218
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:45,741
Oh,

219
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:46,880
the oblique kick.

220
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:47,390
Look at them.

221
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,390
John Jones style son Bruce Lee was the
first oh front leg round cake to the

222
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:54,134
face.

223
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,240
Chuck Norris goes down.

224
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,910
Had ever seen anything like this before.

225
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,361
Back then,

226
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,410
this didn't exist.

227
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,940
Never saw a fight and moved 11
and Tonya head almost blew up.

228
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,481
You left.

229
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:08,670
They're looking for somebody
to say something to you,

230
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,860
was fucked him up.

231
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:10,840
Including your dad.

232
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,130
You didn't give a fuck when
you left these movie theaters.

233
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,283
This Joe Rogan.

234
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,780
You know whether or not
Bruce Lee ever competed in.

235
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,720
I mean that was like,

236
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:24,140
the big thing about him is that he never
fought like Chuck Norris was like world

237
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:26,270
middleweight kickboxing
champion at one point in time.

238
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,600
Bruce Lee definitely did
a lot of spa for sure.

239
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:30,800
There's no way it could be this good.

240
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,670
The way his timing in his,

241
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:33,504
his movement,

242
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,880
his understanding of what would and
wouldn't work like these in a lot of ways,

243
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,650
even though some of it is ridiculous,

244
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,850
some of his movements are more realistic
than shit you see in the movies today.

245
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,160
The way he checks with
that old bleak kick,

246
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,900
the weight counters when you're moving in,

247
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,040
it's very realistic.

248
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,060
Like these scenes like the ways fucking
this dude up is a lot like the way

249
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,910
someone who is at a really high
levels fucking somebody up in the UFC.

250
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,980
It's really a kind of ironic like the
way he's the shit that nobody does.

251
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:02,180
This no bow.

252
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,740
That's a move and a half.

253
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:07,280
I told you in the 70s
everybody swept Joe Rogan.

254
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,510
Everybody you had,

255
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,600
you had a watch that front
leg you will getting swept.

256
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,870
Once you got into range and you'd throw
two punches laid out that you were

257
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:15,770
getting swept dog,

258
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,120
everybody sweat.

259
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,040
The sweep has disappeared
from our society.

260
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,041
He broke his thought.

261
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:23,874
Oh,

262
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,020
there you go with a fuck.

263
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:27,950
You think you're dealing with.

264
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,240
I was going to be your arm or his leg.

265
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,701
That's how my hand,

266
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,810
when I was out of the eight balls,

267
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:33,644
that's how I

268
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,390
check doors.

269
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,711
He did.

270
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:37,940
He broke his arm and his legs.

271
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:39,120
Legs fucked up too.

272
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:39,954
He fucked them up.

273
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,651
But listen,

274
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:43,370
watch.

275
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,600
This is a tremendous movie.

276
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,010
This is tremendous.

277
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:46,844
Guys.

278
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,170
Next time you see Chuck Norris,

279
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,820
don't looking dumb with the wig.

280
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,080
Think about this.

281
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,370
Think about this move.

282
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,261
Look dog.

283
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:55,094
He gets up.

284
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,240
Even though if it's a movie.

285
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,380
Bruce was very smart.

286
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:57,621
He goes,

287
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:00,620
let this fucking guy up
was a great scene though.

288
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,220
It can't stand,

289
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,353
but he gets up.

290
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,570
This was a good fucking scene.

291
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,290
He gets up.

292
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,610
This is tremendous guys.

293
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,850
Look at him.

294
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,683
Look at him.

295
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,950
He's trying to throw kicks.

296
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,113
Can't get up.

297
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,320
Yeah.

298
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,090
I forget how it ends.

299
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:21,923
It he kill him.

300
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,013
Spoil alert.

301
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,973
Beautiful.

302
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,140
It's a beautiful day.

303
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,320
Even got up correctly with
a fucking damaged leg.

304
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,521
Oh yeah.

305
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:39,360
Mother fuckers.

306
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:41,280
This is cinematography one o one.

307
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,340
You gotta make good teen.

308
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,310
Oh my God.

309
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:47,911
He killed them.

310
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:48,580
Logins him.

311
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,413
First time ever.

312
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,580
He's upset that he had to kill him.

313
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,700
Doug might might've the first
gaiety never in a movie.

314
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,481
I believe.

315
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,314
Backing up a second,

316
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,850
I believe that was an RMN gear team,

317
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:01,500
which is particularly
difficult to pull up.

318
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,761
I don't think,

319
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:03,570
uh,

320
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,950
I don't agree with this technique here.

321
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,360
Let me see back it up.

322
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,194
Just so here.

323
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,453
Is that an arm in?

324
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,150
Let's see here.

325
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,500
I can't see his other arm.

326
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,640
I feel like that's a arm and gear team,

327
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,220
which I call bullshit.

328
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,591
No,

329
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,700
it's not armed men is it?

330
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,630
It looks like it is.

331
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,910
It's hard to finish that one,

332
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:24,061
man.

333
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:25,290
You got to get up high on the neck.

334
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:27,541
Oh,

335
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,580
you got to have an unbelievable squeeze.

336
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,331
Let's see.

337
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:30,721
What do you get?

338
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:31,110
Nope.

339
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,820
I don't know.

340
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,940
Tough to tell where his arm was.

341
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,400
It was if Chuck Norris
had the under Hook there,

342
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,293
it's very hard to,

343
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:36,451
well,

344
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,320
why don't turn it off.

345
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:38,101
Watch we does.

346
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:38,700
This is,

347
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,533

348
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,310

349
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,790
Which Steve was a fucking
soldier and he wrote all these,

350
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,090
you know,

351
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,140
he wrote all of these though.

352
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:47,950
Look,

353
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,520

354
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,353

355
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,101
Oh,

356
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:53,150
the music plays.

357
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,750
Dusts off his Kung Fu Jag.

358
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:55,070
Yet,

359
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,431
by the way,

360
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:57,110
how many black guys dressed like that?

361
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,800
I turned 1970s and eighties
had the full outfit.

362
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,470
My mom was gonna send me back to Cuba.

363
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,350
They sent me.

364
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,790
So Maria reappraising didn't
know what was wrong with me.

365
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,930
Here we go guys.

366
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,793

367
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,320

368
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,641

369
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,360

370
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,193
no.

371
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,720
What happened there?

372
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,331
Just a youtube,

373
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:12,690
cause it's not the whole movie.

374
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:14,630
He goes and gets his
G and puts it on back.

375
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,450
I'll be back on top of how his belt
and makes it look nice for him.

376
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,490
Very nice.

377
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,370
Great fucking scene.

378
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,630
That's the guys.

379
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:24,100

380
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,420
