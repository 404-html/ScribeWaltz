1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,320
The joe rogan experience.
The reason why feminism exists,

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,980
the only reason why it exists is because
there's an imbalance.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,920
If there wasn't an imbalanced,
there wouldn't be this need to be

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:13,400
extreme towards that side.
If it was like,

5
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:15,390
no,
if men were like really kind to women

6
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:17,310
and there was no dispute,
then there would be,

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,620
there would be,
it would be ridiculous to have feminism.

8
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:22,590
Nobody would believe in it.
The only reason why it can exist,

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,460
like whether you believe in a lot of the
things that they generalize or not,

10
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,680
and I don't,
I don't believe in the generalizations.

11
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:31,080
I believe there's a lot of good people
out there and I think as soon as you

12
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,810
start lumping men and a general
categories,

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,250
it's just like lumping women or anyone
in the general categories were too broad

14
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:40,010
in a spectrum is always an exception.
Everything,

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,350
but there's too many different variables
when it comes to humans interacting with

16
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:44,640
each other,
especially sexually.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,620
But the only reason why feminism exists
at all is because there's something

18
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:51,420
wrong.
If there was nothing wrong,

19
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:53,790
if there was no women that were getting
shit on,

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,670
if there was no sexual harassment in the
workplace,

21
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,700
if there was no discrimination when it
comes to employment,

22
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,440
if they're the don't know,
none of those things existed.

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,600
You couldn't make the argument.
It just,

24
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:05,790
it's that simple that nobody would buy
it.

25
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,800
The women wouldn't buy,
nobody would join.

26
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:08,910
They'd be like,
what are you talking about?

27
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:11,370
Like every men,
men treat women like they're themselves

28
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,570
living in life,
you know?

29
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,210
But that's not the case.
So when you have,

30
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,970
whether it's the men's rights guys or
the feminist,

31
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:21,240
the reason why these groups exist is
because something's wrong.

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,070
There's not a balance,
you know?

33
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:25,560
And there's always going to be someone
that's out there on the far end of the

34
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:27,630
seesaw trying to tip it one way or the
other,

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,440
but that they exist because something's
going on.

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,110
The men's rights guys exists because
there's something going on.

37
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,600
Because a lot of guys do get fucked over
in divorce.

38
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:37,470
Man,
I've seen it.

39
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,500
I've seen some brutal shit happened to
men in marriages.

40
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:44,100
I've seen some men that were targeted by
women who are just,

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,090
there were financial assassins and they
went after men for their money and got

42
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:50,760
pregnant with these men for their money
and stole money from these man.

43
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:52,560
I've seen it.
I know it happens.

44
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,110
I've seen it without this.
The baby part I've seen,

45
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,170
I've seen people get fucked over.
I've seen it happen many times.

46
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,420
It doesn't mean that the men's rights
guys are right.

47
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,940
When they say stupid shit,
like men get raped more than women,

48
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,580
you know?
Yeah.

49
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,630
You fucking get raped by each other.
He'd dumped.

50
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:09,060
Fuck.
That's such a dumb thing to say.

51
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,680
It's just,
it's so,

52
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:12,660
it's like,
it's such a disingenuous argument.

53
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,100
Are you really worried about being raped
dude,

54
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,160
cause I don't worry about it ever.
How about that took her to prison?

55
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,690
Yeah.
I don't worry about getting raped,

56
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:20,190
man.
That's never comes up.

57
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,320
No,
and I'm around UFC fighters all the

58
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:24,420
time.
I'm around people who actually could

59
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:27,120
rape me and it doesn't really come up.
I just went,

60
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:31,800
a guy says that if a guy was talking
about divorce laws and the idea that you

61
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:34,860
know,
someone can actually target someone and

62
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:37,530
someone can extract money from them by,
you know,

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,370
by basically a conspiracy,
you're conspiring to rip guys.

64
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,960
Often.
That's what a gold digger is.

65
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:45,330
It's a whole profession.
There's songs about it.

66
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,030
I mean,
it's not like a kind of a myth,

67
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:51,390
like a unicorn or something like that.
It's not what Coupa cobre it's a real

68
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:53,550
fucking thing.
It's a category and society,

69
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,060
gold diggers and you know,
that's not good either.

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,710
But then there's the guys who fall for
those traps.

71
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,360
Where's that?
That's natural selection.

72
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,194
You stupid.
Fuck.

73
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,420
How do you,
how do you not look at her and look at

74
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:07,120
you and not know she's after your money.
You're disgusting,

75
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:07,781
right?
What do you think?

76
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,460
It's your personality.
You know,

77
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:12,820
you're walking around with a fucking
$10,000 watch on driving a Ferrari and

78
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:14,620
you wonder why women want you to pay for
their rent.

79
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,970
Okay,
that's what you do.

80
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:18,490
Stupid.
Which I'm on both sides.

81
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,160
Both sides of the fence.
That's how rocket.

82
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,750
But you know,
I'm trying to,

83
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,450
I'm trying to bridge gaps here.
I'm trying to bring people together.

84
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,980
I'm trying to let feminists and men's
rights advocates and everybody know that

85
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:31,930
we're all just humans.
When I see,

86
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:34,630
like I was watching this thing about
atheism plus,

87
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,520
I don't know if you know what a few of
them is in pluses.

88
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,230
She's the people that wanted attach
atheism with core values,

89
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,110
like against sexual harassment,
racial discrimination.

90
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,870
Mike,
and they had this really long verbose

91
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:48,610
speeches.
But my problem with that,

92
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:50,200
when I was watching that,
I was like,

93
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,530
Duh.
Right?

94
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,460
Duh.
That's what it essentially,

95
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:55,450
that's what it is.
Anyways,

96
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:57,300
it gay marriage,
Duh.

97
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,010
What racial discrimination,
Duh.

98
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,830
You know,
w w sexual discrimination,

99
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,450
Duh.
All of its De,

100
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,440
yeah.
It shouldn't be there.

101
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,790
It should,
everyone should just,

102
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,510
we should all know that.
It's like when you start railing on

103
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,250
about it,
you make me want a sexually harass

104
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:16,030
somebody because you're so fucking
annoying and it's so obvious what you're

105
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:19,210
saying.
It's so stupid to keep harping on shit

106
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:22,130
that I say we shouldn't stab babies.
Yes,

107
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:24,280
yes.
Stabbing profound.

108
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,173
Yeah.
Nobody.

109
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,340
If you don't want gay people to get
married,

110
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,950
you're a fucking asshole.
If you don't think that black people

111
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:33,010
should have the same rate of pay as a
white person,

112
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:33,910
you're an asshole.

113
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,980
If you don't think black people should
live in your neighborhood,

114
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,540
you're an asshole.
If you don't.

115
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,110
It's all nonsense.
It's,

116
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:42,610
it's so clear by this day and age that
it's Duh.

117
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,740
So when I see something like atheism
plus in these long drawn out speeches

118
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,450
where they're mentioning all these other
things that we should all already agree

119
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:51,190
on,
like where are we starting from?

120
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,190
And we started from barbarism.
Are We fucking pirates?

121
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,650
Are we,
are we educating fucking horrible

122
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:58,420
criminal people?
Our fee is like,

123
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,170
yeah.
It was like,

124
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,720
stop harping on this shit enough
already.

125
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,550
We should literally make two countries.
We should saw the fucking country in

126
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:10,330
half and put up a giant fence.
And anybody who doesn't want gay

127
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:13,060
marriage,
anybody who doesn't want black people,

128
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,780
anybody who you know hates Asians,
get over there,

129
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,920
stop.
Right?

130
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,480
You need to figure it out on your own.

131
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,130
I tell many people have already figured
it out.

132
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,350
That's to,
I would say like a small island.

133
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:25,300
I looked like an island.
This let it go and do that.

134
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,330
It might even be half the people,
but it's going to be the,

135
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,680
my point is if you're joining atheism
plus Jesus fucking Christ,

136
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,250
aren't you already there?
I mean you really have to repeat that or

137
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:38,470
I mean how much preaching to the choir
has to be done.

138
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,120
They have to Chirp on that same shit
that we all rational people already

139
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:45,430
agreeing.
Saw this pitch.

140
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,420
Rajender Monitor.
We'll take the left.

141
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:53,110
You take the right go right,
and we can all live in each of the spots

142
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,090
we want to,
but let's put,

143
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,160
let's recognize what we have over here.
We have a bunch of black bunch of Jew

144
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:01,640
haters,
but you gay bashers all in one country.

145
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,610
We could give them Louisiana.
Not Louisiana is pretty cool.

146
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,310
We should we give them North Dakota,
give him South Dakota.

147
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,900
Nobody even goes there.
Wasn't even Rhode Island moved to South

148
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,920
Dakota people to like Connecticut.
They'd be so happy so much.

149
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,100
That was the way this is Spotsy give him
some upper Alaska areas.

150
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,350
Will they have camps?
That's what we should do.

151
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,970
Take racist rally.

152
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,410
I can live with polar bears.
You want to know how much you're going

153
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:30,020
to love black people after nine months
of living with polar bears,

154
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,450
I got an idea.
Let's take everybody and put them in a

155
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,570
kid
that's never been done before.

156
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,170
This will glue the idea.
Well,

157
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:41,090
clearly we have too many people that
suck.

158
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:41,410
Okay.
