00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,580
It makes you really like,

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,920
just like the way people are abused in
other places and the way they don't have

4
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:10,850
rights of life.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,661
The value a lot there.

6
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:12,680
If you're abused,

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,041
you know,

8
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:16,460
and you're just taken advantage
of by whatever the government,

9
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:17,600
the local city,

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,800
you're just the situation,

11
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:19,634
your plight in the world.

12
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:20,811
I don't think that,

13
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:20,961
you know,

14
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:21,291
people say,

15
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,490
well there's no value of life.

16
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:23,324
And

17
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:24,950
I understand,

18
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,420
you know,

19
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:26,840
the,

20
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,340
they,

21
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,020
I watched one time a
guy didn't want to spend

22
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,100
40 bucks to keep his kid
alive and let him die.

23
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,080
He said he'd already spent a
hundred and that was enough.

24
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,021
Okay.

25
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:40,700
You're getting into real situations,

26
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:41,031
Joe,

27
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:41,691
like that.

28
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:46,691
You see different ways people look
at it and Christ and so now look,

29
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:49,160
is this every person there?

30
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:49,401
No,

31
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:50,870
but that's situations that happen.

32
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,700
Those are choices they had to make.

33
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,860
Wow.

34
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,521
And so yeah,

35
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:56,510
like absolutely.

36
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:57,860
It makes me appreciate America.

37
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,980
It makes me appreciate our bill of rights
and makes me appreciate our political

38
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:01,311
system.

39
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,144
Makes me appreciate,

40
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:02,661
you know,

41
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:02,930
we've,

42
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,150
we pitch about things here that

43
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,820
the other world would die
to have as a complaint.

44
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,410
You know,

45
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,071
we're upset,

46
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,120
the traffic's bad.

47
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,110
We're upset that,

48
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:14,921
you know,

49
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:18,190
my wife is mad at me that I'd
come home at five 30 and I said,

50
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:20,140
I'll be all right.

51
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,170
No cannibals.

52
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:23,880
Yeah.

53
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,280
Well,

54
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,490
you know,

55
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,810
people are upset about,

56
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,673
you know,

57
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,990
this transgender situation.

58
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:29,470
I mean,

59
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,303
Dude,

60
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,170
who cares?

61
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,280
You get to go home and hug
your kid and you got a whole,

62
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,720
the world's biggest army
dying for your rights,

63
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,640
dying for you.

64
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,330
You have a giant system
that's protecting your life.

65
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,890
You have people dying for you every day.

66
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,100
There's one way to look at it.

67
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,330
Another way to look at it,

68
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,920
people would say is that giant system
is set up by the military industrial

69
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:01,170
complex to steal resources
was another country.

70
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:01,861
Okay.

71
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:03,150
That's why everybody's coming over here,

72
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:03,850
right?

73
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,670
They are.

74
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,580
It's the best.

75
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,731
Yeah.

76
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:06,300
For sure.

77
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,180
This is the best possible
situation in the camera,

78
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:12,240
but it doesn't mean you and I are on
a boat to get to that better live.

79
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:12,721
Well,

80
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:13,950
we know that it can be better.

81
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,251
I mean,

82
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,810
that's what I think what the argument is.

83
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,561
The argument isn't,

84
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:17,730
we should stop complaining.

85
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:17,961
Oh No,

86
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:18,081
no,

87
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:18,240
no.

88
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,640
I'm not saying we know it can get better,

89
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,470
but I'm just saying when you see it right,

90
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,750
it's far better than New Guinea.

91
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,220
It's far better than Somalia.

92
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:28,500
It's far better than a lot of
the places you've traveled to.

93
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:28,901
Yes,

94
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:29,734
absolutely.

95
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,421
When you,

96
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:35,421
when you do travel to these places and
you do go over there and you experience

97
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:36,354
their life,

98
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,540
does it give you this feeling of like,

99
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,920
like almost like helplessness.

100
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:41,700
Like you can't,

101
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,920
you can't do enough to help these people.

102
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,450
The system that they're involved in the
life that they lived in the community

103
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:50,910
and there we sort of entangled in.

104
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:51,931
I can tell you,

105
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:52,201
Hans,

106
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:55,390
I've gone on with my dad and he brought
it 20 full giant Cabella's bags,

107
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:56,450
just worth of gifts for him.

108
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:57,771
You know,

109
00:02:57,771 --> 00:02:59,000
just given stuff at the very,

110
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,650
we,

111
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,261
my dad's name,

112
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:00,491
Larry,

113
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,510
we called it Larry Mart.

114
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,110
We just let them all come in and
just pick everything they want,

115
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,690
you know,

116
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,300
and giving them things to hunt with.

117
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:07,791
No,

118
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,460
just soccer balls,

119
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:10,241
frisbees,

120
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:13,330
close toothbrushes,

121
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,063
anything,

122
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,390
you know,

123
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,270
and these are people that like need it.

124
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,720
And that's what a show like
that covers Gilligan's island,

125
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,913
you know,

126
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,610
although no one fucked ginger or Maryanne,

127
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,750
there's no,

128
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,280
no one fucked at all.

129
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,640
If you want to talk about like one of
the most unrealistic shows of all time,

130
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,790
Gilligan's island had to be
because there was no sex,

131
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,931
there was no Saxon.

132
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:38,540
And yet how old are they?

133
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,620
They're basic human needs are pretty
well met because the professor belt,

134
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,090
these kickass hots,

135
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,040
anal lagoons,

136
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,340
stuffed with fish.

137
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,420
Now he was like,

138
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:47,320
they were in Eden,

139
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:48,071
so they had plenty.

140
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:50,170
It's not like they didn't
have time to hit on ginger,

141
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,460
make her a fucking,

142
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:53,290
make her a necklace out of some coral.

143
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,410
And they were always trying to
leave and go back to civilization.

144
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:59,830
And all the people in civilization
would watch that show go,

145
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,131
dude,

146
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:01,030
you're in paradise.

147
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,620
This girl can't do any better than
you cause there's no one else.

148
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:05,140
Right.

149
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,780
You're trapped with like the
hottest woman on the world.

150
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,820
The movie star,

151
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,580
the professor and Marianne.

152
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,230
Hey Ron gala

153
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,740
and the private professor wasn't a bad
looking dude with a handsome bastards

154
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,700
smart shop at either one of those checks.

155
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,900
She wasn't.

156
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,120
She was an animal.

157
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,070
Good Lord God,

158
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,933
look how fat.

159
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,783
Hot Shit.

160
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,280
She's skimpy outfits too,

161
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:31,750
didn't she?

162
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,740
Of course she did.

163
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,850
I love how sh they pretended she
had like Cheetah skin outfits on.

164
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,241
Yeah.

165
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,550
Where are you killing the Cheetah?

166
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,780
Did you skin that Cheetah?

167
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,770
Like how the fuck did you make
the they really Marianne now too,

168
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:45,580
but they kept right.

169
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,780
She good body.

170
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,531
Fuck.

171
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:48,640
I thought Marion was hot.

172
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,503
Er.

173
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:49,961
I agree.

174
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:50,800
She's more of my tech.

175
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,491
Yeah,

176
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,030
I mean the,

177
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,110
the ginger.

178
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:54,760
She just seemed like she
needed a lot of work.

179
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,290
Look how hot Marianne is to see
that Maryann was not the hot one.

180
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,610
What the fuck man?

181
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,540
Really?

182
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,880
How's that Pos Marianne
is hot as fuck dude.

183
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,151
Yeah,

184
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:04,984
she is injured.

185
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,980
Just slightly different.

186
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,870
Just ginger's trying too hard,

187
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,120
right?

188
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,850
Marianne's got a straw hat on Marianne
is she's the girl in the bar and given

189
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,910
out hand jobs.

190
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,651
No,

191
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:14,981
no,

192
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,161
no.

193
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,180
You're married your bro.

194
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:17,014
What the fuck?

195
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,870
Now you married Mrs Howl.

196
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,710
You gotta bring her a lot of jewelry,

197
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:26,544
but you merrier.

198
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,200
Okay.

199
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,730
Oh,

200
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,460
look at them.

201
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,060
Look at Maryanne's body in that.

202
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,523
Holy Shit.

203
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,620
She had that seventies body
to a little wider in the hips.

204
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,630
Little thick at the top of the leg,

205
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,890
but the flat ass Peli with
the recess belly button.

206
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,700
Oh my God.

207
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,660
Any shots of the feet?

208
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,553
Gulak yet?

209
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,970
That old school foot fetish.

210
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:50,771
Oh,

211
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:52,700
they weren't high heeled
shoes on a rowboat.

212
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,520
I hope they made the money.

213
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,570
So does he find out?

214
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,610
Did it make sure they did not?

215
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,653
They did not.

216
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,920
That was a long time ago.

217
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,040
Probably sign pictures
at conventions and shit.

218
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,113
Wow.

219
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,440
Because none of them worked again.

220
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,083
Poor girl.

221
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,640
I don't remember ever seeing
any of them in anything else.

222
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,803
No.

223
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,890
I'm Gilligan.

224
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,900
He would do like these.

225
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,150
I would loved both shins.

226
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,010
They would do these fan experiences.

227
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,440
They'd paid to take photos with
them and had a fan of that.

228
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,401
I don't know if he did that,

229
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:25,310
but a lot of like lot of
stars one up doing that.

230
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,930
They do autograph signings.

231
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,320
They get,

232
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,650
what's the range of conversations
you have at that here you'd be,

233
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,790
you'd be Gilligan.

234
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,140
That'd be a fan that's coming up.

235
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:36,620
People in the line and then like
every conversation is rushed,

236
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,040
right?

237
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,540
Because there's a bunch
of people behind you.

238
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,290
Yeah.

239
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:39,441

00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:41,301
Thank you.

243
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,134
Move along please.

244
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,753
Was there,

245
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,650
did you guys really go
to an island for that?

246
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,070
Um,

247
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,090
I'm sorry sir.

248
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,110
If you want to,

249
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:48,530
uh,

250
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,120
answer questions across more.

251
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,470
And what about afterwards?

252
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,071
Ginger,

253
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:52,550
Maryann,

254
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,540
hire just one more thing.

255
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
You can't say that.

256
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,983
Why not?

257
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,220
Because we're at a signing.

258
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,930
He just broke my Maryanne.

259
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,830
Maryanne.

260
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,663
Thank you.

261
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,600
Here's $20 for the bad conversation.

262
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,240
What was the story that you
told on Dom Herrera's podcast?

263
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:09,760
Oh,

264
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,441
Joe Walsh.

265
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:11,274
Bill Walsh.

266
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,170
Unbelievable story.

267
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,930
Joe Walsh is first of all,

268
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,540
an absolute king.

269
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,050
Like,

270
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,651
let me tell you,

271
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:22,170
he's one of the nicest
guys I've ever opened for.

272
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,150
Uh,

273
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,750
he's like so cool.

274
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:25,890
You think it'd be Joe Walsh?

275
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:26,071
Like,

276
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:26,251
Hey,

277
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:27,270
I'm in the eagles.

278
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:28,140
Who the fuck are those?

279
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:28,460
He,

280
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,400
it wasn't like that at all,

281
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:30,510
but we were eating a,

282
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,890
a deli tray and he comes into
the dressing room and he says,

283
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:35,724
hey,

284
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,170
don't eat that shit.

285
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,071
And we were like,

286
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:38,490
what?

287
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:38,791
Why?

288
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,091
And he goes,

289
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:39,361
ah,

290
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:39,780
you,

291
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,970
you don't know what's in there man.

292
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:42,440
You know,

293
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,920
it's just a Shitty Deli tray.

294
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,754
Don't eat it.

295
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:45,301
He's all,

296
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:46,560
I got sick before.

297
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:47,070
And I was like,

298
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,281
oh,

299
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:47,651
really?

300
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:47,941
And he goes,

301
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:48,121
yeah,

302
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:48,760
let me tell you.

303
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,140
He goes,

304
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,500
after he was out of the eagles,

305
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,000
he had a real low spot where he is
partying hard and canceling gigs all the

306
00:07:57,001 --> 00:07:57,630
time.

307
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,560
So he cleaned up and uh,

308
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,440
Amanda said we're booking a tour,

309
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,540
but if you cancel one show,

310
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,010
all the shows will be gone.

311
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,750
So the first night of the tour,

312
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,350
he's backstage eaten on the
Deli tray after sound check.

313
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,090
And about a couple of hours later he gets
mad food poisoning and he starts just

314
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:18,090
shitting and shitting.

315
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:18,601
And he's like,

316
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:19,680
what am I going to cancel?

317
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:20,341
And the manager goes,

318
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:21,780
you cancel this Gig.

319
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,100
The entire tourist gone.

320
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,310
So they go to Kmart or whenever was open
and they get the rubber fishing waders.

321
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,520
He puts him on the ones
that go up to your tits.

322
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:33,030
They were like,

323
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,140
we river runs through it,

324
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:34,980
fly fishing.

325
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,510
He gets on stage and
just start going at it.

326
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,650
Why are you shitting?

327
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:41,700
Like every couple,

328
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,810
like every few minutes.

329
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,520
Oh yes.

330
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,390
You know,

331
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,270
and he's shitting into rubber when?

332
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,100
When does,

333
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,440
then he said mid show.

334
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:56,790
He didn't expect this,

335
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,160
but the heat from the
lamp started burning the,

336
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:03,840
the diarrhea acid on his legs.

337
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:08,280
And as I looked at Joe Walsh,

338
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,430
we're wearing those cause he
wore weird shit all the time.

339
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,960
It was a wacky show.

340
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Denied shitting himself with
weirs on first for him though.

341
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,090
First Minute I met him.

342
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,520
