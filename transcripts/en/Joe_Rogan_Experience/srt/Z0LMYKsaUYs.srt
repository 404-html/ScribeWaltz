1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,780
I got to high four,
three,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,400
two,
one.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,640
Mr Henneghan,
you were talking in the background.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,660
Yeah.
Brian Hennigan is.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,820
He's worried about the link he's waiting
for.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,650
Oh,
Joe Rogan.live.

7
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:14,640
Yeah.
I should tweet it right.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,020
I didn't.
That tweet tweet.

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,330
Tweet it while I'm talking to you.
Douglas.

10
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:22,700
Dan.
Hope the mayor of Fizz B.

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:22,700
Wow.

12
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,240
You're becoming the mayor of La.
That should be your thing,

13
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:31,241
man.
Three hundred square miles of studio 

14
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:32,690
space.
A twitter.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,500
I knew when I pulled up.
What will you.

16
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,860
What the Uber dropped us at the wrong 
place,

17
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:41,861
but then we walked a few buildings down 
and I saw a pickup truck loading epsom 

18
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,580
salt into a side door.
I go,

19
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:46,040
yeah,
that's flotation tank shit right there.

20
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,620
We get the right door.
Yeah,

21
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,170
that's exactly what it is.
Going live with Douglas.

22
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,350
I only did a flotation tank once for a 
shoot at your house for the man show and

23
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,130
you had the one in the house and we were
doing it for a shoot so you can't really

24
00:01:01,131 --> 00:01:06,131
sit back and enjoy it,
but for that 30 seconds they shut the 

25
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:07,020
door until they go,
uh,

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,450
action.
You're like,

27
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,640
wow,
this is fucking weird.

28
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,740
It's fucking weird.
It's weird.

29
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,150
And it never stops being weird.

30
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,430
Like even though I've done it,
I don't know how many times,

31
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,260
every time I do it,
it's fucking weird.

32
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,670
It just,
it's a very strange feeling and you 

33
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,050
could shut it off anytime you want.
That's the best part about it.

34
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,690
Like I love the fact that I could just 
get out of it.

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,720
Like if I,
if you want to do shrooms or something 

36
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:31,720
like that,
that's a commitment.

37
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:31,720
I mean,
you're in,

38
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,530
you're in six,
eight hours.

39
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,800
You don't know where you're going or 
who's going to call or stop by.

40
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,760
Yeah.
You can't,

41
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,970
that you,
you're not shaking that you're just not 

42
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:42,970
going to get you.
I tweeted it.

43
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,820
Got It.
All right.

44
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,110
Beautiful.
Um,

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,450
yeah,
but the tank you just get out.

46
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,100
It's awesome.
Just open the door.

47
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:54,101
It's over.
I'm sure there's some kind of upkeep 

48
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:58,840
that's necessary that I wouldn't do and 
I'd forget and I'd go on the road and I 

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,110
come back and there's bushes growing in 
there.

50
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,110
And you know what you should do.
You should start a tank center in 

51
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,140
Brisbane.
If nobody has money in business,

52
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,670
you don't,
it doesn't have to cost a lot of money.

53
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,830
You get like one or two tanks and you 
just rent them out all day long.

54
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,410
Yeah,
it's a,

55
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,420
again,
it's like people have a disability is 

56
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,490
the biggest form of income there.
I bet insurance will pay for it.

57
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,830
Maybe I made that up.
You should probably check.

58
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,000
Um,
I think that they'll.

59
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,550
Well,
I think it's a form of therapy for sure.

60
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,950
The point is I'm not good at upkeep.
I know you don't have to have above 

61
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,261
ground pool that is just nothing but 
algae for eight months out of the year.

62
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,260
Dude,
I moved into a house once in Encino and 

63
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,141
uh,
nobody had lived in it for I guess like 

64
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:52,420
over a year.
And they didn't do anything with the 

65
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,251
pool and the pool would become this 
green pond and there was schools of 

66
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:57,260
mosquito larva swimming around in the 
pool.

67
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,800
Like I was like,
why in the fuck that?

68
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,950
Like you could see them.
It was the weirdest thing,

69
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:05,440
man.
That's a problem with getting rid of the

70
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,450
fucking thing.
Dude.

71
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,170
It was a real problem.
Like I was looking.

72
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:13,171
I was like,
you've got like a big stew of life out 

73
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:14,860
here.
There are so many mosquitoes.

74
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,230
Who was crazy?
There were like little schools of fish.

75
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,670
I was like,
this is madness.

76
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,560
All these little things are blood 
sucking.

77
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:25,561
Little Vampires.
They're going to fly around and find 

78
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:25,561
things to bite at.
Where I live,

79
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:29,800
there's no other body of water for 100 
miles other than my above ground.

80
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,750
Crazy.
Those little cons,

81
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,780
you can't kill them off.
They just find a way to just breed and 

82
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,080
like back east,
they're way worse now.

83
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,230
They're way worse than they are here.
It's something about the weather out 

84
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:43,230
here,
I guess that keeps them in check.

85
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,900
The worst by far is Alaska that I've 
experienced.

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,690
Have you ever experienced.
Totally shit man,

87
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,200
you get out of the car and they just 
swarm you like huge,

88
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,100
huge and super aggressive and they only 
live to be like three months old,

89
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,620
so when they're going for it,
they're just fucking going for it.

90
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,920
It's like some Wolf Shit.
It's like survival of the fittest with,

91
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:05,080
but it's the weirdest thing ever.
They're like,

92
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,410
they're a different thing.
Like we have an idea on mosquitoes.

93
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,990
Yeah.
They're annoying to get cheese slab.

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,450
Oh No,
no,

95
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:10,770
no,
no,

96
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:11,080
no,
no,

97
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:11,710
no,
no.

98
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:16,180
This is a swarm is there's hundreds of 
them in your face and your eyes all over

99
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:17,500
your mouth.
Everywhere.

100
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,970
Instantly.
Yeah.

101
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:23,971
We have no CMC.
The pool was cool when we get that 

102
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:24,040
house.
It's above ground,

103
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,070
but it's on a slope,
so there's a deck on one side,

104
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:30,220
so it seems like an above ground pool 
because you're above the pool,

105
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,870
but it's still an above ground pool and 
it's only four feet deep or something,

106
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,420
but once monsoons hit look at that.

107
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,420
Oh my God.
That's mosquitoes in Alaska.

108
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,110
We're looking at what looks like a swarm
of birds.

109
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,870
That's the worst part about naked and 
afraid.

110
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,030
If you ever watched that show is the 
bugs.

111
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,240
Like I could go a month without eating.
I do that anyway.

112
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:55,150
I'm a drunk.
I get my calories from the mixer.

113
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,860
Are you?
Do you have to stay naked?

114
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,280
Like can you make clothes?
I don't know how much they cheat.

115
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,930
Oh No,
they have made clothes.

116
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:04,680
They were clothes.
I don't know how much they have.

117
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,130
The producer says,
okay,

118
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,570
you can make the beaver cloth but you 
can't make a full like Hoodie.

119
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,490
They do it with every one of those 
shows.

120
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,760
They'll call those shows reality shows,
but there's a certain amount of like 

121
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,990
plotted out ideas and you could see them
take place.

122
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,740
You could see like the act you see 
acting in people.

123
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,000
I have a whole chunk in the book that 
I'm here to promote,

124
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,470
but about it's how I.
I'm glued to reality just to find where 

125
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,550
they're lying.
Alright.

126
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,200
That's honestly.
I like the name.

127
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,780
Yeah.
I don't know who came up with it.

128
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,210
That's beautiful.
Fuck yeah.

129
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,120
Dude.
You're an author like a legit author.

130
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,890
How did that happen?
I don't know,

131
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,800
but you like,
you've written too,

132
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:53,890
like legitimate books.
That's pretty fucking interesting,

133
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:58,891
man.
That's a different kind of person to do 

134
00:05:58,891 --> 00:05:58,891
that.
Like that's um,

135
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,850
I've always felt like an extra one on.
One of the things that I love is.

136
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:04,190
You actually wrote this to,
you wrote,

137
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:06,200
wrote this.
There's no guy.

138
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,450
Yeah.
What?

139
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,460
No,
there's nothing wrong with those guys 

140
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:12,460
because that's probably the only way 
you're going to get a job,

141
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:12,460
his book.
Right,

142
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,060
right.
Yeah.

143
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,020
If a guy's not going to write it right?
Yeah.

144
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,340
Get a guy,
get a guy.

145
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,370
Well,
Joey Diaz could sit and tell you all 

146
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:21,370
their salaries.
Yeah.

147
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:21,370
He could tell them.
Right.

148
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:21,830
And if you have a guy,
I'm just,

149
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:25,340
I could never trust anyone to write so 
hard,

150
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,730
so hard.
I've talked to so many authors or 

151
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,911
writers or journalists even that they'll
hand in a piece and then the editor 

152
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:34,600
tweaks and changes it.
And the,

153
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:39,670
uh,
an editor got fired from the Daily News 

154
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,541
for doing that pretty recently because 
the guy had attribution's and his story,

155
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,990
the different studies and shit where,
where,

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,460
where he got the information that was in
the whatever the version.

157
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:54,670
And then he got accused of plagiarism 
when he has the original document that 

158
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,440
he sent to the publisher.
So the editor was the plagiarist.

159
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,470
The editor just decides we don't need to
tell people about that.

160
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:03,830
They made a weird judgment call and they
removed the references,

161
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,140
know interviews,
how often they fuck up what you said.

162
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,880
Like I remember I was the winner of the 
Montreal Comedy Festival.

163
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:16,490
Like there's no winner in 1997.
No one wins.

164
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,470
Yeah.
They don't understand what that means.

165
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:18,880
But it.
Yeah,

166
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,360
if you,
if you read,

167
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,840
which I don't on purpose now you read an
interview.

168
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,220
You did.
I didn't say that.

169
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:30,250
Now you're making me look like a dick.
And other comics are going to see this 

170
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,250
interview.
And I didn't say it like that.

171
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,520
You're like the only guy that ever won a
comedy competition that people don't 

172
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,730
hate,
you know,

173
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,990
because you want San Francisco.

174
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,170
Like everybody that was after that was 
done.

175
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:47,450
Like there was.
It wasn't a big deal and it wasn't a 

176
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,180
hook,
but we were both completely unknown at 

177
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,440
that point.
But still,

178
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,820
you weren't unknown in the comedy world,
but they'll put up the mission itself in

179
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:58,820
the late seventies.
Eighties was a huge deal.

180
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:01,210
That's when Robin Williams and Ellen 
degenerate.

181
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,400
By the time I did it,
it was me and an unknown.

182
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:09,401
Dane Cook Bryant.
I think competitions are fucking weird 

183
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:12,110
when it comes to comedy.
Like that's a change in what it is.

184
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,990
I like the festival idea festivals.
Nice.

185
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,960
We don't have to make it fucking star 
search or whatever.

186
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:19,820
What are,
you know America's got talent.

187
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:20,250
It's,
it's,

188
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,290
it's a show.
That's what the country wants to 

189
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,880
compete.
But here's what it did.

190
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:29,750
Introduce a lot of people,
like when they started doing the standup

191
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:30,830
show the fuck it is.

192
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,920
This comic standing last comic standing 
was the introduction of a lot of people 

193
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,700
got to a lot of good comics.
You know,

194
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:39,560
I mean that's how people found out about
them.

195
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,940
Yeah.
But as long as you know going in that 

196
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:44,940
this is rigged.
Yeah.

197
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,910
When you're dealing with.
I just did a seattle.

198
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:51,911
I played up there while the Seattle 
competition was going on and a girl I 

199
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:54,770
know was in it and I had to know you 
first of all,

200
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:59,771
play to yourself.
The judges are going to be people like 

201
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:01,800
fucking morning show,
hack a sports talk,

202
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,960
Dj,
whoever they can get.

203
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,400
It's not real.
Just do your best if it makes you work.

204
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:11,130
That's why I liked him back in the day 
because it made me work.

205
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:14,430
It made brevity important.
I have seven minutes.

206
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:19,431
Cut out the dead weight in this joke.
Get hit your fucking beats and.

207
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,920
But I knew that it's bullshit,
you know?

208
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,570
Yeah man,
it's,

209
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:29,571
I'm,
I'm sure I won because I was way cooler 

210
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:29,571
than Dane Cook.
And I hung out and drank.

211
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:31,890
Drank with the fucking producers.
And what,

212
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,240
wait a minute.
Why would you say that?

213
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,390
I mean,
wouldn't you just win cause you did a 

214
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:38,390
great job.
Really funny.

215
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:38,980
Human beings aren't.
Oh,

216
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,130
utilizable what?
San Francisco,

217
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,340
aren't they a little bit more open 
minded and intelligent than the rest of 

218
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,340
the country where the people that hired 
the judges,

219
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,730
that producer,
I forget her name,

220
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:51,720
that I hung out with the whole three 
weeks and we'd drink and have fun and it

221
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:54,240
probably helped,
but they appreciated you.

222
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:58,080
Before that I was the judge a year or 
two later when I want to keep being self

223
00:09:58,081 --> 00:09:59,820
deprecating with James Inman.
One,

224
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:04,740
I was a judge Acadians.
It bothers me when James Edmond one.

225
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,550
I was a judge and he's still a good 
comic.

226
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,680
He's a funny guy,
eh?

227
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,970
I see.
It's funny,

228
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,250
but hey look,
my point is last comic standing.

229
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,560
Let a lot of people know Lonzo Bowden,
you know,

230
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,960
I'm half round was the first year he 
lost a Dat Phan,

231
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,390
which I said on twitter is what killed 
him.

232
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,050
He couldn't get over the shame even 20 
years later or 15 is that fans still 

233
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,970
around?
I've looked them up.

234
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,660
Uh,
every here and again.

235
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:44,661
You remember Dat Phan and you search to 
see and those occasionally he'd be 

236
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:48,441
playing a casino.
He was a guy that I felt like there's 

237
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:51,430
some really unbalanced hatred towards.
It was very odd when he won last comic 

238
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:54,690
standing,
people were really mad.

239
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,020
There was a certain percentage of comics
that were really mad and let me tell you

240
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:03,021
something.
I was there when he had a set and he 

241
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:05,811
fucking killed.
He fucking killed whether or not you 

242
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:06,120
like that kind of material or not.

243
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,460
There was like he got up a bunch of 
hatred.

244
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,060
Was wasn't just.
He wasn't a young guy like,

245
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:13,050
wow,
what was it,

246
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:18,051
Craig?
Because Eliza one last comic standing 

247
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:18,051
when she was like three years in.
Right.

248
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:21,780
I think she said that she didn't.
She said that three or four years in.

249
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,960
I hope I don't say the wrong years,
but I mean that's kind of the same thing

250
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:26,010
along the same lines,
right?

251
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,410
Like you're getting in,
but if you do it,

252
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:29,220
you do it.
Sure.

253
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,580
You,
when you've got eight minutes to kill,

254
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,950
you can break it up and for whatever 
reason,

255
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:39,951
man,
people are so pissed at him because he 

256
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:39,951
was kind of fresh to comedy,
right?

257
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:43,461
Like he hadn't been ridiculous.
He was one of those scientists that you 

258
00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:47,541
hate.
He sat down and he grabbed the laughs 

259
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,241
per minute.
He's getting based on his recordings of 

260
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,630
his sets and really did that on last 
comic standing.

261
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,260
He'd have these graphs of laughs.
That's interesting.

262
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,510
Why do I hate that?
I don't know.

263
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:03,511
We were talking about this on a podcast 
yesterday where like the all the people 

264
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:08,611
that you were trained to hate.
We're talking about like carrot top and 

265
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:10,060
the nineties.
You hated carrot top as a comedian.

266
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:15,061
You kinda had to hate him.
And then he beat Bill Hicks for some 

267
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:16,870
comedy award back when they had comedy 
awards.

268
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,270
Uh,
what's also the prop thing,

269
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,270
for whatever reason,
a prop comic is a lesser man,

270
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,260
right?
But he's essentially,

271
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,280
he's the last guy that's going to 
interfere with us.

272
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,940
He no one's flipping a coin between 
carrot top and Joe Rogan.

273
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:31,970
Well,
yeah.

274
00:12:31,971 --> 00:12:36,971
And,
but I think there's enough to go around 

275
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:37,690
even if they were like this shit,
but I'm saying all that hatred.

276
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:42,691
And we were talking about Dennis Leary,
who I listened to on stern and I really 

277
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:47,701
loved the interview and I liked Denis 
leary and I realized it was just all 

278
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:52,471
that he stole Bill Hicks Persona thing,
that I just hated him for that.

279
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,950
And you get old and you go,
I don't really give a shit.

280
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,540
Yeah.
And when do you let it go?

281
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,140
Yeah,
Wendy let it go when we're old and go,

282
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:07,690
fuck yeah.
We were joking around before the show 

283
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,461
about how to send off an email and he's 
probably talking to someone on twitter 

284
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:11,560
or no,
fuck your mother,

285
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,430
like you imagine in that guy is still 
doing that all the time.

286
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:18,760
Like God damn thatall right?
I talked to Owen Benjamin and he's like,

287
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:19,990
dude,
sometimes I don't sleep.

288
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,490
I'm like,
listen to me man.

289
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,620
You've got to stop doing that because 
Owen will fucking go to war on twitter 

290
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,400
all day.
And Jamie Kilstein,

291
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:32,401
Jamie Kilstein was on and he was pretty 
open about how he would be when he was 

292
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:33,400
all social justice,
Warrior it out.

293
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,690
He would get crazy with his phone and 
these arguments where he couldn't think 

294
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,401
of anything,
but he was constantly pulling his phone 

295
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:41,401
out,
checking and what did they say?

296
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:41,401
What they say,
well,

297
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:45,991
fuck them.
You fucking cisgender piece of shit or 

298
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,160
whatever the fuck you get mad with it.
You get obsessed.

299
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,780
I just say,
don't do it folks.

300
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,900
Avoid arguments in real life,
especially when you're arguing down.

301
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,060
You might be,
you know,

302
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,380
you might be like going to war with 
someone who's on your own level.

303
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah,
I'd argue on A.

304
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,650
There's a couple of recent things were 
friends of mine are arguing.

305
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,080
You know that you look like a fucking 
open mic or when you,

306
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,200
when you have these arguments in 
business with people who are far your 

307
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,860
underlings.
Well it's just.

308
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,110
I mean I just really feel like we should
try for meaningful discussion with 

309
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:29,830
friendly people and just figure out what
the fuck we disagree on,

310
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,860
but that's where I get trapped is I'm 
the guy that when the Jehovah's witness 

311
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,211
comes to my door,
you start to find them the mood I'm 

312
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:39,211
going to,
I'm going to prove them wrong.

313
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,660
And the less sense they make,
the harder that fucking wood is to knock

314
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,750
on how you store.
They used to be my thing.

315
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,290
I would always want to argue with people
about.

316
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,950
Especially about like if someone

317
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,290
had had some ridiculous religious 
belief,

318
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,950
I would always argue with them about it.
And now I don't.

319
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,830
I don't care.
Like as long as I'm nice,

320
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,360
I think it's.
I think it helps a lot of people I 

321
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,360
really do and it.
And even if they're not right,

322
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,400
here's the thing,
if you live like it's true,

323
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,990
it is right while you're alive,
if you live like it's true.

324
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:19,991
Like we look at it like almost from two 
dimensions when there's like multiple 

325
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:23,630
dimensions to the idea of religion.
Because even though it probably,

326
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,460
there was never a time where a guy came 
back from the dead.

327
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:27,230
There's probably never a time where a 
guy walked on water.

328
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,470
But if you buy the idea of this person 
and this person's goal for humanity and 

329
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:38,441
move toward the directions,
like moving towards love and compassion 

330
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:39,170
and treating each other as equals.

331
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,880
I mean that's like the whole Jesus 
thing.

332
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,750
So even if it's it never really weird 
superstition,

333
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:47,570
that was the catalyst to make you a 
decent person.

334
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,430
Yeah,
I think like all human things,

335
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:52,070
he gets poisoned along the way.
But the idea behind it,

336
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:56,060
if even if you don't think it's true,
if you treat it like it's true,

337
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,540
it is true.
Like you really will make a better 

338
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:01,540
world.
It sounds like super hippie.

339
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,370
No,
that's twisty shit.

340
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,440
And if you have some mental illness that
makes you believe you're driving a 

341
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,790
cadillac,
you're driving a fucking Cadillac,

342
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,820
but you know how we have laws and we 
have certain ways that we behave and we 

343
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,870
have agreements with how we dress and 
the words we use,

344
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,880
the phrases.
If there was a religion that was all 

345
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,411
super positive that we just all agreed 
to adopt just the same way we adopt all 

346
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:27,650
the other things that we do in our 
lives.

347
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,920
All the other normal shit we do with the
way we decided to dress or cars we 

348
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,580
drive.
Just adopt that in there too.

349
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:36,650
Like this is.
This is just how we behave.

350
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:41,651
We behave as this as if we are souls in 
a vessel created by the great one who 

351
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:47,321
knows everything and has a plan for us 
all and we should be kind to each other 

352
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:47,321
and move in the direction of love and 
harmony.

353
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:49,230
I mean,
that's basically what all religions.

354
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,400
Some Cock sucker that says,
oh yeah,

355
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,540
that a great entity just spoke to me 
directly in my bedroom and we're going 

356
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,541
to have a different sect of religion.
There's a fucking funny show on Netflix 

357
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,110
about that.
The unbreakable,

358
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:07,490
Kimmy Schmidt was a woman who was in a 
sex cult who was in the backyard,

359
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:10,130
like trapped in a basement for like 
months with some.

360
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:10,660
I don't know.

361
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,740
I mean,
I don't know how it's yours.

362
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,570
I think it was supposed to be.
It's a really funny show though,

363
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:15,590
and she gets.
Have you seen it?

364
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,090
Wait,
is it a show?

365
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,400
A show?
It's a sitcom on Netflix.

366
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,080
It's called the unbreakable Kimmy 
Schmidt.

367
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,680
I think Tina fey is one of the people,
the creative people on it.

368
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,640
Fucking funny show man.
Like really funny.

369
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,340
Like so overdue to get caught up on 
Netflix binges.

370
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,610
Oh Man.
Yeah,

371
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,640
it seems like it's been two years of 
just as something I gotta do I need new 

372
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,250
ones?
I need to catch up on old ones.

373
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,920
A plug.
Nathan,

374
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:47,921
for you.
Have you watched Nathan for you on 

375
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:47,921
comedy central?
No.

376
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:51,771
What is it?
Is one of the funniest fucking shows 

377
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:51,771
ever.

378
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:55,520
Completely underrated.
You have to understand what it is going 

379
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,350
in.
It's basically like a bar rescue,

380
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:02,730
but a fake a.
it's basically a hidden camera show,

381
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:08,030
but open hidden camera.
It's like a bar rescue kitchen 

382
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,030
nightmares,
Nathan.

383
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,630
Uh,
what's the God,

384
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,460
goddammit?
Google it.

385
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,560
Nathan something Jewish.
Uh,

386
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,980
Nathan fielder.
Nathan fielder.

387
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,410
And he's A.
Yes,

388
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,090
he does for small business.
He uh,

389
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,800
he helps small businesses.
This guy,

390
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,160
it's,
he's so uncomfortable to watch.

391
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,180
I can't do it justice.
You have to watch Nathan for you.

392
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,360
So these people with small businesses 
think it's a real show and they come on 

393
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:41,370
and he helps them with their problems 
and it's,

394
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,750
it's,
it's so amazingly layered in watch the 

395
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:48,990
one with the,
uh,

396
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:53,991
the guy that has the,
a TV shop that can't compete with best 

397
00:18:53,991 --> 00:18:56,310
buy and there's so many layers.

398
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,170
I put it on my phone,
I trusted implicitly pleased,

399
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,200
watch it and then tweet about it because
it's fucking brilliant and I'll just 

400
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,160
embarrass it by trying to explain it.
If there's anything,

401
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:13,310
any prominent,
how with Netflix is that sometimes I 

402
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:13,310
don't know what I'm looking for.
You know,

403
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,000
like there's a lot of shows that turns 
out like,

404
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:20,001
Whoa,
this is a four seasons of this and you 

405
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:20,001
never heard of it.
Like maybe it's just me.

406
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:23,990
Maybe I'm that.
And it's totally possible because 

407
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:23,990
there's always some fucking new musical 
artists.

408
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,420
And I go,
who the fuck is that?

409
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,240
And I'll go to their instagram page.
They have 14 million followers.

410
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:27,780
And I'm like,
oh,

411
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:29,640
it's me.
I'm that old man.

412
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,280
I'm that old band.
Doesn't know Jack Shit.

413
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:32,530
We

414
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:36,610
had a uber coming here.
Was this old prolly Armenian guy,

415
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:40,930
probably sixties racist.
Triggered a start the show.

416
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,830
He uh,
he's listening to what I assume he 

417
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,740
thinks people want to listen to and it's
all this shit.

418
00:19:47,741 --> 00:19:51,910
I couldn't name you a fucking Jz from a 
that kind of shit.

419
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,730
I don't know any of it.
And I'm about to say,

420
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,860
hey,
you don't have to play this for us.

421
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,270
But then I,
I saw him lip sinking to the lyrics and 

422
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,810
tapping his fingers.
Oh,

423
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,130
on the steering wheel.
I'm like,

424
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:11,131
wow,
how out of the loop of my fucking 60 

425
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:13,510
year old for an uber,
Uber drivers know all the words to these

426
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:15,930
fucking songs.
But you never been a music guy.

427
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,550
No,
you don't like music now that's,

428
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,420
that's something that it's not possible.
I mean,

429
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,920
I have songs I like,
wait,

430
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,160
what's a great song like Doug,
Stan hope here's.

431
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:28,290
He goes,
oh yeah,

432
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,840
sits back.
Most of the new songs that I've,

433
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:35,930
I've learned I've either heard playing 
in a store or on a commercial and I go,

434
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:37,990
ah,
that's catchy.

435
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,800
Do you latch,
chat,

436
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:39,790
chat,
chat,

437
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,280
chat?
I don't know that I love you.

438
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,570
Chop chop chop by a Jimmy.
Yeah,

439
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,590
it's from like 1997 was on the 
soundtrack of the movie go.

440
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,350
And then they disappeared.
You can't even find where the band is 

441
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,321
now,
but it was on a corona commercial and I 

442
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:04,570
love it and I use it as intro music all 
the time.

443
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:06,610
That pumps me up.
There you go.

444
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,590
Sing a song.

445
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,460
Well,
give me some volume.

446
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,540
See,
I'm just seeing the video on

447
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,930
mute.
I'm into this song.

448
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:24,190
This is great.
Headphones.

449
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,410
This is great.
No,

450
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,720
no,
that.

451
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:34,250
I love you always.
Again,

452
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:41,810
I like how these gals are dressed like 
they're 19 fifties.

453
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,060
Cover girls.
What is about that look,

454
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:46,710
right?
That like cover,

455
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,670
you know,
pinup girl.

456
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:49,210
That's what it's called.
Nineteen fifties.

457
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,640
Pinup girl type of.
Look.

458
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,050
What is it about that feeling?
Maybe it makes fat chicks look good.

459
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,840
Doug.
Stan hope.

460
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,350
Do you not realize it was a different 
day and age?

461
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,190
You can't say that anymore.
Those days are done.

462
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,380
What's wrong with a fat girl looking 
good?

463
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:12,410
What's wrong with you?
You just need to just find out what able

464
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:15,650
is to meet Dave Bliss.
Ablest.

465
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,330
I'd read.
I saw someone write a bus.

466
00:22:18,331 --> 00:22:19,400
I'm like,
do I really want to go in?

467
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:21,960
And they say,
it's got to be a handicapable.

468
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,110
Exactly.
You're your person that doesn't get the 

469
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,420
words,
but if you are mocking someone who's 

470
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,600
like literally stupid or low watt 
Gurgler in a high back chair.

471
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,410
Exactly.
You're,

472
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:35,240
you're,
you're enabling,

473
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,620
you call people idiots.
You're enabling.

474
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,310
Yup.

475
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,080
That was my last special.
I did a whole bit about,

476
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:49,030
it's called the euphemism treadmill 
where you can't say retarded because.

477
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:54,150
But retarded was the clinical term 
because before that they were called 

478
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,920
imbeciles and morons or they were called
Mongoloid idiots.

479
00:22:56,921 --> 00:23:01,921
Yeah.
And that's what it was for kids with 

480
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:03,481
downs.
They kept changing it and then we kept 

481
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:06,421
making fun of them with the new name so 
they had to change the new name to 

482
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:09,160
something else and then we'd make fun of
what the new name under the punchline to

483
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:11,770
the entire long bit was,
you know,

484
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:15,040
if you went straight clinical 
definition,

485
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,950
American Medical Association and you 
said,

486
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,680
Oh uh,
and you made that stick.

487
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,780
That's what I'm going to make fun of you
for.

488
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:24,730
When you slip on a banana peel.
Oh,

489
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:29,731
you just exhibited some of the Atlanto 
axial instability usually associated 

490
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:34,501
with the trisomy 21 genetic disorder.
You fucking stage funny by seven was 

491
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,900
bored with the trisomy 21.
Chromosomal imbalance.

492
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,580
Yeah.
There's certain things can make fun of 

493
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:48,580
white people.
White people are failure.

494
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,870
Fair game.
You can be racist as fuck.

495
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,820
Sure.
Especially if you're a white guy.

496
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,980
You hate white people making fun of 
lawyers.

497
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:57,620
They last long with you because they own
everything.

498
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,730
Yeah.
Lawyers are good.

499
00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:00,680
One to make fun of,
but he can't make fun of Jews.

500
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,320
Well,
yeah.

501
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,440
Jew is just one of those words where 
it's all in the inflection as to whether

502
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:09,290
or not he fucking Jew.
Whoa.

503
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,500
Right.
It's all been.

504
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,130
No.
You know,

505
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,950
the Jews are a people that that's fine,
but if you say Joe.

506
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,260
Yeah.
Like you say,

507
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,380
if you say I'm all about Jews,
that's okay.

508
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,200
Yeah.
I'm all about Jews.

509
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,990
Just like hanging out with Jews.
That's a only Jews.

510
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,390
People would go there in the town like 
you'd be okay.

511
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,220
That's all right.
People accept that,

512
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,600
but it feel like,
God,

513
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:33,650
I'm tired of all these Jews.

514
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,440
Unacceptable.
Unacceptable.

515
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:36,900
Y,
W.

516
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,980
I overdosed on Jews.
I was just around nothing but Jews for 

517
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,251
like months and there's too many one in 
Armenian in my life for a few days I 

518
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,430
talked to somebody I never do sets.
If I come to town and I'm hanging at the

519
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:54,431
comedy store,
it's to talk to you and drinking the 

520
00:24:54,431 --> 00:24:54,431
back bar and hang out.
Hey,

521
00:24:54,431 --> 00:24:59,321
do you want to do is set no fucking way.
Do I ever want to do a set for normal 

522
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:00,730
people?
I.

523
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,730
I paid my fucking dues.
I made my bones to have a small niche 

524
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,200
fan base that are defendable.
Doug,

525
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:10,400
I got news for you.
Okay.

526
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:15,401
I hate to do this to you again,
but they're here like your fans are 

527
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:17,420
here.
Your fans or fans or in La,

528
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,160
they would love it if you did a set.
They're like,

529
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:20,780
it's not like they wouldn't go through.

530
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,060
They're like,
you have a lot of fans.

531
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:26,570
You fuckhead doctor with this niche 
group.

532
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:28,100
That's horseshit.
People know you're funny.

533
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:31,400
I'm tired of this.
I'm talking about when it's just a mixed

534
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:34,880
bill of fucking love.
You scatter shot this 400 people.

535
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:37,670
I bet 320 of them are your fans.
First of all,

536
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,850
you know this well.
You still do some shit.

537
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:45,851
I saw you last time I saw you.
You were doing one of those weird shows 

538
00:25:45,851 --> 00:25:49,241
where people just called out premises,
stand up on the spot and you fucking 

539
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:50,420
destroyed it,
and you told me afterwards,

540
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:53,780
none of that was planned.
You had none of that in your holster.

541
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,580
All of that was off the top of your 
head,

542
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:57,680
which is fantastic.
I was high as a kite.

543
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,270
I barely knew what I was saying.
It's for me to do material.

544
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,270
I can't do you.
Fifteen minutes.

545
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,150
One minute.

546
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,440
Give me a mental hugs.
Come into the embrace of the comedy 

547
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,220
store to stop this.
Why is,

548
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,240
why would I do it outside of my own 
comfort zone?

549
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,870
Don't you aren't in your comfort zone.
Your comfort zone is everywhere.

550
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,450
If I went up on stage,
if I came to town,

551
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:28,451
which I rarely do,
I get to see you and a million people I 

552
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:31,370
never see all in one room and everybody 
loves to see you too,

553
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,760
but if I went on stage,
then I would have this whole anxiety,

554
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,120
well,
that sucked,

555
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:40,970
and then I'd be apologizing for my set.
Oh,

556
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:43,590
great.
Set says Greg proops or someone and then

557
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:44,940
you're like,
it wasn't good.

558
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:49,941
I forgot this tag and that tag and I 
rather than just hanging out and 

559
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:50,670
enjoying myself,
so fuck it.

560
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,590
Bucket.
So here's the thing though,

561
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:57,650
and this is,
I'm going to say this with all 

562
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,571
sincerity,
there's more understanding and 

563
00:26:59,571 --> 00:27:03,470
camaraderie at the store right now than 
any place I've ever been at any time.

564
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,560
And even when we have bad sets,
like people have someone have a bad set 

565
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:09,560
and like,
how was it dude?

566
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,820
I could not connect with those people.
Like someone will say,

567
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:15,000
you know,
we'll be fill Arkansas.

568
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:18,460
Then the comedy store,
the front of my peers somewhere.

569
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:23,510
No one will see it.
You talk about it and you learn 

570
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,230
something from it and you.
It's like it's a weird environment,

571
00:27:25,231 --> 00:27:30,231
but it fosters new shit.
It fosters new ideas and taglines and 

572
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,260
which I was going to say about twitter 
battles.

573
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,430
I got so much good material out of 
fighting these,

574
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,670
whatever it was at the time,
my space,

575
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:46,671
twitter,
facebook before that news groups and 

576
00:27:46,671 --> 00:27:47,280
getting into these angry,
ugly arguments.

577
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:51,690
When I'm writing,
I'm writing paragraphs in defense of and

578
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:55,260
guess what?
Oh I have 15 minutes because some stooge

579
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,440
annoyed me on a dot comedy standup news 
group and I spent all night fighting,

580
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,370
accidentally wrote a new act.

581
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,700
That's actually probably a good use of 
it if you could see you and I are very 

582
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,751
different in that regard.
I would rather just not talk to those 

583
00:28:14,751 --> 00:28:14,751
people,
but if you did want to go to war,

584
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:19,910
which I used to do,
you can get some material out of that 

585
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:19,910
for sure.
Because you're forcing yourself to think

586
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,240
again anytime you forced yourself to 
her.

587
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,330
Like I've found that like the best shit 
that I ever write.

588
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,240
I write completely free form where I 
don't know,

589
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,960
I just like,
I'll,

590
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,950
I'll,
I'll just start thinking about,

591
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,260
uh,
any subject and just start writing.

592
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,310
I'm not specifically try to write jokes 
and on,

593
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,110
on the way I can like Kinda suck those 
jokes out of there.

594
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,300
Do you do that?
How do you.

595
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,640
It depends on the,
the,

596
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,770
the premise,
but the best premises I have,

597
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,720
I write like a defense attorney.

598
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,290
So.
And then we can look at it,

599
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:56,300
login the jokes afterwards,
once the justice has left the courtroom,

600
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,060
all rise.
Then you put it in the fist fuck jokes.

601
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,170
Yeah.
There's,

602
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,200
there's a gut.
It's super important to have a balance.

603
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:09,201
Right.
And you got to find out where that 

604
00:29:09,201 --> 00:29:10,431
balance is.
Like when you can get away with a 

605
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:10,431
premise,
you know,

606
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:13,190
you've got to stack it just right.
I could just stack it the wrong way one 

607
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,970
way.
And you look like you're patronizing and

608
00:29:14,971 --> 00:29:17,640
you're full of shit.
Stack at the wrong way the other way you

609
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:22,641
look like,
or a sexist or a Republican and secret 

610
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:22,890
man.
Do I have notes?

611
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,980
The new current current climate?
Yeah,

612
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,090
I'm sure.
Right?

613
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,640
Imagine working for a television show.
I wanted to bring this up.

614
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,590
I'm glad we just got to talking about 
this.

615
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:38,610
Sam Cedar got fired yesterday.
I missed this.

616
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:42,150
So can I just saw someone on twitter 
deal?

617
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:47,250
Sam Cedar,
who's a heavy leftwing fellow who um,

618
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,980
was apparently in some sort of a dispute
with the alt right.

619
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,790
I don't know what was going on.
I think it was about Roy Moore.

620
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,820
Like there's one of those things and 
they pulled up a tweet of his and took 

621
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:04,771
it out of context from 2009 and that 
suite was.

622
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,120
I'm going to paraphrase it,
I don't want to fuck it up.

623
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:07,870
Jane.
Actually Jamie,

624
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:09,370
pull it up so we can find the exact

625
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,400
tweet.
You know that if you paraphrase it,

626
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:13,590
you're going to sound funnier than he 
would.

627
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,800
It wasn't that funny road interact.
If I was going to edit your act,

628
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:24,830
this is how you fight it.
He just actually,

629
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:28,350
here's one minute ago.
Here's essentially what it is.

630
00:30:28,351 --> 00:30:33,351
If you can't find it,
you got to find it and you've got to 

631
00:30:33,351 --> 00:30:33,351
find the.
Because I don't want to fuck this up.

632
00:30:33,351 --> 00:30:36,570
I can't tell you how many times I've 
told Hennigan about now this comment,

633
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:41,571
you get to see this is a great comic.
They do this bit and I do the bit for 

634
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:41,571
them and he's like,
oh,

635
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:43,300
that's funny.
And then he sees them.

636
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:43,830
Me,
Oh,

637
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:45,870
you do it so much better than the other 
guys.

638
00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:48,930
Got Too many words.
Too many words.

639
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,810
He's Irish.
Guilted into retarded.

640
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,790
Distracting you with admitted premise.

641
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,970
Um,
but anyway,

642
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:03,020
ms NBC got a swarm of emails like the,
these people like attacked,

643
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,070
know these alt right fellows attacked 
and started saying that this guy had 

644
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:16,020
tweeted a which essentially a rape joke 
and that we would never sponsored you 

645
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,960
and we're going to contact your 
sponsors.

646
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,040
This is what he said.
You got a thing covering over the,

647
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,570
a picture of it.
Don't care.

648
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,930
Oh,
I eat.

649
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,170
Oh,
go,

650
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,400
don't care our,
he polanski.

651
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,580
But I hope if my daughter is ever raped 
by an older truly talented man with a 

652
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:32,580
great.
Oh I.

653
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:37,650
But I hope if my daughter is ever raped,
it is by an older truly talented man 

654
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,680
with a great sense of Nissan Nissan 
scenes.

655
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,540
I don't know.
That's what it is,

656
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:45,970
is a,
this.

657
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,800
Here's the part,
here's the part of the problem.

658
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:49,840
He deleted this which he regrets doing 
it,

659
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,120
but it's a part of a series of tweets.

660
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:57,570
All of them that criticize people 
support of Roman Polanski because Roman 

661
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:02,300
Polanski had raped kids,
but he did really good films and he was 

662
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,130
like,
just fucking disgusting.

663
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,870
That is.
He was essentially saying,

664
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:09,970
this is a horrific way to look at this.
Like this guy raped a baby,

665
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,620
right?
He raped like a 13 year old.

666
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,610
Yeah.
Right.

667
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:17,890
So this was a part of a series of tweets
all expressing this and that was clearly

668
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:22,270
satire and MSNBC capitulated and they 
fired him.

669
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,310
And uh,
I,

670
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,380
you know,
I don't know him.

671
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,960
I know people who do know him,
some that like,

672
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:29,570
um,
you know,

673
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,900
and it's,
uh,

674
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,880
it is not,
I don't have a dog in this fight,

675
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:35,710
but that's crazy.
That's crazy.

676
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,980
If you look at what this,
the joke was and that the fact that he 

677
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,560
deleted it and then on top of that,
the.

678
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,730
Is he apologizing for it?

679
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,670
No,
he's not.

680
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:49,910
He's not.
What he did was he made a video 

681
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:50,360
explaining what the joke was,
why he said it,

682
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:54,980
and the fact that it was a part of a 
series of tweets that he said,

683
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,910
but it doesn't matter.
Once that fucking outrage machine,

684
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,550
I was just asked if I regret my tweet 
from 2009,

685
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:03,800
I regret.
Laziness led me to delete it.

686
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,970
I would never regret criticizing rape 
apologists.

687
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,140
And I agree with that tactic.
I don't know Sam Cedar.

688
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,500
I don't either,
but I know that he could probably start 

689
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,870
a podcast and make a decent living and 
not have to work for someone who's going

690
00:33:19,871 --> 00:33:20,660
to fire him.
Well,

691
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:25,661
he,
I think he has his own show minority 

692
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:25,661
report,
right?

693
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:26,270
Isn't that his own show?
He does that.

694
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:28,160
His own Internet show because that's 
what he loved it.

695
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,990
Yeah.
And you know,

696
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:32,150
and here's the other thing,
he isn't.

697
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,520
He had a dispute more than once,
I believe,

698
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:39,850
with my good friend Sam Harris.
And he accused Sam Harris of being the 

699
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,130
name.
Sounds familiar,

700
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,900
Sam Harrison,
neuroscientists.

701
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,790
Some people don't like that term.
They don't.

702
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,050
He's an author's runs,
has a podcast.

703
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:49,880
He's essentially an intellectual,
very,

704
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:51,050
very,
very smart guy.

705
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:53,000
Like one of the smartest guys I ever 
have my podcast.

706
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:58,001
So what was their beef?
Sam Harris believes that all ideologies 

707
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:00,290
are inherently dangerous and Islam is 
very problematic.

708
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:05,530
And many people on the left think that 
when you criticize Islam that you are 

709
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,490
some sort of a racist.
You're akin to a racist.

710
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,010
Whereas if you criticize Christianity 
here,

711
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:15,011
someone was just not a rube right 
against that weird thing because of 

712
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:19,240
brown skin and people's desire to not be
perceived as racist so they go way 

713
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,441
overboard with it and which is what's 
happening with the me too thing where 

714
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:27,851
you go,
I see all the benefits of people coming 

715
00:34:27,851 --> 00:34:29,530
out and it's putting the fear in a 
fucking.

716
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,600
Everybody who let me die,
fuck 20 years ago.

717
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,190
Exactly.
No,

718
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,130
but I just wanted to just for Sam Sake,
like he's not a racist by any stretch of

719
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:39,320
the imagination.
He doesn't like ideologies.

720
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:44,120
He doesn't like something that makes you
think that God wants you to kill people.

721
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,530
He doesn't want.
I mean,

722
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:48,110
whether or not you interpret that the 
way the Christians do.

723
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:53,350
I mean there's not a lot of people 
killing people over some shit from the 

724
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:53,350
Old Testament.
You know,

725
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,611
there's no one out there in the acting 
the rate the rates of God for people 

726
00:34:57,611 --> 00:34:58,280
wearing two different types of cloth.
Right.

727
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:03,310
Because Christians are generally better 
off and yeah,

728
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,730
once you get a lot of fucking toys and 
yeah.

729
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,740
You Dismiss a lot of that.
I should kill myself in the name of 

730
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:10,820
blank.
That's a fucking good point.

731
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:15,821
You know,
and I've always wondered if you look at 

732
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:15,950
like the Middle East,
you're not looking at like rushed,

733
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,100
lush tropical forests and beautiful 
beaches like Brazil.

734
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:24,370
You know where everybody's happy and 
they want to play fucking volleyball on 

735
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:24,370
the beach.
Do Jujitsu.

736
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:24,830
Everybody's having a party.
No,

737
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,830
it's not the Saudi princes,
they will still wear the garb,

738
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:31,010
but then once they get behind the gold 
plated palace doors.

739
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:36,250
Yeah,
there's dixit swinging and fucking 

740
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,800
champagne flowing,
but outside it's all sand for people

741
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:43,130
that have nothing better.
That's why Jesus works in the Mideast 

742
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:48,830
Midwest where you're in fucking Indiana 
and you have fields to plow and it's 

743
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,340
gonna be Shitty,
great.

744
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:55,670
Angry whether,
and maybe Jesus is the only thing 

745
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,581
getting you through another year,
another harvest and you put a marble on 

746
00:35:58,581 --> 00:36:02,211
the highway and it just sits there.
It doesn't keep rolling.

747
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,850
There's no hills bitch.
Snow hits the fucking worst.

748
00:36:05,851 --> 00:36:08,760
Indiana is the worst state in the 
country,

749
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,980
but even in Indiana they found gold and 
it became like Qatar.

750
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,300
Some shit.
They just,

751
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,870
you know,
they found oil,

752
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,960
they felt like some crazy new patch oil 
and all of a sudden they started 

753
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,201
building the world's tallest building 
there and the same kind of shit they do 

754
00:36:24,201 --> 00:36:26,130
in Dubai.
We do buy apparently is insane now.

755
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,310
They have indoor surfing things in Dubai
in the middle.

756
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,980
Did you get a surfboard and your indoor 
surfing?

757
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:37,250
You could ski in doors.
They've indoor skiing in Dubai and 

758
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:37,560
you're going to have that here in the 
compound.

759
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:43,100
Do you have a name for this new uh,
towns and it's kind of worn.

760
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,150
Yeah.
Plus I think Anthony Kumi,

761
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,100
Anthony Kumina,
who I have to give him his props to.

762
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,650
He's probably the reason why I started a
podcast.

763
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,700
It was,
first of all,

764
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:58,701
because he was a part of opiod anthony,
which was the first time I ever thought 

765
00:36:58,701 --> 00:37:01,791
like,
I really liked doing radio or the way 

766
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:01,791
opie and Anthony did it.
It was great.

767
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:01,791
We would come in.
You,

768
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:02,640
you have done it too,
right?

769
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:04,920
Yeah.
But I remember first doing it going,

770
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,750
wow,
am I the shitty episode?

771
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:09,720
Because no one really talked a lot.
We just had fun.

772
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,660
I know I,
it took me a minute to,

773
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,460
oh,
they just decided to do what they wanted

774
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:15,420
to do with radio.

775
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,480
I just thought I was boring because 
there's no bells and whistles and fake 

776
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,321
laughs and to this day I don't think 
opie and Anthony got the credit that it 

777
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:25,530
deserved because I think that they let 
us,

778
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,550
they let us like they're the best show.
They were the best show ever.

779
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:31,110
They don't exist anymore,
unfortunately,

780
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:36,150
but they were the best show ever to go 
on today exist in their own world?

781
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:38,160
They do.
I know Anthony does and he still has.

782
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,650
This was recently fired.
I don't,

783
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,620
I don't know what I just know.
He started his own thing.

784
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:49,530
Norton's still doing his thing with Sam 
Norton this still doing this thing with 

785
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,370
Sam and Norton does a thing with the UFC
too.

786
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:52,950
He does UFC uncensored with Matt Serra,
which is hilarious.

787
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,860
And Norton also does the chip chip 
person podcasts.

788
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,630
He does all that on his own now.
Yeah.

789
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,050
I've never listened to it,
but I've been tweeted about it enough to

790
00:38:01,051 --> 00:38:03,720
know that it's a character.
It's hilarious.

791
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,450
It's so uncomfortable.
It's so good.

792
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,220
It's one of my favorite things that he 
does.

793
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:13,221
It's fucking amazing.
You want to see a video of it right now 

794
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,030
we're in a live broadcast.
No,

795
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,040
but I'll pull it up sometimes.
I hated making people listen to 30 

796
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,110
seconds of Chacho.
It was good.

797
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,970
I liked it.
Good.

798
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,840
Let people know.
A lot of people don't know.

799
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,630
There's a lot of shit people don't know.
You know,

800
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,700
there's only one way to find out.
Someone has to tell you.

801
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:32,850
I find out from commercials that a 
little help at work,

802
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,410
you know?
I know coronas still sucks as beer,

803
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:37,480
but I liked the song that you use.
Thank you,

804
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,990
dear you.
Are they a sponsor to corona with a lime

805
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,510
feminine?

806
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,260
Some tropical climate and I want a beer,
but I don't really want a beer.

807
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,070
Yeah,
that's.

808
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,140
I want a soda,
but I want to stay drunk.

809
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,240
You know what a Moscow mule is?
Yeah.

810
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:51,100
What is that?
It's some drink,

811
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,380
but they,
uh,

812
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,910
there was a surplus of copper at the 
time.

813
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:57,570
So the guy in order to get rid of copper
said,

814
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:02,580
oh,
you have to drink it out of a copper 

815
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,171
cup,
and it was just a big room and now 

816
00:39:04,171 --> 00:39:06,151
copper and it's going to be in a copper 
cup and I don't know how they did that 

817
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:06,580
with corona and alive.
Oh No.

818
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:08,560
You put a lime in this beer.
Yeah,

819
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:09,430
that's true.
Right?

820
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:14,431
Why does it have a lime?
And every now and then someone sticks 

821
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:14,431
alignment at Dos equis and you're like,
what?

822
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,320
What is this?
What is this?

823
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:21,370
Wow.
You've become judgmental drinking years.

824
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,690
Yeah,
I'll get weird.

825
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,630
You know,
get weird when it comes to drinks.

826
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,380
But Corona is not a bad beer.
It's just not a strong beer.

827
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,740
It's fine.
When I'm in a place that's dark,

828
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:38,220
I like to drink real shit.
I like to drink like an IPA or Guinness 

829
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,601
or Jack Daniels.
That's what I like to drink in a 

830
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:43,000
darkened.
I like a dark wood environment.

831
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:45,310
This is Shitty neon lights.
This.

832
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:51,210
Your studio is a great dark.
This is a bar they I would go to.

833
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,390
I would go dark hardwood bar.
It's a little bright.

834
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,640
I'd be like,
it's kind of annoying in this place.

835
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,050
It's like if the cameras weren't on 
drinking,

836
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,480
this is no.
If you came out of that bright sunlight.

837
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,200
Oh yeah,
yeah,

838
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:08,010
yeah.
This would be common into this he brick,

839
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,560
especially if it's hot outside,
which by the way it might get hot here 

840
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:13,560
any minute now.

841
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,100
There is a fucking fire in Ventura and 
the winds are insane right now in the 

842
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,420
fire.
V Through Ventura is just tearing things

843
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:24,421
apart.
Got The alert on my phone and the Uber 

844
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:26,530
drive over.
Be careful warning warning's bad man.

845
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:31,531
I mean it is bad and it scares the shit 
out of me because I left a kid 

846
00:40:31,531 --> 00:40:31,570
somewhere.
Yes,

847
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,220
there's that for sure.
Um,

848
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:37,810
but what it scares the shit out of me is
that in the short term,

849
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,900
I think most people are going to get out
of there if they prepare and move 

850
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,471
accordingly.
But you gotta you gotta realize what 

851
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:49,801
this is like.
This is something that when you get a 

852
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:50,620
fire of this size,
it's burned back that up a little bit.

853
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:54,970
So you get the numbers just in today is 
burned 45,000

854
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:58,420
acres destroyed at least 150 structures,
force 20,000

855
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:00,250
people,
27,000

856
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,340
people to evacuate and they can't stop 
it.

857
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,990
They don't have enough manpower.
When when something is this big and it's

858
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:10,570
this strong and the winds are this 
fucking crazy.

859
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,600
You look at how those trees are blown 
over sideways and these fucking houses 

860
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,070
are up in flames and it's how do they 
even have enough water?

861
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:23,190
I have no idea.
I Live City Hall just burned down the 

862
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,800
city hall building and just them putting
the fire out.

863
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,800
Everyone's water went out.
It was not enough water.

864
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:33,160
You couldn't turn on your taps because 
they used it all to put out city all.

865
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,070
I wonder

866
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:39,070
if there's like a chart where you could 
see where you could go back to nine 

867
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,191
slash 11 and post nine slash 11.
How many women got impregnated by 

868
00:41:42,191 --> 00:41:43,340
firefighters?
Like how many?

869
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,800
Remember when firefighters,
like after nine slash 11,

870
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:48,530
remember they were real heroes.
People have kind of like taking them for

871
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:50,720
granted until they do something to 
actually save your house.

872
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:56,100
I used to do that bit about after nine 
slash 11 firefighters and cops are 

873
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,871
getting so much hero pussy.
They were launching it like a rotted 

874
00:42:00,871 --> 00:42:01,990
doctopus out of,
out of,

875
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,270
what do you call those?
Slingshots slingshots.

876
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,750
They'd have to swat him down with tennis
rackets.

877
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:11,110
I had this whole bit about Europe was so
true,

878
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,520
right?
Yeah.

879
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,390
No,
not.

880
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Well then the war came and then all the,
I think the bit was all the troops are 

881
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,711
getting the hero pussy that nine slash 
11 first responders used to get and now 

882
00:42:22,711 --> 00:42:24,310
they're just hanging around bars.
Go remember me?

883
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:31,410
Yeah man.
Do you know Google has this crazy thing 

884
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,710
on his phone when I was paying attention
to recently where you,

885
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:34,750
um,
you say something like,

886
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:36,040
hello,
my name is Doug Stanhope.

887
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,980
And then it translates it out loud to 
someone else.

888
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,640
Like through your phone,
they talk to your phone and they'll say,

889
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:43,920
you know,
may Abolo Pedro.

890
00:42:43,921 --> 00:42:45,090
I am,
I,

891
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,320
they go through the thing.
It translates it and then it changes it 

892
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,050
in your ear to what English is the 
English version of that apple fish.

893
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:57,370
What's it called?
Babel fish was on the hitchhiker's guide

894
00:42:57,371 --> 00:42:58,750
to the galaxy.
Oh,

895
00:42:58,751 --> 00:43:03,120
okay.
So apple fish as a fish.

896
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,290
I saw this.
It's a new feature on this phone call,

897
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,570
the Google Pixel,
and I said,

898
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,080
I don't think people.
And you have to have these Pixel earbuds

899
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:15,110
that do it,
or you can actually do it through the 

900
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:15,110
phone,
I think without the ear buds,

901
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:15,790
but I don't think people understand how 
crazy this is.

902
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,980
Like if they're just starting this thing
out,

903
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:20,320
like it used to be.
You couldn't really talk to your phone.

904
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:25,620
Now you could.
You could do a google search by just 

905
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:25,890
pressing that speaker button and say who
is Brian Hennigan?

906
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:31,110
And then a boot put in like seconds.
It'll pull up your wikipedia who doug 

907
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,480
stanhope in seconds,
like what is going to.

908
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:38,670
If they can do this thing right,
we're going to have a thing in our ear 

909
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:42,600
like little earbud and you're gonna be 
able to talk to people all over the 

910
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,390
fucking planet.
It's going to get super strange.

911
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:48,630
People that speak Arabic languages,
so people that in South America you're 

912
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:49,640
going to get.

913
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:54,520
I still every so many of these 
technological advances,

914
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,150
I think about you and your bits back in 
the day.

915
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:03,660
Why do they have all these things on the
cell phone that replaced what a cell 

916
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,390
phone is?
Yeah.

917
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,960
Well,
why you making me read texts me,

918
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,990
it takes me four buttons to make an act 
and ask.

919
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:12,910
Call me.
Just call me.

920
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:18,630
Back then.
I would've never thought that text 

921
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,881
messaging would become popular.
That there's a bit that you could never 

922
00:44:20,881 --> 00:44:21,610
do today.
I could only do that bit in 2005.

923
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,080
When it was like people were starting to
send you text messages like without fuck

924
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,270
is this.
You would get on your phone.

925
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,020
You'd go,
why don't you just call me stupid?

926
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,320
Why are you making me reply with my 
thumb?

927
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,040
Well,
that's

928
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:37,780
awkward.
Shows how much you don't really want to 

929
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,010
talk to your friends.
I don't want to have to say,

930
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,120
hey,
how you been?

931
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,070
What's going on?
How's the kids?

932
00:44:41,071 --> 00:44:42,080
How's your sister?
Yeah.

933
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:47,130
I just need one simple response.
I respect Joey Diaz for that.

934
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,620
Joey Diaz will not do that with you and 
I think he's right.

935
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,870
I'm thinking about it more and more 
lately.

936
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,570
Have these weird text message 
conversations with the people.

937
00:44:54,571 --> 00:44:56,250
I'm like,
why am I doing this?

938
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,990
I need to look at you.
You need to know.

939
00:44:57,991 --> 00:45:00,840
I like you like the friends.
If we're going to socialize,

940
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:02,430
don't text me.
Hey,

941
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:05,340
how's it going?
That's a bar conversation.

942
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:10,341
You can see me in a bar.
I don't want to sit and catch up via 

943
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:10,341
text.
Hey,

944
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,420
how about that one in a long time?
Hey,

945
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,140
have I just.
Hey.

946
00:45:14,141 --> 00:45:14,610
Yeah.
Hey,

947
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:16,760
fuck.
Is this?

948
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:17,420
What?
Are you 12?

949
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,320
You can't get my phone.
Kids got my phone number.

950
00:45:21,321 --> 00:45:22,370
Motherfucker.
What's going on?

951
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:27,550
Hey,
see me in a bar and then sit down and 

952
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:27,550
say,
Hey,

953
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:28,220
12 what?
Hey.

954
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,560
Hi.
You can say that to your friend.

955
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,080
Like,
Hey,

956
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,710
hey.
Yeah.

957
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:38,020
Yeah,
but usually that's the extent of what I 

958
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,020
have to say.
Anyway.

959
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,020
Got It.
All right.

960
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,980
High Five,
high five on text,

961
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,080
but you'd probably have a,
an Emoji.

962
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,930
Can't hey on text and you definitely 
can't do.

963
00:45:44,931 --> 00:45:48,430
You can't yo you lazy.
Fuck you want to talk?

964
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,180
You ain't got shit to say.
Yo.

965
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,470
I need affirmation that we're still 
friends,

966
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,100
just,
you know,

967
00:45:55,190 --> 00:46:00,190
it's kind of part of the business.
We're not going to be close friends over

968
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,690
a quarter of a century just because of 
text messaging.

969
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:08,050
I don't live in your town.
You're going to lose Brownie points if 

970
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:08,660
you just type Yo.
You're going to have to have like,

971
00:46:08,661 --> 00:46:11,630
Yo,
are we still having lunch?

972
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,750
Yo,
are we going to the game?

973
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:17,150
Like I texted you a week ago.
Hey,

974
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:22,151
what time are we doing that podcast?
Because he's supposed to set up other 

975
00:46:22,151 --> 00:46:26,321
shit around it,
but then I said in parentheses that I 

976
00:46:26,321 --> 00:46:27,710
don't want to do,
so I'm glad you didn't get back to me.

977
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,560
I'm so glad I helped you.
Yes you did.

978
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:35,650
We going to procrastinate broken.
I go Rogan's podcast or like nine hours 

979
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:36,710
and we're not going to be able to fit 
other ones in.

980
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,230
It's unfortunate,
but what is fortunate it is.

981
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,050
This is not famous available right now.
Ladies and gentlemen,

982
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,720
Joe Rogan stories are in there.
Oh beautiful.

983
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,220
It has an index.
I do have.

984
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,100
I have a lot of fucking name drops in 
there.

985
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,440
We had some good times,
you know that the story that we were 

986
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,320
talking about in question you have to 
read about in the book,

987
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:59,470
but it involves Doug,
Stan hope and I in the desert that Dale.

988
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:04,380
I'm sure we've talked about it.
I know we have too many times.

989
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,060
Then afterwards go into that Lakers game
few days later.

990
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:08,930
Yeah.
That was a weird one,

991
00:47:08,931 --> 00:47:09,990
right?
Yeah.

992
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,630
In the height of nine slash 11 patriotic
fever and was like,

993
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,460
this is nuts.
You guys are going crazy.

994
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:18,260
Like you're standing up for a basketball
game.

995
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:23,900
This is.
I remember when you picked me up at 

996
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,750
curse on for that game.
You add a,

997
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,140
I don't know,
an suv of some kind of.

998
00:47:27,141 --> 00:47:30,280
It's probably a suburban.
Was pissing off in Denali.

999
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,460
You've got a white Yukon Denali and you 
were pissing out the door while we were 

1000
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,181
high on mushrooms going 65 miles an hour
down the highway deaths door open and 

1001
00:47:39,181 --> 00:47:42,400
he's like pissing out the door.
Probably Piss all over my truck,

1002
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,670
but this is as the wars kicking off.
Two thousand three,

1003
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:47,770
I believe.
We saw the war.

1004
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:51,040
We saw the war kickoff.
I'm like,

1005
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,780
it was the superbowl like it was 
planned.

1006
00:47:52,781 --> 00:47:55,710
I spell all this out and you will.
You said it.

1007
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,430
I remember you said it.
You said,

1008
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,080
oh my God,
there's a kickoff.

1009
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:04,260
We were ahead of the curve.
Joe Rogan was with technology because 

1010
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:09,580
when you pick me up in that,
that's the first time I heard gps say in

1011
00:48:09,581 --> 00:48:11,800
400 feet.
Take a right onto the one.

1012
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:16,801
Oh one.
And also you had cell phone video 

1013
00:48:16,801 --> 00:48:18,100
because you videotaped me pissing out 
your door.

1014
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,070
Just 2003.
It was 2003.

1015
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,530
You know the best picture I ever took on
my cell phone.

1016
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:26,740
This is like affirmed the need to have a
camera on you at all times.

1017
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,920
I was in downtown La and there was this 
overweight black hooker with a crazy wig

1018
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:37,891
on and sunglasses and she was eating a 
meatball sub and I looked over and she 

1019
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:39,850
goes,
hey baby.

1020
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:44,940
And she pulls her tit out and she's got 
her tit and one hand and I took a 

1021
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:45,490
picture of this.
See if you can find that.

1022
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,320
It's.
I know it's out there.

1023
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,030
I know it's out there.
I couldn't.

1024
00:48:49,031 --> 00:48:50,620
It's,
it looks so amazing.

1025
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:51,970
I couldn't,
I couldn't believe it,

1026
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,630
and I took it with one of those Motorola
flip phones back in 2000 because we were

1027
00:48:55,631 --> 00:49:00,631
filming fear factor downtown La and this
lady was walking around with their tear 

1028
00:49:00,631 --> 00:49:00,631
out.

1029
00:49:00,631 --> 00:49:00,631
I was like,
this is a lawyer.

1030
00:49:00,631 --> 00:49:05,490
She was smiling and laughing and I took 
a picture of her with her tit out and 

1031
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,260
uh,
to me to this day is like,

1032
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:13,980
now I know.
Why wouldn't want to know that you're 

1033
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:13,980
taking a picture.
Nobody knew anything.

1034
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,670
Nobody knew anything.
It was like to,

1035
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,280
to think that just a few years later the
iphone will come out,

1036
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:20,200
you know,
2007.

1037
00:49:20,201 --> 00:49:25,201
The iphone comes out and now you can't 
imagine anybody not have one of 

1038
00:49:25,201 --> 00:49:25,930
everything.
If you,

1039
00:49:25,931 --> 00:49:30,931
if you,
if you're around someone and they don't 

1040
00:49:30,931 --> 00:49:30,931
have a smartphone,
you look at it like there's some kind of

1041
00:49:30,931 --> 00:49:35,011
freak.
Becker is the only one that becker my 

1042
00:49:35,011 --> 00:49:36,700
oldest best friend from forever still 
doesn't have a cell phone.

1043
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,980
Yeah.
My friend Steve doesn't have a phone.

1044
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,600
His wife fucking hates state.
It is.

1045
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,880
That's the picture.
That's a real picture.

1046
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,910
Please take a screenshot of that and 
save it for me because I keep losing it.

1047
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:48,160
Why do you say that?
So happy,

1048
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,620
but come on son.
Look at that picture.

1049
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:56,380
She's enormous.
She's got a meatball sub in her hand.

1050
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,990
It's the perfect picture.
Jamie,

1051
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,010
I want you to order up a large hd 
version of this.

1052
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:04,950
Have some scientists convert that we're 
gonna.

1053
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:07,240
Make a poster out of that.
That needs to be on the wall.

1054
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:09,430
One hundred percent.
Put it on.

1055
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:11,380
You know,
don't put it on Youtube,

1056
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,730
but that's got to remind me of this.
Get the crew on it.

1057
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,190
We need to have that photo on our wall.
That's my one of my happiest moments.

1058
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,840
I swear to God.
I went back to work.

1059
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:25,990
I was fucking howled and laughing 
because I had a lady was funny.

1060
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:27,290
She looked at me,
Oh,

1061
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,040
you want some of this?

1062
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,370
And she pulled the content out and then 
she smiles and starts laughing at me.

1063
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,650
All the while she's eating a meatball 
sub.

1064
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:39,410
That's a great picture.
Palming that sub like it's a a 45 and a 

1065
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:44,950
old west shootout and God helped her tit
the way she's got a death grip on that 

1066
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:47,180
ticket.
I was like,

1067
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,340
she gets some sort of a cobra choke.
That's.

1068
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:49,960
Yeah,
that's,

1069
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:52,700
that's how I have to choke my dick to 
keep it up when I'm drunk.

1070
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:56,830
You get almost like your whole cock ring
queue.

1071
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:02,190
Like you get it,
like you're making a bridge pinching 

1072
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,811
down on your dick a hard fight.
The boobs fight.

1073
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:08,000
The Bose Mr.
Penis.

1074
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,040
Yeah.
That's a great picture though.

1075
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,140
That's an important moment for me 
because I'm like,

1076
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:13,670
okay,
now I know I'm into this stuff.

1077
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:18,671
It was so I could capture that picture.
I was happy for days because I remember 

1078
00:51:18,671 --> 00:51:20,510
looking at it go and that's real.
Like I always see those.

1079
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:23,510
You see those crazy pictures online,
you know who took that,

1080
00:51:23,511 --> 00:51:25,460
what happened?
But I took that.

1081
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,290
I was there.
I like that was real,

1082
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,150
like it was really.
I didn't pay that lady.

1083
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,760
It was just happened to be.
I said hi to her.

1084
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:36,850
I had my phone out and she looked at me 
and pulled her tit out and I hit the 

1085
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:37,880
camera button.
Then it got it.

1086
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:41,060
So it wasn't supposed to happen.

1087
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:47,780
That is your sailor kissing the girl in 
Times Square.

1088
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,860
Thank you.
Thank you,

1089
00:51:48,861 --> 00:51:50,360
Mr Hannigan.
You're right.

1090
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:54,440
Planting the flag at all.
Accept that.

1091
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,510
I feel like it's my magnum opus Codec.
Choke it.

1092
00:51:59,511 --> 00:52:00,810
It might've been the best thing I've 
ever done.

1093
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:03,830
Needs a cocktail.
I get ice right here.

1094
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,500
I don't like that.
That lady is doing that for a living.

1095
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,260
I was not doing a wish her living 
anymore.

1096
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:14,300
Probably dead,
but I wish our prosperity and happiness 

1097
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,100
and I hope she found Jesus the next 
moment after I took that picture.

1098
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,430
And then.
But you can't fix everybody,

1099
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,470
but sometimes you just got to let people
be crazy.

1100
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:22,700
I remember,
uh,

1101
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,920
well several people that have women of a
certain age or a look or they go,

1102
00:52:29,151 --> 00:52:30,770
yeah,
but what else?

1103
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,500
What else am I going to do?
I'm going to suck Dick for a living.

1104
00:52:33,501 --> 00:52:35,300
I'm going to go out on the street and 
you go,

1105
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,900
you couldn't like,
you know ones,

1106
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,840
but then you watch like cops or 
something.

1107
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:46,010
When you see a lady like that,
it's getting caught in a pickup truck.

1108
00:52:46,011 --> 00:52:48,050
Stuck in some old dudes,
Dick and you go.

1109
00:52:48,051 --> 00:52:49,330
I guess you could.
You could.

1110
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:50,480
She could.
You could.

1111
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:55,500
So you could.
She's empowering to women is what I'm 

1112
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,250
saying.
It entirely depends with the Mail on how

1113
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:00,890
horny you are because if your crazy 
horny,

1114
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:04,040
I've done some bad things.
We'll do some terrible things.

1115
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:06,620
Were monsters,
bad bad animals.

1116
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:11,621
It's a bad design.
The design where you have to get rid of 

1117
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:12,650
them all the time is terrible.
Design.

1118
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,100
It would be way better.
I do a lot.

1119
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:21,130
It's an old bit of yours that I quote a 
lot is you're a post come depression.

1120
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,590
Is that how it goes?
A postnet depression.

1121
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:27,750
Yeah.
That feeling that which is so like I,

1122
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:30,840
I really believed I liked her.
Yes.

1123
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,280
Wasn't until.
Oh,

1124
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:37,800
and as the semen as rifling out of you,
you go,

1125
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,870
oh,
I misled her.

1126
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,690
Oh my God.
I misled myself.

1127
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:47,250
Which that's where you get scared with 
the me too thing.

1128
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:53,270
I know I didn't rape anyone,
but how many times might I have led a 

1129
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:58,071
woman astray with promises of 
everlasting love and harmony just 

1130
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:03,540
because I was drunk and wanted to fuck 
her and then didn't call.

1131
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:06,230
I was inappropriate afterwards.
I didn't do the,

1132
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,500
hey,
um,

1133
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:12,560
I don't think we're right for each other
and she's stewing about it somewhere and

1134
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:18,021
wants are you can't meet to me.
It definitely can happen like that.

1135
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:23,421
Right?
It's like you got to leave room for all 

1136
00:54:23,421 --> 00:54:25,521
possibilities because I think that to 
trust everyone that comes forward with a

1137
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:29,380
story like you shouldn't.
What?

1138
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:32,370
You should be open minded about all the 
points of view.

1139
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,400
Like I would,
I'd hate to see someone get in trouble 

1140
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,901
for something they didn't do because 
they dated a gal and she hated them and 

1141
00:54:41,901 --> 00:54:44,520
so she made up some stuff and this has 
happened before.

1142
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,360
Oh,
absolutely.

1143
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:46,470
People,
you've got to be.

1144
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,210
Let me give you an example.
Please do.

1145
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:53,510
How many.
Maybe we should clarify because this is 

1146
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:53,510
a touchy subject.
No,

1147
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:57,250
I know you're not a sexist by any 
imagination in support of the alleged 

1148
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:03,360
witch hunt because it is making people 
who are serious abusers and there's one 

1149
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:06,050
I fucking want to out but I don't have 
to,

1150
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,710
but it's not going to be,
you know,

1151
00:55:07,711 --> 00:55:12,711
that it's real and then you know that 
people in positions of power like that 

1152
00:55:12,711 --> 00:55:13,290
to have people working under them are 
dependent upon them in that way.

1153
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:18,680
They will prey on them and do weird shit
to them and they've been doing it 

1154
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,580
forever because they can get away with 
it and that seems to be like,

1155
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:26,510
that seems to be how this town in a lot 
of ways was designed how the whole porn 

1156
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:27,990
industry was set up.

1157
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:33,360
But you have to.
There's a willingness on both sides.

1158
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:34,900
Hopefully.
Well,

1159
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:38,310
I think that there's a lot of girls that
will fuck you for a part.

1160
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,750
I don't think it's that.
See,

1161
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:41,360
that's not the thing.
It's not like,

1162
00:55:41,361 --> 00:55:42,210
um,
again,

1163
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:47,211
there's a million.
The me to encapture encapsulates a lot 

1164
00:55:47,701 --> 00:55:52,701
of different stages of sexual abuse 
variances from.

1165
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,900
I always like to think of it.
I have a sister mother rule,

1166
00:55:58,370 --> 00:56:03,370
especially as I've gotten older,
like a thought about this for so long 

1167
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:07,260
and I feel like you have to treat every,
like if you're in any,

1168
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:10,440
you have to look at every situation.
Like what would that be like?

1169
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,870
If I found out that happened to my 
mother,

1170
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,710
what would that be like if I found out 
that happened to my sister.

1171
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:21,830
I mean if you go to children then it 
gets really crazy and you get super 

1172
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:23,640
psychotic and because your protective as
well.

1173
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:24,070
Although I'm

1174
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,090
very protective of my sister,
you get that.

1175
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:32,100
You got to almost look at it like that 
and I don't think we get taught that 

1176
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:32,100
enough.
You know?

1177
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,110
I think it takes us a long time of 
living as an adult to sort of figure out

1178
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:37,300
like who's the Dick here?
Is it me or is it them?

1179
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:42,301
Or is it my making bad choices?
Am I arguing with people and getting 

1180
00:56:42,301 --> 00:56:45,661
these weird relationships with people 
that I really don't belong with in the 

1181
00:56:45,661 --> 00:56:48,631
first place.
Maybe I need to figure out who the fuck 

1182
00:56:48,631 --> 00:56:51,391
I am before I do this.
Like there's all these different things 

1183
00:56:51,391 --> 00:56:53,641
that happen in a relationship and a lot 
of times along the way people get into 

1184
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:57,280
some know,
some weird spaces in their life,

1185
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:57,790
you know,

1186
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:03,390
man show the secretary that we had,
you weren't around for a lot of it 

1187
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:07,210
because you were doing.
Unfortunately I work 14 hours a day.

1188
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,730
Then man,
shelf for four hours.

1189
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:13,900
They need to do an hour at the comedy 
store for 30 minutes about her.

1190
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,390
But no,
we didn't know what you gonna sell it.

1191
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:20,640
I'm just like the amount that we abused 
or on what we would think is a comedy 

1192
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:22,270
level.
Me and Andy,

1193
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:24,400
not you,
you weren't there,

1194
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:29,560
but do it back to you guys too.
But if it was on paper,

1195
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,040
but if she had a change of heart right 
now and said,

1196
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:38,070
oh,
I want to be part of the me too thing 

1197
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:38,980
and here's my story because I want to be
noticed.

1198
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:42,040
You can't do it to me because I'm not 
famous fortunately.

1199
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:47,080
Do you think this is one of those like 
swing one way and then swing back and 

1200
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,950
normalize things or do you think that 
this.

1201
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,920
But I think it might be,
but as time goes on,

1202
00:57:51,921 --> 00:57:55,370
I wonder if I just,
this is,

1203
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:58,910
and this is not,
is not saying anything like in,

1204
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,460
in any way,
uh,

1205
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:05,090
I don't want to be judgmental,
but I have a weird idea that men,

1206
00:58:05,091 --> 00:58:10,091
women,
when they're working together in small 

1207
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:10,760
boxes for long periods of time,
year on year,

1208
00:58:10,761 --> 00:58:15,761
that becomes their environment.
And that becomes the way they think 

1209
00:58:15,761 --> 00:58:15,761
about the outside world.

1210
00:58:15,761 --> 00:58:20,450
This is us.
This is really important because in 

1211
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:24,141
comedy,
the man shall remember we had to do 

1212
00:58:24,141 --> 00:58:24,930
sexual harassment training.
Yeah.

1213
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,050
For a show that's basically about sexual
harassment.

1214
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,570
And it was.
But in comedy,

1215
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:35,690
yeah,
we think that we can get away with all 

1216
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,170
this shit.
So I find myself extrapolating that on a

1217
00:58:37,171 --> 00:58:42,171
people that are in a workplace,
I don't know what it's like to work in 

1218
00:58:42,171 --> 00:58:42,300
an office where the boss says,
Hey,

1219
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:47,220
you can move up to assistant regional 
director if you watch me jerk off.

1220
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,480
And that's a different thing.
And it's,

1221
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:55,610
that's a real problem.
And the man is the only time I've kind 

1222
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:59,411
of hit like the corporate world,
cross corners of comedy meets corporate 

1223
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:04,630
where he is.
Someone might be in the story I have in 

1224
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:08,211
here that I couldn't have known when we 
turn this book in final draft that this 

1225
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:10,710
current climate would exist.

1226
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,830
So.
So there's a bunch of stories.

1227
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:18,330
Where do you remember mandic?
What was the mandate waves?

1228
00:59:18,331 --> 00:59:20,940
I get a assistant producer,
director guy.

1229
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,960
He was one that we all fucking hated.
He was just a ruthless Douche.

1230
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:31,540
And then when we went up to.
This is the story that's in the book at 

1231
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,860
the Bunny Ranch and Dennis Hoff tells us
both,

1232
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:39,070
hey,
you can have one of my girls on the 

1233
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:41,261
house.
Carrot top is fucked my girls so and so 

1234
00:59:41,261 --> 00:59:42,800
is fucked my girls.
And rogue is like A.

1235
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,000
First of all,
not only am I married,

1236
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:49,001
but I wouldn't want to be in that litany
of names that you dropped that of other 

1237
00:59:49,001 --> 00:59:50,300
celebrities that have fucked your 
hookers.

1238
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:50,930
He's like,
no,

1239
00:59:50,931 --> 00:59:52,160
no,
I wouldn't drop your name.

1240
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:52,750
We played

1241
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,920
pretty women.
Remember that?

1242
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:58,220
Pretty woman for those ladies that 
worked there.

1243
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,460
Oh,
well that was the gag we did.

1244
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,010
No,
I don't remember anything.

1245
01:00:02,011 --> 01:00:03,000
We did the match.

1246
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:08,580
It was weird.
It bummed me out because like they were 

1247
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:11,881
crying and some of them wouldn't montage
that they wished that that had been the 

1248
01:00:12,101 --> 01:00:15,010
case and that someone would come and 
rescue them.

1249
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,210
I was like,
God damn it.

1250
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,350
Like this isn't funny.

1251
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,110
Yeah,
turn now.

1252
01:00:19,111 --> 01:00:21,060
I remember it.
Now that you say it,

1253
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:22,240
dude,
for me man.

1254
01:00:22,241 --> 01:00:23,380
I was like,
Oh God.

1255
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,970
You almost like,
I,

1256
01:00:24,971 --> 01:00:27,520
uh,
I've adopted a lot of dogs in my life,

1257
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,760
you know,
and I've taken on a lot of friend 

1258
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,461
projects,
especially when I was young that enough 

1259
01:00:35,461 --> 01:00:38,761
things have happened that lead me to 
believe that I have a lot of like a 

1260
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:43,020
rescue in parenting type feelings about 
nurturing people that feel like they're 

1261
01:00:43,451 --> 01:00:46,840
in danger by themselves now.
Very vulnerable.

1262
01:00:46,841 --> 01:00:48,010
So when I see something like that and 
I'm like,

1263
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:48,970
Oh,
Christ,

1264
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,820
you know,
I just,

1265
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:56,060
you realize you don't,
you don't really realize because you 

1266
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,821
know,
you don't see their lives on a daily 

1267
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,391
basis,
but you realize in that moment you're 

1268
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:00,391
like,
oh,

1269
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:00,391
this isn't funny at all.
And you know,

1270
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:05,020
there's no way to like you think things 
are funny on paper,

1271
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,160
like you think,
ah,

1272
01:01:06,161 --> 01:01:11,161
this is going to be funny.
We'll show a bunch of prostitutes a 

1273
01:01:11,161 --> 01:01:14,620
video about a lady who was prostitution 
going,

1274
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,360
white guy,
the perfect guy.

1275
01:01:16,361 --> 01:01:19,120
And then they fell in love and it worked
out.

1276
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:23,890
He rescued her man Dick.
I don't remember that.

1277
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,870
He's,
he was an assistant.

1278
01:01:26,871 --> 01:01:31,871
He was in charge enough that he absolute
power corrupts absolutely.

1279
01:01:32,511 --> 01:01:37,511
While he was an absolutely powerful,
but he was absolutely fucking annoying 

1280
01:01:37,511 --> 01:01:41,920
and we didn't like him,
but I still have this offer on the 

1281
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,891
table.
They're wrapping up the shoot the last 

1282
01:01:44,891 --> 01:01:44,891
night.
They're picking up all the equipment.

1283
01:01:44,891 --> 01:01:47,210
I'm talking to air force amy,
who's this veteran.

1284
01:01:47,211 --> 01:01:50,150
Hilarious hookers who's been there.
Yeah,

1285
01:01:50,151 --> 01:01:52,790
she fucking carried me through that 
whole thing.

1286
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:56,540
We just sit and drink at the bar and 
laugh at everything.

1287
01:01:56,541 --> 01:01:58,850
Inappropriate and talk shit.
And I go,

1288
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:01,790
hey,
we get this freebie from Dennis Hoff.

1289
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,830
I know he's going to have to pay you.
So,

1290
01:02:03,831 --> 01:02:08,831
uh,
how about I just a jerk off in front of 

1291
01:02:08,831 --> 01:02:09,800
you while you deldot yourself.
You get paid.

1292
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:11,260
We come back to the bar.
Yeah.

1293
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:14,360
Great.
She's Deldot at herself.

1294
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:16,210
I dark gfe come back to.

1295
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:21,220
I come out of the room,
which is right around the corner from 

1296
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,801
the.
I'm covered in a t shirt with my own 

1297
01:02:23,801 --> 01:02:26,620
ges.
All I need to do is wait to find 

1298
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:26,620
wardrobe.
I get a new t shirt.

1299
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:30,360
I walk out.
This guy that we hate is wrapping up.

1300
01:02:30,361 --> 01:02:34,470
He's walking up the stairs as I'm 
walking down the stairs to the bar and I

1301
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:35,970
go mandate.
Great.

1302
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:36,990
Shoot.
Good hair.

1303
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:40,590
Fucking hug it in and I hug him in front
of all these people at the bar.

1304
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:45,591
Who knows?
I just jerked and I'm smearing it into 

1305
01:02:45,591 --> 01:02:47,730
an illegal.
Yeah,

1306
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:50,560
I've done it.
That's a me too.

1307
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:55,980
That guys from the corporate world.
I smeared them with just to humiliate 

1308
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:55,980
him.
Oh my God.

1309
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:59,010
How fucking wrong could I like,
it's terrible.

1310
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,740
I shouldn't be completely outed for made
this up.

1311
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,130
I'd send the book,
but I hope I'm selling the whole book of

1312
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,630
Hashtag [inaudible] first.

1313
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:08,700
Not me too.
Interesting.

1314
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:10,440
I,
uh,

1315
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:15,330
I want to say that this last piece by Mr
Doug Stanhope was fiction and A.

1316
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:17,100
Well,
I had to change his name.

1317
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,440
So it was a nickname man who was telling
me that,

1318
01:03:19,441 --> 01:03:24,441
uh,
trump's lawyer said that he tweeted for 

1319
01:03:24,441 --> 01:03:24,441
trump.
Trump said something that was fucked up.

1320
01:03:24,441 --> 01:03:24,810
Trump's lawyer was like,
no,

1321
01:03:24,811 --> 01:03:25,080
no,
no.

1322
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,870
I tweeted that one for him.
Oh,

1323
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:33,950
alright.
I've been getting a lot of tweets that 

1324
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:33,950
say,
Hey,

1325
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:33,950
my lawyer wrote that,
and I'm like,

1326
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:34,230
I don't know.
I didn't know what it meant is.

1327
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,000
Come on.
How fucking funny is that?

1328
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:41,060
I have,
I have a whole chapter about pulling my 

1329
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:41,060
dick out.
I used to do that all the time.

1330
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,610
I'd go on stage naked or pull my dick.
I remember those days.

1331
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,920
Yeah,
the dark days I was,

1332
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:50,100
I was thinner than.
So I just have a different meaning.

1333
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:52,020
I gave him a bunch of pictures,
Hennigan here,

1334
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,880
the,
the Scotsman I pulled out.

1335
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:57,210
I pulled my dick out in front of Bert 
Kreischer on a podcast two nights ago.

1336
01:03:57,211 --> 01:04:00,360
I can't remember.
I can't remember why we were so fucked.

1337
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,370
I've been begging him not to air it 
because I don't know what I said,

1338
01:04:03,371 --> 01:04:06,480
but I've seen Ari's Dick About 100 times
what?

1339
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:11,510
So for the book I sent a bunch of 
pictures with Hennigan to pick and 

1340
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:14,610
choose and then they took all these dick
pics of me in public and I'm like,

1341
01:04:14,611 --> 01:04:16,920
you can't have all the picture section,
just my Dick.

1342
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:21,120
So I had to decide.
So this one I decided on this not having

1343
01:04:21,121 --> 01:04:26,121
any idea it could be so perfectly timed.
The top one is me with my dick out in a 

1344
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:29,280
kilt in front of a blind guy at Karaoke 
while he's singing,

1345
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:34,610
having no idea,
but the one below it is me starting to 

1346
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:35,640
pull my dick out in front of Louis.

1347
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:41,400
Oh my jerk off in front of the abusers.
Wow.

1348
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,280
Did you find crime?
I didn't have to block the door.

1349
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:46,980
He didn't block the door folks,
by the way,

1350
01:04:46,981 --> 01:04:48,390
that's not.
That's not real.

1351
01:04:48,391 --> 01:04:53,391
Apparently.
That's like something that like gets 

1352
01:04:53,391 --> 01:04:56,091
passed on.
Like an urban myth that juices up the 

1353
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:56,091
story.
I'm saving this for tomorrow.

1354
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:59,710
I'm doing a dork forest with Jackie 
cation and Lori Kilmartin,

1355
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:04,730
so I'm saving the bulk of my Lori,
my Louis C K for that,

1356
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:08,880
just because they are ladies I want.
There are going solid opinion,

1357
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:12,030
but I,
I'm,

1358
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:17,320
I have to make this so spacious timewise
because I don't want to out the person,

1359
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:18,010
but

1360
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:23,010
I was doing comedy and I was a comedian.
I knew back in the day when we were 

1361
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:28,150
young in another millennium,
just blame it on Brown.

1362
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:33,300
She said,
you're never going to guess what I just 

1363
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:33,300
did.
I just watched Louis C K jerk off in the

1364
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,890
ladies room and I went,
why don't she goes,

1365
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:36,400
yeah.
He said,

1366
01:05:36,401 --> 01:05:37,210
Hey,
would you?

1367
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:38,590
She's like,
I don't care.

1368
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:42,790
And as we've caught up many,
many years later,

1369
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:43,360
she goes,
yeah,

1370
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:45,940
I just did it because it was funny.
I really,

1371
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:50,140
I did it because it was a story to tell 
and I said,

1372
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:55,200
you coming forward.
Because afterwards when she said what 

1373
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,200
she told me that I go,
you never watched me jerk off.

1374
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:00,550
Got To watch the beach or I pull my dick
out and put on for this.

1375
01:06:00,551 --> 01:06:01,830
You Watch,
you watch.

1376
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:02,950
No,
she just said,

1377
01:06:02,951 --> 01:06:03,640
yeah,
I don't care.

1378
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:04,710
Whatever.
She like.

1379
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:09,790
It's no fun if you don't watch.
The way I remember it is that she 

1380
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:09,790
remembers me saying,
if you don't like it,

1381
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:11,680
don't look either way.
It was just a goof.

1382
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:14,200
She were.
I think you have to stand up to.

1383
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,510
I think what we should do to normalize 
this whole.

1384
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:17,140
Luis,
hang on.

1385
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:19,840
This is the important part of this is 
when I said,

1386
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:25,110
are you going to come out?
She can't because she just did it 

1387
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,831
because it was funny of course,
and she would almost be putting a place 

1388
01:06:28,831 --> 01:06:33,670
where she would be as it's people like 
you that made him into a monster.

1389
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:37,510
We're just kind of a goof back that no 
one cared.

1390
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:42,540
It's only weird and it was very polite.
So when I heard the Louis ck stories 

1391
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:45,520
later on,
I just assumed it was like that.

1392
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,550
He was very polite.
Hey,

1393
01:06:48,551 --> 01:06:49,840
would you watch me jerk off?

1394
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:53,680
Well,
I had heard from someone else that I had

1395
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:58,710
talked to someone who had gotten the 
story from Louis and the version of it 

1396
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:03,001
through the grape vine.
So don't take this as like verbatim was 

1397
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:03,400
something along the lines of.
No,

1398
01:07:03,401 --> 01:07:06,610
it was just,
he thought it was silly to like pull his

1399
01:07:06,611 --> 01:07:10,210
dick out and take pictures with them and
that I had heard that he was saying that

1400
01:07:10,211 --> 01:07:15,211
it wasn't,
he didn't actually masturbate in front 

1401
01:07:15,211 --> 01:07:15,280
of them.
That was like one version of it.

1402
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:16,300
So I was like,
okay,

1403
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:21,301
well maybe that what?
And then the full story came out and I 

1404
01:07:21,301 --> 01:07:21,301
went,
oh okay.

1405
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:23,650
And then someone had said,
yeah,

1406
01:07:23,651 --> 01:07:25,300
but he asked them first.
I was like,

1407
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,550
Oh boy,
what are we doing with this?

1408
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:33,580
This is another important beat is my 
story happened before he was in any 

1409
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:37,540
position of power other than comics 
looked up to him.

1410
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:41,090
He was still writing for comics that 
might've had some power at at best.

1411
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:46,170
I think it was a power thing.
If you're a man and you have your alone 

1412
01:07:46,511 --> 01:07:49,630
in a room with a woman,
and this is my perception of it.

1413
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:53,440
It's always a power thing because it's 
fucking weird because you can kill them.

1414
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:59,010
It's different.
Like have you ever been around like a 

1415
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:00,760
UFC athletes on big giant?
This was a place where you go,

1416
01:08:00,761 --> 01:08:02,590
if you,
if this was a tinder date,

1417
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:06,490
this happened in a place where you'd go,
I want to meet you in public,

1418
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:08,080
so don't want to be.
So yeah,

1419
01:08:08,081 --> 01:08:10,510
it was completely safe.
Yeah,

1420
01:08:10,511 --> 01:08:15,511
but if.
But if you're alone in a room with a 

1421
01:08:15,511 --> 01:08:15,511
man,
it's like being an,

1422
01:08:15,511 --> 01:08:15,980
you know that a

1423
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,820
man has some sexual urges directed 
towards you and you're a woman.

1424
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:24,880
It becomes a vulnerable situation and if
there's some weird shit where someone.

1425
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:31,240
If let's say someone was blocking the 
door because I had heard that Louis 

1426
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,270
didn't block any doors,
then it becomes really crazy.

1427
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,620
Like what do you do?
Well,

1428
01:08:33,621 --> 01:08:35,210
first of all,
you're hearing.

1429
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,730
Yes.
Yeah.

1430
01:08:37,731 --> 01:08:42,731
Well it's also like I think the thing 
that people have the hardest time with 

1431
01:08:42,731 --> 01:08:47,231
all of this is you never want to think 
that it's possible that someone would do

1432
01:08:49,851 --> 01:08:52,520
something horrible to somebody if you 
like them.

1433
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:55,160
Right?
Like with all of this,

1434
01:08:55,161 --> 01:09:00,161
with any of the,
whether it's Kevin Spacey or any of 

1435
01:09:00,161 --> 01:09:00,161
these people,
like maybe you liked him as an actor.

1436
01:09:00,161 --> 01:09:01,130
I like that guy.
He's great on house of cards.

1437
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:06,340
Wait a minute,
is you really just terrorizing people 

1438
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:06,340
and grabbing dicks everywhere?
Shit.

1439
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:08,210
Yeah.
I keep people around time.

1440
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,380
I do too.
I do too.

1441
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:11,810
I still grab ass and Dick's.
Oh,

1442
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,230
that's not what I do,
but no,

1443
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,990
I think about it that way at my house 
when.

1444
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:16,760
Oh,
when you guys.

1445
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,680
We had a party the other night.
I go,

1446
01:09:18,681 --> 01:09:22,320
who have I not got groped in 
appropriately.

1447
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:23,300
Okay.
Wait,

1448
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:28,480
Gill,
I haven't done it to you and I grabbed 

1449
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:28,480
his dick just to make sure that we're 
all fucking good.

1450
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:29,960
Never groped me.
I'm starting to feel a little left out.

1451
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:35,050
I don't think nothing.
I don't even think you've ever gotten 

1452
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:35,630
from my,
but I might've googled it from afar.

1453
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:39,110
I think you might have spanked me once,
but the point being it's like,

1454
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:44,160
come on,
we gotta just people have to figure out 

1455
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:47,591
some way to interface with each other 
100 percent of the time as equal and 

1456
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:50,490
just work on your own bullshit,
but when the way you talk to people,

1457
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:55,510
like somebody brought this up once that 
they initially with a lot of this stuff 

1458
01:09:55,510 --> 01:10:00,280
is that it's someone in the same 
business that's in this position of 

1459
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,410
being a great artist like Kevin Spacey 
type character or whatever,

1460
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:08,590
and then the other person is like a pa 
or something like that and he prays on 

1461
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:11,410
them and it's his show and they can't 
get away and he's like attacking them.

1462
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:13,270
They're straight and these gay.
Absolutely.

1463
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:18,080
I know that 100 percent.
I think that's some weird,

1464
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:23,081
almost like reptilian instinct that 
humans can't tell you how many times 

1465
01:10:23,931 --> 01:10:28,931
we've had to because you know my 
audience overserved quite a bit of the 

1466
01:10:29,301 --> 01:10:34,301
time and when it's a girl that's alone 
and you can see the packs of guys.

1467
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:36,480
Oh good.
Do.

1468
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:38,750
I'll give you a ride.
Where do you live?

1469
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:40,430
Exactly.
All right.

1470
01:10:40,431 --> 01:10:45,431
Let's get her an uber because I know 
that's going to go poorly and you know 

1471
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:47,990
it's fucked up about that.
Here's what's really fucked up.

1472
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:52,580
Not only was the woman the like the 
vulnerable one when it comes to like the

1473
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,140
possibility of violence,
right?

1474
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:59,410
She's also the vulnerable one when it 
comes to her reputation because like if 

1475
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:00,560
you and like chat.
Yeah,

1476
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:03,650
right.
If you and Bert Kreischer and five dudes

1477
01:11:03,651 --> 01:11:08,651
and a girl hops in the car with you and 
she decides to suck everybody off and 

1478
01:11:08,651 --> 01:11:10,850
then you tell the world and someone 
leaks her name and they're like,

1479
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:13,410
it hurts her,
but if you get up,

1480
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:14,340
if you're hitchhiking

1481
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:18,960
and you get picked up by six chicks who 
decided to below you and film it and put

1482
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:21,780
it on the Internet and you're cracking 
jokes and pitching your book,

1483
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:25,410
your book was chicken sucking your Dick.
You're a king.

1484
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:30,560
You're a Goddamn king that's worship you
because they'll throw up a red carpet 

1485
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,061
down in front of your van.
As you get out and bowed to you as you 

1486
01:11:35,061 --> 01:11:35,061
climb out,
send.

1487
01:11:35,061 --> 01:11:36,720
Another huge issue is how we treat 
women.

1488
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:40,760
Being able to guide their own sexuality,
a 100,

1489
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,800
that's a big part of what's going on in 
raise your daughters in a different way 

1490
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,461
than you raise your sons and that's why 
it's okay for a teacher to fuck a boy 

1491
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,460
kid.
Right?

1492
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:52,170
Exactly.
And it is.

1493
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:54,210
By the way,
we're won't even say a word.

1494
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:59,340
It should be treated the same.
You should raise your kids to know about

1495
01:11:59,341 --> 01:11:59,850
sex.

1496
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:01,790
You know what?
If you raised your daughters,

1497
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,920
it's a woman.
I should say this as long as it's a 

1498
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,051
woman.
If you raised your daughter with the 

1499
01:12:09,051 --> 01:12:11,181
same openness that you raise your son,
she'd know not to fuck a 35 year old 

1500
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:16,380
soccer coach when she's 15 because you 
were open.

1501
01:12:16,381 --> 01:12:18,480
You told her,
here's the pitfalls of life.

1502
01:12:18,481 --> 01:12:20,850
This is what it's about.
Guys are going to try to buck you.

1503
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:26,040
You don't.
You caught all women and I believe it's 

1504
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,300
as much a parenting problem as anything 
else.

1505
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:32,360
It really is fucking fascinating that 
you would have no problem if a really 

1506
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:36,231
hot teacher fucked your 16 year old son 
for really hot woman teacher like built 

1507
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:41,610
like Pamela Anderson back in the 
Baywatch days if somehow they teach it.

1508
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:42,220
No,
no,

1509
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,010
no.
Yeah,

1510
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,840
you should be a little more 
discriminating.

1511
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:49,230
But if it was a hot one,
you have no problem with it.

1512
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:53,040
Some Pamela Anderson,
like Gao is having sex with your 17 year

1513
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:56,070
old boy and he's got a six pack.
Yeah,

1514
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:58,540
fuck.
You have Tommy who were a winner.

1515
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:03,030
But if you reverse the genders,
it's a horrific offense.

1516
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:07,800
Like some handsome man has reduced your 
beautiful little daughter who's only 17.

1517
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:09,720
Fuck.
That guy needs to be in a cage.

1518
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,230
Appeared that,
that alone is like,

1519
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:18,231
this is where I can't extend the 
argument because I've never been a 

1520
01:13:18,231 --> 01:13:19,050
woman.
That's true.

1521
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:21,630
Uh,
and that's why I've been meaning to talk

1522
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:25,200
to you about saving a lot of this for a 
while.

1523
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:30,201
I have hosts can a comeback.
Do you remember when we were going to 

1524
01:13:30,201 --> 01:13:30,201
get married?
Yeah.

1525
01:13:30,201 --> 01:13:32,490
That was the last call I'm going to get 
married.

1526
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,140
I don't know if that's in the book or 
not.

1527
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:38,600
The last call I made when we knew the 
man show is going to get canceled.

1528
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:41,010
They wouldn't.
That might be in the book.

1529
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:42,000
I think it is.
They,

1530
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:44,130
uh,
the last call I made,

1531
01:13:44,131 --> 01:13:47,730
they wouldn't tell us it's canceled.
They leave you hanging on the vine.

1532
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:48,590
But,
uh,

1533
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:53,660
I was at the Atlanta punchline and I 
remember being in the parking lot and 

1534
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:56,580
Massachusetts had just passed gay 
marriage or civil unions,

1535
01:13:56,870 --> 01:14:00,360
or maybe you called me up.
I called Zoe Friedman first.

1536
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:03,720
Zoe Friedman was called Zoiah before he 
checked on me.

1537
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:09,360
Maybe I called you first,
but she's the one that counted because 

1538
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:09,450
she was our goto person at comedy 
central.

1539
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,410
And I said,
listen,

1540
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:11,710
before you us,

1541
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:17,010
give us one last episode where Jo and I 
get gay married and it just goes into 

1542
01:14:17,861 --> 01:14:22,861
this montage,
but it's the opposite of every marriage 

1543
01:14:22,861 --> 01:14:26,170
cliche where we're fishing together and 
no one's arguing,

1544
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:29,760
no one's fighting over the remote.
We're all happy.

1545
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:34,890
We're both happy to be watching the same
thing and it's just a perfect life 

1546
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:34,890
together

1547
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:36,200
to imagine that people decided to do 
that.

1548
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:39,140
Imagine if they had best friends,
get married as best friends,

1549
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:41,540
like it's nothing sexual in the 
contract.

1550
01:14:41,541 --> 01:14:44,330
Zero sexual obligation.
It's not sex.

1551
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,480
It's like you are getting married as 
best friends like for real than Bros 

1552
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,220
before hoes.
Just stop and think about how many,

1553
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:55,460
not obviously not the current 
relationships we're involved in.

1554
01:14:55,461 --> 01:15:00,461
We would never go so far,
but if you go back to like your 

1555
01:15:00,461 --> 01:15:02,861
twenties,
just imagine being stuck with some gap 

1556
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:03,680
when you're both God damn wreck,
right?

1557
01:15:03,681 --> 01:15:06,260
You're both crazy.
You're both 21 or whatever the fuck you.

1558
01:15:06,261 --> 01:15:08,090
Are.
You both completely out of your mind.

1559
01:15:08,091 --> 01:15:09,710
You're basically babies alone in the 
world.

1560
01:15:09,711 --> 01:15:11,150
You don't know what the fuck you're 
doing.

1561
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:16,690
Imagine living with that Gal for the 
rest of your life versus your friend 

1562
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:20,351
from back then.
I'm still friends with my buddies from 

1563
01:15:20,351 --> 01:15:20,510
when I was 21,
Jimmy lawless.

1564
01:15:20,511 --> 01:15:25,511
I talked to that dude all the time.
We text each other back and forth all 

1565
01:15:25,511 --> 01:15:28,451
the time.
I've been friends with him since I was 

1566
01:15:28,451 --> 01:15:28,451
15 or 14.
I might've been 14 when I met him.

1567
01:15:28,451 --> 01:15:29,310
I don't know.
Doug.

1568
01:15:29,311 --> 01:15:31,620
I hate your cigarette smoke during the 
podcast.

1569
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,210
A.
Okay.

1570
01:15:33,211 --> 01:15:35,310
I'll put in a a air purifier

1571
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,670
and that's the beef.
That's our marriage beef.

1572
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,020
This is our meat.
This is something I really did.

1573
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:44,160
I call it the dice clay option because 
die every time diocese here,

1574
01:15:44,161 --> 01:15:47,470
he chain smokes more than you and dice 
just hammers.

1575
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:52,630
We got an air cleaner that we would sit 
right behind him and turn that thing on 

1576
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:56,721
just to suck out the cigarette smoke 
because it's either that the air 

1577
01:15:57,181 --> 01:16:02,181
purifiers belching sewage by the second 
hour is just brown tar.

1578
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:07,280
Well,
he's the guy that to this day I still 

1579
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,141
fan boy in front of.
I can't believe I'm friends with dice 

1580
01:16:09,141 --> 01:16:09,141
clay like a really can't.
Every time I see him I'm like,

1581
01:16:09,141 --> 01:16:11,280
he's up to feel like you're friends with
them.

1582
01:16:11,281 --> 01:16:14,010
Like I've.
I've only met him a few times,

1583
01:16:14,011 --> 01:16:16,010
but I never saw like a human side to 
him.

1584
01:16:16,011 --> 01:16:19,410
He's always been anthony.
He's in character.

1585
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,260
You can get there with them.
I don't want to,

1586
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:24,030
I don't want to see him like that.
He's a good guy,

1587
01:16:24,031 --> 01:16:29,031
man.
I don't want to see the emperor with no 

1588
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:29,031
clothes.
His clothes are still on.

1589
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:29,540
I'm telling you.
It's all right.

1590
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:32,550
He's just a guy that's like,
you know,

1591
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,000
dice clay was gigantic and he got hit 
with the first wave of comedy haters.

1592
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:42,960
Like people don't remember what I was 
19.

1593
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:48,110
It was me and my girlfriend Marta,
and we were parked out in front of my 

1594
01:16:48,631 --> 01:16:53,631
house and we were listening to a dice 
clay cassette in my car and we were 

1595
01:16:54,991 --> 01:16:57,420
fucking crying.
I mean,

1596
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,640
tears are coming down my face.
I was 19,

1597
01:16:59,641 --> 01:17:01,340
I think she was 19 too.
We were both like,

1598
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:01,410
yeah.

1599
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:03,070
Ah,
ah,

1600
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:04,190
ah.
Never

1601
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:07,790
even considered doing standup at this 
point just so I was dying laughing.

1602
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:11,060
He's the reason I got into Stanford.
He was a monster.

1603
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:16,210
He was a monster.
And he was telling Rena he was coming 

1604
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:19,400
off the whole wave of Paul Riser.
Yes.

1605
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:21,080
Yes.
There was no backlash.

1606
01:17:21,081 --> 01:17:22,640
Yes.
We already noticed.

1607
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:24,090
Thanks Jennifer.
Notice rather,

1608
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:29,240
fuck you.
Paul Riser is amazing on stranger 

1609
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:29,240
things.
Uh,

1610
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,460
he's amazing.
You should fucking kids.

1611
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,390
Demagogue.
Oregon's what?

1612
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:37,050
Exactly.
Don't know.

1613
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,760
You have no demagogue and knowledge on 
the fucker talking out your ass.

1614
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:43,100
I tried,
I want to say about stranger things.

1615
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:46,010
I watched five minutes of the first one 
and I'm like,

1616
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:49,360
I can't watch kids and fuck it.
It looked like that.

1617
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:51,080
It gets better.
It gets so good.

1618
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:55,890
It's such a good show.
How dare you try to fail.

1619
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:56,540
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna.

1620
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,570
I'm gonna.
Hey,

1621
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:00,020
can you see,
I hate to use my,

1622
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,210
a scotsman as a,
a errand boy.

1623
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,050
Is there a coke in there?
Tried to find them.

1624
01:18:05,051 --> 01:18:06,050
I'm not.
I don't think so.

1625
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:10,430
There's some,
there might be a.

1626
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:12,910
nevermind Kansas Divia go in there,
motherfucker.

1627
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,780
Come on.
It sounds like it's gone.

1628
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:16,370
Fucking something in it.
No,

1629
01:18:16,371 --> 01:18:17,240
it's okay.
Brian,

1630
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,180
he left.
Sorry.

1631
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:24,430
I think there's like one can as eva.
He [inaudible] it sounds like it has 

1632
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:24,750
stevia.
Yay.

1633
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,090
Fuck that.
No Way.

1634
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:28,050
Can we,
um,

1635
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:31,410
the first cans of coke?
I just assumed.

1636
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:37,360
No,
I brought whiskey because I assumed he 

1637
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:37,360
wouldn't have club soda.
So,

1638
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:41,530
uh,
I thought if I'm going to have a vodka 

1639
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:41,530
drink,
I'll just drink mimosas.

1640
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:42,110
I'm fine.
That's a good move.

1641
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,820
We can have some God for me.
Oh No,

1642
01:18:43,821 --> 01:18:44,780
I don't need.
I know.

1643
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:49,790
I just assumed everyone has tried to 
work our way through this whole 

1644
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:52,190
experience here at this new spot.
We're not totally locked into place.

1645
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:56,360
If you want some unhealthy options,
I'll have some gluten heavy pasta.

1646
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:58,420
I have plenty of.

1647
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,270
I was going to change up.
I'm not going to you.

1648
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:04,460
Here's what we'll do next time you come 
here.

1649
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:09,990
I will have my nonexistent assistant 
send you an email with like a,

1650
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,830
a ride.
You don't want to run like a writer,

1651
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:13,790
like white m's.
No,

1652
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:14,110
no,
no.

1653
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:14,790
It's good.
Stevia.

1654
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,320
Stevia is a good dude.
They're good and Italian.

1655
01:19:17,321 --> 01:19:18,980
You just give it a chance.
So it's awful.

1656
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:19,550
No,
no.

1657
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:21,680
Sugar is fake.
Show that it's not.

1658
01:19:21,681 --> 01:19:24,790
It's a plan already.
Son of a coach.

1659
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:27,950
Bingo takes the Stevia all the fucking 
time.

1660
01:19:27,951 --> 01:19:29,660
But these sodas are good,
man.

1661
01:19:29,661 --> 01:19:34,661
I'm telling you,
they're really good and they're not 

1662
01:19:34,661 --> 01:19:36,441
going to kill your sugar.
Leaves such a bad taste in your mouth 

1663
01:19:36,441 --> 01:19:39,290
and I can't taste anything after 35 
years of smoking plant extracts.

1664
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:42,890
It's a sweet thing that doesn't Jack up 
your glycemic index.

1665
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,660
It's good for you,
Bro.

1666
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,990
Send me to stay alive.
Hannegan that you sent me.

1667
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:53,110
Just so you can talk about me.
Not One handling has been dealing with 

1668
01:19:54,411 --> 01:19:59,411
subterfuge.
It's no fun talking behind your back 

1669
01:19:59,411 --> 01:20:00,320
when we can do it to your face.
Hennigan,

1670
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:02,780
enjoy.
He's one of the things I enjoy about you

1671
01:20:02,781 --> 01:20:05,390
is you are very self deprecating fellow 
who is.

1672
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:08,450
You are.
You could take a good jab.

1673
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,660
Yeah.
And you give one back.

1674
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,250
Yes.
Cheers to that.

1675
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:12,810
Thank you.
Is that a Scottish thing?

1676
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:15,090
Seemed it seemed a little bit more fun 
over there.

1677
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:20,190
I would say the sculpt so good at being 
self deprecating and calling.

1678
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:21,270
I couldn't come.
Yeah.

1679
01:20:21,271 --> 01:20:22,830
And your billy connolly.
Yeah.

1680
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:25,350
He was like the main guy over there as 
far as standup and he.

1681
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:27,360
That was his whole thing.
He embodied that.

1682
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:29,280
Yeah,
just happy dude.

1683
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,140
Thing is a big thing in Scottish 
society,

1684
01:20:31,141 --> 01:20:36,141
which means one of the few good things 
I'll save her scholarship society is 

1685
01:20:36,141 --> 01:20:38,190
it's kind of egalitarian and we enjoy 
knocking.

1686
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:41,010
People don't who think they're better 
than other people,

1687
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:44,150
including yourself.
Australians do that shit too.

1688
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,160
They call it the tall poppy syndrome and
Japan.

1689
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,480
Yeah,
I think it's good,

1690
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:49,590
man.
Good.

1691
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:51,480
You know what I mean?
I think that's one of the things.

1692
01:20:51,481 --> 01:20:56,481
We're also going to always be 100 
percent and it goes back to your thing 

1693
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:59,460
about punching up.
Not yet occasionally,

1694
01:20:59,461 --> 01:21:00,920
because here's the thing about this 
whole punching up,

1695
01:21:00,921 --> 01:21:04,320
punching down thing.
I always bring up Sam Kennison bit about

1696
01:21:04,321 --> 01:21:06,090
the Ethiopian kids that were starving to
death.

1697
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:11,120
It's one of the fucking greatest all 
time bits and it's all hundred percent 

1698
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:11,120
punching down.
He's got to,

1699
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:16,420
in my opinion,
I mean if you have a list of the 

1700
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:18,351
greatest of all time bits to have them 
in my mind or Sam Kennison and one of 

1701
01:21:18,351 --> 01:21:19,190
them was the Ethiopian kids was like,
you know,

1702
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,000
you're sitting at home,
you got a dinner,

1703
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,230
you made it out yourself.

1704
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:24,470
You know,
you're sitting in front of the TV,

1705
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:29,480
feel good about life and all of a sudden
this fucking kid is starving kid and 

1706
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:35,540
there's a guy right next to them like,
could you please just give a couple 

1707
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:36,610
dollars a month?
So this guy goes,

1708
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,380
hey,
and you're like,

1709
01:21:37,381 --> 01:21:38,610
hey,
why don't.

1710
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:40,680
Why don't you feed them?
You're right next to them.

1711
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:46,260
I think it was.
I all I remember from that bit is send a

1712
01:21:46,261 --> 01:21:47,430
moving trucks.
You.

1713
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,370
The way the food is.
Yeah.

1714
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:54,730
Yeah.
He goes deserts in America to which it 

1715
01:21:55,471 --> 01:21:59,940
was chaos because it was the most 
punching down bit of all time.

1716
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:04,350
Starving children in Ethiopia.
I don't think that's punching.

1717
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:10,480
Punching at the people that are selling 
you this as you're grabbing the little 

1718
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:12,510
Ethiopian by,
Hey,

1719
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,620
come here,
come here motherfucker.

1720
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:17,040
Collateral damage.
Going to 100 years now.

1721
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:22,220
Fucking punching down.
I was talking about specifically twitter

1722
01:22:23,251 --> 01:22:28,251
fights were like Christine Levine,
who's at a Mammo,

1723
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:29,820
she's a friend of mine.

1724
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,600
She opens for me quite as her name Malmo
is that.

1725
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:35,430
That was her nickname when I met her 
online.

1726
01:22:35,431 --> 01:22:40,350
I know so many people based on their 
twitter name phase back in the day,

1727
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:44,800
well before that were a Icq.
What does that.

1728
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:45,930
She.
She's a,

1729
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:49,520
she's a,
what does that fucking text Iq?

1730
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:51,450
I remember that Shit.
I was,

1731
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:56,160
I was doing the dot comedy dot standup.
Didn't find the ICQ,

1732
01:22:56,190 --> 01:23:01,190
but uh,
there's something freeing about being 

1733
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:03,411
able to talk to someone.
You don't know what the fuck they look 

1734
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:05,331
like.
They don't know what the fuck you look 

1735
01:23:05,331 --> 01:23:07,071
like.
You can just chat with each other 

1736
01:23:07,071 --> 01:23:07,071
online.
Something freeing about that.

1737
01:23:07,071 --> 01:23:07,071
Yeah.

1738
01:23:07,071 --> 01:23:07,270
You know,
you like,

1739
01:23:07,271 --> 01:23:10,570
you get to know people just for the 
information.

1740
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:15,890
I just know that you're annoying.
It has nothing to do with your 

1741
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:15,890
sexuality,
your race,

1742
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:20,331
your religion.
I just know you're annoying as a human 

1743
01:23:20,331 --> 01:23:21,150
being and you realized that I judged you
for no other reason than you.

1744
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:25,440
And some people will trickier,
but some people,

1745
01:23:25,441 --> 01:23:29,940
you meet them online and they turn out 
to be the exact same thing when you meet

1746
01:23:29,941 --> 01:23:31,260
her in person and they're really cool.

1747
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:36,610
I've met some of the funniest people,
Funny Online,

1748
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:41,611
funny that when you meet them,
biggest social retards that they can't 

1749
01:23:43,841 --> 01:23:48,841
have or can't make eye contact,
can't deliver the law if they're on the 

1750
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:51,520
keyboard.
They're the funniest person.

1751
01:23:51,521 --> 01:23:55,480
They just have no social skills.
They can't present themselves.

1752
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:57,310
Right.
This guy is funnier than me.

1753
01:23:57,650 --> 01:23:59,560
Await in real life.
No,

1754
01:23:59,561 --> 01:24:01,570
he's not.
He could never do what we do,

1755
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,380
but he could write from a in a dark 
room.

1756
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:06,180
This is chick

1757
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:10,920
that is unbelievably hilarious on 
twitter and I found a recently.

1758
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,510
What is it?
Nacho.

1759
01:24:12,511 --> 01:24:13,880
Sarah.
What is,

1760
01:24:13,881 --> 01:24:15,580
what is?
Yes,

1761
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:17,110
what is that,
Jill?

1762
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:20,730
Sarah.
But I think that's her twitter handle.

1763
01:24:20,731 --> 01:24:22,860
Dude.
She's fucking hilarious.

1764
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,380
Like I'll go to her like every two,
three days.

1765
01:24:25,381 --> 01:24:30,381
I'll just go and check her twitter page 
just to see what ridiculous shit she 

1766
01:24:30,381 --> 01:24:31,500
posts.
She's really fucking funny and I'm like,

1767
01:24:31,501 --> 01:24:32,820
are you a standup?
Like.

1768
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:33,550
And she's like,
well,

1769
01:24:33,551 --> 01:24:34,930
I tried to wants,
but you know,

1770
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:38,120
you know who I because are right.
They're not.

1771
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:38,740
Joe.
Sarah

1772
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:42,320
said,
this is the same problem I have with my,

1773
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:45,920
uh,
twitter crush is Laura Duck.

1774
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:48,590
The one arm girl.
Okay.

1775
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:49,740
Yeah.
She,

1776
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:54,790
she made kind of national news,
twitter at national news because she put

1777
01:24:55,911 --> 01:24:58,370
on her tinder.
She's an arms dealer.

1778
01:24:58,371 --> 01:25:03,371
She had just lost her arm.
Laura or Lauren Duck,

1779
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:07,550
a duck fan is the twitter account duck 
fans up there?

1780
01:25:08,330 --> 01:25:09,860
Uh,
and she,

1781
01:25:09,861 --> 01:25:10,370
yeah,
she,

1782
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,810
she got her arm lopped off by a train 
and she posts also.

1783
01:25:14,811 --> 01:25:18,080
It's as somebody shit.
But she also posts really funny shit.

1784
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:21,200
And I said,
I wish when I come to San Diego that you

1785
01:25:21,201 --> 01:25:24,290
had a set because you're hot,
you have one arm,

1786
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:28,430
everything's already in your favor.
You're already naturally funny.

1787
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:34,880
Yeah.
There's some fucking funny people on 

1788
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,730
tour.
There's some funny people that work at 

1789
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:36,730
the post office.
They just don't get a chance to like the

1790
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:41,450
idea that we have figured out a way to 
monetize.

1791
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,060
The way we look at things is so 
offensive.

1792
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:47,270
It's so fast.
There's so many people in so many jobs,

1793
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:52,430
so they're just as funny as us.
They or maybe way more like my friend 

1794
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:55,931
Dave Dolan,
rest in peace who is one of my bosses 

1795
01:25:55,931 --> 01:25:56,080
back when I was first starting doing 
standup,

1796
01:25:56,240 --> 01:26:00,080
he was a private investigator.
Funniest person I've ever met in my life

1797
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:02,630
right next to Joe eps.
He's like right up there.

1798
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:03,020
He was.

1799
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,980
He was a private investigator and I 
worked for him because he got caught in 

1800
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:08,990
a Dui,
needed a driver,

1801
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:14,170
so he put an ad in a for an assistant 
for a private investigator and I was 

1802
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:15,890
looking for a day job while I was doing 
standup at nine.

1803
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:18,910
It was like perfect assistant for a 
private investigator,

1804
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:23,940
this God damn comic books and so I 
started working for this guy and he's 

1805
01:26:25,191 --> 01:26:29,480
this crazy Irish private investigator.
Wild Man.

1806
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:30,890
I mean,
he's a fucking wild man.

1807
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:34,520
He was so funny and he would just tell 
me stories about nutty,

1808
01:26:34,521 --> 01:26:37,850
shitty did and crazy fucking girls.
He knew and you know,

1809
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:41,390
just just.
I would be in my car crying,

1810
01:26:41,391 --> 01:26:43,900
laughing,
waiting for this person to come.

1811
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:48,940
We'd be at like 5:00
in the morning parked like doing like 

1812
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:51,760
surveillance on someone's house,
like waiting for them to leave their 

1813
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,611
house at 5:00
in the morning if someone's like doing 

1814
01:26:54,611 --> 01:26:54,611
like some sort of insecurity scam.

1815
01:26:54,611 --> 01:26:55,160
Mostly it was insurance and he would 
just.

1816
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:58,190
I would be crying and I was thinking I'm
trying to be a comic.

1817
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:03,640
This guys five,
six years older than me at least like 

1818
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:04,970
maybe nine years older than me.
I think I was 20 and was like 30.

1819
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:07,010
Is it an attorney?
The attorney,

1820
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:11,030
he was an animal.
I mean he was so fucking funny and I was

1821
01:27:11,031 --> 01:27:12,350
like,
I'll never be as funny as him.

1822
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:14,900
I just will never be as funny as him.
Like this is depressing.

1823
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:21,520
I loved working for the guy and I worked
for him for the entire six months that 

1824
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,090
he needed to have no license after he 
got arrested for a Dui.

1825
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:29,080
Stayed friends and I love that guy.
In the book I talk about Becker and 

1826
01:27:29,391 --> 01:27:34,391
Andy,
like two guys that are way funnier than 

1827
01:27:34,391 --> 01:27:37,571
me and a fuck them.
They never could put it together on 

1828
01:27:37,571 --> 01:27:37,571
stage.

1829
01:27:37,571 --> 01:27:41,060
I want to be as much as they say,
they're trying to be like you.

1830
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:42,970
I'm trying to be like them.
Right.

1831
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:45,200
You know those funny people,
you know?

1832
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:45,850
Yeah.
I want,

1833
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:49,310
I want to steal that essence because I 
know how to put it on stage.

1834
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:54,140
Never be naturally off the cuff as funny
as the funniest people I've met,

1835
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:57,380
but I can do it on stage and you can't,
so fuck you.

1836
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,690
Uh,
that's ruthless.

1837
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:02,460
I can,
I can boil down the organization.

1838
01:28:02,461 --> 01:28:05,960
There's some sort of writer 
correspondent he should have.

1839
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:10,990
You should have a policy that sexual 
harassment is mandatory and everybody 

1840
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:15,611
works inside the Doug Stan Hope.
Information Collection Organization like

1841
01:28:15,831 --> 01:28:19,070
anybody's trying to help you with the 
creation of your act idea gathering.

1842
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:23,660
What have you.
It was an unspoken each other until now.

1843
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:27,010
No,
it's kind of the thing and that's why we

1844
01:28:27,011 --> 01:28:31,730
were talking about the no one's meet 
doing rock and roll bands.

1845
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:36,970
Like they're not pulling led Zeppelin's 
library off of itunes because they 

1846
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:38,330
fucked,
fucked a girl with a fish.

1847
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:42,050
But here's my.
When you walk into the backstage area at

1848
01:28:42,051 --> 01:28:45,200
a rock'n'roll concert,
there's an unwritten rule.

1849
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:46,080
Yeah,
the,

1850
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:51,400
the,
the roadie tapped you on the shoulder 

1851
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:54,340
for a reason and you know what the 
reason is I was made to feel 

1852
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:58,571
uncomfortable.
He pulled out his dick out of sweaty 

1853
01:28:58,571 --> 01:29:00,200
leather pants after the show underwear.
No underwear.

1854
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:02,040
And then girls were bumps off

1855
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:02,910
of it.
No,

1856
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:07,940
they were gunners mostly because of the 
ball sweat a governors.

1857
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:13,850
I understand there's a difference 
between that and what happens with 

1858
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:16,230
fucking Harvey Weinstein.
That's a fucking rapist.

1859
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:17,370
Yes.
One hundred percent.

1860
01:29:17,371 --> 01:29:19,320
And here's the part,
part of the problem is that what we were

1861
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:24,321
talking about earlier,
that if you got in a car with seven 

1862
01:29:24,321 --> 01:29:24,321
women and they all fuck you,
you're a hero,

1863
01:29:24,321 --> 01:29:26,220
would have a gal gets in the car with 
seven.

1864
01:29:26,221 --> 01:29:29,430
Jason Mamoa was that uh,
the guy from the game of thrones,

1865
01:29:29,431 --> 01:29:32,280
that fucking beautiful handsome man,
that gigantic cancer man,

1866
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:37,910
he's so huge and so beautiful,
like have seven of those were in a car 

1867
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:39,010
and it was a gal and she was just like 
ravaged,

1868
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:42,720
ravaged,
and she's some sort of a damage thing.

1869
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:46,740
We know those,
we know those girls that celebrate that.

1870
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:47,550
No,
no.

1871
01:29:47,551 --> 01:29:49,440
We know the ones that are like,
yeah,

1872
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,150
I fucked that guy.

1873
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,380
I know a few.
Yeah,

1874
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,170
for sure.
That are just like,

1875
01:29:55,171 --> 01:30:00,171
dudes.
You shouldn't be like that for 

1876
01:30:00,171 --> 01:30:00,171
everybody.
It's a suppression issue.

1877
01:30:00,171 --> 01:30:00,690
It's the same reason why Catholics feel 
guilty.

1878
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:03,330
It's not a matter of why what's wrong or
what's right.

1879
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:08,570
It's a matter of what you enjoy and what
you don't enjoy it because other people 

1880
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:11,861
are going to judge you for it and then 
you've got to get to the root of why 

1881
01:30:11,861 --> 01:30:14,301
these people judging it for a giant 
percentage of the men that judge women 

1882
01:30:14,301 --> 01:30:15,270
for their sexual activity.
It's 100 percent out of jealousy,

1883
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:20,770
so 100 percent out of the idea that this
woman would not want to do that with 

1884
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:24,021
them and they cast a judgement on her 
and they decided that her needs are 

1885
01:30:24,021 --> 01:30:25,170
different than our than the demands 
needs,

1886
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:28,320
but the bottom line is all these things 
were established back when it was really

1887
01:30:28,321 --> 01:30:33,321
difficult to have children and you had 
to protect your children and most of 

1888
01:30:33,321 --> 01:30:34,530
them are going to die and you were 
literally concerned about the population

1889
01:30:34,531 --> 01:30:35,250
of your village.

1890
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:36,340
Well,
those instincts,

1891
01:30:36,650 --> 01:30:41,650
they still exist,
but the problem is that's not a concern 

1892
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:41,650
anymore and then this fucking birth 
control and whatever,

1893
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:41,820
19,
60,

1894
01:30:41,821 --> 01:30:42,990
whatever.
That chick came out.

1895
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:48,200
When did that come out?
When the chick start being superheroes 

1896
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:51,300
was a early seventies when roe versus 
Wade and control and all that.

1897
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:53,580
Yeah,
it should be even,

1898
01:30:53,670 --> 01:30:54,240
you know,
there's,

1899
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:59,320
there's gotta be some sort of a way to 
make it even easier than all this has 

1900
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:02,790
gotta be a way where you let the natural
hormones will think what has happened is

1901
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,580
60 and nailed it to nailed it.
I think it did.

1902
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:11,940
Nineteen 60.
I thought were going to make the 

1903
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:11,940
argument for bringing back villages.
Well,

1904
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:13,080
it's not a bad idea,
man.

1905
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,570
Here's the thing.
I think cities are amazing,

1906
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:20,600
but I don't think we're designed for it 
and I think we will be ready for it and 

1907
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,861
a couple hundred years it's going to 
take some sort of an adaptation to the 

1908
01:31:23,861 --> 01:31:25,230
human psyche and the way we interact 
with each other,

1909
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:28,620
but I think it's totally doable if 
people like us can do it.

1910
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:33,890
This is how I've always felt.
If the entire world was the four of us 

1911
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:34,860
in this room,
we will be fine.

1912
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:37,860
Like what if we were the only people 
with what if we were immortal?

1913
01:31:37,861 --> 01:31:40,950
We didn't have to worry about dying and 
it was just the four of us and it just a

1914
01:31:40,951 --> 01:31:45,951
bunch of food and shit to do.
Do you think we would have any problem 

1915
01:31:45,951 --> 01:31:45,951
at all?
Yeah,

1916
01:31:45,951 --> 01:31:46,800
we would miss the fact that we're in.
He checks.

1917
01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:50,340
That'd be kind of a bummer,
but we would probably have a good time.

1918
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:53,370
We just had unlimited resources,
Roman around,

1919
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:54,880
which we do.
Yeah.

1920
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:56,100
Well,
essentially the,

1921
01:31:56,101 --> 01:32:01,101
the,
the world like wildfire in Ventura 

1922
01:32:01,101 --> 01:32:01,101
spreads

1923
01:32:01,101 --> 01:32:04,030
across the world while this podcast goes
on and on,

1924
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,000
and then we walk out and you're like,
oh,

1925
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:09,580
fucking Zombie apocalypse without the 
zombies.

1926
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:14,830
The zombies kicking into that of ashes 
sent those on the grill.

1927
01:32:15,390 --> 01:32:20,390
They showed us how to use it could press
buttons and I'm going to have to drink 

1928
01:32:20,390 --> 01:32:20,390
stevia.
I'll,

1929
01:32:20,390 --> 01:32:22,300
I'll get irritated by that.
Just do me a favor.

1930
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:24,090
Give them a little.
No,

1931
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:24,580
no,
no,

1932
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:25,420
I've,
I've done it.

1933
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:28,440
You're racist.
Just try it.

1934
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:32,710
I don't know if it's hot in here,
but I'm actually sweating from the gears

1935
01:32:32,711 --> 01:32:36,160
and I thought it's because Joe Rogan's 
bellowing so much.

1936
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:38,340
I'm bleeding out of my earphones.
Sorry,

1937
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:43,440
but it's actually sweat.
I'm sweating on your earphones and 

1938
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,230
whoever sits here next.
I hope he's OCD because.

1939
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:48,310
Are you a just leapt up.
Fire it up.

1940
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,650
I'm trying to be too loud.
No,

1941
01:32:50,651 --> 01:32:51,910
no,
no one was giving me shit.

1942
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:56,970
I know.
I just never know when you're being 

1943
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:56,970
real.
No,

1944
01:32:56,970 --> 01:33:00,041
no.
I am sweating from my earphones and I 

1945
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:00,100
think that's gross that I'm sweating on 
your earphone so I had to say it.

1946
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:03,910
I don't give a fuck dude.
I don't give a fuck about period blood.

1947
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,470
I don't give a fuck about sweat.
That bothers me.

1948
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:11,020
I've never seen people do bother me 
because I am everything.

1949
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:15,670
I would assume that they find to be a 
problem.

1950
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:20,710
I'm filthy.
I think you should eat meat with 30 

1951
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:20,980
hands.
That's what I think.

1952
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:24,280
I think you should eat meat with dirty.
If I know someone's OCD,

1953
01:33:24,281 --> 01:33:27,820
I'm afraid to be around them.
I'm comfortable.

1954
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:31,660
I have a friend who went to look at a 
house and they were looking at the house

1955
01:33:31,661 --> 01:33:33,670
and as a nice house like wow,
this house beautiful.

1956
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:37,480
And then they got to this one closet and
the closet was filled with Purell,

1957
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:41,170
with hand sanitizer and they went,
fuck this.

1958
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:46,380
Like this house is haunted my friends.
That dude,

1959
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,810
the fucking thing was filled.
It was a closet.

1960
01:33:52,811 --> 01:33:56,230
It was filled from the floor all the way
to the top of pure route.

1961
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:59,590
They were like,
you knew stern and ONA.

1962
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,610
I don't know if both.
Oh,

1963
01:34:00,611 --> 01:34:05,611
and a one of them at least they were all
purell touching everything and if I get 

1964
01:34:06,731 --> 01:34:11,731
a cold and my,
my guttural smoker's cough is enough 

1965
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:17,260
that you're gonna not want me here.
I cough off Mike.

1966
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:20,260
I try to,
but I know he's going to hear it and go.

1967
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:24,010
Think about how many people you interact
with and shake hands with.

1968
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:26,920
I think the more people you share your 
biome with,

1969
01:34:26,921 --> 01:34:28,990
like Paul stamets,
the mushroom guy,

1970
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:34,000
you know,
he has some pretty famous mycologist 

1971
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:34,000
who's on my podcast really recently.
It's amazing stories,

1972
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,851
but one of the things that he said is 
like if you come in contact with 

1973
01:34:38,851 --> 01:34:41,371
someone,
their biome interacts with your biome 

1974
01:34:41,371 --> 01:34:41,371
and you,
there's a,

1975
01:34:41,371 --> 01:34:44,590
some sort of a residual amount of DNA 
that you're taking into your own biome.

1976
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,690
Like,
like if you meet somebody,

1977
01:34:46,691 --> 01:34:48,670
you become part of them and some very 
bizarre way.

1978
01:34:48,671 --> 01:34:49,540
I was like,
what?

1979
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:52,260
He's like intro,
introduce in like,

1980
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:53,670
you know,
welcome to my home,

1981
01:34:53,671 --> 01:34:54,940
and I was like,
this is crazy.

1982
01:34:55,570 --> 01:35:00,570
Welcome to my.
He's a scientist so he's not like just 

1983
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:03,210
bullshitting and he's not like some 
crazy dude who doesn't believe in birds.

1984
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:11,080
Go on it.
You told me something on a podcast years

1985
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:14,690
ago and it's one of those things that 
comes up late at night where I go,

1986
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:18,680
I want to call Rogan,
but I'm not going to call you at 1130 at

1987
01:35:18,681 --> 01:35:21,080
night.
And what was the thing that you said?

1988
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:23,660
Listen,
call me anytime you call me.

1989
01:35:23,661 --> 01:35:25,010
You want to call me,
call me please.

1990
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,990
I don't bother you.
You can see.

1991
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:30,350
Do you see love to use a quote from you 
on the back of this book?

1992
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:31,160
No,
no,

1993
01:35:31,161 --> 01:35:33,800
I called people that if they said no,
we're not friends.

1994
01:35:33,801 --> 01:35:36,230
Anyway,
Chris Rock said No.

1995
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:38,000
Well I don't know him.
Anyway,

1996
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:40,070
he's a nice guy.
I know he is.

1997
01:35:41,890 --> 01:35:45,160
He wrote me a better quote.
He then I would have.

1998
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:46,640
I would love to quote your book,
man.

1999
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,920
Don't ever asked me.
I mean don't ever worry about asking me.

2000
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:51,080
I don't want to put anyone on the spot.

2001
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,310
I'll put me on the spot.
I love you.

2002
01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:55,190
You,
you had one of my favorite people.

2003
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:58,580
If I have a top 20 people that survived 
and everybody dies,

2004
01:35:58,581 --> 01:36:02,230
you're in like if there was like some 
sort of an apocalypse though,

2005
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:06,600
we'll work on it with a side.
He gained like five of year free.

2006
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:09,740
So I got five of mind family,
whoever need to know this still alive.

2007
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:16,280
You told me something about over the 
course of I think 20 years,

2008
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:19,130
the amount of uh,
of cells.

2009
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,500
You're not even the same person you were
seven years.

2010
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:23,760
Tell it with your smart way of saying 
it.

2011
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:24,500
I'm,
by the way,

2012
01:36:24,501 --> 01:36:27,290
this is like third hand smart way 
because I'm clearly a retard,

2013
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:32,560
but if you go back to like seven years 
ago and then today you literally don't 

2014
01:36:32,811 --> 01:36:35,900
have the same cells in most of your 
body.

2015
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,900
The only thing that doesn't regenerate 
as the neurons,

2016
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:43,160
the neurons do not regenerate,
but every cell in your body is different

2017
01:36:43,161 --> 01:36:45,320
than the cells in your body from seven 
years ago.

2018
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,860
So what are your memories remain?
And this is part of the problem.

2019
01:36:48,861 --> 01:36:53,861
It's become you become a victim to the 
momentum of your past behavior and 

2020
01:36:53,861 --> 01:36:56,430
there's nothing you can do about it.
So if you're Kevin Spacey,

2021
01:36:56,450 --> 01:36:59,270
you decided six months ago,
I am not grabbing any more dicks.

2022
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:02,360
I'm fucking done with this.
I'm going to be a better person.

2023
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:07,010
Like you are attached the momentum of 
your past behavior.

2024
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:08,690
You know,
no matter what,

2025
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,090
even if you're not even that guy 
anymore,

2026
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,260
like seven years later,
you wake up,

2027
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:15,680
you wake up in the morning,
shit,

2028
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:17,920
what did I grab?
Grab some decks.

2029
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:19,040
Fuck,

2030
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,750
why did I do that?
Granted,

2031
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:25,060
God dammit.
Oh,

2032
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:26,460
I was so drunk.

2033
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:32,100
That's something you can do.
You're stuck with that idea like we 

2034
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:32,100
have,
we have to get past that.

2035
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,410
We have to figure out a way.
I think Pi,

2036
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,680
they have to take those electric things 
and fucking change your brain.

2037
01:37:37,681 --> 01:37:42,681
Like she like shock therapy and then 
we'll let you ride when you don't 

2038
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:47,970
account for growth and that.
This is my huge thing.

2039
01:37:47,971 --> 01:37:49,510
If I had a,
uh,

2040
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:54,590
a charity that I was behind,
if I was on dancing with the stars,

2041
01:37:54,811 --> 01:37:59,750
which think is going to be in those 
negotiations were going on in.

2042
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:00,600
Remember,
listen,

2043
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:06,830
don't you killed Doug Stanhope.
I had a fucking Dina since pot seen 

2044
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:07,530
before men.
Uneasy.

2045
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:11,520
He wants to die by the innocence 
project.

2046
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:12,210
Let me,
let me,

2047
01:38:12,211 --> 01:38:17,211
let me get this point out.
And then let's go back to dancing with 

2048
01:38:17,211 --> 01:38:18,120
Joe Innocence project.
That's my thing.

2049
01:38:18,121 --> 01:38:20,370
And uh,
I don't,

2050
01:38:20,371 --> 01:38:24,750
I've never been locked up when I was 
innocent.

2051
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,670
It's just,
it's my fear.

2052
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:30,750
And when you terrifying fear of the 
entire prison system,

2053
01:38:30,751 --> 01:38:35,130
the justice system,
the prison doesn't work whatsoever.

2054
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:40,130
And when you lock someone up at 18 years
old for some shit you,

2055
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:44,370
you,
you grow out of these things,

2056
01:38:44,371 --> 01:38:47,460
like you're not accepting that as you 
age,

2057
01:38:47,461 --> 01:38:50,060
you rethink things and you're,
it's full.

2058
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,160
It's totally ineffective way to reform 
people as well.

2059
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:58,460
Most prisons,
some prisons are trying to be more 

2060
01:38:58,460 --> 01:38:58,460
progressive with their scandinavia.
Iceland,

2061
01:38:58,470 --> 01:39:01,020
yes.
Mostly outside of America.

2062
01:39:01,021 --> 01:39:06,021
America has a real problem and one of 
the real problems is there's not all of 

2063
01:39:06,021 --> 01:39:06,280
it,
but a certain amount of the press.

2064
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:11,310
Yes.
For profit and these private prison 

2065
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:11,310
systems.
Anytime something's for profit,

2066
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:15,860
the system benefits from these laws 
being uniform or increasing in severity 

2067
01:39:18,061 --> 01:39:23,061
and like.
So if you have like a way where people 

2068
01:39:23,061 --> 01:39:25,971
can profit.
Like this was the issue that I had with 

2069
01:39:25,971 --> 01:39:25,971
marijuana.

2070
01:39:25,971 --> 01:39:29,390
Will you would find out that prison 
guard unions would be lobbying against 

2071
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:31,500
marijuana for jobs.
Yes.

2072
01:39:31,530 --> 01:39:36,530
I'm like,
police having done so well and what are 

2073
01:39:36,530 --> 01:39:38,840
we like our 45 now.
Not Stepping on my new bits because 

2074
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,950
that's all I have.
That kind of stuff.

2075
01:39:40,951 --> 01:39:42,870
But all of the things we're talking 
about.

2076
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:47,930
I was talking about Brian with Brian on 
the other day and we were talking about 

2077
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:47,930
something and he was like,
you know,

2078
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:48,930
I've been talking about this in my act 
and I'm like,

2079
01:39:48,931 --> 01:39:52,530
of course you have because this is like 
what's really relevant today and I think

2080
01:39:52,531 --> 01:39:57,531
that all of us have this weird thing 
like we don't want to step on each 

2081
01:39:57,531 --> 01:40:00,201
other's material and let of course 
you're going to see some of the same 

2082
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:01,350
things that I'm seeing and I want to see
your take on it as much as I want to see

2083
01:40:01,351 --> 01:40:02,000
my take on it.

2084
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:02,440
Oh,
I'm just,

2085
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:07,550
I'm trying not to do punch line as key 
to the discourse and not go into bit.

2086
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:10,980
I have to.
I know what you mean.

2087
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:12,570
Yeah,
it's those bits are good,

2088
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,370
but you don't want to give them up yet.
No,

2089
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:19,430
no,
and honestly this one bit that goes with

2090
01:40:19,591 --> 01:40:24,591
the entire rape thing.
I have been missing just one ceiling 

2091
01:40:24,661 --> 01:40:29,661
chunk of this bit that's sometimes goes 
25 minutes of too long and I just trying

2092
01:40:33,601 --> 01:40:38,601
to get the point across and all this 
current climate as I keep calling it has

2093
01:40:40,381 --> 01:40:45,330
me like that's what I was missing.
Now I have specific examples of this guy

2094
01:40:45,331 --> 01:40:50,331
versus this guy now it made the entire 
bit come together and now I'm off the 

2095
01:40:50,911 --> 01:40:55,911
road until March or like motherfucker.
Now I actually want to go out and do 

2096
01:40:56,321 --> 01:40:59,950
more dates just because this a year and 
a half I think I've been working on this

2097
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:02,800
bucket and one stupid bit that happens.

2098
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:06,250
You know Chris Rock said that he was 
working on that.

2099
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:10,110
I love black people.
I hate niggers and remember that.

2100
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:11,610
Fuck you.
Who says it?

2101
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:13,430
He wasn't white man doesn't.
It was.

2102
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:18,280
It is in my estimation,
one of the all time greatest,

2103
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:22,930
most significant standup comedy bits 
ever and when it hit,

2104
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:27,990
I remember I was just kind of starting 
out when that bit was like popular on 

2105
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:32,911
that bit was like on cds and people 
would play it back and you'd see it on 

2106
01:41:32,911 --> 01:41:32,911
television.
You'd be like,

2107
01:41:32,911 --> 01:41:33,730
I was like,
oh my God.

2108
01:41:33,731 --> 01:41:36,730
It's like a perfect bit.
Like he had it boiled down.

2109
01:41:36,731 --> 01:41:40,210
The punch lines were so succinct.
It was just Bam,

2110
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:41,230
Bam,
Bam.

2111
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:46,680
And then I read that he had bombed with 
that pit for months and months before he

2112
01:41:46,871 --> 01:41:50,910
figured out how to get it to work.
I got hate mail from fan.

2113
01:41:50,911 --> 01:41:53,260
It's not like agregious actually.

2114
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:55,000
Well thought out.
Hey,

2115
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:57,370
I saw you.
I agree with most of what you say,

2116
01:41:57,371 --> 01:41:59,740
but what you were saying,
are you saying?

2117
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:00,490
And I'm like,
no,

2118
01:42:00,491 --> 01:42:02,800
that's not what I'm saying.
That's what I'm trying to not say,

2119
01:42:02,801 --> 01:42:05,800
but yeah,
I'm having such a hard time alliterating

2120
01:42:05,801 --> 01:42:10,000
this and everything that's happened in 
the last month or two has,

2121
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:13,240
oh now I can exactly point out what I'm 
saying.

2122
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:17,110
And I actually have reverse engineered 
it where I go,

2123
01:42:17,111 --> 01:42:19,180
oh,
I shouldn't be starting from where I was

2124
01:42:19,181 --> 01:42:24,181
ending and then go the other way rather 
than apologizing and yeah.

2125
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:29,910
Yeah.
Well it's been boarded out right when I 

2126
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:30,610
get off the road fucking asshole.
But you'll,

2127
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:34,810
it doesn't matter.
It isn't an always kinda like fucking.

2128
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:40,300
It's,
it keeps going like it's done in a new 

2129
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:40,300
branch pops out of the tree and you're 
like,

2130
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:43,860
oh,
this is what's going to bear fruit for.

2131
01:42:44,010 --> 01:42:49,010
I was doing these shitty gigs for 
fucking months and every night I hated 

2132
01:42:49,010 --> 01:42:51,030
going onstage and now I want to go 
onstage,

2133
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:52,250
but I don't have a Gig.
Well,

2134
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:54,700
what I like,
what I've found pretty recently,

2135
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:59,760
like within the last year,
I mean is that that is all like some 

2136
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,091
shit that I internalize and then if I 
can just like it express or,

2137
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:05,860
or respond to that,
the least amount.

2138
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,990
Like all the weird shit.
I know it exists.

2139
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,120
I have a weird set.
It's too long.

2140
01:43:10,121 --> 01:43:12,700
It's too this too that I don't like it.
I know it exists.

2141
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,140
Don't,
don't freak out,

2142
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:18,130
but,
but understand what that is and then you

2143
01:43:18,131 --> 01:43:20,080
know what that is.
That's it didn't work.

2144
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:25,140
Now let's figure out how to fucking 
never let that happen again because 

2145
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:28,641
there's a big difference with the swing 
between like the audience having a 

2146
01:43:28,641 --> 01:43:31,351
fucking amazing time or it was really 
good for 45 minutes that suck for 10 

2147
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:32,740
like shit.

2148
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:37,770
There is no better learning experience 
that happens for decades than eating 

2149
01:43:40,691 --> 01:43:42,430
shit.
Nothing will ever make you know,

2150
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:46,120
come back stronger than actually dying 
on your ass.

2151
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:51,630
But I'd rather be mediocre.
But even mediocre like eating shit dude,

2152
01:43:53,781 --> 01:43:58,781
I ain't shit after Jim Brewer in some 
weird suburb outside of the city in New 

2153
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,080
York.
I shit so hard.

2154
01:44:03,081 --> 01:44:05,780
It changed my life.
Probably not recently.

2155
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:11,200
No.
It was like 93,

2156
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:15,920
maybe [inaudible] 93 and brewer and our 
just start now and I was fine.

2157
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:17,780
Like I really shouldn't have been 
headlining.

2158
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,190
There's no way I should have been 
headline.

2159
01:44:19,191 --> 01:44:24,191
I had maybe 45 minutes that was mediocre
at best and brewer and I had a great 

2160
01:44:25,071 --> 01:44:30,071
time all weekend.
Friday two shows everything worked out 

2161
01:44:30,071 --> 01:44:31,040
great.
But although if I'm being honest,

2162
01:44:31,041 --> 01:44:35,510
I want to say that he had better sets,
at least two of the three shows.

2163
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:37,370
At least two of the three shows he had 
better sets,

2164
01:44:37,371 --> 01:44:39,680
but I had good sets.
It wasn't embarrassing.

2165
01:44:40,010 --> 01:44:44,840
And then the second show,
Saturday night he made me eat a bus load

2166
01:44:44,841 --> 01:44:49,841
of shit.
I bombed like the one of the wars 

2167
01:44:49,841 --> 01:44:53,231
bombings ever of my career ever where it
was like everything that came out of my 

2168
01:44:54,201 --> 01:44:58,160
mouth was a Dr.
brick and he destroyed in front of me.

2169
01:44:58,161 --> 01:44:59,290
I mean,
destroyed the program.

2170
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,840
Like fucking crumbs.
We're breaking up off of the fucking low

2171
01:45:02,841 --> 01:45:05,270
hanging ceiling.
You know that it was,

2172
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:07,030
you know,
those pipes.

2173
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:08,910
Actually I think I,
that's I,

2174
01:45:08,911 --> 01:45:11,890
I think I coined that.
It was a like a brick.

2175
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:16,270
The words came out of my mouth like a 
brick through a funnel.

2176
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:21,130
It feels like you have a mouthful of 
dirt.

2177
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:29,060
The one I talked to the following and I 
where I can blame the middle.

2178
01:45:29,681 --> 01:45:32,030
Act.
Like sometimes they just don't like you.

2179
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:34,360
The middle I can take credit,
but no,

2180
01:45:34,510 --> 01:45:39,510
they just hated you.
The one I couldn't follow for a week in 

2181
01:45:39,510 --> 01:45:42,310
Miami was Chris Porter,
Chris Porter.

2182
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:44,290
Chris border.
You know Chris Porter?

2183
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,430
Yeah.
Fucking stoner.

2184
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:50,080
Fucking thin curly hair.
He's very funny.

2185
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:55,710
But we're Miami Improv at the time.
This was probably 2000 and it was a,

2186
01:45:56,070 --> 01:46:00,310
an urban room black.
Well No,

2187
01:46:00,311 --> 01:46:02,080
no,
because there was a lot of Cuban too.

2188
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:03,910
So,
but yeah,

2189
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:06,040
maybe five white people that are scared.

2190
01:46:06,070 --> 01:46:07,590
Sammy Sosa,
Cuban,

2191
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,750
1993 or Sammy Sosa,
Cuban,

2192
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:11,680
2017.

2193
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:13,810
Miami,
Miami,

2194
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:15,700
Fort Lauderdale,
dark.

2195
01:46:15,730 --> 01:46:20,710
Not West Palm.
My girls have lived first night I,

2196
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:24,020
I assumed I am getting fired.
So I just go crazy.

2197
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:24,750
Took on.
No,

2198
01:46:24,751 --> 01:46:25,140
no,
no.

2199
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:29,920
I went there throwing fucking empty 
cigarette packs at me on stage following

2200
01:46:29,921 --> 01:46:33,850
Chris Porter who knew all the fucking 
recent hip hoppy things.

2201
01:46:33,851 --> 01:46:38,851
He had all the current urban trends in 
Zack did he fucking destroyed and I'm up

2202
01:46:39,911 --> 01:46:44,911
there like kind of knew with my anti 
authoritarian kind of point of view and 

2203
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:48,470
fuck,
vice cops have this fuck Nash.

2204
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:52,110
And he closed.
It was right after.

2205
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:55,170
This'll probably dated when it,
cause he was,

2206
01:46:55,310 --> 01:46:58,890
it was when France wouldn't let us fly 
over their airspace.

2207
01:46:59,770 --> 01:47:02,220
Yeah.
If we say this point,

2208
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:07,250
that's the point.
Being years later I got one of my best 

2209
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:11,931
bits ever about nationalism out of that 
because he closed on fuck France if we 

2210
01:47:12,181 --> 01:47:15,000
had an to save their ass in two world 
wars.

2211
01:47:15,570 --> 01:47:20,570
And I turned that eventually in new one 
of my best bits ever because I would go 

2212
01:47:21,571 --> 01:47:23,850
up and I'd follow him going,
yes,

2213
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:25,260
that's right.
Chris bought there.

2214
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:27,720
That was the French coding you.
Yeah.

2215
01:47:27,721 --> 01:47:29,200
As Chris bought there,
they're not.

2216
01:47:29,210 --> 01:47:31,350
These are not door.
Please help us.

2217
01:47:31,351 --> 01:47:36,351
You.
And it turned into that bid I did about 

2218
01:47:36,351 --> 01:47:39,040
nationalism.
Where if we hadn't saved the French was 

2219
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:42,861
at us,
was at us guaranteeing routes in the 

2220
01:47:42,861 --> 01:47:44,010
trenches and Verdun was that you 
wouldn't be.

2221
01:47:44,011 --> 01:47:48,540
I remember last night we were hammered.
I don't remember saving the French.

2222
01:47:48,690 --> 01:47:52,290
I remember we went through the drive 
through without a car.

2223
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:55,980
We did a lot of things,
but we didn't save the French.

2224
01:47:55,981 --> 01:48:00,981
You're talking about other people that 
did shit and you're taking credit for 

2225
01:48:00,981 --> 01:48:04,971
it.
Nationalism does nothing but teach you 

2226
01:48:04,971 --> 01:48:05,070
how to take credit for other people's 
accomplishments.

2227
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:07,290
But the same can be said for rooting for
the raiders,

2228
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:07,800
right?

2229
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:10,140
Yeah,
sure.

2230
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:11,910
Fucking warm boom.
Right?

2231
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:17,140
Yeah.
It's a very bizarre thing that we love 

2232
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:18,330
to do and I think it's all connected to 
the.

2233
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:22,970
Why does home field advantage work?
My fucking best idea.

2234
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:25,860
Affable so uncomfortable in that arena 
for all those other people.

2235
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:30,890
It's my best idea that no Billy Ball 
kind of people in the professional 

2236
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:35,721
sports leagues are picking up on field a
team of sociopath's because homefield 

2237
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:38,850
advantage is one of the biggest things 
in sports.

2238
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:42,720
Home field advantage.
If you feel the team of sociopath's that

2239
01:48:42,721 --> 01:48:45,810
don't care about cheers or booze,
yeah,

2240
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:49,440
there's no home field advantage anymore 
because these are psychopaths that don't

2241
01:48:49,441 --> 01:48:51,750
care about cheers.
They just want to win and kill.

2242
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:54,000
All right?
That's not sustainable.

2243
01:48:54,001 --> 01:48:55,800
You've got to shoot them after a couple 
of years,

2244
01:48:55,950 --> 01:48:57,910
as soon as they start wearing diamonds 
in their watches,

2245
01:48:57,920 --> 01:48:59,850
you got to shoot them in the locker room
like what happened?

2246
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:01,680
What happened?
How did he die?

2247
01:49:02,150 --> 01:49:02,730
Like W,
W,

2248
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:03,920
w,
Aaron Hernandez,

2249
01:49:03,921 --> 01:49:08,921
that guy was a tinder.
May Be eliminating the home team 

2250
01:49:08,921 --> 01:49:12,191
advantage for NBA players hating on it.
The black man is tinder.

2251
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:19,381
I want you to consider the fact that a 
giant percentage of NBA players are 

2252
01:49:19,381 --> 01:49:21,730
people of color.
You racist fucks.

2253
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:26,880
They're swooping into these white towns 
and banging all these white chicks and 

2254
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:31,240
you got a problem tender home field 
advantage to make it easier for them.

2255
01:49:31,241 --> 01:49:32,470
They don't have to go do work.
They just.

2256
01:49:32,471 --> 01:49:33,290
I'm sorry.
I sorry,

2257
01:49:33,410 --> 01:49:33,790
what?
I say,

2258
01:49:33,791 --> 01:49:35,980
come to the hotel instead of having to 
go into tinder.

2259
01:49:35,981 --> 01:49:36,760
Tinder.
Tinder.

2260
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:39,220
I'm sorry.
I was just doing that for comedy.

2261
01:49:39,450 --> 01:49:44,450
Oh my God.
If I was still a sexual being man as a 

2262
01:49:45,111 --> 01:49:47,950
sexual being,
that's a Bernie Mac and

2263
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:51,370
bad Santa Bernie Mac.
Mac will be hilarious.

2264
01:49:51,371 --> 01:49:53,350
Standup.
You ever see Bernie Mac live?

2265
01:49:54,530 --> 01:49:56,020
Mm.
No.

2266
01:49:56,200 --> 01:50:01,200
I saw Bernie Mac live at the comedy 
connection in Boston once and I was 

2267
01:50:01,601 --> 01:50:03,370
like,
Holy Shit.

2268
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:06,910
He was.
He was a powerful man.

2269
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:11,350
I mean his material was really funny,
but shit,

2270
01:50:11,351 --> 01:50:14,080
his delivery was like,
like electric,

2271
01:50:14,081 --> 01:50:15,790
like boom,
boom.

2272
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:18,490
And His name of black comedian where you
go.

2273
01:50:18,491 --> 01:50:21,790
His material is great,
but as deliveries under sold,

2274
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:27,180
um,
don't say animals.

2275
01:50:27,610 --> 01:50:29,500
Got a good delivery.
Get this thing going on.

2276
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:32,890
He's my buddy Franklin Gi.
Oh,

2277
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:37,920
Franklin at giant.
The giant super low key with his 

2278
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:41,341
delivery.
Hilarious ideas and met him at the 

2279
01:50:41,341 --> 01:50:44,650
greenroom.
Paul provenza wished that show is still 

2280
01:50:44,650 --> 01:50:47,641
on.
Let's do the green room with Doug's 

2281
01:50:47,641 --> 01:50:47,641
hope.
Well,

2282
01:50:47,641 --> 01:50:48,440
podcasting is basically that.
It is that as,

2283
01:50:48,610 --> 01:50:50,380
but let's get on showtime for the fuck 
of it.

2284
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:53,750
Shit.
So we can call her mom's show time.

2285
01:50:54,010 --> 01:50:57,190
Mommy and my mom's data.
I forgot I said that right.

2286
01:50:57,191 --> 01:50:57,970
I was.
I was like,

2287
01:50:57,971 --> 01:50:58,780
man,
I feel guilty.

2288
01:50:58,810 --> 01:50:59,420
Oh,
it's stand up.

2289
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:02,770
Don't have to feel bad.
I will call my grandma.

2290
01:51:03,030 --> 01:51:08,030
My grandma's doing bro.
Fucking Chad Shanky just came back from 

2291
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:08,290
thanksgiving.
He's like,

2292
01:51:08,291 --> 01:51:09,250
uh,
yeah.

2293
01:51:09,251 --> 01:51:12,040
I had to go to my grandparents' house.
Does he work for you?

2294
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:15,960
Does he know it's December fifth kind of
fucking bullshit.

2295
01:51:15,961 --> 01:51:18,640
Is this?
Does that mean thanksgiving?

2296
01:51:18,890 --> 01:51:20,720
Long time ago,
motherfucker this work to be done?

2297
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:25,790
No.
The point of the story was he was 

2298
01:51:25,790 --> 01:51:28,870
talking about being at Thanksgiving at 
his grandparent's house,

2299
01:51:28,871 --> 01:51:32,920
who we revered and then how he brought 
his kid and his kids.

2300
01:51:32,921 --> 01:51:36,640
Kids to globe,
Arizona because he's not a family guy.

2301
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:38,860
Right.
But then I started doing the math,

2302
01:51:38,861 --> 01:51:42,640
like you have grandchildren and 
grandparents.

2303
01:51:42,730 --> 01:51:46,150
That means the kids are going to meet 
their great,

2304
01:51:46,151 --> 01:51:47,830
great grandparents.

2305
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:49,900
Did you ever meet your great,
great grandparents?

2306
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:51,340
Oh my.
Almost all.

2307
01:51:51,370 --> 01:51:56,370
My last grandparent died when I was 13 
and both of my grandfathers were dead 

2308
01:51:56,771 --> 01:51:59,590
before I was born.
My great,

2309
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:03,100
great grandfather on my.
You were alive in the mud.

2310
01:52:03,330 --> 01:52:03,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

2311
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,590
Holy Shit.
I barely remember though.

2312
01:52:06,670 --> 01:52:09,380
Super Young.
Really great parents.

2313
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:14,940
Great.
Great grandparents are the people that 

2314
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:17,161
built the stone that built this town 
before it was a town and this was all 

2315
01:52:17,411 --> 01:52:18,640
waste water.
Well,

2316
01:52:18,641 --> 01:52:23,641
my great,
great grandfather decided to take his 

2317
01:52:23,641 --> 01:52:25,741
family from Italy to America in the 19.
Well basically draw.

2318
01:52:26,241 --> 01:52:28,380
That's right.
Your mom's a Guinea better.

2319
01:52:28,570 --> 01:52:30,180
Yeah,
she's full on pop.

2320
01:52:30,370 --> 01:52:31,420
Sorry.
Yeah,

2321
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:34,210
she's full on Kenny.
And uh,

2322
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:37,210
my father was half Italian,
half Irish.

2323
01:52:37,211 --> 01:52:40,480
The everybody was immigrants though from
my mom's side.

2324
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:42,230
One hundred percent.
My mother,

2325
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:43,710
my mother,
her,

2326
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:46,640
her mother and her father,
both from the old country.

2327
01:52:46,641 --> 01:52:49,370
They see.
We don't realize it because we're living

2328
01:52:49,371 --> 01:52:54,371
in this weird fucking semi gentrified 
starbucks era of 2017.

2329
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:59,950
But just during my parents' time,
people got on boats and they drifted 

2330
01:52:59,950 --> 01:53:04,520
from Europe across America and these 
shitty engines and they landed.

2331
01:53:04,521 --> 01:53:09,521
I mean,
it was like fucking decades after the 

2332
01:53:09,521 --> 01:53:09,521
titanic sank.
These crazy fucks.

2333
01:53:09,521 --> 01:53:13,580
They took the wildest chance ever.
They floated across the Goddamn Atlantic

2334
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:16,370
Ocean to look for a better role in gut.
Here on coach.

2335
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:16,830
Hey,

2336
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:21,430
who from southwest?
He was sitting right next to the toilet,

2337
01:53:21,810 --> 01:53:26,810
almost had a middle seat,
but he finagled his way out of it to an 

2338
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:26,810
aisle.

2339
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:28,960
The boarding

2340
01:53:29,050 --> 01:53:30,880
group,
a 15 through 30.

2341
01:53:31,170 --> 01:53:32,800
I mean,
this shit just happened.

2342
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:36,160
Our families all just got here.
Even if you're third generation,

2343
01:53:36,161 --> 01:53:38,410
that's fucking three generations.
That ain't shit.

2344
01:53:38,740 --> 01:53:41,380
It's nothing.
Fourth-Generation fifth,

2345
01:53:41,410 --> 01:53:44,050
shut the fuck Mark Burns who have been 
here since the 19 hundreds.

2346
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:48,580
Who Know that you just got here.
Everybody just got here.

2347
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:51,480
I live in one of those towns where they,
they,

2348
01:53:51,550 --> 01:53:52,810
they love to say,
Oh,

2349
01:53:52,811 --> 01:53:53,830
I'm a native.
Like,

2350
01:53:54,330 --> 01:53:59,330
that makes you better because you never 
left and decided you wanted to be here 

2351
01:53:59,330 --> 01:54:03,811
as a functioning free thinking.
Adult natives are the first people you 

2352
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:08,050
discount was born hero.
You just moved here.

2353
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:08,710
Well,
yeah,

2354
01:54:08,711 --> 01:54:12,550
because I was an adult and I decided I 
wanted to live here.

2355
01:54:12,610 --> 01:54:15,490
You just didn't have the courage to 
leave and come back.

2356
01:54:15,790 --> 01:54:18,970
Yeah.
Sons of bitches fuck natives.

2357
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:21,190
It's not easy.
It's not even that.

2358
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:22,900
Honestly,
that was a native.

2359
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,820
Not Native Americans.
I know what you mean.

2360
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:27,280
They don't know where to go.
They're drunk.

2361
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:31,810
The busy people don't know where to go.
You don't have to go anywhere.

2362
01:54:33,010 --> 01:54:36,940
Just make the place better.
But the Vegas Vegas is one of those.

2363
01:54:37,420 --> 01:54:42,420
Any city that is a only alive and 
thriving because of tourism,

2364
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
but then they take a stand because I was
born here.

2365
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:47,020
Well,
Vegas,

2366
01:54:47,290 --> 01:54:48,460
Vegas,
Hawaii,

2367
01:54:48,490 --> 01:54:51,760
Hawaii does it with white people a 
little bit,

2368
01:54:51,761 --> 01:54:54,070
but it'll knowing why they hate 
tourists,

2369
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:57,640
but if it wasn't for tourists,
you're fucking farming pineapples.

2370
01:54:57,820 --> 01:55:02,820
Are you finding farming pineapples?
Are you selling crocs somewhere in a 

2371
01:55:03,070 --> 01:55:05,770
beach resort?
Are you doing massage therapy?

2372
01:55:05,771 --> 01:55:08,890
Are you doing chakra healing or are you 
farming pineapples?

2373
01:55:08,891 --> 01:55:13,891
Because without tourists,
you're farming pineapples and hoping 

2374
01:55:13,891 --> 01:55:17,970
Captain Cook's descendants come back and
offer you some gifts,

2375
01:55:18,610 --> 01:55:23,610
or you're eating fish that you just 
caught with a stick and you're trading 

2376
01:55:23,610 --> 01:55:25,840
money in the form of shells on a string.
Right?

2377
01:55:25,870 --> 01:55:28,360
That's okay too.
Like why is bitcoin okay?

2378
01:55:28,361 --> 01:55:29,530
But shells aren't good.

2379
01:55:31,810 --> 01:55:34,930
How come we can't treat you just paid me
in shells to be here.

2380
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:36,340
Yeah,
that's what I'm going to give you.

2381
01:55:36,730 --> 01:55:41,730
Lumps of salt too.
There were little lumps of salt and 

2382
01:55:41,730 --> 01:55:44,731
chocolate and the chocolate.
Gold coins and ketogenic cookies and 

2383
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:48,030
Stevia drinks.
Stevia drinks.

2384
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,180
Okay.
Over there.

2385
01:55:50,181 --> 01:55:52,670
Let's do some ad copy.
God dammit.

2386
01:55:52,770 --> 01:55:53,640
What's up?
Okay,

2387
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:54,930
I'm fine.
Alright buddy.

2388
01:55:55,900 --> 01:55:58,400
I want to ask you this headphones.
Hang on.

2389
01:55:58,770 --> 01:56:03,510
Joe Rogan was just in right before I 
shut off my phone.

2390
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:05,860
Giant.
Now.

2391
01:56:07,050 --> 01:56:08,940
Oh yeah,
please order the book.

2392
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:14,090
You know what?
Let's take a minute so people can go 

2393
01:56:14,090 --> 01:56:14,880
online and order.
Doug Stan hope this is not fame.

2394
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:18,600
It's got awful stories that in the 
current climate,

2395
01:56:18,601 --> 01:56:20,700
if the publisher read it right now,
they'd go,

2396
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:23,700
we should probably pull this because.
Yeah.

2397
01:56:23,710 --> 01:56:28,710
So if you find it folks,
everyone else is getting fired for what 

2398
01:56:28,710 --> 01:56:28,920
I'm celebrating,
having done worse,

2399
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:33,980
copy it,
copy it down and make sure these 

2400
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:33,980
monsters out there.

2401
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:34,750
Don't take it off the Internet.
I have.

2402
01:56:35,310 --> 01:56:39,990
I have the.
You have the new beautiful space here.

2403
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:42,780
Thing.
Endless yards and yards of space.

2404
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:46,980
The Wolf,
you have the giant wolf out there.

2405
01:56:46,981 --> 01:56:51,960
When you walk in the door there.
Is that a Patrick Mcgee?

2406
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:55,570
Yes.
Goes to ride.

2407
01:56:55,690 --> 01:57:00,690
You know Chaley.
Remember when I used to pit my tour 

2408
01:57:00,690 --> 01:57:00,690
manager against your red band,
Greg.

2409
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:01,350
He's.
Yeah,

2410
01:57:01,351 --> 01:57:02,480
he's my guy.
He loves.

2411
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,380
I love him.
On Your podcast.

2412
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:09,440
He,
him and his twin brother do that for a 

2413
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:13,131
living.
They have their own ghost ride 

2414
01:57:13,131 --> 01:57:13,131
productions,
which is a huge hot.

2415
01:57:13,131 --> 01:57:18,110
They make this shit.
Patrick Mcgee that did your woolf works 

2416
01:57:18,110 --> 01:57:22,161
for Greg Chili's twin brother.
That's a ghost ride productions if you 

2417
01:57:22,161 --> 01:57:23,850
want weird shit like that.
Joe Rogan,

2418
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:28,650
I hope you're a loyal sponsor now.
I've only ghost ride productions.

2419
01:57:28,890 --> 01:57:30,790
They do all this shit.
Shaylee does the.

2420
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:35,160
He does a haunted house at the in the 
front yard in Brisbane.

2421
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:38,520
He does haunted front yard and he brings
all this shit down.

2422
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:41,070
Every Halloween is so geeked up to do 
it.

2423
01:57:41,810 --> 01:57:45,840
The only thing is maybe I want it to be 
one of these guys when I was a kid too.

2424
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:50,880
That was a huge star wars fan to the 
point where I wanted to be like a Rick 

2425
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:50,880
Baker.
I wanted to do that for a living.

2426
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:56,210
And uh,
Pat Mcgee was on the podcast and we're 

2427
01:57:56,210 --> 01:57:57,930
both huge fans of an American in London.
That's a biggie.

2428
01:57:57,960 --> 01:57:59,510
That's right there.
That right there.

2429
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:02,380
He was on the podcast a few years back 
and uh,

2430
01:58:02,381 --> 01:58:07,381
I,
I found the American Werewolf in London 

2431
01:58:07,381 --> 01:58:07,381
that,
that a cop,

2432
01:58:07,381 --> 01:58:07,381
what it is,
is a,

2433
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:10,980
it's a replica of the thing that's in 
the movie and Pat sells it.

2434
01:58:10,981 --> 01:58:13,770
You can order it online and he,
um,

2435
01:58:14,010 --> 01:58:18,120
he builds it,
but it's like the real exact scales,

2436
01:58:18,121 --> 01:58:20,880
like one and a half times the size,
the real werewolf,

2437
01:58:20,881 --> 01:58:21,990
the Werewolf,
a smaller.

2438
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:25,860
My werewolves bigger.
I just texted when we got here today,

2439
01:58:25,861 --> 01:58:29,850
I texted a picture that,
that to Chile and he goes,

2440
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:30,960
oh,
that looks like a,

2441
01:58:30,961 --> 01:58:31,530
a.
I go,

2442
01:58:31,531 --> 01:58:33,060
hey,
how's this for Halloween?

2443
01:58:33,061 --> 01:58:36,600
Two thousand 18 for is haunted Yardi,
doesn't Bisbee,

2444
01:58:36,601 --> 01:58:39,090
and he goes,
that looks like a Patrick Mcgee.

2445
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,350
He's done work for my brother.
I.

2446
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:42,130
Wow,
if you called

2447
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:45,280
that and Joe Rogan,
you fucking amazing.

2448
01:58:45,370 --> 01:58:47,500
He nailed it.
I think I had to correct myself.

2449
01:58:47,501 --> 01:58:49,150
I said it's a one and a half times 
larger.

2450
01:58:49,151 --> 01:58:52,060
I don't think that's right.
I think it's more like 40 percent larger

2451
01:58:52,061 --> 01:58:53,290
or something.
Now that I think about it,

2452
01:58:53,291 --> 01:58:54,910
I think I'm confusing it with something 
else,

2453
01:58:55,420 --> 01:59:00,420
but the the copy that he makes is 
definitely larger so he could work on 

2454
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:03,960
the finer details.
There's like blood on the teeth and the 

2455
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:07,411
hairs.
It's all yak hair around the head and 

2456
01:59:07,411 --> 01:59:07,411
it's all synthetic shit in the back,
but that's,

2457
01:59:07,411 --> 01:59:09,910
that's his work.
But if you look at like the blood around

2458
01:59:09,911 --> 01:59:11,560
the teeth do.
Here's the thing,

2459
01:59:11,561 --> 01:59:12,520
man.
Fucking amazing.

2460
01:59:12,521 --> 01:59:16,030
I get great pleasure every time I come 
to work and I look at that Werewolf.

2461
01:59:17,670 --> 01:59:20,380
I fucking love it.
I love it.

2462
01:59:20,381 --> 01:59:24,280
I love looking at that thing.
I love the fact that I'm a fucking grown

2463
01:59:24,281 --> 01:59:24,490
up

2464
01:59:24,770 --> 01:59:28,270
be used for anymore.
I smile all the time.

2465
01:59:28,271 --> 01:59:29,390
Yeah,
yeah.

2466
01:59:29,391 --> 01:59:32,240
Well you were showing us some shit and 
you just smiled like,

2467
01:59:32,390 --> 01:59:34,800
wow,
that's so fucking rare smile.

2468
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:36,550
You used to be a lot angrier.

2469
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:39,140
I like it.
I got out of that.

2470
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:41,270
You know what it's like we were talking 
about before.

2471
01:59:41,271 --> 01:59:44,570
It's like,
what do you use in your energy on?

2472
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:49,600
Are you using your energy on being upset
at things and being in this constant 

2473
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:53,351
sort of like a momentum of being upset 
from the past that you never stop or do 

2474
01:59:54,111 --> 01:59:56,030
you figure out a way to like hit the 
brakes?

2475
01:59:56,150 --> 01:59:56,720
I go,
okay,

2476
01:59:57,710 --> 01:59:59,850
why are we angry?
What are we getting upset?

2477
01:59:59,930 --> 02:00:04,820
Why don't we just take all that cave man
Shit and just go smash some punching bag

2478
02:00:05,030 --> 02:00:07,820
and then come back to reality and be 
like really relaxed about it,

2479
02:00:07,821 --> 02:00:12,821
but do it purposely like have some sort 
of intent behind it to eliminate the 

2480
02:00:12,821 --> 02:00:15,710
demons and I figured out how to do that.
Somewhere along the line.

2481
02:00:15,790 --> 02:00:19,020
Aging helps a lot,
but it's not

2482
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:22,420
just that it's not aging as far as like 
decay,

2483
02:00:22,450 --> 02:00:24,470
it's aging as far as information.
Right?

2484
02:00:24,710 --> 02:00:26,060
Like I was talking about like if you 
were.

2485
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:30,970
If people figure out a way to make 
humans live to be like 900 years old,

2486
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:35,470
would it be fucked up if you had sex 
with 50 year old people like you fucking

2487
02:00:35,471 --> 02:00:37,330
asshole.
She doesn't even know any better.

2488
02:00:37,331 --> 02:00:39,910
It's only 50.
She's basically a baby.

2489
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:44,100
Did you treat him like that until 
they're 50 and say you're not an adult.

2490
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:45,210
I know.
I know.

2491
02:00:45,211 --> 02:00:48,000
You're 12.
You can have a baby right now.

2492
02:00:48,001 --> 02:00:51,540
Nature has said you are ready to 
actually procreate,

2493
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:55,200
but we've legislated that you can't be 
an adult until you're 18,

2494
02:00:55,470 --> 02:01:00,030
so for the next six years we're just 
going to treat you like a baby.

2495
02:01:00,630 --> 02:01:04,470
That's an unnecessary burden for the boy
and the girl and the lack of

2496
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:06,760
you're,
you're,

2497
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:11,780
you're,
you're telling them every feeling that 

2498
02:01:11,780 --> 02:01:14,030
you have naturally is wrong.
We're not going to explain that to you,

2499
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:19,100
right?
Because we want to give you a good 

2500
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:21,731
childhood.
You shouldn't have to deal with all 

2501
02:01:21,731 --> 02:01:21,731
these adult.
Well,

2502
02:01:21,731 --> 02:01:25,780
that's what their body's telling them,
so you better be honest or all of a 

2503
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:28,730
sudden your kids fucking a 38 year old 
producer.

2504
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:29,480
Well,
it's also

2505
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:34,740
problem with like looking at children as
being different than a person and it's 

2506
02:01:34,740 --> 02:01:34,740
like,
no,

2507
02:01:34,740 --> 02:01:35,920
this is mine.
I made them.

2508
02:01:35,921 --> 02:01:39,040
You are not going to like boys Michael,
you,

2509
02:01:39,610 --> 02:01:40,010
you're going

2510
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:45,020
to like girls because you're a boy and 
you're going to carry on the Harris' 

2511
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:45,100
name.
Okay.

2512
02:01:46,780 --> 02:01:51,780
I'm would,
I would have a kid just for the longterm

2513
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,450
practical joke of raising him gay,
lesbian,

2514
02:01:56,451 --> 02:02:01,451
Youtube and say I was just trying to.
Who just had a kid and know he's trying 

2515
02:02:02,931 --> 02:02:05,900
to pitch them this.
Brendan,

2516
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:10,700
Brendan Walsh like,
just go and just act like you're raising

2517
02:02:10,701 --> 02:02:14,840
your kid gay and you know when you get 
older to men,

2518
02:02:14,841 --> 02:02:17,570
meet each other and just say this to a 
baby.

2519
02:02:18,110 --> 02:02:21,080
I think you could easily in this is 
gonna sound fucked up.

2520
02:02:21,410 --> 02:02:25,640
I think you can easily convince a young 
kid that like,

2521
02:02:25,641 --> 02:02:30,350
sex with males is normal if everyone's 
doing it.

2522
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:30,960
No,
no.

2523
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:36,020
The idea was you have to still sex shame
the kid.

2524
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:39,170
It's only okay to be gay once you're 
married,

2525
02:02:39,171 --> 02:02:41,870
after you're 18,
but you're gay,

2526
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:45,010
so these are doing.
You're married to a girl or a guy.

2527
02:02:45,050 --> 02:02:47,300
The end game is the kid has to 
eventually,

2528
02:02:47,301 --> 02:02:52,301
when he's 18,
come out as straight to his parents and 

2529
02:02:52,301 --> 02:02:56,500
that's a problem.
If you have really progressive parents 

2530
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:56,500
are like,
dude,

2531
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:56,500
we got Super Street creds for you being 
gay.

2532
02:02:56,500 --> 02:03:01,090
You piece of shit.
Do you think you can be straight but 

2533
02:03:01,090 --> 02:03:01,090
trends you think you're willing to go 
there?

2534
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:05,900
They'll sit down at the table of 
Progressive Brownie points.

2535
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:08,750
We were really happy about you being 
gay,

2536
02:03:08,751 --> 02:03:11,930
Michael and you being straight is 
frankly,

2537
02:03:11,931 --> 02:03:15,590
it's a big bummer to our social system.
It's like they're going to think,

2538
02:03:15,650 --> 02:03:17,960
here's what we're going to work at the 
law firm,

2539
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:23,080
they're gonna think we shamed you out of
being gay and that's simply not the 

2540
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:25,700
case.
We have.

2541
02:03:25,701 --> 02:03:30,701
It's so easy gel where we can sit here 
with white privilege.

2542
02:03:31,170 --> 02:03:32,030
Yeah,
we have.

2543
02:03:32,060 --> 02:03:34,550
We're not like Sam Cedar Comedy 
Privilege,

2544
02:03:34,551 --> 02:03:39,551
which we have in droves,
which is way more way better diamond 

2545
02:03:40,221 --> 02:03:44,150
elite status than just white privilege.
We have comedy privilege.

2546
02:03:44,170 --> 02:03:45,650
It's true.
They're just kidding.

2547
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:46,580
No,
we're not,

2548
02:03:46,970 --> 02:03:48,680
but it says comic.
Okay.

2549
02:03:48,681 --> 02:03:51,260
If you're going to get comfy about it.
I was just kidding.

2550
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:53,070
And then it's all golden.
Well,

2551
02:03:53,110 --> 02:03:58,110
years clearly kidding,
because you're not saying it's 

2552
02:03:58,110 --> 02:03:58,820
specifically in a form where they trying
to disseminate information.

2553
02:03:59,090 --> 02:04:04,090
He try to be funny as well.
So you'll say extreme things that don't 

2554
02:04:04,090 --> 02:04:06,410
necessarily represent your actual 
viewpoint just because you want it to be

2555
02:04:06,411 --> 02:04:09,530
more hilarious.
If Sam Cedar were funny all the time,

2556
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:11,530
rather than that one tweet who'd be 
fine.

2557
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:14,930
Sorry Sam.
Brightmore.

2558
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:18,490
Jesus.
It's true.

2559
02:04:18,590 --> 02:04:23,590
But we have the luxury of having a 
social circle that is very tolerant to 

2560
02:04:25,610 --> 02:04:29,660
the n word degree tolerant in a green.
Wait a minute.

2561
02:04:29,690 --> 02:04:33,020
You can't say nigger word degree.
Oh,

2562
02:04:33,021 --> 02:04:34,070
that was yesterday.
I.

2563
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:39,220
It doesn't even make sense.
It sounds like a gratuitous use of the 

2564
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:39,220
N.
No,

2565
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:41,190
I was saying that in a green room when 
it's just comics nigger,

2566
02:04:41,191 --> 02:04:44,670
retard con,
diked fucking everything flies.

2567
02:04:44,671 --> 02:04:45,600
Yes,
and when it doesn't,

2568
02:04:45,601 --> 02:04:48,480
you get super upset.
Like if someone says,

2569
02:04:48,481 --> 02:04:49,380
ah,
she's a con,

2570
02:04:49,410 --> 02:04:50,280
and someone goes,
hey man,

2571
02:04:50,620 --> 02:04:52,500
really shouldn't feel upset.
What you say,

2572
02:04:52,501 --> 02:04:57,501
you're a cunt to a feminist comedian in 
the confines of a Green Room.

2573
02:04:59,130 --> 02:05:01,890
Everyone's free and clear.
It leaves the green rooms.

2574
02:05:01,891 --> 02:05:04,200
I've been part of.
Nobody has a problem with Yukon.

2575
02:05:04,210 --> 02:05:05,850
Amanda Monacan?
Nope.

2576
02:05:05,851 --> 02:05:08,760
Not In the UK,
but I mean even in America if you will,

2577
02:05:08,761 --> 02:05:11,730
that the guy I've really as a con,
right?

2578
02:05:11,910 --> 02:05:12,570
Like,
sorry,

2579
02:05:12,571 --> 02:05:14,940
you looked immediately San again when 
you said that.

2580
02:05:14,941 --> 02:05:15,810
I'm just,
he's looking at me,

2581
02:05:15,811 --> 02:05:18,150
he's not a and I'm just trying to bring 
them into the conversation.

2582
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:23,510
Like if you're,
you mean pull him out of his fucking 

2583
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:23,510
laptop a little bit,
but you know,

2584
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:23,660
owns.
We're all talking.

2585
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:26,220
We're friends.
Like Saddam Hussein was a cunt.

2586
02:05:26,980 --> 02:05:31,980
His kid would cons his kids.
I heard there were cuts those sons.

2587
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:35,310
Nobody cares.
You could say that the two.

2588
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:37,440
I don't know.
He might've had other sons.

2589
02:05:37,441 --> 02:05:42,441
I don't know if they're kind of shift.
There were two cousins who was one of 

2590
02:05:42,441 --> 02:05:42,570
them,
cuts.

2591
02:05:43,820 --> 02:05:47,790
They apparently like would find people 
where they were getting married.

2592
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:50,940
They would take the broad raper and then
they would feed her two dogs.

2593
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:57,200
Well that's a little calendula.
They were off the top evil over the top.

2594
02:05:57,930 --> 02:05:58,980
Whoa.
Yeah.

2595
02:05:59,130 --> 02:06:01,170
I read that and I had to stop reading.
I was like,

2596
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:02,940
okay,
I can't go on with us.

2597
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,450
That's another thing about aging,
not giving a fuck,

2598
02:06:06,451 --> 02:06:10,680
but also giving more of a fuck.
We were kids were the same age.

2599
02:06:11,010 --> 02:06:14,970
We would watch all that faces a death.
Couldn't get enough of it.

2600
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:16,740
Now I don't want to.
No,

2601
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:18,210
no,
I can't watch that shit.

2602
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:20,230
Did you try that Steve?
You know,

2603
02:06:21,470 --> 02:06:24,540
of course.
Looking at it,

2604
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:25,650
I'm like,
he cracked that.

2605
02:06:25,651 --> 02:06:27,510
He's never going to drink it.
Never going to drink it.

2606
02:06:28,770 --> 02:06:30,150
So good.
It makes my dick hard.

2607
02:06:30,970 --> 02:06:33,990
Thing goes all sugar free and she,
she,

2608
02:06:34,050 --> 02:06:38,310
she used to like get a diet coke.
We're going through a drive through diet

2609
02:06:38,311 --> 02:06:43,311
coke and they pressed the little thing 
on the top of the to show you which 

2610
02:06:43,311 --> 02:06:43,920
one's diet,
which ones?

2611
02:06:43,921 --> 02:06:48,921
Regular check this to make sure because 
she knows how much I hate artificial 

2612
02:06:48,921 --> 02:06:50,140
sweeteners.
Tea,

2613
02:06:50,250 --> 02:06:53,820
I don't want to know because I don't 
drink that for the aftertaste.

2614
02:06:53,821 --> 02:06:56,790
Never leaves your fucking mouth.
Stevie is no different.

2615
02:06:56,791 --> 02:06:59,020
Splenda,
what's the sucralose?

2616
02:06:59,970 --> 02:07:04,920
It's awful.
If you just try this for me.

2617
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:10,220
If you're thirsty,
diabetic and you pull up to the Wendy's 

2618
02:07:10,220 --> 02:07:10,220
drive through at 1:45
AM,

2619
02:07:10,220 --> 02:07:11,880
what percentage of the time do you get a
giant Vat of sugar?

2620
02:07:13,890 --> 02:07:17,850
If you like extra large diet coke.
That's it.

2621
02:07:18,210 --> 02:07:22,440
Okay.
Don't at least one out of 100.

2622
02:07:22,441 --> 02:07:24,810
You're getting Nevada sugar water,
right?

2623
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:26,640
At least 100 mean.
I'm assuming.

2624
02:07:26,641 --> 02:07:31,641
It's kind of like in restaurants.
They don't bring anything other than 

2625
02:07:31,641 --> 02:07:31,641
DECAF.
After 8:00,

2626
02:07:31,641 --> 02:07:35,990
I think the dude who's monitoring that 
thing is gonna slip on a of his own 

2627
02:07:35,990 --> 02:07:39,080
drool and slammed his head into the 
regular coke and it's gonna.

2628
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:40,990
Fill your shit up,
but something that's going to give you a

2629
02:07:40,991 --> 02:07:42,280
seizure.
That's what I think.

2630
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:44,650
I'm going to fill that fucking thing up 
to the top.

2631
02:07:44,651 --> 02:07:46,960
Very little eyes.
Oh,

2632
02:07:46,961 --> 02:07:50,650
this is where I was going.
I fucking had a thing I was going to.

2633
02:07:50,830 --> 02:07:52,900
Oh,
this is about Hennigan.

2634
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:54,460
Yeah.
Last year,

2635
02:07:55,090 --> 02:07:57,760
a year ago.
A little bit over a year ago.

2636
02:07:58,970 --> 02:08:01,250
End of the world podcast.
Oh know.

2637
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:03,370
I don't know if I've seen you once since
then.

2638
02:08:03,610 --> 02:08:08,610
I think we saw each other once you came 
to the store once you'd been back on 

2639
02:08:08,610 --> 02:08:08,610
here.

2640
02:08:08,610 --> 02:08:09,220
I think,
I don't know,

2641
02:08:09,310 --> 02:08:12,730
maybe maybe the end of the world 
podcast.

2642
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:18,300
I was not in a good place to say least,
but I will tell you one thing that I 

2643
02:08:18,431 --> 02:08:19,630
said to all my friends,
I said,

2644
02:08:19,631 --> 02:08:24,631
I admire the fact that you push through 
it and even though you were like a 

2645
02:08:24,631 --> 02:08:26,290
little bit like flustered,
you were still gregarious.

2646
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:30,040
I can't watch the video.
I'm sure you were in a weird place.

2647
02:08:30,041 --> 02:08:35,041
We tell everybody why,
and my Gal Bingo had just gone into a 

2648
02:08:36,010 --> 02:08:38,680
possibly terminal.
She had a seizure,

2649
02:08:38,860 --> 02:08:41,230
fell down,
smashed her head on the cement,

2650
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:44,410
life-flighted in a coma.
She might not make it.

2651
02:08:44,411 --> 02:08:49,411
If she does make it,
it might be worst than not making it at 

2652
02:08:49,411 --> 02:08:49,600
all.
And I said,

2653
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:51,670
uh,
I didn't know how to handle that.

2654
02:08:52,060 --> 02:08:53,500
Fuck,
I didn't know either,

2655
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:58,210
but I made the decision since it 
happened during her 40th birthday party.

2656
02:08:58,210 --> 02:09:02,150
So all of our friends and family were at
the house in [inaudible].

2657
02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:07,530
It happens.
So she's surrounded by all these people 

2658
02:09:07,530 --> 02:09:08,950
who took a week off to be there for a 
five day party.

2659
02:09:08,951 --> 02:09:12,040
They're there.
I can't help her.

2660
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:15,310
She's in a coma.
Me Standing with the family,

2661
02:09:15,311 --> 02:09:18,040
staring at a half corpse is not going to
help bucket.

2662
02:09:18,041 --> 02:09:20,110
I'm going to do this thing.
This is a big deal.

2663
02:09:20,111 --> 02:09:24,490
And it was a huge.
Them epic Douglas.

2664
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:26,390
Fucking amazing.
We were there when Doug,

2665
02:09:26,470 --> 02:09:31,470
Donald Trump was elected president and 
bill burr might've had the greatest 

2666
02:09:31,470 --> 02:09:33,070
podcast appearance of all time.
It was like,

2667
02:09:33,071 --> 02:09:34,660
it was like one of them,
Michael Jordan,

2668
02:09:34,661 --> 02:09:36,280
things that you would walk your kid and 
you're like,

2669
02:09:36,281 --> 02:09:38,860
what the fuck?
It's how he,

2670
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:43,360
his whole heckler youtube thing in 
Philly.

2671
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:48,040
That's him.
And now he one upped it by doing the end

2672
02:09:48,041 --> 02:09:49,900
of the world podcast fire.

2673
02:09:50,020 --> 02:09:51,130
It was on fire.
I mean,

2674
02:09:51,131 --> 02:09:53,050
he was on fire with a point where 
everybody's stepped back,

2675
02:09:53,051 --> 02:09:58,051
except who was the gal that had a 
different Sarah?

2676
02:09:58,230 --> 02:10:00,220
I don't know if it was all because of 
Brian Hennigan.

2677
02:10:00,240 --> 02:10:05,240
Exactly.
So this is where we're going because I 

2678
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:05,980
wanted to name drop Olivia grace.
She's hilarious.

2679
02:10:05,981 --> 02:10:08,830
Fucking funny.
She was like 17.

2680
02:10:09,430 --> 02:10:09,970
Yeah,
she's,

2681
02:10:10,450 --> 02:10:13,240
she said she started once.
She's 18 now she's 22.

2682
02:10:13,241 --> 02:10:17,640
She just did a show up my house.
They were just on tour that lend a.

2683
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:20,920
God dammit.
I can't remember something Jewish.

2684
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:23,830
Uh,
with the first name June with juicing.

2685
02:10:23,950 --> 02:10:26,440
Oh No,
they're on tour.

2686
02:10:26,770 --> 02:10:27,580
Fuck,
I'm sorry.

2687
02:10:27,581 --> 02:10:28,870
Julie Guy.
Julie.

2688
02:10:28,871 --> 02:10:29,900
Julie.
Uh,

2689
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:32,080
they were both funny.
They showed up.

2690
02:10:32,830 --> 02:10:34,180
Julie

2691
02:10:35,110 --> 02:10:37,120
goddamned look it up,
find it somehow.

2692
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:41,570
Olivia grace's twitter,
she's on tour.

2693
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:43,910
Olivia grades.
So they come through,

2694
02:10:43,911 --> 02:10:48,911
they had a night off and they stayed at 
the house and we forced them to do a 

2695
02:10:48,911 --> 02:10:48,911
show.
Oh,

2696
02:10:48,911 --> 02:10:50,900
it's sounds like great.
I don't know if that was Thanksgiving or

2697
02:10:50,901 --> 02:10:52,940
what.
You forced them to do a show.

2698
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Yeah.
Well she's going to have to watch me 

2699
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:58,250
jerk off in 20 years doing a show.
Forcing someone to do a show is going to

2700
02:10:58,251 --> 02:11:00,320
be the new rate.
Eric Friedman,

2701
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:02,210
Eric Friedman,
Julie,

2702
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:03,560
the first names.
Not True.

2703
02:11:03,561 --> 02:11:05,000
Anyway,
they went up,

2704
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:08,280
so you have original soul rock Kenny go 
up and do rapid burst,

2705
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:12,490
so we'll have a little stage in our 
little fun house where we do our podcast

2706
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:15,500
that we.
We can make it a show like that and it's

2707
02:11:15,501 --> 02:11:19,170
always the best audiences.
Never as a shell failed there.

2708
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,670
They're always great because my house 
yet,

2709
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:23,660
but my.
The people that come to my house,

2710
02:11:23,690 --> 02:11:28,690
don't.
They couldn't name their favorite 

2711
02:11:28,690 --> 02:11:28,690
comedian because they don't know.
They'd go,

2712
02:11:28,690 --> 02:11:28,850
Whoa,
Jim Belushi,

2713
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:30,860
Zio comedian.
Still they don't.

2714
02:11:31,130 --> 02:11:32,960
They're great.
They killed.

2715
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:34,630
She fucking crushed.
Cool.

2716
02:11:34,770 --> 02:11:39,770
What she told me,
let's get back to the end of the world 

2717
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:40,940
podcast.
I had told Hennigan,

2718
02:11:42,830 --> 02:11:47,830
yeah,
we should probably have some kind of 

2719
02:11:47,830 --> 02:11:50,291
diversity.
This is before that night deal.

2720
02:11:51,560 --> 02:11:53,870
Well,
now when we were planning it out,

2721
02:11:53,871 --> 02:11:57,440
what it should be that night,
I'm fucked my head.

2722
02:11:57,441 --> 02:12:01,400
Is My lady going to live or die?
Why am I here?

2723
02:12:01,401 --> 02:12:05,000
I shouldn't have done this.
Let's make the best of it.

2724
02:12:05,030 --> 02:12:10,030
I go in the bathroom and the shower some
for some reason they have a shower,

2725
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:12,420
the back of the comedy store and the 
Green.

2726
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:18,880
So stupid.
I would go back there and I'd fucking 

2727
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:21,791
fall apart crying and then I come back 
out on stage and try to keep it 

2728
02:12:21,791 --> 02:12:21,791
together.
Well,

2729
02:12:21,791 --> 02:12:25,940
Hennigan is still thinking.
I told what we need women on this.

2730
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:28,400
It's all white men,
so he's just.

2731
02:12:29,210 --> 02:12:34,210
He has no discretion.
He's just getting any woman and forcing 

2732
02:12:34,701 --> 02:12:37,550
her onstage and you're going,
what the fuck?

2733
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,800
Why isn't I know that I was.
No,

2734
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:40,730
no.
You didn't know.

2735
02:12:41,150 --> 02:12:43,250
You were saying why she.
I go,

2736
02:12:43,251 --> 02:12:44,510
I,
it's probably my fault.

2737
02:12:44,630 --> 02:12:48,020
I probably.
Why your manager saying we need women.

2738
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:49,640
While that's probably.
I probably said it,

2739
02:12:49,641 --> 02:12:50,060
but uh,

2740
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:55,620
here's the thing that's important.
Most of the people that you had on that 

2741
02:12:55,620 --> 02:12:56,320
day is that,
that stage,

2742
02:12:56,350 --> 02:13:00,700
whether it's bill burr or whether it's 
Bert Kreischer or doug or me.

2743
02:13:00,940 --> 02:13:04,900
Jeffrey showed up at his kid.
That was the weirdest thing was that was

2744
02:13:04,901 --> 02:13:09,901
weird.
He came on stage with a little kid and 

2745
02:13:09,901 --> 02:13:09,901
we were like,
hey man,

2746
02:13:09,901 --> 02:13:11,320
you can't.
You literally can't do this legally,

2747
02:13:11,370 --> 02:13:14,200
like legally can't do this.
I can't say it's okay to do this.

2748
02:13:14,201 --> 02:13:19,201
We can't talk about the same things that
we were going to talk in front of your 

2749
02:13:19,201 --> 02:13:22,141
kick and create.
Like if you have your kid on stage and 

2750
02:13:22,141 --> 02:13:24,220
Doug wants to talk about anal vibrators 
and like it's the hardest he's ever come

2751
02:13:24,530 --> 02:13:26,070
and the,
the,

2752
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:29,890
the Gal was drowning and gagging,
but it felt so good.

2753
02:13:29,891 --> 02:13:32,250
He's like,
how long does it take before

2754
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:34,920
you can resuscitate someone with no 
brain damage?

2755
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:38,730
Like what if she blacks out from all the
comments coming out because there's this

2756
02:13:39,570 --> 02:13:42,690
vibrator back in front of his kid.
I don't want to.

2757
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:45,750
Let me get the point and let's go back 
to this please,

2758
02:13:45,810 --> 02:13:48,550
because Olivia grace,
when she was down in Brisbane,

2759
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:53,900
she said she was there that night when 
Brian Hennigan was scouring the audience

2760
02:13:54,091 --> 02:13:56,570
for female comics.
She's lost.

2761
02:13:56,870 --> 02:13:59,580
She's very boyish.
She has a very short haircut.

2762
02:13:59,581 --> 02:14:01,770
She's very boyish and he say,
no,

2763
02:14:01,771 --> 02:14:04,080
we need female comedians,
comedians,

2764
02:14:04,280 --> 02:14:06,150
and he,
he tapped her and he went,

2765
02:14:06,810 --> 02:14:08,930
not,
you moved on.

2766
02:14:09,350 --> 02:14:11,040
You're a piece of shit.

2767
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:16,740
Olivia,
if I did that,

2768
02:14:16,741 --> 02:14:19,140
a discredited.
If there's a better story,

2769
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:22,980
should have brought her out.
You're fired anyway.

2770
02:14:23,490 --> 02:14:25,260
From the production of the end of the 
world part two.

2771
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:27,330
Um,
let's do another one when you want to do

2772
02:14:27,340 --> 02:14:28,590
it.
We have to find.

2773
02:14:28,591 --> 02:14:30,480
I've been looking for it since you said 
that.

2774
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:35,960
Let's do in January was due at the 
comedy store in January and let's just 

2775
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:37,460
find some random Tuesday.
It bitch.

2776
02:14:38,100 --> 02:14:41,340
Shut the fuck up.
Who let this guy talk?

2777
02:14:41,670 --> 02:14:45,900
It'd be good if you had somebody to 
swimming or some blacks.

2778
02:14:46,770 --> 02:14:50,490
Do you have any people of color?
We can visit the podcast,

2779
02:14:54,040 --> 02:14:55,800
which.
Oh listen,

2780
02:14:55,801 --> 02:14:58,140
you're not adopted to America.
You're influencing art.

2781
02:14:58,170 --> 02:14:58,800
How dare you?

2782
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:04,280
That's due to the nursery of the dod.
Perhaps we should make this podcast 

2783
02:15:06,731 --> 02:15:08,850
comprised with.
Sure.

2784
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:15,060
Sure.
You just want to be in Islamophobia.

2785
02:15:25,530 --> 02:15:30,070
It's gonna be on Youtube.
Don't want to ruin the desert.

2786
02:15:31,940 --> 02:15:36,940
New ideas in the middle of the desert.
We need equal parts,

2787
02:15:40,871 --> 02:15:44,050
vaginas and credences.
Doesn't matter if one of you are.

2788
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:47,140
Come on.
We got to avoid criticism at all costs.

2789
02:15:47,141 --> 02:15:47,270
Last

2790
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:50,360
I again,
I take credit.

2791
02:15:50,361 --> 02:15:52,560
I was probably the one who said it.
No.

2792
02:15:52,690 --> 02:15:54,170
Say it's my fault.
I fucked up.

2793
02:15:54,171 --> 02:15:55,640
I shouldn't talk to everybody 
beforehand.

2794
02:15:56,180 --> 02:16:01,180
There was no option to talk to the 
security guards and said don't let 

2795
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:02,660
anybody back here and no one gets on 
stage unless doug and I say yes.

2796
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:05,390
Tell Hannigan shut the fuck up.
I know.

2797
02:16:05,690 --> 02:16:08,930
Only from hearing secondhand.
Even though I was there,

2798
02:16:08,931 --> 02:16:12,250
I knew there was whatever that girl was.
There was a Santana.

2799
02:16:12,590 --> 02:16:14,600
Morgan Murphy was already.
He's amazing.

2800
02:16:15,320 --> 02:16:18,980
He doesn't look down on like Sarah Tiana
too.

2801
02:16:18,981 --> 02:16:22,760
I wasn't there when the issue happened,
but she apparently had some issue and it

2802
02:16:22,761 --> 02:16:24,140
was,
it was a non.

2803
02:16:24,250 --> 02:16:27,830
It was done.
It was all not a humorous discussion.

2804
02:16:28,070 --> 02:16:33,070
It was like a sincere know how bad it 
was that Donald Trump was going to win 

2805
02:16:33,070 --> 02:16:37,141
and how bad it was for women because it 
was right after the grab them by the 

2806
02:16:37,141 --> 02:16:37,960
Pussy video or audio.

2807
02:16:38,290 --> 02:16:40,120
So there was a lot of shit going on,
you know,

2808
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:42,700
I wasn't there.
I'd gone to the other room.

2809
02:16:42,701 --> 02:16:45,280
I did a set in the or and I came back 
and everybody's like,

2810
02:16:45,281 --> 02:16:46,820
Oh man,
you missed his crazy blowout.

2811
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:51,840
But she and Bill Burr and Sarah Tiana.
That's my point is that is not a 

2812
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:56,550
negative or a deficit.
If there's huge blown up conflict and 

2813
02:16:56,821 --> 02:17:01,821
the broadcast people.
Actually that's not what we planned.

2814
02:17:02,050 --> 02:17:07,050
You're right.
People will click on it because they 

2815
02:17:07,050 --> 02:17:09,451
heard at some point there is a big blow 
out as long as we can keep Sarah Tiana 

2816
02:17:09,581 --> 02:17:14,581
off twitter for a couple of weeks.
I definitely don't know or I don't want 

2817
02:17:14,581 --> 02:17:19,291
this to her,
but I mean reading the people that had 

2818
02:17:19,291 --> 02:17:21,811
commented on it,
like some of the people were like 

2819
02:17:21,811 --> 02:17:21,811
particularly fucking mean when they 
commented on it.

2820
02:17:21,811 --> 02:17:22,110
I'm like,
okay,

2821
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:23,380
okay.
Everybody relax.

2822
02:17:23,800 --> 02:17:25,060
Bingo.
Put out a book.

2823
02:17:25,810 --> 02:17:27,470
It's not a book.
It's a.

2824
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:32,520
She won her first mental institution 
stay when she was 50 1:50

2825
02:17:32,750 --> 02:17:36,460
against her will when she was hardcore.
Crazy before we get together.

2826
02:17:37,030 --> 02:17:42,030
She wrote like a Anne Frank Diary in the
moment of what's going on and she put 

2827
02:17:42,461 --> 02:17:47,461
that out as a book or Anne Frank's diary
and you know,

2828
02:17:47,890 --> 02:17:52,890
Bingo.
She's a soft touch and you can't read 

2829
02:17:52,890 --> 02:17:52,890
comments.
Oh yeah,

2830
02:17:52,890 --> 02:17:55,060
you're not strong enough people on the 
Internet.

2831
02:17:55,061 --> 02:17:57,400
This is going to be someone who's a 
fucking ass hole,

2832
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:01,180
so just don't go there.
She does.

2833
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:05,120
Eventually someone's going to be a 
fucking cock sucker and you're not going

2834
02:18:05,121 --> 02:18:07,180
to be able to handle it.
You're not like us.

2835
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:12,840
I have a hard to.
I won't look at fucking youtube 

2836
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:12,990
comments.
I don't want to know.

2837
02:18:13,080 --> 02:18:14,980
You know?
Well,

2838
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:17,110
it's just not.
Here's the thing.

2839
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:20,470
I wish everybody was cool and there's a.

2840
02:18:20,470 --> 02:18:25,470
there's an absolute reality when you do,
you put out as much content as you or I 

2841
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:31,860
or a lot of us is going to be some stuff
that you like and stuff that you don't 

2842
02:18:31,860 --> 02:18:32,800
like and it's just going to be styles 
you like.

2843
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:34,550
There's certain people that don't like 
someone.

2844
02:18:34,580 --> 02:18:38,350
Someone in the other day online.
I showed a picture of me and Dave attell

2845
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:39,790
and they're like,
fuck that guy.

2846
02:18:39,791 --> 02:18:40,690
He's never funny.
I'm like,

2847
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:44,260
Oh my God,
you can exist.

2848
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:45,940
I'm not.
I don't think you should die,

2849
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:48,160
but I can't talk to you.
I just can't.

2850
02:18:48,220 --> 02:18:49,860
I just don't.
I don't know.

2851
02:18:49,870 --> 02:18:54,870
I just,
I got done watching David Tell for 20 

2852
02:18:54,870 --> 02:18:56,690
minutes the Improv with a half a crowd 
and I was fucking literally crying it me

2853
02:18:57,240 --> 02:18:59,410
to do comedy again.
It was wonderful.

2854
02:18:59,440 --> 02:19:01,540
It was a break.
I got to be an audience member.

2855
02:19:01,570 --> 02:19:03,850
It was amazing with somebody out there.
It was like,

2856
02:19:03,851 --> 02:19:05,110
fuck that guy.
Does he?

2857
02:19:05,350 --> 02:19:06,250
What did he say?
Fuck.

2858
02:19:06,251 --> 02:19:09,310
That guy was sitting next to me in that 
room that night,

2859
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:10,780
man.
There's no way.

2860
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:16,200
There's no way.
There was only like that might've been 

2861
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:17,260
60 people in that room and tell was 
destroying.

2862
02:19:17,470 --> 02:19:19,000
I mean destroying.
I was like,

2863
02:19:19,001 --> 02:19:21,550
you can't say fuck that guy.
If you watch that.

2864
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:24,210
It was so funny.
I.

2865
02:19:25,060 --> 02:19:28,090
It isn't often the case.
I handled the steps

2866
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:33,190
with Doug's audience.
Do you hate headphones that are hurting 

2867
02:19:33,351 --> 02:19:37,880
my fucking ears?
She gets can swap out fucking sweat.

2868
02:19:38,260 --> 02:19:42,440
Is it the case that there's somebody 
who's like,

2869
02:19:42,441 --> 02:19:47,441
one of Doug's fans who's like,
I'm helping Joe by saying get rid of 

2870
02:19:47,441 --> 02:19:50,340
that guy because I just want to hear a 
few gaps.

2871
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:53,420
The problem with the last comic standing
is people go,

2872
02:19:53,690 --> 02:19:56,210
oh,
you're a way better than so and so.

2873
02:19:56,211 --> 02:19:59,960
It's not a competition,
and should they do that in your face?

2874
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:05,200
But they'll do it to you.
They'll walk right up to you and go so 

2875
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:07,670
much funnier than that guy.
The guy that you brought out of your own

2876
02:20:07,671 --> 02:20:12,671
pocket because you thought that this guy
should be known to your audience.

2877
02:20:13,970 --> 02:20:16,880
They act like this opening act was 
forced upon,

2878
02:20:16,881 --> 02:20:21,881
you know,
I brought him out of my own pocket 

2879
02:20:21,881 --> 02:20:24,221
because I thought you would enjoy him 
and he needs to be seen and you're 

2880
02:20:24,411 --> 02:20:25,100
fucking.

2881
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:26,960
I like that you do that.
You do that.

2882
02:20:26,961 --> 02:20:29,120
Like I do that.
I think that's super important.

2883
02:20:29,190 --> 02:20:31,670
You know,
bring guys like Brendan Walsh out on the

2884
02:20:31,671 --> 02:20:35,300
road and all these dudes you bring out 
and tell people about them.

2885
02:20:35,930 --> 02:20:40,930
But that's a,
that's a big part about this era as 

2886
02:20:40,930 --> 02:20:41,960
opposed to the old arrows is that I 
think this era is more supportive.

2887
02:20:42,140 --> 02:20:44,480
There's more opportunities so people 
don't feel famine,

2888
02:20:44,920 --> 02:20:45,680
you know,
don't feel like,

2889
02:20:45,681 --> 02:20:50,681
oh,
we one guard can be the host of the 

2890
02:20:50,681 --> 02:20:50,681
tonight show.
But that's not a thing anymore.

2891
02:20:50,890 --> 02:20:52,490
Like if somebody offered me the tonight 
show,

2892
02:20:52,491 --> 02:20:55,100
I'd be like,
what do you want me to do?

2893
02:20:55,480 --> 02:20:59,030
You want me to go and fucking talk about
shit I don't want to talk about for like

2894
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:00,440
how,
how,

2895
02:21:00,590 --> 02:21:02,510
what do you think happens if you make 
more money?

2896
02:21:02,540 --> 02:21:04,520
We didn't have Ferguson last night.

2897
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:09,760
Ferguson,
where the line is a segment where the 

2898
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:09,760
riots took place.
No,

2899
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:09,920
no.
Craig Ferguson.

2900
02:21:09,921 --> 02:21:13,010
We did his podcast last night and I told
him,

2901
02:21:13,011 --> 02:21:16,010
I go,
I hated you when I first saw you because

2902
02:21:16,011 --> 02:21:19,850
I don't watch late night.
But if I was flipping channels and I saw

2903
02:21:19,851 --> 02:21:24,420
you for a minute with your accent and 
getting your face into that like Fisheye

2904
02:21:24,470 --> 02:21:29,470
lens thing he would do in his monologue.
I didn't like you until I heard you on 

2905
02:21:29,470 --> 02:21:33,821
stern and I all of a sudden he was a 
human being for an hour and 20 minutes.

2906
02:21:34,401 --> 02:21:37,550
He's a guy with good stories and he 
hated.

2907
02:21:37,710 --> 02:21:42,710
He is like no one would accept the fact 
that he did not want to do anything 

2908
02:21:43,311 --> 02:21:45,140
else.
They're offering them other projects.

2909
02:21:45,141 --> 02:21:45,600
He's like,
no,

2910
02:21:45,601 --> 02:21:46,130
I'm,
I'm good.

2911
02:21:46,131 --> 02:21:47,240
I'm done.
Well,

2912
02:21:47,250 --> 02:21:48,010
you know,
holly,

2913
02:21:48,011 --> 02:21:49,630
we quit.
Quit.

2914
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:54,720
I mean nothing.
That's the greatest thing about his 

2915
02:21:54,720 --> 02:21:54,720
decision making.

2916
02:21:54,720 --> 02:21:54,920
Like he's like,
I don't want to do this anymore.

2917
02:21:54,990 --> 02:21:58,430
Now he does stand up and he just did a 
Netflix special and he's doing a podcast

2918
02:21:58,431 --> 02:21:59,840
because he goes,
I got to do something.

2919
02:22:00,130 --> 02:22:03,440
I didn't want to talk,
but I don't want to do it by their rules

2920
02:22:03,441 --> 02:22:08,441
and no one believes when you don't have 
that Kinda half the through line of the 

2921
02:22:09,141 --> 02:22:11,960
book is when you,
I want to do what I do,

2922
02:22:11,961 --> 02:22:16,820
but no one buys that.
You don't need to be more famous.

2923
02:22:17,030 --> 02:22:18,420
I don't.
I,

2924
02:22:18,421 --> 02:22:23,421
uh,
I did to plant little of eggplant and I 

2925
02:22:24,051 --> 02:22:26,430
don't like it.
I know I don't want more

2926
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:27,510
excellence.
Delicious.

2927
02:22:28,860 --> 02:22:33,780
With stevie on it,
fucking eggplant Parmesan.

2928
02:22:34,140 --> 02:22:39,140
One time my mother tried to make it and 
it was so grotesque that when she's 

2929
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:40,680
saying you got to eat it,
and then when she tried it,

2930
02:22:40,681 --> 02:22:41,250
she goes,
all right,

2931
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:43,080
I'll give.
Give me all your plates.

2932
02:22:43,081 --> 02:22:44,980
This came out bad.
Sorry.

2933
02:22:45,180 --> 02:22:50,180
Well maybe that's what it was.
Maybe if you went to Trenton yonkers or 

2934
02:22:50,180 --> 02:22:51,360
something like that.
If you don't like a little bit of fame,

2935
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:54,750
you know you're not going to like a lot.
So it's not like.

2936
02:22:54,980 --> 02:22:56,670
Well yeah,
I think you like a little bit.

2937
02:22:56,730 --> 02:23:00,300
Let's be a little bit and I think a 
little bit is good.

2938
02:23:00,510 --> 02:23:05,510
I think it's all good as long as the 
numbers and manageable and you can stay 

2939
02:23:05,510 --> 02:23:06,360
yourself.
I think the real problems when you go.

2940
02:23:06,780 --> 02:23:08,430
Look,
here's the best example,

2941
02:23:08,850 --> 02:23:13,850
Michael Jackson who has never been a 
better example in the world of toxicity 

2942
02:23:13,850 --> 02:23:14,970
due to celebrity status.

2943
02:23:15,240 --> 02:23:19,680
Like you hit critical levels.
You hit some three mile island shit.

2944
02:23:19,740 --> 02:23:24,740
You hit some Chernobyl shit.
It's impossible to maintain the amount 

2945
02:23:24,740 --> 02:23:26,760
of energy that's coming your way as a 
normal human being.

2946
02:23:27,020 --> 02:23:32,020
I mean,
you don't have any unique DNA that 

2947
02:23:32,020 --> 02:23:34,371
allows you to deal with the idea that 
300 million people know who you are or 

2948
02:23:34,371 --> 02:23:39,321
more Jackson Swath of your clothing Dna 
out and put it in a petri dish and make 

2949
02:23:41,401 --> 02:23:46,401
a fucking cloning it and frame it and 
put it in their man cave and there's a 

2950
02:23:46,401 --> 02:23:50,631
bunch of people to think that maybe 
you're molesting kids and you've got to 

2951
02:23:50,631 --> 02:23:53,071
fucking amusement park in the backyard 
and you're literally losing your mind 

2952
02:23:53,071 --> 02:23:53,071
and you tell a guy,
hey man,

2953
02:23:53,071 --> 02:23:57,591
I can't sleep.
I want you to analysts anesthetize me 

2954
02:23:57,591 --> 02:23:58,530
every night in a fucking tube.
Just put,

2955
02:23:58,850 --> 02:24:02,940
put me in some fucking crazy hyperbaric 
chamber and pumping the gas.

2956
02:24:03,150 --> 02:24:08,150
I mean,
this guy was off the fucking 

2957
02:24:08,150 --> 02:24:08,150
reservation.
There had never been anybody that famous

2958
02:24:08,150 --> 02:24:11,760
before.
He was literally the guy with the candle

2959
02:24:11,761 --> 02:24:14,760
at the end of the universe going,
oh my God,

2960
02:24:14,761 --> 02:24:15,810
I think there's.
Keep.

2961
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:19,110
See there's more room.
There's no one's ever been here before.

2962
02:24:19,290 --> 02:24:21,120
No one's ever been that famous.
What happened?

2963
02:24:21,210 --> 02:24:25,260
He went crazy.
He went completely insane and died young

2964
02:24:25,560 --> 02:24:30,060
and no,
and nowhere between 1990 and 2017.

2965
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:32,550
Does it look like any of what's happened
to him is manageable?

2966
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:37,700
It's like he's running down a hill,
like tumbling down a hill and he's okay 

2967
02:24:37,700 --> 02:24:39,750
for the first decade.
Maybe the first two decades.

2968
02:24:39,970 --> 02:24:43,200
After awhile he's just getting chewed 
the fuck up psychologically.

2969
02:24:43,201 --> 02:24:45,950
Physically he keeps getting more plastic
surgery.

2970
02:24:46,470 --> 02:24:50,690
I don't think he was ever very stable.
Psychologic.

2971
02:24:50,691 --> 02:24:52,140
Oh No,
I don't think so either.

2972
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:52,950
I mean,
I don't know,

2973
02:24:52,951 --> 02:24:54,900
but if you ever seen that document 
around them,

2974
02:24:54,901 --> 02:24:56,480
it's fucking love.

2975
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:59,610
That documentary is the first time.
This is it.

2976
02:24:59,790 --> 02:25:00,540
This is it.
Yeah,

2977
02:25:00,541 --> 02:25:02,220
it's amazing.
Earlier again,

2978
02:25:02,221 --> 02:25:05,160
I don't know.
Music to watch that you go,

2979
02:25:05,220 --> 02:25:10,220
oh,
this guy really didn't know what the 

2980
02:25:10,220 --> 02:25:10,220
fuck you was doing.
I just don't get it.

2981
02:25:10,220 --> 02:25:12,510
He was really brilliant.
I just think the songs suck.

2982
02:25:12,700 --> 02:25:17,700
Well they suck,
but in terms of like what you want to 

2983
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:17,700
hear right now,
look,

2984
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:19,740
everything requires context.
Right?

2985
02:25:20,010 --> 02:25:23,100
Like if you were.
Do you remember when I was a kid,

2986
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:28,320
and I remember this really clearly 
because I was in high school and I was 

2987
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:28,320
living at home and I was listening to 
Debbie,

2988
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,530
a C O Z in Boston?
No.

2989
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:32,440
W fnx.
No,

2990
02:25:33,700 --> 02:25:34,660
no way.
Jose.

2991
02:25:34,661 --> 02:25:37,030
That was right.
WC O Z and Boston.

2992
02:25:37,031 --> 02:25:42,031
It was a radio station in Boston in 19 
eighties is rock and roll station and 

2993
02:25:42,031 --> 02:25:42,400
the guy came on who was a DJ.

2994
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:47,400
I wish I could remember.
It wasn't mark Parenteau who's like the 

2995
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:49,300
big ones in the morning,
but the guy came on.

2996
02:25:49,301 --> 02:25:53,530
He played Michael Jackson.
He played a Michael Jackson Song.

2997
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:55,390
Yeah,
I think it was beat it and he said,

2998
02:25:55,391 --> 02:25:56,560
look,
I know this.

2999
02:25:56,561 --> 02:25:57,850
No,
he played Billie Jean.

3000
02:25:58,120 --> 02:26:03,120
He goes,
I know this isn't rock and roll because 

3001
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:03,120
it's so good.
I have to play.

3002
02:26:03,130 --> 02:26:08,130
And he played it and he played billy 
Jean and I remember it was no twitter 

3003
02:26:08,130 --> 02:26:09,280
back their book and with this anchor 
music.

3004
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:12,190
Well not only that,
this guy was a real dj.

3005
02:26:12,191 --> 02:26:14,200
He was like one of the last of the real 
djs.

3006
02:26:14,380 --> 02:26:16,480
They could literally decide,
hey,

3007
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:18,970
I just heard this man Jack Umay.
Yeah,

3008
02:26:18,971 --> 02:26:23,971
this Lou Reed record that you fuckers 
have to hear from the beginning to the 

3009
02:26:23,971 --> 02:26:27,961
end.
I want you to listen from the beginning 

3010
02:26:27,961 --> 02:26:27,961
to the end,
so I'm going to play this.

3011
02:26:27,961 --> 02:26:32,130
You know,
you hear Bruce springsteen when he was 

3012
02:26:32,130 --> 02:26:32,130
like 30,
you know,

3013
02:26:32,130 --> 02:26:34,240
like beginning to the end,
you know,

3014
02:26:34,660 --> 02:26:39,660
those days should do that.
He used to sit there and listen and 

3015
02:26:39,660 --> 02:26:41,980
you'd be he that doesn't exist anymore 
like that and there's too many.

3016
02:26:42,310 --> 02:26:44,500
This is one of the problems with money,
right?

3017
02:26:44,501 --> 02:26:49,501
There's problems with trademarks and the
ability to put things on youtube and 

3018
02:26:49,501 --> 02:26:49,770
whether or not you can get credit for 
this or put that up,

3019
02:26:49,771 --> 02:26:54,771
but that up like a radio station if just
wanting to appear right now and pr and 

3020
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:58,090
do like that kind of a thing.
It probably be almost impossible.

3021
02:26:58,120 --> 02:27:03,120
Like how many radio stations are there 
in the world where they would let you 

3022
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:05,641
just play a whole brief bruce 
springsteen album from the beginning to 

3023
02:27:05,641 --> 02:27:06,400
the end.
Terrestrial radio at this point

3024
02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:11,720
probably play child porn.
Just soundtracks and no one's listening 

3025
02:27:11,881 --> 02:27:16,881
anymore.
Do you still do like no uber in the 

3026
02:27:16,881 --> 02:27:18,440
morning when you have to promote a Gig?
I don't have.

3027
02:27:18,450 --> 02:27:19,980
I don't,
but I miss some people.

3028
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:24,530
I Miss Kevin and being johnny dare in 
Kansas City.

3029
02:27:24,550 --> 02:27:26,190
Ms Dot that guy.
He's like,

3030
02:27:26,210 --> 02:27:28,260
you didn't have to do it,
but Johnny Darren,

3031
02:27:28,290 --> 02:27:32,040
I have enough of the history.
So when I went to Kansas City,

3032
02:27:32,041 --> 02:27:33,720
I got there the night before.
I said,

3033
02:27:33,721 --> 02:27:36,000
all right,
if I wake up at 6:00

3034
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:36,810
AM,
which I did,

3035
02:27:37,860 --> 02:27:42,860
and we went down just for fun and we 
took over morning radio and Johnny dare 

3036
02:27:44,310 --> 02:27:46,260
in passing.
He's like,

3037
02:27:46,320 --> 02:27:49,620
he knows my house is all weird.
So he's showing me pictures of his house

3038
02:27:49,621 --> 02:27:52,290
and he's got all sorts of fucked up 
weird kind of things.

3039
02:27:52,291 --> 02:27:52,650
And

3040
02:27:56,100 --> 02:27:58,230
what's his name?
Patrick Mcgee.

3041
02:27:58,750 --> 02:28:01,070
Oh,
like,

3042
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:02,410
no.
I go,

3043
02:28:02,450 --> 02:28:03,060
uh,
my,

3044
02:28:03,260 --> 02:28:06,360
my tour manager Greg Jaylee does ghost 
ride.

3045
02:28:06,361 --> 02:28:08,400
He goes to all this shit came from ghost
ride.

3046
02:28:08,401 --> 02:28:10,410
I go to the St Louis.
Yeah.

3047
02:28:10,411 --> 02:28:15,411
That's the second time now that a 
morning radio guy like Joe Rogan morning

3048
02:28:15,780 --> 02:28:20,780
ready me,
my hennessy's over their breeding 

3049
02:28:20,780 --> 02:28:20,780
Hennessy.
Well,

3050
02:28:20,780 --> 02:28:21,920
no,
actually I was just checking up on it.

3051
02:28:21,990 --> 02:28:26,990
I was just reading the comments and 
seeing if we should also start against 

3052
02:28:26,990 --> 02:28:30,580
bringing more diversity.
I've got a few African students who 

3053
02:28:30,580 --> 02:28:30,740
would like to have in the studio for the
record.

3054
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:34,420
Hennigan is not technically a guest.
His name is Hennessy,

3055
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:39,700
but when,
when Hennessy's wearing a guest on my 

3056
02:28:39,700 --> 02:28:40,760
podcast,
he does the same thing.

3057
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:46,000
He'll sit there and fucking read your 
laptop while you're a guest.

3058
02:28:46,580 --> 02:28:48,270
You can't do that shit,
bitch.

3059
02:28:48,410 --> 02:28:50,690
I just wanted to look at these.
He was fine.

3060
02:28:50,690 --> 02:28:52,740
He was tweeting.
Was looking at the uh,

3061
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:57,880
because I remember noticing this before 
somebody edited out the best of Bill 

3062
02:28:58,460 --> 02:29:02,900
Burr on the podcast election night as a 
standalone video.

3063
02:29:02,901 --> 02:29:05,180
Yeah.
It's got 900,000

3064
02:29:05,210 --> 02:29:08,270
views.
Just the best of bilberry smashed it.

3065
02:29:08,680 --> 02:29:11,480
He smashed it.
It was so perfect for him because he had

3066
02:29:11,481 --> 02:29:14,450
got his fucking held it up.
It was awesome,

3067
02:29:14,480 --> 02:29:16,820
but it was great to have all will keep 
coming in.

3068
02:29:17,080 --> 02:29:18,770
Do you have a great lesson?
You got it.

3069
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:21,560
You and I have been friends for so long.
I knew what you were going through.

3070
02:29:21,561 --> 02:29:23,270
I was like,
I just don't know what to do.

3071
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:26,810
I didn't know how to handle it.
I didn't know to joke around with.

3072
02:29:26,950 --> 02:29:30,260
I was trying to bail a lot of it.
Before the coma.

3073
02:29:30,800 --> 02:29:31,890
I was saying,
I don't.

3074
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:35,000
I don't think I'm the guy for the job.
You're like,

3075
02:29:35,030 --> 02:29:36,530
fuck you,
you're coming to la.

3076
02:29:37,160 --> 02:29:39,170
So then when the seizure happened,
I go,

3077
02:29:39,290 --> 02:29:42,290
he's to think that her coma is an 
excuse,

3078
02:29:44,010 --> 02:29:47,720
but I've always been a about Marilyn 
Manson backstage with a golf shirt on or

3079
02:29:47,721 --> 02:29:48,530
something.
Oh my God.

3080
02:29:48,531 --> 02:29:53,531
He showed up.
He showed up like the end of the movie 

3081
02:29:54,621 --> 02:29:59,621
flight,
which is the best ending to a movie 

3082
02:29:59,621 --> 02:30:02,081
ever.
That's the Denzel Washington where he 

3083
02:30:02,081 --> 02:30:03,830
crashes the plane,
but he saves the entire crew like holly.

3084
02:30:04,210 --> 02:30:05,530
Right?
Last,

3085
02:30:05,870 --> 02:30:10,870
but he was fine.
He was jacked and fucked in the movie 

3086
02:30:10,870 --> 02:30:13,580
and at the end he's drunk as shit and 
John Goodman,

3087
02:30:13,610 --> 02:30:18,610
his drug dealer comes in and fixes them 
with cocaine so he can testify it's the 

3088
02:30:20,270 --> 02:30:25,270
best ending of a movie or that movie.
Watch the beginning and then fast 

3089
02:30:25,270 --> 02:30:29,831
forward through the fluff in the middle 
and get to the end and it's one of the 

3090
02:30:29,831 --> 02:30:33,161
best Madsen showed up where there's amy 
takedowns beginning.

3091
02:30:35,650 --> 02:30:40,650
They said our toad artois art.
There's a giant picture in Johnny's 

3092
02:30:40,650 --> 02:30:45,641
house where I'm staring at this.
It looks like Manson and I fuck Manson.

3093
02:30:46,340 --> 02:30:51,340
As weird and unstable as he is is the 
only guy I can think of that would 

3094
02:30:53,931 --> 02:30:57,230
understand where I am right now,
why I'm here,

3095
02:30:57,380 --> 02:30:59,150
how fucked I am,
what's going on,

3096
02:30:59,151 --> 02:31:01,100
and I called him and he answered his 
phone,

3097
02:31:01,101 --> 02:31:03,830
which he never answers his phone at 5:30
at night,

3098
02:31:03,860 --> 02:31:08,630
which is morning for him and I told him 
what's going on.

3099
02:31:08,631 --> 02:31:10,970
He said,
I'll be there in 30 minutes,

3100
02:31:11,090 --> 02:31:16,090
and he showed up with Krispy kremes and 
cocaine and each problem,

3101
02:31:17,660 --> 02:31:20,220
and then he showed up and he sat 
backstage.

3102
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:25,340
He wouldn't come out onstage and once 
were I was beckoning for to come out.

3103
02:31:25,650 --> 02:31:30,650
That's when his management people caught
wind of the fact that he's about to go 

3104
02:31:30,811 --> 02:31:33,930
out and his handler had to drag him 
away,

3105
02:31:33,931 --> 02:31:37,230
but he saved my fucking life that night.
Whereas fucking handlers,

3106
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:42,260
who knows we need to talk to them that 
tell them they'll be relaxed right now.

3107
02:31:43,290 --> 02:31:46,050
Re lacks.
Settle down.

3108
02:31:46,051 --> 02:31:51,051
You're,
you're handling Maryland motherfucking 

3109
02:31:51,051 --> 02:31:51,051
Manson.
Okay.

3110
02:31:51,051 --> 02:31:51,360
Alright.
There you go.

3111
02:31:51,390 --> 02:31:53,430
It's not Jim Nabors.
Okay.

3112
02:31:53,820 --> 02:31:58,110
You just lose one of them guys that are 
actually still doing rock and roll guy.

3113
02:31:58,140 --> 02:31:59,940
Really doing it.
God you.

3114
02:31:59,941 --> 02:32:01,230
They just want to.
What do they want to do?

3115
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:06,260
Keep him out of legal trouble.
Keep them alive to get the fuck out of 

3116
02:32:06,260 --> 02:32:06,810
here.
You need like a secondary version.

3117
02:32:06,811 --> 02:32:11,811
You need to like,
like guys who are lawyers who were on 

3118
02:32:11,811 --> 02:32:15,480
adderall and they report to the lawyers 
who are sober or give like two filters.

3119
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:20,500
You know,
dudes like understand people on coke 

3120
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:21,900
because they're basically on like some 
sort of synthetic coke and then you have

3121
02:32:21,901 --> 02:32:26,901
a report like they have.
There were like police body cameras and 

3122
02:32:26,901 --> 02:32:28,350
they report to the lawyers who are sober
get drug tested every day.

3123
02:32:28,810 --> 02:32:30,350
I'm like okay,
what exactly was going on?

3124
02:32:30,351 --> 02:32:32,480
And everybody be like,
everybody has a say and they,

3125
02:32:32,481 --> 02:32:34,050
they been count together and they go,
what?

3126
02:32:34,360 --> 02:32:35,910
How do we,
how do we handle this?

3127
02:32:35,911 --> 02:32:40,911
Well,
we handle this by the fact that we're 

3128
02:32:40,911 --> 02:32:40,911
handling,

3129
02:32:40,911 --> 02:32:40,911
man,
I'm fucking Manson.

3130
02:32:40,911 --> 02:32:41,690
Let them do it.
Let them go.

3131
02:32:41,691 --> 02:32:46,691
Give him the gun.
Gave him the rubber gloves by the 

3132
02:32:46,691 --> 02:32:46,691
rubber.

3133
02:32:46,930 --> 02:32:49,300
He's such a sweet dude.
Yeah,

3134
02:32:49,330 --> 02:32:51,610
he's a very nice guy.
I met him a couple of times.

3135
02:32:51,611 --> 02:32:54,250
He's always been very friendly,
like genuinely friendly.

3136
02:32:54,580 --> 02:32:58,450
Sorry I turned that on.
I've got to show you a picture.

3137
02:32:58,451 --> 02:33:03,451
I can't wait to tweet this right.
That you shut off your phone like a 

3138
02:33:03,451 --> 02:33:03,451
gentleman.
Plus,

3139
02:33:03,451 --> 02:33:07,510
I like the fact that your phone makes us
starting noise from 2006.

3140
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:13,200
What is that?
One of them sound and Samson used to 

3141
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:15,310
bust my balls because I was the last guy
with a flip phone.

3142
02:33:15,311 --> 02:33:20,311
So depressing and you'd have all the new
gadgetry and I was so proud to have a 

3143
02:33:20,311 --> 02:33:22,930
flip phone,
but when we started working in the UK,

3144
02:33:23,500 --> 02:33:28,090
nobody calls everyone only texts because
I guess phone calls,

3145
02:33:28,091 --> 02:33:31,120
cost of fucking thousand pounds a minute
or something.

3146
02:33:31,480 --> 02:33:36,480
So I had to actually get a smart phone,
but I still long for the flip phone days

3147
02:33:37,390 --> 02:33:39,850
will samsung just came out with a new 
phone that's a hybrid.

3148
02:33:39,850 --> 02:33:44,850
It's a combination of a smartphone and a
flip phone and you open it up and you 

3149
02:33:44,850 --> 02:33:48,640
can get an actual keyboard and he talked
to people just like a regular flip phone

3150
02:33:48,670 --> 02:33:53,290
and when you're done you hang it up and 
the front of the phone is a Bezel.

3151
02:33:53,291 --> 02:33:55,600
Lists smartphone.
So the front of the phone?

3152
02:33:56,380 --> 02:33:57,820
Yeah.
Like you could do text messages,

3153
02:33:57,821 --> 02:34:02,821
you can view the Internet and then when 
you want to open it up and make phone 

3154
02:34:02,821 --> 02:34:04,840
calls that acts like a regular old 
school flip phone and people really like

3155
02:34:04,841 --> 02:34:09,841
it.
In terms of like pressing physical 

3156
02:34:09,841 --> 02:34:09,841
buttons.
Yes.

3157
02:34:09,841 --> 02:34:12,810
Yeah.
Have you seen you watch a movie on your 

3158
02:34:12,810 --> 02:34:13,720
fucking smart phone?
I know people that have a busy,

3159
02:34:13,721 --> 02:34:18,721
they don't have cable.
That's why football is popular at my 

3160
02:34:18,721 --> 02:34:18,721
house because no one has

3161
02:34:18,721 --> 02:34:21,760
tv so they can't watch it unless they 
come to my house.

3162
02:34:21,970 --> 02:34:26,970
But I know people that watch,
they'll just sit and watch an entire 

3163
02:34:26,970 --> 02:34:27,280
movie on a phone.
Right?

3164
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:30,890
I can't watch it on a 32 inch screen.
I.

3165
02:34:30,950 --> 02:34:33,340
I need a big fucking screen and watch a 
movie.

3166
02:34:33,430 --> 02:34:34,600
Yeah.
I think 100 percent.

3167
02:34:34,601 --> 02:34:36,490
And I go.
The only time that there's that phone,

3168
02:34:36,730 --> 02:34:38,740
the only time is when you're on a plane 
or something,

3169
02:34:38,741 --> 02:34:40,030
you're trapped and all you have is your 
phone.

3170
02:34:40,031 --> 02:34:42,190
Look at that phone doug.
Look at that screen.

3171
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:47,530
So the front of it is 60 inches.
That will be an awkward phone call.

3172
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:50,650
You can't carry that around Bro.
You don't even understand inches,

3173
02:34:50,651 --> 02:34:55,651
bro.
That's a the size of like an iphone six 

3174
02:34:55,651 --> 02:35:00,121
or some shit.
Actually it was a little bigger than 

3175
02:35:00,121 --> 02:35:00,121
that.
Doesn't jammies with how big is it?

3176
02:35:00,121 --> 02:35:02,170
Is a big screen.
I had it on another page.

3177
02:35:02,400 --> 02:35:07,400
This is when I had to decide which 
picture goes in the book in which 

3178
02:35:07,400 --> 02:35:07,840
doesn't cause there's too many dick 
pics.

3179
02:35:08,770 --> 02:35:12,550
I deleted this and put in the me pulling
my dick out in front of Louis Ck.

3180
02:35:12,551 --> 02:35:14,680
But I can't wait to tweet this.
Let me see that.

3181
02:35:16,570 --> 02:35:18,670
I have to apologize.
I was wrong.

3182
02:35:19,640 --> 02:35:24,090
You touched it wrong.
I didn't touch you that Jesus Christ his

3183
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:25,910
angry.
By the way,

3184
02:35:25,930 --> 02:35:28,030
this is a bad touch.
Touch Rogan.

3185
02:35:28,031 --> 02:35:29,450
GotTa ramp.
The thing up here.

3186
02:35:29,610 --> 02:35:30,310
Yeah,
we.

3187
02:35:30,420 --> 02:35:32,710
Are we out?
Are we going towards A.

3188
02:35:35,170 --> 02:35:36,760
Yeah.
I pulled my dick out in front of her,

3189
02:35:36,761 --> 02:35:39,250
but what about the three or four people 
in between?

3190
02:35:39,550 --> 02:35:41,740
Everybody seems okay with it.
Yeah.

3191
02:35:41,741 --> 02:35:43,630
That was back when I was kind of my 
thing.

3192
02:35:43,631 --> 02:35:45,280
Sarah Silvermans there.
She's now.

3193
02:35:45,300 --> 02:35:47,760
That's the ask.
Did you ask first?

3194
02:35:47,800 --> 02:35:48,280
No,
no.

3195
02:35:48,281 --> 02:35:50,830
I was vacation telling them picture I 
was fluffing.

3196
02:35:50,831 --> 02:35:52,900
But are you prepared for shame?
I'm,

3197
02:35:53,170 --> 02:35:55,000
I'm ready for it.
You might get it.

3198
02:35:55,060 --> 02:35:56,460
You wouldn't have to get this.
Um,

3199
02:35:56,770 --> 02:35:59,410
is there a place where people can view 
this or is it a good example?

3200
02:35:59,411 --> 02:36:01,220
I was going to tweet it.
Hmm.

3201
02:36:01,510 --> 02:36:02,830
Let me talk to you about this.
All right.

3202
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:04,300
Let's wait.
Let's wait.

3203
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:06,130
I've got somebody said,
Sarah Silverman.

3204
02:36:06,330 --> 02:36:11,330
Well,
Sarah Silverman is a friend and a 

3205
02:36:11,330 --> 02:36:13,111
wonderful comedian and a colleague and I
think you and I both respect her as I 

3206
02:36:13,111 --> 02:36:17,580
do.
I don't think that's what I didn't want 

3207
02:36:17,580 --> 02:36:17,580
her to get into any trouble because she 
wrote a,

3208
02:36:17,580 --> 02:36:19,030
is it okay to love Louis ck thing?

3209
02:36:19,410 --> 02:36:22,270
Is it okay to love?
Here's me with my dick out.

3210
02:36:22,570 --> 02:36:24,700
Here's the thing.
It might not be anymore.

3211
02:36:24,910 --> 02:36:27,550
This is why we need to burn that.
You need to burn your whole phone.

3212
02:36:27,800 --> 02:36:32,800
You need to get modern phone that allows
you to take photos and get online and 

3213
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:34,790
then you need to burn that thing because
you can't.

3214
02:36:34,940 --> 02:36:39,940
Can't have those pictures.
You can't have those pictures floating 

3215
02:36:39,940 --> 02:36:40,030
around.
It's important,

3216
02:36:40,031 --> 02:36:41,200
man.
I'm sorry.

3217
02:36:41,201 --> 02:36:44,140
I was the guy that put it out.
It's so sad.

3218
02:36:44,170 --> 02:36:49,170
Those are.
Those are developed pictures from a 

3219
02:36:49,170 --> 02:36:49,170
photo mat.
I think it's gonna take a little time,

3220
02:36:49,170 --> 02:36:53,821
but once,
once we get through this we're going to 

3221
02:36:53,821 --> 02:36:55,711
find some sort of a reasonable,
a agreement where when you can and 

3222
02:36:55,711 --> 02:37:00,091
cannot pull your dick out because what 
we needed to do when people are young 

3223
02:37:00,091 --> 02:37:02,710
boys and girls install a small,
like a,

3224
02:37:03,010 --> 02:37:07,600
some sort of a sexual equivalent to a 
Turkey tester or something like a,

3225
02:37:07,630 --> 02:37:08,890
like a green light,
you know,

3226
02:37:08,891 --> 02:37:11,140
like acting like goes off like,
okay,

3227
02:37:11,141 --> 02:37:14,860
you can pull your dick out now sir,
like I'm 23 years old,

3228
02:37:15,020 --> 02:37:18,560
I'd be going to college,
but that sex would pull your dick out.

3229
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:21,530
It's when you're our age that's 
inappropriate.

3230
02:37:22,190 --> 02:37:24,950
Unless they're our age two,
which you know what,

3231
02:37:25,070 --> 02:37:28,550
there's no 50 year old comics hitting on
50 year old women,

3232
02:37:29,630 --> 02:37:34,630
which is a maybe.
But like what if it's a woman like 

3233
02:37:34,630 --> 02:37:35,480
Christie Brinkley,
she's like 63.

3234
02:37:35,481 --> 02:37:37,670
She's still hot as fuck.
Well then you go,

3235
02:37:37,730 --> 02:37:40,310
oh my God,
I'm your age so I know who you are.

3236
02:37:40,311 --> 02:37:43,190
Unlike young men,
you're just happy to be there.

3237
02:37:43,191 --> 02:37:48,191
You don't pull your dick out.
I wish I did this years ago when it was 

3238
02:37:48,191 --> 02:37:52,001
erect.
How many people would be mad if a woman 

3239
02:37:52,001 --> 02:37:52,580
pulled her vagina out?
Almost zero.

3240
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:54,560
Right?
Like who would feel threatened?

3241
02:37:54,740 --> 02:37:59,740
That's the real problem.
The real problem is the physical 

3242
02:37:59,740 --> 02:38:00,050
violence potential and the number of 
people that have been raped.

3243
02:38:00,280 --> 02:38:02,900
That's the real problem because it was 
just about weird sex.

3244
02:38:02,901 --> 02:38:04,250
Things like,
well,

3245
02:38:04,251 --> 02:38:09,251
this is an which is the bit that has 
been working on is the difference 

3246
02:38:09,251 --> 02:38:11,600
between hot as fuck.
Take it or leave it.

3247
02:38:13,700 --> 02:38:14,600
Come on,
bitch.

3248
02:38:16,880 --> 02:38:21,880
Christie Brinkley does not live a human 
life in perfect lighting with perfect 

3249
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:26,130
makeup.
You don't need the dark ones with no.

3250
02:38:26,150 --> 02:38:29,390
At some point she's hunched over like I 
am with this posture,

3251
02:38:29,391 --> 02:38:31,850
wearing reading glasses thicker than 
ours.

3252
02:38:32,270 --> 02:38:37,270
Trying to focus on something on a laptop
and that spill bellies hanging over cunt

3253
02:38:38,150 --> 02:38:43,150
because eight kids came out of it.
That's when you both put on mascot masks

3254
02:38:43,220 --> 02:38:48,220
like you are the squirrel and she's the 
raccoon and you guys just fucked by the 

3255
02:38:48,220 --> 02:38:50,450
firelight.
Just get right in front of that God damn

3256
02:38:50,451 --> 02:38:55,451
fireplace and go to town,
molly and overrated because it leads to 

3257
02:38:57,081 --> 02:38:59,780
all these problems.
Certainly can.

3258
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:04,840
It certainly can lead to a like a weird 
unofficial bond with people,

3259
02:39:05,390 --> 02:39:08,180
right?
Like if everybody.

3260
02:39:08,990 --> 02:39:10,110
Imagine this,
if,

3261
02:39:10,270 --> 02:39:14,810
if like hugging people if like 
committing to hugging people was like as

3262
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:17,240
intimate as community to having sex with
people.

3263
02:39:17,620 --> 02:39:21,680
Well hugging people is really quick and 
no one says,

3264
02:39:21,770 --> 02:39:24,080
oh,
he hugged too soon.

3265
02:39:24,360 --> 02:39:25,590
He,
I was.

3266
02:39:25,710 --> 02:39:30,710
I was.
I was hoping it was going to be a long 

3267
02:39:30,710 --> 02:39:32,741
hug,
but his hug was done like in seconds 

3268
02:39:32,741 --> 02:39:34,100
like he was a teenager and his first 
hug,

3269
02:39:34,370 --> 02:39:39,370
like the man does not have the right to 
pull out of the hug before the woman 

3270
02:39:39,890 --> 02:39:42,920
wants to end the hug like the period.
We all know this.

3271
02:39:43,010 --> 02:39:45,170
Can you hug twice in a night?
No,

3272
02:39:45,230 --> 02:39:46,190
no,
don't do it.

3273
02:39:46,191 --> 02:39:49,280
Because the second hug will be 
unenthusiastic and not representative of

3274
02:39:49,281 --> 02:39:52,130
your soul who you are as a spiritual 
being.

3275
02:39:52,940 --> 02:39:55,790
You need to only hug fucking once a 
week.

3276
02:39:55,920 --> 02:39:58,970
Once asked someone you love.
Porn has changed the game.

3277
02:39:59,030 --> 02:40:04,030
Porn has ruined fucking and it's 
continuing to ruin.

3278
02:40:04,340 --> 02:40:07,580
Fucking like that.
It's just setting you up for robot.

3279
02:40:07,581 --> 02:40:09,350
Fuck dolls.
Have you seen that stripper?

3280
02:40:09,450 --> 02:40:12,010
A robot that gyrates on the.
On the,

3281
02:40:12,011 --> 02:40:13,190
uh,
the pole.

3282
02:40:13,440 --> 02:40:17,700
There's a robot that goes on the 
stripper pole and it's clearly a robot.

3283
02:40:17,701 --> 02:40:22,701
You see all the mechanical parts,
but it's moving his ass like some 

3284
02:40:22,701 --> 02:40:23,520
beautiful woman with a perfect ass.
You okay?

3285
02:40:23,521 --> 02:40:28,521
Okay.
Like we are so close to not being able 

3286
02:40:28,521 --> 02:40:31,761
to tell.
Like I don't know if we understand what 

3287
02:40:31,761 --> 02:40:32,280
exponential increases in technology are.
Look at this.

3288
02:40:32,750 --> 02:40:36,690
Lead this robot.
She's gyrating on this poll.

3289
02:40:36,691 --> 02:40:38,400
So she's holding this pole.
Okay.

3290
02:40:38,490 --> 02:40:41,370
Well right now you could see your joints
and all that stuff and I know she's done

3291
02:40:41,371 --> 02:40:43,140
a human even though she's wearing high 
heeled shoes.

3292
02:40:43,320 --> 02:40:45,660
How many more years do we have before 
that is fixed,

3293
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:46,760
but how,
how,

3294
02:40:46,830 --> 02:40:51,830
how often did you need that?
You went to see strippers because you 

3295
02:40:51,830 --> 02:40:55,761
wanted the threat of getting pussy.
You didn't need her to spin around a 

3296
02:40:55,761 --> 02:40:56,430
brass pole.

3297
02:40:56,430 --> 02:41:01,430
If she was just there vacant,
robotic and ask a sleigh and Akimbo you 

3298
02:41:04,001 --> 02:41:05,610
just fuck her,
you wouldn't go,

3299
02:41:05,730 --> 02:41:08,280
I need you to dance.
I need to want it more.

3300
02:41:08,850 --> 02:41:13,170
All that does is make you want it when 
you didn't want it to begin with.

3301
02:41:13,350 --> 02:41:18,350
Oh,
I didn't think about fucking till she 

3302
02:41:18,350 --> 02:41:18,600
did all that thing on the brass poll.
Now I have a boner,

3303
02:41:18,840 --> 02:41:23,840
now I'm using that as my leader.
Do you know what I'm saying?

3304
02:41:24,300 --> 02:41:28,590
Not particularly thinking about fucking 
Brian.

3305
02:41:28,710 --> 02:41:31,440
And then there's a girl dancing around a
brass pole.

3306
02:41:31,490 --> 02:41:34,590
Cidex shaking her ass.
So now I have a boner.

3307
02:41:34,591 --> 02:41:37,530
Now I'm thinking about fucking where I 
would've just talked to you.

3308
02:41:37,560 --> 02:41:39,150
Well,
for girls just sitting outside,

3309
02:41:39,151 --> 02:41:44,151
reading a book,
not thinking about fucking and Jason 

3310
02:41:44,151 --> 02:41:44,151
Momoa shows up and he's in an open 
shirt,

3311
02:41:44,151 --> 02:41:46,320
like some sort of cis guy that you 
fantasize about.

3312
02:41:46,530 --> 02:41:49,420
Game of thrones,
put them on and his.

3313
02:41:49,530 --> 02:41:51,600
He's chopping wood.
Travis with his name.

3314
02:41:51,750 --> 02:41:52,770
Travis.
Jamie.

3315
02:41:52,980 --> 02:41:56,700
Jamie's tropic chopping wood with a 
giant ax and the girls get all juicy.

3316
02:41:56,850 --> 02:41:58,710
Just looking at him because he's 
perfect.

3317
02:41:59,490 --> 02:42:02,130
That's him.
Shut the fuck.

3318
02:42:02,310 --> 02:42:04,380
Come on.
I was going to say with a nipple ring,

3319
02:42:04,381 --> 02:42:07,350
but that was the cursor.
Come on.

3320
02:42:07,351 --> 02:42:08,920
It's a handsome man and he's a very 
friendly too.

3321
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:10,770
I met him at whole foods.
You're not,

3322
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:12,360
as you say,
he's not because you're not a woman,

3323
02:42:12,610 --> 02:42:14,010
by the way.
It's about six visits.

3324
02:42:14,070 --> 02:42:16,740
Baseball player.
What's his name from the nationals?

3325
02:42:16,741 --> 02:42:19,590
The most beautiful men in sports.
I was called Jason.

3326
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:20,680
Uh,
Joe,

3327
02:42:21,150 --> 02:42:24,030
just the guy with the big beard from the
nationals.

3328
02:42:24,270 --> 02:42:27,630
He's fucking biking,
but that guy's a muscle bound.

3329
02:42:27,900 --> 02:42:30,270
You're in a weird dudes.
I'm going to have to.

3330
02:42:30,990 --> 02:42:35,990
Is the girls like worth worth with an e,
W,

3331
02:42:36,421 --> 02:42:37,500
e r t h?

3332
02:42:37,530 --> 02:42:40,830
That guy is fucking gorgeous.
It's not a competition is.

3333
02:42:40,831 --> 02:42:41,210
It?
Is.

3334
02:42:41,220 --> 02:42:43,310
It is what I want to have an issue with 
Jason Momoa.

3335
02:42:43,590 --> 02:42:46,020
We're gonna end this podcast with a 
twitter.

3336
02:42:46,550 --> 02:42:51,550
A bit like invite ladies because we both
have 80 percent male fan basis.

3337
02:42:52,080 --> 02:42:55,260
More than that.
I went and I went on instagram.

3338
02:42:55,261 --> 02:42:56,460
It looks Jason Worth.
Okay.

3339
02:42:56,461 --> 02:42:58,030
I'm with you.
That's the one.

3340
02:42:58,031 --> 02:43:00,810
The one you just touch and that's the 
one was traps.

3341
02:43:00,930 --> 02:43:05,930
Fucking that guy.
I've been able to get naked photos of 

3342
02:43:05,930 --> 02:43:09,420
base ball bat a giant one,
not even one of those ways.

3343
02:43:09,421 --> 02:43:11,140
We give out for free for ladies 
listening.

3344
02:43:11,590 --> 02:43:14,600
Jason Werth or Jason Momoa.
Oh,

3345
02:43:14,690 --> 02:43:17,050
I'll battle of the Jason.
Jason's.

3346
02:43:17,530 --> 02:43:18,790
Listen,
it's just a matter of like,

3347
02:43:18,791 --> 02:43:20,050
what do you want to do?
Do?

3348
02:43:20,140 --> 02:43:25,140
Do you want to live in a margin or do 
you want to live on the beach and raise 

3349
02:43:25,140 --> 02:43:25,140
your kids in the sand?
Okay.

3350
02:43:25,140 --> 02:43:29,871
You gotTa pick your poison.
I have no idea how he came over on the 

3351
02:43:29,871 --> 02:43:31,750
fucking raft.
Like he's some kind of Polynesian.

3352
02:43:31,780 --> 02:43:33,430
God.
He's from Hawaii.

3353
02:43:34,110 --> 02:43:38,380
It's like six foot of the most expensive
state to live in.

3354
02:43:39,020 --> 02:43:43,100
Only for one refuge for white people.
You're not even paying attention to.

3355
02:43:43,101 --> 02:43:44,630
You want me to.
Islands are on Hawaii pro,

3356
02:43:45,440 --> 02:43:47,290
so racist five.

3357
02:43:50,070 --> 02:43:51,730
Sorry.
Is this a bonus question?

3358
02:43:54,880 --> 02:43:59,880
Do you smell like smoke enough that 
you're going to get in trouble when you 

3359
02:43:59,880 --> 02:44:00,190
get home?
How old are your kids now?

3360
02:44:00,280 --> 02:44:02,320
Seven and nine for the young ones I 
forgot.

3361
02:44:02,330 --> 02:44:02,830
Uh,
uh,

3362
02:44:03,130 --> 02:44:05,620
uh,
daddy smells like cigarette smoke.

3363
02:44:05,890 --> 02:44:07,690
I've got shirts here that I could 
change,

3364
02:44:07,930 --> 02:44:12,930
but it's good that you did this,
you chain smoke through this because we 

3365
02:44:12,930 --> 02:44:12,930
realized this system sucks.
Yeah,

3366
02:44:12,930 --> 02:44:15,610
I noticed that.
Or whatever is making the system.

3367
02:44:15,611 --> 02:44:20,611
I've been breathing it.
I definitely got a secondhand nicotine 

3368
02:44:20,611 --> 02:44:20,780
high.
It should be cold to in the air.

3369
02:44:21,010 --> 02:44:24,000
Just good.
We'll get a call.

3370
02:44:24,010 --> 02:44:25,730
Jason Dill.
Tell me before you showed them,

3371
02:44:25,970 --> 02:44:28,030
hey,
you got to think like a bar,

3372
02:44:28,290 --> 02:44:33,290
a bar.
Don't think like your grandma smoked in 

3373
02:44:33,290 --> 02:44:33,290
occasionally in the bathroom.
He said,

3374
02:44:33,410 --> 02:44:38,410
I said,
did Rogan put this system in 

3375
02:44:38,410 --> 02:44:38,410
specifically for me?
And he goes,

3376
02:44:38,410 --> 02:44:38,410
I think so.

3377
02:44:39,130 --> 02:44:42,440
Definitely for you and dice clay you 
tell to tell.

3378
02:44:42,520 --> 02:44:43,210
Yeah,
he's another one.

3379
02:44:43,211 --> 02:44:48,211
I can't live without.
The cigarettes were outside and just 

3380
02:44:48,211 --> 02:44:50,431
keeps going.
He's just had five days off of them 

3381
02:44:50,431 --> 02:44:52,831
coming into this.
Did you really for five day quit 

3382
02:44:52,831 --> 02:44:52,900
everything for five days except 
medicinal drinking.

3383
02:44:53,020 --> 02:44:57,130
Do a couple shots of whiskey because at 
this point can't quit cold Turkey.

3384
02:44:57,131 --> 02:44:59,680
Very dangerous.
Broadly understand.

3385
02:45:00,190 --> 02:45:01,630
So now when you,
uh,

3386
02:45:01,900 --> 02:45:03,810
what was harder,
um,

3387
02:45:04,820 --> 02:45:07,150
what does it feel like to take five days
off of cigarettes?

3388
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:10,390
When I do it my way,
perfect.

3389
02:45:10,391 --> 02:45:12,110
Fantastic.
Because I.

3390
02:45:12,490 --> 02:45:17,470
No one can come around me if I don't 
have to do a phoner or write a thing.

3391
02:45:17,471 --> 02:45:19,780
Write a book.
When you write to you like to.

3392
02:45:19,781 --> 02:45:24,781
Well that's the hardest thing of 
everything I just go to doing stand up 

3393
02:45:27,250 --> 02:45:32,250
writing is.
That's where it's integral to the 

3394
02:45:32,250 --> 02:45:32,350
process chain.
Smoking,

3395
02:45:33,300 --> 02:45:33,880
tap,
tap,

3396
02:45:33,881 --> 02:45:34,960
tap,
tap,

3397
02:45:34,961 --> 02:45:35,470
tap,
tap,

3398
02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:36,880
smoke,
whiskey,

3399
02:45:36,881 --> 02:45:37,510
drank.
Tap,

3400
02:45:37,511 --> 02:45:37,960
tap,
tap.

3401
02:45:38,710 --> 02:45:43,710
Yeah.
Everything else I get over writing was 

3402
02:45:43,710 --> 02:45:46,501
the only.
You don't want to find like sometimes 

3403
02:45:46,501 --> 02:45:47,050
some of my best bits have been me drunk 
on an airplane.

3404
02:45:49,370 --> 02:45:54,370
I have the exact opposite where I talk 
about I get off an airplane drunk and I 

3405
02:45:55,121 --> 02:46:00,121
have stacks of cocktail napkins.
I say if it says Delta on the Napkin,

3406
02:46:01,030 --> 02:46:05,680
this job sucks and they're not even 
jokes there pontificating.

3407
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:10,190
What about this and that?
Twice in 20 years

3408
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:12,560
I've gotten good bits off of drunk 
airplane

3409
02:46:13,170 --> 02:46:14,910
twice in 20 years.
A good number though.

3410
02:46:15,150 --> 02:46:18,360
If you could find one thing where you 
could do like 300 times,

3411
02:46:18,370 --> 02:46:23,220
you get 20 great bits or twice to grow.
Even to like,

3412
02:46:23,540 --> 02:46:27,210
like think about how many days you spent
trying to write to get two great bits.

3413
02:46:27,930 --> 02:46:30,940
It's the amount of bad bits though where
yeah,

3414
02:46:31,060 --> 02:46:34,170
I'm embarrassed to have the Napkin in my
pocket.

3415
02:46:34,171 --> 02:46:39,171
Like,
what the fuck does this even have those 

3416
02:46:39,171 --> 02:46:39,480
saved on.
Smith has a great show.

3417
02:46:39,540 --> 02:46:43,230
He's doing where he has you pulled out 
your old notebook.

3418
02:46:43,480 --> 02:46:46,570
Fucking cock sucker.
Told me

3419
02:46:49,470 --> 02:46:51,090
Brian Hannigan.
You Lazy Bitch.

3420
02:46:52,260 --> 02:46:54,200
No.
Doing it for awhile.

3421
02:46:54,330 --> 02:46:59,330
First Notebook where you have to go and 
read the shit you wrote in 1990 that you

3422
02:46:59,461 --> 02:47:00,960
thought was brilliant.
Yes.

3423
02:47:01,060 --> 02:47:01,680
Well,
here's the thing.

3424
02:47:02,040 --> 02:47:07,040
We're trying to send a tweet about it.
Why does it have to be I shall 20 

3425
02:47:08,110 --> 02:47:10,430
individual and how come you kind of do 
it just.

3426
02:47:10,440 --> 02:47:10,830
Well,

3427
02:47:10,940 --> 02:47:13,550
see how he just shut the fuck up because
he knows he's wrong.

3428
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:15,470
Oh No,
actually joe just made my point.

3429
02:47:17,180 --> 02:47:22,180
You weren't listening to anything.
Is anything wrong with you going over 

3430
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:25,571
your your notebook,
but going into other people's notebooks 

3431
02:47:25,571 --> 02:47:27,170
then you're sort of like,
if you decide like,

3432
02:47:27,171 --> 02:47:28,210
hey,
I'm doug stanhope,

3433
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:33,220
I want to break out my notebook and tell
you how fucking terrible my $19 goes 

3434
02:47:33,220 --> 02:47:33,440
into other people's notebooks.
No,

3435
02:47:33,441 --> 02:47:34,850
Owen Smith,
not Owen.

3436
02:47:34,851 --> 02:47:36,680
Benjamin,
Benjamin's upstate New York.

3437
02:47:36,770 --> 02:47:38,210
Owen Smith,
la.

3438
02:47:38,270 --> 02:47:40,980
Hilarious comedian.
He goes into yours.

3439
02:47:41,240 --> 02:47:44,600
I had to bring out my shit.
I brought out some shit from 1990.

3440
02:47:44,940 --> 02:47:48,470
I had some like 1991 notebooks.
There were terrible.

3441
02:47:48,471 --> 02:47:51,720
I had like orchestrated crowd work and 
then you ask the crowd boos.

3442
02:47:51,800 --> 02:47:55,570
Knew a girl.
Oh,

3443
02:47:55,580 --> 02:47:57,280
it was brutal.
It was sold.

3444
02:47:57,830 --> 02:47:59,300
Oh,
I want to be on that show.

3445
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:05,080
Created it,
but by creator didn't create feed into 

3446
02:48:05,080 --> 02:48:06,270
flowers.
Oh,

3447
02:48:06,280 --> 02:48:08,990
and Smith.
Good on you for doing it first.

3448
02:48:09,170 --> 02:48:14,170
How long ago did you guys come up with 
the idea when everyone else was coming 

3449
02:48:14,170 --> 02:48:15,320
up with other.
I did it about a year ago.

3450
02:48:15,710 --> 02:48:17,750
A list in the last three years.

3451
02:48:17,840 --> 02:48:22,840
Yeah.
I did his thing within a year and he 

3452
02:48:22,840 --> 02:48:22,840
already had it

3453
02:48:22,840 --> 02:48:24,450
filming it.
I am not.

3454
02:48:25,530 --> 02:48:30,530
Hey,
comedy and policies that are civilians 

3455
02:48:30,530 --> 02:48:30,530
listening.
Don't do.

3456
02:48:30,530 --> 02:48:34,140
I'm not saying he stole my idea.
I don't know.

3457
02:48:34,170 --> 02:48:39,170
It's the WHO.
It's the nurse that think they are the 

3458
02:48:39,170 --> 02:48:39,540
comedy police.
Don't talk to Tommy's.

3459
02:48:40,050 --> 02:48:42,960
Just let them be dummies.
Hate it.

3460
02:48:43,620 --> 02:48:48,240
Hey,
I saw so and so did your bit.

3461
02:48:48,330 --> 02:48:51,330
He was talking about porn and you talk 
about porn.

3462
02:48:52,140 --> 02:48:56,370
You fucking shut up.
Let us police ourselves registered to be

3463
02:48:56,371 --> 02:48:58,320
in Manhattan to patch the tires.
Oh,

3464
02:48:58,610 --> 02:49:01,650
today I'm going.
So Irish,

3465
02:49:01,651 --> 02:49:03,930
which is better because he hates the 
Irish.

3466
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:09,160
I was about to.
I was about to closing this podcast 

3467
02:49:09,160 --> 02:49:10,740
because I'm saving a piss either.
I'm going to Piss.

3468
02:49:10,741 --> 02:49:13,550
Let it go and let it slide that book 
over here.

3469
02:49:13,560 --> 02:49:17,520
And also Brian has notes.
First of all,

3470
02:49:17,521 --> 02:49:19,980
what's important is a hey,
diversity.

3471
02:49:20,160 --> 02:49:22,020
We'd like to have more diversity in this
room,

3472
02:49:22,021 --> 02:49:23,640
but diversity,
diversity,

3473
02:49:23,850 --> 02:49:27,810
diversity is what were the tour?
We say more women podcast or.

3474
02:49:27,811 --> 02:49:28,710
Go ahead.
So the tour,

3475
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:30,750

3476
02:49:30,780 --> 02:49:35,130
April 2018 down under.
But the world is flat.

3477
02:49:38,490 --> 02:49:43,490
It's not me heckling myself.
Doug Stanhope Australia in April.

3478
02:49:44,671 --> 02:49:46,470
He's going to be an Adelaide,

Perth,
Sydney Park.

3481
02:49:50,730 --> 02:49:53,360
So we don't be.
Oh,

3482
02:49:53,370 --> 02:49:56,400
don't you don't me will come to the end 
of the rainbow.

3483
02:50:00,650 --> 02:50:03,840
So Irish in him and it makes them even 
snappier.

3484
02:50:03,870 --> 02:50:08,310
Oh,
before that we're also doing a Hong Kong

3485
02:50:08,311 --> 02:50:10,480
Singapore system.

3486
02:50:10,650 --> 02:50:14,270
Be Racist.
I can't have this on my podcast.

3487
02:50:14,650 --> 02:50:15,590
Who?
Ci Men.

3488
02:50:15,710 --> 02:50:18,260
God,
he's still a guy.

3489
02:50:18,880 --> 02:50:20,650
He's still over there.
Yeah,

3490
02:50:20,940 --> 02:50:23,960
I think he does karaoke or something.
I don't know.

3491
02:50:24,920 --> 02:50:27,580
So Doug Stan hope.com.
Just go there.

3492

Buy The book.
Here's the book,

3493
02:50:28,971 --> 02:50:30,480
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I really need.

3494
02:50:30,481 --> 02:50:34,250
The money is not fame.
One of my all time favorite humans.

3495
02:50:34,520 --> 02:50:35,330
Doug,
the Stan Hope.

3496

Ladies and gentlemen,

You know we love you.
Thank you.

3498
02:50:38,270 --> 02:50:39,620
Fuck with you.
Because you tolerate it.

3499
02:50:39,950 --> 02:50:41,150
You gotta fight back.
Oh yeah.

3500
02:50:41,210 --> 02:50:43,010
Okay.
You can't keep taking this from us.

3501
02:50:43,011 --> 02:50:44,900
It's just not right.
It makes me feel bad.

3502
02:50:45,260 --> 02:50:48,200
We'd go after you and we team up on Ya.
I just feel and I'm like,

3503
02:50:48,230 --> 02:50:53,230
please fire back.
Ms Dot Hannigan somewhere a storm is 

3504
02:50:53,230 --> 02:50:56,440
brewing.
Your new nickname is hennessy though 

3505
02:50:56,440 --> 02:50:59,080
this happened.
It except it didn't get you a sensor 

3506
02:50:59,080 --> 02:51:01,650
everywhere you go,
the better than Shenanigan or Heineken,

3507
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:05,660
which everyone thinks is hilarious.
Shenanigans.

3508
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:08,480
I liked that even better.
That's like the verbal equivalent of the

3509
02:51:08,481 --> 02:51:13,280
Hawaiian shirt and you just gave us two.
We have to choose from Brian Shenanigans

3510
02:51:13,281 --> 02:51:15,330
or Brian.
Hi.

3511
02:51:16,070 --> 02:51:21,070
He hates worse.
So now we have to choose from like 

3512
02:51:21,070 --> 02:51:23,501
Tennessee because it makes them 
uncomfortable because it's associated 

3513
02:51:23,501 --> 02:51:23,750
with African Americans.
So I like that better.

3514
02:51:23,751 --> 02:51:26,960
That I didn't know that I am phenomena 
land.

3515
02:51:27,330 --> 02:51:28,400
We don't have.

3516
02:51:30,630 --> 02:51:32,640
I didn't know nothing about your coop 
Aussie.

3517
02:51:32,860 --> 02:51:37,860
A mad dog.
20 slash 20 vision drank is past tense.

3518
02:51:41,351 --> 02:51:42,550
What?
This purple drank.

3519
02:51:42,910 --> 02:51:44,640
I happened to Lake Mickey's

3520
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:49,640
as you know.
Do you drink orange soda and eat fried 

3521
02:51:49,640 --> 02:51:49,680
chicken around black people or no?
I beg your pardon?

3522
02:51:49,830 --> 02:51:51,960
He doesn't.
He's never around black people.

3523
02:51:51,961 --> 02:51:53,880
We cloister him.
Is that a word?

3524
02:51:54,780 --> 02:51:59,780
Dogs Calm Talk Mrs.
Rhonda to you via text.

3525
02:52:02,600 --> 02:52:04,850
I was going to wear my brown

3526
02:52:06,630 --> 02:52:08,890
and I,
I came to my pajamas on.

3527
02:52:08,930 --> 02:52:10,300
Sorry.
I came in very comfortable.

3528
02:52:10,720 --> 02:52:12,090
I like comfort.
Uh,

3529
02:52:12,091 --> 02:52:15,070
this is not fame by Douglas.
Stan.

3530
02:52:15,071 --> 02:52:19,870
Hope forward by Drew Pinski,
MD,

3531
02:52:19,871 --> 02:52:21,550

3532
02:52:21,710 --> 02:52:24,020

02:52:24,430 --> 02:52:26,830
A great forward.

3534
02:52:26,831 --> 02:52:27,370
Busy?

3535
02:52:27,980 --> 02:52:28,140
No,

3536
02:52:30,850 --> 02:52:34,270
Mr Hennessy.
Always good to see you,

3537
02:52:34,280 --> 02:52:37,090
my brother very much.
Thank you for being here.

3538
02:52:37,810 --> 02:52:38,680
You know we love you,
right?

3539
02:52:38,681 --> 02:52:39,370
No.
Okay.

3540
02:52:39,371 --> 02:52:41,740
This is a very impressive facility.
Thanks sir.

3541
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:47,000
All right folks.
We'll be back tomorrow with the great 

3542
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,300

one of my favorite musicians tomorrow.

3543
02:52:51,130 --> 02:52:53,850
Oh Wow.
