1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,680
Dog,
should I put this in my mct oil is a 

2
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:11,490
good idea or bad idea.
How long are we going to dogs?

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,030
Depends on how long you can hold back 
the flood gates of hell.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,540
Why is that?
Is a coconut emulsified.

5
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,230
Mct Oil.
I will never talk to you.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,240
Swear to God.
My Com does not look like that and it 

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,240
definitely doesn't keep that well in 
plastic.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,930
Dean White,
you're so healthy.

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,560
I'm eating a lot of organic food.
Too much change too.

10
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:37,140
When my comlex wow.
Looks like elmers glue.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,340
No,
that's not too much at all.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,890
This is nothing wrong with us.
We were,

13
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:42,870
we were talking before for people that 
just tuned in.

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,810
There was no other way to tune in now.
But unless a bug,

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,800
the studio recording us.
Um,

16
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:54,801
we were talking about the,
the drama behind taking too much mct 

17
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:58,311
oil.
There's a feeling that you get like a 

18
00:00:58,311 --> 00:00:58,910
water bubble pops in your stomach.

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,310
Like,
oh,

20
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,010
Jesus.
Yeah.

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,020
It's just abortion.
Abortion.

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,710
There's some ribs crack.
Something goes wrong and then you must 

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,950
get to the toilet immediately.
And I don't know why I was,

24
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:15,951
I was trying to figure it out,
like whether or not it's like the oil 

25
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,951
itself where it lubricates,
but that doesn't make any sense because 

26
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:19,830
a lot of water comes out of your body to
somehow or another.

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,070
I don't get it.
Do you ever do colonics?

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,230
No.
Not good for you ever.

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,880
Are they?
I don't know.

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,330
I don't know either.
Placebo effect is a measurable effect.

31
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,310
Right?
So if you think it's good for you,

32
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:34,510
maybe it is or I don't know.
But um,

33
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,310
I have done a couple and uh,
I don't do them anymore.

34
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,440
I just was like,
when I first got money I was like,

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,910
I shouldn't pay guys to like put things 
in my bat.

36
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,380
So a guy did it,
a guy did it weird.

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,040
I'm just like,
well,

38
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,910
because I was thinking about,
I was like,

39
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:58,911
guys,
I know putting things in my butt was 

40
00:01:58,911 --> 00:01:58,911
weird.
That's weird.

41
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:02,770
It's a weird paying.
Someone I at least feel like I have a 

42
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:02,880
modicum of control and can actually sort
of set boundaries.

43
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:05,610
But it's weird.
There's so many weird things going on.

44
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:07,400
It's hard to isolate what's 
uncomfortable about.

45
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,820
I feel like putting things in the bud is
a lot like Catholic school girls in that

46
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,450
suppression is what,
what creates the diamond,

47
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,890
you know,
you know what I mean?

48
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:17,710
It's true.
Like,

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,570
it's weird because he did find a diamond
in there.

50
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,010
He flushed me out.
What I mean by that is,

51
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,290
um,
when we were kids,

52
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,590
we all knew the Catholic school girls 
were like the biggest hose because they 

53
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,030
had the repression.
Pendulum has to swing.

54
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,800
Exactly.
Yeah.

55
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,950
You can't hang to the right to find 
equilibrium horse.

56
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,750
Yeah.
Catholics.

57
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:46,560
I know I did.
Jesus did for a bunch of years,

58
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:51,561
but a five slash six.
But I was,

59
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:54,490
I mean my fate was sealed away before 
Catholic school.

60
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,870
It was just like my excuse for my 
behavior,

61
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:00,180
but I went to Catholic school,
not why I was a mazda

62
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,650
way before then,
but it weirdly.

63
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:07,651
Yeah,
I mean there's so much transgression 

64
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:10,080
within the Catholics.
Everyone was getting in trouble because 

65
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,900
they were all sort of rebelling against 
forbidden.

66
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,670
It is forbidden.
I think it's like the buck,

67
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,290
but sex,
it's the same thing.

68
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,800
Well,
it's funny you put it in there.

69
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,870
It's funny you said that because I was 
thinking about you during,

70
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:22,750
but Zach,
no,

71
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,530
uh,
I was thinking about like,

72
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,550
because because I was like,
I'm coming on the show tomorrow and I 

73
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:29,550
felt like La the last couple times I did
the show is like,

74
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,490
I feel like I was in a weirdly,
like I was talking about like,

75
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,600
like I just come back from Vietnam with 
deformed babies and,

76
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,520
and I was like,
is it going to go that way or were you 

77
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,560
talking about deformed babies again 
because I'm out of deformed babies 

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,830
stories and I was at the gym last night 
and I know it's obvious.

79
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,390
I go to the gym,
a La Fitness,

80
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:56,980
I go to La fitness because I am 
successful and I can afford $28 a month,

81
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,910
no problem.
And I was in the bathroom just like,

82
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,840
you know,
whatever.

83
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,020
And I heard this girl on the phone and 
she was like,

84
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:06,640
you know,
when you see someone pacing on the phone

85
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:07,060
and you're like,
oh,

86
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:08,240
that's like a business call.
And I,

87
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:11,400
I just incapable of minding my own 
business.

88
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,490
I was listening to her,
she was also yelling and she goes,

89
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:15,730
uh,
she was,

90
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,590
you know,
of the phone.

91
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,610
She was like,
you know,

92
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,760
I don't really get,
I've only been asked to do one anal 

93
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,650
scene.
This is,

94
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,390
it sounds like I'm lying.
I know it sounds like the stories ally,

95
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,190
I've only been asked to do one anal 
scene.

96
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,250
It went on and she's like,
and it doesn't make any sense because I 

97
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,330
don't do anal on my personal life,
so it's really tight.

98
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,280
This happened in the La fitness locker 
room and I was just like,

99
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,670
I was a gog for many reasons and uh,
I would think that that will be like 

100
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,650
standard in La that you'd run into porn 
stars you think?

101
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,620
And I'm sure we do all the time.
I don't hear them talking to their,

102
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,780
I don't hear them negotiating deals.
Like this went on for quite a long time.

103
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,000
She did talk about when her rent was 
due.

104
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:06,010
I mean I was in there for quite a while 
and it just made me think about how 

105
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,660
grateful I am that I don't do porn,
do porn.

106
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,500
That's a good thing to be grateful for.
I had a friend of mine who,

107
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,550
uh,
his buddy was dating a porn star and it 

108
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,410
was like no big deal.
It's no big deal.

109
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,430
We all have sex.
No big deal.

110
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,450
Yeah.
And then one day the straw that broke 

111
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,420
the camel's back was she was going over 
her contract and he was,

112
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:27,160
apparently they're,
they actually asked.

113
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,310
They have contracts sometimes.
Yeah.

114
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,660
I don't know if they always do,
but in the contract it said air tight 

115
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,500
and he was like,
what's airtight?

116
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,030
And she was like,
it's a guy in every hole.

117
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,160
And he's like,
I'm good.

118
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,540
That's it.
We're done.

119
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,000
It's over APP.
That was that.

120
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,780
Was it just a one in the ass,
one of the plugs you want on the mound?

121
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,380
I mean,
it was,

122
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:54,290
and I couldn't stop thinking about it,
uh,

123
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,550
because I was of course,
like I had just,

124
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:58,070
we had been about,
I came back from

125
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,210
Tulsa and I had a connection and I was 
like,

126
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,810
I've like what Bill Hicks used to call 
it,

127
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:07,160
a flying saucer tour in the places only.
We're flying saucers go.

128
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,380
Amazing Hicks used to call it,
he would do the south.

129
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,230
We do the flying saucer tourists because
that's same as you.

130
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,290
That's how he would work out and stuff.
He would go to these like weird road 

131
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,950
gigs.
I call it the kidnapped comedy tour,

132
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,130
which is what I'm leaving the airport 
with the driver.

133
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,660
I'm like,
I'm being kidnapped,

134
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,820
like,
because I truly don't know if there's no

135
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:33,821
house.
I mean we were just like in the middle 

136
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:35,801
of nowhere and I was like,
I'm either going to go to a casino and 

137
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:35,801
do stand up or get murdered brutally.
And a field.

138
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:37,260
Is that what you're doing?
Because he knows I did a casino.

139
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:37,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

140
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,290
My Mommy's got bills,
mommy's got a lot of bills to pay.

141
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,910
And uh,
oh,

142
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,680
in this girl she just went on and on and
on.

143
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,300
And um,
she said something.

144
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:49,490
It was so interesting to me.
She was like a,

145
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,580
and it doesn't make any sense because I 
don't do anal in my personal life.

146
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,390
Yeah,
that's crazy.

147
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,420
And I thought it was so interesting that
a porn star had boundaries in her 

148
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,680
personal life and.
But she'll do it on camera,

149
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,900
we'll do it for money.
And I sort of.

150
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:05,900
It made me think about my boundaries.
I was like,

151
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:07,790
this girl has stronger boundaries than I
do.

152
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:08,630
It's very.
Well,

153
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,340
I mean it's a preference issue,
right?

154
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:13,610
Like some girls are actually like it.
Like it's a bizarre thing I've had.

155
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:17,960
I've had it come up on stage before 
where people will like raise their hands

156
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:19,500
and say I love it.
Yeah,

157
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,840
I get it.
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna chime in too

158
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,340
much on this,
but I,

159
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,840
I agree with you.

160
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,790
I think some people just like to be 
dirty too.

161
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,060
They like to be a dirty girl.
I just don't know when sex got so 

162
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,880
boring,
just regular old set.

163
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:38,990
It's like it's got to be so weird.
Now gets a lot of it is who you're doing

164
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,240
it with,
why you're doing it to them.

165
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,950
Is it maintenance sex?
Oh,

166
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,540
you're really turned on,
right?

167
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,570
Do you really like them?
Do you want them to like you both are 

168
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,470
mutually enamored with each other or a 
mental connection to get them to be 

169
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,480
enamored with you animals?
Yeah.

170
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:56,900
Is it to animals?
Is it pure?

171
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,870
Is it a power thing like that billy Joel
Song?

172
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,000
What's that?
We didn't have trust.

173
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,530
Oh yeah,
that's a good one.

174
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,520
Old School.
We just so desensitized from porn.

175
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,930
I'm fascinated by that.
Well,

176
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:13,931
there's definitely that 100 percent.
I'm doing this bit in my act now about 

177
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:17,231
the loss of pubic hair that there was at
one point in time people just had pubic 

178
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:21,170
hair and now it just seems like women 
don't have pubic hair anymore.

179
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,590
Look,
I got it lasered off five years ago and 

180
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,031
I have been freezing ever since I am.
So drinking hot tea just tried to stay.

181
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,530
Have you ever thought a wool pants and 
shiver?

182
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,600
No.
I'm going to have to get a Merkin or 

183
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,201
like plugs,
so hits your eyebrows.

184
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,480
Have to go to pippins guy.

185
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,470
So I.
it's interesting you say that.

186
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,020
A friend of mine,
she is more like a family,

187
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:56,021
like acquaintance and she's got a 
daughter who's 15 who had her first 

188
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:56,060
sexual experience at it was,

189
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,560
I don't think they had sex,
but a man's man,

190
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,230
a boy her age saw her naked,
so there's no legal issues.

191
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,740
There was no like don't call her most 
authorities.

192
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:09,741
Normal stuff.
She came home hysterically crying after 

193
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:13,191
her first.
A teenage boy saw her naked because he 

194
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:16,950
saw her private area and was like,
what is that?

195
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,880
He had never seen pubic hair before 
because he had only seen porn.

196
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Oh my God.
And he had never seen a Lavia before 

197
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,210
because in a lot of porn they have 
labioplasty,

198
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,510
so he sees this like horrific chicken 
gizzards.

199
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,550
He thinks that she's deformed or has a 
giant skin tag because in porn they 

200
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:42,861
don't have a lot of it that,
that comment that they get their Libya 

201
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:44,370
chopped cotton.
When you see a vagina and porn that does

202
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:49,371
not have the orchid,
like an elephant ear,

203
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:56,010
whatever catcher's Mitt for,
you're watching porn.

204
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,840
Obviously.
That's apparently the most popular.

205
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:01,990
Yes,
I know.

206
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,420
Why.
What's the theory getting reason?

207
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:09,421
Why Ron?
Jeremy was a big time porn star because 

208
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:10,270
like people looked at Ron,
Jeremy fucking these girls and they were

209
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,770
like,
Hey,

210
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,640
I've run aspirational.
It's not like Ryan Reynolds.

211
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,590
It's like I kind of looked like Ron 
Jeremy and he's getting laid.

212
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,670
He wears a shirt and his born and if you
see these,

213
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,200
these women that are like 45 and still 
do what I could get her.

214
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,420
She's in my living room.
She's an apartment forced.

215
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,040
I'm married to what a crazy bitch.
She's right over there.

216
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,810
Interesting.
So maybe just like movies,

217
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:36,150
there's like aspirational and then 
there's,

218
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,710
you know,
relatable.

219
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,590
Relatable I think is a big factor with a
MILF.

220
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:42,580
Porn.
I guess for me I can,

221
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:45,750
and maybe this is my being a girl,
maybe it's being a comic,

222
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:47,340
maybe it's having a hyperactive 
Amygdala.

223
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,370
I don't know,
but when I watch porn it's really hard 

224
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,891
for me to separate what I'm looking at 
from how the person got there and when 

225
00:10:55,921 --> 00:11:00,921
they're young I'm like,
she's an idiot and she had a bad 

226
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:01,980
childhood and it happens.
But when they're older in lessons,

227
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:03,750
Jenna Jamison or someone who's been 
doing it for a long time,

228
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,790
I'm like,
who at 43 starts doing its just too 

229
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,010
tragic for me.
The jump off,

230
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:16,011
like how do you jump off the train and 
when do you decide you've had enough 

231
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:16,740
years on the ride?
That's the,

232
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,220
that would be the issue is there,
is it because they're sending so many of

233
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,040
them are on drugs and,
and had bad childhoods.

234
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,540
And I mean I can't,
I.

235
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,000
The only point I really am able to watch
is the so like Tom,

236
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,600
you know,
Tumbler Tumbler,

237
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:34,350
tumbler has great porn because it's just
an increments of like eight seconds.

238
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,400
Tumblr is porn.
No,

239
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:41,450
well it's,
it's like teenagers blogs about 

240
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,151
twilight,
pinterest type collections of furniture 

241
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:44,270
and stuff.
But there's,

242
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,300
you know,
there's also a gif files.

243
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:51,350
Exactly.
But there's also like some porn ones 

244
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,750
that are sort of tasteful and it's only 
an increment of eight seconds and it 

245
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,441
just replays it.
So you don't have time to see the bad 

246
00:11:58,441 --> 00:11:58,630
furniture in the background or the,
you know,

247
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,370
like I can't,
I get distracted by the,

248
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,620
the decor,
the bed.

249
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,120
I'm like,
that's,

250
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,600
that's,
that's Ikea.

251
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:08,680
It's not assembled properly.
Like I get distracted so easily.

252
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,380
Like if a girl's got a tattoo on her 
thigh,

253
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:13,510
all I can think about is where it's 
gonna look like in 20 years.

254
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,320
Like I can't separate enjoying porn from
the porn stars,

255
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:20,380
bad decisions and I get worried about 
them.

256
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:22,540
So this is good because it's eight 
seconds and I can't.

257
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,560
My mind can't wander.
I get it.

258
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,710
And they have some that are black and 
white,

259
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,020
which is kind of sexy.
It's already.

260
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:33,370
And it always looks consensual.
I can't really get turned on.

261
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:35,350
But because I can tell when a girl is 
faking,

262
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,810
I can tell I've done it,
I've seen it.

263
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:38,590
I know,
you know.

264
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,960
So when a girl is just like overdoing it
or something,

265
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,540
I'm just sort of like a bummer.
So it is

266
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:49,010
a strange thing.
The overwhelming number of people that 

267
00:12:49,141 --> 00:12:52,890
watch other people have sex and 
masturbate in history,

268
00:12:52,891 --> 00:12:57,891
in the history of human beings.
There has never been more people 

269
00:12:57,891 --> 00:13:00,510
masturbating to other people having sex.
It's triggered.

270
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,620
It's fascinating.
And also I've gotten kind of obsessed 

271
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,100
with this because I recently did a movie
where,

272
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,200
you know,
when you do stuff you do like focus 

273
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,200
group testing.
And there was a scene in the movie where

274
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,360
Blake Griffin,
the basketball player,

275
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,060
really funny actor,
he's great in it,

276
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,340
is with successfully strong.
They're married.

277
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,090
And the scene was that a,
I wrote it with Neal Brennan actually,

278
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,070
that he walks in on his wife 
masturbating in what that is,

279
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,740
you know,
like women walking on men,

280
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:31,070
Matt,
Matt guys rate all the time.

281
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:33,290
But how he takes it personally and you 
know,

282
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,560
it's sort of a threat to his masculinity
and manhood and he's insulted and his 

283
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,940
feelings are hurt and all this stuff.
And uh,

284
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,400
so she's at a table and there's a 
computer and that's the deal.

285
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,060
I guess I just put my own experience 
into it.

286
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,420
Not,
no,

287
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:50,420
I just assume everyone masturbates the 
same way to the same things,

288
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:52,910
the same vibe when we played it for the 
focus groups,

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
everyone was so confused about what was 
going on when he comes in and sees her 

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,861
at the desk with her hands under the 
table with the computer and then she 

291
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:03,620
throws the computer down and she's 
freaked out.

292
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:07,010
And to me it's very obvious that she was
masturbating in the scene,

293
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,900
uh,
in the focus groups.

294
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,190
This one guy was like,
oh,

295
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:11,990
I had no idea she was masturbating.
I mean,

296
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,700
wherever the candles.
I was like,

297
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,760
what you like kit?
Like everybody masturbates so 

298
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,391
differently.
I learned that dude masturbates with 

299
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:25,630
candles.
You might have a ceremonial,

300
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:32,110
because I thought all guys masturbate 
under a bridge where they belong and 

301
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,301
then the wind were even weirder.
One woman was like,

302
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,820
oh,
I had no idea she was masturbating 

303
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,270
because she wasn't in the tub.
Just so specific.

304
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:48,271
Masturbate in your own soup.
It's hard.

305
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,560
Like,
just,

306
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,190
that's what I feel about tubs

307
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:57,190
anyway.
You're not really even totally clean 

308
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,730
your pussy and asshole soup here.
You're making tea.

309
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,720
It's going to take a shower after you 
take a bath and you're making tea.

310
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,760
Puts her pussy too.
So it's just this.

311
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,860
I mean,
we're comics so I'm fascinated by like 

312
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,760
people's deep dark secrets and I feel 
like masturbation is that lab.

313
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,590
We show our lives to everyone on social 
media.

314
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:16,950
You know what I eat?
You know where Mike,

315
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,060
your kids,
everyone.

316
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,610
You don't really do that,
but most people,

317
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,940
everything.
The one thing we don't know about 

318
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:24,940
anyone,
that's how they masturbate.

319
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,650
Well,
I think also it highlights the problem 

320
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,771
with those focus groups.
Those focus groups are filled with 

321
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:33,341
morons because most people that are 
doing a person who needs $50 cash right 

322
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:37,180
now and we'll go watch a movie in the 
valley for 50 bucks.

323
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:38,260
And by the way,
if you're listening to this,

324
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:38,840
you're like,
hey man,

325
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:39,500
I'm fucking normal.

326
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm just broke.
It's not human.

327
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,410
But you know the people that you're 
doing it with.

328
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,790
Okay.
Let's be honest.

329
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,990
I have a complicated relationship with 
focus groups because we're comics.

330
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:52,991
I love anonymous strangers.
Feedback is how I seek the truth and 

331
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:57,460
that's who I listened to.
Like I would rather anonymous strangers 

332
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,420
feedback than like a network executive 
who's like got all these,

333
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,650
you know,
I'm sort of preconceived ideas of what a

334
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:08,651
show should be like based on some 
formulaic thing that worked 10 years 

335
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:08,651
ago.
You know,

336
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:10,580
I let the involuntary laugh.
That's to me where the truth is.

337
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:15,581
So I have a complicated relationship 
with focus groups because I really do 

338
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:17,270
trust strangers.
Well you kind of have to,

339
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,040
if you're a comic,
you know,

340
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,050
because we're,
we have a weird art forum in that we're 

341
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,241
one of the very few art forms that 
requires other people to make it form 

342
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:31,370
people we've never met and know nothing 
about and put complete trust in.

343
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,570
Yeah.
If we don't do that,

344
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,130
they won't be good.
No,

345
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,420
just.
I mean you can't write,

346
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,420
you can write a few jokes on their own 
and they come out really good.

347
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,320
Yeah.
Can never write it.

348
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:44,321
Act like have you ever.
And I know a bunch of comics that do 

349
00:16:44,321 --> 00:16:44,660
this,
like if I'm sitting in a vacuum,

350
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:46,070
like writing jokes,
I can be like,

351
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:46,940
oh,
this is money.

352
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:47,870
And you go,
do you know,

353
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,880
it's very.
I mean I feel like I'm to.

354
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,880
I definitely have.
I'm usually pretty close,

355
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:57,881
but there are times that it's just like 
there is not a linear relationship with 

356
00:16:57,881 --> 00:16:59,030
what.
I think that's why you're having,

357
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:04,031
as you just put a giant scored much mct 
oil.

358
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,530
It's like cream.
Look,

359
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:08,000
it's great.
Looks good in there.

360
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,660
It is good.
That is too much.

361
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,930
You just your,
your.

362
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,110
Trust me.
That's not too much.

363
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,670
Are you sure?
Yeah.

364
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,550
What I'm talking about is like I want to
know how much you drank.

365
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,340
A lot.
That was an overdose.

366
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,990
Well,
have you ever seen those smooth?

367
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:25,210
Half a bottle you've ever seen?
The smoothies that I put up on 

368
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:25,210
Instagram,
I call the bulk loads.

369
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:25,210
Yes.
Those are the.

370
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,620
That's the problem because is also a 
brand of porn by the way.

371
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,330
I put like a quarter of a cup of mct oil
in that.

372
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,570
Is there I don't know anything about.
Is there a point where your body stops 

373
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,510
metabolizing something because it's 
gotten enough of it?

374
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,430
Yes,
but I hit that point.

375
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,450
Yeah,
that's the thing.

376
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,640
One hundred percent.
Got It.

377
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:44,930
I get it all.
Okay,

378
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,190
well this,
that squirt

379
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,360
right there,
that little baby squared,

380
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,550
that's enough.
You're a monster.

381
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,030
You're shrek hand literally in one 
squirt,

382
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,410
released half of that bottle.
I've never seen anything like that.

383
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,440
I.
I shutter at the idea of human jerking 

384
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,400
off.
Literally feels I have sympathy for your

385
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:13,401
staff.
Strange noise and what you just did to 

386
00:18:13,401 --> 00:18:14,460
that bottle was intense.
You're addicted.

387
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,520
Needs a day off.
I'm never going to look at my hands and 

388
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:19,520
never,
never touch it again.

389
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,060
I'm,
I'm your Dick is filing a restraining 

390
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,060
order against your hand.
Thank God for flush loads,

391
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,400
but used to be our sponsor really way 
back in the day.

392
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:31,401
It was our first sponsor.
Only sponsor that we had was the 

393
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,230
flashlight.
I remember I had sort of an Aha moment 

394
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,800
when one of my specials,
I think it was on comedy central.

395
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:39,801
You kind of find out who you are based 
on who buys advertising time on your 

396
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:39,801
show.

397
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:42,770
Oh yeah.
I did some special on comedy central and

398
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,600
the ads were all like Adam and eve.
Sex Toys.

399
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,770
Val Drag,
so there it is.

400
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,650
That's who I am.
Good to know the,

401
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:53,040
the,
the focus group thing.

402
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,910
I just can't imagine that no one would 
understand that a woman with her hands 

403
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,290
in her pants watching a computer 
wouldn't be masturbating.

404
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,320
They were very confused and less guys 
assume that women don't masturbate to 

405
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,320
porn.
Yeah,

406
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,520
that's a good point.
I,

407
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,790
I don't know.
Yeah,

408
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:13,791
I don't know.
I don't talk about that kind of stuff 

409
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:13,791
with my girlfriends and it don't know.
Nope,

410
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,490
we don't.
I'm not like,

411
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:16,240
what do you masturbate?
You know,

412
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,790
you guys don't get that all the time.
Oh yeah.

413
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,230
We joke about it.
No,

414
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,820
like we prepare some guys prepare.
I don't even talk about sex with guys,

415
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:29,780
with my girlfriends.
I talking about it on podcast.

416
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,050
Strangers don't talk about with your 
girlfriends.

417
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,160
Is that odd?
It's not odd.

418
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,200
It's just like.
I mean I'll definitely sometimes try to 

419
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,200
corroborate likable,
like,

420
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,660
Hey,
is this happening or is this just,

421
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,540
you know,
is this a thing?

422
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,040
And they're like,
you get smacked.

423
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,230
Yeah,
like [inaudible].

424
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,980
That's the new.
The posties sorry.

425
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:52,050
Oh No,
I hate the word Pussy and sexual 

426
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,380
assault.
I don't hate it.

427
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:54,450
It just feels like it's reserved.
It's just not,

428
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,300
it's only for sex.
I don't use it in a colloquial way,

429
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:59,130
but I don't have another substitute for 
it.

430
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,850
Cause Vagina is a bummer.
Vagina is like an ant.

431
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,090
Dad's from Mississippi.
Nonsexual.

432
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,040
Oh,
it's a vagina or a clinical.

433
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,230
Uh,
I don't have a synonym for it,

434
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:16,860
but slapping k like I always know what's
the new trend in porn because it'll,

435
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,180
you know,
slapping,

436
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,840
they'll,
you'll get like a slap that doesn't seem

437
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:26,841
like it was.
I don't know if it's like a am I in 

438
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:28,941
trouble and I'm not sure what.
What am I just slapped your deck.

439
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Would you not feel good?
I don't know why anybody would like to 

440
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,201
get one man.
I just think guys assume that since we 

441
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:41,811
give birth in that such a shocking 
amount of pain that we can endure 

442
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:41,811
anything.
I don't know.

443
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:46,420
It's a weird little.
Well there's something that happens in 

444
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:46,420
porn for sure,
where they escalate,

445
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,040
where it used to be just people

446
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,690
having sex.
If you go back to old porn,

447
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,680
it would be like a secretary and a boss 
and I'm so tense and the guy gives her a

448
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:55,020
back massage.
Next thing you know,

449
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,040
they're having just regular sex and then
somewhere along the line it became like 

450
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,330
gagging and slapping and fucking 
coughing

451
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,030
from one to the other,
which is super dangerous.

452
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,660
A Uti wait is septic infection.
That's all I can think of.

453
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,780
Stuff that's like you should not do in 
real life.

454
00:21:11,781 --> 00:21:13,280
It's they're really setting a bad 
example.

455
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,700
Terrible example.
Guess who's having to suffer this guy?

456
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,120
It's us.
We're the ones that have to be like me 

457
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,120
and then we're like,
yeah,

458
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,350
well,
I mean we just have to play defense 

459
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:26,350
because it's.
There's always a.

460
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:26,350
What point did you watch today?
It's like,

461
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,660
what am I getting hit?
Am I getting what I.

462
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,140
can you please teach me Jujitsu just so 
I can get through.

463
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:37,170
That's going to take along.
It's not something you can teach 

464
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,811
somebody.
It's not like this is the letter a and 

465
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:39,811
cursive.

466
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:42,300
I have a question.
I was thinking about this because I 

467
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,091
always am trying to equate like our 
primordial instincts that we have not 

468
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:50,101
evolved past and with modern technology 
and alarm systems and how we get out 

469
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:53,290
those impulses in the modern world like,
you know,

470
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,800
did you hear about these food trucks 
that were in downtown la?

471
00:21:56,801 --> 00:22:01,801
They're like these awesome food trucks 
who in everyday or at a different 

472
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:02,440
location and guys go on twitter to find 
where they are and they go,

473
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,550
so I'm like,
that's hunting,

474
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,620
right?
That's the closest thing these guys have

475
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:07,300
done hunting.
If they're not you.

476
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,550
Right?
That's a weird way of thinking,

477
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,840
isn't it?
I didn't.

478
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,320
I never equated that before,
but I guess kind of if men have a 

479
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,640
primordial need to chase things and go 
kill and slay or whatever it is.

480
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,360
So if there's an inherent need to be 
violent,

481
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,420
let's say,
and people don't get to do what you do 

482
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:27,880
and a lot of people that you talk to do,
do they.

483
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,540
I guess here's my question.
Do people who get the impulse to fight 

484
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,120
out either professionally or 
recreationally,

485
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:39,000
are they less violence sexually?
Like do they not need to do,

486
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,600
does it have to come out somewhere?

487
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,430
I would imagine they would be less 
violence actually.

488
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:44,490
Yeah,
because they get that.

489
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,360
I would imagine there'd be less violent 
overall agree because they get to purge 

490
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:50,360
it somehow.
Yeah.

491
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,850
And well I think road rage when you see 
people in road rage incidents,

492
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,680
the likelihood of them coming straight 
from a Jujitsu class and having road 

493
00:22:59,680 --> 00:22:59,840
rage is almost zero.
Yes.

494
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,370
Because when I'm coming home from 
Jujitsu and someone cuts me off,

495
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:03,510
I'm like,
Oh Dick,

496
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,760
that's it.
Duke.

497
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,690
So much.

498
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,290
You know what your threshold is for how 
much violence or not even violence.

499
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,510
Uh,
I don't know what testosterone,

500
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:16,570
whatever it is.
More tension than releasing it.

501
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,610
Yeah,
I think it's more.

502
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,000
Most people never get to release it.

503
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,230
No.
Most people don't.

504
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:25,231
And I think our bodies,
I always describe our bodies as like a 

505
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:27,841
leaky battery,
that we have a certain amount of reward 

506
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:28,720
systems that are built into our bodies 
fight and flight and worrying about,

507
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,980
you know,
how to gather food and worrying about 

508
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:33,980
incoming tribes.
They're going to rape and kill us.

509
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,360
Yeah.
And I think those,

510
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,390
those things are just ingrained in our 
DNA and they don't get met or even 

511
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,410
addressed at all.
In modern society where you have A.

512
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,510
I have a friend of mine was a really bad
neck.

513
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,920
His neck is all fucked up and

514
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,930
he works at a desk all day.
He's not.

515
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,960
He doesn't hardly exercises.
He does look a little bit of exercise.

516
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,950
Then I'm like,
man,

517
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:54,410
your body has demands and you're not 
meeting it,

518
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:57,480
but just sit in there with shitty 
posture at your desk.

519
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,750
Sitting is the new smoking.
Yeah,

520
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:01,930
that's a lot of people say that.
Oh it is?

521
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,680
Yeah.
Well that's why we're in these chairs.

522
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,790
These things are called [inaudible].
They're from Ergo depot.

523
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,670
No,
you would be really numb.

524
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,280
Then you would need a slap down there.
It's very distracting.

525
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:18,290
It makes sense.
These are forcing you to sit like this,

526
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,900
you know?
And they noticed it.

527
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,090
Underwire bra today.
So that forces me to do that.

528
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,480
Pushes down.
Well no,

529
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,530
it's like it's like three harpoons that 
are just.

530
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:35,910
And if you move they sort of Jam India.
What does that.

531
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,950
Is it a posture thing?
No,

532
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:43,150
it's just like a masochism misogynistic,
a lingerie.

533
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,380
So just to make your tits perky.
Yeah.

534
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:47,660
I haven't done laundry,
my cleaning lady,

535
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:53,170
so I'm improvising and wearing things 
that I wouldn't normally wear and I 

536
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,771
can't believe women wear this all the 
time because I normally don't wear 

537
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:56,771
underwire.
No.

538
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:56,771
Does that.
Here's,

539
00:24:56,771 --> 00:25:01,661
I always wanted to know this.
Do Support Bras actually support your 

540
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,620
breasts and keep them from starting to 
sag?

541
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,950
Yes.
Like any part of the skit,

542
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,180
like you know,
if you hold something up.

543
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:13,181
So I know a lot of women who have 
pendulous breasts who went to sleep so 

544
00:25:13,181 --> 00:25:17,351
that they don't fully get beaten down by
gravity and then you have a cadence if 

545
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,520
you go Africa style,
there's just.

546
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,540
Yeah,
there's no way around that.

547
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,640
But this,
unless you were a sport,

548
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,460
this is just more like I normally never 
wear underwire,

549
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,710
um,
because it makes me a bad person,

550
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,900
but because you're in pain,
I'm just,

551
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,220
it's just uncomfortable.

552
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:40,270
I'm used to thongs.
I've gotten numb in that area and just 

553
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:40,620
had to acquiesce to them,
look,

554
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,630
your butt crack.
But yeah,

555
00:25:42,631 --> 00:25:47,631
it's like if,
I mean basically there's a certain type 

556
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:47,780
of you getting so used to my throat 
today,

557
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,640
mct oil.
No,

558
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,900
but I,
I have gotten so it's amazing and I'm 

559
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:55,900
just always fascinated by and we're 
seeing it,

560
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,760
you know,
I think everyone's sort of Zeitgeisty 

561
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:00,760
word right now.
Normalization or desensitization.

562
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,531
I'm obsessed with how we acclimate 
because I think it's our human instinct 

563
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,670
to acclimate to some kind of pain or 
lower tolerance to,

564
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:12,770
um,
deal with a consistent pain or 

565
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,881
discomfort or whatever.
We sort of have this amazing ability to 

566
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:17,100
adapt.
And uh,

567
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,490
I didn't wear thongs,
didn't wear thongs.

568
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:22,190
I was resisting and resisting it.
Finally started wearing them.

569
00:26:22,191 --> 00:26:27,191
They were so uncomfortable for a couple 
months and then I forgot I had went on 

570
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:28,260
and peed through one.
Once that's through,

571
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,340
through one.
I sat down on the toilet.

572
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:35,350
Just thought you were naked.
How little I felt it you on any kind of 

573
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,350
medication at this time?
You know,

574
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:40,121
I should have been.
I really should have been on anti 

575
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:40,121
psychotics.
I can't believe you pete.

576
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:42,950
I got the super light,
like Cammo ones.

577
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,400
Actually under armour makes them more 
like workout ones that are are,

578
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,670
they're called Cammo.
I think.

579
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,770
They're not like a

580
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,190
camouflage.
Not.

581
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,840
I'm not hunting.
Yeah.

582
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,550
Under armour makes a lot of hunting 
gear.

583
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,320
Oh,
does it now?

584
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,990
I didn't know that they started making.
They started.

585
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,030
They did not have to be the face of that
campaign.

586
00:27:01,031 --> 00:27:04,660
I can't imagine why,
but if you wanted to try a new career,

587
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,730
it was looking for women to get involved
in hunting.

588
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,720
Oh really?
Yeah.

589
00:27:07,721 --> 00:27:10,330
That's like a big thing like pretty 
girls don't go hunting.

590
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,890
Is that like,
is that sexy?

591
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,670
Um,
I think some people think it is,

592
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,500
but what,
what it is,

593
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,690
is unusual to see these girls with full 
makeup on,

594
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,330
with like really well applied camera on 
their face.

595
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:27,331
So it's kind of obvious.
And then they have like a deadline next 

596
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:30,481
to them and then they don't take these 
facebook photos and it gets really 

597
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:30,481
weird.
Like there was a girl,

598
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:35,160
she was pretty famous for it because she
was a cheerleader in Texas and she shot 

599
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,740
in Lyon and like Ricky Gervais' and all 
these people went crazy on,

600
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:39,610
you're attacking her.

601
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,800
And,
and it became the Kendall Jenner,

602
00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:45,950
I think is her name.
And was that famous Kardashians?

603
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,350
My right.
You might.

604
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,130
No Way.
There's no kindle something or.

605
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,950
I mean that's the most endearing ever 
done.

606
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:59,020
What's that?
Kendall Jones Jones is pretty close.

607
00:27:59,050 --> 00:27:59,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

608
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:00,760
I'm,
I'm so out of the loop.

609
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,910
Someone was trying to explore you in the
Kardashians loop.

610
00:28:03,911 --> 00:28:06,610
I'd be.
Which one's the one that had the.

611
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,340
There it is.
There's the girl with the lion.

612
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,310
Like,
see?

613
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:14,311
So there's something.
There's something weird about like this 

614
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:14,311
picture right here.
Look,

615
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:14,311
look at this picture.
I want to look at.

616
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:17,600
Just take a look real quick.
I've ruined like my week.

617
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,560
Gosh,
you'd be fun.

618
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,200
Sexy pose with a bow in a deadline.
Yeah.

619
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,140
I can't look at it.
And by the way,

620
00:28:26,141 --> 00:28:28,330
that lion is,
um,

621
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,750
you know,
lines up with.

622
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,810
There's a weird thing about the hunting 
lions thing too,

623
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:34,780
because a lot of them,
they're in these high fence places where

624
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:36,490
they go in.
These lines are kind of trapped in these

625
00:28:36,491 --> 00:28:41,491
areas.
And sometimes they actually released a 

626
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:42,430
line the day of the hunt.
So there's line had been in a cage,

627
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,470
Scott release the line and this woman 
goes out and shoots the.

628
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,480
I mean,
I don't know if that was the case with 

629
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:50,480
her person,
whoever,

630
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,400
man.
Sometimes we'll go out and shoot the 

631
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,261
line.
The line literally has no idea what's 

632
00:28:55,261 --> 00:28:55,261
going on.
It's not even a free range line.

633
00:28:55,261 --> 00:28:55,270
Yeah.

634
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:00,270
So to me that's a mentally ill person.
But my question for you is that,

635
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,160
is there something primordial about.
Because I think,

636
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,570
you know,
we are,

637
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,190
I think inherently,
and this is going to sound wrong or it's

638
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,060
going to sound like feminist or 
whatever,

639
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:16,230
but like there's a lot of evidence that 
we're a matriarchal species,

640
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:21,231
not that women should have more power,
but that were sort of designed to like 

641
00:29:21,231 --> 00:29:21,360
Orca whales,
lions,

642
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:24,180
like female lions do all the hunting and
the men just,

643
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:27,090
it's not economical for their energy 
because they're so big to do hunting.

644
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:30,120
They'd have to kill him twice as much 
food or whatever they for protection.

645
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,170
Yeah.
And so,

646
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,600
um,
and fucking and whatever.

647
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,600
So is there something,
a,

648
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,820
some sort of reptilian attraction to 
seeing a woman go hunt food even though 

649
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,240
it's ironically a lion,
you know?

650
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,150
No,
I don't think so.

651
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:46,390
Is it like watching a woman cook,
watching a woman cook is probably sexy,

652
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,420
but is watching them hunt the same thing
but I don't.

653
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,260
I don't think so.

654
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,260
Yeah.
But maybe it's just maybe a varies.

655
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:55,410
I think it's more in lines of watching a
woman cage fight.

656
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,240
Like there's some really pretty women.

657
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:02,300
The fight now is that because I'm always
sort of in this thing and people always 

658
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:06,670
tell me like I have Alpha vibe and 
that's not sexy to men or it is.

659
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,460
Or is it case by case or is it a 
generalization?

660
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:10,380
I'm just always interested.

661
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,780
Well,
I think what you are is powerful and 

662
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:15,880
that's scary to people that are 
insecure.

663
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,230
You're,
you're a go getter.

664
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:19,390
You're constantly doing things and 
you're like.

665
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,750
I would imagine that a guy who doesn't 
test himself or a person who's not 

666
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,270
accomplished would be very insecure 
around someone who's got more,

667
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:33,990
more ambition and more drive and more 
irons in the fire than they do so they 

668
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,210
would feel insecure insignia,

669
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,020
again,
because my engine is insecurity.

670
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,460
It is ironic.
Yeah.

671
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,220
That's what fuels the fire.
But if you were secure,

672
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:44,650
would you be as ambitious or would you 
be exactly the same?

673
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:46,120
I don't know if I can even entertain 
that.

674
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:48,590
Hypothetical [inaudible] the idea of 
being secure so far.

675
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,890
What if someone came out with a security
pill?

676
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,870
Yep,
and he took that back.

677
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,790
If they have that,
that's a chatterbox pill.

678
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:58,600
That's what that is.
Yeah,

679
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:00,250
that's true.
That's so let's start a business.

680
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,190
Dude.
I'm telling you,

681
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:07,390
man,
we need to go into business together.

682
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:08,640
I've got a good idea,
but amazing.

683
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:13,650
I know I is a co op.
That one working with vitamin company 

684
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,510
branding out of China.
Branding.

685
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,290
Yeah.
You did an amazing job with your brand.

686
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,120
Whitney will go.
Thank you so much.

687
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Amazing.
Even heard someone refer to you as your 

688
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:24,600
brand.
Yes.

689
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:24,600
That is.

690
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,230
That's such a bizarre way of putting 
things.

691
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,820
It's got such a pejorative.
We're,

692
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,840
but we're comics so we have an allergy 
to anything corny like we can say with 

693
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,560
like,
we can say it,

694
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,420
but we have to do it with like an eye 
roll,

695
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:40,450
like you have a very strong brand,
but,

696
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,660
but part of your brand is not being the 
guy who goes,

697
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:46,030
me and my brand,
part of my brand is not having a brand.

698
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,470
You do have one,
I guess incredibly strong,

699
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:53,700
clear one that anybody could do,
you know,

700
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,360
like say in one sentence,
but part of it is because you're so 

701
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,950
authentic and anti,
like,

702
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,840
you know,
conscientious,

703
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,650
calculated marketing that the word is 
anathema to your brand.

704
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,140
Well,
that's,

705
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,710
that's one of the big issues in the 
quote unquote hunting community about a 

706
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,010
lot of these girls that are involved in 
this,

707
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:14,990
uh,
this hunting like you don't know.

708
00:32:14,991 --> 00:32:16,800
So I'm going to explain it to you.
There's,

709
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,000
there's this whole movement where these 
pretty girls have,

710
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,740
I mean,
maybe some of them are.

711
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:24,800
I mean for sure some of them are 
authentic.

712
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:27,920
I don't want to discredit the ones that 
are authentic,

713
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,090
but a lot of them

714
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,490
are essentially using social media.
I really want to understand the,

715
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,280
and this is maybe a generalization about
men and women,

716
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:40,010
but do you think women have the

717
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:45,740
DNA and the true reward system?
Are they getting dopamine from hunt?

718
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,240
Are they inherit hunters the same way 
women like playing sports,

719
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,640
they would love hunting.
Interesting.

720
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:57,910
Yeah.
The same way people like very 

721
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:57,910
challenging and difficult things to 
offer you.

722
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,110
A massive reward will not do it,
but sports is.

723
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:04,250
There's teamwork which is a gives us 
dopamine and adrenaline,

724
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,280
you know,
because I'm sort of interested in women 

725
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,041
in general that do things like make out 
with other guys when they're not 

726
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,970
lesbians.
Just to get another guy's attention.

727
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,140
Girls.
I'm sorry,

728
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:15,970
what did I say?
Yes.

729
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,620
Make up with other girls.
Make out with other girls.

730
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:24,050
Like are women hunting because they want
to or because it's they feel socially.

731
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:29,120
I think there's both.
I mean I think we would obviously we'd 

732
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,080
make a massive generalization.
Women do this because I hate that shit.

733
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,700
I hate when people say the left does 
this or the right.

734
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,530
Does that?
She gets goofy.

735
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,840
Yeah.
I've never met someone that does it,

736
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:39,610
so I have no.
Right.

737
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,790
I know a lot of women that do a lot of 
them and some of them are unquestionably

738
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:48,791
authentic,
but some of them are unquestionably 

739
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:51,250
targeting social media and these 
specific avenues of getting famous and 

740
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:55,340
making a living and inside the hunting 
community,

741
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,520
it's a very hotly debated subject about 
like whether or not some of these women 

742
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,980
are legit and who is legit and who's 
like,

743
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,870
what if their knowledge it does it 
matter or no,

744
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,880
it doesn't matter.
Why is it different than a girl grows a 

745
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:10,880
fitness freak,
you know?

746
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,430
A girl just likes doing squats.
I mean we're designed to keep.

747
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,120
If we get attention for something,
our brain just keeps doing it.

748
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:19,970
There was a vice thing about that today 
that I retweeted a thirsty pictures.

749
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,850
Yeah.
You need to answer girls.

750
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,890
Girls like with bras on.
I'm like,

751
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:26,290
why did they do that?
Like why do they.

752
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:27,450
Because they're getting likes.
Yeah.

753
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:31,340
Why do they have their ass hanging out 
with a thong with the legs,

754
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,700
like sort of exposed in bed where 
they're pretending that they're sleeping

755
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,880
and millions of people looking at them 
because we like it,

756
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,560
you know?
Yeah.

757
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,410
I mean what got us attention is what 
we're going to keep doing.

758
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:43,550
Hashtag Thursday.
Yeah.

759
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:48,551
Who is the perpetrator?
Is that the person doing it or the 

760
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:48,920
person enabling it?
Well,

761
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,890
I don't want anybody to stop because I 
like looking at those pictures.

762
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,560
Do you follow that on instagram?
I follow a lot of hoes.

763
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,360
Really?
What does that do for you?

764
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,690
Not much.
Like I follow a lot of dummies.

765
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,700
Two PM.
Do you want to like I pm just 

766
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,080
specifically right after lunch and just 
like blood holes after lunch and you 

767
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,680
know there's not any buttholes on 
instagram.

768
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,040
Instagram is all.
It has to be like pg cocktail yet.

769
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,290
But is that distracting,
do you think?

770
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:20,291
It's because I'm fascinated by what we 
put in our brain and the sort of way of 

771
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:24,580
wires our brain.
Does that just sort of make you 

772
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:24,580
exacerbate the obsession with sex?
Let me,

773
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,960
let me go over my thing right now 
because for me I follow I think more 

774
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,080
than a thousand people.
Oh,

775
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:34,820
so this is not curated fall 1000,
224 people.

776
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,340
So that's what I try to do with my 
instagram

777
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,250
feed is have it be a cascade of 
humanity.

778
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,820
I follow people who are animal rights 
activists and vegans.

779
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:47,130
You want to know people who are 
bodybuilders.

780
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,170
I've followed people who are fighting.
I fall.

781
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,810
If you looked at like when I,
you know,

782
00:35:50,811 --> 00:35:54,300
you do the search and the algorithm 
tries to find out like why you are.

783
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,240
It's fucking chaos.
What the fuck I am.

784
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:02,390
There's flowers and dead deer and guys 
getting head kicked and muscle cars and 

785
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,530
it looks like I'm a fucking crazy 
person,

786
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:08,070
which I probably am,
but what I do is I tried to.

787
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,380
If you have anything remotely 
interesting,

788
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:13,050
I just follow you and then I unfollow 
people all the time too.

789
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:18,110
This is interesting about you because 
this to me illustrates an absence of 

790
00:36:18,331 --> 00:36:19,770
ego.
Like you're very.

791
00:36:19,771 --> 00:36:23,310
Like I'm open to anything.
I just want to know how everybody thinks

792
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,800
and that's so cool because I definitely 
have an ego,

793
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:28,900
but I beat the fuck out of it.
You're,

794
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,000
you.
It's interesting.

795
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:31,440
I mean maybe it's,
you know,

796
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,160
you know more than I do,
but I find that I get very threatened by

797
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,950
things that I didn't upset me.
Like you just saw that,

798
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:39,520
like I said,
it's like this is going to be,

799
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,480
my whole day is going to be dedicated to
like obsessing about,

800
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:43,470
you know,
um,

801
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:48,471
so I think I'm doing something that's 
kind of under the guise of self 

802
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:50,280
protection or boundaries.
But I actually ended up robbing myself a

803
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:53,940
little bit by like I went through that 
discovery page and there's photos that I

804
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:56,790
don't want to see because I do a lot of 
dog rescue.

805
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:01,790
And then you ended up getting a lot of 
like seeing head ahead of dogs and the 

806
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,240
Chinese dogs and I just,
I don't want to see it.

807
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:07,390
The dog festival too.
I'm hypervigilant and I'm just to like,

808
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,460
I have,
do,

809
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,630
you know,
trauma survivors.

810
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,970
We don't have the same ability to calm 
ourselves down.

811
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,240
And so it just will,
all the aftermath is just too much for 

812
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,340
me.
So I went in and I,

813
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:21,240
on the discovery page,
you can put see less photos like this.

814
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,270
So I'm now narrowing my,
uh,

815
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,420
sort of as my new puppy named Marshall 
Marshall.

816
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:36,300
He's a golden retriever.
The best.

817
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:39,240
He's the sweetest,
best security system you will ever have.

818
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,510
The Sky for dogs.
I mean for bark.

819
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,350
Just having to.
Yeah,

820
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,150
I had a uh,
someone breaking in my house.

821
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:46,560
Is that your first dog?
No,

822
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,240
this was like,
you have a ton of dogs.

823
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,180
Yeah.
I know so much about you,

824
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:51,850
but I know nothing.

825
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,560
But I had this guy,
uh,

826
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,790
the security guy,
uh,

827
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,810
come to my house and he said the best 
security system is putting chimes on all

828
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:04,950
of your door knobs because people to 
break in,

829
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,660
they,
you know,

830
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:10,670
they expect an alarm and then they know 
they have like three minutes or 

831
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:10,670
something,
but if they open a door knob and there's

832
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,160
some dream catcher,
but you know,

833
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,250
making a bunch of noise,
they freak out.

834
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,420
And then.
Yeah.

835
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:19,680
And then a dog dogs are good and you've 
got big dogs,

836
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,460
pit bulls.
Yeah,

837
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,620
that's a good move for sure.
Yeah.

838
00:38:22,621 --> 00:38:23,730
They've taught me a lot.
You know,

839
00:38:23,731 --> 00:38:28,310
for me it's like the thing with me is 
that I'm not as sort of mental Adam,

840
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,320
the same like functional mental acumen 
that you have a and all the work that I 

841
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:36,520
do to try to rewire my brain.
It's very hard to practice,

842
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,350
uh,
in the problem,

843
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,880
you know,
it's very hard to practice,

844
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,580
uh,
you know,

845
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,800
without something where the 
ramifications aren't going to be huge 

846
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:46,800
like practicing on people.

847
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:46,990
It's just sort of,
you know,

848
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,520
if people are so triggering that it's 
hard to get out of the fight or flight a

849
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,540
sort of fear mindset if you're with the 
very kind of person that triggers you.

850
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:59,890
So animals are a great way for me to 
work on the things that I'm working on.

851
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,260
How do people trigger you won't way.
Um,

852
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,620
I have sort of like,
just because of how I grew up,

853
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:10,621
I grew up in a alcoholic home and anyone
that has an authority sort of Vibe,

854
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,920
uh,
my brain and we all I think tend to kind

855
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:17,140
of do this if we're not like checking 
ourselves in our,

856
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,860
in our conscious mind.
We recreate our childhood circumstances.

857
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:25,861
So I sometimes I,
I'm just trying to make sure I don't go 

858
00:39:25,861 --> 00:39:28,390
through my life where everybody's a 
projection of what happened to me.

859
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,140
Just sort of being in this moment 
instead of this network executives,

860
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:34,360
my dad and this,
you know,

861
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,660
the guy that runs this comedy club is my
mom,

862
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:39,410
you know,
we sort of have my,

863
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:44,570
our brains go,
I know what this is and then we start 

864
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:44,570
doing her old behaviors are,
are,

865
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,240
you know,
the sort of um,

866
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,120
you know,
protection mechanisms that we developed.

867
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,060
And horses are actually helping me the 
most with it.

868
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:54,160
But dogs help too.
Wow.

869
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,120
For me it's a,
it doesn't really happen anymore.

870
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:03,121
But when I was younger and places and 
people that I knew when I was a loser 

871
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:04,090
would make me feel like I was a loser.

872
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:04,500
Of course,
you're,

873
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,450
you're just time travel back and all of 
a sudden you're eight years old.

874
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:08,950
I'm still a loser.
I got to get away from you.

875
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,270
I made it happen.
I mean,

876
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:11,320
it's just,
it's so.

877
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,840
And I'm working on,
you know,

878
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,980
I think there's a lot of advantages to 
being hypersensitive.

879
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:16,060
I think that's probably what we're good 
at,

880
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:17,920
what we do for a living.
We make observations.

881
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:19,630
We have to be sensitive.
We comedians,

882
00:40:19,631 --> 00:40:21,610
the idea is to see things that no one 
else sees.

883
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:26,080
And um,
but I find myself struggling a lot as I,

884
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:31,230
you know,
do what I do for a living when I deal 

885
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,020
with ostensible authority figures,
recreating my childhood circumstances.

886
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:37,021
And I also had an.
I'm interested in your opinion or view 

887
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:38,990
on this as a dre.
I mean,

888
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I have a very real addiction to 
adrenaline and it doesn't manifest in 

889
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,590
mma or the kind of adrenaline that you 
experienced and see.

890
00:40:47,591 --> 00:40:51,100
But I had um,
epigenetic imprinting like,

891
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:53,920
which is when in the womb,
your mom has a lot of stress,

892
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,170
cortisol and adrenaline.
The baby gets addicted to it,

893
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,650
so just like crack or anything,
we can be addicted to neurochemicals.

894
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:04,820
So from a very early age I had a really 
high tolerance for adrenaline and I find

895
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:08,170
myself or found myself not so much 
anymore,

896
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:11,600
like in these just really traumatic 
situations that um,

897
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,990
so that I get because adrenaline turns 
into dopamine.

898
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,310
So

899
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,220
how do we prove that that's what happens
to the child?

900
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:21,450
Because I would just assume that yeah,
how much of it would just be genetic and

901
00:41:21,451 --> 00:41:26,451
how much of it would be circumstantial.
And how do you prove that while this 

902
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:28,200
woman's been under stress in the womb?
Because I think you would have to.

903
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,800
One thing you realize when you do have 
children is that every kid is different.

904
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,030
You know,
my,

905
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:38,190
tonight we are going to stay.
It's probably different because the 

906
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:38,190
first one,
the mom is probably like,

907
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,370
I've never done this before.
The second one,

908
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,420
they're like,
I got this,

909
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,070
you know,
by the third one that you know,

910
00:41:42,071 --> 00:41:43,900
they don't give a shit.
They hardly.

911
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:48,901
Yeah,
you and the MCT oil mct and knock it 

912
00:41:48,901 --> 00:41:50,620
out,
lube up the box and push it out,

913
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,400
give it a slap,

914
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:58,990
send it on way data the year Joe Rogan 
hashtags about the posts.

915
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,500
Yeah.
I just,

916
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:09,850
I think that there's,
there's most certainly got to be some 

917
00:42:10,171 --> 00:42:15,171
way that nature prepares the human for 
the circumstances it's going to face as 

918
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:15,171
a child.
Totally.

919
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:17,040
Michael Irvin was the first one to 
explain this to me.

920
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:17,880
You know,
the football player.

921
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,430
He and he and I were on.
I try to stay away from football.

922
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,760
He's a super nice guy,
but we,

923
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,400
he and I were on a flight once,
just randomly to Australia.

924
00:42:26,401 --> 00:42:28,310
It's one of those crazy 14 hour flights,
you know,

925
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:33,770
and we talked for a long time about this
because he's a big UFC fan and we just 

926
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:37,521
started talking about people that grow 
up in bad neighborhoods and children 

927
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:41,190
that grow up in abusive households that 
you developed this penchant for violence

928
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,880
like very early on,
like an addiction to violence and,

929
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:50,090
and then also he was saying that their 
trigger is so much the like their wic 

930
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,800
there,
their fuse is so much shorter person.

931
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:57,940
Yeah.
It's just like you have to be easily 

932
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,470
wiped away.
You got to be prepared to go crazy.

933
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:03,860
Whereas someone who grows up in a really
happy healthy environment where moms on 

934
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,710
Xanax,
everybody's fine,

935
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,480
you know,
and then then you like,

936
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,700
you can't get going,
you know,

937
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:12,701
so I wonder what's better.
Is it better to be hypersensitive and 

938
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:17,090
hyper fueled and,
and always ready to sprint and then 

939
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,751
figure out how to calm yourself?
Or is it better to be just some dough 

940
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:23,790
ball with no instincts at all?
That has to toughen up.

941
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,220
I mean,
I think that the answer is probably 

942
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,430
somewhere in between and the ideas to be
able to react to the circumstances.

943
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:33,940
You're in an inappropriate way,
so if you're in a dangerous situation to

944
00:43:33,941 --> 00:43:36,970
be able to go zero to 60 and defend 
yourself,

945
00:43:36,971 --> 00:43:41,971
but if you're not in a dangerous 
situation to know that and to stop 

946
00:43:41,971 --> 00:43:42,730
shadow boxing in a safe situation.
So for me,

947
00:43:42,731 --> 00:43:45,010
I found myself.
I grew up in a dangerous situation.

948
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,280
I was always at war.
The war was over and I continued to 

949
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,241
fight a war that wasn't happening.
It was one of those guys that was in 

950
00:43:54,241 --> 00:43:55,120
world war two and they find them on some
island outside of that.

951
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,330
It doesn't know.
The war's over covered in armor.

952
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,150
You know

953
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,390
this guy that was on an island,
he was on an island.

954
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,580
He didn't know the war was over.
He was a Japanese guy.

955
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:10,610
Wow.
He didn't know the war was over for 30 

956
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:10,610
years.
He will.

957
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:11,730
He was literally Tom Hanks in it on this
island.

958
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,770
Wow.
That's unbelievable.

959
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,600
I think it was 30.
That's how.

960
00:44:15,601 --> 00:44:20,601
That's how a lot of people that grew up 
in dysfunctional home sort of live and 

961
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:22,590
I'm done taking it out on employees,
employers,

962
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:25,020
boyfriend's friends.
It's not fair to them.

963
00:44:25,021 --> 00:44:30,021
You know,
one of the first things I heard in the 

964
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:31,320
12 step program I'm in is this guy said 
he was leading the meeting.

965
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:32,910
He was like,
the war is over.

966
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:33,960
You lost.

967
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,960
This is so great.
You know,

968
00:44:38,961 --> 00:44:43,160
it's like time to put the weapons down 
and start living a.

969
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,620
it's really just being appropriate.
So if you and I,

970
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,840
you know,
are in a relationship and you're like,

971
00:44:47,841 --> 00:44:52,841
Hey,
I got to step out and go do my podcast 

972
00:44:52,841 --> 00:44:52,841
and I start feeling abandoned and 
scared.

973
00:44:52,841 --> 00:44:54,550
That has nothing to do with you that's 
gets,

974
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:58,520
that gets weird.
It's not fair to you or relationships or

975
00:44:58,521 --> 00:45:03,521
whatever.
It's like I'm going to react to the 

976
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:03,521
present moment instead of what happened 
to me 20 years ago.

977
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:07,601
I don't want to be a puppet of like my 
parents failures and I'm just trying to 

978
00:45:07,601 --> 00:45:11,201
figure out a way.
So there are situations where you might 

979
00:45:11,201 --> 00:45:11,570
have to go zero to 60 and fight for 
yourself.

980
00:45:11,571 --> 00:45:14,510
But knowing when those situations are 
actually happening in when they're not.

981
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,830
Yeah,
I feel like it's better to be able to go

982
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:20,290
zero to 60 really quick and just manage 
it

983
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:22,640
and I know I can do that like that.
That.

984
00:45:22,641 --> 00:45:26,390
But in a conference room with three 
executives is,

985
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:30,620
it's not the time my,
in my mind,

986
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:35,650
it's never the time to be in a 
conference room with three executives 

987
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:35,650
when I'm there,
I'm like,

988
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:35,870
okay,
let's get out of here.

989
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,250
Let's go.
This is all fake

990
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,340
talk.
There's something.

991
00:45:38,341 --> 00:45:39,630
What's,
what is that like?

992
00:45:39,631 --> 00:45:44,631
Is there.
Is that because you're not getting 

993
00:45:44,631 --> 00:45:44,631
adrenaline?
Yeah,

994
00:45:44,631 --> 00:45:45,630
I'm scared to ever be them.
I'm scared to ever been locked into some

995
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,450
cubicle existence on a conscious level.
You never will be.

996
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,920
I know on a conscious level I'll never 
be there.

997
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:54,921
But I know that rational fear,
I'm around people that are dying of 

998
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:54,921
syphilis.
They're right there,

999
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:54,921
you know,
they're,

1000
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:55,590
they're,
they're rotting away.

1001
00:45:55,591 --> 00:45:59,610
They've got some ebola or something.
You've got some.

1002
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,990
So what in our field that's just called 
a law school degree.

1003
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,280
Um,
there was a guy that used to live next 

1004
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:09,280
door to me and I just call them bling,
bling,

1005
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,400
bling,
bling,

1006
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,000
bling,
bling would do,

1007
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:14,850
is talk about stuff that's all he could 
ever talk about.

1008
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:19,851
Like all this guy would do is talk about
objects and new cars and new things in 

1009
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,050
some way.
No,

1010
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:22,110
it was just,
he was retarded.

1011
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,430
It's boring.
It's boring.

1012
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,810
So it's a lack of adrenaline.
Well,

1013
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:27,420
I knew that he was trapped and this guy 
was working.

1014
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,280
I think he was an attorney.
I forget what he did,

1015
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,620
but he did.
He,

1016
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,850
all he was doing was working towards 
objects,

1017
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:34,550
getting new objects.
He had a nice house.

1018
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:39,850
He had a nice car,
but he's always wanted to talk about 

1019
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:42,021
cars and objects is done a lot of pain.
Well you left his wife and then she got 

1020
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:42,021
real crazy.

1021
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:46,680
Yeah.
He was trying to get internal needs met 

1022
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:46,680
with external things.
He was also probably trying to bond with

1023
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,590
you and he thought that was how.

1024
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,860
Maybe that probably makes sense.
It was probably just like cars hitting 

1025
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:52,860
yellow,
like me,

1026
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:52,860
like me,
like me.

1027
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,780
Oh that is a depressant.
So is Jewish,

1028
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,970
he's single,
he sounds like he's got a gut,

1029
00:47:00,971 --> 00:47:04,350
but whatever you fix her up or give them
this,

1030
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,990
get them on some phen phen some leftover
from the night and get some of that mct 

1031
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,200
oil and he'll shit his belly out.
Do you remember phen phen?

1032
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,320
Were you around during the fen phen 
phen.

1033
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,170
Phen phen was some crazy shit that they 
were giving girls in the 19 nineties.

1034
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,320
There was this one girl that I knew and 
she was a very cute girl.

1035
00:47:20,321 --> 00:47:22,480
She had a beautiful face but she had a 
food problem,

1036
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:24,070
you know,
whatever the areas.

1037
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,900
And she didn't weigh a lot.
Yeah.

1038
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,960
I mean she wasn't giant but she was 
probably five to 150 pounds.

1039
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,940
I'm not an athlete,
but I think I know where you're going.

1040
00:47:34,941 --> 00:47:36,240
Yeah,
she was thick.

1041
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,960
Yeah,
but not in the right way.

1042
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:38,570
I got it.

1043
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,410
Not In the right way.
Too much shadow.

1044
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,160
Thick wide belt.
Anyway.

1045
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:48,230
Got It.
I didn't see her for a long time and 

1046
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:48,830
then I saw her and she weighed a hundred
pounds.

1047
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,790
I mean literally she lost 50 pounds.
Wow.

1048
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,950
She was normal size.
I mean,

1049
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:55,340
not normal size.
She was in America.

1050
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,240
She was thin and attractive.
I was like,

1051
00:47:59,241 --> 00:48:01,910
what the fuck did you do?
And she's like,

1052
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:04,310
oh my doctor got me unfun fan.
And I was like,

1053
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:04,910
oh,
okay.

1054
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:09,100
I do not remember what the actual name 
of it.

1055
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:12,840
Philomena is a adrenaline chemical isn't
like speed.

1056
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,040
It's totally illegal now and people 
died.

1057
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,270
A lot of people die.
Here it is two o,

1058
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:23,090
p h e n fenfluramine Finn.

1059
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,500
When like diet pills get,
like dexa trim came out,

1060
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:28,670
which I,
I,

1061
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,480
I definitely took when I was 12.
But with.

1062
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,140
What does that,
just like?

1063
00:48:33,141 --> 00:48:33,500
Caffeine?

1064
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,820
No,
this is way harder than caffeine.

1065
00:48:35,821 --> 00:48:38,700
Go to lasting damage from fen phen.
But by the way,

1066
00:48:38,701 --> 00:48:41,760
this is gutter on adderall.
Now.

1067
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,520
I'm not telling anybody to not be on 
adderall,

1068
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:47,190
but I want you to listen to me.
Everybody was on adderall.

1069
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:49,440
Everybody was Dr.
told you need to be on adderall.

1070
00:48:49,441 --> 00:48:53,160
Yep.
You are on amphetamines.

1071
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,010
You are on spew.
Not Get it twisted.

1072
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,570
Don't get it twisted.
And you know,

1073
00:48:57,571 --> 00:49:00,120
if you're taking,
especially if you're taking it every day

1074
00:49:00,121 --> 00:49:05,121
or three or four times a week and you're
just going to develop a tolerance to it 

1075
00:49:05,121 --> 00:49:05,640
and then it just becomes an addiction.
You're on speed folks.

1076
00:49:05,641 --> 00:49:07,200
And you might be okay with me.
Look,

1077
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,420
you're talking to a guy just scored a 
bunch of mct oil and some coffee and

1078
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,710
actually occurring coffee.
I mean,

1079
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:13,460
look,
it's like,

1080
00:49:13,461 --> 00:49:16,700
I mean,
I have addiction in my dna if you know,

1081
00:49:16,701 --> 00:49:19,070
you don't.
I mean I would just explore that.

1082
00:49:19,071 --> 00:49:20,210
And also,
um,

1083
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,880
I'm trying to look at not the things I 
can add,

1084
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:26,270
but the things I can subtract.
So instead of taking adderall,

1085
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,140
why don't I just stop eating sugar?

1086
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:29,810
Same.
It happened.

1087
00:49:29,811 --> 00:49:34,040
Maybe there's some beneficial aspects of
adderall to some people.

1088
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,310
I'm willing to go there.
But you got to understand,

1089
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:39,840
I know so many moms that are on fucking 
adults,

1090
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:44,860
shocking dirt,
just so many of them and they're around 

1091
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:44,860
you and they're all like pepe.

1092
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:49,350
Fascinating to me because the people I 
know who take the money can't stop 

1093
00:49:50,611 --> 00:49:50,970
moving.

1094
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,900
Complaining about anxiety,
which I,

1095
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,570
I'm sort of fascinated by because I 
think that's kind of like,

1096
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,820
you know,
survival of the fittest.

1097
00:49:58,821 --> 00:50:03,821
We are the fittest and the most anxious 
one because the most anxious people and 

1098
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:06,450
tribes were the ones that survived 
because they knew lions were,

1099
00:50:06,451 --> 00:50:06,750
you know.
Well,

1100
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:11,830
I had to explain that to my daughter 
because my daughter was worried about 

1101
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:12,740
some things and she,
she was asking me some questions and she

1102
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:17,741
was worried about stuff and I said,
do you know why you're worried about 

1103
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:17,741
these things?
Go.

1104
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:21,560
It's a good thing.
It's because you're smart and you're 

1105
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:21,750
aware of danger and you're aware of the 
variables.

1106
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,240
I go,
you're going to be fun.

1107
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,860
I go,
but I'm like that too.

1108
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:28,010
But I've just figured out how to manage 
it and so I to like kind of explain

1109
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:28,910
it to her.
I'm like,

1110
00:50:28,911 --> 00:50:31,140
you're just a smart little girl and 
you're,

1111
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:32,240
you're aware.
Like,

1112
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:37,241
Hey,
there's a lot of fucking idiots out 

1113
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:37,241
here.
And some of them are on there.

1114
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:38,530
Like she freaks out when she sees people
texting and driving was like,

1115
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,490
dad's.
He's not,

1116
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:44,800
he's not looking at his car.
And kills more people than drunk 

1117
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:44,800
driving.
Now she's right to be,

1118
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,490
you know,
it's just being anxious about that 

1119
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:49,930
instead of something you can't control.
Then the brain starts going,

1120
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:51,380
you know,
she's age is because like,

1121
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:56,381
how do you,
how do you stop people from doing that 

1122
00:50:56,381 --> 00:50:56,381
liquid if they do that,
and what if they hit her car?

1123
00:50:56,381 --> 00:50:57,650
What if they hit somebody else's car and
what happens?

1124
00:50:57,651 --> 00:51:01,730
Then her and I are the same person and 
you know,

1125
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:06,780
and that,
that makes adrenaline which makes 

1126
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,201
dopamine and you know,
it sort of becomes this outflowing 

1127
00:51:08,201 --> 00:51:08,201
prophecy.

1128
00:51:08,201 --> 00:51:09,350
Our brains evolved to make anxiety feel 
good on some level.

1129
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,670
It makes us crazy.
Women that are the moms that she goes to

1130
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:16,730
school with,
her kids go to school with her friends,

1131
00:51:16,731 --> 00:51:19,460
whether they're moms,
they're on fucking xanax too,

1132
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:22,560
so they're on Xanax and they're on 
amphetamines.

1133
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,860
So delete both and you're at the same 
place,

1134
00:51:24,861 --> 00:51:26,960
but they want to stay.
This is the way to do it.

1135
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:32,140
This is the way.
Stay happy to be on Xanax because from 

1136
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,440
being scared and then,
and then and then keeps you guys.

1137
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:45,850
If you can afford time wise and 
financially to go to the appointment to 

1138
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:48,500
get xanax and adderall,
you have no actual problem.

1139
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:49,280
No.
See,

1140
00:51:49,281 --> 00:51:51,530
the thing is they all want to go to 
doctors.

1141
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,470
They go to doctors constantly sensitive 
because you.

1142
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:59,500
You get this idea in your head that 
you're going to find this guy and he's 

1143
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,041
got a good job and you're going to live 
in a nice community and you're going to 

1144
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:03,041
have children and then you're going to 
be happy.

1145
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:04,160
My nightmare.
You realize like,

1146
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:09,190
oh,
well you're just breeding and then you 

1147
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:09,230
know you have to find fulfillment in 
your actual existence.

1148
00:52:09,231 --> 00:52:12,470
Your Day to day here and now.
The moment like this,

1149
00:52:12,471 --> 00:52:13,910
the moment,
like right now,

1150
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:19,010
you have to find fulfillment in that and
it's not going to be in like bling 

1151
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:19,100
blings idea where you get like,
oh,

1152
00:52:19,101 --> 00:52:24,101
I got a boat now,
look up my boat and now I've got to 

1153
00:52:24,101 --> 00:52:24,101
fucking this and I'm going to look at my
new watch.

1154
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:25,070
Doesn't work.
No,

1155
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:27,350
it doesn't work.
And You keep trying to fill that hole up

1156
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:28,460
and it never.
It never gets filled.

1157
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,190
No.
So these women start going to dog,

1158
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:35,230
I've got anxiety and the doctor like 
here take this is like opposable thumbs.

1159
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:40,790
It's been very effective and useful in 
our history.

1160
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:45,380
It's like this is the first time in our 
history that anxiety is not particularly

1161
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:48,590
useful because we have doors and locks 
and you know.

1162
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,850
Um,
but yeah,

1163
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,580
there's an interesting tie here.
Entitlement.

1164
00:52:52,581 --> 00:52:54,770
When I hear about that and look,
I've definitely been like,

1165
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:57,400
I'm doing a show and I have to write a 
script and I'm going to take it.

1166
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,270
I've definitely cheated and cut corners.
That's,

1167
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:02,480
I'm not cheating and cut corners.
I just mean when I'm like,

1168
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,760
I have to finish the script in four 
hours,

1169
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:07,340
I'm going to take a half an adderall.
I've definitely done it,

1170
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:10,310
but I know I have addiction in my dna 
and I know that can get real ugly.

1171
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,320
I've never done adderall.
What does it really?

1172
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,410
Here's my experience.
I'm sure it's different with everybody.

1173
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,590
My experience with adult adderall is 
what I'm,

1174
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,520
cause I,
uh,

1175
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:26,290
not easily distracted.
I don't like when people diagnosed 

1176
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:26,290
themselves.
I have add,

1177
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:26,290
I have OCD.
It's like if you had any

1178
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,870
of those things,
you wouldn't be able to sit on a podcast

1179
00:53:28,871 --> 00:53:31,800
for an hour and we'll,
we'll get to that in a minute,

1180
00:53:31,801 --> 00:53:32,570
but go,
please go.

1181
00:53:32,571 --> 00:53:34,650
I just what it does for me,
and again,

1182
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:39,651
it could be a placebo effect.
So many of these things that we take 

1183
00:53:39,651 --> 00:53:39,651
maybe with the exception of 
amphetamines,

1184
00:53:39,651 --> 00:53:42,630
but certainly antidepressants and stuff 
is taking it,

1185
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,420
is part of why it works.
Just the act of putting it in your mouth

1186
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:48,270
and swallowing it.
I think placebo effect is something like

1187
00:53:48,271 --> 00:53:53,271
58 percent or something.
Correct me on that because I'm probably 

1188
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:53,271
wrong please.
Um,

1189
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,240
but uh,
so for me,

1190
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:59,450
I find if I'm at my computer,
because all these devices are all 

1191
00:53:59,450 --> 00:53:59,730
addictive to the color of the cortisol,
the adrenaline.

1192
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:01,410
So if I've got this device in front of 
me,

1193
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:02,880
I've got my computer and I'm writing,
writing,

1194
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:07,881
writing and this dings and I'm here and 
then I'm an instagram and then there's 

1195
00:54:07,881 --> 00:54:08,620
the link and then all of a sudden I'm 
reading about the apocalypse and I,

1196
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:10,560
my email might be.
Exactly.

1197
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:13,870
And then I'm in a fucking email thing 
with it's totally a net.

1198
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:15,450
Haha.
Like love you too.

1199
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:16,590
See you soon.
See you soon.

1200
00:54:16,591 --> 00:54:18,540
And then I just can't end of an 
exchange.

1201
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,900
And basically when I've taken adderall 
in the past I just do one thing with 

1202
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:27,600
more enthusiasm and it is less appealing
to me to go do other things.

1203
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,620
The other day I put my phone down to 
workout.

1204
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:31,310
I worked out for an hour and a half.
I got done.

1205
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:36,311
I had 37 texts to too many,
but they were probably all from me and 

1206
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:38,590
Krista.
Leah.

1207
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:43,780
There is one thing that we can't talk 
too much about this,

1208
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,320
but one thread you realize that we also 
have our own thread without you.

1209
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:50,390
When we worry we're bothering you too,
Max.

1210
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:56,300
Even all of our exchanges all day,
like you'll respond,

1211
00:54:56,301 --> 00:54:57,890
but then you won't respond for like two 
days.

1212
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:02,010
Oh he's too busy.
As a family we can't.

1213
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:06,800
Like if his wife sees that he has 40 
mixed tax mistakes at midnight,

1214
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:09,720
like this is bad for his daughter asks 
me sometimes.

1215
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,600
Sometimes we're watching TV and she's 
like,

1216
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:12,850
who's texting you?
I'm like,

1217
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:13,970
Oh fuck,
I'm a comedian,

1218
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:16,660
but it's like,
why did Whitney just said you 40 tax?

1219
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:18,500
Okay,
well she also sent into two other guys.

1220
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:20,320
It's not.
She's ruining everyone's relationship.

1221
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:21,890
A jealousy issue,
but it is a.

1222
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,110
it's like we're,
we're a family.

1223
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,420
This is wrong.
She's not wrong.

1224
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,310
So there's something interesting about 
sort of being on your phone with kids is

1225
00:55:30,311 --> 00:55:33,910
the new being drunk on your phone 
because kids look at you and they think,

1226
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,040
oh,
that device is more important than me.

1227
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:41,520
I must be a real piece of shit if daddy 
would rather look at that or mommy or 

1228
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:41,520
whatever.
Yeah.

1229
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,450
There's an interesting that like cell 
phone uses the new alcoholism.

1230
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:48,630
I,
my little kid got ahold of snapchat 

1231
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,731
recently.
She's been doing these snapchat videos 

1232
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:52,960
are fucking hilarious.
She's my six year old is hilarious.

1233
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,620
She doesn't.
She uses the filter so you don't.

1234
00:55:55,630 --> 00:56:00,630
You don't see it's her,
but she was Abraham Lincoln yesterday 

1235
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,730
and then she became an evil snowball 
that she's a little fuck.

1236
00:56:01,731 --> 00:56:03,630
Do you care?
But she doesn't post that.

1237
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:04,320
No,
no,

1238
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,180
no.
She just leaves him on my phone.

1239
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,310
Then I sometimes I put them up on 
instagram because they're so ridiculous.

1240
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:14,370
Just yesterday I started doing it,
but I mean that's a slippery slope 

1241
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,590
because they get addicted to those,
those little things and it all makes,

1242
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,550
you know,
adrenaline.

1243
00:56:18,551 --> 00:56:23,551
So going back to what you're saying,
I don't think you're cheating because 

1244
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,040
you take a half an adderall to work on

1245
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:29,040
a script.
It's no different than me drinking 

1246
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,150
coffee or smoking pot.
I smoked a lot of pot.

1247
00:56:29,151 --> 00:56:29,980
Yeah.
So if I,

1248
00:56:29,981 --> 00:56:31,480
if I smoke pot and.
Right.

1249
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:32,590
Did I cheat too?
Right?

1250
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,420
I mean,
I don't know.

1251
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,940
I think it's just knowing.
I mean you said this or like knowing who

1252
00:56:36,941 --> 00:56:39,910
you are and what your limitations are 
and what actually works for you and what

1253
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:41,110
starts being,
you know,

1254
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:45,250
diminished showed diminishing returns.
Like I know if I smoke pot every night,

1255
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,100
it's not going to be as effective for me
and I'm going to be groggy.

1256
00:56:48,101 --> 00:56:48,910
I like,
I just,

1257
00:56:48,911 --> 00:56:51,130
I have some restraint about it and some 
discipline.

1258
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,880
Not on New Year's eve that was 
different.

1259
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:55,480
She sent me a picture for New Year's 
Eve.

1260
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:59,280
She looks,
you look like someone sprayed you with a

1261
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,270
mist of sweat.
Literally.

1262
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:06,600
I,
so I had a and I'll tell you about this 

1263
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,940
next time I come on because I am writing
about it in a book and I and I,

1264
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:13,020
it's a long story but I had a surgery 
and I don't do well on painkillers by 

1265
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,000
some miracle,
uh,

1266
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:19,170
because my genetically,
my family loves me killers but I for 

1267
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,320
some reason they make me really nauseous
so,

1268
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:25,890
and I was smoking weed instead,
but I was also like,

1269
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,540
I don't know what your take on this,
but my lungs were.

1270
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,250
I was like getting out of breath and I 
was like,

1271
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:31,950
let me just do these edible things.
Yeah.

1272
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,750
Because I was just like,
I was in like a spin class or something,

1273
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:39,751
which sometimes I do just for like anger
management and you fucking cracking your

1274
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:48,700
enamel.
Just slamming my vagina being just 

1275
00:57:51,671 --> 00:57:53,830
totally like,
it's really hard on the,

1276
00:57:53,831 --> 00:57:56,380
on the lady bits that spinning.
I can't do it too much.

1277
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,270
It's rough.
Slam it back.

1278
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,510
It's a hard seat and you're slamming and
tapping it back.

1279
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:06,511
But there is this one class that I 
really liked and I liked the instructor 

1280
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:07,960
and I just kind of cry and release anger
and stuff and it's painful and I'm.

1281
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,660
Yeah.
What's your sweater?

1282
00:58:09,661 --> 00:58:11,170
You look,
I can get away with a cry here.

1283
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,930
Usually it's like it's yes.
Because there's something about,

1284
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:16,120
for me when I feel a certain amount of 
emotional pain,

1285
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:21,121
it just like opens up some kind of well 
of sadness that if it didn't,

1286
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:26,400
if I didn't cry it out,
it's going to come out as anger another 

1287
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,611
time.
So I'd rather just release it in a 

1288
00:58:29,611 --> 00:58:29,611
healthy private way and pay $38 in 
class.

1289
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,030
It's $30,
bucks a class.

1290
00:58:31,031 --> 00:58:36,031
But yeah,
I think soul cycle is like 38 bucks if 

1291
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:36,031
you do it one at a time.
If you do it,

1292
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:37,780
I do it in a package so it's less.
That seems super expensive.

1293
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:38,710
It is,
it is.

1294
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:42,790
It's a bunch of like rich publicists a 
pretending that a problem.

1295
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,980
I was in aspen and it was during the 
winter and they opened up the school.

1296
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,800
I was at the,
uh,

1297
00:58:50,801 --> 00:58:51,700
the,
uh,

1298
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:54,610
I'm not throckmorton theatre that the.
Yeah,

1299
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:59,630
that's where I stayed.
I know they have a festival there again 

1300
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,560
now.
Yeah,

1301
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:05,950
it was me and Neilan and Margaret.
I think this is the first year.

1302
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,100
It was,
what's the theme?

1303
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:12,190
Nights I go,
I was sick the entire time.

1304
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:15,130
Hard with that at oxygen up there.
It's like 8,000

1305
00:59:15,131 --> 00:59:17,530
feet above sea level.
So in town I can't,

1306
00:59:17,531 --> 00:59:18,850
it can't be healthy.
Well,

1307
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:20,770
I think it is eventually,
but not,

1308
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,250
not initially,

1309
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,410
but uh,
what was my point?

1310
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:30,250
You were in Aspen and we span and it 
doesn't,

1311
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,440
I didn't spend shape I've ever been in 
was when I was in aspen for like a week 

1312
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:36,440
and I worked out everyday.
Oh yeah,

1313
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:41,291
for sure.
Well that's why fighters go up to big 

1314
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:41,291
bear and train.
Right.

1315
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:43,010
And like a steamboat springs maybe or 
anywhere.

1316
00:59:43,011 --> 00:59:45,680
It's above in Colorado.
They all do a denver.

1317
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:48,140
There's a team elevate that competes up 
there.

1318
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,840
But um,
is it twice as much like you,

1319
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,320
like if you work out 20 minutes,
does that equal the 40 minutes?

1320
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,040
Basically tools.
Honestly,

1321
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:57,590
the way they think you're supposed to do
it now,

1322
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:02,620
they think you're supposed to actually 
train at sea level and then sleep 

1323
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:08,240
altitude,
so if you could live at the base of big 

1324
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,620
bear and then drive up to big bear to 
get your workouts in and then drive down

1325
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:12,080
to live and sleep because the idea is.

1326
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:12,770
Or The opposite.
Yeah,

1327
01:00:12,771 --> 01:00:17,771
drive down and get your workouts and 
drive back up to live in because they 

1328
01:00:17,771 --> 01:00:21,370
think that you get more workout,
put in sea level and then when you're 

1329
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:22,350
not going to tire.
Exactly.

1330
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:27,230
But then your body recovers and you 
acclimate to having a higher threshold.

1331
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,480
You develop more red blood cells the 
whole deal.

1332
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:34,870
But anyway,
they had a spin classes up there soul 

1333
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:36,200
cycle and they only opened it up for 
like a month.

1334
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:37,150
Like they,
they,

1335
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:41,390
they just rented a place for a month for
soul cycle during peak ski season.

1336
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,000
Oh,
like a,

1337
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,420
like a,
like a,

1338
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,770
what is it called?
The historic just opens for a month,

1339
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:50,800
like a pop up.
Like you know how they do those 

1340
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:50,800
halloween stores when a place closes 
down?

1341
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:50,800
Yes.
Yeah,

1342
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,450
yeah.
Or like a Christmas tree,

1343
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,740
they just brought in a bunch of fucking 
cycles and set up a social.

1344
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:59,750
I mean it might've been doing it to like
test the waters whether or not because 

1345
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:00,170
aspen is so much fucking money.
It's so crazy.

1346
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:02,600
Every other car has a range rover and 
shocked.

1347
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:07,660
It's really just rich alcoholics losers.
People in minks drinking makers to pen.

1348
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:14,990
Yeah.
I was shocked because my flight got 

1349
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:14,990
canceled and I had to stay for the day.
If I was a high end hooker,

1350
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:18,440
that's where I went.
I am a pop up.

1351
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:20,120
There it is.
Let's use spin an 8,000

1352
01:01:20,121 --> 01:01:21,080
feet.
Knows that what it is.

1353
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,390
They call it a pop up.
That's what it was.

1354
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:23,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

1355
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:23,710
So,
um,

1356
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:28,780
I don't know your take on spinning.
My chiropractor says he is going to 

1357
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,650
retire on the money that he gets from a 
spinning injuries.

1358
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:35,600
He's literally like people doing yoga 
and spinning a how I pay my bills.

1359
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:40,640
Well a lot of people do it not like 
improperly and mess up their shoulders 

1360
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,440
real bad and their lower backs doing all
those downward dog.

1361
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,560
If you mess up your shoulders from Yoga,
jump off a fucking building.

1362
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:48,430
Seriously you pussy.
That's what takes you out.

1363
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:53,830
How'd you break a snow dog?
Doing Yoga got daily snowboarding.

1364
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,550
Makes Sense.
No,

1365
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,230
it's more like people want to do yoga 
for exercise,

1366
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:03,500
like these type A.
People want yoga to burn 9,000

1367
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:08,501
calories and get them like a huge ass,
but that's not really what yoga is 

1368
01:02:08,501 --> 01:02:10,850
designed to do.
So there's all these new yoga classes 

1369
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:10,970
that are like acro yoga,
hot intense,

1370
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:14,150
and you're too loose and you're trying 
to do things that well.

1371
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:17,000
There's no like pushups in weird 
positions.

1372
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:19,890
We were on one shoulder and yeah,
I don't do that kind of deal that you're

1373
01:02:19,891 --> 01:02:24,891
doing it perfectly.
You're going to injure yourself unless 

1374
01:02:24,891 --> 01:02:24,891
you have a one on one instructor.
You do be crumbs.

1375
01:02:24,891 --> 01:02:26,910
Hot Yoga,
stretching,

1376
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:30,440
flexibility.
My spine particular spine strengthening.

1377
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:33,910
You don't go to yoga to get glutes.
No.

1378
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,830
You do it too.
Yeah.

1379
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:38,820
I think you got to balance even that.
I do,

1380
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,180
I do.
Yeah.

1381
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:45,780
I think you gotta be real careful with 
those common atory type movements.

1382
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:50,860
Yeah,
so for me soul site or like spinning is 

1383
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:51,570
really just to like get out anger and 
like push myself.

1384
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:56,630
Even crossfit,
I think crossfit can be very dangerous 

1385
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:59,481
because there's a lot of people that do 
crossfit and they don't really have 

1386
01:02:59,481 --> 01:03:00,410
perfect technique and they do it to 
failure and you know,

1387
01:03:00,411 --> 01:03:05,411
you're,
you're doing these incredibly high 

1388
01:03:05,411 --> 01:03:06,180
repetitions of power moves,
which Steve Maxwell,

1389
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:08,490
who's a real world famous strength and 
conditioning coach,

1390
01:03:08,491 --> 01:03:09,540
he's like,
that's,

1391
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,360
he's power moves like cleans and 
presses.

1392
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:17,450
You're supposed to do low repetition for
them that is supposed to generate 

1393
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:19,200
extremes for even lower.
Pavel Tatsu,

1394
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,440
Ilene,
who's the,

1395
01:03:20,441 --> 01:03:25,441
uh,
the godfather of kettlebells and 

1396
01:03:25,441 --> 01:03:25,441
America,
we brought them over from Russia.

1397
01:03:25,441 --> 01:03:26,790
He believes you shouldn't do anything 
more than five repetitions.

1398
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:29,280
And what you do is this,
is this like,

1399
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:31,890
because you know,
crossfit attracts such a type,

1400
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,360
a overachiever type of person that the,
you know,

1401
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:41,370
a desire for overachieving supersedes 
the logic of what actually is effective.

1402
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:46,910
Well,
there's a philosophy behind it and I 

1403
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:46,910
think that philosophy can be effective 
for some people.

1404
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:50,931
And I'm very hypocritical if I say don't
do something that causes injuries 

1405
01:03:50,931 --> 01:03:53,640
because I've had a ton of surgeries for 
martial arts and injuries from Jujitsu.

1406
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:57,620
Or was it like a collision injury or was
it just over time?

1407
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:02,690
Over time.
Injuries from knees getting yanked and 

1408
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:05,030
twisted shoulders getting popped out of 
socket.

1409
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:07,320
Get it from working out.
Well,

1410
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:12,321
I got it from sparring.
Most of them I just feel like it's 

1411
01:04:12,691 --> 01:04:13,500
crazy.
Like,

1412
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,400
I mean,
not crazy.

1413
01:04:14,401 --> 01:04:15,360
I don't know.
I'm not an athlete,

1414
01:04:15,361 --> 01:04:19,710
but like to get injured while you're 
practicing while you're in the thing,

1415
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:22,020
you know,
you can't necessarily control that.

1416
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:27,050
Well,
crossfit competitions in particularly 

1417
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:27,050
scary to me because there was one video 
of this guy who was a,

1418
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:31,870
uh,
he owned a crossfit gym and he was 

1419
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:33,771
involved in a competition and he was 
doing these clean presses and his body 

1420
01:04:33,771 --> 01:04:37,221
literally gave out and he dropped the 
weight on the back of his neck and was 

1421
01:04:37,221 --> 01:04:40,701
paralyzed from the rest of his life.
And there's a video of it and it's 

1422
01:04:40,701 --> 01:04:42,480
horrific to watch.
Someone sent me one where someone's up.

1423
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,060
What's your anal sphincter?
Came out.

1424
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:47,340
I saw that one,
he was like,

1425
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:51,450
lifting weights is your hobby is they're
not.

1426
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:57,410
Will he set some goals and he really 
wanted to achieve it and that goes to 

1427
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:00,981
blows asshole out like an old song.
Come back from that stitches,

1428
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,890
painkillers time.
Probably steroids.

1429
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,590
He's allowed to take adderall.
River sand our judgment or.

1430
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:13,730
Yeah,
he should take everything whenever they 

1431
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:13,730
decide to take xanax.
I mean there are countries,

1432
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:14,400
so over medicated.
It's terrifying.

1433
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:15,600
It is terrifying.
Terrifying.

1434
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:16,550
It's Tara.
It's.

1435
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:18,040
Well you really see

1436
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:23,040
it,
like I said in these housewives 

1437
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,040
communities because like,
or,

1438
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,040
or,
you know,

1439
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,040
sleepy.
What do they call them?

1440
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:27,901
Bedroom communities.
Where I go is where white people go to 

1441
01:05:27,901 --> 01:05:29,580
breed and that's where I live.
These people out in the rain.

1442
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,860
They raised their kids out there and 
they,

1443
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:36,580
there's a lot of these people that just 
become medicated.

1444
01:05:36,581 --> 01:05:37,590
Men and women.
It's not.

1445
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:40,690
I mean I talked to the women more than I
talked to the men,

1446
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,360
but uh,
I know a lot of men that are medicated.

1447
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:45,610
They're on adderall and shit.
The late great.

1448
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:48,040
Robert Schimmel,
who's a great line,

1449
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:51,160
I love that guy.
He accidentally took an adderall once,

1450
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,610
told me about it.
He told me,

1451
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:57,280
um,
I forget whose it was,

1452
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:02,370
but he,
he grabbed a pill and he thought he had 

1453
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:02,370
a heart condition.
Yeah,

1454
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:04,050
before the cancer.
Yeah,

1455
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:09,060
he had,
he had a bunch of different issues and 

1456
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,951
cancer and,
and I forget what the medication he 

1457
01:06:10,951 --> 01:06:13,771
thought it was,
but he realized after taking it wasn't 

1458
01:06:13,771 --> 01:06:13,771
his and then it was an adderall and he's
like,

1459
01:06:13,771 --> 01:06:13,960
oh fuck.

1460
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,180
So I called his doctor up and he told 
us,

1461
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,110
Dr.
Hey man,

1462
01:06:17,111 --> 01:06:18,730
I fucked up.
I thought it was this,

1463
01:06:18,731 --> 01:06:20,110
but it's adderall,
like what?

1464
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:22,030
What do I do?
And the doctor said,

1465
01:06:22,031 --> 01:06:24,100
you're going to be fine because you're 
going to be fun.

1466
01:06:24,101 --> 01:06:25,010
It's going to take about,
you know,

1467
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:30,030
x amount of hours to wear off,
but don't worry with that dose and your 

1468
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:30,550
body and your body weight,
you're going to be fine.

1469
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:31,930
So don't worry about it.
And he said,

1470
01:06:31,931 --> 01:06:36,931
I went over all my notes,
said I got a to just start organizing 

1471
01:06:36,931 --> 01:06:38,350
all of my comedy notes.
And he goes,

1472
01:06:38,351 --> 01:06:41,110
I got so much work done.
It's unbelievable how perfectly,

1473
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:44,140
but it starts to backfire,
so I remember when I was like,

1474
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:49,170
this is working,
I kept doing it and then the aftermath 

1475
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:49,810
was like I couldn't fall asleep that 
night and then I was even more tired the

1476
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:50,920
next day,
which meant I needed to take more.

1477
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,470
It just becomes an addiction and it 
stops being that effective.

1478
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:58,471
If you overuse it.
Tait Fletcher put something on his 

1479
01:06:58,471 --> 01:07:01,021
instagram today about the strongest cup 
of coffee in the world and it's from 

1480
01:07:01,021 --> 01:07:02,770
Australia.
They made this cup of coffee that you're

1481
01:07:02,771 --> 01:07:07,771
supposed to sip over the course of three
to four hours and it is half alisal a 

1482
01:07:08,411 --> 01:07:10,270
lethal dose.
Yeah,

1483
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:12,100
like four Loko or.
Yeah,

1484
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:17,550
for local though was like I have.
So I've taken out of this the strongest 

1485
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:21,691
coffee look at it says they're the 
world's strongest cup of coffee's 

1486
01:07:21,691 --> 01:07:25,261
outrageously caffeinated.
It has contains 80 times the amount of 

1487
01:07:25,451 --> 01:07:30,190
caffeine in the single cup.
It's called the ass kicker coffee.

1488
01:07:30,191 --> 01:07:33,610
It's sold at the vicious coffee,
the vicious cafe in Australia.

1489
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:38,290
So what's in it?
It has four shots of espresso,

1490
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:42,580
ate ice cubes of cold brew and a half a 
cup of 10 day old cold brew.

1491
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,910
That adds up to half the amount of 
caffeine needed for lethal dose.

1492
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:50,380
Steve Bennington created the drink for a
nurse completing a night shift.

1493
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:54,460
A lot.
My nurse to be so tired it's meant to be

1494
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:59,461
sipped over three to four hours and it 
took the nurse two days to finish the 

1495
01:07:59,461 --> 01:08:03,901
drink.
She stayed up for three days after she 

1496
01:08:03,901 --> 01:08:03,901
drank it.

1497
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:10,790
She was seeing rabbits are a fucking 
running around in pajamas at her house 

1498
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:12,060
and rising.
Everyone,

1499
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:14,710
I don't know.
I mean look,

1500
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:16,160
it's my goal

1501
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,730
because I.
by the time I was like 28 or 20,

1502
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:24,760
well maybe it was.
I noticed him when I was 31 because I 

1503
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,551
froze my eggs when I was 31 and this is 
maybe when I noticed it that at 31 I was

1504
01:08:27,891 --> 01:08:32,891
on five medications while you froze your
eggs because when I froze my eggs,

1505
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:35,390
they put you on a thyroid medication for
some reason.

1506
01:08:35,391 --> 01:08:37,610
I don't know why,
and I was on,

1507
01:08:37,611 --> 01:08:41,120
I think to antidepressants,
a birth control of course,

1508
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:46,121
which makes me very crazy.
They had given me adderall for when I 

1509
01:08:46,121 --> 01:08:46,640
needed it.
Um,

1510
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,550
I had Lunesta to sleep and I just was 
like,

1511
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:55,180
this is,
I have more medications than someone in 

1512
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:55,180
a nursing home.
Like this is crazy.

1513
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:59,090
And for thousands of years we've 
survived without all of these bills,

1514
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:01,640
like this can't be right.
And I just noticed this and I don't know

1515
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:02,870
if it's what I do for a living,
you know,

1516
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,450
but just this dismissive instead of,
hey,

1517
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:07,580
learned to meditate or whatever,
someone was like,

1518
01:09:07,581 --> 01:09:08,480
here's a sleeping pill.

1519
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:13,690
And I found myself like restless,
irritable and discontent and not 

1520
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:15,050
actually getting quality sleep.
And I'm on the antidote.

1521
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:17,180
I don't even know.
I felt like a shell of a person,

1522
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:22,210
you know.
And so that's when I sort of started 

1523
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:22,490
looking into all these medicaid and then
of course I was on coffee and you know,

1524
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,670
all this other stuff.
So my body chemistry was just bananas.

1525
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:28,280
And I think that a lot of people,
um,

1526
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:33,370
you know,
I personally would like to sort of get 

1527
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:33,370
to the root of it or get ahead of my 
pain.

1528
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:37,211
So I'm not that housewife in 20 years 
who's just taken xanax because I've got 

1529
01:09:37,211 --> 01:09:40,430
pain or can't deal with discomfort or 
anxiety like an adult.

1530
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:42,500
Do you think you have pickled eggs?
Eggs?

1531
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:49,090
My eggs are by the beach and Redondo,
they are doing just fine.

1532
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,200
They're like,
yeah,

1533
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:51,990
they're frozen somewhere.

1534
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:53,630
A locker.
You go visit them.

1535
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:55,010
I don't.
I'm a dead beat mom.

1536
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,850
I'm a terrible mother.
I never go see them.

1537
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:00,410
I wouldn't trust that they were 
organized.

1538
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:05,020
I don't think that is the main nightmare
that I have.

1539
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,610
You are crazy.
My kids Chinese,

1540
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:12,140
why love for that to happen actually.
But uh,

1541
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:12,790
yeah,
I,

1542
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:15,950
I worry about that constantly.
I mean with the Oscar mix up last night.

1543
01:10:15,951 --> 01:10:18,840
I mean I heard about that.
I mean,

1544
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:21,050
what did they mix up my eggs with?
What happened?

1545
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:24,410
They said someone one and then see it 
basically born baby.

1546
01:10:24,411 --> 01:10:26,390
They gave him an envelope,
bless his heart.

1547
01:10:26,391 --> 01:10:28,310
I can't.
And I'm so hard not read anymore.

1548
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:28,790
No,
it's.

1549
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:33,820
They gave him the wrong envelope.
Has done nothing except be a classy 

1550
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:37,901
legend.
She was just like the Steve Harvey 

1551
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:37,901
thing.
Yes,

1552
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:37,901
exactly.
Same thing.

1553
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:38,770
All the memes are,
are,

1554
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:43,130
uh,
the comparing them basically like Warren

1555
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:45,860
Beatty's and new Steve Harvey or Warren 
Beatty's of brilliant legend.

1556
01:10:45,861 --> 01:10:48,560
And Steve Harvey is a silly talk show 
hosts.

1557
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,670
Um,
but,

1558
01:10:49,671 --> 01:10:50,330
uh,
but yeah,

1559
01:10:50,331 --> 01:10:53,960
he,
he got the envelope for best actress and

1560
01:10:53,961 --> 01:10:56,680
he's so,
and he just saw Lala Land and said best,

1561
01:10:56,681 --> 01:11:01,681
uh,
and the entire cast of La la land went 

1562
01:11:01,681 --> 01:11:01,910
up on stage and then they had to go,
oh,

1563
01:11:01,911 --> 01:11:06,911
actually it's moonlight.
And then when the producers of La La 

1564
01:11:06,911 --> 01:11:06,911
land was a total class act,
[inaudible] and gentlemen,

1565
01:11:06,911 --> 01:11:08,030
and was like,
moonlight won.

1566
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,460
And then moonlight had to come up.
It was mad.

1567
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,400
It was like the super bowl stress level.
I fucking hate those

1568
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,110
contests.
I really do.

1569
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,280
I don't have a dog in the game.
Is it?

1570
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:21,420
What's the expression dog in the fight?
I don't have a dog in the fight,

1571
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,460
but I,
I,

1572
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:26,160
I hate those.
I hate award shows for art.

1573
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,900
They seemed so pretentious.

1574
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:29,630
Not already one.
You have,

1575
01:11:29,631 --> 01:11:31,490
you bought one,
you have millions of dollars.

1576
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,380
Movie Stars.
What is the.

1577
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,550
Well,
I think for me,

1578
01:11:34,551 --> 01:11:36,560
I mean especially with the political 
climate,

1579
01:11:36,561 --> 01:11:38,000
when people go and make political 
speeches,

1580
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:38,990
it's like,
okay,

1581
01:11:38,991 --> 01:11:41,930
how much did you donate this year?
Like what are you really do?

1582
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:42,890
Like,
you know,

1583
01:11:42,891 --> 01:11:45,530
just making all these speeches and 
talking the talk.

1584
01:11:45,531 --> 01:11:47,830
I hope everyone is also walking the walk
and you know,

1585
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:50,180
authentic that way.
I don't know,

1586
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:50,700
it's just,
it's,

1587
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:55,750
it's so.
I mean I think there's something 

1588
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,790
anesthetic about it for people.
I think there's.

1589
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:02,800
Look at the silly monkey,
like the diversion of dresses and 

1590
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:02,990
necklaces and makeup and actresses,
you know,

1591
01:12:02,991 --> 01:12:07,991
I think humans,
we have probably an inherent need for 

1592
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:09,590
that sort of diversion,
that sort of vapid.

1593
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:12,500
Let's talk about dresses instead of 
what's really going on.

1594
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:15,530
And there's always a ribbon that you're 
supposed to wear.

1595
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:20,580
Yup.
What was the ribbon they had to wear 

1596
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:20,750
last night?
There was a blue ribbon for Eclu.

1597
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Oh,
I thought it was for the iceberg that 

1598
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:26,000
was breaking off.
I was like,

1599
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,950
maybe they're too worried about that 
giant iceberg the size of Manhattan 

1600
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:30,050
that's about to fucking die now.
It's just,

1601
01:12:30,051 --> 01:12:30,980
it's just,
there's so many,

1602
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:32,840
you know,
and I just get frustrated sometimes.

1603
01:12:32,841 --> 01:12:33,580
I mean,
your,

1604
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:37,490
your listeners are not the ones because 
your listeners seem to all be seekers,

1605
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,550
like who the fuck knows?
That's like saying all girls or all boys

1606
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,160
know.
My listeners are a bunch of knuckleheads

1607
01:12:43,161 --> 01:12:46,730
out there that listens to you is smart I
think,

1608
01:12:46,731 --> 01:12:48,890
or at least definitely not true.
Aspires to be.

1609
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,980
There's a guy right now,
you guys,

1610
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:01,680
where's Kendall Jones?
Who My thongs,

1611
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:05,240
Blah should be lion hunting porn.
You,

1612
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,970
you shoot environment.
You fuck right on top of this.

1613
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:12,220
I feel like that would do well to 
someone buried.

1614
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,240
Desensitized.
Um,

1615
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:15,470
I mean that's what it's coming to you,

1616
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:17,710
I guess these days.
Hashtag read it.

1617
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:19,390
Um,
but yeah,

1618
01:13:19,391 --> 01:13:24,391
I'm sure it's humans have a need to just
sort of disassociate with pictures of 

1619
01:13:25,481 --> 01:13:26,020
dresses.

1620
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:28,480
Yeah,
I think there's definitely some of that.

1621
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:34,080
There's definitely the pageantry people 
love when people dress up in all their 

1622
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:34,570
best and they walked through watching 
people.

1623
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,230
Oh yeah.
Look,

1624
01:13:36,231 --> 01:13:37,800
it's all together.
Look at it.

1625
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:38,690
Look,
oh,

1626
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:41,710
she's not even happy for it.
It's like no matter what she does,

1627
01:13:41,711 --> 01:13:43,480
you're going to project to your shed 
onto this,

1628
01:13:43,481 --> 01:13:46,870
but you know what I do?
I do secretly not so secretly enjoy.

1629
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:51,550
I do enjoy watching people as they get 
older who are clearly fucking crazy.

1630
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,680
Keep it together.
Less and less.

1631
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:57,410
Nicole Kidman was clapping like the 
grinch last night.

1632
01:13:57,670 --> 01:13:59,170
Yes.
She was clapping.

1633
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:02,860
I mean,
I don't know what that is.

1634
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:06,490
I don't clap a lot because we're comics.
We don't go to shows.

1635
01:14:06,491 --> 01:14:08,350
I don't even clap.
Clap.

1636
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:13,440
Well,
you have to clap if you have a daughter 

1637
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,820
in play constantly.
You all just filming the whole time?

1638
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:17,720
No,
I club my wife films.

1639
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:18,780
Clap.
Yeah.

1640
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,310
I don't like.
I'm not a good clapper either.

1641
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:23,290
I do it after sac.
Clap when you.

1642
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,760
Good job.
Yay.

1643
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:26,540
I found it out.
Look at it.

1644
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:27,750
No.
Wait.

1645
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,570
Look at this.

1646
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:32,110
She also has.
She's comically Willoway.

1647
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,240
I mean she does.
Her nails went.

1648
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:37,840
I don't know.
There's something crazy.

1649
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:40,610
Carpal tunnel from holding your hands 
way back.

1650
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,530
She's doing too much.
Be Chrome.

1651
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,770
That's not good for your joints.
I am.

1652
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:47,080
I do have.
I am hyper mobile.

1653
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,810
Do you know about hypermobility?
This is a thing.

1654
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:55,380
So it's a lot of western European trash 
genetics that we use our joints instead 

1655
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:59,170
of our muscles when we move and walk and
do things.

1656
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:01,900
And I got this thing called Costco.
Chondritis.

1657
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,960
I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
It's basically when your cartilage and 

1658
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,100
flames and it was in my chest,
I can be like,

1659
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:12,070
it's like a relative of plural cbds and 
it's.

1660
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,900
I did have pneumonia and didn't treat 
it,

1661
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:15,810
but I had so much stress in my back that
my,

1662
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:18,250
uh,
the cartilage or my ribs started rubbing

1663
01:15:18,251 --> 01:15:19,330
I guess against each other.

1664
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,550
And I went to this rheumatologist who is
like,

1665
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:22,840
oh,
you're a hyper mobile,

1666
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,670
which means you don't walk with your 
muscles,

1667
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:29,671
you walk with your joints.
That's where all of the impact goes and 

1668
01:15:29,671 --> 01:15:32,611
you need to relearn how to walk.
So you need to cushion yourself with 

1669
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,240
your muscles.
Like you're not using your muscles.

1670
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:34,900
Basic.
Yeah,

1671
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:39,901
you're basically.
I walked just like a Zombie.

1672
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,580
I walked like a monster.
I'm like,

1673
01:15:42,581 --> 01:15:45,070
what that mean in the beginning of the 
thriller video,

1674
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:49,080
just like everything's all wonky and I 
was like,

1675
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:54,270
um,
so that's where all and that's how he's 

1676
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:56,550
like,
that's why people when they're 55 have 

1677
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:58,441
non collision injuries.
That's why you hear about people who 

1678
01:15:58,441 --> 01:15:58,441
like sneeze and throw them back out.
It's just,

1679
01:15:58,441 --> 01:15:59,350
there's so much impact over so much 
amount of time.

1680
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:04,740
I had to go to a [inaudible] instructor 
who specializes in this and I was just 

1681
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:08,491
like,
had to hold a rubber band and like walk 

1682
01:16:08,491 --> 01:16:08,491
like it was so boring that I just 
stopped going.

1683
01:16:08,491 --> 01:16:13,250
This podcast is going to be really fun 
to listen to the DM people's 

1684
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:13,250
interpretations when they remember 
everything poorly.

1685
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:18,350
Kendall Jenner killed a lion and she 
can't walk right into death.

1686
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,080
I'll do.
She's definitely on adderall.

1687
01:16:20,081 --> 01:16:22,200
I remember.
I would like to hear the recap,

1688
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:22,770
uh,
of,

1689
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:27,790
of this bike us something about the 
botox in her face and reached way to her

1690
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:32,610
fingertips and she couldn't keep him.
He was shitting out so much mct oil that

1691
01:16:32,611 --> 01:16:34,740
she actually couldn't even clap.
She,

1692
01:16:34,741 --> 01:16:36,870
there is something going on with him 
with Nicole Kidman's,

1693
01:16:36,871 --> 01:16:41,871
phase two.
She's definitely shooting some stuff in 

1694
01:16:41,871 --> 01:16:43,821
her face.
She's got some weird sort of frozen 

1695
01:16:43,821 --> 01:16:43,821
appearance thing going on.
It's

1696
01:16:43,821 --> 01:16:48,500
weird to me because people accused me of
having worked in and do you see my in my

1697
01:16:48,501 --> 01:16:51,860
forehead I have wrinkles.
So that's sort of how,

1698
01:16:51,861 --> 01:16:56,861
you know,
if someone has wrinkles there that they 

1699
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:57,290
haven't had botox.
But when people say I had worked on,

1700
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,360
I just,
I just tried to take it as a compliment,

1701
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:03,080
but will they just assume everybody gets
work done?

1702
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:08,110
That's just an assumption.
Here's what a doctor said to me because 

1703
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:09,240
I said to a doctor,
I had really bad under eye bags,

1704
01:17:09,241 --> 01:17:11,060
you know,
I was doing a TV show like bad,

1705
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:13,340
like they looked like I look like Steve 
Buscemi.

1706
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:14,660
It was not because they just weren't 
sleeping.

1707
01:17:14,661 --> 01:17:16,550
I wasn't sleeping and I was not eating 
well.

1708
01:17:16,551 --> 01:17:18,950
I wasn't hydrated and as too much salt.
And genetically,

1709
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:22,190
again,
my genetics are a disaster and my mom,

1710
01:17:22,191 --> 01:17:23,570
everybody has it.
It's fat.

1711
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,150
I mean it's not really something.
Ice Sleep,

1712
01:17:26,151 --> 01:17:28,220
nothing helped.
And so,

1713
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:33,310
uh,
I went to a bunch of doctors and their 

1714
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:33,310
solution is,
they were like,

1715
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:34,070
well,
we can put filler.

1716
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,820
They call that one guy called it a 
pillar,

1717
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:41,360
like we build a pillar to fill it in.
And I was like,

1718
01:17:41,361 --> 01:17:42,140
no,
I'm a comedian.

1719
01:17:42,141 --> 01:17:44,510
I can't just get a new face.
Like I,

1720
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:49,850
I can't do the Joan rivers thing.
Like it's just not the carrot top or 

1721
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:51,110
whatever.
And uh,

1722
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:53,070
and basically,
uh,

1723
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:54,530
he explained to me,
I was like,

1724
01:17:54,531 --> 01:17:56,810
I can't have bad where I can't,
like this is not good.

1725
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:01,840
Work is so obvious.
And he said something interesting what 

1726
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:01,840
you just said.
He was like,

1727
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:01,840
you only notice the bad work.
He was like,

1728
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:04,970
everybody gets it done,
but the good but the good work you don't

1729
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:06,970
notice.
Well,

1730
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:08,870
I mean that's sort of what he had 
totally.

1731
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:10,550
Which he was probably just manipulating 
me,

1732
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:14,030
but I didn't end up doing it.
But he puts it in there.

1733
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:19,240
But this is like literally,
I know I'm talking like a rapist trying 

1734
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:24,791
to control someone.
But in he explained to me because I was 

1735
01:18:24,791 --> 01:18:27,491
like,
everybody just kind of looks like 

1736
01:18:27,491 --> 01:18:27,491
swollen.
It's just been punched in the cheek,

1737
01:18:27,491 --> 01:18:28,820
but that's what happens when you get 
filler.

1738
01:18:28,821 --> 01:18:31,160
Everything.
You have to build everything out.

1739
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:33,050
It's becomes a,
if you do this,

1740
01:18:33,051 --> 01:18:35,300
you got to do this because you got to,
you know.

1741
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:37,490
So once you start,
there's no going back.

1742
01:18:37,491 --> 01:18:39,750
And I'm actually noticing it in men a 
little bit too.

1743
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:41,700
Yeah,
that's.

1744
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:45,380
But,
but why is that like the,

1745
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:46,880
you know,
I feel like hgh,

1746
01:18:46,881 --> 01:18:48,800
just like the male version of Botox,
you know,

1747
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:53,830
guys do like that sort of thing for me 
is just something that puts your body's 

1748
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:55,760
hormones to the same level.

1749
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,320
It was when you were younger.
It's not like,

1750
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:59,150
but you get cut back,
you know,

1751
01:18:59,350 --> 01:18:59,790
you know,
you,

1752
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:02,840
your metabolism increases.
Women are valued by this.

1753
01:19:02,841 --> 01:19:05,000
Men are sort of valued by their brute.
Right?

1754
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:07,730
Yeah.
So when a guy starts botoxing his face,

1755
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,010
like I've met guys before in their 
forehead doesn't move.

1756
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:11,180
I'm like,
what's going on with your forehead,

1757
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:12,260
Bro?
That's how,

1758
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:13,030
you know.
Yeah.

1759
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:15,110
So you have wrinkles.
I have shiny,

1760
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,060
shiny.
Yeah.

1761
01:19:17,061 --> 01:19:20,780
But it gets a weird shiny.
You know what else that is like,

1762
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:25,830
it's just a mct covered wax figure.
It just looks weird like it's pulled in 

1763
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,300
yet because that's a couple things I've 
found out.

1764
01:19:29,301 --> 01:19:33,170
So I am like shiny,
but I also put like oil all over my face

1765
01:19:33,171 --> 01:19:34,490
and sunscreen.
Well that's good.

1766
01:19:34,491 --> 01:19:35,840
Yeah.
And so I'm always like,

1767
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:36,950
you know,
um,

1768
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,050
but because I think that's like 
preventative,

1769
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:40,640
um,
and uh,

1770
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,400
but lasering your face,
what happens when you laser your face?

1771
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:44,090
Because I was like,
oh,

1772
01:19:44,091 --> 01:19:49,091
I'll just do laser to prevent it.
And I had a lot of sun damage but what 

1773
01:19:49,091 --> 01:19:51,390
that does is it removes the hairs on 
your face and then that's shining.

1774
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:52,670
Yeah.
Oh well,

1775
01:19:52,671 --> 01:19:55,430
dance.
We have micro scares.

1776
01:19:55,431 --> 01:19:56,720
Yeah.
Little Peach Fuzz,

1777
01:19:56,780 --> 01:20:00,500
which is what deflects the light and 
when you don't have that you get shiny.

1778
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:04,270
So my dermatologist was like,
we should slow down on the laser because

1779
01:20:04,271 --> 01:20:07,070
you're going to look like a wax figure 
and I'm already pushing it,

1780
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:11,310
you know,
but I scan with the laser is like,

1781
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:14,580
is it similar to like they say that 
women get more wrinkles or on their face

1782
01:20:14,581 --> 01:20:17,940
because they met than men because men 
exfoliate when they shave.

1783
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:21,500
I've never thought about that.
I maybe that's why I don't have wrinkles

1784
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:26,700
like men.
Men get less lines around their lips and

1785
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:30,760
around the corners of their mouth.
They don't have to fake laugh as much as

1786
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:30,760
we do.

1787
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:37,330
They don't have to gamble at bar is all 
the time.

1788
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:40,700
Why is that a thing?
We're,

1789
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:41,510
we're,
we're,

1790
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,280
we're men like women to laugh at them.
It's not odd.

1791
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,740
It's feedback,
it's feedback,

1792
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:48,240
but it's not,
it doesn't the other way.

1793
01:20:48,241 --> 01:20:53,241
It doesn't.
It's not like a lot of now laugh at 

1794
01:20:53,241 --> 01:20:53,241
women.
No Guy.

1795
01:20:53,241 --> 01:20:53,241
No,
that's,

1796
01:20:53,241 --> 01:20:57,471
it's,
it's making a guy laugh as an act of 

1797
01:20:57,471 --> 01:20:57,471
aggression.
It's a competitive.

1798
01:20:57,471 --> 01:21:00,930
It's competitive stone thrown for me.
I'm,

1799
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,040
well,
I already have guys.

1800
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:05,520
So I've been a on this online dating 
app.

1801
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:07,580
Uh,
uh,

1802
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:10,260
well the last one for famous people,
you told me you were on one.

1803
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:11,150
Yeah,
it's that one.

1804
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,060
That one.
Yeah,

1805
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:15,090
same as people.
You can also get on there if you're rich

1806
01:21:15,091 --> 01:21:19,080
or have to be like a certain.
They have an approval board.

1807
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,090
Yeah.
They have like an approval code.

1808
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:23,400
Get the fuck on the approval committee.

1809
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:25,260
Bunch of losers.
I don't know,

1810
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,790
but it's,
it's a,

1811
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:31,850
it's an interesting gaggle of monsters,
but I find there's something very 

1812
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:35,970
fascinating and you can probably answer 
this guys are so mean with their openers

1813
01:21:35,971 --> 01:21:37,500
to me.
Like they're like,

1814
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:38,430
oh,
so you think you're funny?

1815
01:21:38,431 --> 01:21:40,530
Huh?
Like that instead of like,

1816
01:21:40,531 --> 01:21:42,300
Hey,
nice to match with you.

1817
01:21:42,301 --> 01:21:47,301
It's usually an aggressive quip.
Yeah.

1818
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:49,990
Well those guys block them.
Yeah,

1819
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:50,450
yeah,
yeah,

1820
01:21:50,451 --> 01:21:51,280
yeah.
Right away.

1821
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:54,330
Yeah.
But I definitely like being funny.

1822
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:55,200
Well,
I mean think about it,

1823
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:56,010
it's like,
you know,

1824
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:59,160
I'm always fascinated by non physical 
forms of aggression.

1825
01:21:59,161 --> 01:22:04,161
Like eye contact is a form of aggression
and a lot of like if you walked into a 

1826
01:22:04,161 --> 01:22:04,350
bar and made eye contact with a guy from
more than 10 seconds,

1827
01:22:04,351 --> 01:22:04,830
he'd be like,
oh,

1828
01:22:04,831 --> 01:22:06,060
I mean not just because you're Joe 
Rogen,

1829
01:22:06,061 --> 01:22:11,061
but if you were anyone like,
eye contact is like without saying 

1830
01:22:11,061 --> 01:22:11,061
something.
Yes.

1831
01:22:11,061 --> 01:22:11,061
Yes,
exactly.

1832
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:14,610
Are you doing man?
Everything's cool.

1833
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:15,720
Yeah,
we're,

1834
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:16,620
we going to fight her.
Fuck.

1835
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:19,350
There's something.
Something stablish tone.

1836
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:21,590
Eye contact is fascinating.
Uh,

1837
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:22,890
you know,
break dancing.

1838
01:22:22,891 --> 01:22:24,750
I was obsessed with break dancing for a 
long time.

1839
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,230
I cannot pop.

1840
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:32,790
I'm hyper mobile,
my knees locked all the time.

1841
01:22:32,791 --> 01:22:37,791
But um,
by accident I wanted to make a 

1842
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:40,221
documentary.
I started making it in college and I 

1843
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:40,560
would go to these break dancing 
competitions in the bronx and uh,

1844
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:43,530
I was fascinated by when there's break 
dance battles,

1845
01:22:43,531 --> 01:22:48,531
if violence goes down in the area,
kind of like what we were talking about 

1846
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:49,940
the other day earlier today,
this has not been a daylong pockets,

1847
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:51,030
um,
that,

1848
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:56,120
uh,
what are substitutes for violence or 

1849
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,480
they get the same needs met.
That violence gives us competition and,

1850
01:22:57,510 --> 01:23:01,620
and break dancing is one of them.
Rap Battles is one of them.

1851
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,140
Uh,
and I think comedy is one of them.

1852
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:09,520
Uh,
so if comedy and a lot of my standup 

1853
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,630
comes from a place of self defense and 
the implication is you're my attacker.

1854
01:23:10,631 --> 01:23:13,270
So I think that I probably like,
you know,

1855
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,250
uh,
it's becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

1856
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:20,880
See,
I always imagined that your kind of 

1857
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:21,520
comedy comes from you being forced to 
analyze your surroundings.

1858
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:26,880
That is true,
that if you had to make light of 

1859
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:27,430
distressing,
almost like gallows humor.

1860
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:28,120
Yes,
that is true.

1861
01:23:28,121 --> 01:23:30,940
But I did the roasts for awhile and that
is a,

1862
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,850
uh,
a that has an aggressive form of.

1863
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:36,340
He wrote back,
I did not do the roast battle.

1864
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:37,900
I was a judge on one of the ones this 
year,

1865
01:23:37,901 --> 01:23:39,730
but I used to do the,
just the rest.

1866
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:41,740
You were a judge on the comedy central 
one.

1867
01:23:41,741 --> 01:23:43,930
And we were fucking howling because 
Oregon,

1868
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,580
the comedians bar the comedy store.
And you were that young girl.

1869
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:50,260
Olivia.
I love her.

1870
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,350
Uh,
uh,

1871
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:54,580
I know she's really,
she's great.

1872
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:57,220
She's fucking something.
She's great.

1873
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:02,280
Yeah,
and you were going on about her being 

1874
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,170
brave and overcoming like trauma and 
this and that and we're like,

1875
01:24:05,171 --> 01:24:06,250
Jesus Christ,
Whitney,

1876
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:10,450
she can't help it psychologically 
analyze this young lady.

1877
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:12,110
Well,
here's the thing is because roast battle

1878
01:24:12,111 --> 01:24:14,890
was so interesting to me because when 
people aren't famous,

1879
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:20,040
you just have to attack their personal 
life and she was on the one that I did 

1880
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:20,740
recently,
the taped one and everyone was like,

1881
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:24,340
Olivia has been raped by a black guy.
Then I was just like,

1882
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,870
are we just all to pretend?
I mean because you know,

1883
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:31,890
comedy is our anesthesia and we make 
jokes to deflect and to not have to 

1884
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:31,890
really deal with that.
But I was just like,

1885
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:36,361
don't get it twisted.
Like you're going to have to deal with 

1886
01:24:36,361 --> 01:24:36,640
being raped one day.
Like we're all laughing and you're going

1887
01:24:36,641 --> 01:24:39,390
to get a paycheck at the end of this,
but is like an open thing.

1888
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,610
She talked about it or it was on the one
that I would.

1889
01:24:42,611 --> 01:24:45,180
The taping I went to,
she was like,

1890
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:46,810
and then it was like,
you know,

1891
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,560
Mark's brother has autism and committed 
suicide joke,

1892
01:24:50,561 --> 01:24:51,370
joke,
joke,

1893
01:24:51,371 --> 01:24:53,800
and I was just like,
this is too brutal.

1894
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:58,860
Even this is too brutal for me because I
know the mental ramifications of this 

1895
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:03,361
kind of pain and we're all just 
pretending like this person isn't in a 

1896
01:25:03,361 --> 01:25:04,120
tremendous amount of pink.
She's like 20,

1897
01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:05,710
right.
Literally she's 20.

1898
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:07,630
I met her when she was 17.
Crazy.

1899
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,180
She came to the,
she's a beast.

1900
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:13,230
She,
well that's worse than being ratio.

1901
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:21,460
I mean she had even more trauma than I 
thought she was out there for something.

1902
01:25:21,461 --> 01:25:25,000
I forget what she was out there for.
I reached out to her and I was like,

1903
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:27,250
look,
let me fucking funny.

1904
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:27,690
Yeah,
no,

1905
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:32,700
but.
And then in I think Montreal or 

1906
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:32,700
something,
she fell off the stage and it ripped her

1907
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:36,420
calf open and she.
And then she did the roast battle the 

1908
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:37,570
next night in a wheelchair.
She is a warrior,

1909
01:25:37,571 --> 01:25:40,000
but I as someone who.
I'm not comparing my experience to her,

1910
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:42,070
but someone who is 20 who started doing 
comedy,

1911
01:25:42,071 --> 01:25:44,530
who joked about my pain,
that shit caught up with me.

1912
01:25:44,531 --> 01:25:47,560
You can try it out,
run it the same way,

1913
01:25:47,561 --> 01:25:49,030
walked watches,
don't fix it.

1914
01:25:49,031 --> 01:25:50,450
And cars don't fix it.
Laughs.

1915
01:25:50,451 --> 01:25:51,070
Don't fix it.
Either.

1916
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:56,130
Know Freddy Prince in yourself.
It doesn't work and neither does the 

1917
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:56,130
money.
Yeah,

1918
01:25:56,130 --> 01:26:00,980
it's funny.
You know it's like when you laugh at 

1919
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:04,040
pain and then it just becomes a joke.
The pain is still there.

1920
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,870
It's like you didn't kill it with 
laughter.

1921
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:07,710
No.
You just sort of like you.

1922
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:13,080
It's like throwing a bunch of gauze.
Bandages over a swimming pool or no 

1923
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:13,310
pool.

1924
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,900
We'll follow up,
but it is a,

1925
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:21,930
it is a temporary way I think to get 
your power back over your damage or to 

1926
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:25,210
is to alchemize it or sublimated into 
something lucrative or positive.

1927
01:26:25,211 --> 01:26:27,760
Like my negative experience kind of paid
for my house,

1928
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:30,250
but there's a certain point and I'm 
fascinated like,

1929
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,360
you know,
cause I,

1930
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:34,090
I personally think,
I mean I can't speak for every field,

1931
01:26:34,091 --> 01:26:39,091
but in our field in particular,
I think we've lost a couple too many 

1932
01:26:39,091 --> 01:26:39,430
comedians to suicide that just kinda 
come out of nowhere.

1933
01:26:39,850 --> 01:26:42,160
And everyone's like,
how did that happen?

1934
01:26:42,161 --> 01:26:44,330
It's like,
how do you think you heard it?

1935
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:47,590
You heard him every night on the stage.
Why is this so shocking to us?

1936
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:49,110
So,
uh,

1937
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:50,560
you know,
I think I just,

1938
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:53,140
you know,
it's not my business necessarily,

1939
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:55,060
but whenever I see a young comic with 
Ray,

1940
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:57,120
I'm just like,
let him know if you talk about it.

1941
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:58,820
Yeah.
Well that's very nice of you.

1942
01:26:58,821 --> 01:27:03,821
Now it makes sense because I didn't see 
that I walked into the bar right when 

1943
01:27:03,821 --> 01:27:06,590
they had finished and you or we're 
dissecting.

1944
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,140
I'm like fucking hilarious.
She can't help.

1945
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,790
Like psychologically analyzing,

1946
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:15,850
well that's like me important.
I can't enjoy porn because I'm too 

1947
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:16,490
worried about the girl and like why 
she's doing it in comedy.

1948
01:27:16,491 --> 01:27:17,870
I'm,
when she's talking about being raped,

1949
01:27:17,871 --> 01:27:19,730
I'm just like,
should we call a helpline?

1950
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:23,670
I remember I read a story about a guy 
who was in porn that I'd seen in a bunch

1951
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:26,040
of porn films that blew his brains out 
and I was like,

1952
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:27,450
whoa.
I'm like,

1953
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:32,451
even the guys,
because a lot of these people that get 

1954
01:27:32,451 --> 01:27:32,451
involved in porn,
it's like they.

1955
01:27:32,451 --> 01:27:35,550
They came here to be an actor and it 
didn't work out and then somewhere along

1956
01:27:35,551 --> 01:27:36,570
the line someone said,
look,

1957
01:27:36,571 --> 01:27:38,130
you make $2,000
to fuck.

1958
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:39,110
And they went,
all right,

1959
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:44,120
I'm in.
And then back then they really could 

1960
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,410
make a lot of money doing porn.
Now it's even stranger because the money

1961
01:27:46,411 --> 01:27:48,150
went away.
Like there was a guy who was a porn star

1962
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:53,360
and he was producing films and he just,
he lives a few doors down from me and I 

1963
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:53,360
was like,
wow,

1964
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:54,750
this guy's ball,
these bond from porn.

1965
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:59,900
And then the internet came along and you
know how the Internet crippled a lot of 

1966
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:04,080
industries and the people cared,
like people cared about the internet,

1967
01:28:04,081 --> 01:28:06,240
crippling the record industry.
Like it was a big deal.

1968
01:28:06,241 --> 01:28:10,680
The napster issue is a big deal.
No buddy gave a fuck about porn.

1969
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:12,090
It,
it's a very strange thing.

1970
01:28:12,091 --> 01:28:15,150
It's like our,
our shame and watching other people have

1971
01:28:15,151 --> 01:28:15,790
sex.
It,

1972
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:19,290
it transferred over to commerce.
Like the actual commerce of porn,

1973
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:24,470
which is totally legal,
was completely and totally ignored that 

1974
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:27,060
industry essentially vanished and had to
regroup and refigure itself out.

1975
01:28:27,061 --> 01:28:29,190
And I don't understand the economics of 
it.

1976
01:28:29,191 --> 01:28:34,191
I've never really looked into it,
but I know that they don't have DVD 

1977
01:28:34,191 --> 01:28:34,191
sales anymore.
It's Kinda gone.

1978
01:28:34,191 --> 01:28:39,020
And there's also something 
psychologically really annihilating 

1979
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:41,870
about being seen and then not being 
seen.

1980
01:28:41,890 --> 01:28:42,540
You know,
it's like,

1981
01:28:42,541 --> 01:28:47,541
I mean,
I don't know what this person's 

1982
01:28:47,541 --> 01:28:47,580
experienced as.
I can't pretend to know why that guy did

1983
01:28:47,581 --> 01:28:52,581
that,
but I think it was mark Burnett was 

1984
01:28:52,581 --> 01:28:54,180
talking like reality stars.
How many of them killed themselves after

1985
01:28:54,181 --> 01:28:59,181
they've been,
like they have it and then it's taken 

1986
01:28:59,181 --> 01:28:59,181
away from them or they're seen for 
something and then not.

1987
01:28:59,181 --> 01:29:01,080
And there's something really fascinating
like Spencer,

1988
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,120
Heidi,
yeah,

1989
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:05,100
like totally.
And how you self destruct after,

1990
01:29:05,101 --> 01:29:06,300
you know,
humans,

1991
01:29:06,301 --> 01:29:09,900
we don't like things being taken away 
from us but especially being seen and we

1992
01:29:09,901 --> 01:29:12,630
get feel safe or dopamine or whatever it
is from being seen.

1993
01:29:12,631 --> 01:29:17,631
And then we're not seeing anymore.
And porn is probably the most insidious 

1994
01:29:17,631 --> 01:29:18,900
in a way because like,
I mean I even find myself and I'm not as

1995
01:29:18,901 --> 01:29:20,200
famous as you,
I'm like,

1996
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:23,760
but when I don't know if people know me 
or not,

1997
01:29:23,761 --> 01:29:25,470
I get,
I feel really unsafe.

1998
01:29:25,710 --> 01:29:30,710
So if I'm like,
if I'm sitting next to someone on a 

1999
01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:32,610
plane and this happens kind of a lot.
And I'm like,

2000
01:29:32,611 --> 01:29:33,060
okay,
cool.

2001
01:29:33,061 --> 01:29:34,870
He doesn't recognize me.
I changed my hair color,

2002
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:39,950
you know,
a lot of people don't recognize me now 

2003
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:41,540
and uh,
or cool and I'm doing this and I'm like 

2004
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:43,791
doing my dm of writing my Dick Jokes and
I'm picking my nose or doing whatever 

2005
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:43,920
I'm doing.
And at the end of the flight he's like,

2006
01:29:43,921 --> 01:29:45,060
I just want to let you know I'm a big 
fan.

2007
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:46,800
And I'm like,
wait,

2008
01:29:46,801 --> 01:29:51,801
I thought we had an agreement that we 
were just strangers and now you've 

2009
01:29:51,801 --> 01:29:53,020
completely betrayed,
like,

2010
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:54,180
and then I'm like,
well,

2011
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:57,250
and then I just get into this weird 
hitchcock like paranoia of like,

2012
01:29:57,270 --> 01:30:02,270
who knows me who doesn't?
And that's my codependence I have to be 

2013
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:03,570
able to behave in an authentic way 
whether people recognize me or not,

2014
01:30:03,571 --> 01:30:08,571
but it's just sort of this creepy 
feeling I imagined doing porn because 

2015
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:10,530
way more people watch porn and then 
watch anything I've ever done.

2016
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,880
So I'd imagine so many people recognize 
that guy but would never say anything.

2017
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:18,250
Just this weird like secret.
Uh,

2018
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:23,870
I don't know.
It feels like a very pernicious 

2019
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:25,581
existence.
Like not knowing who knows you and who 

2020
01:30:25,581 --> 01:30:25,581
doesn't and everyone pretending they 
don't know you.

2021
01:30:25,581 --> 01:30:27,480
I mean if you're,
I have a lot of people come up to me and

2022
01:30:27,481 --> 01:30:30,570
this was always very like weird guys 
will come up to me.

2023
01:30:30,571 --> 01:30:31,500
They'll be like,
hey,

2024
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:34,470
I don't know who you are,
but my girlfriend loves you.

2025
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:39,471
So can we get a photo of like,
now you're just hurting my look what's 

2026
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:42,000
happening or when people are like,
so,

2027
01:30:42,001 --> 01:30:42,700
uh,
so what,

2028
01:30:42,701 --> 01:30:43,710
what do you do?
You're an intern.

2029
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:48,740
Like I can tell they're pretending not 
to and then I have to engage in this 

2030
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:52,431
weird bad improv game with and I imagine
porn stars because there's so much shame

2031
01:30:53,701 --> 01:30:54,690
in admitting you watch it.

2032
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:57,500
People know you,
but they don't say anything yet.

2033
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,250
I wonder if that's ever going to go 
away.

2034
01:30:59,251 --> 01:31:03,120
The shame of admitting you watch other 
people have sex and that you masturbate.

2035
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:04,500
Like there's,
there's two shames.

2036
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:07,100
They're watching it and there's a shame 
and we'll.

2037
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:08,730
Why do you watch it?
Just watch it.

2038
01:31:08,731 --> 01:31:12,000
Just because I'm interested in just 
beating off.

2039
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:14,760
You're slapping your posts that you're 
doing something.

2040
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:16,860
Something crazy is going on.
It's just,

2041
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:21,890
it is so fascinating.
I mean it's obviously rooted in 

2042
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:24,471
religion.
I would imagine that it's parenting 

2043
01:31:24,471 --> 01:31:24,870
instincts that sort of echoed from the 
time that people came over in the boat.

2044
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:27,960
I feel very safe when I know men 
masturbate because I'm like,

2045
01:31:27,961 --> 01:31:29,550
you're getting your needs met in a 
healthy way.

2046
01:31:29,551 --> 01:31:33,510
You're not just fucking holes in walls 
once a month and like doing,

2047
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,610
you know,
it's like you feel safe.

2048
01:31:35,611 --> 01:31:38,760
I feel safe when I know that I don't 
like waiting for the other shoe to drop.

2049
01:31:38,761 --> 01:31:40,800
Like if I feel like if men don't 
masturbate,

2050
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:44,600
where is it?
Where is it where you're just gonna just

2051
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,330
shoot someone like random,
like,

2052
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,360
you know,
like I don't know.

2053
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:49,040
I don't know.
I know,

2054
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:54,080
I know a lot of guys who have stopped 
masturbating and because they made them 

2055
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:57,570
too crazy and they've managed to go 
years without it and they don't.

2056
01:31:57,630 --> 01:31:59,800
I can't speak for everybody.
They seem really and like,

2057
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:02,890
because I think there were sick of being
like a puppet of this,

2058
01:32:02,891 --> 01:32:07,891
like constant.
I can't pretend to know what it's like 

2059
01:32:07,891 --> 01:32:07,891
to know.

2060
01:32:07,891 --> 01:32:10,980
There's an insidious thing that happens 
with human beings when they don't have 

2061
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,640
intimate interactions with people in 
that way.

2062
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:14,570
People that normally would come carrot 
top.

2063
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,550
Yeah.
I mean I don't know if he's.

2064
01:32:16,730 --> 01:32:18,320
I don't know.
I don't.

2065
01:32:18,321 --> 01:32:23,321
I don't know.
But when I see comedians who don't hang 

2066
01:32:23,321 --> 01:32:23,321
out with other Comedians,
I'm always like,

2067
01:32:23,321 --> 01:32:23,321
oh,
this isn't good.

2068
01:32:23,321 --> 01:32:24,350
This isn't gonna go well.
Well there's a lot of comedians that are

2069
01:32:24,351 --> 01:32:27,140
like super competitive and they don't 
like other Comedians,

2070
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:30,290
which is.
It's really weird because there's so few

2071
01:32:30,291 --> 01:32:32,990
of us.
It's the least competitive field you can

2072
01:32:32,991 --> 01:32:35,520
go into in a weird way.
Yeah.

2073
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:38,360
There's so much demand for comedies,
thousands of comedy clubs.

2074
01:32:38,361 --> 01:32:40,890
Someone else doing well helps you.
You know,

2075
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,490
it's interesting.
I mean,

2076
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:45,530
how many comedy clubs are there and how 
many comedians are there?

2077
01:32:45,531 --> 01:32:46,460
I mean,
I'm talking about this,

2078
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:48,230
like how many comedians can do an hour?

2079
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:53,340
I think there's 500 working professional
headline and Comedians in this country.

2080
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:57,300
I think there's maybe 500,
maybe there's a thousand and I think 500

2081
01:32:57,301 --> 01:32:57,680
of them probably

2082
01:32:57,770 --> 01:33:01,000
they can sell.
You can sell a thousand Friday.

2083
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,110
Friday night.
Yeah.

2084
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:03,430
Oh,
a thousand seats.

2085
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:04,670
It goes down to one theater.
Yeah.

2086
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:07,150
It goes down to what caused that

2087
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:09,730
200 maybe.
Maybe 200 maybe.

2088
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:11,770
Maybe.
Yeah.

2089
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:12,440
$200.

2090
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:17,460
I mean,
is there any other field that has that 

2091
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,640
few people besides like Tiffany Glass 
makers or something?

2092
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:21,760
Yeah,
like neuroscientists or something.

2093
01:33:21,761 --> 01:33:25,000
You know,
there's one at every college and there's

2094
01:33:25,001 --> 01:33:27,970
how many colleges in America,
but there's a lot of shit comics too,

2095
01:33:27,971 --> 01:33:29,980
just like there's probably a lot of shit
neurosurgeons,

2096
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:33,460
but there is this sort of false.
I mean granted to be a comedian,

2097
01:33:33,461 --> 01:33:33,990
there's,
you know,

2098
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:39,360
probably in fight or flight mode anyway 
or some sort of competitive thing 

2099
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:39,730
because it's so hard to do that if you 
do make it.

2100
01:33:39,731 --> 01:33:44,731
There's a very specific neurology there.
But the competition among comedians as 

2101
01:33:44,731 --> 01:33:44,731
so odd to me.

2102
01:33:44,731 --> 01:33:49,270
Well I remember being um,
I got into it straight from fighting and

2103
01:33:49,271 --> 01:33:54,271
I remember being super jealous of people
that were doing well when I was just 

2104
01:33:54,271 --> 01:33:58,621
starting out.
Like I'd see someone on stage on black 

2105
01:33:58,621 --> 01:33:58,621
keys aren't even funny.
Why can't I get up there?

2106
01:33:58,621 --> 01:34:02,120
And then I recognized maybe like a 
couple of years in,

2107
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:03,040
in my career,
I'm like,

2108
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:04,990
wow,
that is a dumb way to think.

2109
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:10,200
And this is some really self.
Because I constantly would just reading 

2110
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:14,880
psychology books and self help books and
just constant trying to analyze my mind 

2111
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,820
because I knew that insecurity was 
tripping me up.

2112
01:34:15,821 --> 01:34:19,370
Whether it was in fighting or whether it
was in comedy insecurity,

2113
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:22,230
like a weird little demon that wrecks 
havoc on them.

2114
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:26,240
Met a lot of times masquerades as 
confidence and ambition.

2115
01:34:26,241 --> 01:34:27,170
So it's hard to

2116
01:34:27,450 --> 01:34:28,160
sort of.
Well,

2117
01:34:28,410 --> 01:34:30,960
he didn't even masquerade with me,
but I would pretend it did.

2118
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:32,970
That would pretend I was confident even 
if I wasn't.

2119
01:34:32,971 --> 01:34:37,971
Yeah.
But I realized somewhere along the line 

2120
01:34:37,971 --> 01:34:38,220
that that line of thinking was very,
very dangerous.

2121
01:34:38,221 --> 01:34:41,430
It was tripping me up and it was keeping
me from reaching my full potential.

2122
01:34:41,431 --> 01:34:46,431
So instead what I realized somewhere I 
had a heart to heart with myself and I 

2123
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:51,141
realized like I got into comedy because 
I love comedy and now all of a sudden I 

2124
01:34:51,141 --> 01:34:53,070
don't love it anymore because when 
someone's doing well,

2125
01:34:53,071 --> 01:34:54,120
I'd be like,
God,

2126
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:59,121
why didn't I think of that?
Or why did I come up with that joke or 

2127
01:34:59,121 --> 01:34:59,450
why he so much better than me?
And then I realized like,

2128
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:02,030
oh you have to be a fan and a 
practitioner,

2129
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:05,270
like you have to stop and then you have 
to support of the comedians and you have

2130
01:35:05,271 --> 01:35:08,000
to like,
it felt hard for me to say,

2131
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:09,900
Hey,
I saw this guy the other night.

2132
01:35:09,901 --> 01:35:11,400
It was fucking brilliant.
God,

2133
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:14,090
he's so funny.
And then somewhere along the line,

2134
01:35:14,091 --> 01:35:16,310
like a couple of years in,
I started doing that again.

2135
01:35:16,311 --> 01:35:21,311
I started being a fan of comedy again 
and then I started running with it and 

2136
01:35:21,311 --> 01:35:24,191
then I realized how few people did that.
And then do you think for supportive of 

2137
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:28,730
all the other comedians around me and 
then develop like a whole clan of people

2138
01:35:28,731 --> 01:35:31,790
that do that.
So if you've noticed like my friends,

2139
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:33,620
like all my really closest comedy 
friends,

2140
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:35,220
we're all super supportive.

2141
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:37,180
I love that about you.
It's so,

2142
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:38,560
it's so cool.
And,

2143
01:35:38,561 --> 01:35:41,400
but how did you like,
did you have to get a,

2144
01:35:41,530 --> 01:35:44,080
like a lot of success before that 
happened?

2145
01:35:44,081 --> 01:35:46,840
Or is that why you success?
That's probably part of it.

2146
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:46,930
Yeah,

2147
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:48,800
it definitely happened before my 
success.

2148
01:35:48,801 --> 01:35:50,510
I was helping people when I was 
terrible.

2149
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:51,920
I wasn't doing well,
you know,

2150
01:35:51,921 --> 01:35:56,921
but I was,
I realized that there was something 

2151
01:35:56,921 --> 01:35:56,921
wrong with my thinking.
Yeah,

2152
01:35:56,921 --> 01:36:01,020
it's the same as martial arts.
Like you don't get good by denying that 

2153
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:04,631
other people are good at good at 
respecting the fact that other people 

2154
01:36:04,631 --> 01:36:06,530
are good looking at yourself and your 
objective analysis of your own skills.

2155
01:36:06,531 --> 01:36:07,370
And they realized like,
wow,

2156
01:36:07,371 --> 01:36:09,380
I got a lot of work to do to reach that 
guy's level.

2157
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:09,670
Well,
yeah.

2158
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,430
And I was like,
look at me.

2159
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:11,090
Like,
you know,

2160
01:36:11,091 --> 01:36:13,940
and I definitely had that in the 
beginning a lot to where,

2161
01:36:13,941 --> 01:36:18,941
I mean I was in the beginning for me,
there was so much about just dealing 

2162
01:36:18,941 --> 01:36:19,670
with aggressive people and recreating my
childhood circumstances.

2163
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:22,580
You weren't really there when I first 
started the comedy store.

2164
01:36:22,581 --> 01:36:25,340
You sort of had your respite from the 
comedy store.

2165
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:29,570
But I had,
I was hazed so hard and I,

2166
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:35,300
Oh uh,
we're fine now and we are totally 

2167
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:38,150
friends now.
But Ran David Taylor.

2168
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:42,590
Oh David has female issues and we're 
fine now.

2169
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:46,760
And we worked through it.
It was really hard for a long time.

2170
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:52,540
But Ari has already never told you the 
story about how he hit my backpack.

2171
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:58,000
No amazing story where every night when 
I would go on stage,

2172
01:36:58,761 --> 01:36:59,400
you know,
there's like,

2173
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:01,310
like in the comedy store,
original room,

2174
01:37:01,311 --> 01:37:04,310
which is sort of our,
at least my kind of like,

2175
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:07,160
it was my church and a lot of ways in my
home.

2176
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:12,250
I'm sick as that sounds like there's a 
back booth like that back row of booths.

2177
01:37:12,831 --> 01:37:17,831
It's kind of for VIP and Mitzi shore 
when she would come in and then there's 

2178
01:37:17,831 --> 01:37:17,831
that hallway in the back where they put 
drinks up.

2179
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:19,770
So I would have a backpack every night I
would go in,

2180
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:23,090
I would put my backpack up there because
it was super dark in there.

2181
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:26,210
And One night I was onstage at some 
comical,

2182
01:37:26,211 --> 01:37:30,060
like one in the morning slot.
Like after Don Maurice was like,

2183
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:32,720
was what I would sort of go up.
And uh,

2184
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:37,870
I had just had my wallet stolen or my 
house broken into and someone stole my 

2185
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:41,831
wallet like two days before.
So it was already in fight or flight 

2186
01:37:41,831 --> 01:37:44,021
mode.
And I got offstage and I couldn't find 

2187
01:37:44,021 --> 01:37:44,330
my backpack and I'm like running around 
and you know,

2188
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:45,440
it's so dark in there,
I'm like,

2189
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:46,690
look.
And I,

2190
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:51,260
I got so scared that someone was.
Because basically what a security person

2191
01:37:51,261 --> 01:37:54,650
that helped me said someone who you're 
probably with all the time,

2192
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:55,920
took your credit card,

2193
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:58,380
copied it,
and then put it back in your wallet.

2194
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:03,470
Like because someone had mentioned there
was a big Bank of America scandal where 

2195
01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:05,170
they copied like 2000 credit cards and 
you know,

2196
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:06,450
it was that,
it was,

2197
01:38:06,451 --> 01:38:11,451
I was a part of that.
So I got in my head that there was 

2198
01:38:11,451 --> 01:38:11,580
someone in my life around me who took my
credit card and like copied it.

2199
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:16,590
And so I was freaking out and everyone 
thought it was probably so funny.

2200
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:19,260
And then I started crying like 
hysterically,

2201
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:21,510
like freaking out crying and what's 
already selling me crying.

2202
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:23,720
He was like,
I'm not owning up to this,

2203
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,490
just like fuck this.
So he just,

2204
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:30,750
he just,
he told me later like we just thought it

2205
01:38:30,751 --> 01:38:32,490
was an aneurysm prank and thought it 
would be funny.

2206
01:38:32,491 --> 01:38:37,491
But then you started crying and then he 
didn't even give me your backpack when 

2207
01:38:37,491 --> 01:38:37,491
she started crying member.

2208
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:42,500
We have to ask Ari how it ended up 
because I did his podcast a couple of 

2209
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,280
years ago and he told me you can't ask 
red because red is hiding.

2210
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:45,690
I don't know if you know this,
but no.

2211
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:50,700
Listen,
I'm going to play this for everybody 

2212
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:52,071
because I'm like,
I've been playing rts a voicemail 

2213
01:38:52,071 --> 01:38:54,420
message because when you call him up,
it says at the subscribers request,

2214
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:57,750
incoming calls have been blocked.
He hasn't paid his bill.

2215
01:38:57,790 --> 01:38:57,980
No,
no,

2216
01:38:57,981 --> 01:38:59,310
no.
Incorrect.

2217
01:38:59,410 --> 01:39:03,030
Our.
He decided to go rogue and he decided to

2218
01:39:03,031 --> 01:39:05,670
go completely off the grid for a couple 
of months now.

2219
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:08,150
He was in Miami.
Mr.

2220
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:11,730
And now apparently he's in some South 
American company country.

2221
01:39:11,731 --> 01:39:12,330
Hold on a second.

2222
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:16,950
This phone does not accept incoming 
calls.

2223
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,780
Message.
See a one to seven.

2224
01:39:20,950 --> 01:39:22,330
Okay.
Well that's normal.

2225
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:28,620
That might mean that he's back state 
side because last week it was in 

2226
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:30,310
Spanish.
When you'd call him up,

2227
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:32,710
it would be a Spanish.
You can't message them or anything.

2228
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:33,820
Nothing.
No.

2229
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:34,920
No email.
No nothing.

2230
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:37,690
Yes.
What's this?

2231
01:39:37,691 --> 01:39:42,691
What's this for?
Fucked up and hung out with Henry 

2232
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:42,691
rollins.
That's what happened.

2233
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:43,800
He fucked up and hung out with Henry 
Rollins,

2234
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:46,600
Henry Rollins,
who is fucking crazy.

2235
01:39:47,410 --> 01:39:52,410
Yeah.
Speaking of adderall and you know he's 

2236
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:52,410
not on.
I don't know.

2237
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:52,410
I have no idea.
He was he,

2238
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:55,050
he was on Ritalin,
right?

2239
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:57,850
Ritalin,
Ritalin or know what it.

2240
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:00,720
Was it Ritalin?
He was on Ritalin when he was disagree.

2241
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,500
This is what,
when he was really young,

2242
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:06,460
he was like a test subject from five to 
17.

2243
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:08,950
His family put him on Ritalin.
Is Doctors,

2244
01:40:08,951 --> 01:40:09,790
whatever.
Whoever it was.

2245
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:12,300
That was heartbreaking.
But he would be like all day,

2246
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:17,110
be like gritting his teeth and holy,
and then after school was over,

2247
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:20,650
you'd be like,
he's fucked.

2248
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:25,860
So anyway,
what he does is Henry rollins has the 

2249
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:27,640
hardest time dealing with human beings 
and not being in motion.

2250
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:31,810
Like he wrote this thing about how he 
gets into deep depression,

2251
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:33,910
like it comes to studying into his 
chest.

2252
01:40:34,030 --> 01:40:36,670
Whenever he's not doing something 
running,

2253
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:38,750
he can't chill.
He's got to go to site.

2254
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:43,540
I heard him on a podcast talking about 
how his assistant makes up fake work for

2255
01:40:43,541 --> 01:40:45,670
him,
like for just to keep them busy,

2256
01:40:46,230 --> 01:40:48,430
like you have to drive out to this thing
and pick up this thing.

2257
01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:52,900
Like he,
she makes things just so she hates being

2258
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:53,710
as assistant

2259
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,690
manager and he was.
I'm sorry,

2260
01:40:55,691 --> 01:40:56,520
Heidi.
Sorry.

2261
01:40:56,540 --> 01:40:57,760
Spreadsheet.
You explained it to me.

2262
01:40:57,761 --> 01:40:59,690
I hate when people say assistant.
I said that I say it.

2263
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:00,940
Sorry.
No you didn't.

2264
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:02,500
We're talking about other people.
So tricia is,

2265
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:05,650
she's like,
I got like a warning shot.

2266
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:10,750
She fires me.
Don't call me assistant motherfucker 

2267
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:10,750
like okay,
got it.

2268
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,510
Um,
so henry picks a spot.

2269
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:15,430
He'll just go,
how about Bali?

2270
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:19,600
And he'll call his travel agent.
The travel agent says,

2271
01:41:19,601 --> 01:41:20,400
yeah,
we can get you out about,

2272
01:41:20,430 --> 01:41:25,430
by the way,
only flies economy because even though 

2273
01:41:25,430 --> 01:41:26,620
he's fucking wealthiest shit drives a 
shitty Mazda six.

2274
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,990
Is that like a masochistic thing?
Yeah,

2275
01:41:28,991 --> 01:41:29,370
yeah,
yeah,

2276
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:34,470
for sure.
Great tee shirts only doesn't probably 

2277
01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:36,040
doesn't own a suit.
Still in like crazy shape.

2278
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,540
He's in good shape.
Got It.

2279
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:42,570
He's not like jacked anymore apparently 
at a bunch of injuries because he was 

2280
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:42,570
battling lifting for.

2281
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:43,060
Yeah.
Anyway,

2282
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:46,150
so he had a podcast that he did with 
Ari,

2283
01:41:46,151 --> 01:41:48,490
which has an amazing podcast.
We're already in him,

2284
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:53,440
met.
I feel like they were in Scotland.

2285
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:56,800
Was it always in Scotland?
Edinburgh,

2286
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:02,410
Edinburgh fest and they started talking 
in the podcast.

2287
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:04,810
Amazing because Henry was talking about 
how he's been doing this.

2288
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:09,990
He's been to over 100 countries.
He travels all over the world and does 

2289
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:12,601
it every year and he does it.
He goes completely off the grid when he 

2290
01:42:12,601 --> 01:42:15,091
does it.
He just goes there and he brings his 

2291
01:42:15,091 --> 01:42:16,531
laptop and his camera.
It takes pictures of people and people 

2292
01:42:16,531 --> 01:42:16,531
going,
what are you doing here?

2293
01:42:16,531 --> 01:42:16,840
And he's like,
I'm here for to meet you man.

2294
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:21,960
And it just meets people and goes places
and hangs out with better wins and goes 

2295
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:26,401
into the fucking desert and winds up in 
dangerous places and dangerous 

2296
01:42:26,401 --> 01:42:30,871
situations.
But then comes back and has these 

2297
01:42:30,871 --> 01:42:30,871
amazing stories from it.

2298
01:42:30,871 --> 01:42:33,400
So Ari just released his or just 
recorded his latest,

2299
01:42:33,401 --> 01:42:38,401
our and had decided that he really needs
to do something radical to generate new 

2300
01:42:38,411 --> 01:42:43,411
material.
He had spent a month in China last year 

2301
01:42:43,411 --> 01:42:43,411
and he came up with a bunch of material 
from that.

2302
01:42:43,411 --> 01:42:46,300
So he decided,
I'm just gonna not talk to people.

2303
01:42:46,301 --> 01:42:49,030
I'm going to not talk to my friends.
I'm not going to talk to anybody.

2304
01:42:49,031 --> 01:42:51,370
I'm not going to use my cell phone.
I'm just going to live.

2305
01:42:51,371 --> 01:42:54,610
I'm just going to go completely off the 
grid and travel the world.

2306
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:55,590
And so,
you know,

2307
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:58,210
he makes a shit ton of money now he's 
got his comedy central show.

2308
01:42:58,211 --> 01:43:00,400
He's,
he's done really well with stand up over

2309
01:43:00,401 --> 01:43:03,040
the last few years and,
which is great to see.

2310
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:06,510
But this thought know it's,
I,

2311
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:11,600
you look,
I mean there's something to be said for 

2312
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:11,600
it.
I mean,

2313
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,780
I feel like our brains are so cluttered 
with chores and route,

2314
01:43:13,850 --> 01:43:15,940
you know,
we were so routinized at this point.

2315
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:18,700
It's like there's something to be said 
for just completely rewiring,

2316
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:20,110
you know?
It's just like,

2317
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:21,070
oh,
he's crazy though.

2318
01:43:21,090 --> 01:43:22,720
Yeah,
I was going to say I also,

2319
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:27,780
I'm in this jumpstart program where it's
like human connection is what keeps us 

2320
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:27,780
sane.
You know,

2321
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:29,710
when I'm alone and isolate like that,
bad,

2322
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:34,780
bad things will happen.
Well are you won't use a smartphone 

2323
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:35,230
anymore because he's addicted to it.
He's like,

2324
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:40,250
it's due to a directive.
It's amazing that he's able to course 

2325
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:40,250
correct that.
He's smartest,

2326
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:42,070
smartest Joel silver uses a flip phone.
Does he ruined?

2327
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:45,250
He gets so much done because it's not 
like dumb text ages.

2328
01:43:45,251 --> 01:43:46,360
Phone calls,
handles it.

2329
01:43:46,361 --> 01:43:48,520
Phone call,
use a little dumb little lg flip phone.

2330
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:49,280
I mean

2331
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:50,750
that's all well and good,
but you know what I do?

2332
01:43:50,751 --> 01:43:52,070
I put my fucking phone down.

2333
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:55,490
There's another level of discipline.
I don't have to just,

2334
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:57,230
you know,
abstain entirely.

2335
01:43:57,231 --> 01:44:02,231
Can you just do that every hour?
I put my phone in the other room and 

2336
01:44:02,231 --> 01:44:02,840
then I go do stuff.
How do you have so much self control?

2337
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,120
I don't know.
I just do,

2338
01:44:06,570 --> 01:44:08,900
but it takes a certain warrior to be 
able to do that,

2339
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:11,140
but I don't do it all the time.
Like sometimes somebody has told me,

2340
01:44:11,150 --> 01:44:16,150
hey,
put your phone down with my wife will 

2341
01:44:16,150 --> 01:44:16,150
tell me that.
Put your phone down.

2342
01:44:16,150 --> 01:44:16,150
You're right.
Yeah.

2343
01:44:16,150 --> 01:44:17,180
But put your attitude.
But I do understand it.

2344
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:18,280
Yeah.
Personally I like,

2345
01:44:18,281 --> 01:44:19,880
I'm not,
I'm not denying it.

2346
01:44:19,881 --> 01:44:24,881
Sometimes you have to just stay awake.
I just have to stay awake because I get 

2347
01:44:24,881 --> 01:44:27,230
real zod me real fast.
Way Better at putting my laptop down.

2348
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:32,270
Yeah.
Because I used to have an issue with 

2349
01:44:32,270 --> 01:44:34,360
like I would just be constantly going on
youtube and search and different 

2350
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:36,740
websites and then you go in those 
youtube spirals that take you down,

2351
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:41,760
down,
down in a spiral of watching people pop 

2352
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:41,760
zits.

2353
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,910
Oh have you seen Dr Pimple popper,
instagram dot.

2354
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:49,940
I can go straight to it.
Jamie and I was watching all the zits 

2355
01:44:50,091 --> 01:44:52,100
get popped for like a good two and a 
half hours.

2356
01:44:52,101 --> 01:44:57,101
But then you know in your,
when you go to youtube and it says 

2357
01:44:57,101 --> 01:44:59,051
suggestions for you,
then you find out the next day what you 

2358
01:44:59,181 --> 01:45:04,181
did for me.
I know I have to get the fuck away from 

2359
01:45:04,181 --> 01:45:05,420
the computer when I get down to animal 
attacks.

2360
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:08,870
We'll go,
go to a good one.

2361
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:12,050
She's got some are called confetti 
streamers,

2362
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,690
the ones that are small and they just 
come out for like a minute.

2363
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,030
She's got some ones that are just 
horrific.

2364
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:19,400
The right hand side,
right hand side,

2365
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:21,530
upper,
upper right there,

2366
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:22,850
right there.
Go to this one.

2367
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,460
She gets a lot of cysts.
Click on that place.

2368
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:28,640
Looking at.
Oh well that's like a pool.

2369
01:45:28,810 --> 01:45:30,680
Here comes puss.
Yeah.

2370
01:45:30,681 --> 01:45:35,681
Yeah.
I mean some of them come out and they 

2371
01:45:35,681 --> 01:45:36,440
come up like goddamn volcanoes.
What is.

2372
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:39,410
So is that fat globules?
That is.

2373
01:45:39,550 --> 01:45:44,550
Oh,
it looks like it literally looks like a 

2374
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:44,550
deer has given her.

2375
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:49,370
Some of them come out and they just 
cream cheese.

2376
01:45:49,730 --> 01:45:51,640
She's got some other ones on her pay.
Let me look at that.

2377
01:45:51,650 --> 01:45:53,350
Five hundred and 79,000
views.

2378
01:45:53,650 --> 01:45:57,140
I think she has millions of followers.
More fascinating than.

2379
01:45:57,380 --> 01:46:02,380
Oh,
she's probably got more followers than 

2380
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:02,430
you and I combined click to see what.
How many followers in wrong?

2381
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:04,070
Twenty 3 million.
Two point three.

2382
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:05,870
Oh,
but you know,

2383
01:46:05,871 --> 01:46:09,810
she only had like 1 million job.
Oh,

2384
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:11,440
the doctors.
Dermatologists.

2385
01:46:11,441 --> 01:46:13,640
Genius was the clit.
Start filming this well,

2386
01:46:13,641 --> 01:46:17,330
and she specializes in puffing.
Probably some dude's got some.

2387
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:19,100
Her name is Sandra Lee.
Uh,

2388
01:46:19,101 --> 01:46:21,310
some dudes got some fucking want your 
life.

2389
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:25,370
Do you know that a grooming for women 
releases endorphins in our brain?

2390
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:27,260
I mean,
does your wife tried to pop your assets?

2391
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:28,550
Were in grounds?
Really?

2392
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:31,010
Know I don't really have any.
Well,

2393
01:46:31,011 --> 01:46:33,700
you're flawless.
Totally not flawless.

2394
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:36,740
Look at that.
That's a baby.

2395
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:41,480
Aliens are twins.
Plus I look at the smaller ones.

2396
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:44,600
Look up to this one.
How about this one?

2397
01:46:44,601 --> 01:46:45,160
Is this one?
Okay.

2398
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:48,510
Pull it out like it was hamburger meat.
How about this one?

2399
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:49,360
This.
I can't.

2400
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:50,010
All right.
I

2401
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:53,370
can do like this better.
Or like these.

2402
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:55,360
What's better?
This or that?

2403
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:57,270
Those are my favorite.
That's my favorite.

2404
01:46:57,271 --> 01:46:59,970
I do that on airplanes in the bathroom.
So the nose,

2405
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:01,610
that's my favorite.
Oh,

2406
01:47:01,611 --> 01:47:02,700
I love it.
Oh,

2407
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:05,120
is it?
Oh,

2408
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:09,670
there aren't a lot of it.
Is it harder to watch that like this?

2409
01:47:09,810 --> 01:47:13,980
Or is it hard to watch the deadline 
deadline,

2410
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:15,160
the deadline.
This.

2411
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:16,560
I'll watch all they did.
Animal,

2412
01:47:17,330 --> 01:47:18,490
you know,
here's my,

2413
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:21,900
the,
your whole approach to hunting is.

2414
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:25,300
I get it like you have a very honorable,
uh,

2415
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:27,790
you have a lot of um,
you know,

2416
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:30,500
you treat on some level then with like 
dignity and into,

2417
01:47:30,501 --> 01:47:31,980
and you have integrity about it.
You know,

2418
01:47:32,270 --> 01:47:33,780
eat meat.
I do eat meat.

2419
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:39,020
Yeah.
So I had eating disorders so I can't 

2420
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:40,050
really like when I start restricting 
things are going,

2421
01:47:40,051 --> 01:47:40,620
I don't need this.

2422
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:42,930
I don't need that.
That can go down like a bad spiral.

2423
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:47,340
I don't actively like seek out meat and 
I don't eat pork really,

2424
01:47:47,370 --> 01:47:50,430
but I can't like start being too 
abstemious pork.

2425
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:52,930
I don't eat pork.
Just I don't want to like you.

2426
01:47:53,110 --> 01:47:55,920
All of your listeners I think would 
probably think I'm very annoyed.

2427
01:47:55,921 --> 01:47:58,700
I'm going to get a lot of like a troll.
Don't worry about that.

2428
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:03,830
It's just once at you.
I mean I think I've just too down the 

2429
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:06,321
rabbit hole of learning about the 
emotional document and capacity of pigs 

2430
01:48:06,321 --> 01:48:08,150
and dogs that it's just kind of like a 
bummer.

2431
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:09,450
Very smart,
very smart,

2432
01:48:09,451 --> 01:48:10,410
and very emotional.
You know,

2433
01:48:10,411 --> 01:48:12,960
they say they're like toddlers.
You got to be around wild pigs.

2434
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:16,290
Wild pigs are monster feral tags.
I'm sure yes,

2435
01:48:16,291 --> 01:48:19,230
but ones that are just raised and killed
and there's also a lot of like,

2436
01:48:19,470 --> 01:48:21,390
maybe this is too metaphysical or 
whatever,

2437
01:48:21,391 --> 01:48:24,930
but like they know what's happening and 
I just,

2438
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:29,960
it's more like you're just eating fear,
so their adrenaline and cortisol just 

2439
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:30,840
like,
you know,

2440
01:48:30,990 --> 01:48:34,460
throbs through their bodies while 
they're getting killed and they just,

2441
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:36,510
they live in fear their entire lives and
there's just,

2442
01:48:36,511 --> 01:48:38,490
you're ingesting that and it's an 
energy,

2443
01:48:38,491 --> 01:48:43,491
you know,
and you know what's fucked and the 

2444
01:48:43,491 --> 01:48:43,491
antibiotics are crazy.

2445
01:48:43,491 --> 01:48:44,460
My Dad has antibiotic resistance right 
now,

2446
01:48:44,461 --> 01:48:49,461
which I think is going to be part of the
next sort of horrific things that we 

2447
01:48:49,461 --> 01:48:50,760
can't control.
Where technology has sort of taken over.

2448
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:52,830
Do you think it's from doctors or from 
lifestyle?

2449
01:48:52,831 --> 01:48:57,831
It's definitely from doctors as well.
Being over prescribed antibiotics every 

2450
01:48:57,831 --> 01:49:01,131
time you have a cold,
every time you have at this take 

2451
01:49:01,131 --> 01:49:01,131
antibiotics and then by the time you 
actually need them,

2452
01:49:01,131 --> 01:49:02,040
they don't work anymore.
And that's where the situation my dad is

2453
01:49:02,041 --> 01:49:02,220
in.

2454
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:07,280
There's a thing that they're just 
researching recently on Komodo dragons 

2455
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,940
and they're looking to Komodo dragons.
I think there's enzymes in their blood 

2456
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:15,860
that they think is going to be effective
in treating people that have resistance 

2457
01:49:16,411 --> 01:49:19,410
to antibiotics for diseases,
bananas.

2458
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:20,820
That was real.
That was today.

2459
01:49:20,821 --> 01:49:21,450
I was reading that.

2460
01:49:21,610 --> 01:49:24,160
Yeah,
it's bananas and I also look.

2461
01:49:24,161 --> 01:49:25,660
It's like again,
you know,

2462
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:27,970
refer me and I'm not generalizing about 
everybody.

2463
01:49:27,971 --> 01:49:28,690
I know this.
For me,

2464
01:49:28,691 --> 01:49:30,850
a lot of things are projections and so 
for me,

2465
01:49:30,851 --> 01:49:35,851
like when an animal is helpless,
I see myself as a helpless child and 

2466
01:49:35,851 --> 01:49:36,850
when I see something in a cage,
maybe the same way that like when you go

2467
01:49:36,851 --> 01:49:38,560
into a room of executives,
you're like,

2468
01:49:38,561 --> 01:49:40,480
I don't want to be this.
When I see something in a cage,

2469
01:49:40,481 --> 01:49:42,760
I just something that's voiceless and 
helpless.

2470
01:49:42,761 --> 01:49:45,650
That's what a kid is.
So it just triggers like a lot of stuff.

2471
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:48,210
I can't go to the pound.
I'll have 100,000

2472
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:49,720
dogs.
I just can't do it.

2473
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:52,840
I do so much animal rescue and I send 
someone to go.

2474
01:49:52,841 --> 01:49:55,780
When I see one that I'm going to rescue,
they go and get them for me because I'll

2475
01:49:55,781 --> 01:49:56,730
just,
I'll lose my mind.

2476
01:49:56,850 --> 01:49:59,140
I'll take them all home,
get a horse.

2477
01:49:59,180 --> 01:50:03,050
I just got where it.
Yeah.

2478
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,700
So I'm Joe.
That's why I'm here today.

2479
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:07,880
I feel like he totally,
he's a,

2480
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:09,100
uh,
at the ha ha.

2481
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:11,080
Um,
but uh,

2482
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:14,440
he was a show horse who,
dressage horse who,

2483
01:50:14,470 --> 01:50:19,470
you know,
after a while they're just useless or 

2484
01:50:19,470 --> 01:50:19,470
like race horses kind of.
So,

2485
01:50:19,470 --> 01:50:22,831
um,
he was going to be a put down and I do 

2486
01:50:22,831 --> 01:50:23,110
equine therapy anyway.
Someone's like,

2487
01:50:23,111 --> 01:50:23,920
do you want them?
And I was like,

2488
01:50:23,921 --> 01:50:25,660
yeah,
my teacher.

2489
01:50:26,170 --> 01:50:27,840
So there's this,
um,

2490
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:30,730
I think you will find this interesting.
I find it fascinating.

2491
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:35,790
I'm horses don't value anything that we 
value money,

2492
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:37,690
prestige,
clout,

2493
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:40,100
I MDB meter,
house,

2494
01:50:40,101 --> 01:50:45,101
they don't care about anything.
Anything that we use to defend 

2495
01:50:45,101 --> 01:50:45,101
ourselves,
uh,

2496
01:50:45,101 --> 01:50:46,330
being funny,
being smart,

2497
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:51,600
they don't care about it.
The only thing they care about is 

2498
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:51,970
authenticity.
So basically,

2499
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:57,210
um,
horses serve kind of as mirrors to your 

2500
01:50:57,210 --> 01:50:57,640
flaws and yeah,
inauthenticity.

2501
01:50:57,910 --> 01:51:00,130
Yeah.
So if you're fake horse recognized,

2502
01:51:00,131 --> 01:51:02,590
they don't understand,
they're repelled by it.

2503
01:51:02,591 --> 01:51:07,591
So if you got a horse around with one of
the real housewives from Beverly Hills 

2504
01:51:07,591 --> 01:51:10,530
and just kill it would kick us out from 
the faith as what I.

2505
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:12,340
um,
but uh,

2506
01:51:12,370 --> 01:51:14,530
so I mean there's a difference.
There's this,

2507
01:51:14,531 --> 01:51:14,970
um,
it's,

2508
01:51:15,330 --> 01:51:18,040
it's based on this philosophy called 
being with horses by this German woman.

2509
01:51:18,041 --> 01:51:20,140
Her name is Sabine,
I don't remember her last name,

2510
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:25,860
but this place called the reflective 
horse is where I keep it in Topanga 

2511
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:26,250
Canyon and you know,
like,

2512
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:31,260
as you know,
therapies used for a lot of people in 

2513
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:31,470
Rehab and sexual abuse victims.
Um,

2514
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:36,540
I'm working with this organization 
called she heard power and Beth behrs 

2515
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:39,721
who I work with is I'm sort of running 
it and it's letting because humans can 

2516
01:51:39,721 --> 01:51:43,060
be so triggering for drug addicts and 
trauma survivors that,

2517
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:43,930
like,
for me,

2518
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:46,090
therapy stopped,
uh,

2519
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:49,000
being able to work because I was so 
triggered by therapists.

2520
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:51,380
I found myself lying to them.
I find,

2521
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:56,040
found myself like literally trying to 
manage their in like,

2522
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:58,420
you know,
I didn't want them to think I was crazy.

2523
01:51:58,450 --> 01:52:01,180
Like it was just,
you're the most awesome and crazy person

2524
01:52:01,181 --> 01:52:04,030
at the same time I've ever met,
but it's like we all do the shit.

2525
01:52:04,031 --> 01:52:05,500
But then I was resentful because I'm 
like,

2526
01:52:05,501 --> 01:52:07,450
I'm fucking paying you and that's all 
you're going to say.

2527
01:52:07,451 --> 01:52:09,340
Like I was combative to them.
I was,

2528
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:10,540
I was.
Well,

2529
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:14,050
because it's like I'm very,
I'm not selfish about my time,

2530
01:52:14,051 --> 01:52:17,860
but I have a healthy understanding about
what is a waste of time.

2531
01:52:17,861 --> 01:52:21,160
And I found a great therapist now who is
like a bad ass and she's like,

2532
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:22,450
you know,
she's five,

2533
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:24,460
two and whereas only mink coats and 
pajamas,

2534
01:52:24,461 --> 01:52:26,390
she's awesome.
She's,

2535
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:28,960
well,
they're like pho for like vests.

2536
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:30,280
Um,
and so,

2537
01:52:30,281 --> 01:52:31,660
but then I was just,
I would get very,

2538
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:36,661
like you and the executive room,
like I would be in a therapist office 

2539
01:52:36,661 --> 01:52:36,661
and it'd be like Harvard Business 
School.

2540
01:52:36,661 --> 01:52:40,860
I'm like,
this fucking guy doesn't know anything 

2541
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:40,860
about problems.
Fuck this guy.

2542
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:43,520
Like I just was like,
I get angry at them and then all of a 

2543
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:43,630
sudden they'd be like,
authority figures to me.

2544
01:52:43,631 --> 01:52:45,170
And that trigger it was,
it was just like.

2545
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:50,770
And then I felt weird talking about 
boundary stuff or sexual stuff and I 

2546
01:52:50,770 --> 01:52:50,770
don't,
you know,

2547
01:52:50,770 --> 01:52:53,000
the shame that comes with saying I 
watched porn or this or that,

2548
01:52:53,001 --> 01:52:57,110
like it just wasn't working for me.
And then equine therapy,

2549
01:52:57,111 --> 01:52:58,530
you essentially,
um,

2550
01:52:58,610 --> 01:53:01,400
it's not about dominating the horse and 
it really illuminates,

2551
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:06,730
you know,
our instinct to control and be perfect 

2552
01:53:06,730 --> 01:53:07,500
and achieve and those are sort of the 
things I'm working on right now.

2553
01:53:07,501 --> 01:53:10,010
Like,
like I have like crippling perfectionism

2554
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:13,360
where I feel like you and I have been,
you have,

2555
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:18,420
but you're interesting because you're 
one of the few people I know who's 

2556
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:21,730
incredibly successful but you don't seem
to have a perfectionism issue like you 

2557
01:53:22,581 --> 01:53:25,790
achieve a lot without an obsessed about 
achieving.

2558
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:31,120
Does that make sense?
I have a perfectionism issue and like 

2559
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:32,540
with writing this new our,
like we've been texting about this,

2560
01:53:32,541 --> 01:53:37,541
you're like doing a couple of guys.
I was trying to come to this house and 

2561
01:53:37,541 --> 01:53:37,541
I'm like,
yes I do.

2562
01:53:37,541 --> 01:53:37,541
But I don't have a new.
Like I can't get.

2563
01:53:37,541 --> 01:53:39,430
You only have to do whatever you want to
do at the ice house.

2564
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,120
You can do 10 minutes or 15,
but I'm like,

2565
01:53:41,121 --> 01:53:43,690
if I don't do it perfectly,
I know.

2566
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:45,230
That's so crazy.
It's crazy.

2567
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:50,260
Yes.
Because in my household I only got 

2568
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:50,260
rewarded for being perfect.
There's no perfect in comedy,

2569
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:51,290
no such thing.
It's a,

2570
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:54,080
it's a 100 percent.
So this is why,

2571
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:59,100
like with horses,
if you're trying to be perfect or 

2572
01:53:59,100 --> 01:53:59,100
control the outcome and you can't 
control a horse there,

2573
01:53:59,230 --> 01:54:00,610
the thousand pounds,
you can't,

2574
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:01,330
they,
if they're,

2575
01:54:01,550 --> 01:54:02,810
you know,
when you're alone with it in a ring,

2576
01:54:02,811 --> 01:54:06,470
not dominating it or controlling it or 
using any kind of,

2577
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:09,590
um,
a manipulation devices,

2578
01:54:09,890 --> 01:54:14,450
you really can only be authentic and 
detach from the results of like,

2579
01:54:14,451 --> 01:54:16,670
I need the horse to run and jump and do 
all these things.

2580
01:54:16,670 --> 01:54:20,060
They're not going to do what you in your
mind think is perfect.

2581
01:54:20,061 --> 01:54:22,510
So it's about like detaching from 
results.

2582
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:25,670
Let me ease your concerns because I 
definitely have perfection issues.

2583
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:27,200
How?
But I just let them go.

2584
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:29,160
Well,
I,

2585
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:34,370
I don't like anything.
I do really almost nothing.

2586
01:54:34,430 --> 01:54:39,430
I don't like any of my comedy.
I don't watch anything I do because I 

2587
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:40,790
break it down so much.
I go over it so much.

2588
01:54:40,791 --> 01:54:43,040
You get sick of it.
I make notes.

2589
01:54:43,041 --> 01:54:45,350
Yeah.
I go over to change things.

2590
01:54:45,351 --> 01:54:49,530
If we flub a word,
I want to jump into an oncoming train.

2591
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:51,170
The audience loves it.
They're like,

2592
01:54:51,171 --> 01:54:53,000
he's human.
He flubs herds like,

2593
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:54,680
well,
if I recover it's fun,

2594
01:54:54,681 --> 01:54:57,020
but there's,
I just,

2595
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:59,330
it bothers me when I don't do something 
right.

2596
01:54:59,331 --> 01:55:04,331
And he definitely bothers me,
but I've learned how to manage that 

2597
01:55:04,331 --> 01:55:04,340
bother over the years where it doesn't.

2598
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:05,840
I don't go crazy.
Yeah,

2599
01:55:06,230 --> 01:55:10,250
and I think part of that is,
I don't know if there's a lot of factors

2600
01:55:10,251 --> 01:55:12,290
there.
Part of it is understanding that it's an

2601
01:55:12,291 --> 01:55:17,291
issue and then figuring out why and then
I'd spend a lot of time doing things 

2602
01:55:17,291 --> 01:55:21,911
like meditating or taking a lot of yoga.
I do occasionally again in my isolation 

2603
01:55:24,531 --> 01:55:27,890
tank and work things out in there.
When I do yoga,

2604
01:55:27,950 --> 01:55:32,950
I,
I can't eat because I'm so like need to 

2605
01:55:32,950 --> 01:55:32,950
be doing it per like,
I,

2606
01:55:32,950 --> 01:55:33,950
you know,
and it comes and goes,

2607
01:55:34,490 --> 01:55:36,760
but it really is.
Especially when I'm,

2608
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:41,810
I'm like get really busy and like out of
control and out of touch,

2609
01:55:41,811 --> 01:55:46,811
like I resort to my is what gets me 
attention and that's how I will survive 

2610
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:51,300
very like primitive thinking because 
that's what worked for me as a child.

2611
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:52,590
Well,
it seems like you're all,

2612
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:57,000
you're aware of all these issues which 
is like step at least step one.

2613
01:55:57,100 --> 01:56:02,100
Well I think the real thing and,
and your proof that you can do it as 

2614
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:05,521
like,
can you release your protection 

2615
01:56:05,521 --> 01:56:07,170
mechanisms or the things that worked for
you or the things that.

2616
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:12,270
Because I think a lot of my 
perfectionism has worked in a lot of 

2617
01:56:12,270 --> 01:56:15,271
ways.
I have achieved things and because of 

2618
01:56:15,271 --> 01:56:18,811
it,
but it has started to actually hold me 

2619
01:56:18,811 --> 01:56:18,811
back.
So can you,

2620
01:56:18,811 --> 01:56:23,130
the thing,
the sort of maladaptive behavior that 

2621
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:24,710
has worked for you professionally,
can you release it and still will you,

2622
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:25,240
you are also,

2623
01:56:26,050 --> 01:56:28,020
you're single and your,
um,

2624
01:56:28,150 --> 01:56:33,150
your,
you're not finding people that are 

2625
01:56:33,150 --> 01:56:33,150
competitive.

2626
01:56:33,150 --> 01:56:36,210
I love that you just said that because 
I'm finding it was bleeding into my 

2627
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:36,820
dating.
I was like,

2628
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:39,180
you're not like,
you know,

2629
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:41,850
I think a lot of dating as being able to
just go like,

2630
01:56:41,910 --> 01:56:43,410
I'm flawed,
you're flawed.

2631
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:45,450
I'm going to stop picking you apart.
Like.

2632
01:56:45,451 --> 01:56:48,540
Because I think there's an overachiever 
mentality that sometimes bleeds into our

2633
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:50,730
personal life of like,
but what if there's someone better?

2634
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:52,160
Well,
if you don't feel safe to,

2635
01:56:52,161 --> 01:56:57,161
you also have predatory instincts.
Will you find that were week thing and 

2636
01:56:57,161 --> 01:56:57,161
you're like,
look at that.

2637
01:56:57,161 --> 01:56:57,560
And Scott got a wimp.
You know,

2638
01:56:57,561 --> 01:56:59,020
he's got a mental limp.
Yes.

2639
01:56:59,021 --> 01:57:00,000
Yeah.
And then you go,

2640
01:57:00,050 --> 01:57:05,050
oh,
he might be full of shit or he might be 

2641
01:57:05,050 --> 01:57:05,050
pretending he's something he's not.
Or he might be.

2642
01:57:05,050 --> 01:57:05,440
Totally.
Yeah,

2643
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:06,790
totally.
But like,

2644
01:57:06,791 --> 01:57:08,580
that's so am I.
sometimes,

2645
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:09,630
you know,
I've done that.

2646
01:57:09,631 --> 01:57:10,470
I do that,
you know,

2647
01:57:10,471 --> 01:57:13,320
at what point do you just commit and 
accept like,

2648
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:15,450
um,
somebody and I don't,

2649
01:57:15,451 --> 01:57:16,650
I don't know the answer.

2650
01:57:16,860 --> 01:57:21,860
Well,
it's going to be hard to find someone 

2651
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:21,860
who can keep up with you.
That's going to be a big part.

2652
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:24,720
Yup.
Yup.

2653
01:57:25,270 --> 01:57:30,270
For sure.
One hundred percent in love that it has 

2654
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:30,370
to.
But is that going to be exact?

2655
01:57:30,371 --> 01:57:35,371
I mean I've dated guys that are very 
high functioning Alpha type a's and it 

2656
01:57:35,441 --> 01:57:36,070
was exhausting.

2657
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:39,110
Well that doesn't necessarily have to be
exhausting.

2658
01:57:39,111 --> 01:57:42,010
You just have to find someone who's 
known knows that look,

2659
01:57:42,050 --> 01:57:47,050
you can have a car that's 600 horsepower
and not know what the fuck to do with 

2660
01:57:47,050 --> 01:57:51,251
it.
And you're going sideways around every 

2661
01:57:51,251 --> 01:57:51,500
corner just because you have all that 
power and all that energy.

2662
01:57:51,550 --> 01:57:53,420
It doesn't mean you're utilizing it 
correctly.

2663
01:57:53,630 --> 01:57:58,630
Or You could have a car that has 600 
horsepower and you take every corner 

2664
01:57:58,630 --> 01:58:02,681
perfectly and you know when it hit the 
gas and it's always there when you need 

2665
01:58:02,681 --> 01:58:02,681
it,
but you don't use it.

2666
01:58:02,681 --> 01:58:02,940
Yeah.
Just chill.

2667
01:58:03,310 --> 01:58:04,850
Do you talk about this?
I don't know.

2668
01:58:04,851 --> 01:58:05,630
I figured it out.

2669
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:08,900
How did you know that you were like,
I'm gonna commit to this person?

2670
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:10,700
No.
Oh Shit.

2671
01:58:10,730 --> 01:58:11,720
Or like any day now.

2672
01:58:14,710 --> 01:58:15,330
Actually,
no,

2673
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:17,830
I just got to be.
You have to feel,

2674
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:23,220
feel safe with the person,
feel calm when the person enjoy being 

2675
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:23,220
around them,
you know?

2676
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:25,070
And there the other thing is a person 
like you or me or anyways,

2677
01:58:25,071 --> 01:58:28,660
so you have a lot of options.
That's an issue too because if you don't

2678
01:58:28,661 --> 01:58:29,920
have any,
if you live in a small town,

2679
01:58:29,921 --> 01:58:31,830
it's only a few people.
You find someone quickly,

2680
01:58:31,900 --> 01:58:32,610
musical chairs.

2681
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:35,690
No,
but

2682
01:58:35,930 --> 01:58:37,390
you have a lot of options.
You're like,

2683
01:58:37,391 --> 01:58:39,280
well this guy is just not quite doing 
the farming.

2684
01:58:39,310 --> 01:58:42,070
Let me just fucking go test the waters.
And then you're out

2685
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:45,050
there checking your dating app and who.
So you throw your phone in your home.

2686
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:48,010
It's a full time job.
Also like I see,

2687
01:58:48,210 --> 01:58:49,450
you know,
and this is a generalization,

2688
01:58:49,451 --> 01:58:50,770
but a lot of people that I know that 
are,

2689
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:55,990
you know,
getting the most of being the most 

2690
01:58:55,990 --> 01:58:59,431
effective in life do have calm,
predictable home lives or healthy.

2691
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:04,180
If you were going out every night to 
Winston's,

2692
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:05,140
what's Wednesday?
I don't know.

2693
01:59:05,470 --> 01:59:08,520
It's like a glove in La at Winston.
This.

2694
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:09,970
No,
whatever.

2695
01:59:09,971 --> 01:59:13,270
If you were going to Maggio is little 
Italy at the grove every night trying to

2696
01:59:13,271 --> 01:59:18,271
pick up girl,
you would have no time to build an 

2697
01:59:18,271 --> 01:59:18,271
empire.
There is no time to work.

2698
01:59:19,130 --> 01:59:20,230
It's a full time job.
Well,

2699
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:23,650
that's a debt is a real issue with 
trying to settle.

2700
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:29,500
I'm in the market to compromise.
Well then you'll probably find someone 

2701
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:31,150
if you're willing to compromise,
but are you really willing to compromise

2702
01:59:31,151 --> 01:59:35,530
or you just saying that right now,
once there's a guy there and he's flawed

2703
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:38,660
and you think about guys that you used 
to date that weren't flawed.

2704
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:45,910
Yeah,
but I'm trying to not view objectify 

2705
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:45,910
people that way.
It's like I'm flawed too.

2706
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:48,550
Like where do I get off?
We're all flawed for sure.

2707
01:59:48,660 --> 01:59:53,660
I also think like there's this and 
there's this and I don't know if it's 

2708
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:55,300
that feminism,
like we can leave that out of it,

2709
01:59:55,301 --> 01:59:57,850
but there's this new trend where women,
uh,

2710
01:59:57,851 --> 02:00:00,040
my girlfriend's,
a lot of them who are like,

2711
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:02,620
I deserve better than this.
And I'm like,

2712
02:00:03,070 --> 02:00:03,610
no,
you don't.

2713
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:07,370
You're a b minus,
you deserve a b minus.

2714
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:09,800
For me,
when I'm like,

2715
02:00:09,850 --> 02:00:11,410
I deserve this and this.
I'm like,

2716
02:00:11,411 --> 02:00:12,640
no,
I don't like,

2717
02:00:12,641 --> 02:00:17,080
I deserve someone who's kind of a mess.
I think you could certainly get lucky.

2718
02:00:17,081 --> 02:00:18,790
I think I definitely got lucky with my 
wife.

2719
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:20,830
She's a really nice person.
She's smart,

2720
02:00:20,831 --> 02:00:22,930
she's calm,
she's very patient.

2721
02:00:22,931 --> 02:00:25,540
Must be easy to get along with.
I think for me,

2722
02:00:25,541 --> 02:00:27,160
and this is the first time I've thought 
this way,

2723
02:00:27,161 --> 02:00:28,970
it's maybe not about who that person is.

2724
02:00:28,970 --> 02:00:31,900
It's about who I am with that person.
That's the everything.

2725
02:00:31,901 --> 02:00:36,901
That's everything because you who you 
are like we were talking about this 

2726
02:00:36,901 --> 02:00:40,141
before,
if you're around people that are 

2727
02:00:40,141 --> 02:00:40,690
negative,
shit bleeds off into your brain and when

2728
02:00:40,691 --> 02:00:42,910
you're around people that are nice,
you feel nicer.

2729
02:00:43,290 --> 02:00:44,480
Who are you around?
You're like,

2730
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:47,560
you're calm and you're Scott.
I tried to be this guy all the time,

2731
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:49,780
you know?
For the most part I am.

2732
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:54,960
I just don't want to go home and work 
though some hammered or you drink 

2733
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:59,560
definitely drink or you to do like what?
Like like I don't want to guess.

2734
02:00:59,850 --> 02:01:02,460
I mean I've been drunk a bunch of times 
on podcasts,

2735
02:01:02,461 --> 02:01:03,720
just trying to make it more fun.
Oh,

2736
02:01:03,730 --> 02:01:05,170
I respect.
I listen to them.

2737
02:01:06,060 --> 02:01:09,760
You could do that.
Let's do that one will get hammered.

2738
02:01:09,770 --> 02:01:11,200
High Five.
Let's do that.

2739
02:01:11,201 --> 02:01:15,730
That'd be fun to Uber Home.
This is what happens when we're sober.

2740
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:21,360
We're just watching zip pop,
popping years that we're just going to 

2741
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:24,831
watch animal attacks.
We're gonna Watch all those guys in 

2742
02:01:24,831 --> 02:01:25,990
China while I was in China where they 
keep sneaking those animal enclosures.

2743
02:01:26,290 --> 02:01:31,290
Wait,
did joe let Whitney pop his backset 

2744
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:35,000
found on a podcast?
We get ingrown hairs or something.

2745
02:01:37,710 --> 02:01:39,130
Friends,
when I see x,

2746
02:01:39,590 --> 02:01:40,400
I'm like,
can I get it?

2747
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:41,200
Can I get it?
They're like,

2748
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:43,190
we're not dating anymore.
You don't get to do that.

2749
02:01:43,191 --> 02:01:45,650
It's grooming.
Were monkeys were monkeys with guns?

2750
02:01:46,930 --> 02:01:50,920
We're just monkeys.
We talked about this last time that um,

2751
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:55,980
uh,
a Bonobo apes and humans have more 

2752
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:56,450
similar DNA than African elephants in 
Indian elephants.

2753
02:01:57,880 --> 02:01:59,210
No Apes.
It's really fascinating.

2754
02:01:59,211 --> 02:02:04,211
They're the,
they have one restriction sexually the 

2755
02:02:04,211 --> 02:02:05,030
mother won't have sex with the sun.
That's it.

2756
02:02:05,930 --> 02:02:08,360
Women who have sex with women.
Men have sex with men.

2757
02:02:10,530 --> 02:02:15,530
That's like a good genetic sort of 
survival instinct because doesn't that 

2758
02:02:15,530 --> 02:02:18,230
incest is breeds with the dad fucks his 
daughters.

2759
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:20,210
Oh,
that's not fair.

2760
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:21,140
Nope.
Rude.

2761
02:02:21,540 --> 02:02:25,040
That like a freaking equality.
It is A.

2762
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:30,100
I might not be pronouncing this right.
A gyn ocracy like apparently they call 

2763
02:02:30,100 --> 02:02:32,600
it a Gyn ocracy because they use their 
vaginas to get what they want is power.

2764
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:33,490
That's interesting.
Yeah.

2765
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:36,530
I mean some people humans do that.
It is fascinating that they're the least

2766
02:02:36,531 --> 02:02:38,770
violent champion the month that has the 
most sex.

2767
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:40,460
Oh yeah.
By far.

2768
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:41,030
Well,
yeah.

2769
02:02:41,031 --> 02:02:43,630
I mean that's another way to get your 
aggression out.

2770
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:45,830
That's been sort of our theme today.
Well,

2771
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:51,030
I've been thinking about this whole lot 
lately when I examine human culture and 

2772
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:55,091
civilization and all the fucking 
atrocities that we commit on a daily 

2773
02:02:55,091 --> 02:02:55,610
basis.
And then I look back at,

2774
02:02:55,690 --> 02:03:00,690
you know,
I was reading this piece about ancient 

2775
02:03:00,690 --> 02:03:01,310
man and you know,
the trials and tribulations,

2776
02:03:01,311 --> 02:03:03,320
neanderthals and Homo sapiens how to 
deal with.

2777
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:08,740
And I was thinking what is the 
difference between Neanderthal in Cro 

2778
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:11,210
Magnon?
Good question.

2779
02:03:11,390 --> 02:03:15,380
I always get this wrong.
Cro-Magnon is the early version of us.

2780
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:20,040
The tall is a different different breed 
of human neanderthal.

2781
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:21,110
We're humans,
right?

2782
02:03:21,111 --> 02:03:22,740
I conflate them all the time and I.
Okay,

2783
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:24,210
now I understand that.

2784
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:29,240
I think cro magnon is not us though.
It's not like it's not homo sapiens.

2785
02:03:29,991 --> 02:03:32,240
I don't think.
I always like Australia.

2786
02:03:32,241 --> 02:03:34,910
Pythagoreous I think was the first 
human,

2787
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:39,500
the first human like creature honor to 
be the dumbest person on your podcast.

2788
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:42,110
I don't think.
You definitely never done clearly.

2789
02:03:42,111 --> 02:03:44,620
You've never met Brian Red band 
skeleton.

2790
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:47,300
Say Brian Gallon.
They had a unliked neanderthals,

2791
02:03:47,301 --> 02:03:49,160
cro,
magnon and not a separate species.

2792
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:55,540
In fact,
they're the earliest known European 

2793
02:03:55,540 --> 02:03:55,540
example of our species living between 
$35,000

2794
02:03:55,540 --> 02:03:56,030
and 10,000
years ago.

2795
02:03:56,180 --> 02:03:59,060
That's what's so fucked up.
Ten thousand years ago is nothing.

2796
02:03:59,090 --> 02:04:00,200
Nothing.
It's a,

2797
02:04:00,290 --> 02:04:02,150
it's a,
it's a second.

2798
02:04:02,270 --> 02:04:05,420
And then actually modern in every 
anatomical way.

2799
02:04:05,690 --> 02:04:08,300
Huh?
You guys learned something in a.

2800
02:04:08,301 --> 02:04:09,470
that's nuts.
10,000

2801
02:04:09,471 --> 02:04:12,140
years is so recent.
And here's the craziest thing.

2802
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:15,110
They only existed 175,000
years ago.

2803
02:04:15,111 --> 02:04:17,450
The emerged.
So 175,000

2804
02:04:17,451 --> 02:04:18,440
years ago,
humans emerged.

2805
02:04:18,441 --> 02:04:20,630
So before 175,000
years ago,

2806
02:04:20,780 --> 02:04:23,870
which is a blink in time roughly.
They don't really know the,

2807
02:04:24,250 --> 02:04:24,740
you know,
the,

2808
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:26,690
the,
the changes there,

2809
02:04:26,691 --> 02:04:28,670
their estimate changes based on fossil 
evidence.

2810
02:04:28,940 --> 02:04:31,160
But that's so recent.
Recently,

2811
02:04:31,610 --> 02:04:34,820
what I was thinking is when we're 
looking at are our issues,

2812
02:04:34,821 --> 02:04:39,821
you know,
dating and love and friendship and 

2813
02:04:39,821 --> 02:04:39,821
creativity

2814
02:04:39,821 --> 02:04:42,000
and ambition,
all these weird issues that human beings

2815
02:04:42,001 --> 02:04:42,840
have today in this

2816
02:04:43,190 --> 02:04:46,960
and weirdly luxurious world problems 
left and right.

2817
02:04:47,870 --> 02:04:50,530
That's like 100 years old.
Yeah.

2818
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:52,850
Yeah.
What

2819
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:55,220
is the future going to be like?
Like what?

2820
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:59,630
What is a modern human in the year 20 
slash 75

2821
02:05:01,130 --> 02:05:02,830
going to be Vr,
right?

2822
02:05:02,860 --> 02:05:07,860
I mean,
aren't we all just going to be in our 

2823
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:07,860
virtual reality machines just 
masturbating and.

2824
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:09,450
Well,
we might be the last people to touch our

2825
02:05:09,451 --> 02:05:14,451
genitals.
Probably this will be the last pussy 

2826
02:05:14,451 --> 02:05:14,451
spanking generation.

2827
02:05:14,451 --> 02:05:14,451
The last,
maybe the last few.

2828
02:05:14,451 --> 02:05:17,320
Maybe sex will be fake.
I mean there was a book called,

2829
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:22,350
I'm sorry to circle back to porn again,
but there's a book called porn nation 

2830
02:05:22,350 --> 02:05:26,040
and in it there was a statistic that 
said 80 percent of kids under 18 boys 

2831
02:05:27,791 --> 02:05:30,520
would rather watch porn than have sex 
with an actual woman.

2832
02:05:32,370 --> 02:05:34,530
Wrong fact check it.
Focus groups,

2833
02:05:35,130 --> 02:05:38,920
it's probably a very specific group of 
people who would agree to be interviewed

2834
02:05:38,921 --> 02:05:42,760
about whatever the same assholes.
I think women have to masturbate in tubs

2835
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:46,780
only.
No Kid.

2836
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:48,970
So,
but I mean who knows?

2837
02:05:48,971 --> 02:05:52,270
I mean you could fake fake boobs,
fake news.

2838
02:05:52,490 --> 02:05:54,160
Uh,
you could probably prefer because you're

2839
02:05:54,161 --> 02:05:56,170
in control of it.
If you have a vr woman who's going to do

2840
02:05:56,171 --> 02:06:01,171
whatever you want,
you don't have to deal with her 

2841
02:06:01,171 --> 02:06:01,171
afterwards and like talk about like what
are we?

2842
02:06:01,171 --> 02:06:02,620
But that's half the thrill you have to.

2843
02:06:03,090 --> 02:06:07,330
But you didn't grow up on fake women and
Anna May.

2844
02:06:07,390 --> 02:06:09,580
Wow.
Jerking off to cartoons.

2845
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:16,430
You don't understand.
Like we watched Saturday morning 

2846
02:06:16,430 --> 02:06:20,671
cartoons.
They are jerking off to animate and 

2847
02:06:20,671 --> 02:06:20,671
white men.
Oh God.

2848
02:06:20,671 --> 02:06:21,580
So why,
how many,

2849
02:06:22,120 --> 02:06:23,490
how many of them?
Most of them are jerking.

2850
02:06:24,570 --> 02:06:29,340
Will you look up in an animated like how
many people are poor?

2851
02:06:30,810 --> 02:06:32,560
I would say it's a very small number by 
the way.

2852
02:06:32,561 --> 02:06:36,220
A lot of the women in real porn or more 
lifeless than the animated important,

2853
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:40,540
but they're weird now because it 
couldn't fake ass as well.

2854
02:06:40,541 --> 02:06:45,541
It's like John beaudry yards,
like theory of like simulacrum about 

2855
02:06:45,541 --> 02:06:49,111
like how we prefer this simulation of 
something to the original of something 

2856
02:06:49,111 --> 02:06:53,910
when we can actually control it.
I think Andy Warhol was onto that as 

2857
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:53,910
well,
but.

2858
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:55,740
Well isn't it bizarre that some men 
prefer fake boobs?

2859
02:06:56,050 --> 02:06:57,600
Like they get.
Why?

2860
02:06:57,601 --> 02:06:58,380
Donald?
Why?

2861
02:06:58,381 --> 02:07:03,381
Getting off to anime porn is shorthand 
for supporting Donald Trump connection.

2862
02:07:03,780 --> 02:07:08,780
Lorin griset.
How to say the name or Sydney or Sydney.

2863
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:10,920
Oh,
this just happened to pop up,

2864
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,020
but what a bizarre fucking title.
Okay.

2865
02:07:13,021 --> 02:07:14,460
Let's.
Let's see what she has to say.

2866
02:07:14,590 --> 02:07:17,660
God Damn it.
Forbes continue to push forward.

2867
02:07:17,661 --> 02:07:18,750
Yeah,
it's hilarious.

2868
02:07:18,751 --> 02:07:22,950
On Tuesday evening,
gop consultant Rick Wilson made twitter,

2869
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:24,960
but to do waves with.
Look at that.

2870
02:07:24,961 --> 02:07:26,880
They have the fucking stock of twitter,
right?

2871
02:07:26,881 --> 02:07:29,670
They're single men plus zero,
50 percent,

2872
02:07:29,671 --> 02:07:34,671
zero point 50 percent in that hilarious.
They showed twitter and then they have 

2873
02:07:34,671 --> 02:07:35,400
people reading Forbes.
What we'll just stock at

2874
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:38,700
the stock number right next to the 
audience.

2875
02:07:38,830 --> 02:07:43,830
So weird waves with his claim that 
donald trump's supporters are mostly 

2876
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:47,601
single men who masturbate to way.
He's at glp consultant too.

2877
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:54,920
I think they're right with this 
unintentionally incendiary statement 

2878
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:58,620
that Wilson says he made directly to 
troll trump's followers.

2879
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:01,530
February's trolling everybody.
First of all,

2880
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:04,620
as any enemy fan will let you know.
It's called,

2881
02:08:04,850 --> 02:08:06,030
um,
clears throat.

2882
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:11,160
Hentai a specific genre of x ray to 
Japanese animated cartoons.

2883
02:08:11,820 --> 02:08:14,820
But what's interesting is that in order 
to intentionally make people angry,

2884
02:08:14,821 --> 02:08:17,730
Wilson targeted anime Geeks as his 
insults.

2885
02:08:17,750 --> 02:08:18,100
Okay.

2886
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:20,340
It's tweet.
Don't upset them.

2887
02:08:20,510 --> 02:08:21,020
Yeah.
They'll,

2888
02:08:21,050 --> 02:08:24,630
they'll find you reply you.
I don't know.

2889
02:08:24,631 --> 02:08:26,510
I can't,
I can compete with I,

2890
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:28,530
I feel strongly that's.
I'm like,

2891
02:08:28,531 --> 02:08:30,150
okay,
I can compete with the girl I've seen.

2892
02:08:30,390 --> 02:08:32,530
I can't compete with cartoons.
Yeah.

2893
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:33,770
That cellulite,
it's,

2894
02:08:33,870 --> 02:08:36,540
it's,
I really don't want to have stats on how

2895
02:08:36,541 --> 02:08:41,541
many people,
how one website is convincing people to 

2896
02:08:41,541 --> 02:08:43,400
pay for cartoon porn.
If you're paying for cartoon port,

2897
02:08:43,401 --> 02:08:45,180
just watch Jessica Rabbit.

2898
02:08:45,240 --> 02:08:46,470
Whoa.
Hold on a second.

2899
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:51,560
Among 18 to 34 year old viewers,
cartoon and hand tie are the 13th and 

2900
02:08:52,021 --> 02:08:57,021
17th most popular porn searches.
And millennials are 131 percent more 

2901
02:08:57,021 --> 02:08:59,460
likely to search for anime than older 
browsers.

2902
02:08:59,570 --> 02:09:01,750
This is what I'm saying.
Whoa.

2903
02:09:01,751 --> 02:09:06,751
You just blew my mind.
So can we see what the other 12 porn 

2904
02:09:06,751 --> 02:09:08,840
categories are?
Above Sol gagging,

2905
02:09:09,530 --> 02:09:11,320
gagging while getting choked,
gagging,

2906
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:13,850
gagging,
pregnant bench gagging,

2907
02:09:14,850 --> 02:09:15,850
gagging,
Gangbang,

2908
02:09:15,851 --> 02:09:16,450
gang.
Oh,

2909
02:09:16,451 --> 02:09:20,860
here we go.
Number one with the fucking bullet,

2910
02:09:21,730 --> 02:09:26,320
lesbian and then teen,
and then let's not brushed past team.

2911
02:09:26,350 --> 02:09:28,630
That's of awful.
That's horrifying.

2912
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:30,960
Your monsters.
I'd rather you watch anime.

2913
02:09:30,980 --> 02:09:32,980
A step.
Mom is MILF.

2914
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:33,860
Wait,
whoa.

2915
02:09:33,980 --> 02:09:35,750
And then squirt.
People are into peeing.

2916
02:09:35,770 --> 02:09:37,410
People are into square.
They liked the squirt.

2917
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:40,540
I think it's anything other than pain.
And then mom was pulling.

2918
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:41,470
It's a mixture.
Well,

2919
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:43,930
I am interested in really coming out of 
your pussy.

2920
02:09:43,931 --> 02:09:45,390
It's p circle.

2921
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:49,660
We're going to circle back and then when
scientists analyze it,

2922
02:09:50,330 --> 02:09:50,920
they go,
well,

2923
02:09:50,921 --> 02:09:55,240
it's not all p were in circle back.
We're going to circle back to that.

2924
02:09:55,520 --> 02:10:00,520
Uh,
so it's interesting to me that step mom 

2925
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:00,520
is above MILF.
Yeah.

2926
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:01,870
It's interesting.
I want,

2927
02:10:01,871 --> 02:10:03,580
I don't want it.
I want a mom.

2928
02:10:03,581 --> 02:10:05,580
I don't want to be.
You want to fuck your dad's wife.

2929
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:10,980
That's what it is.
That is that a weird Freudian penis 

2930
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:10,980
envy.
Envy thing,

2931
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:11,440
number one.
Number one,

2932
02:10:11,441 --> 02:10:12,670
at the bottom,
rather the least.

2933
02:10:12,671 --> 02:10:15,520
His public public is the least search.
Anal is above.

2934
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:19,780
Anal is shockingly low.
I know Ebony Ebony is above black,

2935
02:10:19,810 --> 02:10:22,630
which I think is the district.
I'm so educated people.

2936
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:23,490
Oh wait,
wait.

2937
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:26,710
No one is a million.
What?

2938
02:10:26,810 --> 02:10:27,640
Wait,
why is.

2939
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:30,880
Why is Japanese and Asian?
I know why they're different.

2940
02:10:30,970 --> 02:10:35,970
Kind of.
But do you see how they're different 

2941
02:10:35,970 --> 02:10:35,970
categories?
Asians way down

2942
02:10:35,970 --> 02:10:39,100
low people are way more into Japanese 
and they are specifically Japanese.

2943
02:10:39,680 --> 02:10:42,140
Asian.
You get like Vietnamese,

2944
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:43,790
Thai and people are like,
nope.

2945
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:44,350
Nope,
nope,

2946
02:10:44,351 --> 02:10:45,620
nope.
Don't draw the line.

2947
02:10:45,650 --> 02:10:48,190
I want to a girl with the Komono.
Yeah.

2948
02:10:48,290 --> 02:10:49,310
Geisha girl.
Oh,

2949
02:10:49,311 --> 02:10:50,820
interesting.
So it's like a power thing.

2950
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:54,770
Yeah,
but I think anything I say here is going

2951
02:10:54,771 --> 02:10:58,430
to be misconstrued as not racist.
Don't be worried about that.

2952
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:00,940
This is the age we live in.
Okay.

2953
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:02,570
At what is the difference where you have
an even black.

2954
02:11:02,571 --> 02:11:03,890
I'm so sorry.
There is no difference.

2955
02:11:03,891 --> 02:11:05,690
One of them has said by people with 
education.

2956
02:11:05,790 --> 02:11:10,790
Got It.
And the other one is someone who just 

2957
02:11:10,790 --> 02:11:12,220
wants to get on a mess,
but I'd imagine what's under those one's

2958
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:17,280
going to be classier than the other.
Maybe there's something socio lineals 

2959
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:17,930
search term differences.
Look at this.

2960
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:19,370
Cosplay.
It's cosplay.

2961
02:11:19,371 --> 02:11:20,060
Sorry.
I don't know.

2962
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:23,440
Search coming or shitting costumes.

2963
02:11:28,740 --> 02:11:33,260
Shit.
Why would you.

2964
02:11:33,980 --> 02:11:36,980
Why would you think cosplay as toilet?
I don't know,

2965
02:11:36,981 --> 02:11:40,280
but I said it so nonchalantly put job.
Look at that.

2966
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:43,220
What is the foot fetish thing?
Can you know?

2967
02:11:43,850 --> 02:11:46,130
I guess it's like something happening 
when you were young.

2968
02:11:46,460 --> 02:11:47,610
Oh,
like some sort of a.

2969
02:11:47,670 --> 02:11:49,660
isn't that called Texas?
Oh,

2970
02:11:49,661 --> 02:11:52,760
my thing is called imprinting sexual 
imprinting.

2971
02:11:53,230 --> 02:11:54,800
That Yoga.
Let me see.

2972
02:11:55,350 --> 02:11:58,730
Yoga is in there right below the yoga 
balls and porn these days.

2973
02:11:58,731 --> 02:12:02,210
I see a lot of sex on yoga balls.
I do not feel sexy,

2974
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:04,880
but Jim is above yoga,
which is interesting.

2975
02:12:04,890 --> 02:12:08,010
More fit.
More people couldn't relate.

2976
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:13,020
Like girl doing squats.
What if she just wanted to fuck right 

2977
02:12:13,020 --> 02:12:13,100
now,
that duke people.

2978
02:12:13,310 --> 02:12:13,840
I'm watching.

2979
02:12:15,850 --> 02:12:19,810
What's a pov now that I heard that porn 
star in La fitness.

2980
02:12:19,820 --> 02:12:22,880
I get the gym porn.
What is emo?

2981
02:12:24,290 --> 02:12:29,290
Goth girls to Morrissey really?
Tattoos now.

2982
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:34,730
I mean that's part of suicide girl type 
girl.

2983
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,350
Suicide girl.
Emo.

2984
02:12:36,390 --> 02:12:38,240
No.
Know what it is.

2985
02:12:38,241 --> 02:12:39,710
Yeah,
sure.

2986
02:12:39,930 --> 02:12:42,750
I mean that's what they are.
Why they call it emo though.

2987
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:45,240
Suicide girl generality.
I would think.

2988
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:47,230
Emo.
A bunch of marches.

2989
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:50,180
Put suicide on here.
Then you're looking for suicide port and

2990
02:12:50,181 --> 02:12:54,560
that's a way different thing than corn.
That's just a crime.

2991
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:57,830
What's that guy who committed suicide?
Elliot something or another.

2992
02:12:58,170 --> 02:13:00,050
What?
Elliot Smith is that his name?

2993
02:13:00,740 --> 02:13:03,050
Duncan told me to listen to them.
I listened to him like,

2994
02:13:03,070 --> 02:13:05,240
Duncan,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

2995
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:08,110
It was like super depressing music and 
like,

2996
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:10,460
no wonder this guy stabbed himself.
Wait,

2997
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:13,940
can you walk me through this?
So what does dogging does?

2998
02:13:14,690 --> 02:13:18,110
Dogging or walking,
but says dogging dogging.

2999
02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:21,500
What the fuck is that?
Long nipples is at the very bottom.

3000
02:13:22,940 --> 02:13:26,150
Granny is well above long nipples.
Wait,

3001
02:13:26,151 --> 02:13:30,110
so synonymous Harry smoking with 
smoking.

3002
02:13:30,111 --> 02:13:33,570
Where does that wife shockingly low.
Why is it negative?

3003
02:13:33,571 --> 02:13:36,960
Does this mean it's become less popular?
This one is actually a comparing.

3004
02:13:36,961 --> 02:13:38,880
Millennials searches to people older 
than them.

3005
02:13:38,881 --> 02:13:42,510
This is millennials.
Are more into all this,

3006
02:13:42,690 --> 02:13:47,690
but this stuff is all new.
Millennials never probably had the 

3007
02:13:47,690 --> 02:13:49,230
opportunity to see granny,
granny porn.

3008
02:13:49,231 --> 02:13:51,360
That's more prevalent now than ever 
before.

3009
02:13:51,361 --> 02:13:54,540
What if you were a grant?
What if you were 80 doing porn?

3010
02:13:54,570 --> 02:13:56,160
What does that.
What is that?

3011
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:57,130
That's a pitch that.
No,

3012
02:13:57,131 --> 02:14:02,131
she's going to die.
Just wants a rod up boat right into the 

3013
02:14:02,131 --> 02:14:02,131
rocks.
Hit the throttle.

3014
02:14:06,430 --> 02:14:08,050
She's bobbing across the top of the 
ocean.

3015
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:12,240
She sees the rocks.
She doesn't let up at all,

3016
02:14:12,380 --> 02:14:14,700
which isn't even close her eyes.
This is upsetting.

3017
02:14:15,460 --> 02:14:17,550
Go back up.
Stop scrolling so much for them.

3018
02:14:17,630 --> 02:14:19,370
No two categories.
Kim Kim.

3019
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:22,210
Kim Kardashian is the most popular porn 
star.

3020
02:14:22,211 --> 02:14:24,290
Searched by millennials.
Porn Star.

3021
02:14:24,590 --> 02:14:26,370
She's got a porn tape.
Oh,

3022
02:14:26,371 --> 02:14:28,830
that's amazing.
I know the rest of the Khalifa.

3023
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:30,130
Who's like a,
uh,

3024
02:14:30,150 --> 02:14:33,080
she's A.
I don't.

3025
02:14:33,950 --> 02:14:36,700
No nothing.
Lisa Ann,

3026
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:41,190
who's deep in her forties,
I believe her victory.

3027
02:14:41,250 --> 02:14:43,410
Interesting.
I don't know any of these people.

3028
02:14:43,450 --> 02:14:44,670
Sasha Gray.
I feel like she.

3029
02:14:44,671 --> 02:14:47,310
She's fallen off the.
I don't think she doesn't anymore.

3030
02:14:47,810 --> 02:14:49,860
She something.
She retired her vagina.

3031
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,180
Throw in the towel.
Yeah.

3032
02:14:51,181 --> 02:14:54,060
You mean it's like a fighter,
they get enough head shots and I'm like,

3033
02:14:54,061 --> 02:14:59,061
I gotta I gotTa step away.
I said enough concussions in the back 

3034
02:14:59,061 --> 02:15:00,850
row.
I don't know.

3035
02:15:00,870 --> 02:15:04,200
I mean I know I met like I did a job 
that does sound crazy,

3036
02:15:04,201 --> 02:15:09,201
so I hired Jenna Jamison to do something
in a pilot that I did and I met her 

3037
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:12,750
fiance and she was actually really cool.

3038
02:15:12,750 --> 02:15:17,750
Like I like that the all the weird,
like recently her twitter feed has 

3039
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:21,771
revealed something else,
but when I met her she seemed quite 

3040
02:15:21,771 --> 02:15:26,091
normal,
whatever that even means and her sober 

3041
02:15:26,091 --> 02:15:28,720
now,
her guy had not,

3042
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:32,760
didn't know she was Jenna Jamison for 
like a couple months.

3043
02:15:33,910 --> 02:15:36,800
I do not believe it.
I know her.

3044
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:41,810
She's a very nice person.
I'd rather not comment on her personal 

3045
02:15:41,810 --> 02:15:41,810
lifestyle.
I don't really know.

3046
02:15:41,810 --> 02:15:43,530
I support anyone who's trying to escape 
that world.

3047
02:15:43,590 --> 02:15:46,620
I'm just wondering if.
Because I also with guys that I date,

3048
02:15:46,650 --> 02:15:48,750
like I never want them to see my 
standup.

3049
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:51,060
Do you think that.
How many guys have you dated?

3050
02:15:51,061 --> 02:15:56,061
Were you were on a date with them for 
awhile before they figured out that you 

3051
02:15:56,061 --> 02:15:56,880
were a famous comedian?
I mean,

3052
02:15:56,881 --> 02:15:58,440
since I've done standup,
I don't.

3053
02:15:58,710 --> 02:15:59,520
Never.
Yeah,

3054
02:15:59,550 --> 02:16:00,140
maybe.
No,

3055
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:01,710
it was always the elephant in the room.

3056
02:16:02,430 --> 02:16:03,630
Well,
it's always like,

3057
02:16:03,631 --> 02:16:06,390
have you seen my specialist?
Have you not?

3058
02:16:06,690 --> 02:16:09,000
And someone I'm seeing now,
I was like,

3059
02:16:09,001 --> 02:16:14,001
could you not if you watch them,
just just so that you have an 

3060
02:16:14,001 --> 02:16:18,621
opportunity to just get to know me first
before you hear me talking about for 40 

3061
02:16:18,621 --> 02:16:18,621
minutes.
He was like,

3062
02:16:18,621 --> 02:16:19,680
I'd rather not actually.
And I'm like,

3063
02:16:19,730 --> 02:16:21,420
cool.
Whereas some guys,

3064
02:16:21,421 --> 02:16:23,640
look what's your specialists note book 
and squirting.

3065
02:16:23,641 --> 02:16:24,270
And I'm like,
okay,

3066
02:16:24,890 --> 02:16:26,010
it's,
I don't want.

3067
02:16:26,700 --> 02:16:29,410
I don't want the guys I date to see me 
that way.

3068
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:30,970
So I would.
I'm just,

3069
02:16:31,060 --> 02:16:33,370
I'm just codependently worried about 
Sasha grace future.

3070
02:16:33,730 --> 02:16:36,010
Wow.
She seems like a very smart person.

3071
02:16:36,270 --> 02:16:36,910
Really?
Yeah.

3072
02:16:37,030 --> 02:16:42,030
A buddy of mine,
you still work for the flashlight and 

3073
02:16:42,030 --> 02:16:43,720
he'd met her and she reads books a lot 
and she's very smart.

3074
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:46,990
Just freak.
She did a whole article about that,

3075
02:16:46,991 --> 02:16:51,991
like she had done some mainstream movie,
the girlfriend experience or something.

3076
02:16:53,220 --> 02:16:54,370
Yep.
That's right.

3077
02:16:54,371 --> 02:16:55,250
That's right.
Yeah.

3078
02:16:55,630 --> 02:17:00,630
And you know,
apparently she did some interview about 

3079
02:17:00,630 --> 02:17:00,630
it.
She was like,

3080
02:17:00,630 --> 02:17:02,140
I'm just sort of embracing my inner 
slut.

3081
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:03,460
She's like,
I like it.

3082
02:17:03,461 --> 02:17:08,461
Like,
how come like guys are allowed to do 

3083
02:17:08,461 --> 02:17:08,461
that.

3084
02:17:08,461 --> 02:17:10,970
I have parents and I have,
I don't put it on.

3085
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:12,940
Maybe that's the thing.
Maybe it's the Paris.

3086
02:17:12,950 --> 02:17:14,650
Anything different there or maybe you 
have,

3087
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:17,890
you don't have parents,
you want to punish you or maybe some,

3088
02:17:17,950 --> 02:17:19,960
some women have parents that they want 
to punish,

3089
02:17:20,150 --> 02:17:25,150
want their dad who doesn't talk to them 
ever to see this and realize how bad he 

3090
02:17:25,150 --> 02:17:25,710
fucked up.
Yeah.

3091
02:17:25,810 --> 02:17:26,520
Oh,
interesting.

3092
02:17:26,521 --> 02:17:30,610
It could be an inactive aggression.
I mean,

3093
02:17:30,611 --> 02:17:32,080
there's a lot of people that I would 
like to,

3094
02:17:32,140 --> 02:17:32,890
uh,
uh,

3095
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:38,000
punished,
get revenge on and I still don't have 

3096
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:38,000
sex on camera and upload it to Vimeo.
Well,

3097
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,840
because that's also self punishment in 
some ways.

3098
02:17:40,570 --> 02:17:43,330
You're setting yourself up to massive 
amounts of.

3099
02:17:43,390 --> 02:17:44,530
Yes,
I like,

3100
02:17:44,531 --> 02:17:47,170
I was,
I went just for no good reason.

3101
02:17:47,171 --> 02:17:52,171
I went to Ronda Rousey's instagram page 
other day because she showed up in my 

3102
02:17:52,171 --> 02:17:52,240
feed.

3103
02:17:52,570 --> 02:17:57,570
I went to her page and I looked at some 
of the comments on some of her pictures 

3104
02:17:58,091 --> 02:18:03,091
in the Holy Shit.
Other monsters out there about sexual 

3105
02:18:03,091 --> 02:18:03,091
stuff?
No,

3106
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:05,050
I mean there's.
I'm sure there's some of it was sexual.

3107
02:18:05,051 --> 02:18:07,570
What?
I just thought it was just mean like you

3108
02:18:07,571 --> 02:18:11,380
open yourself up to just being fucking 
people.

3109
02:18:11,740 --> 02:18:13,510
I mean she,
I don't know,

3110
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:16,930
like she I'm sure is doesn't look at 
that or something,

3111
02:18:16,931 --> 02:18:19,980
but whenever I look at it,
I'm out for a couple days.

3112
02:18:19,990 --> 02:18:21,030
I'm,
I can't look at it.

3113
02:18:21,031 --> 02:18:26,031
Yeah.
Apparently they have to keep Donald 

3114
02:18:26,031 --> 02:18:27,990
Trump away from twitter and from 
instagram and the television because 

3115
02:18:27,990 --> 02:18:28,910
there was some thing that we're talking 
about some,

3116
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:31,270
some campaign aid that was like,
you know,

3117
02:18:31,271 --> 02:18:33,250
we,
we have to keep him away.

3118
02:18:33,251 --> 02:18:38,251
You got to keep them distracted.
You've got to keep them away from the 

3119
02:18:38,251 --> 02:18:40,141
television because he becomes fixated 
and just wants to talk about like 

3120
02:18:40,141 --> 02:18:41,110
someone who's doing a Saturday night 
live sketch about them.

3121
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:41,890
Well,
there's,

3122
02:18:41,891 --> 02:18:42,580
I mean there's,
look,

3123
02:18:42,581 --> 02:18:47,581
I don't know enough about politics to 
really talk about it and it really 

3124
02:18:47,581 --> 02:18:48,790
doesn't matter what,
who you are interested,

3125
02:18:48,791 --> 02:18:53,791
not,
but like he shows the signs of a 

3126
02:18:53,791 --> 02:18:54,220
clinical narcissist and whether that's 
good or bad.

3127
02:18:54,221 --> 02:18:56,430
Maybe presidents should be narcissists,
maybe athletes.

3128
02:18:56,510 --> 02:19:01,510
I don't know where that benefits you.
I'm sure there are careers where it 

3129
02:19:01,510 --> 02:19:04,261
does,
but narcissists have that kind of 

3130
02:19:04,261 --> 02:19:07,141
addiction theory is scary for a leader.
It makes sense for an artist or for an 

3131
02:19:07,510 --> 02:19:11,260
athlete that you have to have some sort 
of narcissism to become j.

3132
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:16,260
Lo to.
I'm just say I'm the best in the world 

3133
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:17,110
to be a diva or to be a whatever the 
fuck you are.

3134
02:19:17,650 --> 02:19:22,650
But yeah,
it becomes a real scary thing when it's 

3135
02:19:22,650 --> 02:19:22,650
like.
I remember,

3136
02:19:22,650 --> 02:19:23,950
um,
when he was talking about Kanye West,

3137
02:19:23,951 --> 02:19:26,920
when Kanye West did that thing in front 
of this giant concert and he said,

3138
02:19:26,921 --> 02:19:28,850
I didn't vote,
that if I did vote I would vote.

3139
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:30,290
He said,
I vote on trump,

3140
02:19:30,650 --> 02:19:34,190
which just didn't seem like it doesn't 
even have a vote on trump.

3141
02:19:34,191 --> 02:19:34,560
Like,
what?

3142
02:19:36,390 --> 02:19:38,520
Thank God you don't vote.
But helping.

3143
02:19:39,980 --> 02:19:44,980
Well it is interesting,
like I was gonna say is he did this 

3144
02:19:44,980 --> 02:19:48,911
thing where he's talking about it in 
front of this gigantic group of people 

3145
02:19:48,911 --> 02:19:49,370
where he's talking about he loves trump.
He loves.

3146
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:54,380
I love Kanye because Kanye loves trump 
and he was talking about himself in 

3147
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:58,090
third person.
It was so disturbing and it's like this 

3148
02:19:58,090 --> 02:20:00,230
is such a weird way of addressing that 
instead of saying in a gracious way.

3149
02:20:00,231 --> 02:20:02,180
That was very kind of him.
I appreciate him.

3150
02:20:02,181 --> 02:20:05,060
He's a brilliant artist and it's very 
nice to have a support.

3151
02:20:05,061 --> 02:20:05,750
Thank you.
Kanye.

3152
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:07,730
Instead of just saying that he loves 
trump.

3153
02:20:07,850 --> 02:20:09,810
Well he loved what I love Kanye because 
Kanye live.

3154
02:20:09,870 --> 02:20:11,030
Trump,
he loves trump.

3155
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:12,850
Like he kept saying it and repeating.

3156
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:16,820
It broke like an Asian person speaking 
broken English.

3157
02:20:16,821 --> 02:20:21,821
He's also a 70 year old grandpa who's 
out there working 150 hours a day and 

3158
02:20:21,891 --> 02:20:25,100
he's probably ragged.
But your thing about impulse control,

3159
02:20:25,290 --> 02:20:27,560
it's like if you can't go,
you're not going to send that.

3160
02:20:28,450 --> 02:20:33,450
I'm going to put a pin in that and spend
some time critical thinking before I 

3161
02:20:33,450 --> 02:20:37,810
sort of act.
But this is also a man who did you hear 

3162
02:20:37,810 --> 02:20:37,810
what he said?
Um,

3163
02:20:37,810 --> 02:20:38,510
he was like,
you know,

3164
02:20:38,511 --> 02:20:40,640
I,
I can see things from every angle.

3165
02:20:40,641 --> 02:20:42,070
I'm not doing impressions.
Uh,

3166
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:44,540
I can see things from every angle 
probably better than anyone.

3167
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:45,440
Yeah.
Well,

3168
02:20:45,441 --> 02:20:48,900
he always does.
Anyone you know.

3169
02:20:48,980 --> 02:20:52,550
But I'm fascinated by how much a mental 
illness can help you.

3170
02:20:52,551 --> 02:20:54,290
And then when it starts to backfire on 
you,

3171
02:20:54,330 --> 02:20:59,330
you know,
it's obviously worked pretty well on 

3172
02:20:59,330 --> 02:20:59,330
some level.
Well,

3173
02:20:59,330 --> 02:21:00,620
what's going on now is his mental state 
or his,

3174
02:21:00,621 --> 02:21:03,920
the way he behaves,
his personality is being examined by the

3175
02:21:03,921 --> 02:21:08,450
brightest minds in the world in a very 
brutal about us.

3176
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:12,320
Other people that are the dumbest 
idiots.

3177
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:16,070
So let's talk about comics and gagging 
for watching,

3178
02:21:16,071 --> 02:21:18,830
zip popping,
but he's,

3179
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:20,720
you know,
he's under this.

3180
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:25,750
There's a level of scrutiny that you get
if you're a rapper like Kanye west or a 

3181
02:21:25,750 --> 02:21:29,510
fighter like Rhonda Rousey.
And then there's this whole nother level

3182
02:21:29,511 --> 02:21:34,511
when you want to be the center of the 
entire nuclear armament for the United 

3183
02:21:36,110 --> 02:21:41,110
States of America.
You want to be the commander in chief 

3184
02:21:41,110 --> 02:21:41,110
for the greatest country.
The world has ever known and that's what

3185
02:21:41,110 --> 02:21:41,270
he's.
He's done.

3186
02:21:41,290 --> 02:21:43,040
He's,
and I don't think it's good.

3187
02:21:43,070 --> 02:21:47,390
I don't know how it's was talking about 
this and I think Howard knows him pretty

3188
02:21:47,391 --> 02:21:52,391
well.
I think it was very astute what he was 

3189
02:21:52,391 --> 02:21:52,391
saying.
It's like it's not good for him.

3190
02:21:52,391 --> 02:21:56,650
Like mentally,
it's like the guy wants to be loved and 

3191
02:21:56,650 --> 02:21:56,650
you're just not going to be loved in 
that job.

3192
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:58,190
Nobody.
Nobody gets loved.

3193
02:21:58,220 --> 02:22:03,220
Yeah,
you did it to get love and you're 

3194
02:22:03,220 --> 02:22:03,220
getting the massive amount of hate come 
at you.

3195
02:22:03,220 --> 02:22:04,300
But he is getting love from a specific 
area.

3196
02:22:04,310 --> 02:22:09,310
People.
I mean I'm again fascinated by the 

3197
02:22:09,310 --> 02:22:09,310
primal element of it,
of how we,

3198
02:22:09,310 --> 02:22:13,900
you know,
the people are who are responding well 

3199
02:22:13,900 --> 02:22:15,500
to what he's doing are responding to 
Alpha and we have a,

3200
02:22:15,530 --> 02:22:18,140
I think reptilian attraction to Alpha 
males.

3201
02:22:18,141 --> 02:22:23,141
I mean,
I'll say it when I was watching him in 

3202
02:22:23,141 --> 02:22:25,240
early,
early on and that in the early debates 

3203
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:25,240
when there was like six candidates on 
stage,

3204
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:26,010
as much as.
I mean I did his

3205
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,240
roast,
I met him.

3206
02:22:27,241 --> 02:22:28,620
He was gross to me.
Like,

3207
02:22:29,020 --> 02:22:30,070
yeah,
oh he's,

3208
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:35,300
he's,
he's the guy who puts his hand on your 

3209
02:22:35,300 --> 02:22:35,300
lower back when he talks to you for no 
reason at all.

3210
02:22:35,340 --> 02:22:36,720
Like it was just like,
you know,

3211
02:22:36,721 --> 02:22:38,490
but he's,
he's a car.

3212
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:40,980
Was a cartoon character of Donald Trump.
I mean,

3213
02:22:40,981 --> 02:22:43,410
it's like he's the earth dots version of
Donald Trump.

3214
02:22:43,710 --> 02:22:46,310
It's so surreal at this point.
Uh,

3215
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:50,640
but I saw him sort of knowing all of his
shortcomings this before anyone actually

3216
02:22:50,641 --> 02:22:52,860
thought he would become president.
He,

3217
02:22:52,861 --> 02:22:54,990
I'm not that the other candidates didn't
have shortcomings,

3218
02:22:55,740 --> 02:23:00,740
but he said to all of the people,
he pointed them all out and he was like,

3219
02:23:00,781 --> 02:23:03,060
you've asked me for money,
you've asked me for money.

3220
02:23:03,061 --> 02:23:07,620
You Bet.
And it was so ballsy and courageous.

3221
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:09,860
And I was like,
my primal brain was like,

3222
02:23:09,870 --> 02:23:10,990
if there's an earthquake,
I'm,

3223
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:16,120
I'm going with that guy.
I think we're all in such a survivalist 

3224
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:18,080
mindset with what's happened with the 
economy and people are struggling for.

3225
02:23:18,100 --> 02:23:19,080
I get it,
you know?

3226
02:23:19,410 --> 02:23:20,520
And I was like,
Yep,

3227
02:23:20,910 --> 02:23:23,220
that guy's the most fearless 
motherfucker have the budge.

3228
02:23:23,221 --> 02:23:26,090
Everybody is so calculated and scared 
and reserved.

3229
02:23:26,490 --> 02:23:28,100
They weren't prepared for that.
There's,

3230
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:31,350
I don't think politics in general was 
prepared for someone with that mindset.

3231
02:23:31,351 --> 02:23:34,890
Someone who can rebound from that,
grab the pussy thing and be like,

3232
02:23:34,891 --> 02:23:36,510
it was locker room talk.
He didn't care.

3233
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:38,610
If he apologized,
we would have been pissed.

3234
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:40,340
I mean,
I mean at least to support this would've

3235
02:23:40,360 --> 02:23:41,270
been pissed.
He didn't apologize.

3236
02:23:41,271 --> 02:23:41,990
So yeah,
I said it.

3237
02:23:42,530 --> 02:23:44,840
There's something in our primal brains 
that's like,

3238
02:23:44,841 --> 02:23:49,841
yes,
that guy can protect me when shit goes 

3239
02:23:49,841 --> 02:23:49,841
down.

3240
02:23:49,841 --> 02:23:52,580
Well there's also like people are tired 
of really ultra left wing nanny state 

3241
02:23:54,961 --> 02:23:59,961
type people to want to tell you what you
can say and what you can say to behave 

3242
02:23:59,961 --> 02:24:01,290
and totally trigger word

3243
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:04,080
and you're so good at like you're not 
contributing to this problem.

3244
02:24:04,081 --> 02:24:09,081
You're part of this solution of.
I think there's also like we were 

3245
02:24:09,081 --> 02:24:09,090
talking about earlier with Catholic 
schools in the pendulum swinging of this

3246
02:24:09,091 --> 02:24:13,280
like hyper political correctness and 
then just this reaction of like,

3247
02:24:13,290 --> 02:24:18,290
this motherfucker does not care.
He's saying Muslims are bad and they're 

3248
02:24:18,290 --> 02:24:21,710
raped,
but like he's saying what our crazy 

3249
02:24:21,710 --> 02:24:21,710
uncle says at dinner every night,
you know,

3250
02:24:21,710 --> 02:24:23,190
and like there's just something brave

3251
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:28,270
about it that's attractive to people.
I think there is hope that someone is 

3252
02:24:28,270 --> 02:24:32,621
going to recognize the positive elements
of that kind of not total disregard for 

3253
02:24:33,950 --> 02:24:35,990
the way people view him,
but,

3254
02:24:36,290 --> 02:24:41,290
but having the confidence to be yourself
and then meeting much closer to the 

3255
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:47,080
middle in terms of being compassionate 
and kind and being open minded and 

3256
02:24:47,080 --> 02:24:48,620
instead of apologetic and weekend scare.
Exactly.

3257
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:49,940
Thank you.
Can Be both.

3258
02:24:49,970 --> 02:24:54,970
You know,
and the other part of the Democratic 

3259
02:24:54,970 --> 02:24:54,970
Party is showing a,
a,

3260
02:24:54,970 --> 02:24:59,520
a lack of people who are unapologetic 
fearless and um,

3261
02:25:01,430 --> 02:25:02,420
have a plum.

3262
02:25:03,050 --> 02:25:04,040
Yeah.
This also,

3263
02:25:04,370 --> 02:25:09,370
there's,
it's interesting watching people that 

3264
02:25:09,370 --> 02:25:09,680
he's trying to assign a different 
cabinet positions backing out.

3265
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:10,670
They're like,
nope,

3266
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:15,920
sorry.
No amount of money can deal with the 

3267
02:25:15,920 --> 02:25:16,880
hate frats and the pussy hats out my 
front door.

3268
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:21,680
It's so detrimental to your career.
And if they think the boat is sinking,

3269
02:25:21,681 --> 02:25:22,040
like,
oh,

3270
02:25:22,041 --> 02:25:24,070
this might make it the ocean.
But

3271
02:25:25,070 --> 02:25:26,680
I could also just.
Yeah,

3272
02:25:26,681 --> 02:25:28,600
it's,
it's a fascinating time,

3273
02:25:28,601 --> 02:25:33,601
I think,
to explore the kind of things that you 

3274
02:25:33,601 --> 02:25:33,601
explore in your show,
which is human nature and our primordial

3275
02:25:33,601 --> 02:25:35,260
instincts because this is,
has been,

3276
02:25:35,261 --> 02:25:38,230
I think,
the most tribal primal thing I've,

3277
02:25:38,290 --> 02:25:39,760
I've witnessed in my lifetime.

3278
02:25:39,910 --> 02:25:43,330
I've never seen so much separation 
between the left and the right and the,

3279
02:25:43,331 --> 02:25:46,090
the anger and fury that's going on 
today.

3280
02:25:46,360 --> 02:25:49,330
A great article in,
I think it was scientific American.

3281
02:25:49,331 --> 02:25:54,331
I think about when people are wrong 
about something because here's the other

3282
02:25:54,761 --> 02:25:59,761
thing,
like even if you voted for trump and he 

3283
02:25:59,761 --> 02:25:59,761
promised you,
you know,

3284
02:25:59,761 --> 02:26:00,910
manufacturing jobs will come back,
which is kind of impossible given modern

3285
02:26:00,911 --> 02:26:03,250
technology.
He promised something that is sorta like

3286
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:06,580
technologically not a feasible.
But um,

3287
02:26:07,120 --> 02:26:09,370
even if,
if when you voted for him,

3288
02:26:09,430 --> 02:26:12,820
you were right to,
he was going to give you.

3289
02:26:12,821 --> 02:26:15,160
He said Isis in 30 days,
it's been more than 30 days,

3290
02:26:15,161 --> 02:26:15,890
hasn't done.
You know,

3291
02:26:17,220 --> 02:26:18,630
when people say,
you know,

3292
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:20,860
I was wrong,
that guy fucking lied to me.

3293
02:26:20,861 --> 02:26:23,320
It's so hard for us to do that because 
of our ego.

3294
02:26:23,321 --> 02:26:25,960
And there was an article in scientific 
American help people in Grand,

3295
02:26:25,961 --> 02:26:30,961
I'm sure this study was skewed and it's 
a specific group of people that sign up 

3296
02:26:31,331 --> 02:26:33,760
for a study,
but that when someone was wrong,

3297
02:26:34,180 --> 02:26:39,180
when someone told them they were wrong,
it made them believe their point even 

3298
02:26:39,180 --> 02:26:39,180
more.

3299
02:26:39,180 --> 02:26:41,290
I don't know,
there's the article I'll send,

3300
02:26:41,390 --> 02:26:43,900
I'll send it to you or are they doubled 
down?

3301
02:26:44,260 --> 02:26:46,040
But if you say to them,
uh,

3302
02:26:46,060 --> 02:26:51,060
and I think that it's the CIA that uses 
this as a form of questioning is that 

3303
02:26:51,060 --> 02:26:54,391
you first have to legitimize their 
position before you suggest that there 

3304
02:26:54,391 --> 02:26:54,391
might be something flawed about it.
So you go like,

3305
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:59,760
you know,
I totally understand that you would 

3306
02:26:59,760 --> 02:26:59,760
think that,
you know,

3307
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:00,100
the earth is flat.
I can see why you would thought that.

3308
02:27:00,101 --> 02:27:01,000
I mean,
you grew up here.

3309
02:27:01,001 --> 02:27:04,210
Of course you thought that if you 
empathize with them first and then say,

3310
02:27:04,290 --> 02:27:06,250
know,
but turns out it's round.

3311
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:09,820
They'll more,
they're more likely to come around.

3312
02:27:09,821 --> 02:27:10,450
But if you just say,
hey,

3313
02:27:10,451 --> 02:27:11,410
you know,
that's fucking wrong.

3314
02:27:11,650 --> 02:27:15,450
And if you show them proof,
they doubled down even further on there.

3315
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:17,260
What's the worst thing you say to 
someone's upset?

3316
02:27:17,261 --> 02:27:18,970
Calm down.
Relax.

3317
02:27:19,380 --> 02:27:21,320
They just get fucking furious.
Yeah,

3318
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:25,070
it's a non.
It's a non respecting thing.

3319
02:27:25,071 --> 02:27:26,960
You're not respecting the person's state
of mind.

3320
02:27:27,240 --> 02:27:30,200
You're not,
you're not objectively stepping back and

3321
02:27:30,201 --> 02:27:35,201
looking,
how does this person really feel right 

3322
02:27:35,201 --> 02:27:35,201
now and what's the best one?

3323
02:27:35,201 --> 02:27:35,201
You're a demoralizing and what we're all
doing is demoralizing each other,

3324
02:27:35,201 --> 02:27:35,880
but going,
you're fucking wrong.

3325
02:27:35,881 --> 02:27:40,881
You're stupid.
And something that was interesting just 

3326
02:27:40,881 --> 02:27:43,701
from an I know that I am in Hollywood 
and I don't know anything about 

3327
02:27:43,701 --> 02:27:43,701
politics.
I know you don't have to tweet it.

3328
02:27:43,701 --> 02:27:46,770
I know,
but one thing I do know is that,

3329
02:27:46,830 --> 02:27:51,830
um,
and I was sort of fascinated by the 

3330
02:27:51,830 --> 02:27:53,250
comedians role in,
in this election because as the dino 

3331
02:27:53,250 --> 02:27:57,660
news fails us in a lot of ways,
a comedians sometimes tend to sort of 

3332
02:27:57,660 --> 02:27:57,660
show up and,
and,

3333
02:27:57,660 --> 02:28:00,300
and tell the truth.
But I'm in every movie.

3334
02:28:00,390 --> 02:28:03,210
The underdog always has to win and 
right.

3335
02:28:03,211 --> 02:28:06,860
It's just really fucking baseball,
I'm sure.

3336
02:28:06,870 --> 02:28:08,610
What is the field of dreams?
Rocky?

3337
02:28:08,611 --> 02:28:10,590
Exactly.
So I was like,

3338
02:28:10,650 --> 02:28:15,650
everybody beating up on him and you're 
just making him the underdog and 

3339
02:28:15,650 --> 02:28:17,250
underdogs always have to win.
It's just like some weird human nature,

3340
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:18,870
destiny.
Also the president,

3341
02:28:18,871 --> 02:28:21,930
like you can't really be the underdog 
and be the Kenya anything.

3342
02:28:21,990 --> 02:28:26,990
He was an underdog.
I think during the election we were 

3343
02:28:26,990 --> 02:28:26,990
beating up on him and I think we were 
going q stupid,

3344
02:28:26,990 --> 02:28:28,190
you're dumb,
you're not qualified.

3345
02:28:28,191 --> 02:28:28,970
And then everyone was like,
oh,

3346
02:28:28,971 --> 02:28:31,160
we gotta fucking root for that guy 
because we were,

3347
02:28:31,250 --> 02:28:36,250
you know,
I just going to take the establishment 

3348
02:28:36,250 --> 02:28:36,250
down.
But meanwhile he's bringing in all these

3349
02:28:36,250 --> 02:28:37,210
fucking bank.
Yeah.

3350
02:28:37,420 --> 02:28:42,420
And people tweeting about them just gave
them hundreds of millions of dollars of 

3351
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:44,921
free press.
It was just sort of interesting how we 

3352
02:28:44,921 --> 02:28:45,500
sort of hoodwinked ourselves and just 
tweeting about them.

3353
02:28:45,501 --> 02:28:50,501
The things that he said were the things 
that CNN decided they were going to 

3354
02:28:50,501 --> 02:28:53,261
cover and now he won't let CNN into the 
press or the New York Times wouldn't let

3355
02:28:53,691 --> 02:28:58,691
the New York Times the press gaggle.
But he let info wars and all these other

3356
02:28:59,390 --> 02:29:02,290
weird websites.
And I mean it's,

3357
02:29:02,291 --> 02:29:04,100
it's very,
it's very odd.

3358
02:29:04,130 --> 02:29:06,620
It's like that's unprecedented that 
he's,

3359
02:29:06,890 --> 02:29:11,420
he's limiting access to the press.

3360
02:29:11,530 --> 02:29:14,490
I mean he filed for reelection five 
hours after he won.

3361
02:29:14,580 --> 02:29:17,090
I mean this guy is like,
you know,

3362
02:29:17,860 --> 02:29:22,860
and there's something amazing about it,
like he has figured out a way to 

3363
02:29:22,860 --> 02:29:27,130
hypnotize a nation or a world.
I mean there's something just so primal 

3364
02:29:27,741 --> 02:29:29,780
at play.
The juke in the system the same way he's

3365
02:29:29,781 --> 02:29:32,700
choked the system with taxes and with,
you know,

3366
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:37,720
with the filing for bankruptcy were 
mostly designed to follow rules and to 

3367
02:29:37,720 --> 02:29:39,080
comply with what is socially acceptable.
Right.

3368
02:29:39,081 --> 02:29:41,020
That's like how we get dopamine.
It's like just fit in,

3369
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:42,920
be part of the pack.
That's how you stay safe.

3370
02:29:42,950 --> 02:29:46,340
And he is not one of those people and 
it's just pretty fascinating what.

3371
02:29:46,341 --> 02:29:48,080
No,
not by any stretch of the imagination.

3372
02:29:48,081 --> 02:29:51,170
It's,
it's unprecedented that this person,

3373
02:29:51,530 --> 02:29:53,840
that the lies all the time.
That's logically,

3374
02:29:54,010 --> 02:29:55,130
pathologically.
Yeah.

3375
02:29:55,180 --> 02:29:55,880
But you.
But,

3376
02:29:55,890 --> 02:30:00,890
but these getting called on it though,
which is weird to see that the reporter 

3377
02:30:00,890 --> 02:30:04,690
who said he said to him,
you said that you won by the largest 

3378
02:30:04,690 --> 02:30:04,760
margin.

3379
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:06,800
It was someone told me that he said,
well,

3380
02:30:06,801 --> 02:30:07,500
he said,
well,

3381
02:30:07,501 --> 02:30:09,620
it was amongst Republicans,
and then he said no,

3382
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:14,000
because George h dot w dot Bush had a 
larger electoral college victory.

3383
02:30:14,010 --> 02:30:15,170
Like,
well what?

3384
02:30:15,230 --> 02:30:16,520
They told him,
what I've been told,

3385
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:19,220
but there's also within,
this is sort of back to the horse thing,

3386
02:30:19,221 --> 02:30:21,650
like it doesn't matter what you say,
it matters how you say it.

3387
02:30:21,800 --> 02:30:24,830
Right,
and do people care if they're being lied

3388
02:30:24,831 --> 02:30:29,831
to,
if they're being lied to in an 

3389
02:30:29,831 --> 02:30:29,831
authoritative way with someone who seems
very confident,

3390
02:30:29,831 --> 02:30:30,590
like they know what they're fucking 
doing,

3391
02:30:30,620 --> 02:30:32,030
what's going to chip away at them 
though?

3392
02:30:32,031 --> 02:30:35,210
This is what I really believe that all 
these times where he's being checked,

3393
02:30:35,610 --> 02:30:40,610
this is the reason why you won't go to 
the White House press correspondents' 

3394
02:30:40,610 --> 02:30:40,990
dinner.
Like that's weird saying,

3395
02:30:42,490 --> 02:30:44,630
well this is member.
When he wouldn't go on the debates,

3396
02:30:44,631 --> 02:30:45,850
he wouldn't go on CNN.

3397
02:30:45,850 --> 02:30:46,370
He,
this happened.

3398
02:30:46,371 --> 02:30:48,580
This has been going on where he just 
refuses to be president.

3399
02:30:48,581 --> 02:30:53,581
I don't Hae,
hasn't not even moved in and he's been 

3400
02:30:53,581 --> 02:30:54,050
golfing most of his presidency and it's 
caused us money.

3401
02:30:54,370 --> 02:30:59,370
No,
he sends his kids on these business 

3402
02:30:59,370 --> 02:31:01,541
trips to go set up hotels and the 
countries that don't have to protect 

3403
02:31:01,541 --> 02:31:04,250
this kid.
I can't tell if people care,

3404
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:06,440
but little known yet.
It's only been.

3405
02:31:06,470 --> 02:31:09,440
It's only been 30 something days.
How long has he been in the White House?

3406
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:11,150
January.
Yeah,

3407
02:31:11,151 --> 02:31:13,340
so he's been in the White House a little
over a month.

3408
02:31:13,360 --> 02:31:18,360
Yeah,
and most people are just living their 

3409
02:31:18,360 --> 02:31:18,910
lives and they're busy and they're busy 
and they just don't even have time while

3410
02:31:18,920 --> 02:31:20,400
for that information to trickle

3411
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:23,370
into the entire country.
Like it's getting into some people.

3412
02:31:23,371 --> 02:31:24,820
There's people that are furious.
There's,

3413
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:30,040
you know,
there's New York Times writers who are 

3414
02:31:30,040 --> 02:31:30,330
writing on on a daily basis and there's 
all these different authors.

3415
02:31:31,040 --> 02:31:36,040
I mean I just think there's something to
be said for and I'm working on this in 

3416
02:31:36,040 --> 02:31:36,040
my life to be able to be like,
I was wrong.

3417
02:31:36,800 --> 02:31:40,050
You got me good,
you hoodwinked me and I'm wrong.

3418
02:31:40,051 --> 02:31:42,000
And now what do you think that people 
are going to do that though?

3419
02:31:42,001 --> 02:31:47,001
Because that's,
that's acquiescing to the left or just 

3420
02:31:47,001 --> 02:31:47,001
act.
I mean,

3421
02:31:47,001 --> 02:31:50,430
or just being sane going like I was,
I was bamboozled and,

3422
02:31:50,460 --> 02:31:55,460
but being seen as not,
that doesn't work when you have these 

3423
02:31:55,460 --> 02:31:56,840
party politics when you're tribal,
tribal,

3424
02:31:57,200 --> 02:32:02,200
so team oriented.
I mean it's just something that's 

3425
02:32:02,200 --> 02:32:04,341
ingrained in us to have an enemy,
an enemy to fight with and then it 

3426
02:32:05,191 --> 02:32:06,450
becomes all about our projections.

3427
02:32:06,460 --> 02:32:07,890
I mean,
it's really been hard because I'm trying

3428
02:32:07,891 --> 02:32:09,720
to sort of like,
especially going on stage,

3429
02:32:09,721 --> 02:32:14,130
like I had a riot breakout and Napa 
people started fighting in a crowd.

3430
02:32:14,390 --> 02:32:15,820
What were you talking about?
And they write it.

3431
02:32:15,930 --> 02:32:18,540
This was before the election and I 
really started out with being like,

3432
02:32:18,541 --> 02:32:18,870
you know,
what,

3433
02:32:18,871 --> 02:32:22,290
politics is not my thing.
There's people who are much better at it

3434
02:32:22,291 --> 02:32:24,390
and I let them do it.
If you want to talk about squirting,

3435
02:32:24,391 --> 02:32:26,450
you come to me.
But like I know my,

3436
02:32:26,490 --> 02:32:31,490
I stay in my lane and.
But this felt like something that was 

3437
02:32:31,490 --> 02:32:31,490
just,
you know,

3438
02:32:31,490 --> 02:32:31,910
beyond,
uh,

3439
02:32:31,980 --> 02:32:36,980
something that was,
it almost feels weird to ignore it on 

3440
02:32:36,980 --> 02:32:36,980
stage.
It's like the elephant linear.

3441
02:32:36,980 --> 02:32:38,250
And so I was talking about it at night.
I was like,

3442
02:32:38,251 --> 02:32:40,320
look,
I'm not saying who I think should win.

3443
02:32:40,380 --> 02:32:41,760
I think both candidates have flaws.

3444
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:44,760
I think there's one that's less flawed,
but whatever.

3445
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:47,850
And I said something about,
you know,

3446
02:32:47,851 --> 02:32:49,950
if bill is in the White House because 
it'd be interested.

3447
02:32:49,980 --> 02:32:51,600
First female president was just 
something about like,

3448
02:32:51,601 --> 02:32:56,601
what happens with the first female 
president now I think that there should 

3449
02:32:56,601 --> 02:32:59,241
be a rule saying that the first female 
male can cheat.

3450
02:32:59,431 --> 02:33:01,860
So because the woman doesn't have,
she doesn't have time to fuck him,

3451
02:33:01,890 --> 02:33:05,280
like she doesn't have time and this 
woman yelled out.

3452
02:33:05,281 --> 02:33:08,910
She was like,
how dare you talk about Hillary?

3453
02:33:09,270 --> 02:33:10,020
Uh,
you know,

3454
02:33:10,021 --> 02:33:12,240
this is one of the most conservative 
areas in the country.

3455
02:33:12,241 --> 02:33:17,241
You need to know your audience.
This lady said that she was in the 

3456
02:33:17,241 --> 02:33:17,340
second row.
She was with me the entire time.

3457
02:33:17,850 --> 02:33:22,850
Turns on me and I was like,
and I just know your audience like I now

3458
02:33:25,081 --> 02:33:26,790
I realized wrongly was like,
oh no,

3459
02:33:26,791 --> 02:33:27,930
you need to know your comedian.

3460
02:33:27,930 --> 02:33:31,020
I don't give a shit.
And that was a bad.

3461
02:33:31,170 --> 02:33:32,760
Well I,
well I,

3462
02:33:33,110 --> 02:33:38,110
I thought so.
But then the audience all went after her

3463
02:33:38,551 --> 02:33:43,551
and then her,
she had like a bunch of people with her 

3464
02:33:43,551 --> 02:33:43,551
and it was just turned into like a 
Malay.

3465
02:33:43,551 --> 02:33:44,360
Like it was awesome.
It was,

3466
02:33:45,030 --> 02:33:46,800
you would have loved it.
I was here in Napa.

3467
02:33:46,801 --> 02:33:51,801
They're probably drunk as shit faced.
I was so scared and because it was not,

3468
02:33:52,860 --> 02:33:54,450
no one was tractable.
It wasn't like,

3469
02:33:54,510 --> 02:33:55,450
oh,
the bodyguard,

3470
02:33:55,500 --> 02:33:57,720
it was like everybody was getting up and
fighting with everybody.

3471
02:33:57,930 --> 02:33:58,870
And so,
uh,

3472
02:33:58,950 --> 02:34:00,570
I hadn't really talked about on stage,
but it just,

3473
02:34:00,571 --> 02:34:02,280
so it's,
it's just so deep.

3474
02:34:02,281 --> 02:34:05,460
It's so visceral with people.
It's like we're in war.

3475
02:34:05,461 --> 02:34:07,380
I mean this country's in a psychological
war,

3476
02:34:07,460 --> 02:34:12,460
psychological,
civil war and I can't and you can't 

3477
02:34:12,460 --> 02:34:12,460
bring it up with anybody.
It just is like,

3478
02:34:12,460 --> 02:34:17,390
I feel like I'm walking on eggshells 
around it and this is the first time I 

3479
02:34:17,390 --> 02:34:17,390
think I've ever even talked about.

3480
02:34:17,390 --> 02:34:17,390
I don't even tweet about it.
I just kind of like,

3481
02:34:17,510 --> 02:34:19,000
um,
how did the show end?

3482
02:34:19,640 --> 02:34:23,710
Fire quickly earthquake.
I got my check and it cleared.

3483
02:34:23,770 --> 02:34:24,790
Um,
but no,

3484
02:34:24,791 --> 02:34:29,791
they had to be like 16 people had to be 
removed when the show went on and I 

3485
02:34:33,731 --> 02:34:35,800
ended up,
I mean for me,

3486
02:34:35,801 --> 02:34:40,801
like if someone tells me I just had to,
so I had to go harder at the political 

3487
02:34:40,801 --> 02:34:44,551
thing and it was,
but it's kind of thing where I thrive 

3488
02:34:44,551 --> 02:34:44,740
and adrenaline and conflict.
I was just like,

3489
02:34:44,741 --> 02:34:46,240
bitches,
this is how I grew up.

3490
02:34:46,241 --> 02:34:49,090
Like don't,
don't clucking I'm looking for an excuse

3491
02:34:49,091 --> 02:34:50,740
to fight people,
like don't do this,

3492
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:55,980
don't you think you also have being fun,
starting out and doing a lot of work 

3493
02:34:55,980 --> 02:34:58,500
rather at the comedy store,
like fucking original room comic,

3494
02:34:58,501 --> 02:35:03,501
like you fucked with the wrong monster 
with the idea she could say know your 

3495
02:35:03,501 --> 02:35:07,030
audience the most conservative place in 
the like she was like,

3496
02:35:07,031 --> 02:35:07,930
no,
you're like,

3497
02:35:07,931 --> 02:35:10,840
cater your material to us.

3498
02:35:11,300 --> 02:35:14,590
Which was just so yeah,
she was one of those.

3499
02:35:14,591 --> 02:35:17,650
I mean it was really demeaning and it 
was really.

3500
02:35:17,651 --> 02:35:20,020
And I think I also was like got very 
deeply insulted.

3501
02:35:20,021 --> 02:35:21,160
Like,
you know,

3502
02:35:21,250 --> 02:35:26,250
I was a slot machine that are like a 
jukebox where she puts money in and I'm 

3503
02:35:26,250 --> 02:35:27,820
just supposed to do what she wants me to
do and I was like,

3504
02:35:27,821 --> 02:35:32,821
comedians were the only ones left who 
are taking risks and saying shit that no

3505
02:35:33,761 --> 02:35:36,340
one else will say like,
how dare you.

3506
02:35:36,341 --> 02:35:39,610
Like I felt like it was an attack on 
free speech in general.

3507
02:35:39,611 --> 02:35:44,611
Like,
well people have their ideas of what 

3508
02:35:44,611 --> 02:35:44,611
you're supposed to do,
you know,

3509
02:35:44,611 --> 02:35:45,160
this is how you're supposed to behave if
you're this,

3510
02:35:45,161 --> 02:35:47,320
this is how you're supposed to have a 
bedside manner.

3511
02:35:47,321 --> 02:35:49,210
If you're a doctor,
if you're a comedian,

3512
02:35:49,570 --> 02:35:51,280
you know you have to tailor your jokes.

3513
02:35:51,340 --> 02:35:52,750
I think it's,
I think it's like if you're.

3514
02:35:53,110 --> 02:35:54,080
I mean,
I know for,

3515
02:35:54,081 --> 02:35:59,081
I mean I'm in comedy,
so I think if a comedian doesn't make 

3516
02:35:59,081 --> 02:35:59,081
you a little uncomfortable at some 
point,

3517
02:35:59,081 --> 02:36:00,070
we're kind of not doing our job.
You know?

3518
02:36:00,130 --> 02:36:05,130
I always think it's hilarious and 
someone tells you not to talk about 

3519
02:36:05,130 --> 02:36:05,130
something.
Like someone tells you next subject.

3520
02:36:05,260 --> 02:36:08,050
Have you ever had someone to yell out 
next subject?

3521
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:11,440
Oh my gosh.
I've had some pretty,

3522
02:36:12,670 --> 02:36:15,260
well I've had sometimes I'm Kevin 
Christie,

3523
02:36:15,310 --> 02:36:19,600
a pointed out to me one time that I'm 
about to open for me a long time,

3524
02:36:19,601 --> 02:36:23,020
about 45 minutes into my set,
someone always turns on me.

3525
02:36:24,490 --> 02:36:28,240
It's usually a man who just has had a 
drink and I've turned.

3526
02:36:28,241 --> 02:36:33,241
I turned into their wife,
like a woman talking to a microphone at 

3527
02:36:33,241 --> 02:36:36,031
you for that long.
I will become your mother or your ex 

3528
02:36:36,031 --> 02:36:39,211
wife,
the girl who didn't fucking you in high 

3529
02:36:39,211 --> 02:36:39,211
school.

3530
02:36:39,211 --> 02:36:39,211
Like there's some booze.
The booze.

3531
02:36:39,211 --> 02:36:39,670
Like I just,
I like.

3532
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,340
And one time we were in the Hoya,
which you know,

3533
02:36:42,341 --> 02:36:45,850
is the most just chaotic group of sort 
of drunk people.

3534
02:36:46,230 --> 02:36:51,230
Xanax and yeah.
And I did this joke about like how guys 

3535
02:36:51,230 --> 02:36:51,230
ages ago.
Um,

3536
02:36:51,230 --> 02:36:51,460
they,
uh,

3537
02:36:51,970 --> 02:36:52,620
they,
um,

3538
02:36:53,080 --> 02:36:58,080
they have,
every guy is like a jar of coins in 

3539
02:36:58,080 --> 02:36:58,080
their house somewhere,
like,

3540
02:36:58,080 --> 02:36:58,900
like pennies,
like it's like a,

3541
02:36:58,990 --> 02:37:03,630
it's like a or like a bowl of coins and 
uh,

3542
02:37:03,820 --> 02:37:06,430
everyone's laughing and blah blah.
And this guy just snaps at me.

3543
02:37:06,431 --> 02:37:09,010
He had been in the front row laughing 
the entire time and he was just like,

3544
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:14,280
that's so we can pay for a year and a 
very quickly I realized

3545
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:21,190
that I had transmogrified into someone 
and uh,

3546
02:37:22,250 --> 02:37:27,250
so it's triggering,
I mean going into see comedy can be 

3547
02:37:27,250 --> 02:37:27,250
triggering.
I think it should be.

3548
02:37:27,250 --> 02:37:27,710
That's heavy.
Yeah,

3549
02:37:27,950 --> 02:37:30,230
it should be.
Obviously he went to sort of a different

3550
02:37:30,231 --> 02:37:30,800
place,
but it's,

3551
02:37:30,801 --> 02:37:35,801
yeah,
we basically trigger drunk people for a 

3552
02:37:35,801 --> 02:37:35,801
living that just want to be heard.
You have with that.

3553
02:37:35,801 --> 02:37:36,710
So,
so innocuous.

3554
02:37:36,711 --> 02:37:39,080
Like why would anybody be upset the have
a jar of coins.

3555
02:37:39,160 --> 02:37:40,940
I mean it's kind of funny because a lot 
of guys do.

3556
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:46,000
You have a jar and they chuck coins in 
it and then they eventually bring it to 

3557
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:46,000
the bank.
Go do something with this.

3558
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:50,050
Yeah.
It was just like a shitty observational 

3559
02:37:50,050 --> 02:37:50,050
jokes from six years ago,
you know.

3560
02:37:50,050 --> 02:37:53,981
But I get a lot of times I'm the most 
annoying thing is actually just when 

3561
02:37:53,981 --> 02:37:54,770
people are like so true.

3562
02:37:58,950 --> 02:38:00,740
Like just to,
oh I.

3563
02:38:01,010 --> 02:38:06,010
for me,
that compliments the backhanded 

3564
02:38:06,010 --> 02:38:06,010
compliments after the show are always 
the worst.

3565
02:38:06,010 --> 02:38:07,250
Like you're really funny for them or 
like,

3566
02:38:07,251 --> 02:38:08,870
um,
I don't care what anyone says.

3567
02:38:08,871 --> 02:38:12,530
You're hilarious.
It's stuff like that,

3568
02:38:12,531 --> 02:38:13,100
hey,
hey,

3569
02:38:13,130 --> 02:38:18,130
don't my friend hates you.
But I think you're pretty good at 

3570
02:38:18,130 --> 02:38:18,130
listening to them.
You're amazing.

3571
02:38:18,410 --> 02:38:20,390
You know,
just sort of like so many crazy people.

3572
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:21,830
Thirty four.
I mean,

3573
02:38:21,831 --> 02:38:26,831
I get the craziest,
the craziest.

3574
02:38:27,380 --> 02:38:29,660
I mean,
you're so much prettier in person.

3575
02:38:30,140 --> 02:38:32,780
You're actually really pretty well.
That's actually nice.

3576
02:38:33,220 --> 02:38:35,120
It's a nice thing to say there's ever an
actual.

3577
02:38:35,121 --> 02:38:39,950
You're actually funny,
but that's night people.

3578
02:38:39,951 --> 02:38:41,540
Don't you think people would just 
awkward?

3579
02:38:41,630 --> 02:38:42,680
Yes.
People get awkward.

3580
02:38:42,740 --> 02:38:45,590
Well,
I mean just like a guy trying to contact

3581
02:38:45,591 --> 02:38:50,591
you on a dating app.
They don't know how to like sort of 

3582
02:38:50,591 --> 02:38:50,591
thinking.
I'm like,

3583
02:38:50,591 --> 02:38:51,830
no,
I have really low self esteem.

3584
02:38:51,830 --> 02:38:54,500
Next question.
Sitting in front of his phone,

3585
02:38:54,501 --> 02:38:56,060
trying to think of the right thing to 
say,

3586
02:38:56,870 --> 02:38:59,030
what do you get people,
you must have people.

3587
02:38:59,060 --> 02:39:02,570
Because I think for comics,
like with celebrities who are like movie

3588
02:39:02,571 --> 02:39:03,530
stars,
people are like,

3589
02:39:03,531 --> 02:39:04,290
oh my God,
look down,

3590
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:06,260
sorry,
that's emily blunt or whatever.

3591
02:39:06,530 --> 02:39:08,150
Right?
But with us,

3592
02:39:08,151 --> 02:39:08,670
they're like,
well,

3593
02:39:08,750 --> 02:39:11,840
it's like they think we're friends,
I find,

3594
02:39:11,841 --> 02:39:13,480
at least with me,
and uh,

3595
02:39:13,550 --> 02:39:17,390
people are super comfortable even more 
so because of the podcast.

3596
02:39:17,530 --> 02:39:22,530
Yeah.
Do people just come up to you and 

3597
02:39:22,530 --> 02:39:22,530
they're like,
hey man,

3598
02:39:22,530 --> 02:39:22,530
all the time I used to fight.
Yeah,

3599
02:39:22,610 --> 02:39:23,770
they just want to talk about all 
constantly.

3600
02:39:23,810 --> 02:39:26,330
But the problem is sometimes I'm with my
kids and they just want to talk to me.

3601
02:39:26,331 --> 02:39:27,230
I'm like,
I can't talk to you.

3602
02:39:27,231 --> 02:39:29,570
What do you do?
You just say my family,

3603
02:39:29,571 --> 02:39:30,320
man.
I got to go,

3604
02:39:31,650 --> 02:39:32,810
hey man,
I got to ask you a question.

3605
02:39:33,800 --> 02:39:35,480
And they'll just go into these in depth 
questions.

3606
02:39:35,481 --> 02:39:36,500
Like,
this is not happening.

3607
02:39:36,501 --> 02:39:41,501
I'm holding the hand of a six year old 
right now and I'm on my way to do 

3608
02:39:41,501 --> 02:39:44,261
something like this is not,
we're not going to sit here for half an 

3609
02:39:44,261 --> 02:39:44,261
hour.
So you can talk about conor Mcgregor.

3610
02:39:44,261 --> 02:39:48,180
I mean,
it's a victory that you have created 

3611
02:39:48,180 --> 02:39:48,180
such a group of people who are so into 
it.

3612
02:39:48,180 --> 02:39:49,340
People come up to me about your,
uh,

3613
02:39:49,341 --> 02:39:51,320
your show Cordela,
uh,

3614
02:39:51,380 --> 02:39:52,780
at the gym,
but the gym.

3615
02:39:52,970 --> 02:39:54,830
So he's not talking about anal sex,
it's always.

3616
02:39:54,831 --> 02:39:55,370
Yeah.
They were like,

3617
02:39:55,371 --> 02:40:00,371
hey,
so I want to do is listen to you on 

3618
02:40:01,281 --> 02:40:03,370
podcast.
People know so much about us that.

3619
02:40:03,380 --> 02:40:04,850
I mean it is tricky.
You.

3620
02:40:04,851 --> 02:40:09,851
I don't have a family,
but when I'm on dates and people are 

3621
02:40:09,851 --> 02:40:09,851
like,
hey,

3622
02:40:09,851 --> 02:40:09,851
like how's your knee?
I'm like,

3623
02:40:09,851 --> 02:40:11,270
why?
You guys are always like,

3624
02:40:11,300 --> 02:40:12,470
who is this person?
I'm like,

3625
02:40:12,471 --> 02:40:13,820
I've never met this person.

3626
02:40:14,030 --> 02:40:15,440
What do they know more about you than I 
do?

3627
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:21,020
Well,
you get exposed in a weird way when you 

3628
02:40:21,020 --> 02:40:21,460
do these long form conversations,
you can't forget it.

3629
02:40:21,570 --> 02:40:24,160
They can't hide.
I think that's who you are,

3630
02:40:24,390 --> 02:40:24,930
you know?

3631
02:40:25,190 --> 02:40:26,210
Yeah.
But it's like.

3632
02:40:26,211 --> 02:40:31,211
I definitely,
I mean I would imagine your listeners 

3633
02:40:31,211 --> 02:40:31,211
know more about you than your wife does.

3634
02:40:31,211 --> 02:40:31,430
No,
she knows a lot of.

3635
02:40:31,440 --> 02:40:32,400
Really?
Yeah.

3636
02:40:32,710 --> 02:40:34,850
Does she listen?
She listens to me.

3637
02:40:35,400 --> 02:40:37,840
Hey girl.
Hey girl.

3638
02:40:37,870 --> 02:40:42,870
She was,
she was listening to me and Ron White 

3639
02:40:42,870 --> 02:40:42,870
and she just goes,
medians are so fucking weird.

3640
02:40:43,080 --> 02:40:45,420
She's like,
you guys are so honest.

3641
02:40:45,660 --> 02:40:46,370
Like you,
you,

3642
02:40:46,380 --> 02:40:51,380
you,
you reveal shit that people would hide 

3643
02:40:51,380 --> 02:40:51,620
until their death bed.
It's true.

3644
02:40:52,080 --> 02:40:57,080
And you guys are talking about it and 
laugh and like Ron White was talking 

3645
02:40:57,080 --> 02:40:57,150
about accidentally getting his dick 
sucked by a bunch of guys.

3646
02:40:57,290 --> 02:40:57,950
I know,
I know,

3647
02:40:58,160 --> 02:40:59,640
I know.
It's really weird.

3648
02:41:00,030 --> 02:41:03,390
I listened to the episode.
I'm obsessed with Ron

3649
02:41:03,880 --> 02:41:07,570
in a million ways and I remember when he
said,

3650
02:41:07,571 --> 02:41:10,000
I just want respect from my peers.
And I was,

3651
02:41:10,030 --> 02:41:12,130
you know,
when we say things that no one else,

3652
02:41:12,220 --> 02:41:15,670
everyone thinks but no one else says,
I think it gives them grace to them.

3653
02:41:15,671 --> 02:41:17,770
So I think we sort of serve that 
purpose.

3654
02:41:17,950 --> 02:41:19,910
Well,
I think that's got to be the worst thing

3655
02:41:19,911 --> 02:41:22,390
in the world is even being successful.
You know,

3656
02:41:22,520 --> 02:41:24,290
we can name a few people that are like 
this,

3657
02:41:24,291 --> 02:41:28,040
but even being successful,
hated and despised by their peers.

3658
02:41:28,230 --> 02:41:29,840
It's hard.
It's like you don't,

3659
02:41:29,870 --> 02:41:32,090
you're a man without a country like 
your,

3660
02:41:32,091 --> 02:41:32,620
your law.

3661
02:41:32,750 --> 02:41:34,630
The only people that understood me now,
hey,

3662
02:41:34,710 --> 02:41:36,650
that happened when I,
I got a TV show and all the,

3663
02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:40,880
the comedy store and the comments that 
were like my family,

3664
02:41:40,940 --> 02:41:45,940
you know?
And then I got a show and then all of a 

3665
02:41:45,940 --> 02:41:46,640
sudden everyone was mad at me and it was
the was around back then.

3666
02:41:46,660 --> 02:41:47,180
It was.
Yeah,

3667
02:41:47,270 --> 02:41:49,160
you were.
I'm trying to think when that was.

3668
02:41:49,330 --> 02:41:50,180
It was like five,
six years,

3669
02:41:50,210 --> 02:41:53,000
five years ago maybe.
It was the loneliest I've ever felt.

3670
02:41:53,001 --> 02:41:58,001
I was like,
the only people who understand me now 

3671
02:41:58,001 --> 02:41:58,001
hate me.
So jealous and week.

3672
02:41:58,001 --> 02:41:59,150
It was awful.
Terrible.

3673
02:41:59,151 --> 02:42:02,530
I now know that it was just like them 
being insecure and wanting,

3674
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:07,540
you know.
And then everybody now has everyone's 

3675
02:42:07,540 --> 02:42:07,540
got a show now

3676
02:42:07,540 --> 02:42:10,650
you know,
there's a lot of people that do have 

3677
02:42:10,650 --> 02:42:12,391
this feeling that's never gonna happen 
for them and there is no greater way to 

3678
02:42:12,391 --> 02:42:17,011
ensure that it's never going to happen 
for you then to have this feeling and 

3679
02:42:17,011 --> 02:42:17,770
ride it out that it's never going to 
happen for you.

3680
02:42:17,830 --> 02:42:22,830
It's like it's self fulfilling prophecy.
It's like the opposite of a placebo 

3681
02:42:22,830 --> 02:42:22,830
effect

3682
02:42:23,570 --> 02:42:28,570
when it happens,
just you better be ready because it's 

3683
02:42:28,570 --> 02:42:28,570
not gonna work.
If you're not ready.

3684
02:42:28,570 --> 02:42:28,970
Right.
And even if you're ready,

3685
02:42:28,971 --> 02:42:30,800
it might not work.
And if it doesn't work,

3686
02:42:30,950 --> 02:42:33,260
you can't think it's the end of time.
You gotta keep going,

3687
02:42:33,290 --> 02:42:34,850
you gotta keep set of Cameron.

3688
02:42:35,020 --> 02:42:40,020
But if you haven't healed the wound that
made you want the thing in the first 

3689
02:42:40,020 --> 02:42:40,020
place,
the thing is not going to affect.

3690
02:42:40,020 --> 02:42:44,550
Absolutely.
I've gone into depth with comedians 

3691
02:42:44,550 --> 02:42:45,130
about that because I think that's an 
important thing to think.

3692
02:42:45,131 --> 02:42:47,170
We all started out from a fucked up 
place.

3693
02:42:47,440 --> 02:42:52,440
Every comedian that's any good starts 
out from a place of insecurity and 

3694
02:42:52,440 --> 02:42:54,850
weakness,
and then somewhere along the line you've

3695
02:42:54,851 --> 02:42:58,330
got to become more secure and then it's 
going to become about art.

3696
02:42:58,360 --> 02:43:01,480
It's got to become about creating 
something that's good that people enjoy,

3697
02:43:01,860 --> 02:43:05,560
and then it's got to be about doing 
something that people.

3698
02:43:05,561 --> 02:43:07,720
It's going to enhance people's 
experience,

3699
02:43:07,721 --> 02:43:12,721
like they're going to go to see you,
and for an hour and a half that show 

3700
02:43:12,721 --> 02:43:16,230
going to be so fun.
They're going to feel they're going to 

3701
02:43:16,230 --> 02:43:16,230
literally feel better,
and it's got to be that healer.

3702
02:43:16,230 --> 02:43:16,930
Yeah,
and you're.

3703
02:43:16,931 --> 02:43:19,360
You're whatever.
Good feeling you get out of that.

3704
02:43:19,660 --> 02:43:21,300
Here's the sacrifice.
You're not gonna.

3705
02:43:21,320 --> 02:43:22,890
Enjoy it at all.
You're going to like,

3706
02:43:22,980 --> 02:43:27,980
I enjoy onstage killing,
but the creating in the process and the 

3707
02:43:27,980 --> 02:43:32,641
going over the material and writing and 
the chipping away at your fucking why is

3708
02:43:32,741 --> 02:43:34,340
it suck?
This topic sucks.

3709
02:43:34,350 --> 02:43:36,940
Should I abandon it or should I just 
keep working at it

3710
02:43:37,630 --> 02:43:39,670
or it's working,
but it's fucking cheap.

3711
02:43:39,690 --> 02:43:44,690
Yeah.
And why the fuck are you guys laughing 

3712
02:43:44,690 --> 02:43:44,690
at this?
This sucks.

3713
02:43:44,690 --> 02:43:45,440
I can't do that sort of self love and 
hate yourself.

3714
02:43:45,510 --> 02:43:50,510
It's like it's like figuring out a way 
to heal the wound that made you funny 

3715
02:43:50,510 --> 02:43:53,470
but also stay funny.
So can you be healthy and funny?

3716
02:43:53,530 --> 02:43:56,280
I think that's my biggest question.
Can Struggle.

3717
02:43:56,300 --> 02:43:57,350
Yeah.
But it's not easy.

3718
02:43:57,420 --> 02:44:02,420
It's definitely a balancing act and 
there's something that happens to 

3719
02:44:02,420 --> 02:44:04,961
comedians when they become famous that 
their main motivation was to get that 

3720
02:44:04,961 --> 02:44:06,920
love and then they get it and then they 
fucking suck.

3721
02:44:06,950 --> 02:44:11,950
Yeah.
Something happens that you stay 

3722
02:44:11,950 --> 02:44:13,421
complacent.
You stop needing the approval or you 

3723
02:44:13,421 --> 02:44:13,421
stop.
You know,

3724
02:44:13,421 --> 02:44:14,960
that's the perfectionism thing because 
perfectionism is a lot of why I'm like,

3725
02:44:14,961 --> 02:44:19,961
so like my bar is so high for what to 
say on stage and if I lower that bar as 

3726
02:44:20,270 --> 02:44:21,830
it going to be less quality,
you know,

3727
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:27,160
maintaining like you just need more 
reinforcement personally in your 

3728
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:31,730
personal life to relax your 
perfectionism in your career.

3729
02:44:32,180 --> 02:44:34,310
That's what I would think.
And I think you're right.

3730
02:44:34,311 --> 02:44:36,170
And I think what happened is aligning a 
lot of people are like,

3731
02:44:36,171 --> 02:44:39,020
what do you mean you made it,
your everyone knows you and you're like,

3732
02:44:39,021 --> 02:44:41,450
well no,
that means I have to be even better.

3733
02:44:41,550 --> 02:44:43,310
Right?
Like the bar is now higher.

3734
02:44:43,330 --> 02:44:45,690
That's why you're scared to do a set at 
the ice house.

3735
02:44:45,870 --> 02:44:46,830
Well,
I'm just kind of like,

3736
02:44:47,190 --> 02:44:48,900
we've talked about this.
I have a,

3737
02:44:48,990 --> 02:44:53,760
a like allergy to doing old material and
it makes me feel like a phony,

3738
02:44:53,780 --> 02:44:55,440
but it's good.
You should give it to some people.

3739
02:44:55,441 --> 02:44:58,260
I know.
Can you spit in their mouth?

3740
02:45:00,690 --> 02:45:01,830
That's the thing.
By the way,

3741
02:45:01,831 --> 02:45:04,460
there's a lot of open your mouth so I 
can spit in it happening.

3742
02:45:04,770 --> 02:45:07,440
Do you guys think we like that?
I'm going to talk directly to camera.

3743
02:45:07,740 --> 02:45:09,330
Uh,
there's a lot of.

3744
02:45:09,331 --> 02:45:12,060
Let me spit in your mouth.
I'd rather you spend on my face.

3745
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:13,500
Whoa.
Spitting in the mouth.

3746
02:45:13,501 --> 02:45:14,960
I was like,
then I have to like swap.

3747
02:45:14,980 --> 02:45:17,730
It's just like sexually spit.
Spit in your mouth.

3748
02:45:18,200 --> 02:45:19,920
Let me spit in your mouth.
Don't.

3749
02:45:19,921 --> 02:45:22,080
When did come in.
Your mouth becomes so boring.

3750
02:45:22,440 --> 02:45:24,770
Now there's the spinning in the mouth.
There's a lot of spitting.

3751
02:45:25,430 --> 02:45:26,650
I don't know a lot of spending.

3752
02:45:26,660 --> 02:45:29,100
A lot of them don't get it.
Degradation.

3753
02:45:30,560 --> 02:45:32,160
I don't get it.
I have heard though,

3754
02:45:32,161 --> 02:45:33,630
I heard from a guy,
nope.

3755
02:45:33,660 --> 02:45:36,270
I'm obsessed with what's the most 
disrespectful thing a woman can do.

3756
02:45:36,840 --> 02:45:38,970
And I've had a couple guys say spit in 
my face.

3757
02:45:39,330 --> 02:45:40,230
Just,
I mean in general,

3758
02:45:40,560 --> 02:45:41,910
like not sexual.
Oh,

3759
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:44,970
like a woman who doesn't like you or if 
you're like,

3760
02:45:45,060 --> 02:45:50,060
you know,
this guy I know his wife spit in his 

3761
02:45:50,060 --> 02:45:50,060
face when they were in a fight and he 
was like,

3762
02:45:50,760 --> 02:45:55,760
he's like,
it took every molecule in my body not 

3763
02:45:55,760 --> 02:45:56,640
to,
not to work the back right here.

3764
02:45:56,700 --> 02:45:58,320
Just lose my mind.
And kill her.

3765
02:45:59,100 --> 02:46:04,100
That was his,
the most disrespectful because I'm 

3766
02:46:04,100 --> 02:46:04,100
always interested in what,
you know,

3767
02:46:04,100 --> 02:46:04,500
people will stay with her.
Yeah.

3768
02:46:04,590 --> 02:46:06,310
She's married three.
Hilarious.

3769
02:46:06,320 --> 02:46:07,860
Yeah,
we've got to Barry,

3770
02:46:07,861 --> 02:46:10,970
he's in the military like he's all about
respect and whatever.

3771
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:14,090
She's trying to push that,
like she can slap me all day long,

3772
02:46:14,120 --> 02:46:17,030
but spitting in my face that is the most
disrespectful thing you can do to a man.

3773
02:46:17,280 --> 02:46:19,740
So very dangerous thing when you get 
physical with people.

3774
02:46:20,050 --> 02:46:21,340
Super Dangerous People's.

3775
02:46:21,730 --> 02:46:23,030
It's just,
it's very interesting.

3776
02:46:23,031 --> 02:46:27,410
I have a very high tolerance for 
physical disrespect.

3777
02:46:28,100 --> 02:46:33,100
I mean just I,
and I was dealing with this with my 

3778
02:46:33,100 --> 02:46:33,680
horse the other day.
She was disrespectful horses.

3779
02:46:33,681 --> 02:46:37,220
So you have to claim your space with a 
horse and you have to draw a boundary if

3780
02:46:37,221 --> 02:46:39,350
you guys are going to like be around 
because they can kill you.

3781
02:46:39,670 --> 02:46:42,470
And I don't really do it with eye.
You have to do it with dogs.

3782
02:46:42,471 --> 02:46:44,180
I made a mistake.
I mean,

3783
02:46:44,181 --> 02:46:49,181
yeah,
you just sort of claim your space and 

3784
02:46:49,181 --> 02:46:50,951
they actually respect you more and like 
you more when you have self respect and 

3785
02:46:50,951 --> 02:46:52,790
you have sort of your boundary or else 
they'll just walk all over you.

3786
02:46:52,791 --> 02:46:53,720
I mean,
it's metaphorical.

3787
02:46:53,721 --> 02:46:55,190
You don't seem to have this problem in 
your life.

3788
02:46:55,420 --> 02:46:56,630
Um,
but with dogs,

3789
02:46:56,660 --> 02:46:58,790
you also,
for a dog to lay on top of you,

3790
02:46:58,791 --> 02:47:01,760
that's dominant.
We mistake it is like we're curdling but

3791
02:47:01,761 --> 02:47:03,650
they're actually in your space and 
they're like,

3792
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:04,700
oh,
well I own you now.

3793
02:47:04,970 --> 02:47:05,810
You know?
Yeah.

3794
02:47:05,811 --> 02:47:10,811
So a lot of times with my dogs,
especially since I get rescue dogs who 

3795
02:47:10,811 --> 02:47:11,510
are unpredictable and pimples have a 
very high arousal rate.

3796
02:47:11,750 --> 02:47:14,830
So I can't just let them lay on me all 
night long and stuff.

3797
02:47:14,840 --> 02:47:19,840
I have to then go,
now you're off of me and you're my 

3798
02:47:19,840 --> 02:47:19,840
bitch.
I'm not your bitch.

3799
02:47:19,840 --> 02:47:21,560
Because that could backfire later.

3800
02:47:22,040 --> 02:47:23,630
Jesus.
Yeah.

3801
02:47:23,660 --> 02:47:28,660
Dogs are so weird when you rescue them 
because you just don't know what the 

3802
02:47:28,660 --> 02:47:29,120
fuck they had to deal with.
Just don't know.

3803
02:47:29,140 --> 02:47:29,360
Yeah.

3804
02:47:29,420 --> 02:47:34,420
And I made some major mistakes of 
mistaking physical proximity with like 

3805
02:47:35,540 --> 02:47:37,850
trust.
And we'll be fine,

3806
02:47:38,480 --> 02:47:39,900
but when they're full grown.
Yeah,

3807
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:43,620
because if they get possessive of you or
attached to you or um,

3808
02:47:43,640 --> 02:47:46,220
we sometimes think that's so cute,
but sometimes it's actually dominant.

3809
02:47:46,340 --> 02:47:51,340
Well,
it's also when you bring other people 

3810
02:47:51,340 --> 02:47:54,011
into your life and then this dog decides
to other people stealing you from them 

3811
02:47:54,011 --> 02:47:54,860
and they get aggressive towards the 
other person,

3812
02:47:54,861 --> 02:47:55,610
it becomes an issue.

3813
02:47:55,740 --> 02:47:56,340
Yeah.
Well,

3814
02:47:56,341 --> 02:47:58,620
I mean it's really.
Dogs are just extensions of their own or

3815
02:47:58,621 --> 02:48:03,621
like you also have to let them know,
like I can talk to whoever the fuck I 

3816
02:48:03,621 --> 02:48:03,690
want and you're not allowed to have a 
problem with it.

3817
02:48:04,440 --> 02:48:07,400
So they're not allowed to get possessive
over you like that if you,

3818
02:48:07,540 --> 02:48:08,670
if you train them properly.

3819
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:10,710
You know what's interesting?
The puppy that I got,

3820
02:48:10,711 --> 02:48:11,680
the Golden,
he,

3821
02:48:11,940 --> 02:48:14,520
we brought him home and he gives 
everyone kisses.

3822
02:48:14,521 --> 02:48:16,530
Everyone kisses everyone because he's so
sweet.

3823
02:48:16,770 --> 02:48:18,510
But it gets to me and he wants to bite 
my face.

3824
02:48:18,810 --> 02:48:21,540
He bites my face and he would play super
rough with me.

3825
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:24,510
Like right away he was like nipping at 
but not hard.

3826
02:48:24,530 --> 02:48:25,260
Like,
it wasn't hurting me,

3827
02:48:25,261 --> 02:48:30,261
but he's fun.
Like he's an animal.

3828
02:48:30,340 --> 02:48:31,190
Have you,
uh,

3829
02:48:31,900 --> 02:48:36,900
have you put his lip under his teeth?
You put your lip just show that they 

3830
02:48:36,900 --> 02:48:38,130
learn how sharp their own teeth are.
Uh,

3831
02:48:38,390 --> 02:48:43,390
and yeah.
And then also bite them back to bite 

3832
02:48:43,390 --> 02:48:43,390
them back.
Yeah.

3833
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:45,170
I usually just put them on his back.
Yeah,

3834
02:48:45,171 --> 02:48:47,860
go ahead and cut the shit.
Hold them down with both of his,

3835
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:53,280
you know,
I'm just trying to bite me when I'm 

3836
02:48:53,280 --> 02:48:53,280
doing it because their mouth is their 
hands.

3837
02:48:53,280 --> 02:48:53,860
Like he's not trying to hurt you.

3838
02:48:54,270 --> 02:48:55,020
No,
he's,

3839
02:48:55,190 --> 02:49:00,190
he's sweet.
But he thinks my six year old is a 

3840
02:49:00,190 --> 02:49:00,190
puppy.
It's hilarious.

3841
02:49:00,190 --> 02:49:00,990
Like that's,
that's like a little puppy buddy.

3842
02:49:01,180 --> 02:49:03,960
Like he bites her clothes and stuff.
We have to keep them from doing that and

3843
02:49:03,961 --> 02:49:06,450
he's not being mean at all.
They don't care about clothes.

3844
02:49:06,720 --> 02:49:08,040
They're,
you know,

3845
02:49:08,380 --> 02:49:11,330
and they don't know until you tell them 
what is wrong.

3846
02:49:11,331 --> 02:49:16,331
Like people,
people are so bad at training their 

3847
02:49:16,331 --> 02:49:16,331
dogs.
It's shocking.

3848
02:49:16,331 --> 02:49:17,250
Like what I see like just in the streets
when I see someone with their dog,

3849
02:49:17,260 --> 02:49:18,870
like their dogs tugging and they're 
like,

3850
02:49:18,871 --> 02:49:20,070
what are you doing?
I'm like,

3851
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:21,420
Oh,
does your dog,

3852
02:49:21,421 --> 02:49:23,400
the one that speaks English and no 
sarcasm.

3853
02:49:24,060 --> 02:49:29,060
Like what you would you stop that?
It's just like the way you're saying it 

3854
02:49:29,060 --> 02:49:30,000
does not match what you're saying.
And that's not a command.

3855
02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:33,640
So I'm really into training dogs in a 
very rigorous way too.

3856
02:49:33,830 --> 02:49:35,880
You also have to teach them my kids,
like,

3857
02:49:35,881 --> 02:49:40,881
you can't.
The dog doesn't understand his name 

3858
02:49:40,881 --> 02:49:40,881
being used a bunch of different ways.
Like,

3859
02:49:40,881 --> 02:49:42,970
no,
no Marshall Marshall,

3860
02:49:43,410 --> 02:49:48,410
you've got to say no.
Children don't even understand that 

3861
02:49:48,410 --> 02:49:48,410
sarcasm,
you know?

3862
02:49:48,410 --> 02:49:48,720
And uh,
yeah.

3863
02:49:48,721 --> 02:49:53,721
And uh,
and people I think mistake and they 

3864
02:49:53,721 --> 02:49:53,721
conflate discipline with being mean to 
the dog or something.

3865
02:49:53,721 --> 02:49:54,600
It's just,
it's just not true.

3866
02:49:54,601 --> 02:49:57,780
It's discipline.
Discipline is so nice to a dog.

3867
02:49:58,050 --> 02:49:59,220
Um,
but uh,

3868
02:49:59,400 --> 02:50:00,300
yeah,
I mean it's just,

3869
02:50:00,301 --> 02:50:01,500
and,
but also when I see people,

3870
02:50:01,501 --> 02:50:05,040
I've seen some real disasters with 
placing dogs in homes where people don't

3871
02:50:05,041 --> 02:50:08,730
train their kids how to deal with dogs.
I'm a dog.

3872
02:50:09,030 --> 02:50:10,470
Child's going to get their face bitten 
off,

3873
02:50:10,471 --> 02:50:15,471
like I get so scared because people just
let their kid hit the dog in the face 

3874
02:50:15,471 --> 02:50:17,610
and shake their face and I'm like,
you have to train your child.

3875
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,040
Also.
Especially a dog dog,

3876
02:50:20,970 --> 02:50:23,060
there's a danger and bringing a dog 
around children.

3877
02:50:23,080 --> 02:50:27,120
The first place kids are like another 
dog and my dog's are giant.

3878
02:50:27,121 --> 02:50:28,730
My dog hurts me.
I've three.

3879
02:50:28,800 --> 02:50:32,370
They hurt me by accident all of the time
and I'm an adult.

3880
02:50:32,550 --> 02:50:34,460
Like I'll bend over to pick something up
and they'll come by and I.

3881
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:38,050
Yes,
they don't mean to iron heads.

3882
02:50:38,060 --> 02:50:40,580
Yeah,
they are like my just blockheads.

3883
02:50:40,590 --> 02:50:41,600
And so,
um,

3884
02:50:41,670 --> 02:50:46,670
my big dog has a great Dane pitbull and 
he just knocks me out the time.

3885
02:50:46,891 --> 02:50:49,140
So when kids come over,
they go in the crates,

3886
02:50:49,350 --> 02:50:50,700
they're not going to attack them.
But like,

3887
02:50:50,701 --> 02:50:52,890
why am I writing?
People want to take chances.

3888
02:50:52,891 --> 02:50:56,370
Let's take a selfie with the dog.
Just put it in a crate.

3889
02:50:56,371 --> 02:50:58,980
Super Dangerous.
It's got razor blades in its mouth.

3890
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:04,040
It's just,
it's gonna make a mistake sooner or 

3891
02:51:04,040 --> 02:51:04,040
later.
So I just,

3892
02:51:04,040 --> 02:51:04,040
I mean,
I,

3893
02:51:04,040 --> 02:51:08,870
I used to be really naive about it,
but it's interesting with German 

3894
02:51:08,870 --> 02:51:11,781
shepherds apparently in a Ketos and I 
always say if anything looks too much 

3895
02:51:11,781 --> 02:51:16,491
like a wolf,
like be fucking super care for around 

3896
02:51:16,491 --> 02:51:20,030
kids with it.
There's this guy that has really been 

3897
02:51:20,030 --> 02:51:20,030
helping this guy,
Brandon Mcmillan,

3898
02:51:20,030 --> 02:51:24,350
he's got a show called lucky dog on cbs 
and he taught me how to aggression test 

3899
02:51:24,350 --> 02:51:28,701
dogs with two leashes and stuff that I 
was just getting these dogs from 

3900
02:51:28,701 --> 02:51:28,701
shelters that had been abused and stuff.

3901
02:51:28,701 --> 02:51:31,050
And I'm like,
my love isn't gonna make you trained?

3902
02:51:32,280 --> 02:51:37,280
No,
it's not like living in the valley with 

3903
02:51:37,280 --> 02:51:38,310
a yard that's gonna fix you.
It's not true.

3904
02:51:38,410 --> 02:51:40,620
Um,
so I've learned to sort of honor,

3905
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:45,800
um,
the neurology of dogs and their 

3906
02:51:45,800 --> 02:51:47,901
instincts and they were wolves and,
and food comes first and if they have a 

3907
02:51:48,151 --> 02:51:53,151
scarcity complex,
like they're going to go after food and 

3908
02:51:53,151 --> 02:51:56,031
if they've been abused,
like they have no reason to not protect 

3909
02:51:56,031 --> 02:51:57,930
themselves if they feel threatened.
Is that dog whisperer guy?

3910
02:51:57,931 --> 02:52:00,180
That Cesar Milan guy,
is he good or is he?

3911
02:52:00,181 --> 02:52:01,380
Yeah,
I mean he's like,

3912
02:52:01,410 --> 02:52:06,410
all these guys have,
I'm sure like any like fighting or 

3913
02:52:06,410 --> 02:52:06,410
anything,
everyone's got logged,

3914
02:52:06,410 --> 02:52:06,850
that's wrong,
that's wrong.

3915
02:52:06,851 --> 02:52:09,520
Everyone's got their own,
like I've figured out what works for me,

3916
02:52:09,521 --> 02:52:10,570
which is like,
um,

3917
02:52:10,740 --> 02:52:13,360
uh,
basically positive reinforcement or just

3918
02:52:13,361 --> 02:52:14,890
ignoring the dog when they do something 
wrong.

3919
02:52:14,890 --> 02:52:16,960
So the biggest punishment to a dog was 
just ignoring them.

3920
02:52:17,170 --> 02:52:22,170
When you hit them,
you're actually giving them attention 

3921
02:52:22,170 --> 02:52:22,170
and confusing them or when you yell.
Yeah,

3922
02:52:22,170 --> 02:52:26,730
it just,
it's confusing to them and it probably 

3923
02:52:26,730 --> 02:52:29,611
doesn't hurt.
They usually just lose respect for you 

3924
02:52:29,611 --> 02:52:32,071
because you,
because you've gotten into a situation 

3925
02:52:32,071 --> 02:52:32,071
where you're now hitting them and 
they're just like,

3926
02:52:32,071 --> 02:52:34,080
why did you let me do that yesterday?
Like,

3927
02:52:34,300 --> 02:52:39,300
you're the one that's inconsistent and 
then they just start to feel unsafe and 

3928
02:52:39,300 --> 02:52:39,790
anxious.
So when they do something wrong,

3929
02:52:39,791 --> 02:52:43,000
just ignore them for 30 minutes and they
will never do it again.

3930
02:52:43,030 --> 02:52:46,240
Because you read books on dogs.
I do read books on dogs.

3931
02:52:46,590 --> 02:52:51,590
Yeah.
Would you read books on more people or 

3932
02:52:51,590 --> 02:52:51,590
dogs?
People,

3933
02:52:51,590 --> 02:52:51,760
do you?
Yeah.

3934
02:52:52,330 --> 02:52:54,310
Well,
I mean your dog is a reflection here.

3935
02:52:54,370 --> 02:52:54,790
Yeah.
Well,

3936
02:52:54,791 --> 02:52:56,610
I was just thinking about it sounds like
recently,

3937
02:52:56,680 --> 02:53:01,680
I mean,
I've read a lot of books on like 

3938
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:01,680
addiction and like,
yeah,

3939
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:03,190
and like neuroscience that's kind of 
like,

3940
02:53:03,670 --> 02:53:08,670
you know,
I'm finishing that book sapiens right 

3941
02:53:08,670 --> 02:53:08,670
now,
which is that it's about like,

3942
02:53:08,670 --> 02:53:09,610
um,
what's the guy's name is seth,

3943
02:53:09,790 --> 02:53:11,590
last name seth the or something.

3944
02:53:11,880 --> 02:53:16,880
Um,
it's basically about evolution and how 

3945
02:53:16,880 --> 02:53:20,191
we evolved to be the way we are.
Like his whole point is that we're a 

3946
02:53:20,191 --> 02:53:23,880
non.
His whole point one of them that I find 

3947
02:53:23,880 --> 02:53:25,741
interesting is like that the reason we 
have so much anxiety is because we know 

3948
02:53:25,741 --> 02:53:25,741
that we're,
um,

3949
02:53:25,741 --> 02:53:30,180
like we implicitly know that we're only 
superficially at the top of the food 

3950
02:53:30,180 --> 02:53:30,180
chain.
Like we don't,

3951
02:53:30,340 --> 02:53:33,040
we don't deserve to be at the top of the
food chain without weapons.

3952
02:53:33,280 --> 02:53:36,610
Like A,
if I'm in here with a gorilla alone,

3953
02:53:36,790 --> 02:53:39,790
I'm going to lose real quickly if I'm,
if I'm in here with a gun,

3954
02:53:39,791 --> 02:53:41,890
I still might lose actually.
But,

3955
02:53:41,891 --> 02:53:46,891
um,
but that we're all kind of like walking 

3956
02:53:46,891 --> 02:53:47,920
around with paper thin scan and we're 
incredibly vulnerable.

3957
02:53:48,250 --> 02:53:50,680
Um,
but we just happen to have,

3958
02:53:50,830 --> 02:53:52,870
you know,
the animals that kill us in cages.

3959
02:53:52,960 --> 02:53:57,960
I just think it's incredibly fascinating
that anatomically similar humans who 

3960
02:53:57,960 --> 02:54:01,351
lived 10,000
years ago as we were talking about with 

3961
02:54:01,351 --> 02:54:02,350
cro magnon who literally didn't have 
very many tools or weapons,

3962
02:54:02,351 --> 02:54:03,820
I mean,
didn't have guns for sure.

3963
02:54:04,120 --> 02:54:06,460
And maybe,
I mean had adult adult or something like

3964
02:54:06,461 --> 02:54:11,461
that.
I don't find out when they invented the 

3965
02:54:11,461 --> 02:54:11,461
bone arrow.
Jamie,

3966
02:54:11,461 --> 02:54:11,461
let's figure that out

3967
02:54:11,461 --> 02:54:12,440
in the bone marrow is also not a sure 
thing.

3968
02:54:12,441 --> 02:54:17,441
You got one chance if you miss it,
you have another 10 minutes so you can 

3969
02:54:18,080 --> 02:54:18,920
panic.
Yeah.

3970
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:24,000
And you brought me.
How many times have you had to shoot a 

3971
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:24,000
bow and Arrow when your life depends.

3972
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:24,070
I've never done it once.

3973
02:54:24,180 --> 02:54:27,040
That's amazing that people before then.
I mean,

3974
02:54:27,130 --> 02:54:29,170
so let's go back even earlier than 
10,000

3975
02:54:29,171 --> 02:54:34,171
years ago.
Probably hope not a whole lot of 

3976
02:54:34,171 --> 02:54:34,171
difference between those people and 
people 100,000

3977
02:54:34,171 --> 02:54:38,401
years ago with the amount of tissue and 
the softness of the body and the 

3978
02:54:38,401 --> 02:54:42,871
vulnerability.
Like it's kind of crazy that we even 

3979
02:54:42,871 --> 02:54:42,871
made it.

3980
02:54:42,871 --> 02:54:45,810
We're made of the fact that we get 
through the day without a up balloons of

3981
02:54:46,451 --> 02:54:48,450
blood bees can kill us.
Yeah.

3982
02:54:48,670 --> 02:54:50,980
Bees are the literally tiniest animal.

3983
02:54:51,330 --> 02:54:53,520
Okay.
Bow and Arrow appears to transition from

3984
02:54:53,521 --> 02:54:56,540
the Upper Paleolithic to the Meso 
Lithic,

3985
02:54:57,890 --> 02:54:59,140
so blah,
blah,

3986
02:54:59,150 --> 02:54:59,880
blah.
Oldest,

3987
02:54:59,881 --> 02:55:00,870
elegant bow.
Hold on.

3988
02:55:00,871 --> 02:55:04,100
What'd you do?
Extent bows in one piece

3989
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:06,590
or Elm Houma.
Guard bows from Denmark,

3990
02:55:06,591 --> 02:55:08,690
which were dated to 9,000
BC.

3991
02:55:08,840 --> 02:55:10,820
Huh?
Wow.

3992
02:55:10,970 --> 02:55:15,970
Ece?
I like how they do that now before 

3993
02:55:15,970 --> 02:55:15,970
current era.
It's not even about Jesus.

3994
02:55:15,970 --> 02:55:20,800
Wow.
Africa suggested arrows might be at 

3995
02:55:20,800 --> 02:55:20,800
least 71,000
years old.

3996
02:55:20,800 --> 02:55:22,760
Holy Shit.
Wow,

3997
02:55:23,330 --> 02:55:25,210
that's crazy.
That is crazy.

3998
02:55:25,730 --> 02:55:28,520
Um,
so they had arrows for like 50,000

3999
02:55:28,521 --> 02:55:29,620
years for the.
Figured out the bow.

4000
02:55:30,630 --> 02:55:33,770
Got To do something with this.
Has this always been here?

4001
02:55:33,771 --> 02:55:35,960
This epidemic of fear?
I mean,

4002
02:55:35,961 --> 02:55:37,730
like this election.
The fear.

4003
02:55:37,731 --> 02:55:38,450
I'm kidding.
By the way.

4004
02:55:38,451 --> 02:55:41,530
I'm sure they had a po folks.
If people are going to tweet and running

4005
02:55:41,540 --> 02:55:43,430
now,
they're all just going back in.

4006
02:55:44,710 --> 02:55:49,160
History has always been here.
I mean the gun.

4007
02:55:49,190 --> 02:55:54,190
People want guns in their house all the 
time and I'm not against people have 

4008
02:55:54,190 --> 02:55:54,190
guns,
walls.

4009
02:55:54,510 --> 02:55:57,650
It is what it is.
Why are people so scared?

4010
02:55:57,651 --> 02:55:59,390
People are going to take their guns away
from them.

4011
02:55:59,390 --> 02:56:01,100
They need the guns.
There's fear.

4012
02:56:01,490 --> 02:56:03,490
Well,
because there are.

4013
02:56:03,510 --> 02:56:08,510
If I have a theory,
my biggest theory is not just that some 

4014
02:56:08,510 --> 02:56:12,101
people live in bad neighborhoods,
but also that we're dealing with the 

4015
02:56:12,101 --> 02:56:14,411
news of 7 billion humans.
I was just too much and we see now that 

4016
02:56:14,411 --> 02:56:18,260
we have the news and we see so much 
negative things happening that we have a

4017
02:56:18,261 --> 02:56:20,900
false sense of how dangerous the world 
is,

4018
02:56:21,010 --> 02:56:23,660
where this is all bad.
We're the safest we've ever been.

4019
02:56:23,970 --> 02:56:24,950
Scared us.
We've ever been.

4020
02:56:25,220 --> 02:56:30,220
Are We?
I don't know if it was a scarce we ever 

4021
02:56:30,220 --> 02:56:30,220
been because a lot of people are on 
Xanax again.

4022
02:56:30,220 --> 02:56:33,670
That's true.
They'd be scared if they weren't on 

4023
02:56:33,670 --> 02:56:33,670
Xanax,
they'd be shitting their pants,

4024
02:56:33,670 --> 02:56:35,690
but everyone is like,
you know,

4025
02:56:35,870 --> 02:56:40,870
terrified all the time and it's just 
sort of an interesting thing and trying 

4026
02:56:40,870 --> 02:56:43,661
to figure out what's a real fear and 
what's a sort of reptilian irrational 

4027
02:56:43,661 --> 02:56:43,661
fear.

4028
02:56:43,661 --> 02:56:47,680
Well,
it's what we were talking about before 

4029
02:56:47,680 --> 02:56:50,051
that one day and probably not far from 
now we're going to exist in some sort of

4030
02:56:51,230 --> 02:56:54,980
electronic state where it exists in some
sort of a weird virtual state.

4031
02:56:55,030 --> 02:56:57,230
Yes.
And then it's going to be interesting to

4032
02:56:57,231 --> 02:57:02,231
see what that state is even more 
vulnerable because we'll have fucking 

4033
02:57:02,231 --> 02:57:04,670
google glasses over our heads and we'll 
our fucking spinal cord to connect it to

4034
02:57:04,671 --> 02:57:09,671
the matrix.
We want to have peripheral vision 

4035
02:57:09,671 --> 02:57:10,220
anymore.
We're devolving in some way for sure.

4036
02:57:10,250 --> 02:57:11,330
We're definitely not.
Well,

4037
02:57:11,360 --> 02:57:13,820
we're evolving into a more vulnerable 
thing,

4038
02:57:14,060 --> 02:57:19,060
which is weird.
It's not necessarily that we're 

4039
02:57:19,060 --> 02:57:19,060
devolving because we're not becoming 
more like animals.

4040
02:57:19,060 --> 02:57:20,000
Right.
Becoming more like,

4041
02:57:20,001 --> 02:57:25,001
um,
there was some study that came out that 

4042
02:57:25,001 --> 02:57:27,161
said that kids who play video games 
actually have faster reflexes and kids 

4043
02:57:27,161 --> 02:57:27,161
who don't.
Whoa.

4044
02:57:27,161 --> 02:57:27,800
Yeah.
It's an interesting.

4045
02:57:27,950 --> 02:57:32,950
That is so maybe reflexes have to do 
with the mind and the hands reacting 

4046
02:57:33,051 --> 02:57:34,790
hand eye coordination.
Right.

4047
02:57:34,791 --> 02:57:36,600
That makes sense.
Like you have to move quick and.

4048
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:40,040
But I mean I'm physically moving your 
body side to side.

4049
02:57:40,041 --> 02:57:45,041
They don't have the dexterity or the 
strength to do that because they're 

4050
02:57:45,041 --> 02:57:45,920
fucking just stuck to the couch,
so they'll win.

4051
02:57:46,130 --> 02:57:49,070
It has to be a thumb war.
It can't be an actual threat.

4052
02:57:49,071 --> 02:57:54,071
I don't know what the threat was that 
Jamie was talking about how they're 

4053
02:57:54,071 --> 02:57:56,741
doing these teams for basketball that 
are going to do alongside the NBA team.

4054
02:57:58,520 --> 02:57:58,900
Well,
no,

4055
02:57:58,910 --> 02:58:03,570
they're gonna play electronic basketball
alongside real basketball games.

4056
02:58:05,220 --> 02:58:10,220
Explain it here in the NBA is sports 
league diversity means a new kind of 

4057
02:58:10,220 --> 02:58:10,350
athlete.

4058
02:58:10,960 --> 02:58:11,910
Okay.
We're going to have a.

4059
02:58:12,370 --> 02:58:17,370
They haven't announced it fully because 
every team isn't fully locked into it 

4060
02:58:17,370 --> 02:58:17,370
yet right now.
But uh,

4061
02:58:17,620 --> 02:58:18,760
every team,
the idea,

4062
02:58:18,761 --> 02:58:23,761
the thing is every team is going to have
their own five on five video game team 

4063
02:58:23,761 --> 02:58:27,480
and they're gonna be responsible for 
signing good players and there's going 

4064
02:58:27,480 --> 02:58:30,691
to be competitions and big that ideally 
they want to have the finalists in 

4065
02:58:30,691 --> 02:58:30,980
arenas too for this.
The finals

4066
02:58:30,980 --> 02:58:33,080
in arenas to do for like other games 
right now,

4067
02:58:33,081 --> 02:58:37,800
like league of legends goes and plays in
a staple center sort of.

4068
02:58:38,120 --> 02:58:43,120
I'm terrified by the fact that we're 
outsourcing physical sports to our 

4069
02:58:43,120 --> 02:58:45,860
phones.
I sat next to a guy on the plane who was

4070
02:58:45,861 --> 02:58:50,861
playing darts on his phone starts 
literally.

4071
02:58:51,110 --> 02:58:56,110
He was just sitting there moving his 
finger show Whitney has a phone with a 

4072
02:58:59,301 --> 02:59:01,810
photo of this guys.
So yeah,

4073
02:59:01,860 --> 02:59:06,860
he's just.
That was the that he thinks this is a 

4074
02:59:06,860 --> 02:59:06,860
sport plus he's drinking.
He is shit.

4075
02:59:06,860 --> 02:59:11,380
Yeah.
He got shit face on him and he was also 

4076
02:59:11,380 --> 02:59:11,380
wearing shorts,
which was really traumatizing for me,

4077
02:59:11,380 --> 02:59:15,610
but it was just this and I was like,
the fact that you think this is a thing 

4078
02:59:15,610 --> 02:59:16,880
he was made.
There's just scrolling up.

4079
02:59:17,390 --> 02:59:22,390
The fact that he thought he was good at 
darts or he was freaking out about air 

4080
02:59:23,811 --> 02:59:28,811
travel.
So he's getting drunk and medicated and 

4081
02:59:28,811 --> 02:59:28,811
it's distracting himself with a stupid 
game.

4082
02:59:28,811 --> 02:59:30,620
Scares me.
I worry that we're all just zombies.

4083
02:59:30,770 --> 02:59:32,480
I think you should stop being so scared.
Okay.

4084
02:59:32,481 --> 02:59:33,140
You're right.
You're right.

4085
02:59:33,141 --> 02:59:38,141
Just live in this moment.
Let's end it strong because we've 

4086
02:59:38,141 --> 02:59:38,141
already done three.
Okay.

4087
02:59:38,141 --> 02:59:38,141
All.
I'll send this strong.

4088
02:59:38,141 --> 02:59:38,720
Okay.
What do we do?

4089
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:39,740
So I'm going to squirt.

4090
02:59:42,890 --> 02:59:45,380
People are by sub miracles still 
listening to this.

4091
02:59:45,381 --> 02:59:46,240
I really,
I,

4092
02:59:46,250 --> 02:59:47,900
you know,
I'm sure they are.

4093
02:59:47,930 --> 02:59:49,670
Do something.
Do something.

4094
02:59:49,671 --> 02:59:51,720
Do your thing.
When we got to do this more often,

4095
02:59:51,740 --> 02:59:53,360
get me Outta here.
So embarrassed.

4096
02:59:53,361 --> 02:59:55,160
That's really fun.
It's not embarrassing at all.

4097
02:59:55,490 --> 02:59:57,360
Got You.
Need more positive reinforcement.

4098
02:59:57,380 --> 02:59:59,180
Your personal life.
I'm writing a book.

4099
02:59:59,181 --> 03:00:01,490
I just sit home all day and just with my
negative thoughts.

4100
03:00:01,510 --> 03:00:03,520
That's the problem.
Some negative.

4101
03:00:03,580 --> 03:00:04,370
I know.
Call me.

4102
03:00:04,371 --> 03:00:05,660
I'm here.
Don't worry about it.

4103
03:00:05,680 --> 03:00:09,010
That was going to be fun.
You're going to be fun to write a book.

4104
03:00:11,080 --> 03:00:16,080
Why did you let me do this?
Why would have stopped me from.

4105
03:00:16,881 --> 03:00:17,390
No,
no,

4106
03:00:17,391 --> 03:00:17,810
no,
no.

4107
03:00:17,811 --> 03:00:18,770
Everything's great.
Said to me.

4108
03:00:18,771 --> 03:00:19,370
I said,
I was like,

4109
03:00:19,371 --> 03:00:20,200
are you?
Did you write a book?

4110
03:00:20,201 --> 03:00:20,690
And you're like,
yeah,

4111
03:00:20,691 --> 03:00:21,570
I gave the money back.
I was.

4112
03:00:21,620 --> 03:00:22,940
It was.
Didn't work for me and I was like,

4113
03:00:22,941 --> 03:00:23,290
well,
we're here.

4114
03:00:23,291 --> 03:00:24,770
The domains will do.
I should've listened to.

4115
03:00:24,771 --> 03:00:26,540
You know you don't.
I mean,

4116
03:00:26,660 --> 03:00:31,660
the problem with that I had was editors.
They were trying to get me to write 

4117
03:00:31,660 --> 03:00:31,660
standup.
They said,

4118
03:00:31,700 --> 03:00:32,990
I want you to write.
First of all,

4119
03:00:32,991 --> 03:00:34,280
they wanted me to.
They said,

4120
03:00:34,281 --> 03:00:35,750
look,
you don't have to write anything.

4121
03:00:35,751 --> 03:00:38,510
We'll just take your stand up and we'll 
transcribe it.

4122
03:00:38,511 --> 03:00:39,410
I go,
that's crazy.

4123
03:00:39,411 --> 03:00:40,630
I've already done that.
Yeah,

4124
03:00:40,730 --> 03:00:45,730
but they go bold.
George Carlin did that and then Jerry 

4125
03:00:45,730 --> 03:00:45,730
Seinfeld did that.
I got,

4126
03:00:45,730 --> 03:00:45,730
I don't care what they did.

4127
03:00:45,730 --> 03:00:47,030
I'm not doing that.
Like from a write something.

4128
03:00:47,031 --> 03:00:48,600
I think it's a different kind of medium.
Right.

4129
03:00:48,770 --> 03:00:49,400
Well,
it's also,

4130
03:00:49,401 --> 03:00:51,500
it's interesting because you're just 
sitting there bombing all day.

4131
03:00:53,050 --> 03:00:55,910
There's no audience.
Like my worst nightmare.

4132
03:00:55,911 --> 03:00:59,030
I have to wait eight months to see if 
something's funny and people laugh.

4133
03:00:59,140 --> 03:01:04,140
Their living room.
I can't even tell if they have to 

4134
03:01:04,140 --> 03:01:05,971
pretend the hear you say it too.
It has to like they have to have an 

4135
03:01:05,971 --> 03:01:06,670
imagination.
It's the tone and fuck all that.

4136
03:01:06,671 --> 03:01:10,030
I just have to go back to up full time 
because this is just like Amanda.

4137
03:01:10,330 --> 03:01:12,580
Everybody's wants to not do standup 
fulltime.

4138
03:01:12,610 --> 03:01:15,340
Every comic work so hard to become a 
professional class.

4139
03:01:15,350 --> 03:01:18,580
Then I learned my lesson.
I'm sorry he's back on back.

4140
03:01:18,610 --> 03:01:20,710
Come to the Ice House tomorrow night or 
Wednesday night.

4141
03:01:20,740 --> 03:01:23,020
Tomorrow I go to Florida to Orlando.
Don't be jealous.

4142
03:01:23,180 --> 03:01:26,740
Well,
next time I'll come to you heard it here

4143
03:01:26,741 --> 03:01:28,770
folks.
It's happening weeks.

4144
03:01:28,990 --> 03:01:30,220
Come see me.
Eat Shit.

4145
03:01:30,290 --> 03:01:31,090
Alright.
Thank you bro.

4146
03:01:31,450 --> 03:01:33,790
It was awesome.
Whitney.

4147
03:01:33,900 --> 03:01:35,290
Not,
not exactly happy with it.

4148
03:01:35,291 --> 03:01:36,100
Look at her.
She's like,

4149
03:01:36,101 --> 03:01:37,580
I don't believe it was awesome.
No,

4150
03:01:37,650 --> 03:01:38,560
no.
It's a disaster.

4151
03:01:38,960 --> 03:01:39,820
Disaster.
Um,

4152
03:01:39,860 --> 03:01:41,530
it was great.
You're awesome.

4153
03:01:41,850 --> 03:01:44,500
Thank you.
Bye everybody.
