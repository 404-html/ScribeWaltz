1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,600
Three,
two,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,470
one.

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,610
I'm gonna.
Do what you're doing.

4
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:13,510
What are you doing over there,
man?

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,510
What is this?
Well,

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,450
actually I was thinking about making 
sure that I'm in a position mentally and

7
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:23,320
spiritually to talk openly and clearly 
connect,

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,760
but you're doing it with fists on 
interest.

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,680
You're going to talk openly,
but you're going to be strong about it.

10
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:34,681
It's not like this.
There's this thing that the meditation 

11
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:35,560
thing where you're just gently touching 
your fingers together.

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,210
Yeah,
right.

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,810
I suppose then I'm looking to be 
embodied as well.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,850
Tense.
You're like a hybrid.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,020
Yeah,
that's right.

16
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:46,420
That's what we've got become these days.
A little bit of both.

17
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,490
A little bit of spiritual,
a little bit of warrior,

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,130
the whole thing.
We've got to survive in this world,

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,070
so you can't be all the theories.
Can't be.

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,490
It can't all be in the consciousness.
Yeah.

21
00:01:00,491 --> 00:01:01,750
Otherwise you'll never get anything 
done.

22
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,430
Right.
You'll just be constantly dealing with 

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,081
other people's wants and wishes and no.
Unless you going to make the decision to

24
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:15,341
be one of those cave people unless you.
Because last time I was thinking about 

25
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:15,341
that,
like this,

26
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:15,341
put on robes,
meditate.

27
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:20,260
I that I only live in the consciousness,
but given my extreme levels of 

28
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,020
attachment that I've experienced over 
the years to physical things,

29
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,580
I don't think that's my path.
You know,

30
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:26,140
I'm here,
I'm in the world,

31
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:31,141
I'm sending books,
I'm having a baby or caring about what 

32
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:35,251
people think about me.
I'm wondering if I'm going to be in a 

33
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:35,251
film.
I'm dealing with the world,

34
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,410
being a man in the world,
being the type of man I am.

35
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:39,070
It's not like,
oh,

36
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:44,071
you know,
I'll just real life myself off in a 

37
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:44,071
cave.
Well,

38
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,000
there's a certain amount of attraction 
that I think we all have this idea like,

39
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:47,740
hey man,
I'm just going to get away from it all.

40
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,950
But the problem is you,
it's going on whether you like it or 

41
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,950
not,
it's happening.

42
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,510
Even if you're not there.
So you should probably be there just to 

43
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,510
go,
what is this?

44
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,270
Yeah,
what is this?

45
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:02,050
Even in Christianity,
Christ says in the world,

46
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,140
but not of it.
So trying not to be defined and 

47
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,410
determined by other people's opinions of
you,

48
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,200
the systems and structures that are set 
up around you,

49
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:14,080
particularly if you question those 
systems and structures and think,

50
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,910
well,
I don't trust that system.

51
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:17,560
I agree with that,
you know,

52
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,330
just having how you don't want to be 
defined by that.

53
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:23,110
But the fact is we are here and I think 
there are certain people you know,

54
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,470
but do have a monastic tendency that 
should be meditating,

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,130
that aren't equipped for the material 
world.

56
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:35,131
And one of the great things that make me
sad about at times is if you don't have 

57
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:37,530
economic and productive value,
then you are nobody.

58
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,540
You know?
And there were some people that don't 

59
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,801
know how to resource themselves.
You've found a way of turning yourself 

60
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:44,890
into an economy of creating a kingdom.
I found my own way.

61
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,350
If I can make my mental illness work for
me,

62
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,060
people me money,
it'd be this crazy,

63
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,770
you know,
but not everyone gets those kinds of 

64
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:54,770
breaks or has that kind of skillset.
Yeah,

65
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,191
I mean obviously there's some people 
that really do thrive on that monastic 

66
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:00,160
lifestyle does.
Have you ever seen

67
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,950
this,
a vice documentary on this guy?

68
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:07,951
His name is [inaudible].
He lives in the believers that eastern 

69
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,750
part of the,
uh,

70
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,150
of Alaska.
He's in this,

71
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,640
uh,
this Arctic region.

72
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,770
It's a,
there's a,

73
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,510
a vice piece called Heimos Arctic 
adventure.

74
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,070
That's it.
Arctic refuge.

75
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,720
Hi Mo.
H e I,

76
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,470
m o heimos high malkuth is his name and 
this guy is a very.

77
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,390
HE lIves in the elastic arctic national 
wildlife refuge,

78
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,900
100 miles from tHe nearest human and he 
lives there with his wife and he lives 

79
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,521
in this little log house that he's sort 
of built himself and he thrives up 

80
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:44,120
there.
It's very strange because we're,

81
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,720
we're attracted to these people like to 
just go,

82
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:47,770
okay,
wHat do you do all day,

83
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:48,280
man,
like,

84
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:53,281
what's,
what's your life like and what do you 

85
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:53,281
do?
Do you miss people?

86
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:57,140
And he has like a vcr and he plays old 
movies and it's a fascinating thing 

87
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,370
because I think when you watch soMeone 
like that,

88
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,160
you always run it through your head.
Like,

89
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,330
could I live like that?
Like,

90
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,260
is this,
is this,

91
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,300
got happier?
And he says he is.

92
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,740
I mean,
he says that the,

93
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,860
the hunter gatherer lifestyle that he 
lives is a uniquely attractive to people

94
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:20,701
and,
and uniquely satisfying and it's 

95
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:20,740
something that we don't get in our 
everyday world,

96
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:25,741
so we're never like completely even.
Whereas he is just running around 

97
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:27,220
fishing and hunting caribou and stuff,

98
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,880
we're fitting in with someone's else's 
idea of what life should be.

99
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,460
The system within which most of us 
operate is not this.

100
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,660
What I would do if,
if I had to free star,

101
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,270
you know,
I don't mean just personally me,

102
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:43,100
russell,
I mean anthropologically yeah.

103
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:47,090
We're designed to be nabad nomadic 
tribes people.

104
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,750
When my podcast,
as I said gestion by you,

105
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,170
I had on as a guest,
yuval noah harari,

106
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:59,171
he wrote that book sapiens and he does a
lot of anthropology stuff and says about

107
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:00,160
like that,
you know,

108
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:05,161
look,
we're designed to live in tribes of 

109
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:07,001
about 75 to 100 people,
or at least that's what chimpanzees do 

110
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:10,240
when they get bigger.
THere's normally a conflict and a 

111
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,581
separation and a split in that nomadic 
tribes would follow the food sources 

112
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,650
that were available to them.
so in a way,

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,700
if you can replicate that or get close 
to that in some way of your own,

114
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,760
in your own life,
it would make sense that it would make 

115
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:24,760
you happy.

116
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,970
And we're like,
when you were saying that about the guy 

117
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:27,970
is a hundred miles away from the nearest
person I fought people,

118
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,000
there's people that live in suburbia 
that mentally or 100 miles away from the

119
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,680
nearest person that you're just really.
Your life is.

120
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:36,050
You sit in front of a screen,
you don't connect with.

121
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:38,330
People hAve not spoke to people for 
days.

122
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,600
You know,
I think about this when people make 

123
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,041
these desperate attempts to connect 
through dog in his finger in my country 

124
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,641
where people meet up in labels and just 
having anonymous sex masturbating in 

125
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:52,361
public dogging.
It's a uniquely british for nominal 

126
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:52,450
dogging.
That's where I heard of this.

127
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,790
Well welcome,
welcome to britain docking is people go 

128
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,110
la bise quite buyers and it still could 
be sort of suburban is a bit like 

129
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,110
swinging,
you know,

130
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,270
but it's like you pull up in a car with 
this isn't.

131
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,290
This is.
I've never done this.

132
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,990
I'm just clarifying.
You put up in a car with a partner,

133
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:06,530
it could be,
you know,

134
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:11,531
I think it's kind of heterosexual thing 
or home that you can do it wherever you 

135
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:11,531
know,
wherever your persuasion is.

136
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:14,120
This particular place of particular 
people and you know the lights go on and

137
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:19,121
people jerk off and you know you can 
have sex and so thinking these are 

138
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:22,271
desperate attempt to find some 
connection to nature to sort of drop 

139
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:27,120
anchor and hit your prime or self to get
into who you are because you wake up and

140
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:32,141
you've got to do your job and you've got
a screen in front of you and you're a 

141
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:32,450
consumer and you're not living in the 
world anymore.

142
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,600
You want some visceral experience.
One of the things I get from these New 

143
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:37,600
York guys,
he's like,

144
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:37,600
oh,
your person.

145
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,510
That's questing after with the whether 
it's the artery or the dmt,

146
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,680
looking for what is it that we're meant 
to be as humans and I'm doing that in my

147
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:50,681
own way.
Having unfortunately written off 

148
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:51,140
substances because my stupid stupid 
mistakes in my twenties.

149
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:56,141
I can't go into the dmt iowaska world's 
much as I would like to and like I want 

150
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:58,520
to find how is it that I be me in this 
world and yeah,

151
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:00,480
I don't think it is through isolation 
isn't.

152
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,220
I don't think it's like,
right,

153
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,430
I'm going to try and get an island and 
I'm not going to participate.

154
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:07,580
I think it's like write what you know.
We are nature.

155
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,370
We created this.
This is a form of nature.

156
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,880
Our civilizations are manifestations,
but is it the best we can do?

157
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,910
Can we change it?
Can we pull back from what seems more 

158
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,480
than ever like some kind of apocalypse 
with your current president?

159
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,810
No disrespect them with our country 
breakfast of sort of like a weird time 

160
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,800
of fracture and the manifestation of 
ugliness stuff bubbling up.

161
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,530
Affiliate like dark unconscious matter.
Bubbling up,

162
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:35,531
man.
I was in the airport traveling to here 

163
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:35,900
and I was in New York and like just the 
people that are working the lines.

164
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:40,560
When you put your cases through that 
people felt seem heavy and low and like,

165
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,140
because if you're british Donald Trump,
just something that you know,

166
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,180
you kind of make jokes about,
you hope that there isn't going to be a 

167
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,561
nuclear war,
but he seems like a sort of a comic 

168
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:50,561
figure,
but here I sort of sent,

169
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:51,200
oh,
there's pain now.

170
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:56,201
I know there's a lot of people that 
obviously liked him enough to have made 

171
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:58,661
him president of United States,
but I think even in those cases he 

172
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:00,020
speaks to a particular rage.
Something that wasn't being addressed.

173
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,230
The failure of neoliberalism that lies 
of the last 30 years of a kind of 

174
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,130
politics that was just about management 
and not about giving people truth.

175
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,210
I don't know joe.
I like,

176
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:10,730
you know,
like our individual journeys.

177
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:15,731
How can our individual journeys,
informal social and tribal journeys now 

178
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:19,361
national journeys and he's ever even 
hope anymore for such a thing as United 

179
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,610
States of America or great britain.
Or should we start looking at smaller 

180
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:24,610
projects?
Because you know,

181
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,690
if the United States of America and 
great britain leads the colonialism,

182
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,640
mass capitalism,
consumerism,

183
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,740
ecological meltdown.
If that's what you believe in,

184
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,580
then maybe we need to look at breaking 
down some of these great institutions.

185
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,980
I wonder if what's going on is that our 
biology and what we've been sort of 

186
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:45,141
programmed to for the thousands of years
of living these tribal existences where 

187
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,180
in these travel existence where you had 
the small groups of 50 to 60 or 100 

188
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,051
people plus that this is the new thing 
and that part of our chaos is are trying

189
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:58,380
to adapt to the new thing.
It's almost inevitable.

190
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:03,381
We've created this incredible way where 
we can get food to people so more people

191
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,980
had babies,
more people stayed in these areas where 

192
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,260
they're not growing food and then you 
have.

193
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,710
You're dealing with these massive 
numbers of people you know,

194
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,430
in la 20 plus million and we're trying 
to figure out like how do we get along?

195
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,790
Like how do all these different 
ideologies coincide?

196
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,600
How do,
how do we,

197
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,180
how do we cooperate?
How do we,

198
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,980
how do we figure out what to do with all
our waste?

199
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,370
I don't figure out what to do with what 
we're doing to the environment.

200
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,220
You know,
how do we figure out who's right,

201
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,550
you know,
is it is a the doom and gloom people 

202
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,010
correct or that we're going to be okay 
people correct.

203
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,870
You know,
and what's,

204
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,980
what's the right attitude to take about 
this?

205
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,040
Many of those significant movements that
you're talking about,

206
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,300
agriculture and industrialization and 
urbanization,

207
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:54,301
agriculture obviously meaning food 
available on mass industrialization,

208
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,930
products available on mass urbanization,
people living together en masse.

209
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,250
None of these things are good for the 
people on mass.

210
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:07,420
They're good for a select straw of 
people that primarily benefit.

211
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,970
You know,
like the app,

212
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:14,070
they say that the average diet of human 
being got worse after agriculture before

213
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,780
that varied diet.
People with loads of stuff after I coach

214
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,920
her urine,
potatoes,

215
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:19,780
now peasant,
you're on rice now,

216
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,840
peasants,
I think each of these movements are to 

217
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,670
benefit a particular aspect of the 
system of particular class,

218
00:10:27,671 --> 00:10:30,160
a particular structure,
a particular economic class,

219
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:33,250
and you know me and you ain't doing bad.
We have relatively near the top,

220
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:34,700
but we're not the engineers.
It.

221
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,810
There are corporations and elites to use
that very popular word these days that 

222
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,490
benefit from things being like this.
I don't.

223
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,580
When you're saying is there a way that 
we can all coalesce and get along in 

224
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,040
urban conurbations are 20 million 
people?

225
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,560
No,
because the power is to centralized.

226
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,940
Don't break down.

227
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,290
Mostly we are getting along maybe 
mostly.

228
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Mostly.
Mostly we are getting along in these 

229
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,290
weird groups and even with our whatever 
static that we have with each other.

230
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,790
Even with the weird weirdness of it all 
the diffusion of responsibility that 

231
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,650
comes with these gigantic groups and you
see things happening,

232
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,680
you just get away from them.
We still for the most part of getting 

233
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:12,710
along in this weird new world,

234
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,960
I think you'll write it in a sense,
joe,

235
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,490
like I'm not.
I'm not a demon,

236
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,350
clean guy.
I think human beings really,

237
00:11:18,351 --> 00:11:20,970
really beautiful and brilliant and like 
I don't feel like,

238
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,280
oh god,
this is such a mess.

239
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,640
what I think is is that we're trying to 
inhabit systems that are not designed 

240
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:30,750
for us to live within and I think that 
yeah,

241
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,800
people are getting on,
but I also think that there's a lot of 

242
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,930
tension in cities that everyone's one 
right turn or one traffic light away 

243
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,650
from getting out of their car and 
smashing someone in the face.

244
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:41,150
You could like feel it bubbling under in
that,

245
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:46,151
in that the feeling I had in the airport
is that the people that were working 

246
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:47,100
there were under undue stress.
Now,

247
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:52,101
this is just one anecdote,
but I feel that we're being forced to 

248
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:52,850
live on a particular aspect of our 
consciousness,

249
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:56,590
a particular bandwidth of where we kind 
of a bit fry in the foot a little bit.

250
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,340
Too much desire and I'm talking about 
most people.

251
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,370
We're again,
I'm not poor no more so I'm able to 

252
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:05,620
create money.
Creates distance.

253
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:07,570
Isn't it?
Money's like you can fuck off problems.

254
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,280
I'm getting in a nice car and I'm out of
here,

255
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,520
but like I remember the feeling and a 
lot of people are living like that where

256
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:15,400
the tensions up in their face and so 
yes,

257
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:20,401
I agree that people do muddle along and 
that's I think shows you that we're not 

258
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:24,600
as in a darwinistic model or or or some 
of the ideas derived from darwinism 

259
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,831
rather like the selfish gene and the 
richard dawkins idea that people just 

260
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:28,831
want to survive and we just want to kill
him.

261
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,160
Fucking with.
This is what propels us forward.

262
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,480
I think.
No,

263
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,610
we're coke.
We're cooperative,

264
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,590
collaborative,
artistic,

265
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:37,210
imaginative,
beautiful people,

266
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,360
but we've created systems around the 
worst aspects of our nature.

267
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,220
Greed,
selfishness.

268
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,600
This is what capitalism and consumerism 
on and this is so all encompassing.

269
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:49,840
Our cultures are domed by them and we 
can't see beyond them.

270
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:55,140
We exist within them and I feel like if 
we were to break down those kinds of 

271
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,770
systems,
live in smaller assemblies,

272
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,800
smaller groups where power is as close 
to the people that affects as possible,

273
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:03,040
where people would vote on,
well,

274
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,600
this is how we want to use our 
resources.

275
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,420
This is where we want to run our street,
our hospital,

276
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,220
our prisons,
our schools,

277
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,140
our systems.
This is how we want them to run.

278
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,300
Then things which really,
really slow down,

279
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:18,301
but man,
what's the rush into things would slow 

280
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:20,431
down and get a lot slower,
but I think that people would be 

281
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:22,891
empowered and you wouldn't have 
resources and power filtered to a small 

282
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:22,891
group of people.
No,

283
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:27,500
I think you're definitely right and I 
think you should probably start a cult 

284
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,090
idea about how to run it and how to keep

285
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:33,210
so the resources in the community,
but I think that also this discontent 

286
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:37,471
that we have is a sign that people being
upset with how this is and the momentum 

287
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:39,670
of the way things have sort of 
established themselves today.

288
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:45,030
That we is what we need.
This is the momentum and the motivation 

289
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,440
that we need to try to improve upon 
things.

290
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,830
I think we're uniquely qualified to do 
that today because we're.

291
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,720
We're talking about it so you can be the
doom and gloom guy today.

292
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:57,721
I'll be rose colored glasses,
so I think that this tension that we 

293
00:13:57,721 --> 00:14:00,691
have in this,
even like a guy like Donald Trump or 

294
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:03,451
brexit,
I think the good thing about those 

295
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:06,241
things is that people are looking at 
what they don't like about the way we 

296
00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:10,601
were running the world,
what they don't like about our culture 

297
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,940
and they're getting upset about it and 
hopefully we'll sort it out that way and

298
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:16,000
that being completely content with 
everything and everybody just sitting on

299
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:21,001
the couch and smiling all day.
It doesn't lead to necessarily lead to 

300
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:25,081
progress.
I think we're more informed now than 

301
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,740
we've ever been before,
so I would hope that with our ability to

302
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:31,741
communicate and being more informed now 
that we have the potential to move 

303
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:32,050
towards a better society.

304
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,630
I agree with that,
but I also think that that was important

305
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:41,631
in the world is who has power,
power being the ability to affect 

306
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:41,631
change.
I,

307
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,540
I'm not one of those people that are 
like,

308
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,180
I'm not like baffled by what happened 
with trump.

309
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:45,930
I feel,
oh,

310
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:50,931
there's an indication that a good many 
people feel extremely angry and 

311
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,171
disenfranchised the same as brexit and 
our country and I recognize and 

312
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:54,830
understand it similarly.
I don't think,

313
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,380
oh,
wouldn't everything be zippity doo dah.

314
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,900
If hillary clinton was president of the 
United States,

315
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:04,901
that was where the way stuff was going.
That's what the previous 30 years has 

316
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:04,910
been like in your country.
My country,

317
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:09,890
managerial politicians with no vision.
We've seen the failure of recent sort of

318
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,980
that they've kind of promises that were 
offered by an administrations recently.

319
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,730
I think that what trump is,
what brexit is,

320
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:19,970
is a big fuck you to the system like we 
want something different,

321
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,780
but for me,
in a way these things are good because I

322
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,930
believe that people that fill those 
things are right and I would like to see

323
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:28,910
more power delivered to ordinary people.

324
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,940
Genuine change happening now,
but I think it won't happen unless you 

325
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:33,940
sort of look at,
well,

326
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,700
what,
where is the power?

327
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:39,701
Really the power really is with people 
that this system works for a sort of a 

328
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:42,350
particular corporate elite,
a particular straw.

329
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I Don't know.
Politicians and bureaucrats and I hope 

330
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,341
that what the sort of cataclysms of 
recent recent news lead to is devolution

331
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,530
of power new systems because even in the
time that I've been in the country on 

332
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:56,720
this trip,
joe,

333
00:15:56,721 --> 00:16:01,721
you know,
there'd been that mad sort of massacre 

334
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:04,640
that it sort of for me is it,
and this tells me that this is a sick 

335
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:06,430
society,
not,

336
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,830
not.
Oh,

337
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,320
and britain's wonderful of course,
you know,

338
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:11,000
we went round plundering the world 
crazy,

339
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:12,440
crazy.
We've got enough problems with our own,

340
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:14,990
but like for me,
what is causing this?

341
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:16,430
Why is this hAppening?
You know,

342
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:18,080
for me,
I don't see it in isolation.

343
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:23,081
I don't believe in lone wolf.
I think the system is coughing up these 

344
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:26,390
events and there are patterns and 
there's things that we can read and 

345
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:26,390
there are things that we can change to 
improve it.

346
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,350
Certainly a part of the guy that was 
that shooter was certainly a part of our

347
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:30,520
society.
Right?

348
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,550
So if we have a set culture,
you know,

349
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,360
I mean there's,
there's eVidenCe of it.

350
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,000
I mean,
is it not,

351
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,700
it's not a completely set cultuRe.
I mean,

352
00:16:36,701 --> 00:16:38,290
we don't.
We're not all dying,

353
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,520
right?
We're not all,

354
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:43,660
we don't have all have this disease,
but some of us most certainly do.

355
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,690
So this thing that you're saying like 
that people looked at Donald Trump as a 

356
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,580
big fuck you to system the tipping over 
the apple cart.

357
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,960
I think that's absolutely what people 
were hoping for.

358
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,030
And then there's a bunch of people that 
just love saying,

359
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:57,190
fuck you.
There's a bunch of people that went,

360
00:16:57,191 --> 00:16:58,700
fuck you is flying around.
Yeah,

361
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,040
fuck you.
They just get in it.

362
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:05,041
Fuck you.
And then you're seeing a lot of that 

363
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:05,041
with Donald Trump supporters as well.

364
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,150
You're seeing people that they're 
looking for some excitement,

365
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,370
they're looking for some fun.
You're looking,

366
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,260
you're seeing people that enjoy chaos.
You know,

367
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:16,261
maybe they're trapped in cubicles and 
they're just completely frustrated by 

368
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:19,621
this fucking grind day to day grind.
Like literally being their soul,

369
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:25,030
being ground down a cheese grater every 
day,

370
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:30,270
being forced to stay under these 
fluorescent lights and it was fucking 

371
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,571
small little box dealing with human 
resources in the corporate environment 

372
00:17:33,571 --> 00:17:35,980
and they're going fucking crazy and 
anything that happens that,

373
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,110
that tips that over.
It's all fight club,

374
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:39,520
right?
They're just going to get punched in the

375
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:41,050
face.
They're looking to go crazy.

376
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,240
Then there's a lot of that as well,
you know,

377
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:48,130
but I think this chaos,
the worst parts about it,

378
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:49,200
there's no good too,
right?

379
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,040
There's no good to mass

380
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,040
shootings,
but what comes out of all these things 

381
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,801
is the discussions and the intense 
realization that we have real problems 

382
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:01,870
with real problems with the way we're 
communicating with each other and I 

383
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,271
don't necessarily know if the solution.
I mean it would certainly be a solution 

384
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:08,691
for those Involved.
If you get 100 amazing people and 

385
00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:08,691
everybody just starts a co op and Maine 
somewhere.

386
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,210
I mean,
yeah,

387
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:11,460
it'd be great for those involved.
But for,

388
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,710
for all of us,
I mean even while that,

389
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:15,900
I mean it's almost like the monastic 
lifestyle we're talking about.

390
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:18,780
If everybody just isolates,
it's all going on around you.

391
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,870
If you put your phone in a drawer and 
never use it again and you stay off the 

392
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,600
grid and you get your water from a 
spring,

393
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,840
all those people out there still 
drinking water with antidepressants in 

394
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,650
it and there's a bunch of fucking small 
and the people have to deal with.

395
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,650
There's a bunch of problems with 
hurricanes now because the water's 

396
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:36,930
warmer.
It's inevitable.

397
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,140
it's inevitable that this is all you can
decide,

398
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:45,141
hey man,
I only have 100 years in this planet 

399
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:45,141
fund this.
I'm just going to ride this out.

400
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:47,910
But if you do make a kid and you have,
and I've got a bunch of them.

401
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,800
I mean you would see what's gonna happen
to them.

402
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,690
You know what?
We have to think about what happens with

403
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:54,330
them as well were we're all this global 
community.

404
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:54,930
Really?
Yes,

405
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:59,931
we are,
and that's why I don't go for the head 

406
00:18:59,931 --> 00:18:59,970
dominique lifestyle of our fucking.
I've got a century.

407
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,510
let's line up some blowjobs.
I tried that route and that fellow john,

408
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,250
let's get a century worth of pillow 
tops.

409
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,650
Line up some blow jobs,
ice cream here,

410
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,780
brother Joe Cook because I like you 
believe in the possibility of change and

411
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,810
I've been like,
again,

412
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,830
I mentioned it again.

413
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,700
I started a podcast because you said,
you know,

414
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,840
cost and he's.
He's good fun.

415
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:31,841
Now.
What I do on mine is I get like a 

416
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:32,550
because I'm doing a university degree,
religion and global politics.

417
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,240
In fact this thing happened.
What happened to me really is I hit full

418
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,060
on a full right now I know a bunch of 
things on it.

419
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:39,240
Gonna work,
the ice cream,

420
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:40,430
the blow jobs,
the attention,

421
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,730
the privilege,
heroin,

422
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,630
crack,
all these things.

423
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:44,190
I control.
Cough is not working.

424
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:46,770
I can't control them.
I've got to find a way through this.

425
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,210
Oddly peculiarly it's a sort of a 
personal version of spirituality.

426
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,070
Yeah,
that's what I've found.

427
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:58,071
William blake,
the great english poet says each artist 

428
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:58,710
must find his own religion.
We have to find our own way.

429
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,290
What works for you is not going to be 
the same as what works for me.

430
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,060
You know,
there are ways that we're coLlective,

431
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,780
but there are ways where we are 
individually.

432
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,350
So fulbright are going to have to 
educate myself,

433
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,060
I'm going to have to do things that mean
something to me.

434
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,430
A big part of that was like write me and
doing,

435
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,960
you know,
in my own small,

436
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,180
fragile,
brittle way brazilian jujitsu go,

437
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,330
I've never done stuff like that before.
So go and live in your body being there 

438
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,010
and go genesis,
jimmy marlow and giving them a drop 

439
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:25,010
because all these guys are such big fans
of your show,

440
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,761
you know,
and I go there and I do sessions with 

441
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,621
chris,
that titanium skeleton of a man that 

442
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:31,660
twists me up and can cause paIn in ways.
That's what,

443
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,680
how was he even doing that?
And like when I try to do this stuff 

444
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:36,680
back,
it doesn't work or it puts me in my body

445
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:36,930
in a different way.

446
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,560
Learning the history of the ideas that 
we're in in religion.

447
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:41,450
The way that the,
the,

448
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,730
the distinction between politics and 
religion is an sort of an imaginary 

449
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:50,301
distinction.
When people talk about religious 

450
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:52,561
violence versus secular violence,
they're saying their violence is a 

451
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:55,401
rational and our violence is okay.
I've learned some amazing stuff in the 

452
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:56,650
last few years.
I'm the and as a result of that,

453
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,290
the kind of guests I get on my podcast 
like this guy,

454
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,860
can ross mate,
you'd love him on yours.

455
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,340
Actually,
he was a diplomat in the foreign service

456
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:06,280
around the time of the weapons of mass 
destruction and nine slash 11.

457
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,520
He believed in the system.
He's like,

458
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,330
all he wanted was to work in the foreign
service.

459
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:12,440
He knew they were lying while it was 
going on,

460
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:13,900
so he's like,
oh no.

461
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:18,901
This thing I believed in is not true.
Like he's being asked to participate in 

462
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:18,901
it.

463
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:23,880
He come out of a foreign office and 
believes that no centralized power can 

464
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:29,221
ever work.
We have to have devolved power 

465
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:29,530
assemblies.
Anarchism is the word,

466
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:34,630
and a key doesn't mean chaos.
Anarchy means devolve power to the 

467
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,570
smallest possible groups that there's no
power between you and I and jamie,

468
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,630
that we're equal in here and we should 
run the space according to what all of 

469
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,540
us think is a group that hospitals,
schools,

470
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,570
or institutions,
community should be run on a democratic 

471
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,210
basis.
You don't need to minimize the amount of

472
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:51,330
centralized or eight.
We need roads to be running,

473
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:56,340
needs to be some security and all those 
kinds of things based will be minimized 

474
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,341
where possible.
That's what this guy came away with and 

475
00:21:59,341 --> 00:21:59,920
he explained it real well to me and what
I liked the increasingly.

476
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:04,390
What I think is that when you talk about
that make the cheese grater on the soul,

477
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:04,960
that's the.

478
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,670
That's the phenomenon of the west,
you know,

479
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:11,671
that's what people in our countries are 
going through is alienation is talked 

480
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:14,620
about like in one of the things that 
navigates taught me about marxism,

481
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:18,610
that marxist theory of the way that he 
criticized and broke down capitalism,

482
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:20,890
how operates it weren't just talking 
about the economics,

483
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:23,740
so mark's was a great economist.
He goes,

484
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,280
capitalism will lead to individuals 
feeling worthless and meaningless 

485
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,280
because they'll just be cogs in the 
machine.

486
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,720
It will break people's spirits and that 
is what's happened because people sell.

487
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,930
Not the only thing that's happened go 
on.

488
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:39,070
It's also created incredible technology 
and medical innovation,

489
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,220
all sorts of different ways that we can 
make the world easier.

490
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,710
Do you think we could keep those things 
without the cheese grater soulmate?

491
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,950
Because I think we couLd think we could 
call the stuff now.

492
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,030
We could progress with it.

493
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,000
We could have different fare or ways of 
doing that and people were like,

494
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:54,670
I think people sort of kill that 
conversation too early because there's,

495
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,880
you know,
because it's working for the enough 

496
00:22:59,880 --> 00:22:59,880
people.
Yeah.

497
00:22:59,880 --> 00:22:59,880
The throwing out the baby with the 
bathwater.

498
00:22:59,880 --> 00:22:59,880
I think so,
yeah.

499
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,660
That's what the whole thing of marxism 
is the abandonment of capitalism and so 

500
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:04,660
let's go this way,
but you know,

501
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,080
you look at what happened when people 
adopted marxism and left the lead to the

502
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:10,300
death of millions and millions of people
as,

503
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:15,301
as capitalism and a lot of places we've 
been all f's but it's not reported in 

504
00:23:15,301 --> 00:23:19,501
the same way,
but I'm not saying that we will want to 

505
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:19,501
live in communist Russia or the soviet 
union or China.

506
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:20,500
Terrible,
terrible things happened there,

507
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,370
but that's what we always.
We always revert to say,

508
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,160
well,
is there not?

509
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:26,260
Is it not possible thAt we could for 
start?

510
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,330
They didn't do it properly.
They ignored it.

511
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,490
That's what everybody says,
but no one's ever done it properly.

512
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,920
I mean,
we have more freedom today.

513
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,500
Human beings have more freedom,
more freedom to behave,

514
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:40,501
more freedom to communicate,
more freedom to excel with this 

515
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:43,471
capitalist society that we're 
criticizing today than any human beings 

516
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:43,471
that have ever lived,
ever.

517
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:45,290
There's a lot of negatIve about it.
One hundred percent,

518
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:50,291
but it's also.
There's a lot of benefits and positive 

519
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:50,291
about it.
There were a lot of soulless people that

520
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:54,581
are just counting numbers and throwing 
them on a hard drive somewhere and 

521
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:54,581
buying yachts.
That's true too,

522
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:56,980
but that doesn't mean we shouldn't 
continue to evolve and inspiring.

523
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,990
I don't think evolution is finished.
I know there's loads of good things 

524
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:01,990
about capitalism buffing.
Let's carry on.

525
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,350
Let's see.
What we can do is could we be doing this

526
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:04,760
better or I believe that we could.

527
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,210
I believe that this has taken us about 
as far as it could go because of certain

528
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:13,211
ecological imperatives in this spiritual
thing that you definitely mentioned that

529
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:16,940
it's destroying the souls of a lot of 
people and it's not necessary.

530
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,140
When is that?
You know,

531
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:23,141
the war we were promised in the fifties 
and the technological revolution will 

532
00:24:23,141 --> 00:24:23,270
mean you'll work.
I have an hour a day.

533
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:28,290
You know,
like they know when delivered on that 

534
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:28,290
and people just went,
no,

535
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,640
actually you carry on fucking work in 
and we'll siphon the profit up hill and 

536
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,190
we could have leisure by societies buy.
I think that as long as there is a form 

537
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:39,221
of centralized power,
people at the center of that power will 

538
00:24:39,221 --> 00:24:40,310
not share it.
I think you have to go,

539
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,520
all right,
this community is going to be run by 

540
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,141
those people.
This community is going to be run by 

541
00:24:47,141 --> 00:24:49,181
those people and that also solves a lot 
of the other problems that are defining 

542
00:24:49,181 --> 00:24:49,490
our times of people seem to want 
different things.

543
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,550
Some people want to say absolutely no 
homosexuality.

544
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,530
Some people say,
we want total sexual freedom.

545
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:59,531
Some people want,
we want to live in what would be called 

546
00:24:59,531 --> 00:24:59,531
a religious extreme way.
Some people say atheist,

547
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:04,480
well that can't exist under one banner.
I don't think any more problem with 

548
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,021
people saying no.
Homosexuality is that they're deciding 

549
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:11,180
about freedom.
The other people's freedoms to exist for

550
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:15,410
other people's freedoms to behave and to
express themselves the way they want to,

551
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,190
and the real problem with that is a lot 
of the people that want to control other

552
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:21,020
people's freedom,
they really.

553
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:26,021
The reason why they're doing is they're 
trying to suppress their own urges and 

554
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:26,021
me.
Right.

555
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:29,980
One of the things I'm most interested in
is how much of our activity is 

556
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,370
unconscious activity so much with doing 
things.

557
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,400
We don't know why we're doing it.
The book here that I'm promoting 

558
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,660
recovery,
I written this book is my version of the

559
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,720
12 steps,
but some of it last night we were in it.

560
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Yeah.
The 12 steps is a is a journey from 

561
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,230
unconsciousness to consciousness.
That's what essentially is unconsciously

562
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,320
pursue pleasure.
You unconsciously pursue patterns 

563
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,531
because you don't know you're doing it 
if you're a smack it or a crack head 

564
00:25:53,531 --> 00:25:56,351
like me.
Eventually it gets you into such 

565
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:56,351
trouble.
You have to address it,

566
00:25:56,351 --> 00:26:00,430
but most people hover along on the 
cheese grater level lives of quiet 

567
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,640
desperation,
never realizing,

568
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,860
wait a minute.
It is possible to be happy.

569
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,740
It is possible to be contented,
move towards nature,

570
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:08,450
you while yourself doing it,
you can run.

571
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:10,490
This is what I'm good at,
this is why I'm doing a note.

572
00:26:10,491 --> 00:26:15,491
The way you run your life,
I know they will know and telling you 

573
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:15,491
what to do.
You don't want to compromise.

574
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,570
You want to learn all of this 
fascinating staff and fulfill yourself.

575
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,470
You don't want to be like,
so you've created a road for yourself to

576
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:26,471
do that,
but not everybody can and more people 

577
00:26:26,471 --> 00:26:26,780
could and I think there'll always be 
resistance.

578
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:29,390
They'll always be corrupting because 
it's in me like I don't,

579
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,510
I shouldn't spend another second 
condemning Donald Trump because I've got

580
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:35,930
an arsenal in me.
I'm a greedy person that wants attention

581
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:39,350
and wants people to love me and buy my 
book and take care of my interests.

582
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,800
You're introspective thinking has led 
you to stop that path.

583
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,430
I mean that's,
that's essentially

584
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:49,430
you.
You saw the flaws and hedonistic 

585
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,891
behavior and you hit the pause button 
you thinking about and that's very 

586
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:53,070
attractive to people because we all see 
that in ourselves.

587
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,430
You know?
And when you talk about like what what I

588
00:26:56,431 --> 00:27:01,431
do and what I've done,
the most important thing that I've ever 

589
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:01,431
done is surround myself with people that
I love.

590
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:06,070
Like I've a really good group of friends
and interesting people and that that 

591
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,700
leads to more like they find more 
interesting people.

592
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,780
It branches out and spreads out and then
people listening to this,

593
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:16,560
they become like minded.
They pursue their happiness,

594
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,230
they pursue their,
their actual desires,

595
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:20,340
what,
what interests them,

596
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,360
like what,
what,

597
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,790
what,
what they would like to do for their,

598
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,820
for their career,
for their life,

599
00:27:25,821 --> 00:27:27,120
for their,
their craft.

600
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,150
Like what do you enjoy?
Like find that thing.

601
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:32,220
Surround yourself with likeminded 
people.

602
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:37,430
And I think we all get fuel from the 
people that were around and it's one of 

603
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,271
the most underrated aspects of being a 
person in a community is if you're 

604
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:44,370
around a bunch of ambitious people who 
are creative,

605
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:48,780
who are open minded and honest,
you are inspired by that and you seek to

606
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,500
have like likeminded thought.

607
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,730
Yeah,
you're right about that.

608
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,940
I think that's another one in the 
column,

609
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,840
the against column for disappearing into
the cave.

610
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,050
And being an hmi or a monkey or 
whatever,

611
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,050
because I heard someone say,
we exist in dialectic,

612
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:05,960
which means we exist in relationship and
conversation with one another.

613
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:10,961
Who are you without other people?
You'll nobody in it in an aluminium 

614
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:13,390
capsule floating through space.
What does your personality match?

615
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,680
You know,
so you're right about that,

616
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,980
you know,
that we exist in these relationships 

617
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,811
with one another.
And I suppose what I have sought out is 

618
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:23,960
to connect with people on the level of 
the damage,

619
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,470
on the level of the wound,
on the level of the vulnerability.

620
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,990
Knowing a pessimistic that's,
you know,

621
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,620
ring ourselves out into the gut away.
No,

622
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:35,621
that's recognized that we're flawed,
but that together we can create 

623
00:28:35,621 --> 00:28:35,750
supportive,
compassionate,

624
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,820
loving communities.
And for me,

625
00:28:37,821 --> 00:28:42,821
the,
the stein point for that is a life that 

626
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:46,361
is predicated on spirituality as opposed
to materialism predicated on what my 

627
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:52,211
consciousness does.
When I stopped thinking what my 

628
00:28:52,211 --> 00:28:54,941
consciousness does when I meditate,
now I don't have the advantage of the 

629
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,350
dmt experiences in the ios got 
fascinated by it,

630
00:28:57,351 --> 00:29:00,530
listened to it.
She tried kundalini because you do that

631
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:05,570
well.
Have you ever had any sort of 

632
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:05,570
psychedelic experience through doing 
kundalini because the people that I know

633
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,801
that are really into it,
they say that they can achieve people 

634
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:12,891
that I know that I've done dmt.
I'll say they can achieve the same sort 

635
00:29:12,891 --> 00:29:12,900
of states.
Wow.

636
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,860
With kundalini.

637
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,360
Well,
they're doing it well.

638
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,420
Kundalini is one of the things I believe
in this particular toe at my finger by 

639
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,480
mark mahoney of shamrock tattoos,
los angeles.

640
00:29:21,481 --> 00:29:26,481
He's the kundalini serpent as drawn by 
called young one of the great early 

641
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:29,880
figures of psychoanalysis,
but the fire in the belly,

642
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,790
the animal energy of survival,
the energy of creativity,

643
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:38,090
the serpent energy,
the reptile energy that's deep in our 

644
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:38,090
dna.
When we were listened to,

645
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:42,291
when we were creatures that crawled on 
our belly and lives in a still can be 

646
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:42,291
the serpent,

647
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:45,370
the snake within can become crowned.
It can become royal.

648
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:50,371
Your animal desires can become royal,
and I think that the kundalini as I 

649
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,880
understand it,
is about harnessing those energies,

650
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:54,280
bringing it up.
I'd do like a yoga and I have.

651
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,620
I do have pretty tripped how experiences
where I feel like,

652
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,850
oh my god,
I'm awake,

653
00:29:57,851 --> 00:29:59,980
but I am not me.
I am not my thoughts.

654
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:02,740
I feel this sense of transcendence 90 
fold them retrospectively.

655
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:07,741
You know,
in the moment there's no me to register 

656
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:07,741
it.
It's only afterwards went,

657
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:07,990
wow,
I lost myself there.

658
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,390
Do you feel weird when you finger people
with that finger?

659
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,900
Because it does.
I know.

660
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:16,900
Don't send that snake in,
but to be honest,

661
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:21,160
fingerings are less significant.
My life finger is a very weird.

662
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:24,790
It seems so rude in the expression 
fingering.

663
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,100
It's a dirty business.
It's not functional.

664
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:32,140
No,
there's no need for it in the adult 

665
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,140
world,
but like it,

666
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,500
it's not for a lot of people love it.

667
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,490
People ask for it.
I say,

668
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:38,260
do not give them the snake combat 
reptile.

669
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:39,790
Right over open.
The shark was,

670
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,880
is this the right moment to tell you?
I dreamt about you last night knowing 

671
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,090
it's a risk always to tell someone that 
you dreamt about them because once it's 

672
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:48,310
out there,
it's out there.

673
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:49,570
So and particularly,
you know,

674
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,120
check it out.
So we were in this dream.

675
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:57,121
We're in some sort of semi organic 
forest type world,

676
00:30:57,341 --> 00:31:02,341
but they had an industrial component,
somewhat labyrinthian makers that 

677
00:31:02,341 --> 00:31:04,480
component like that as if you know,
like the,

678
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:06,760
he walks how they've made the most of 
the woods,

679
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:08,620
you know,
to build little huts and stuff and maybe

680
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:13,621
they'll have a little.
I don't know if the walks have another 

681
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:13,621
couple of thousand years,
maybe a little.

682
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,200
He was trained.
I don't know what they would have done.

683
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,700
Who knows?
They were lovely,

684
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:16,630
cuddly little guys.

685
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,040
So anyway,
there was a solvent.

686
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:23,041
It is small industrial component to it.
We were somewhere within that world and 

687
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:25,900
we were doing brazilian jujitsu.
That's used the word rolling.

688
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,260
Now there was a sort of,
this is how we know is a dream cause 

689
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:31,260
there was a moment where I had you 
inside control.

690
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,310
Now from that moment I moved towards 
choke and you did something where you 

691
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,630
arched and flipped over.
Very acrobatic and very elegantly don't 

692
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,210
even know if it's an actual move or not.
It was very,

693
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:41,740
very beautiful and a for ah,
right there.

694
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:44,020
This spa,
we're going quite well this rolling,

695
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:48,070
but it seems that joe rogan is better at
brazilian jujitsu than me,

696
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:53,130
but that even in the dream world that 
seemed like something kaiden 

697
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:53,130
understanding of,
well,

698
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:53,130
there's

699
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:58,910
so what's brilliant about it and what's 
interesting about it is that the more 

700
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,430
time you put into it,
the more you understand the moves,

701
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:03,340
the more moves you require,
the more moves you drill,

702
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,760
the better you get at it,
the more it's literally like a language 

703
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,370
and that as your vocabulary increases 
and your ability to like.

704
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:17,230
Even if your vocabulary is very broad,
if you don't talk a lot,

705
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,990
he'd probably have stumbling 
conversations.

706
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:24,991
Right?
But if you get used to talking all the 

707
00:32:24,991 --> 00:32:25,960
time and you're having a conversation 
with someone and the words kind of flow,

708
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:30,961
but if you're talking to someone and 
they're weird and they bark out things 

709
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:31,690
and they talk over you,
it's,

710
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,190
it's awkward.
And herky jerky,

711
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,400
much like jujitsu.
Jujitsu is almost like a Connecticut 

712
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,710
language,
but there is a puzzle that's solved,

713
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:41,720
right?
And there's a problem,

714
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:42,860
right?
And this person's.

715
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,880
the problem is this person is trying to 
apply all these different techniques,

716
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:51,881
whether they're chokes or joint locks on
you and you are trying to both defend 

717
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:54,140
that and then put it on.
You put yours on them.

718
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,170
It's beautiful.
I've heard you say before,

719
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,180
high pressure problem solving or mma.
I always describe as high level problem 

720
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:06,420
solving with dire physical consequences.
Physical clickers,

721
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:11,470
mma is the most,
the most high level of all the problem 

722
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,070
solving because there's the consequences
are so grave getting kicked in the head,

723
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:15,980
getting elbowed and kneed like those 
things are so.

724
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,640
Jujitsu I think is better for you for 
sure physically because the consequences

725
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,350
are not nearly as grave.
You get choked out,

726
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:25,970
you're fine.
You get your arm,

727
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,200
you know,
you tap out.

728
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:27,980
If your lungs,
you're,

729
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:28,970
you're,
you have.

730
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,580
As long as you're willing to tap out,
you have to be willing to tap.

731
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,260
Now you'll,
you'll get through it.

732
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,370
Okay,
and if you get injured,

733
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:37,050
you just get it fixed and take six 
months off,

734
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:42,051
she'll be back.
I like that connect language thing you 

735
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:44,741
said.
That really makes sense to me because I 

736
00:33:44,741 --> 00:33:44,741
feel like when I'm doing it,
I'm not going.

737
00:33:44,741 --> 00:33:45,130
Hello?
Yeah.

738
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:50,790
Show me the way to the train door door.

739
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,970
People that are like punch me in the 
right direction.

740
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,560
You go thousand ways.
Why exactly do you watch jujitsu?

741
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:01,960
It all online?
No,

742
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,970
I don't watch those,
but sometimes I look at videos of named 

743
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:06,970
grace.
He's or something and they're effortless

744
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:11,950
capacities and charisma.
You should watch just because you're 

745
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,071
enjoying it.
Watch like current top of the food 

746
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:15,520
chain,
jujitsu guys like hoffa mendez,

747
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:16,220
you know,
watch some.

748
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,840
Marcello garcia watched some,
you know,

749
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,920
some of the young guys coming up.
Gary tone and it's fascinating to watch 

750
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,120
them apply these new strategies to this 
old language,

751
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:31,150
you know,
because that's really essentially what 

752
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,651
it is.
I mean what you're seeing is these new 

753
00:34:32,651 --> 00:34:33,110
approaches.
Jujitsu is this never ending thing.

754
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,120
I mean it really just doesn't.
It doesn't.

755
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:40,150
The the like boxing,
although it's very complex and it 

756
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,470
doesn't seem as complex to someone on 
the outside,

757
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:47,740
but When you watch like a guy like floyd
mayweather or sugar ray leonard or 

758
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,260
someone who's just a master at their 
craft,

759
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:50,450
which you use see how complex it truly 
is.

760
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:53,750
You see all the different,
the all the different nuances to it,

761
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,310
but it's still punching,
right?

762
00:34:55,311 --> 00:35:00,311
There's just still too punching.
Whereas jujitsu is this fucking tangle 

763
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:02,900
of bodies and possibilities and 
potential.

764
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,510
There's so many different ways to 
approach it.

765
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:08,360
There's people that are chokers.
There's people that are armed lock guys.

766
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:10,370
There's people that are.
They like to get you with their legs,

767
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:15,371
their triangle people,
and they all have their own little way 

768
00:35:15,371 --> 00:35:18,161
of approaching this conversation,
so you've learned a few sort of 

769
00:35:18,161 --> 00:35:19,250
grammatical pathways,
fruit that kinetic language and think,

770
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:20,350
right,
I'm going to mf that.

771
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:23,030
That particular area,
so watching videos online,

772
00:35:23,031 --> 00:35:24,870
it's like watching a video of Alan Watts
talking.

773
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,760
You go,
oh,

774
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,880
okay.
TerenCe mckenna or timothy leary or 

775
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,361
whoever it is that you think is 
fascinating when you hear them talk and 

776
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:36,260
it develops new pathways and 
possibilities for your own thinking.

777
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,960
and it was one of the things I was gonna
say earlier though,

778
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:38,300
we,
we,

779
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,900
when,
what I was thinking while we were having

780
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:44,901
this conversation about the future and 
about possibilities and about 

781
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:48,380
civilization that you,
with all due respect what you and I are 

782
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:48,380
doing,
both of us were.

783
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,790
This is a very rudimentary way of trying
to figure this out.

784
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,720
I think were,
were,

785
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,200
were clubbing at it,
you know,

786
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:59,730
and I think people are listening to this
that will do a far better job than us in

787
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:00,580
the future.
Yeah.

788
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,390
And I think that that's important and I 
think that we're doing our best,

789
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:04,170
you know,
we're taking our tests,

790
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:09,171
but when Henry Ford created the model t,
he didn't intend it to race against the 

791
00:36:09,171 --> 00:36:09,540
la ferrari.
You know,

792
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,430
he didn't know what the fuck a la 
ferrari was,

793
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:16,550
but if he didn't make that model t the 
la ferrari and wouldn't have been 

794
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:16,550
possible.

795
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,640
But you can't go back and go,
Henry Ford fucking suck,

796
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:22,641
dude,
ride this piece of shit with its leaf 

797
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:22,641
springs at stupid tires,
you know,

798
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:26,160
and then get into 2017 corvette zr one.
You go,

799
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:27,150
whoa,
okay,

800
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:30,900
this is where it's at now.
It's like all these things have to be in

801
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:33,810
place for the next evolution of it to 
advance,

802
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:39,020
and I think we're,
we're looking at today with our society 

803
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,960
is we're hoping that there's a solution 
out there were the,

804
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,360
there is a solution,
but it's god damn slow.

805
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,360
Just like all evolution.
It's god damn slow.

806
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:48,900
It's faster than single celled organisms
to a giraffe,

807
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,980
but it's still fucking slow and we're a 
part of it.

808
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,570
All of us,
not just you and I,

809
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:59,571
but the people that are listening to 
this and the people that are having 

810
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:01,821
their own podcasts,
their own conversations and doing ted 

811
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:03,570
talks and writing books.
We're all apart of thinking this out and

812
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:08,571
these little pieces all fit together 
slowly but surely and create this mosaic

813
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:13,881
of ideas and potential.
And what we're experiencing now is just 

814
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:18,141
what we can experience in this realm.
Like in this world with this life that 

815
00:37:18,141 --> 00:37:22,341
we're currently stuck in and then 
someone 50 years from now we'll be 

816
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:24,990
looking back at our stumbling 
conversation,

817
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:29,991
trying to figure out a way to engineer 
society correctly and they'll have a 

818
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:29,991
much better way of doing it.

819
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:31,710
I Think that's a very beautiful 
progressive argument.

820
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:36,110
I agree with much of what you've said 
except some adequate joe.

821
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:41,330
Even things I've heard on this podcast 
say when you have graham hancock or a 

822
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:45,560
particularly intuitive when you got them
more sanctioned academic guy on there 

823
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,810
and they felt like,
you know,

824
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,090
you know,
you bastard.

825
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,290
You're the people that I love that

826
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,290
such a rebel,
you know,

827
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:57,291
it's,
it's fascinating to see these people 

828
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,500
know,
attacking him for his ideas and his 

829
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,581
research,
but now having less and less ground 

830
00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:03,921
stand on.
Graham's ideas had been more proven in 

831
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:05,100
the last 10,
20 years than ever before the case.

832
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,280
Finding these new civilizations and 
finding these new evidence that human 

833
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,451
beings have existed on this continent 
far longer and that they're traveling 

834
00:38:14,451 --> 00:38:14,790
all over the world for far longer and 
the civilization,

835
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:16,070
it's probably quite a bit.
Okay.

836
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:20,400
Than we thought that's right,
and so we don't therefore know that this

837
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,990
idea of continual progression,
linear progression is the only one.

838
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,310
It is possible that when it comes to the
realm of consciousness,

839
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:34,670
ancient people knew something that we 
are struggling to understand that and I,

840
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:36,270
I

841
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:41,270
recognize that your model t to ferrari 
metaphor is a good one and actually 

842
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:47,761
speaking to young people now,
I do feel that they're kind of more 

843
00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:47,761
switched on.
Geez,

844
00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:51,670
look at a baby With an ipad.
It seems lIke they know already and,

845
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,500
and,
but what I feel is,

846
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,660
and this might just be my personal 
narcissism,

847
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:58,720
but I like to think of myself as the 
pinnacle of consciousness.

848
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:01,330
That there isn't some other realm.
Even though god,

849
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:03,160
I want that dmt so bad.
Like,

850
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,200
why are you afraid of that?
Because it's not.

851
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:10,230
It's not a like,
it's not an intoxicant because I'm a 12 

852
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,380
step guy and I'm a sobriety shit.
Stop other 12 step that you're not going

853
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:16,060
to fuckIng book about that fucking 
promote.

854
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,480
You're not going to fall slip addiction.
It's not this idea that you're going to 

855
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,320
fall apart and become a junkie again.

856
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:28,320
It's not going to happen.
That part of her is that you can say 

857
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,591
that joe,
but also a in an integral part of my 

858
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:35,221
recovery is the idea of surrender and I 
think that's an integral part of a lot 

859
00:39:35,221 --> 00:39:36,580
of spiritual beliefs and internal part 
of dmt.

860
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,160
Yeah,
I feel you,

861
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:44,161
man,
but like to bypass the idea of my egoic 

862
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:47,910
offer ship my egoic or flurry of I'm 
russell and this is what I believe and 

863
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,090
this is what I'm going to do.
I've surrendered to a way of life.

864
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,750
I've surrendered.
If I can find some people with 25,

865
00:39:51,751 --> 00:39:54,970
thIrty years in recovery,
clean time that go.

866
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,430
You're allowed to take the empty.
I'm like fucking hammered a pipe.

867
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:03,450
You don't need there.
There isn't a face or they're 

868
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:03,450
sanctioning.
Well,

869
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,960
in a way I learned by the way,
you don't even need dmt.

870
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,130
No.
You don't need it,

871
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:07,270
but you seem like you want it.

872
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,880
Yeah,
because I love the transcendent.

873
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:14,970
I love it because I've know and I've 
always known that this experience of 

874
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,120
being in a body,
in the conscious,

875
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,150
individualistic mind,
and remember I've taken loads of acid 

876
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:21,760
when I was a kid as well.
I know that this is not all of it.

877
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:26,790
This is just we're just reading one 
bandwidth of data with our century 

878
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,410
instruments that there is limitless 
consciousness and limitless reality.

879
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,170
Do you miss that asked experience?
Yes,

880
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,170
I do.
I.

881
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,960
I love it.
I love it.

882
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,990
Is the concern that if you fell into it 
like whether it was mushrooms or 

883
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,831
whatever it is,
that if you fell into that experience 

884
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:46,711
again,
that it would lead you in a downward 

885
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:47,200
spiral of addiction in a sense.
It's that in a sense,

886
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:52,201
it's that and the fact is as well,
I've turned my life around or my life 

887
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,180
has been turned around by this program,
by this system and like,

888
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,590
you know,
the,

889
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,590
the 12 seven,
it does have something in it.

890
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,200
That's quite what I want to say.
Like I said,

891
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:03,210
little bit.
Ascetic is a little thing like it's 

892
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:03,210
about the nile,
Right?

893
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,601
Because,
but the reason that I've written this 

894
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:06,601
book was an interpretation to 12 steps,
excuse me,

895
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:11,070
it's because I think it's a masterpiece 
I think is a masterpiece at a time when 

896
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:14,101
people are struggling with ideologies,
a tIme when people are struggling with 

897
00:41:14,101 --> 00:41:15,940
religion because the bad things about 
religion is so obvious,

898
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:20,941
the bigotry and the violence,
those things are so clear to us even 

899
00:41:20,941 --> 00:41:24,001
though there are many,
many beautiful things about islam and 

900
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:24,330
many beautiful things about christianity
are focused,

901
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,690
tends to turn on the bigotry and the 
hatred that is present it or used out of

902
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:33,691
those ideologies.
The 12 steps is accessible to anybody 

903
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:34,340
and can be used

904
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,450
as a code to unravel your connection to 
your own individual experience,

905
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,000
your own self centerdness,
your own self obsession.

906
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:46,001
Now this might not be a problem that you
have that this might be the line that 

907
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:46,001
separates us.
Me,

908
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:50,600
I'm self obsessed and I have the first 
league like this is hoW it works.

909
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:55,601
One,
you admit there's something that you 

910
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:55,601
want to change and like that could be 
I'm a smack head,

911
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:59,470
pretty obvious then,
or you're a sex addict and that's a 

912
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,871
harder thing to admit because it can be 
rewarding if you're into adult human 

913
00:42:01,871 --> 00:42:05,111
females in a culture like I was,
but if he ultimately leaves you lonely 

914
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:08,981
and unable to have a family and you feel
like you're having a negative emotional 

915
00:42:08,981 --> 00:42:11,090
effect on others and yourself,
then you need to admit it's a problem.

916
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,990
The secoNd thing is could your life be 
better and the of course it could,

917
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:19,991
and the third thing is being willing to 
accept help from others and whether 

918
00:42:19,991 --> 00:42:22,580
that's a community or from your 
understanding of a higher power.

919
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:27,670
Now I happen to have,
I believe in god in the sense that I 

920
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,881
believe that there's limitless 
consciousness that my individual 

921
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:30,881
consciousness is connected to something 
that I can't understand,

922
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,020
that no one can ever understand.
And again,

923
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,410
as I've heard on one of my own podcast,
as a matter of fact,

924
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:38,690
yanis varoufakis who lived this 
political movement in Greece.

925
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,300
He said,
we will never know whether consciousness

926
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:46,301
proceeded matter or matter,
proceeded consciousness and in a way 

927
00:42:46,301 --> 00:42:48,260
it's irrelevant now because spirit,
this quality is here.

928
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,920
It's here and it's a big pile of what 
human beings are and it isn't dealt with

929
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:55,550
by consumerism and it isn't dealt with 
by contemporary politics.

930
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:57,620
People don't talk about love,
kindness,

931
00:42:57,621 --> 00:43:00,380
togetherness there,
but these are the dominant things in our

932
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:01,940
lives.
That's What's most important to me.

933
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:03,260
The people that I love,
like you said,

934
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:04,310
the connections with the people.

935
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:09,310
You have to become your reality,
but a political system that reduces you 

936
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,350
to a component of an economic machine is
never going to fulfill you.

937
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:17,351
So what I now believe is that by what I 
think this book and do is give people a 

938
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:22,451
guide to reach in their own spiritual 
truth because it's completely non 

939
00:43:22,451 --> 00:43:26,420
prescriptive.
It's like your version of god is going 

940
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,571
to be different from mine.
Your personal inventory that you draw 

941
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:28,730
up,
we will reveal the truths of the way you

942
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,320
see the world and the problems you've 
made.

943
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:35,530
The communIties that you belong to will 
support you and you can change your 

944
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:35,960
patterns,
you can make amends for your past,

945
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:40,961
you can continue to stay present,
and a vital part of this program is 

946
00:43:40,961 --> 00:43:44,321
prayer and meditation,
continued connection to the moments you 

947
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:45,260
don't lose yourself in your past or the 
projections of your future.

948
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:50,770
Now,
whether or not that prohibits me from 

949
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:51,350
experimenting with psychedelics in the 
long term.

950
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:56,650
you know,
for me the jury's out because I do want 

951
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:56,650
to.
And bill wilson,

952
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:59,681
the guy who founded these fellowships 
was fascinated by asset and subsequent 

953
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:03,310
like even when he was so bad,
it took a lot of acid and I think that 

954
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:03,310
guy was a prophet.
He was on a mission.

955
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,420
He was trying to discover what is truth,
what is reality?

956
00:44:06,421 --> 00:44:10,850
We discussed much in the 12 step program
though is because I think it's like most

957
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:12,410
things,
it becomes orthodox.

958
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:13,610
You know,
like most religions,

959
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:18,611
most systems in the end they become 
orthodox and it does such a good job at 

960
00:44:18,611 --> 00:44:20,540
helping with its primary purpose of 
stopping people,

961
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:21,950
being alcoholic,
stopping people,

962
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:26,951
being drug addicts.
That's such an amazing job and it's 

963
00:44:26,951 --> 00:44:26,951
doing that job and it should continue to
do that job well.

964
00:44:26,951 --> 00:44:31,640
I feel like I wanted to do is extract 
the thing that I think is amazing about 

965
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:31,640
it and say,
oh my god,

966
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,560
anyone could use this.
Do you hear this again and again from 

967
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:36,560
people that have got long time pro clean
in these programs,

968
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,420
everyone should work this program.
EveryoNe should know what is the impact 

969
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:41,580
cause your mom treated you tHat way or 
your dad,

970
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,430
they saw associate at intuit score.
You were abused.

971
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,500
You are still carrying it in your 
consciousness.

972
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:48,000
We've touched on it a moment ago,
joe,

973
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,300
if you're like I say this,
you don't choose between having a 

974
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,301
program and not having a program.
You choose between having a conscious 

975
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:59,031
program and an unconscious program.
If you're not working in a conscious 

976
00:44:59,031 --> 00:45:00,270
program,
you are being worked by your unconscious

977
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:01,560
program.
This is what I do.

978
00:45:01,561 --> 00:45:03,810
If a man makes me feel intimidated,
this is what I do.

979
00:45:03,811 --> 00:45:05,550
If a woman makes me feel like I'm 
important,

980
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,070
this is what I do.
If I have a bad day program,

981
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:08,940
program,
program,

982
00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:10,920
the program of your class,
the program of your school,

983
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:12,000
your family,
your culture,

984
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:17,001
your time,
and this 12 step system can be buggy 

985
00:45:17,001 --> 00:45:18,090
from it and it's not anybody else 
telling you what to do because it's your

986
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:20,730
own version of a higher power.
It's your own version of a truth,

987
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,760
except it's guided by the idea,
become free,

988
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:28,790
connect to who you really are,
and become benevolent and loving to 

989
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:28,790
others.

990
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:33,000
You know what I'm thing?
Is it really important that you said 

991
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,701
earlier about there's no political 
system or no,

992
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,040
no politicians that are talking about 
love and values and caring and a sense 

993
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,871
of community.
I think that's the solution to what 

994
00:45:44,871 --> 00:45:46,740
we're fearing about brexit and Donald 
Trump and the rise of,

995
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:51,770
you know,
the just this attorney of the apple 

996
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:51,770
card,
this,

997
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:55,380
this thing that people are seeing right 
now that they don't like and this,

998
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:56,070
this,
this,

999
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:59,170
the hateful rhetoric that people are 
most disturbed about,

1000
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,420
particularly with brexit.
Right?

1001
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:05,421
That's like the big thing that people 
are really disturbed about is that it 

1002
00:46:05,421 --> 00:46:05,880
was fueled by this fear of the other.
Yes.

1003
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:10,900
That's right,
but isn't it possible that the when if 

1004
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,330
people decided that that didn't work 
out,

1005
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:17,331
whether it's brexit or trump,
that the response to that would be the 

1006
00:46:17,331 --> 00:46:21,471
rise of this ideology,
the rise of someone who's going to talk 

1007
00:46:21,471 --> 00:46:23,580
about love and community and someone 
who's going to be genuine.

1008
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:26,730
I mean we don't have that person now,
but it doesn't mean that that person can

1009
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:29,600
exist and we've only had 45 different 
presidents we had.

1010
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,620
We haven't had any,
every single version of what's possible 

1011
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,880
for a human being to be interfacing with
the entire civilization of the United 

1012
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,690
States of America.
I think it's pretty clear that what that

1013
00:46:39,691 --> 00:46:44,691
system delivers.
I think that those power systems are 

1014
00:46:44,691 --> 00:46:44,760
evolving in this direction.
I think that this is,

1015
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,920
if not the pinnacle,
I think it's possible that there are 

1016
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,011
better versions of a president,
but I think that systems that at that 

1017
00:46:52,011 --> 00:46:52,110
centralized will always deliver 
inequality.

1018
00:46:52,111 --> 00:46:55,560
I think it's impossible for them not to 
and I think that they should be evolved,

1019
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,450
altered,
devolved in a in a sense,

1020
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,210
but I do agree.
One of the things that in the I think is

1021
00:47:02,211 --> 00:47:05,480
positive about cataclysm in politics,
if something like brexit,

1022
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,010
when brexit happened,
when trump happened,

1023
00:47:07,011 --> 00:47:08,390
I felt this sort of.
I'm a bit,

1024
00:47:08,391 --> 00:47:11,260
I'm eric know I'm a dharma mccormick.
I live in mischief,

1025
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:15,140
I live in the madness.
That's just behind reality and I've been

1026
00:47:15,141 --> 00:47:16,340
away.
This is good.

1027
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:19,790
Not for the people's lives will be 
negatively effective when we've seen the

1028
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:23,750
rise of divisive politics and like kinda
softened quite old fashioned ideas about

1029
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:26,060
sort of ethno nationalism and that kind 
of stuff.

1030
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,670
But the good thing is it precisely as 
you say,

1031
00:47:28,671 --> 00:47:33,671
joe,
that it does open the conversation up 

1032
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:33,671
for someone to say,
oh,

1033
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:37,230
hold on a minute.
I think we've just left out love 

1034
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:37,230
kindness,
unity,

1035
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,530
togetherness,
like these things perhaps people will be

1036
00:47:38,531 --> 00:47:39,930
open to.
Whereas I think if,

1037
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,800
you know,
if we'd stayed in the european union,

1038
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,870
if we'd had hillary clinton as 
president,

1039
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,320
things is a bit more business as usual.
We're not forced with.

1040
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,750
We're not staring into the face of 
madness.

1041
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:51,880
We're not forced to address.
Things are going wrong.

1042
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,020
You know,
I talked to my friends sturgeon,

1043
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,770
a dental sturgill simpson,
the musician.

1044
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:02,900
He a brilliant musician and he sent me 
this text message of a conversation that

1045
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:07,910
he had with dr rick strassman.
Dr rick strassman as the guy out of the 

1046
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,220
university of New Mexico ran those 
clinical tests on dmt,

1047
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:11,660
wrote the book,
dmt,

1048
00:48:11,661 --> 00:48:16,661
the spirit molecule,
but he was quoting when he was talking 

1049
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:18,320
about the times that we live in and how 
fucked up everything is.

1050
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:21,830
He was quoting this,
I forget,

1051
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:27,010
I think it was a monk who said this,
that we are constantly in a fight 

1052
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:31,120
between 49 point nine percent and 50 
point one percent good and evil and that

1053
00:48:34,491 --> 00:48:39,491
they fluctuate back and forth and that 
we feel like we are just like a speck of

1054
00:48:42,201 --> 00:48:47,201
dust because we are both a speck of dust
and the most important thing in the 

1055
00:48:48,381 --> 00:48:48,740
world.

1056
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:53,980
Because the.
The actions of one individual literally 

1057
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,460
can influence the course of the human 
race.

1058
00:48:55,461 --> 00:49:00,461
The course of our civilization and that 
this period of flux is what creates 

1059
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:03,200
growth and change and that the tipping 
of the apple cart and the.

1060
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:08,201
The,
the positive thing about having someone 

1061
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:09,881
like Donald Trump,
and I don't like Donald Trump more than 

1062
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:09,881
I like hillary clinton,
I didn't like either one of them,

1063
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:15,050
hillary clinton represented to me was 
this lifelong politician who didn't 

1064
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:18,170
support gay marriage until 2013,
which she was to me.

1065
00:49:18,171 --> 00:49:20,570
What she represented to me was an 
obvious magician,

1066
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:25,690
someone who I could see them pulling the
cards out on their sleeve and I'm 

1067
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:29,321
supposed to not pay attention.
It's bullshit and what he represents is 

1068
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:33,851
the ego unfettered in figuring out with 
crazy hair and a family in the middle 

1069
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:40,210
sands and the whole deal.
It's just this chaos ego putting his 

1070
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:44,230
name on buildings and then we're 
realizing that both of these are 

1071
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:44,230
terrible options.

1072
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,880
System is a terrible system.
This way.

1073
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:52,910
When we have what's essentially a 
popularity contest to see who controls 

1074
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:53,750
nuclear weapons,
it's insane.

1075
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:59,410
It's literally insane and that the only 
way this is going to change is by having

1076
00:49:59,421 --> 00:50:04,421
this incredibly upsetting moment for 
everybody where they're looking around 

1077
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:04,421
going,
what the fuck is going on?

1078
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:09,730
And then new ideas get introduced and I 
don't know what those new ideas are 

1079
00:50:10,191 --> 00:50:15,191
going to be or who's going to introduce 
them or how someone is gonna come along 

1080
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:19,871
within the next three years and 
challenge this current system in a way 

1081
00:50:19,871 --> 00:50:22,820
that's appealing,
not just to the right and to the left,

1082
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:26,120
but maybe in some way to just human 
beings.

1083
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:31,180
Maybe in some way human beings,
They realize like what's what's we're 

1084
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:34,551
not going to get by in this world by 
enforcing right wing politics and ideas 

1085
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:40,241
and and,
and this sort of ideology or left wing 

1086
00:50:40,241 --> 00:50:44,140
ideas and politics ideology,
but freedom and love and community and 

1087
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:48,410
to be free to practice your own level of
conservatism on your own.

1088
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:53,520
But the idea that I don't want any gays 
and want to have a little tribe were no 

1089
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,440
gays are allowed.
That seems to me to be counterproductive

1090
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:56,440
and that seems to be the counter 
revolutionary.

1091
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:02,060
All of that idea.
Any suppressing of people's individual 

1092
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,060
right to express themselves.

1093
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:06,710
Sure.
I agree with almost everything you said 

1094
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:07,330
there and I've got a sense of been 
involved in academia.

1095
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:09,120
Do you know one of the main changes or 
make notes?

1096
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,190
Oh,
well,

1097
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,420
yeah.
Notes now.

1098
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,800
I never would have dreamt to that when I
was a younger man.

1099
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:15,450
Excellent.
Native beginning.

1100
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,930
You talked about this idea of the 
fitbit,

1101
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:18,170
the percent aisle,
you know,

1102
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:23,240
good and evil that couldn't even now 
there's a great quote by the rational 

1103
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,660
for sultanates and the line between good
and evil runs not between creeds,

1104
00:51:24,661 --> 00:51:27,690
religions and empires,
but through every human heart.

1105
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So nice quote for that quote now,
and he's a personal theory that the 

1106
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,310
reason that I dollar tree is bad,
like they becomes like an in most 

1107
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,641
religions say don't worship individuals 
is precisely because they understand 

1108
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:42,960
that don't make one individual have too 
much power.

1109
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:48,170
Even now,
historically we know that gandy had 

1110
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:48,170
skeletons in the closet.

1111
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:48,170
Great.
Great gandy,

1112
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:52,690
wonderful.
Great hero of bringing down the british 

1113
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:52,690
empire,
bringing it about freedom and love.

1114
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:57,590
Interestingly,
gandy said there's no point ass kicking 

1115
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:58,110
the british out of India and then 
replicate in their systems.

1116
00:51:58,111 --> 00:52:00,180
This is a country of 70,000
villages.

1117
00:52:00,181 --> 00:52:05,181
These 70,000
visitors villages are or should be 

1118
00:52:05,181 --> 00:52:06,540
autonomous run on their own craft or 
craft economies,

1119
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:11,541
trade with one another only in access,
so like he was trying to get like 

1120
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:12,350
important ideas out there,
but like,

1121
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,790
like your great civil rights leaders,
malcolm x,

1122
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:16,870
martin luther king,
these are men that had flow.

1123
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,740
Malcolm x did prison time for unusual 
shit,

1124
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:21,450
but Dr.
King,

1125
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:23,220
you know,
extra marrow of stuff.

1126
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,930
People are not perfect.
They're great hero.

1127
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:29,520
Pioneer people are people.
So we have to change this.

1128
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:34,610
What I think is is that we can't have a 
popularity contest to decide who's in 

1129
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,370
charge of nuclear weapons.

1130
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,430
These kinds of systems need to be 
devolved because it's mental.

1131
00:52:38,431 --> 00:52:39,340
We know that.
Exactly.

1132
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:42,900
I agree with your analysis of hillary 
clinton and Donald Trump entirely.

1133
00:52:42,901 --> 00:52:47,901
I think that the reason that you have a 
mad option like Donald Trump being 

1134
00:52:47,901 --> 00:52:48,660
successful,
it's when people had had enough of those

1135
00:52:48,661 --> 00:52:51,660
cheap tricks and cards up sleeves and 
financial corruption.

1136
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:55,320
So yeah,
the apple carts going over chaos too.

1137
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:57,900
I agree,
is an important part of evolution.

1138
00:52:57,901 --> 00:53:00,990
We rest on chaos.
These patterns that we observe,

1139
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:06,030
just temporary or show their sort of a 
cult leader and sort of poetic figure 

1140
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:12,230
leader said,
we talk about civilization as if it's 

1141
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,981
this great thing.
What is civilization a clearing in the 

1142
00:53:15,981 --> 00:53:15,981
forest?
You know,

1143
00:53:15,981 --> 00:53:18,720
for a moment we create our cities in the
forest closes in and has it again.

1144
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:22,350
We're all theSe ancient civilization.
Graham hancock talked about,

1145
00:53:22,351 --> 00:53:24,370
so lucidly,
where are they now?

1146
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,520
It up by the amazon

1147
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:31,320
and I think great quote in a herman 
melville's moby dick that says,

1148
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,810
you know,
noah's flood is still happening.

1149
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:38,811
We are.
The majority of the earth is still 

1150
00:53:38,811 --> 00:53:38,811
flooded in war.
These,

1151
00:53:38,811 --> 00:53:41,670
we are connected to these events.
We are out there in that chaos.

1152
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,320
So I suppose,
gosh,

1153
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:45,450
what I'm trying to say here,
joe,

1154
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,180
is that when we recognize that we're all
flawed,

1155
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,250
that we're all fallible,
we have to sort of thing.

1156
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:55,420
We have to think,
how can we build systems that tend 

1157
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:55,620
towards the better aspects of our 
nature,

1158
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:00,650
not the worst aspects of our nature.
Can we recognize that any politician in 

1159
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:02,340
a position of power for too long we will
make mistakes,

1160
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:07,370
will be floored.
That power has to be spread out as much 

1161
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,810
as possible and as close to the people 
that it affects as as is feasible.

1162
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,820
Yeah.
There's always going to be an issue with

1163
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:15,540
someone being able to acquire 
$100,000,000,000

1164
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:18,710
like the amazon,
Jeff Bezos guy like that,

1165
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,550
that is going to corrupt people.
It was like,

1166
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,280
why would you?
First of all,

1167
00:54:23,281 --> 00:54:28,281
why would you keep working?
Why would you want that amount of money 

1168
00:54:28,281 --> 00:54:28,281
and what's your plan?
What's your end game?

1169
00:54:28,281 --> 00:54:28,650
You're trying to make the world a better
place.

1170
00:54:28,651 --> 00:54:32,460
You're going to try to acquire more 
brown boxes with your logo on them.

1171
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:33,290
I mean,
what do you.

1172
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:33,930
What are you doing?

1173
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:35,380
Where's,
where's it going?

1174
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:37,630
And it seems to me that there's a game,
right?

1175
00:54:37,631 --> 00:54:40,480
Everybody plays this game.
Some people play it for $10 an hour.

1176
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,600
Some people play it for $10,000,000,000
a year and that once you make 

1177
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:45,600
$10,000,000,000
a year,

1178
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,130
you want infinite growth.
You want 11 next year?

1179
00:54:48,131 --> 00:54:53,131
I would like to tell my stockholders 
that we have caused to celebrate and we 

1180
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,450
have 20 percent increase in our,
uh,

1181
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,310
bottom line this year and everybody's 
looking good.

1182
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,450
Let's go to tahiti.
Right?

1183
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,090
And then like where,
what are you doing?

1184
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:03,310
You can't,
this is not going to last.

1185
00:55:03,311 --> 00:55:04,720
You're not going to live forever.
Like what?

1186
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,030
What is the end game?
Well,

1187
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,260
there's no end game.
You're caught up in the current game,

1188
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,330
in the current game.
They are literally,

1189
00:55:10,331 --> 00:55:15,331
capitalists are literally living in the 
moment because you have to just 

1190
00:55:15,331 --> 00:55:19,360
stockpiling shit that they're not 
thinking about the overall objective,

1191
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:22,330
you know,
a sky down looking from the,

1192
00:55:22,331 --> 00:55:23,590
you know,
looking from the heavens

1193
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:25,330
down on earth like what the fuck are we 
doing?

1194
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:30,360
They're not thinking about that.
Nor are they accepting that limitless 

1195
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,271
growth is literally impossible.
That we have finite resources on a 

1196
00:55:33,271 --> 00:55:33,430
finite planet,

1197
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:39,250
not for me.
It's also you get caught up in the 

1198
00:55:39,411 --> 00:55:41,810
momentum of whatever you're doing,
you know,

1199
00:55:41,811 --> 00:55:46,811
whatever you're doing,
you just get caught up in it and you 

1200
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:46,811
know,
you.

1201
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:47,930
If you're doing something and you're 
trying to get better at it,

1202
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:52,931
whether it's make a better paintings or 
acquire more wealth like you these 

1203
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:56,840
requests and you try to get better at 
these quests,

1204
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:57,500
you know,
and that's,

1205
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,520
that's,
that's a real issue with human beings 

1206
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,650
and I think it has evolutionary roots.
I think it has roots in our,

1207
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:08,890
our,
our need and desire to make better 

1208
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:09,230
structures and shelters to make better 
weapons,

1209
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:14,231
to make a better civilization so that we
can stay alive longer so that we can 

1210
00:56:14,231 --> 00:56:15,230
ensure that our children will be alive 
longer.

1211
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:20,590
I think there's roots in that that are 
sort of just sort of bastardized and 

1212
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:26,081
twisted in this world of ideas where,
where you're talking about like money 

1213
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:30,691
and and and,
and stocks and bonds and mutual funds 

1214
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:33,160
and hedge funds and it's like jesus,
like it's,

1215
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,950
it's almost like we have these ancient 
instincts for,

1216
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,960
for constant improvement that just,
they,

1217
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:43,050
these human reward systems get.
They just get corrupt.

1218
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:48,100
Did.
My theory on this idea is that we have 

1219
00:56:48,411 --> 00:56:50,810
biochemical drives,
as you've just described,

1220
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,680
that compel us to move forward and to 
survive.

1221
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:59,150
But we also have a culture that's 
continually stimulate in fear and desire

1222
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:04,160
in order to cost us in a particular 
economic role that have consumer.

1223
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:09,430
And the reason that I believe that this 
program and indeed this book are 

1224
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:14,381
important,
is because it is a code to awakening a 

1225
00:57:14,381 --> 00:57:16,970
code to becoming conscious and once you 
are conscious you aren't beholden to the

1226
00:57:16,971 --> 00:57:21,971
same systems.
So much of our behAvior is a result of 

1227
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:23,090
what we don't know about ourselves.
We are motivated.

1228
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:28,330
we're trying to fulfill ourselves 
because there is that biochemical 

1229
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:31,811
imperative to get more to survive.
Which as an addict I experienced and 

1230
00:57:31,811 --> 00:57:33,180
have experienced an extreme sex,
sex,

1231
00:57:33,181 --> 00:57:33,710
sex,
sex,

1232
00:57:33,711 --> 00:57:38,711
sex till.
There's no more getting out of my head 

1233
00:57:38,711 --> 00:57:41,141
till it's inconceivable that I could do 
that anymore without killing myself a 

1234
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:43,100
one in status and power and prestige.

1235
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:48,100
And see.
The reason that I think this system 

1236
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:48,470
works outside of addiction in it's as 
it's currently recognized is I've had to

1237
00:57:48,471 --> 00:57:50,900
work in all sorts of ways.
Once I got rid of drugs,

1238
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:52,430
I got obsessed with sex.
Once I get,

1239
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:57,520
once I get a handle on sex,
I've stopped being obsessed with what 

1240
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:57,520
other people think of me.
Power,

1241
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,170
fame and money,
and what I'm continually recognizing is 

1242
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:05,171
none of these things can be fulfilling.
If you're not connected to who you 

1243
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:05,171
really are,
that can give you a moment.

1244
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:09,881
Then you're free to pursue your art or 
your creation of structures in a 

1245
00:58:09,881 --> 00:58:14,591
conscious way.
You're not doing it because you feel 

1246
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:15,740
unconsciously a bit worthless or a bit 
crap or like it might fulfill you.

1247
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,400
It becomes pragmatic.
Eric,

1248
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:21,070
do you also feel that like less 
concentrating on yourself and less being

1249
00:58:21,071 --> 00:58:26,071
self obsessed is allowed you to have 
more open communication with other 

1250
00:58:26,071 --> 00:58:28,870
people and more healthy like back and 
forth,

1251
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:30,490
fulfilling communication with other 
people,

1252
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:35,491
which literally makes you happier.
Whereas you thought that being obsessed 

1253
00:58:35,491 --> 00:58:39,181
with yourself and being obsessed with 
success and adulation and or sex or 

1254
00:58:39,761 --> 00:58:44,761
whatever those other things were that 
you were obsessed with was going to 

1255
00:58:44,761 --> 00:58:47,161
fulfill those needs and they weren't,
but that community and bonding and 

1256
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,450
that's a big part of jujitsu as well,
man.

1257
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:50,560
So I think part of it,
yeah,

1258
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,400
big,
big,

1259
00:58:51,401 --> 00:58:52,600
big,
big part of jujitsu.

1260
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:55,210
It's like we're a family when you're in 
there choking each other,

1261
00:58:55,211 --> 00:58:59,980
as weird as that sounds like there's a.
There's a bond between those people that

1262
00:58:59,981 --> 00:59:01,870
are in those classes all over the world 
that are.

1263
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:03,260
They're going to.
They they,

1264
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:08,470
they recognize this community in that as
well as it being an extreme pursuit and 

1265
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,190
as well as it being something that is 
developing your human potential,

1266
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,890
you're also.
You're also creating this really intense

1267
00:59:14,891 --> 00:59:17,830
community of likeminded people.
Comedians feel that.

1268
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:23,150
I definitely feel that with you.
I feel that with most comedians that 

1269
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,860
come in here and I know what you.
We are the same thing in a lot of ways.

1270
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:25,870
Yes.
Yes.

1271
00:59:25,871 --> 00:59:30,871
I think that's very important and in a 
way it's a return to what you were 

1272
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:33,931
saying at the beginning of our 
conversation that there are certain 

1273
00:59:33,931 --> 00:59:37,171
anthropology core requirements that you 
need to feel lIke you're part of a 

1274
00:59:37,171 --> 00:59:41,701
tribe.
You need to feel connected to one 

1275
00:59:41,701 --> 00:59:44,161
another and in my very limited pop in 
there once a week experiences of bjj 

1276
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:50,010
when I've done classes with other people
instead of just the one on one with the 

1277
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:50,510
instructor because he looks after me,
you know,

1278
00:59:50,511 --> 00:59:52,330
I mean he's delicate because he's 
brilliant,

1279
00:59:52,331 --> 00:59:55,390
but when it's with like other people 
that are similar beginner level,

1280
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,330
there's moments of real intensity within
it,

1281
00:59:58,331 --> 01:00:03,331
but afterwards,
a sense of fraternity and love and 

1282
01:00:03,331 --> 01:00:05,560
closeness and like some stuff that I'm 
not familiar with have not used to being

1283
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:10,561
close to men in that kind of way and 
it's amazing and beautiful and probably 

1284
01:00:10,561 --> 01:00:14,851
very,
very natural and impute important side 

1285
01:00:14,851 --> 01:00:18,630
of my life that I didn't explore because
I did download the myth of our time that

1286
01:00:18,911 --> 01:00:23,911
you are an individual and you carve your
own way in this world and what's 

1287
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:27,460
important is your power,
your ability to affect change on others.

1288
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,270
Your ability to sleep with women,
the adulation of others.

1289
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:34,360
And as I've got older and having 
experience a degree of it,

1290
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:35,410
I recognize,
oh,

1291
01:00:35,411 --> 01:00:36,880
it's not real.
It doesn't work.

1292
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:41,910
And symbol things.
Connection and community have become 

1293
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,450
more and more valuable to me,
but it's an ongoing thing because if you

1294
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:45,700
set,
the percentage is so close,

1295
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,920
you know,
we're not getting involved.

1296
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:51,930
Recently in a campaign that it was.
I got involved in a campaign to save a 

1297
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:55,141
house in the state a couple of years 
back about these women asked me to tell 

1298
01:00:55,141 --> 01:00:57,991
them our state's going to get turned 
into commercial flats were all getting 

1299
01:00:57,991 --> 01:00:57,991
evicted.
We live here with our families.

1300
01:00:57,991 --> 01:00:59,980
I back their campaign,
I've got them on the tv,

1301
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:05,160
this corporate power back down and it 
was amazing because like ordinary 

1302
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:06,830
people,
ordinary family be,

1303
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:09,550
you know,
it was like the rebels be in the empire.

1304
01:01:09,551 --> 01:01:12,490
It's like an amazing achievement of 
those people.

1305
01:01:12,491 --> 01:01:15,750
But my ego,
like there I am,

1306
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,940
the power,
I am the power fed back into it.

1307
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,580
You know,
so like I,

1308
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:25,630
I see it as an ongoing thing,
but that my life now is how can I convey

1309
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:29,140
ideas that I think will help people in a
way that is accessible?

1310
01:01:29,141 --> 01:01:31,690
How can I be useful?
And knowing that my,

1311
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:36,870
my role in this is to make sure that I 
don't slip into the yoga egomania again 

1312
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,490
because I would love to be a cult leader
on some days.

1313
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:42,590
Thinking,
thinking about it though and being aware

1314
01:01:42,591 --> 01:01:45,500
of it is one of the most important steps
because we're all,

1315
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:47,030
we're all a work in progress.
I mean,

1316
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:49,040
there's no perfect person out there.
They don't exist.

1317
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:50,990
And we've already discussed this kind of
ad nauseum,

1318
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:51,890
right?
I mean,

1319
01:01:51,891 --> 01:01:53,960
I'm a work in progress.
You're a work in progress.

1320
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,580
I don't,
I've never met anybody who wasn't.

1321
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:58,400
And I never met anybody who doesn't 
vacillate at least a little bit,

1322
01:01:58,401 --> 01:02:03,401
larry.
There were some days you're better than 

1323
01:02:03,401 --> 01:02:03,401
other days and those days where you're 
not as good,

1324
01:02:03,401 --> 01:02:07,421
you feel uncomfortable about it.
And those are the lid would lead to 

1325
01:02:07,421 --> 01:02:07,421
better days.
When you find yourself slipping,

1326
01:02:07,421 --> 01:02:11,480
those slipping moments are actually 
critical because they give you some self

1327
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:13,070
awareness.
You realize why I fucked up,

1328
01:02:13,071 --> 01:02:14,360
you know,
I yelled,

1329
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:17,090
fuck you at my car window when I 
shouldn't have or whatever it was,

1330
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:17,390
you know.

1331
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:18,190
Well,
again,

1332
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,070
this system is what provides

1333
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,580
you a way out at like the,
you know,

1334
01:02:21,581 --> 01:02:24,940
the recovery system,
this 12 step system is that you like,

1335
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,690
you would not rely on one person to be 
perfect.

1336
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:32,040
You recognize everyone is fallible,
but together as a community we can start

1337
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:35,310
to have better objectives and in an 
instance like I fuck up all the time,

1338
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:40,520
but this step nine,
step 10 or about making amends when you 

1339
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,230
make a mistake.
So I would like now I literally do this.

1340
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:44,710
If there's a moment where I shout fuck 
you,

1341
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:49,730
but somebody or it isn't.
I go shuffling back a day later 

1342
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:50,880
listening to this thing where I said 
fuck you.

1343
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:53,880
That was wrong with me.
That must have affected your feelings to

1344
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:56,770
find someone in traffic there you to 
fuck you.

1345
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,800
Yeah.
I'll try and do it real quick.

1346
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:04,170
You've got,
you've got fast and a lot of my fuck 

1347
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:04,170
you's.
Maybe it's on a phone call or maybe it's

1348
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:05,300
in a shop or whatever.
The air like,

1349
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:09,510
I mean in a way is about,
I suppose becoming a benevolent force in

1350
01:03:09,511 --> 01:03:11,850
this world.
If I tend towards that better,

1351
01:03:11,851 --> 01:03:14,520
50 point one percent as opposed to the 
49,

1352
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:19,590
then I'm becoming an a progressive agent
or a bird benevolent agent as opposed to

1353
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:21,480
another person intoxicated.

1354
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:27,090
I think it's a microcosm of what we were
talking about earlier about society 

1355
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:30,001
itself is that one day in the future,
look what the way we behave today is 

1356
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:33,610
light years past the way they behaved in
during the inquisition.

1357
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:34,890
I mean in,
in,

1358
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:39,920
in the future.
I imagine especially today because 

1359
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,490
people have so much access to the way 
other people have behaved.

1360
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:47,440
We have so much data on just written 
words,

1361
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:52,480
listening to people talk and podcasts 
and speeches and watching videos.

1362
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:55,590
There's so much more data than there 
ever was available.

1363
01:03:55,591 --> 01:03:57,700
One hundred,
200 a thousand years ago,

1364
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
that in the future we're going to have a
much better way of communicating based 

1365
01:04:03,851 --> 01:04:05,770
on the learning and growth if we 
survive.

1366
01:04:05,771 --> 01:04:10,771
Right,
and I think that's the same thing with 

1367
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:10,771
You and I and everybody listening to 
this as a human being.

1368
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:15,420
If you continue to grow and you don't 
fall into all these traps as time goes 

1369
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:16,750
on,
you will be a better version.

1370
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,960
It's slow and it's fucking brutal and 
it's painful sometimes because it's 

1371
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:22,810
just,
You feel like,

1372
01:04:22,811 --> 01:04:25,150
god,
why don't I have my shit together?

1373
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,220
You know?
I mean there's,

1374
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:32,060
I was saying this about Donald Trump,
like someone was writing off Donald 

1375
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:32,060
Trump,
like he's never going to learn.

1376
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:32,060
You know,
he's who he is.

1377
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:36,481
I'm like,
did you just stop learning when you're 

1378
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:36,481
70,
like,

1379
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:36,481
70?
That's it.

1380
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:37,510
It's over.
There's no more data's getting in there.

1381
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:38,350
Well,
I don't know.

1382
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:38,950
I don't.
I mean,

1383
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:41,920
maybe Donald Trump could have a 
revelation one day,

1384
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:46,950
you know,
maybe Donald Trump could realize the 

1385
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:47,270
error of his ways and the way he 
communicates is his,

1386
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:52,330
you know,
he's causing more problems and he's 

1387
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:52,330
fixing,
you know,

1388
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:54,380
maybe he'll be not even to point him out
because it's just,

1389
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,230
he's just one of us,
right?

1390
01:04:56,430 --> 01:05:00,220
To all of us that I think we're,
we're all slowly,

1391
01:05:00,221 --> 01:05:05,221
brutally piecing this thing together and
hopefully we're better at it than we 

1392
01:05:05,221 --> 01:05:08,170
were a week ago and hopefully we're 
better at it than we were six months ago

1393
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:09,550
and that it's going to continue.

1394
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:14,960
Well,
that feels like the general tendency in 

1395
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:14,960
my own life to put out the general 
tendency in your life.

1396
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,320
Absolutely.

1397
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:20,470
And you know,
one of the things that's helped 

1398
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:20,470
tremendously as this podcast,
being able to have these long three hour

1399
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:24,811
conversations with people,
you sit down and talk to them with no 

1400
01:05:24,811 --> 01:05:25,310
distractions.
It doesn't exist anywhere else.

1401
01:05:25,311 --> 01:05:26,680
It doesn't exist in nature.
Someone.

1402
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,540
Someone said this to me,
they said,

1403
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:33,541
you know,
you always say on your Podcast that you 

1404
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:33,541
just try to have a conversation.
He goes,

1405
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:33,541
but who the fuck has these kinds of 
conversations?

1406
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,940
We just sit down and stare at each other
and talk for hours at a time.

1407
01:05:36,941 --> 01:05:38,770
I'm like,
get your right.

1408
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:40,720
I mean,
it is just a conversation still,

1409
01:05:40,721 --> 01:05:41,650
but you're right.
Is that,

1410
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:44,310
it's sort of an accelerated form of it.
It's like a.

1411
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:45,370
If you,
you know,

1412
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,830
you could kind of apply it to everything
else.

1413
01:05:47,831 --> 01:05:50,550
If you spent enough time doing it,
you know,

1414
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:51,330
you're just,
you're,

1415
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:53,290
you're going to get better at it and 
you're going to.

1416
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:58,590
A lot of the podcasts is thinking right 
and it's an examining your own behavior 

1417
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:02,161
and examining the way you interface with
other people and I do more of that than 

1418
01:06:02,161 --> 01:06:06,571
I ever have before.
What do you want to change about 

1419
01:06:06,571 --> 01:06:06,820
yourself?
Just keep going the same way.

1420
01:06:06,821 --> 01:06:10,540
I'm going to get better at being nice,
get better at being honest,

1421
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:12,360
get better at being in loving.
I mean,

1422
01:06:12,361 --> 01:06:14,300
it sounds hokey,
hippie bullshit.

1423
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,750
He says,
yeah,

1424
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,960
I want to.
I want to be nicer.

1425
01:06:16,961 --> 01:06:18,790
To me.
I want to have better relationships with

1426
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:21,190
my friends,
better relationships with my family,

1427
01:06:21,191 --> 01:06:23,920
better relationships with people that I 
don't even know that.

1428
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:27,910
I mean I just want to interface with the
world in a more positive way.

1429
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:33,140
I think one of the most important things
to realize is all the interactions that 

1430
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:34,510
we have with each other,
a dependent upon to individuals or more.

1431
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:39,510
Right,
but it's You and whoever you encounter 

1432
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:42,530
and the way you encountered them is 
going to change the way they behave to 

1433
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:47,371
you and everybody always wants to put it
off on the person who behaved a certain 

1434
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:49,240
way to them and in some ways you're 
right,

1435
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:54,480
but in other ways your reaction is 
completely dependent on your own way of 

1436
01:06:55,691 --> 01:07:00,691
approaching it and your reaction may 
change the way they react and you'll 

1437
01:07:00,691 --> 01:07:02,800
complete the right like any.
Like if the,

1438
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,020
you know,
throwIng a pool against that brick wall,

1439
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:10,021
it will bounce back a certain way,
but if that became a softer surface or 

1440
01:07:10,021 --> 01:07:10,021
indeed a furry wall to quote one of my 
own films,

1441
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:15,150
that it will bounce back in a different 
way so that they did another thing 

1442
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:17,050
that's in the program than necessity for
forgiveness.

1443
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:22,770
If you.
If you instead of blaming your past and 

1444
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:23,080
blaming other people,
you come to a point of forgiveness.

1445
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:27,280
This creates the silver,
the nexus for change.

1446
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:28,040
As long as you're like,
ah,

1447
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:33,100
that person felt me out when I was a kid
or my bad wasn't a loving figure in my 

1448
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:34,990
life.
As long as I hold onto that belief,

1449
01:07:34,991 --> 01:07:36,380
I'm trapped by it.
I mean,

1450
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,670
I say I relinquished that now.
It's not happening anymore.

1451
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:42,070
I'm willing to move forward.
That's another human being.

1452
01:07:42,071 --> 01:07:45,670
They were doing the best they could.
Suddenly you're liberate it in your path

1453
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:46,780
changes.
Now,

1454
01:07:46,781 --> 01:07:48,400
joe,
when you were saying just then mate,

1455
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:53,700
about like wanting to help people,
do you have any particular projects are 

1456
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,791
specifically about that?
Obviously this podcast is a tool for 

1457
01:07:56,791 --> 01:08:00,991
education,
but do you have anything that 

1458
01:08:00,991 --> 01:08:00,991
specifically about right,
I'm going to do this thing like,

1459
01:08:00,991 --> 01:08:05,521
I don't know,
take in martial arts in the community 

1460
01:08:05,521 --> 01:08:05,521
type stuff?
No,

1461
01:08:05,521 --> 01:08:07,000
no.
You think it'd be really good at that if

1462
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:08,620
I had more time.
I just don't.

1463
01:08:08,621 --> 01:08:10,690
I don't have enough time to do what I'm 
already doing,

1464
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:15,810
you know what I mean?
In terms of just sheer numbers of hours 

1465
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:15,950
in the day and I think

1466
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:19,250
I can't just work because if I just 
worked,

1467
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:21,830
my work won't be any good.
I mean you have to live.

1468
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:26,860
It's one of the most important things 
about standup comedy is you can't just 

1469
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:30,161
do comedy.
You have to do other things and this is 

1470
01:08:30,161 --> 01:08:30,161
something that took me a long time to 
figure out like you can't,

1471
01:08:30,161 --> 01:08:35,040
like you ever see a lot of comics,
they just started talking about airline 

1472
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,291
travel and hotel rooms and your life is 
your life and they can relate to it,

1473
01:08:39,591 --> 01:08:40,610
so that's what they talk about.
What?

1474
01:08:40,611 --> 01:08:44,510
That to me is a failure of gathering 
research.

1475
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:46,650
I mean it's all.
It's life,

1476
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:48,620
right?
But your life has to.

1477
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:53,621
I think in order to have a continual 
body of work again,

1478
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:56,570
he can't just constantly talk about 
airline travel.

1479
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:01,840
You have input.
My thing in the beginning of this was 

1480
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,741
about airline travel and the low level,
low frequency anxiety I experienced in 

1481
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:06,380
airline workers.

1482
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:11,410
It certainly wasn't a comedic bit,
but it was cultural analysis and did to 

1483
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:14,260
a degree revealed that I'm in the middle
of a press junket and that's my life at 

1484
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:17,501
the moment.
I could just as easily have told you 

1485
01:09:17,501 --> 01:09:17,501
about bees.
I'm a bee keeper.

1486
01:09:17,501 --> 01:09:17,501
I've bees.
All right.

1487
01:09:17,501 --> 01:09:19,430
Do you swim in the river?
you have experiences,

1488
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,130
you have said for we sort of one be,
I'm not keeping one b,

1489
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:25,810
one b,
one one doesn't work.

1490
01:09:25,811 --> 01:09:27,010
You're like,
be.

1491
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:29,760
I'm afraid.
I said responsibility to have now.

1492
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:34,810
Sixty thousand pounds.
I'm not taking them on the or anything 

1493
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:34,810
like that,
but he doesn't.

1494
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:34,810
Yeah,
you're right.

1495
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:34,810
It's given me and said,
what's your standard,

1496
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:37,670
your standup comedy then what is it 
currently?

1497
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,290
What are you covering?
What your sections,

1498
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:45,300
your bolts.
See what I'm doing right now is working 

1499
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,090
towards the new netflix special that I'm
going to do in either march or april.

1500
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,950
I have to figure it out.
Uh,

1501
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:53,980
want to do it in boston and I don't want
to do when it's too cold because that 

1502
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:55,030
1000 seat place in boston.
I think wilbur.

1503
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:55,710
Yeah,
they will.

1504
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,910
Yeah.
It's awesome little theater because it's

1505
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:03,911
really 900 seats and it's really three,
300 seat comedy clubs.

1506
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:06,350
Yeah.
It's three stacked on top of each other.

1507
01:10:06,351 --> 01:10:08,310
It's a great venue.
Well,

1508
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,560
you'll say,
so you're going to do an hour of free 

1509
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:13,560
nights.
Boy,

1510
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:16,510
you'll see.
What if you got to a free 20 minute 

1511
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:16,510
average?
Do you know what your pit.

1512
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:16,630
So yeah.
Anyways,

1513
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,640
if you don't mind me,
it's difficult to talk about it on the 

1514
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,070
podcast because without going into 
actual.

1515
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,960
But can you tell about the area or I'll 
tell you about my arrows to show you 

1516
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,330
this.
So I think I talked about like when I 

1517
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:30,980
got heavily involved in politics and I 
found myself on tv shows and doing rants

1518
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,840
on telly and getting into arguments.

1519
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,220
Those are great,
but otherwise thank you.

1520
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,690
I love doing those.
Love the one you did.

1521
01:10:35,691 --> 01:10:37,500
Was it fox news that you did one with 
it?

1522
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,800
Breaking down like what are we doing 
here?

1523
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,980
I love doing that.
I liked that love,

1524
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,570
ridicule available.
Once you get into the analysis,

1525
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:49,680
you're,
you're a fucking runaway train and once 

1526
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,941
you start a sentence and you start going
very fast and powerful and they'll be 

1527
01:10:51,941 --> 01:10:51,941
like,
whoa,

1528
01:10:51,941 --> 01:10:51,941
whoa,
whoa,

1529
01:10:51,941 --> 01:10:51,941
whoa,
whoa.

1530
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:56,600
And there's not a lot of ums or uhs to 
interject and they're sitting there.

1531
01:10:56,601 --> 01:10:57,690
They're all,
you know,

1532
01:10:57,691 --> 01:11:02,691
first of all,
the little starry eyed in the first 

1533
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:02,691
place.
Second of all though,

1534
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:03,520
the runaway trains happened like,
uh,

1535
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:08,750
uh,
under the ride's over five minutes 

1536
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,751
later,
like tin cans or rolling down the aisle 

1537
01:11:10,751 --> 01:11:10,751
and they're like,
okay,

1538
01:11:10,751 --> 01:11:12,290
it's a good technique because see that 
what we were saying about bjj,

1539
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:15,090
that,
that language don't know the language,

1540
01:11:15,091 --> 01:11:17,040
the language comedy,
it's a language I've worked on.

1541
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,830
So one of my techniques is never create 
space.

1542
01:11:19,831 --> 01:11:24,300
Give them no space,
no space,

1543
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:29,301
no space smush.
See if you take the actual jujitsu out 

1544
01:11:29,301 --> 01:11:29,301
of it.
I'm brilliant.

1545
01:11:29,301 --> 01:11:32,040
Or jujitsu,
it's just the actual physical contact.

1546
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:35,990
Hold locks and chokes judges who shows 
itself in all forms.

1547
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:37,620
Yeah,
that is true.

1548
01:11:37,621 --> 01:11:39,720
Transcendence to find one universal 
language,

1549
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:42,420
one universal myth,
one mind one consciousness,

1550
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:43,340
one,
yes,

1551
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,550
no,
the way broadly.

1552
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:46,330
And you'll see it in all things.
So Ryan Hamilton,

1553
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,750
masashi,
that was pretty good for five rings.

1554
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:53,810
Just drop that in there.
Chinese philosophy or something like 

1555
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:54,960
that to my arm.
What is he?

1556
01:11:54,961 --> 01:11:59,030
Some sort of master?
He was a samurai that was a,

1557
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,230
he was a ronan.
He was,

1558
01:12:00,231 --> 01:12:05,231
uh,
during the time where samurais roamed 

1559
01:12:05,231 --> 01:12:05,520
the earth and got into these one-on-one 
sword fights.

1560
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:08,400
And he killed 62 men in one-on-one sword
fights.

1561
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:10,530
I said,
life in a bad motherfucker.

1562
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:13,080
He wrote an amazing book on strategy in 
life.

1563
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:17,250
And one of the things that he emphasized
in that book is that a real warrior must

1564
01:12:17,251 --> 01:12:22,251
be balanced.
You must be good at art and calligraphy 

1565
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:22,251
and poetry.
Good.

1566
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:25,610
Can't have any holes in your game that 
you have a balanced person in order to 

1567
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:26,970
survive in these intense moments of 
sorts,

1568
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:31,971
flying at your face.
I had never teach a man to fight who 

1569
01:12:31,971 --> 01:12:31,971
doesn't know how to dance.
It's quite good in it.

1570
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:37,350
I don't know how to dance set paycheck 
they like.

1571
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:41,010
But what I sort of like,
what I've done is I've found things like

1572
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:46,190
the approach from a different angle of 
like pointing out the things that I did 

1573
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:47,730
wrong in my political campaigning where 
I floored and fed into my ego.

1574
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:51,240
I do a good long bit about the birth of 
my daughter,

1575
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:54,630
like purely from the perspective of a 
watching a birth,

1576
01:12:54,631 --> 01:12:55,350
like,
like,

1577
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:55,990
uh,
uh,

1578
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:56,780
commentary,
uh,

1579
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:59,160
sports commentary on the baby coming 
out.

1580
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,310
I don't use the beat,
uh,

1581
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:05,370
the rhythms of sports commentary,
but just actually describing what 

1582
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:08,781
happened and what it did to my mind to 
be present at the birth of my daughter 

1583
01:13:08,781 --> 01:13:09,630
to experience something that's so 
defined,

1584
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:12,780
but so animal tearing,
flesh roaring and all that stuff.

1585
01:13:12,781 --> 01:13:15,030
But It's like god is in their house,
you know?

1586
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:20,330
So it did it beyond that.
But in every time I building up into a 

1587
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:20,880
point of divinity,
I undercut it with like,

1588
01:13:20,881 --> 01:13:23,240
you know,
how sort of mad it looks and the obvious

1589
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:26,210
stuff I guess you'd call it.
So like I do that so.

1590
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:29,790
And the whole show rebif,
which I'm doing from a netflix,

1591
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:32,640
I believe at some point soon it's like a
is about,

1592
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:37,641
it's called rebirth.
And the point of it is how having the 

1593
01:13:37,641 --> 01:13:37,641
babies,
men,

1594
01:13:37,641 --> 01:13:41,780
I've been reborn to myself,
but a lot of it's about recognizing the 

1595
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:45,621
limits because I think I got very 
narcissistically involved in politics 

1596
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:49,340
the same way and possibly getting 
narcissistically involved in 

1597
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:49,450
spirituality right now because I still 
have this yearning,

1598
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,410
this thing that wants to change other 
people's lives,

1599
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:55,170
changed the world in inverted commas.
You know,

1600
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:59,360
but like the comedy comes from 
recognizing my own flaws within you.

1601
01:13:59,361 --> 01:14:04,361
Do you do any sort of like really 
difficult to exercise outside of a 

1602
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:06,090
jujitsu?
Do you ever do ever get involved in,

1603
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,890
you know,
any like yoga,

1604
01:14:07,891 --> 01:14:10,020
like intense yoga,
like long periods of time,

1605
01:14:10,021 --> 01:14:12,070
like 90 minute hot yoga classes

1606
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,820
or running or anything where you really 
have to push yourself physically,

1607
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:21,060
really push a run and then listen to 
your podcasts and sam harris' podcast 

1608
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:23,080
sometimes or wherever and I'm like,
and I do.

1609
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:25,140
I do do yoga,
but not like.

1610
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,150
It's interesting that you specifically 
say push yourself to the limit.

1611
01:14:28,151 --> 01:14:29,150
Why do you think that's an important 
part?

1612
01:14:29,151 --> 01:14:34,151
I think there's a freeing aspect and 
pushing boundaries and physical 

1613
01:14:34,151 --> 01:14:36,430
boundaries because it's exhausting and 
not just exhausting physically,

1614
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:39,560
but mentally too because there's a 
strain on your.

1615
01:14:39,561 --> 01:14:41,950
Your body's desire to quit,
like your,

1616
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:46,960
your,
your mind's desire to seek comfort and 

1617
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,191
that in pushing past that you find this 
freedom and you also find a 

1618
01:14:50,191 --> 01:14:50,890
vulnerability and who you are as a 
person.

1619
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:56,230
It's very difficult to think greatly of 
yourself and to Be egos autistic when 

1620
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:58,750
you know that you're so fucking tired,
you have to put your hands on your knees

1621
01:14:58,751 --> 01:15:00,400
and your,
you're heaving and you know,

1622
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,510
and then you have to keep going and then
don't,

1623
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,240
don't be opposed to you.

1624
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,030
Come on,
keep going.

1625
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:05,110
And so you,
you don't,

1626
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:09,490
you realize who you are.
You feel yourself for who you really are

1627
01:15:09,491 --> 01:15:13,680
as opposed to like adulation and looking
at yourself as this,

1628
01:15:13,681 --> 01:15:15,820
uh,
this thing that's above it all.

1629
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:19,150
Like you realize the flaws in your 
mental process,

1630
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:21,640
the flaws in your,
your physical abilities.

1631
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,250
And I think it's very humbling you.
Yeah,

1632
01:15:24,251 --> 01:15:29,251
right.
I can see that doing that in a bodily 

1633
01:15:29,251 --> 01:15:29,251
way,
it will be useful.

1634
01:15:29,251 --> 01:15:30,070
But like I tell you the truth,
the trouble for me,

1635
01:15:30,071 --> 01:15:35,071
and I think a lot of addicts,
he's not the like of course they self 

1636
01:15:35,071 --> 01:15:38,101
obsession,
but self obsession isn't usually about 

1637
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:38,770
fucking great.
IT's normally I'm worthless.

1638
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,870
That's why he comes mostly from that 
position,

1639
01:15:40,871 --> 01:15:43,270
but it's also you're thInking about 
yourself all the time,

1640
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:48,271
right?
That is the problem that needs to be 

1641
01:15:48,271 --> 01:15:48,271
decoded.
And I think you're right,

1642
01:15:48,271 --> 01:15:48,910
that physical exercise is really,
really important.

1643
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:51,400
The level to the level to which I think 
I always feel better.

1644
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:56,460
It's not my,
like I have to work even to bloody do 

1645
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:59,221
that.
I'd rather spend a ton of time thinking 

1646
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,360
or doing something thinking I'm fucking 
coming is thinking that's what's,

1647
01:16:01,361 --> 01:16:03,820
what's confusing about it to people.
It's thinking,

1648
01:16:03,821 --> 01:16:05,500
but it's thinking in a very different 
Way.

1649
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,800
Like there's,
there's thinking when your body's at 

1650
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,961
rest and you're just using your mind 
whether there's also thinking when your 

1651
01:16:12,961 --> 01:16:14,080
mind is trying to manage your body under
extreme stress.

1652
01:16:14,081 --> 01:16:17,530
And that is also a mental exercise and 
that's where people get it wrong.

1653
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:22,740
When people look at people that exercise
and especially people that work out 

1654
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:25,510
really hard and they think of them as 
meatheads or as like someone who's based

1655
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:30,570
or primal and unevolved.
But I feel like there's a high level of 

1656
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:33,320
mental evolution involved and being able
to push yourself like,

1657
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:36,700
like I,
I really admire people that,

1658
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:39,370
you know,
like you'll see like a lot of old people

1659
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,450
that are,
uh,

1660
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:45,750
I see him in yoga class all the time 
that just never fucking stop in there.

1661
01:16:46,691 --> 01:16:48,730
And they don't have extreme physical 
abilities at all.

1662
01:16:48,731 --> 01:16:51,610
They're not,
there's nothing athletic aBout them.

1663
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:53,770
They're not strong,
but they're in there grinding.

1664
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:56,170
and in doing so you have to,
I mean,

1665
01:16:56,171 --> 01:16:58,600
it can't possibly be comfortable for 
them.

1666
01:16:58,601 --> 01:17:00,780
Right?
I look at their saggy arms and their old

1667
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:03,400
legs.
This is not like some graceful person is

1668
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:06,670
able to do this easily.
This is a person who's really struggling

1669
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:10,310
and in real struggle,
like that is a mental

1670
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:15,370
energy that's involved in forcing your 
body to go through these uncomfortable 

1671
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:17,000
emotions.
That I think is very freeing.

1672
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,560
Yeah.
I think you're right.

1673
01:17:18,561 --> 01:17:23,561
What you said as well about balance and 
possibly what you're saying is that I'm 

1674
01:17:23,561 --> 01:17:24,380
a person who will benefit from more of 
that.

1675
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:27,660
I see a guy in the gym once and he said,
don't stop exercising.

1676
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,300
He was old,
he was like in his seventies.

1677
01:17:29,301 --> 01:17:30,410
He goes,
don't stop exercising,

1678
01:17:30,411 --> 01:17:32,620
don't let your body find out these 
dying.

1679
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:37,220
I just keep going.
Don't let your body find out.

1680
01:17:37,221 --> 01:17:38,510
It's dying.
That's great.

1681
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,500
Yeah,
that's pretty cool.

1682
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:40,090
Isn't it?
So,

1683
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:40,970
yeah.
So,

1684
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:43,940
but like I think that in any form of,
uh,

1685
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:47,000
I think that some variety of it.
I know you do the yoga,

1686
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:48,800
you do the brazilian jujitsu,
you do the running.

1687
01:17:48,801 --> 01:17:51,020
I think it's very important of different
forms of exercise,

1688
01:17:51,021 --> 01:17:56,021
different forms of mental activity,
different forms of stimulation to live 

1689
01:17:56,021 --> 01:17:57,710
like good because this is what this 
machine is designed to do.

1690
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:02,710
And again,
I returned to the problem of capitalism 

1691
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:05,290
is that it reduces you to your role 
within an economic system as opposed to 

1692
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:07,490
why not gap.
Go for a run through a bit of fishing.

1693
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:09,350
Could wander around,
shoot some arrows,

1694
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,930
do whatever it is you're into.
I spend some time,

1695
01:18:11,931 --> 01:18:14,150
meditate in,
spend some time exercising,

1696
01:18:14,151 --> 01:18:16,500
spent a time in loving physical combat.
Well,

1697
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:18,500
the reason you can't,
there's no fucking time because he's.

1698
01:18:18,501 --> 01:18:21,630
Your job is to stand on the line or in 
that cheese grater.

1699
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:24,500
Great.
It just get your soul ground down.

1700
01:18:24,501 --> 01:18:26,780
Yeah,
that's necessary anymore.

1701
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:31,810
It's not necessarily.
It's certainly isn't necessarily enough 

1702
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:33,380
to justify spending eight hours plus a 
day,

1703
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:36,080
five days a week inside some sort of a 
box.

1704
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:41,090
I know a while ago you said we are both 
a speck of dust and limitless 

1705
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:43,550
consciousness and this I agree with to 
limitless expansion,

1706
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:48,640
limitless contraction,
possible within consciousness and what 

1707
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,971
you said,
if that one idea can change the world 

1708
01:18:51,971 --> 01:18:54,200
very quickly and that's why they'd be 
systems regulate the kind of information

1709
01:18:54,201 --> 01:18:59,201
that's available and the way that it's 
transmitted and also the fact that it 

1710
01:18:59,201 --> 01:18:59,480
exists within the same economic model.

1711
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:01,460
You can,
as long as you're making money,

1712
01:19:01,461 --> 01:19:04,160
as long as the money's getting directed 
in the right way.

1713
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:06,440
People will let us talk about real 
radical stuff.

1714
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:07,820
They're quite comfortable for us to say,
hey,

1715
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:10,530
you should break down the system.
You should devolve at twilight,

1716
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:11,810
this conversation.
Whereas with geico,

1717
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:16,830
p attachable,
he's an australian gay rights activist 

1718
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:20,951
who lives in the uk and he said,
it's like when you're talking like this 

1719
01:19:20,951 --> 01:19:24,410
with no disrespect,
disrespect for the great civil rights 

1720
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:24,410
heroes in the people that have had civil
rights struggles,

1721
01:19:24,411 --> 01:19:29,411
but he said,
and he's experienced as a gay rights 

1722
01:19:29,411 --> 01:19:29,411
activist.
He goes,

1723
01:19:29,411 --> 01:19:30,980
in the end they will yield when it's to 
do with those things,

1724
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,840
your race,
sexuality.

1725
01:19:32,841 --> 01:19:34,170
People sort of know you guys,
but when you,

1726
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:35,710
you know,
the system will use,

1727
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:36,530
they will you.
All right?

1728
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:37,730
Gay marriage,
of course.

1729
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:38,300
All right.
Yeah.

1730
01:19:38,301 --> 01:19:38,840
We,
you know,

1731
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:41,310
we can't fucking have slavery in the 
end.

1732
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:43,430
And of course these monumental human 
struggles.

1733
01:19:43,431 --> 01:19:48,431
I'm not diminishing them because.
But if you go near people's financial 

1734
01:19:48,431 --> 01:19:52,241
interest,
you are fucked either they'll get you 

1735
01:19:52,241 --> 01:19:52,241
there when you start saying,
hey,

1736
01:19:52,241 --> 01:19:53,930
why don't we not pay our mortgages?
Hey everyone,

1737
01:19:53,931 --> 01:19:58,120
let's not pay tax to stop using oil.
Right?

1738
01:19:58,130 --> 01:19:59,650
You fucking your out.
Uh,

1739
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:01,670
I see it so straight away.
So it's sort of like,

1740
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:05,480
this is what's interesting to me,
like was like these are the,

1741
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:08,040
these are the access points,
these are the points where

1742
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,170
there is vulnerability.
I'm not suggesting that we will organize

1743
01:20:10,171 --> 01:20:15,171
ourself into a radical crew of tax 
avoiders or mortgage renegades or 

1744
01:20:15,721 --> 01:20:17,250
wherever,
but even though

1745
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:19,300
are both doing well,
we're in,

1746
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:21,590
like you said before,
we're not in that weird,

1747
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:26,980
you know,
upper stratosphere where you're living 

1748
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:30,611
on the hamptons and some fucking hundred
acre ridiculous seaside mansion you 

1749
01:20:31,491 --> 01:20:36,491
where your helicopter and private jet 
everywhere and you're worth 

1750
01:20:36,491 --> 01:20:38,240
$100,000,000.
And that's a weird world.

1751
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:41,040
That's a weird world that very few 
people exist in.

1752
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:43,670
Once they get there,
they don't want to leave.

1753
01:20:43,671 --> 01:20:45,920
Once you start flying private 
everywhere,

1754
01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:49,160
you don't want to leave.
Once you have a match and you don't want

1755
01:20:49,161 --> 01:20:52,520
a department,
once you have a bentley,

1756
01:20:52,521 --> 01:20:53,910
you don't want to,
you go,

1757
01:20:53,911 --> 01:20:56,150
you know,
it's like nobody wants to go down.

1758
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:57,260
You want to keep moving up.

1759
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:02,480
Yeah.
And it's weird because those things 

1760
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:02,480
happened.
They tend to happen in.

1761
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,270
So if they haven't been in,
if you've got that money for 

1762
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:05,270
entertainment,
maybe you're still sort of,

1763
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:09,471
you've got some connection to your roots
and your entertainment and not maybe 

1764
01:21:09,471 --> 01:21:13,050
you'll still connected to the source.
But when it's in tech and finance,

1765
01:21:13,051 --> 01:21:14,400
yeah,
you've got a vested interest.

1766
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:17,640
My friend jason segel,
the brilliant actor goes,

1767
01:21:17,641 --> 01:21:18,540
um,
you know,

1768
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,460
you guys,
you think all that stuff's about you,

1769
01:21:20,461 --> 01:21:25,461
the jets and the billboards and stuff.
But it's just the symptoms of other 

1770
01:21:25,461 --> 01:21:28,911
people making money out of you.
It's not that you have a tool in your 

1771
01:21:28,911 --> 01:21:28,911
parlor machine,
you'll be processed to be kicked out.

1772
01:21:28,911 --> 01:21:30,360
It's not a carousel,
it's a train.

1773
01:21:30,361 --> 01:21:33,540
It will run out of energy and as soon as
you're not providing your route.

1774
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:36,390
and I was doing some promo for this 
book.

1775
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:41,470
I'm still trying to.
Sally occasionally promote in this free 

1776
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:42,770
willing conversation at facebook and I 
family,

1777
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:45,450
man,
this place didn't exist 15 years ago.

1778
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:50,200
We've looking at now it is a monolift 
like these other kingdom lives.

1779
01:21:50,201 --> 01:21:54,990
Now google started all these little 
ideas that will make phones.

1780
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:55,550
Fuck

1781
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:58,480
the newest google pixel.
Two phones.

1782
01:21:58,481 --> 01:21:59,110
I mean,
they make,

1783
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:04,140
they make these incredible devices that 
you can interface into the google world 

1784
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:04,840
and they're optimized for their whole 
system.

1785
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:06,340
Amazing,
amazing.

1786
01:22:06,341 --> 01:22:07,700
You know,
david fosTer wallace,

1787
01:22:07,701 --> 01:22:10,820
your great american author in his book,
infinite jest,

1788
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:15,850
postulated a world where all stadiums 
were named after brands were countries 

1789
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:18,910
and regions were named after brands,
and it's sort of happening.

1790
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:24,040
It's happening.
The flags of our nations are merely a 

1791
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,840
veil over the true corporate interests.
The british empire was always about east

1792
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:29,300
India trade and all that kind of crap 
and this country.

1793
01:22:29,301 --> 01:22:31,400
Now it's just a veil over true power.

1794
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:35,970
I'm going to the t mobile arena in las 
vegas this weekend for the ufc.

1795
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,560
Oh yeah.
The team over in the mobile arena,

1796
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,940
that's what it's called.
Now you know,

1797
01:22:39,941 --> 01:22:44,941
you're sort of at fIrst when they start 
to name football stadiums in our 

1798
01:22:44,941 --> 01:22:45,100
country,
you still remembered the name of what it

1799
01:22:45,101 --> 01:22:50,101
used to be before sponsorship,
but we start to forget that it was ever 

1800
01:22:50,101 --> 01:22:50,710
anything else.
You start to forget.

1801
01:22:50,711 --> 01:22:53,380
We were once warriors.
We were once connected to the earth.

1802
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:56,080
We are gods were ones,
eagles and stags.

1803
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:58,660
Now our gods are the timo,
pilar,

1804
01:22:58,661 --> 01:23:00,840
rena,
take back your freedom.

1805
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:03,100
Not the coliseum.
It's the sony center,

1806
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:08,180
right?
The christians are been flown to the 

1807
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:09,190
lines at the same 3:00
PM.

1808
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:12,090
Wow.
Yeah.

1809
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:12,940
Well,
I mean,

1810
01:23:12,941 --> 01:23:14,800
you know,
they want people to use t mobile.

1811
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:15,220
I get it.

1812
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:17,960
Would you mind to use it?
We'll just ask me.

1813
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:19,170
Give me a deal.
Oh,

1814
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:22,490
use it.
I my liquid.

1815
01:23:22,491 --> 01:23:25,010
You're saying keep talking unlimited 
data.

1816
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,520
It's nice.
Yeah.

1817
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:27,470
One.
Hey.

1818
01:23:27,471 --> 01:23:29,700
So like,
I learned an important lesson of you and

1819
01:23:29,701 --> 01:23:34,701
this was it when I was a light came on 
last time you were doing sort of a very 

1820
01:23:34,701 --> 01:23:39,551
big a ufc event in I think vegas and my 
mates,

1821
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,930
like from the gym that I go to,
genesis theme,

1822
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:47,970
I've already mentioned that they were 
coming over for a stack though they 

1823
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:47,970
didn't ask me,
but I sort of thought,

1824
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:52,240
oh listen,
I could further inveigle myself into 

1825
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,590
this little crew of martial artist by 
hooking them up with joe rogan tickets.

1826
01:23:54,591 --> 01:23:55,190
And I thought,
Yeah,

1827
01:23:55,191 --> 01:23:56,330
I'll do that.
Like every,

1828
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:57,530
the politician,
so forth.

1829
01:23:57,531 --> 01:24:01,310
So I text you a joe who hook up my mates
with this thing and he went,

1830
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:01,880
oh,
okay,

1831
01:24:01,881 --> 01:24:03,830
who are these people is important to 
you?

1832
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,350
And I took a moment,
a form.

1833
01:24:05,390 --> 01:24:09,320
They are important and like them,
but was my motivations here.

1834
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:10,970
They're like,
this is a good thing.

1835
01:24:10,971 --> 01:24:15,971
I took a moment to reflect on it for 
shayla do this will come up with 

1836
01:24:15,971 --> 01:24:15,971
tickets,
you know,

1837
01:24:15,971 --> 01:24:16,810
maybe I'm doing this for the wrong 
reasons.

1838
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:21,260
I took a moment of rest are reflected.
I didn't do it well it was a little less

1839
01:24:21,261 --> 01:24:26,261
than.
It was a little less than because you 

1840
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:27,401
gave me pause for rest by.
I think you were doing a standup show 

1841
01:24:27,401 --> 01:24:29,831
actually.
And I was to and they were already had 

1842
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:29,831
tickets for your standup.
That's what it was.

1843
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:33,300
And I was like,
how could you give them backstage 

1844
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,541
passes?
And your answer wasn't an immediate ben 

1845
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:34,541
dover.
Yes,

1846
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:34,541
of course I'll do what you want mr.
Brand.

1847
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:37,970
It was a bit more questioning like,
well who are these guys?

1848
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:41,320
The reason why I ask,
I always ask is because sometimes people

1849
01:24:41,321 --> 01:24:41,890
say,
look,

1850
01:24:41,891 --> 01:24:44,830
you don't have to do this,
but they've been bothering me about it.

1851
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:48,520
It's a guy I work with,
or people have said,

1852
01:24:48,521 --> 01:24:49,710
hey,
would you do this?

1853
01:24:49,711 --> 01:24:51,340
It's my best friend.
I love this guy.

1854
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:52,150
And then I go,
okay,

1855
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:53,220
yeah,
ah,

1856
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:58,230
so you give people little junction 
because sometimes those people are 

1857
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:01,141
paying now because somebody might be a 
pain in the ass to you and you might 

1858
01:25:01,141 --> 01:25:02,890
just be getting in line and I didn't 
know you as well,

1859
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:03,940
you know,
so I'm like,

1860
01:25:03,941 --> 01:25:07,120
well,
and I really admired the way you handled

1861
01:25:07,121 --> 01:25:08,190
it.
Like I said,

1862
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:10,180
do you want to give my number?
And that was the thing,

1863
01:25:10,181 --> 01:25:12,070
and you went,
no,

1864
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:14,170
I don't think I'll give him your number.

1865
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:20,590
It seemed like I might be overcome me 
and made me look at my own motivations 

1866
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:24,430
and I suppose that's it.
Anything that is called the great Carl 

1867
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:24,430
Young,
the mystic,

1868
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:29,291
and one of the pioneers of 
psychoanalysis said anything that 

1869
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:29,720
crosses your path that you didn't intend
for,

1870
01:25:29,721 --> 01:25:32,810
that is god in inverted commerce and 
opportunity to learn.

1871
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:35,250
So this is how I try to approach my life
now.

1872
01:25:35,251 --> 01:25:35,660
I was like,
hmm,

1873
01:25:35,661 --> 01:25:38,090
I didn't plan for that to happen.
What's the lesson here?

1874
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,400
What can I learn from this situation?
So like,

1875
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:40,880
you know,
anyway,

1876
01:25:40,881 --> 01:25:42,620
I'm sure damn guys would have been 
fantastic.

1877
01:25:42,621 --> 01:25:44,880
I though they did later show me videos 
of what went on.

1878
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:49,930
I think it was just stack them and they 
were carrying on like idiots called up 

1879
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:50,420
and down corridors drunk at their mind.
So perhaps it was for the best,

1880
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,790
but generally I'm sure that nothing 
would have gone wrong.

1881
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:54,860
But when I look at my own motivation,
ah,

1882
01:25:54,861 --> 01:25:57,260
what are you doing here?
Why do you want to do this?

1883
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,540
You're doing it a little bit because you
want to look cool.

1884
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,490
Don't bother doing that.
Then you know,

1885
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:06,520
that's a little small in the way that I 
walked the path for a small amendment 

1886
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:08,510
down a line.
Maybe I will ask again.

1887
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:09,110
Yeah,
actually joe,

1888
01:26:09,111 --> 01:26:11,060
could you sort these guys out with 
tickets for this or that?

1889
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:13,790
But I'll do it with the right 
motivation,

1890
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:15,290
the right connection.
Now,

1891
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:20,291
this again,
as I keep saying this journey from 

1892
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:21,620
unconsciousness to consciousness is what
has been the myth of my own life.

1893
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,920
I think we have to.
Whether or not we're in just limitless 

1894
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:27,020
chaos in an ever expanding universe 
without meaning,

1895
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:28,580
without point,
without love,

1896
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:29,690
you know,
it may be.

1897
01:26:29,691 --> 01:26:32,540
That is the way you know that a lot of 
people see the world that way.

1898
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:37,540
It's not how I see the world.
I see there as being meaning in 

1899
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:37,540
everything,
poetry and everything,

1900
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,050
beauty in everything,
and certainly in my own life.

1901
01:26:39,051 --> 01:26:42,620
I like to find the story.
What am I meant to learn here?

1902
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:46,130
What am I meant to do here?
What did I learn from being ahead in the

1903
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:49,220
story that I learned from being 
promiscuous,

1904
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:53,300
from being a drug addict and it all 
seemed to make a kind of sense.

1905
01:26:53,301 --> 01:26:57,590
It all seems to be guiding me towards 
something and that thing does seem to be

1906
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,240
love,
service,

1907
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,920
kindness,
awareness.

1908
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:03,910
Not trying to manipulate people and not 
trying to get shit off people.

1909
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:08,950
Time is a good journey and I feel like 
it's sad if people don't get to do their

1910
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:13,990
own version of that journey because 
they're on the cheese grater or because 

1911
01:27:13,990 --> 01:27:18,011
they're pursuing some myths,
some code from their childhood that 

1912
01:27:18,011 --> 01:27:20,891
they're not good enough or that they 
don't deserve to be happy or they can't 

1913
01:27:20,891 --> 01:27:21,770
achieve anything where whatever rung 
their call on,

1914
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:26,980
whether it's the wrong of booze or drugs
or the wrong of staring at social media 

1915
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:30,641
the whole time with the rung of hatred 
of others or the wrong of being caught 

1916
01:27:30,641 --> 01:27:30,641
in bad relationships and a crap job.

1917
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:35,860
For me,
I think that we can accelerate that 

1918
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:38,531
evolution.
I think that there are codes that can 

1919
01:27:38,531 --> 01:27:40,571
slip through and the same way that an 
amazon can spring up in 15 years and be 

1920
01:27:40,571 --> 01:27:42,050
this great economic monolift,
new ideas,

1921
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:46,340
new faith's new ideologies can slip into
the net.

1922
01:27:46,341 --> 01:27:48,650
Particularly now we have this access to 
technology.

1923
01:27:48,651 --> 01:27:53,651
You've slipped past the gatekeepers.
you have your own media empire out of 

1924
01:27:53,651 --> 01:27:53,651
nothing.
You know,

1925
01:27:53,651 --> 01:27:57,380
and you've limited it because it's too 
you built around you as an individual in

1926
01:27:57,381 --> 01:27:58,520
your perspective,
et cetera.

1927
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:03,850
But these are,
there are ways now of getting 

1928
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:03,850
information out there that excites me.
Yeah.

1929
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:04,750
And They should,
you know,

1930
01:28:04,751 --> 01:28:09,751
and what we were talking about too,
about being a hedonist and doing things 

1931
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:11,860
wrong and fucking up.
and what can you learn from them?

1932
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:17,130
I think every time you fuck something up
and every time you do something badly 

1933
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:17,920
you,
there's a lesson that you get out of the

1934
01:28:17,921 --> 01:28:21,130
weird feelings of failure,
of discontent.

1935
01:28:21,131 --> 01:28:23,710
And those lessons are extremely 
valuable.

1936
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:26,140
You know,
a person who doesn't make mistakes and a

1937
01:28:26,141 --> 01:28:28,810
person who doesn't do anything wrong,
they never learned shit.

1938
01:28:28,811 --> 01:28:31,300
You don't learn anything from doing 
everything perfectly.

1939
01:28:31,301 --> 01:28:36,301
every time it doesn't happen.
No one knew no one and the more bold and

1940
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:41,311
brash you are and the more you take 
chances and the more you put yourself 

1941
01:28:41,621 --> 01:28:44,190
into these weird positions.
Even in these like,

1942
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:45,780
you know,
I'm sure when you're,

1943
01:28:45,781 --> 01:28:50,781
you were a sex addict and you're in this
hedonistic whirlwind experience,

1944
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:56,160
you're still,
you're taking in all this data and 

1945
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:59,521
you're taking all this in,
in the hollow feeling that you had that 

1946
01:28:59,521 --> 01:29:02,191
you didn't like.
It is what propelled you to your new 

1947
01:29:02,191 --> 01:29:02,191
stage of once you

1948
01:29:02,191 --> 01:29:03,360
emerge from it.
Yeah,

1949
01:29:03,361 --> 01:29:08,361
that's right.
Every so often because it's like 

1950
01:29:08,361 --> 01:29:08,930
pleasure laden an orgy.
I mean that's the point of view.

1951
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:10,770
I mean this flesh everywhere.
It's this bits of it.

1952
01:29:10,771 --> 01:29:12,690
They're brilliant.
I was no in,

1953
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:17,720
hold on a minute.
This isn't working and this is a thing 

1954
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:17,720
that I thought would really,
really work,

1955
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:18,540
you know,
like sometimes the,

1956
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:23,640
the great gift of promiscuity is you get
to experience the intimacy with all of 

1957
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:27,711
these strangers and it seemed exciting 
and the type of sexuality that I've 

1958
01:29:27,711 --> 01:29:30,420
always had is more about worship than 
any kind of domination I adore.

1959
01:29:30,421 --> 01:29:31,740
I adore,
you know,

1960
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:33,330
so it's not about like,
I want to control you,

1961
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:37,290
so by like all these wonderful 
experiences and encounters,

1962
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:42,530
but within it,
this kind of ongoing seem of loneliness 

1963
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:45,150
and ignorable and also this is the 
thing,

1964
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:50,270
when you get the things your culture 
tells you you should be doing and you 

1965
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:53,601
experience them now you know,
now you know you can stop chasing the 

1966
01:29:53,601 --> 01:29:53,850
carrot because you've had a bite out of 
it.

1967
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:54,330
And he's like,
oh,

1968
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:55,920
mini bullshit,
like you know,

1969
01:29:56,110 --> 01:30:01,110
not an,
it's a hard one to learn because 

1970
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:01,110
anything that's got an orgasm at the end
of it,

1971
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:01,650
you know,
there's a degree of pleasure to be had,

1972
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,620
but it takes,
it takes a while to recognize what this,

1973
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:07,440
the emotional cost or made a spiritual 
cost on other people.

1974
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:09,930
The fact that it's prevented me from 
becoming a father,

1975
01:30:09,931 --> 01:30:12,010
from becoming a husband,
from berlin,

1976
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:14,740
from becoming rooted from becoming 
actually whole,

1977
01:30:14,741 --> 01:30:16,890
from becoming a man,
from becoming connected.

1978
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:22,270
It takes a while to spot that.
I think a lot of people don't get the 

1979
01:30:22,270 --> 01:30:23,220
opportunity to break out that pattern.
I would never have spotted it.

1980
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:25,410
Had a not first being a heroin addict 
and got,

1981
01:30:25,411 --> 01:30:27,030
hold on a minute.
You're doing that thing again.

1982
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:30,480
Same with fame and celebrity.
Well toxic,

1983
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,560
well toxic,
exciting and brilliant and loads of 

1984
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:35,560
lovely people in there.

1985
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:35,560
And I still like,
you know,

1986
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:36,630
I might make another film,
I don't know what happened,

1987
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:40,950
but like it's because I'd had the 
template and the experiences of awe,

1988
01:30:40,951 --> 01:30:45,951
this is addiction.
You're expecting this thing to make you 

1989
01:30:45,951 --> 01:30:48,291
feel better.
Now what's happened is I am as a 

1990
01:30:48,291 --> 01:30:50,961
baseline disabused of the idea that the 
material world will give me anything 

1991
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,000
that it will ever fulfill me,
that I am responsible for my own 

1992
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,291
connection and that my role here is to 
serve other people and help them in if 

1993
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:04,890
my objective in life is or what can I do
to augment myself to make myself better.

1994
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:05,700
And I,
you know,

1995
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:08,190
even self improvement.
I agree with all of that.

1996
01:31:08,191 --> 01:31:09,480
I agree with entirely.
It's brilliant,

1997
01:31:09,481 --> 01:31:10,980
brilliant thing and it's necessary I 
think,

1998
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:15,540
but like in order that I may be of 
service to others rather than.

1999
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:18,210
Because then I'll just look great in 
this arm chair ranking.

2000
01:31:18,210 --> 01:31:22,770
Self improvement is about being better 
at what fulfills you the most,

2001
01:31:22,771 --> 01:31:25,020
which is almost always establishing 
community.

2002
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:30,440
So don't you think then joe,
that we could do something that's a bit 

2003
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,961
more explicitly that from the.
You already have this huge community 

2004
01:31:32,961 --> 01:31:37,460
there around the joe rogan experience.
Is there something in it bother you?

2005
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:41,160
Like couldn't there be something that 
wouldn't cost you that much?

2006
01:31:41,161 --> 01:31:43,440
That might be sort of wonderful.
Didn't do these things,

2007
01:31:43,441 --> 01:31:45,090
not float into your world,
and people go,

2008
01:31:45,091 --> 01:31:46,200
you know,
you're an influential figure.

2009
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:48,970
You're unusual.
You have this strong male energy.

2010
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:53,990
Be very open to learning and very open 
to it and you're like,

2011
01:31:54,241 --> 01:31:55,000
you know,
I agree with you.

2012
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,850
A left wing categories right when 
categories,

2013
01:31:56,851 --> 01:32:01,851
that shit's all got to go,
but I think that there's a real 

2014
01:32:01,851 --> 01:32:03,010
opportunity for you to have a huge 
impact on communities.

2015
01:32:03,011 --> 01:32:05,530
They're very neglected.
Young males,

2016
01:32:05,531 --> 01:32:08,890
for example,
not knowing how to use their bodies,

2017
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:12,010
young males are that violence is 
becoming a problem for.

2018
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:17,100
there's not that many people that are in
as powerful position as you to sort of 

2019
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,630
the wrecks to them in a different way.
Is that something that you know about?

2020
01:32:19,631 --> 01:32:22,360
Is that something that's come into your 
orbit?

2021
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:23,140
Well,

2022
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:25,490
you're doing it right now.
I mean,

2023
01:32:25,491 --> 01:32:29,030
you're doing it right now about 
communicating in a way that you're going

2024
01:32:29,031 --> 01:32:31,490
to get to way more people than you're 
going to do it in a physical sense.

2025
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:36,870
You know,
by spreading these ideas and 

2026
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:37,880
communicating online in a podcast and 
allowing people to download it for free.

2027
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:43,120
Getting into your phone and your head 
and you know you're jogging and you're 

2028
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:47,380
driving your car,
you're getting ideas and the way more 

2029
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:50,591
people's heads and you ever would by 
physically being there physically being 

2030
01:32:50,591 --> 01:32:50,720
there.
It's very retro.

2031
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:54,680
It really is.
I mean,

2032
01:32:54,681 --> 01:32:57,050
you can only be there for so many people
and what are you going to do?

2033
01:32:57,051 --> 01:32:58,080
I mean,
I could.

2034
01:32:58,170 --> 01:33:03,170
I do comedy shows for a lot of people,
but I mean physically being there and 

2035
01:33:03,170 --> 01:33:04,250
doing something and organizing some sort
of thing.

2036
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:08,880
That's what you venture into some weird 
cult thing that's for the culture.

2037
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:13,950
Shit gets slippery.
Everybody's covered in baby oil and you 

2038
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:14,200
just fucking trying to grip nothing.

2039
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:16,370
Right?
We're in a jungle now.

2040
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:23,220
Massively side may be a right job.
I think it's an interesting thing to 

2041
01:33:23,391 --> 01:33:28,391
observe.
I do think that's right and it made a 

2042
01:33:28,391 --> 01:33:28,391
lot of people in england like the go.
Yeah.

2043
01:33:28,391 --> 01:33:28,790
Yeah.
I heard you on joe rogan.

2044
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:33,830
I listen to joe rogan.
People talk about it and it's 

2045
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:35,711
interesting because it's different,
like it's accessing information that 

2046
01:33:35,711 --> 01:33:40,061
people would not have always been.
People come for the fight stuff or come 

2047
01:33:40,061 --> 01:33:41,150
for the entertainers,
but then they're getting hit with graham

2048
01:33:41,151 --> 01:33:46,151
hancock or some neurologist or wherever 
the behavioralist or wherever is a good 

2049
01:33:46,151 --> 01:33:47,030
thing.
Well,

2050
01:33:47,031 --> 01:33:47,320
I think

2051
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:50,260
the wide variety of guests is very 
important too,

2052
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:55,290
for me personally because otherwise I'd 
get bored if I only talk to comedians 

2053
01:33:55,290 --> 01:33:56,020
are only talked to mma fighters or 
whatever,

2054
01:33:56,021 --> 01:33:58,120
or even only cocked to scientist.
I'd get bored.

2055
01:33:58,380 --> 01:33:59,140
You know,
I like,

2056
01:33:59,410 --> 01:34:01,300
I like talking to a bunch of different 
people.

2057
01:34:01,301 --> 01:34:02,860
You know what I mean?
I didn't plan any of this.

2058
01:34:02,861 --> 01:34:07,861
So the way that sort of an an folded is,
is been pretty organic to use an 

2059
01:34:10,601 --> 01:34:11,150
overused.

2060
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:18,240
tell me please just briefly,
is there something about the phenomena 

2061
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:21,040
of conor mcgregor that is unique?
what is it that is happening?

2062
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:23,620
What has happened with him?
What does he mean?

2063
01:34:23,621 --> 01:34:28,621
What does he mean into ufc?
What happens to him now that I'll post 

2064
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:33,800
mayweather fight?
What is he an example of sort of an 

2065
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:33,850
outlier,
a pioneer?

2066
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:36,580
How will he be regarded?
What does he represent?

2067
01:34:36,581 --> 01:34:38,680
Is he an entertainment product?
Easy.

2068
01:34:38,681 --> 01:34:41,410
A great athlete is a combination of all 
those things.

2069
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:46,560
What does he mean for the sport of ufc 
and what do you think will happen in 

2070
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:50,880
mixed martial arts and boxing?
Do you think we'll see more of those 

2071
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:50,880
kinds of events?
Well,

2072
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,270
you never going to see another one like 
him,

2073
01:34:52,330 --> 01:34:53,640
right?
Because he's a unique

2074
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:54,380
person.
He's.

2075
01:34:54,410 --> 01:34:59,410
He's literally being himself.
You're going see a bunch of people try 

2076
01:34:59,410 --> 01:35:03,341
to mimic that and in a sense he sort of 
mimicked the people that came before 

2077
01:35:03,341 --> 01:35:07,811
him,
like the chill sonance and the muhammad 

2078
01:35:07,811 --> 01:35:07,811
ali's and the people that were really 
good at talking shit.

2079
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:11,570
The difference is that what connor's 
been able to do,

2080
01:35:11,571 --> 01:35:14,930
he's the first guy in the ufc that's 
been able to do that,

2081
01:35:14,931 --> 01:35:19,931
that's had spectacular results and also 
showed his real character in losing and 

2082
01:35:21,351 --> 01:35:26,351
then coming back and winning very 
quickly afterwards at the same guy like 

2083
01:35:26,351 --> 01:35:30,131
the nate diaz fight.
I think that was a very important 

2084
01:35:30,131 --> 01:35:31,850
character exposing fight because he lost
a fight.

2085
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:36,851
He got humbled and then he jumped right 
back on the horse and then wound up 

2086
01:35:36,851 --> 01:35:38,900
winning and then he comes back and blows
eddie alvarez out of the water to become

2087
01:35:38,901 --> 01:35:43,250
the first two division concurrent 
champion in the sport.

2088
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:48,490
I think he's a unique guy in a very.
It's almost like we don't have a word 

2089
01:35:48,591 --> 01:35:53,591
strong enough.
Unique is not really a strong enough 

2090
01:35:53,591 --> 01:35:55,991
word.
So he is founded on a belief in a very 

2091
01:35:55,991 --> 01:35:55,991
basic way.
He's got brilliant,

2092
01:35:55,991 --> 01:35:56,700
brilliant ability,
massive.

2093
01:35:56,780 --> 01:36:01,780
He's incredibly smart and a very.
He's very innovative in his techniques 

2094
01:36:03,141 --> 01:36:05,370
and his approaches.
And um,

2095
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:09,620
I think he has phenomenal coaching as 
well.

2096
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:12,770
And animal movements.
The fuck is that walk well,

2097
01:36:12,771 --> 01:36:14,690
he's just getting that thing that he 
does.

2098
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:19,720
He throws his name doesn't mean anything
loose.

2099
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:24,680
He's doing.
He cocking okay.

2100
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:29,900
When I come out and stay sometimes it 
says just an amazing thing to do with 

2101
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:30,290
the body heat cooking.
You say cocky.

2102
01:36:30,430 --> 01:36:31,340
I was like,
oh my god,

2103
01:36:31,341 --> 01:36:33,200
these guys fucking out and look what 
he's doing.

2104
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:35,360
He's letting the other guy know that he 
so loose.

2105
01:36:35,370 --> 01:36:39,170
You can kind of struck with his arms 
like rubber bands flying around,

2106
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:41,600
but I mean he's a combination of a lot 
of things.

2107
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:46,600
He has a brilliant team.
John kavanagh is coach is a brilliant 

2108
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:46,600
coach.
She's got,

2109
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,420
you know,
amazing jujitsu,

2110
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:50,480
coaching and striking coaching in his 
mind.

2111
01:36:50,481 --> 01:36:53,060
He just,
he understands how to apply these things

2112
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:55,110
and his ability to perform under 
pressure.

2113
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:58,460
This is fantastic.
You saw that in the mayweather fight.

2114
01:36:58,790 --> 01:37:03,790
I mean even though he lost that fight,
he hit me with some pretty good shots 

2115
01:37:03,790 --> 01:37:07,790
and he won the first three rounds 
against the greatest boxer of all time.

2116
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:09,500
So then the extraordinary,
extraordinary.

2117
01:37:09,501 --> 01:37:14,501
I mean you can say easily that made 
whether it was taking those rounds off 

2118
01:37:14,501 --> 01:37:14,501
and I agree he was,
and you could say that may,

2119
01:37:14,501 --> 01:37:19,341
whether it was bringing them to deep 
water because he knew it would exhaust 

2120
01:37:19,341 --> 01:37:21,841
him because he didn't give him enough 
time to train for it because you really 

2121
01:37:21,841 --> 01:37:21,841
only gave them two months.
It was very brilliant.

2122
01:37:21,841 --> 01:37:22,760
I made with his part.
He knew that he wouldn't be efficient.

2123
01:37:22,761 --> 01:37:25,280
He would tire.
Although as a kinetic,

2124
01:37:25,281 --> 01:37:29,510
big explosive movements at conor likes 
to do their very taxing and he knew that

2125
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:34,630
he was not going to have the efficiency 
to go 12 hard rounds with a master 

2126
01:37:34,630 --> 01:37:35,900
defensive fighter like mayweather and 
made whether it was right,

2127
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:38,870
but he didn't want to get hit with that 
upper cut that he got cracked within the

2128
01:37:38,871 --> 01:37:43,871
first round.
He didn't want to to to like connor's 

2129
01:37:43,871 --> 01:37:47,090
movement was very unusual.
It took floyd a while to decipher.

2130
01:37:47,091 --> 01:37:52,091
It has been way better for him if he 
just blew connor out of the water from 

2131
01:37:52,091 --> 01:37:53,780
one round on and just completely 
outclassed him.

2132
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:58,960
But he didn't.
And one of the reasons why I didn't is 

2133
01:37:58,960 --> 01:37:59,250
because connor's an extraordinary person
and he has greatness.

2134
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:04,820
Greatness.
I mean he didn't really have the proper 

2135
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:07,161
opportunity in only being able to 
prepare for two months and only having 

2136
01:38:07,161 --> 01:38:08,670
this one professional boxing match.

2137
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:12,060
There was a lot of things stacked 
against him and yet I feel,

2138
01:38:12,061 --> 01:38:14,910
although he clearly lost,
he performed admirably.

2139
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:17,490
I don't think it hurts his stock in any 
way.

2140
01:38:17,491 --> 01:38:21,180
I think it elevates them and I think his
next fight in the ufc,

2141
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:26,440
a whoever it would will be will be 
probably the biggest fight in ufc 

2142
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,020
history if they can do it correctly,
depending upon who it is,

2143
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:33,170
especially if it's nate diaz.
Nate diaz is a huge name and if nate 

2144
01:38:33,170 --> 01:38:34,260
diaz and him decided to do it one more 
time,

2145
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:37,200
I think that would be the biggest fight 
ever in the historY of the sport because

2146
01:38:37,201 --> 01:38:39,870
I think connor has eclipsed the sport 
largely,

2147
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:40,600
you know,
and,

2148
01:38:40,601 --> 01:38:45,601
and maybe for now maybe someone else 
will come along in the next year or two 

2149
01:38:45,601 --> 01:38:45,690
that,
that does it.

2150
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:48,000
I mean look has only been around for a 
few years.

2151
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:53,390
I tweeted to him in 2013 or 14,
I forget what it was when he had won a 

2152
01:38:55,261 --> 01:39:00,261
big fight in the uk and I said,
congratulations on an amazing 

2153
01:39:00,261 --> 01:39:00,261
performance.

2154
01:39:00,261 --> 01:39:02,970
I really hope to see in the ufc someday.
That was like four years ago.

2155
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,290
Oh my god.
The most.

2156
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:09,470
So in four years he's gone from being 
this unknown fighter that only like the 

2157
01:39:09,470 --> 01:39:13,340
really hardcore fanatics,
like myself knew about to him being this

2158
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:19,110
worldwide phenomena.
He's the biggest combat sport athlete,

2159
01:39:19,111 --> 01:39:20,850
not just of today,
ever.

2160
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:23,670
There's no one like him.
No one like him,

2161
01:39:23,671 --> 01:39:26,010
no one that has the kind of popularity 
that he has.

2162
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:31,220
I mean,
this fucking guy has thousands and 

2163
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:32,400
thousands of people fly from Ireland to 
vegas.

2164
01:39:32,401 --> 01:39:35,880
Every time he fights the weigh ins.
It seems like you're in dublin.

2165
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,740
I mean,
it's fucking crazy,

2166
01:39:37,741 --> 01:39:39,150
man.
When you look out,

2167
01:39:39,151 --> 01:39:41,730
when I,
when I interview him at the weigh ins in

2168
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:43,560
the ufc in vegas,
you look out,

2169
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:48,561
you see nothing but irish flags.
You see people screaming and cheering 

2170
01:39:48,561 --> 01:39:50,280
and singing.
Mandalay bay during the floyd mayweather

2171
01:39:50,281 --> 01:39:55,281
fight,
which is not even the venue where the 

2172
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:55,320
fight was being held.
Mandalay bay was packed.

2173
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:59,790
Bumper to bumper with irishman walking 
down the hallway,

2174
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:04,110
cheering and singing songs in sync.
It was insane.

2175
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:06,150
Brilliant.
There's no one like him.

2176
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:06,880
Is that.
First of all,

2177
01:40:06,881 --> 01:40:09,430
you have to have the greatness.
Like we've had the greatest.

2178
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:14,440
Who gives a fuck?
He's just another person because like I 

2179
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:14,440
said about van gough,
you know,

2180
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:14,440
like,
you know,

2181
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:18,550
it gives a fuck if you cut your ear off,
if you paint paintings,

2182
01:40:18,551 --> 01:40:20,950
have god be good,
game is good,

2183
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:25,360
but then like the law,
there are often great geniuses in sport,

2184
01:40:25,361 --> 01:40:26,710
but to have that,
like you say,

2185
01:40:26,711 --> 01:40:31,711
this fall that he used like that 
romantic ideas of Ireland and he's an 

2186
01:40:31,961 --> 01:40:36,961
irish ness,
that became an important part of his 

2187
01:40:36,961 --> 01:40:36,961
perception,
but it's obviously resonating in a very,

2188
01:40:36,961 --> 01:40:40,420
very powerful way to have that kind of 
devotion or Ireland.

2189
01:40:40,421 --> 01:40:40,530
Ireland's

2190
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:45,550
very important.
Ireland's a very important part of the 

2191
01:40:45,550 --> 01:40:48,101
equation as well because their 
appreciation and love and support of 

2192
01:40:48,261 --> 01:40:49,550
him.
It's unprecedented.

2193
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:54,310
I mean,
I've seen brazilian fans that love josie

2194
01:40:54,311 --> 01:40:58,030
aldo and I've seen brazilian fans that 
love anderson silva and you know,

2195
01:40:58,031 --> 01:41:03,031
the worshiped by their countrymen,
but it pales in comparison to the amount

2196
01:41:03,581 --> 01:41:05,050
of love that conor mcgregor gatz.

2197
01:41:05,190 --> 01:41:09,000
I understand.
Then then myth aligns with his myth,

2198
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:14,030
the myth of the irish people as being 
oppressed by british colonialism and 

2199
01:41:14,030 --> 01:41:17,841
having to fight for their freedom.
It resonates with what this man 

2200
01:41:17,841 --> 01:41:21,210
represents and perhaps this is always 
what happens with figures of greatness,

2201
01:41:21,211 --> 01:41:24,810
whether it's within the realm of sport 
or within the realm of politics,

2202
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:28,200
temporarily a person sort of captures a 
particular mood,

2203
01:41:28,201 --> 01:41:30,060
a particular energy,
and this is what I think again,

2204
01:41:30,061 --> 01:41:33,410
is to do with unconsciousness.
I don't think people are go like a con,

2205
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,550
like are aware of these kinds of 
feelings.

2206
01:41:35,551 --> 01:41:38,990
I think it's stimulated on a level 
that's not about for.

2207
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:44,270
This is one of the things I'm very 
interested in what lies beyond the 

2208
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:44,270
rational.
You know,

2209
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:45,000
what lexia,
we can equate,

2210
01:41:45,001 --> 01:41:45,930
we can work out,
we can just.

2211
01:41:45,931 --> 01:41:50,931
But there seems to be some ingredient 
even in conor mcgregor that you can't 

2212
01:41:50,931 --> 01:41:50,931
quite pin down.

2213
01:41:50,931 --> 01:41:51,030
Yes,
there's the greatness as a boxer.

2214
01:41:51,031 --> 01:41:52,140
Yes.
The irish people,

2215
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:57,270
you know,
but there's also some flavor is being 

2216
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:58,050
caught and I wonder if you can ever 
preempt or understand these things.

2217
01:41:58,051 --> 01:42:03,051
I wOnder if you can ever drill down,
but like the sort of the work of Joseph 

2218
01:42:03,051 --> 01:42:03,450
Campbell,
the work of Carl Young,

2219
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:04,620
the worker bees people to say,
oh,

2220
01:42:04,621 --> 01:42:07,590
they are unconscious archetypes.
There are unconscious themes,

2221
01:42:07,591 --> 01:42:10,020
there were stories that are running 
below the surface,

2222
01:42:10,021 --> 01:42:13,110
patterns,
coordInates that can be connected to.

2223
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:18,320
Some people will not believe the 
profession of in know how to harness 

2224
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:22,911
these energies.
If you have enough people feeling not 

2225
01:42:22,911 --> 01:42:26,031
good enough,
they will spend money trying to feel 

2226
01:42:26,031 --> 01:42:29,241
better,
whether it's the purchase of a car or a 

2227
01:42:29,241 --> 01:42:30,270
coffee or whatever it is.
One of the key ingredient is make people

2228
01:42:30,271 --> 01:42:35,271
feel not good enough.
If you can rehab and redirect people's 

2229
01:42:35,271 --> 01:42:38,441
sexual eNergy so that their sexual 
energy is directed at products and 

2230
01:42:38,441 --> 01:42:39,810
consumerism,
then you will sell Your product.

2231
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:43,440
But for me it seems like such a shame to
waste this force,

2232
01:42:43,441 --> 01:42:48,441
to waste this knowledge,
to waste his energy just to turn people 

2233
01:42:48,441 --> 01:42:52,191
into consumers just to turn everything 
on this planet into a commodity when 

2234
01:42:52,191 --> 01:42:55,710
what we could be doing is using these 
energy to imagine new worlds,

2235
01:42:55,711 --> 01:42:58,980
to imagine new systems,
to use our greatness,

2236
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:01,560
to use our greatness to.
I don't know,

2237
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:04,710
Joe Love one another to create new 
tribes.

2238
01:43:04,770 --> 01:43:05,700
I mean,
I don't know if he.

2239
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:06,210
You.
Boy,

2240
01:43:06,211 --> 01:43:07,840
you tied a lot of things together.
There was.

2241
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:13,310
It was pretty,
pretty good rent that coffee's really 

2242
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:13,320
kicked in and actually that's no joke.
That's serious.

2243
01:43:13,321 --> 01:43:18,321
I think I could do another one.
I think I won't fucking handling 250 

2244
01:43:18,321 --> 01:43:18,321
milligrams.
I'll mainland this shit.

2245
01:43:18,321 --> 01:43:21,820
I'll pour mii you want another one?
I do like it.

2246
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:26,830
You do have a terrible drug problem.
It is a drug.

2247
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:29,540
I mean,
what were you saying about connor's?

2248
01:43:29,541 --> 01:43:32,930
I think undeniable.
He's a hero and he dares to be great.

2249
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:36,170
I mean he dares to be great in a way 
that very few people do and he stands in

2250
01:43:36,171 --> 01:43:41,171
front of the opponent and looks at the 
entire crowd and goes and goes like that

2251
01:43:41,631 --> 01:43:46,631
and puts his hands up like that.
I mean literally is like some 

2252
01:43:46,631 --> 01:43:47,240
archetypical fixture figure from the 
past.

2253
01:43:47,241 --> 01:43:52,241
I mean beautiful.
I mean what he's also doing by doing 

2254
01:43:52,241 --> 01:43:52,241
that,
he's like,

2255
01:43:52,241 --> 01:43:55,970
he's letting the opponent realize like 
you're in there with greatness.

2256
01:43:55,971 --> 01:43:58,490
You're in there with someone who's 
incredibly comfortable in the moment and

2257
01:43:58,491 --> 01:44:02,180
someone who truly believes that he's 
great and the results that he's had,

2258
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:05,890
like you can't deny that they have a 
factor in,

2259
01:44:05,891 --> 01:44:08,270
in his future success and in the way 
people love them,

2260
01:44:08,271 --> 01:44:13,271
the way knocked out.
Although with one punch to win the 

2261
01:44:13,271 --> 01:44:14,300
title,
I mean this giant buildup over this long

2262
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:17,270
period of time and then he just fucking 
starches them with one shot,

2263
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:20,420
13 seconds of the fight and the 
deafening roar.

2264
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:25,421
The irish in that arena,
when that happened was it was fucking 

2265
01:44:25,421 --> 01:44:25,421
insane.
He's like a hero,

2266
01:44:25,421 --> 01:44:26,300
like a mythical creature.

2267
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:31,710
I suppose the role of the hero is to 
embody and represent some inspire to 

2268
01:44:32,910 --> 01:44:35,370
inspire,
inspire the crowd to put me right.

2269
01:44:35,860 --> 01:44:37,690
Those people,
those 15,000

2270
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:42,720
plus people that saw that fight,
who knows how much energy that gave them

2271
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:47,350
to then go forth and pursue their own 
dreams because that's a big part of what

2272
01:44:47,351 --> 01:44:52,351
heroes represent.
What a what a big part of someone who's 

2273
01:44:52,351 --> 01:44:55,800
accomplishing anything spectacular.
It's not just that people get to watch 

2274
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,040
it and get this thrill of watching this 
experience,

2275
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:00,760
but also that you get energized to go 
and pursue your own ideas.

2276
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:00,870
Yes,

2277
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:01,890
yes.
This is true.

2278
01:45:01,891 --> 01:45:02,940
I agree.
But,

2279
01:45:02,941 --> 01:45:07,941
uh,
I think an integral component of the 

2280
01:45:07,941 --> 01:45:09,960
mythic figure of the hero is sacrificing
fucking credit.

2281
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:15,180
I'm in the bloody world judge conor 
mcgregor and any stage from any angle 

2282
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:15,180
because people that are brave enough to 
do that,

2283
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:17,360
it's fucking unbelievable.
But like the,

2284
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:22,820
what I've felt it while it resonates,
we've asked when somebody is willing to 

2285
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:26,601
sacrifice themselves is because it 
temporarily makes us recognize when 

2286
01:45:26,601 --> 01:45:28,230
someone's willing to die for what they 
believe in.

2287
01:45:28,231 --> 01:45:29,100
Whether that is,
you know,

2288
01:45:29,101 --> 01:45:34,101
these civil rights leaders and miserable
for malcolm x knew he was going to die 

2289
01:45:34,101 --> 01:45:35,790
for doing that.
And he did it anyway.

2290
01:45:35,970 --> 01:45:38,430
Gandy had a good sense that he was going
to die.

2291
01:45:38,610 --> 01:45:43,020
He did it anyway because what he 
believed in was more important than what

2292
01:45:43,021 --> 01:45:45,780
he was as an individual.
And I think that when that happens,

2293
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,220
it reminds us,
oh,

2294
01:45:47,221 --> 01:45:49,050
there's something like you say,
inspire.

2295
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:54,200
It puts breath into us.
It reminds us we have the capacity for 

2296
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:55,320
greatness and we are not just contained 
by our body.

2297
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:58,500
We all these streams of energy in that 
moment,

2298
01:45:58,501 --> 01:46:01,410
perhaps there is no disconnection 
between conor mcgregor in that crowd.

2299
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:06,090
There is a oneness of purpose in that 
single punch punching for all of them in

2300
01:46:06,091 --> 01:46:11,091
that moment.
The only thing that saddens me is that 

2301
01:46:11,091 --> 01:46:13,360
is ultimately not ultimately,
but at least seemingly housed by an 

2302
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:17,780
economic idea.
That's the old thing that prisons are 

2303
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:17,780
the sort of contains it.
Do you know what I mean?

2304
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:20,610
You got to pay money to go there.
Ultimately,

2305
01:46:20,611 --> 01:46:25,611
it's a commodified thing.
Conor mcgregor is a commodity that all 

2306
01:46:25,611 --> 01:46:27,090
that makes people aware of the stakes 
that are at hand,

2307
01:46:27,091 --> 01:46:29,250
that makes people aware of the magnitude
of the event.

2308
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:32,550
If you can get pack 22,000
people into an arena like that,

2309
01:46:32,551 --> 01:46:34,650
it makes people aware of the magnitude 
of it all.

2310
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:37,290
If it just happens on a soccer field,
no one's watching.

2311
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:38,490
It's not the same.
No,

2312
01:46:38,491 --> 01:46:43,491
you're quite right.
I'm not criticizing the crowd because 

2313
01:46:43,491 --> 01:46:44,460
they're or because the crowd is 
important and that's what it's doing.

2314
01:46:44,461 --> 01:46:49,461
It's representing something bigger,
but I feel like it's a shame and I feel 

2315
01:46:49,461 --> 01:46:54,100
I say when you take it like we've taken 
into the arts because there's more 

2316
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:56,691
sensitivity,
it's more cerebral and it's less 

2317
01:46:56,691 --> 01:46:57,210
embodied,
so ca qubein.

2318
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:58,350
He's like someone like,
you know,

2319
01:46:58,351 --> 01:47:00,660
like someone in the matrix waking up in 
their pod.

2320
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:03,290
He woke up in the pot of fuck,
you know,

2321
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:08,300
he knew he was a genius.
He knew that he was connecting with 

2322
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:11,661
people.
He knew it was representing something 

2323
01:47:11,661 --> 01:47:12,790
and we also use mentally ill and a drug 
addict and he killed himself and it.

2324
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:17,800
But I think that there is a sort of a 
comparison there that he knew that he 

2325
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:17,940
was becoming commodified.

2326
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:22,050
He was being reduced to a commodity.
He woke up in the pod and for our fuck,

2327
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:24,660
all of these things that are coming from
my heart,

2328
01:47:24,661 --> 01:47:26,400
this truth,
I isolation,

2329
01:47:26,401 --> 01:47:31,401
alienation,
the kinds of things that he was singing 

2330
01:47:31,401 --> 01:47:31,401
about,
that in itself became a product.

2331
01:47:31,401 --> 01:47:35,660
The machine can handle it.
The machine can take people talking 

2332
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:38,991
about that connecting to people's 
deepest fears of India that inadequacy 

2333
01:47:38,991 --> 01:47:41,640
and worthlessness and it can turn that 
into a product and sell it to them.

2334
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:46,760
I think you're getting caught up in 
money as always being a negative anD I 

2335
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:50,931
think connor is actually eMbrace The 
money as a part of the narrative and I 

2336
01:47:50,931 --> 01:47:55,371
think you know another person who's done
that without bragging about that as 

2337
01:47:55,371 --> 01:47:58,371
manny pacquiao,
manny pacquiao was made hundreds of 

2338
01:47:58,371 --> 01:48:02,090
millions of dollars in the same form,
has actually used that to spread well 

2339
01:48:02,090 --> 01:48:05,040
throughout the Philippines and hands out
money to people and he's famously.

2340
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:10,360
I'm generous in that regard and I think 
with connor's done is it's part of his 

2341
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:14,841
hero mythologies and he's sitting on a.
He's sitting on a throne on a pile of 

2342
01:48:14,841 --> 01:48:16,440
gold.
It's really a part of it all.

2343
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:17,850
He's a king.
He is a hero.

2344
01:48:17,851 --> 01:48:20,610
Now the heart of the story,
I'm not criticizing him as an individual

2345
01:48:20,611 --> 01:48:22,840
and saying,
conor mcgregor the money.

2346
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:24,410
Yes,
but I'm criticizing the seed.

2347
01:48:24,470 --> 01:48:29,470
Money is a part of the story.
It's not necessarily negative and I 

2348
01:48:29,470 --> 01:48:32,520
don't think it is negative at all,
but joe money is literally a symbol.

2349
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:34,920
It is nothing but that represent 
something.

2350
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:39,950
I promised to pay the bearer.
we believe this is one up in semantics 

2351
01:48:39,950 --> 01:48:41,850
because he could definitely go out and 
buy a house with that.

2352
01:48:41,851 --> 01:48:46,851
Money is real as fuck.
Like he can go out and buy mansions and 

2353
01:48:46,851 --> 01:48:48,180
cars.
It's real as fuck.

2354
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:52,050
The idea that it represents like,
I promise to give you this.

2355
01:48:52,051 --> 01:48:53,190
Yes,
it's a promissory note,

2356
01:48:53,191 --> 01:48:54,840
but it's fucking real.
You know,

2357
01:48:54,841 --> 01:48:57,750
he has all that.
He has 100 million dollars.

2358
01:48:57,870 --> 01:49:02,870
It is a part of the store.
He is sitting on a throne on a pile of 

2359
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:03,570
gold.
He does have a crown,

2360
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:06,990
is a crown on his fucking neck.
I mean it's real.

2361
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:13,300
I'm not like,
like I don't see conor mcgregor is the 

2362
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:14,260
terminus of this point.
I see.

2363
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:19,430
I see.
This is an opportunity to critique what 

2364
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:22,950
the culture is telling us and what the 
culture is doing to us.

2365
01:49:22,951 --> 01:49:23,750
They're,
you know,

2366
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,110
I understand that,
you know,

2367
01:49:25,111 --> 01:49:28,410
with money you can acquire goods and 
services,

2368
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:33,240
but what I'm saying is,
is that our system for evaluate in worth

2369
01:49:33,270 --> 01:49:38,270
has become about commodities instead of 
perhaps about beauty or about love.

2370
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:39,630
Not like,
you know,

2371
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:44,690
I'm not saying that conor mcgregor 
should give away all this money and 

2372
01:49:44,690 --> 01:49:44,690
start marchIng around a be the new jesus
of Ireland.

2373
01:49:44,690 --> 01:49:46,710
Then that will be fucking fascinating to
watch unfold.

2374
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,010
I'm saying that isn't

2375
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:52,090
it discussed question,
is it not a little unfortunate,

2376
01:49:52,270 --> 01:49:57,270
but greatness is ultimately given to us 
as a product that that is how it is 

2377
01:49:57,581 --> 01:49:59,470
received.
That's how it's understood.

2378
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:04,710
Is it possible that there will be other 
ways of demonstrating greatness as he 

2379
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:05,760
does?
you know when he's fighting?

2380
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:07,750
Yes,
kurt cobain did when he was playing,

2381
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:11,560
but ultimately the dominant thing,
that dominant puppet here,

2382
01:50:11,561 --> 01:50:14,080
the thing pulling the strings is the 
dollar.

2383
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:15,280
I don't tHink it is.

2384
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:18,220
I think it's a part of the story.
Much like you know,

2385
01:50:18,221 --> 01:50:20,200
your clothes are a part of,
you know,

2386
01:50:20,201 --> 01:50:23,110
what you look like.
I don't think it's the dominant thing.

2387
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:26,080
I think it's a big part of how you sell 
it,

2388
01:50:26,290 --> 01:50:28,150
like this is going to be the biggest 
fight ever.

2389
01:50:28,151 --> 01:50:31,870
He's going to make x million dollars and
the way condamine,

2390
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:34,090
but connor uses that as a part of his 
narrative.

2391
01:50:34,130 --> 01:50:37,210
He drives around in a drop top bentley 
and he's,

2392
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:39,970
you know,
he's got beautiful watches and suits and

2393
01:50:39,971 --> 01:50:41,650
say fuck you,
and pin striping.

2394
01:50:41,651 --> 01:50:46,651
I mean it's part of what he's done by.
By creating this incredible mythology 

2395
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:53,760
mean.
I don't think it's necessarily in any 

2396
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:53,760
way,
shape or form negative.

2397
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:53,760
I think it's a part of the story.

2398
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:54,990
Say with hip hop,
right?

2399
01:50:54,991 --> 01:50:59,991
This is possibly a similar way of 
looking at the same idea and this isn't 

2400
01:50:59,991 --> 01:50:59,991
saying I know the answer to.
Do you know what I mean?

2401
01:50:59,991 --> 01:51:00,020
Sure.
I'm not.

2402
01:51:00,021 --> 01:51:03,420
The kind of work is being out and I want
to teach you there.

2403
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:05,700
I'm not going.
I'm trying to fucking work out myself.

2404
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:07,220
Say with hip hop,
hip hop first.

2405
01:51:07,230 --> 01:51:09,930
When it comes out,
it comes out as this angry raw.

2406
01:51:10,050 --> 01:51:11,220
No,
not really pay.

2407
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:13,310
Originally it came out as like a happy 
ron,

2408
01:51:13,450 --> 01:51:16,800
a hip hop hibbett to the hippity hip hop
activity beat.

2409
01:51:16,801 --> 01:51:18,610
Don't stop this bit with

2410
01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:22,850
for combat or at the beginning and then 
like it becomes a social whole.

2411
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:23,560
Yeah,
sure.

2412
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:27,140
Heal and bambara and yesterday early hip
hop pioneers and then we go through this

2413
01:51:27,141 --> 01:51:28,640
sort of that phase of.
Yeah,

2414
01:51:28,641 --> 01:51:30,350
you're right.
It goes through the early part of it.

2415
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:30,910
Jolly

2416
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:34,230
alliance to rap,
gangster rap,

2417
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:39,930
like anger of we are going to have a 
voice straight outta compton.

2418
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:45,020
Amazing.
And then that in itself becomes about 

2419
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:48,220
like what is the subsequent mutations of
hip hop as it becomes sort of claimed by

2420
01:51:48,221 --> 01:51:51,030
a dominant system.
It becomes about jewelry,

2421
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:54,450
bling,
particular attitudes and lou,

2422
01:51:54,510 --> 01:51:57,630
do you not see what I'm saying that 
there's sort of almost like a trend.

2423
01:51:57,660 --> 01:52:02,160
Things get pulled into a certain strand,
a certain way of being.

2424
01:52:02,170 --> 01:52:02,410
It

2425
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:03,970
does,
but it doesn't have to look.

2426
01:52:03,971 --> 01:52:07,330
It didn't with some guys like the really
like here's a perfect example,

2427
01:52:07,331 --> 01:52:09,250
one of the best rappers ever,
nas,

2428
01:52:09,670 --> 01:52:13,450
nas never fell into that.
Nas remains one of the best lyricists of

2429
01:52:13,451 --> 01:52:17,770
all time remains brilliant.
All of his rap has meaning.

2430
01:52:17,771 --> 01:52:19,990
It's creative,
it's interesting.

2431
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:22,900
He doesn't fall into all the bullshit 
and the bling,

2432
01:52:22,901 --> 01:52:26,200
although he has plenty of money and he 
has all the trappings.

2433
01:52:26,410 --> 01:52:31,410
He's got this sort of style about him 
where I believe his father was a jazz 

2434
01:52:31,751 --> 01:52:34,480
musician and he grew up with,
you know,

2435
01:52:34,481 --> 01:52:38,290
with art in his family and he's an 
artist first and foremost,

2436
01:52:38,291 --> 01:52:41,350
and although he's a brilliant rapper,
he's my favorite rapper.

2437
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:46,250
I think that he's never really fallen 
into all the bullshit blang,

2438
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:47,660
mansions,
all that stuff.

2439
01:52:47,661 --> 01:52:52,661
Like the display of it all.
I mean he has these things but it's not 

2440
01:52:52,661 --> 01:52:55,760
the primary display when you're talking 
about nas,

2441
01:52:55,761 --> 01:52:58,970
like as an artist,
as a musician and because again,

2442
01:52:58,971 --> 01:53:03,971
like I suppose what I'm interested in is
how like sort of cultural movements 

2443
01:53:03,971 --> 01:53:08,710
start off.
It seems by saying something that's 

2444
01:53:08,710 --> 01:53:11,771
important and powerful,
whether it's punk or hip hop like 

2445
01:53:11,771 --> 01:53:14,441
becomes a voice to the disembodied or a 
way of conveying a embodied 

2446
01:53:14,441 --> 01:53:18,500
disenfranchised comes a voice for them.
Or like in a similar thing with punk 

2447
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:22,331
punk.
Very observable because it was 

2448
01:53:22,331 --> 01:53:23,120
relatively short term movement.
The bands like the pistols and the clash

2449
01:53:23,121 --> 01:53:28,121
and all these stuff,
these bands come out of england and it 

2450
01:53:28,121 --> 01:53:28,880
quickly became sort of commodified and 
sold back to people.

2451
01:53:28,881 --> 01:53:31,740
What I'm saying is is like that,
and this could be resolved,

2452
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:36,750
this.
I'm now during the second candidate 

2453
01:53:36,750 --> 01:53:36,750
caveman coffee in his skin deep.

2454
01:53:36,750 --> 01:53:38,630
the pimps in my mind.
This is too much for one man.

2455
01:53:38,631 --> 01:53:41,370
I think it's 5:40
for the two kiDs as well.

2456
01:53:41,470 --> 01:53:43,220
Do the dMT now.
I'm almost there.

2457
01:53:43,370 --> 01:53:45,000
So like um,
what I'm saying is,

2458
01:53:45,001 --> 01:53:48,980
is that things start with this original 
germ greatness,

2459
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:54,300
a glory heroism,
but there's anger and there's an 

2460
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:56,750
external system though joe,
that can turn into a product and sell it

2461
01:53:56,751 --> 01:54:01,751
to people.
And I think that that does strip it of 

2462
01:54:01,751 --> 01:54:03,620
its,
of its real value and you all saying,

2463
01:54:03,621 --> 01:54:04,820
I suppose no,
it doesn't matter.

2464
01:54:04,821 --> 01:54:09,821
It doesn't have.
That can just be the architecture of it 

2465
01:54:09,821 --> 01:54:09,821
or the,
the aspects of it.

2466
01:54:09,821 --> 01:54:14,160
And I'm just saying as long as we have a
system that is ultimately about making 

2467
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:16,400
money and turning everything into 
profit.

2468
01:54:16,401 --> 01:54:18,580
And that's what I'm not saying this 
about any of the individualized.

2469
01:54:18,590 --> 01:54:19,700
In fact that's the point I'm making.

2470
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,620
He is great now as this great,
great,

2471
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:24,020
great,
great,

2472
01:54:24,021 --> 01:54:24,410
great,
great.

2473
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:27,410
But ultimately you great me great.
We're like,

2474
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:32,440
please god like a pool.
But everyone's pulled in the direction 

2475
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:33,990
of prophets of like is a thing you've 
got to swIm for.

2476
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:39,010
Like now as we become free,
is there something different that could 

2477
01:54:39,010 --> 01:54:39,050
be done here?
Can something truly glorious?

2478
01:54:39,051 --> 01:54:44,051
Be down here.
Like when you describe that moment of 

2479
01:54:44,051 --> 01:54:45,680
vegas temporarily being overwhelmed 
noise.

2480
01:54:45,681 --> 01:54:48,410
It has been in recent days by tragedy,
death and blood,

2481
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:53,500
but it a glorious spirit of Ireland and 
a hero that isn't the unfortunate that 

2482
01:54:54,591 --> 01:54:59,591
that energy can't be literally used to 
create better worlds,

2483
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:03,110
better systems,
better lives or that really happens is a

2484
01:55:03,111 --> 01:55:05,630
load of people make bunch of money and 
probably.

2485
01:55:05,631 --> 01:55:08,690
And I don't necessarily mean the fucking
protagonists,

2486
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:13,750
you know what I mean?
Like people talk a lot about our 

2487
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:13,750
athletes and too much money I don't 
agree with.

2488
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:15,920
That's one of the few ways that fucking 
ordinary working class people can make a

2489
01:55:15,921 --> 01:55:20,921
lot of money.
But there are people at the top of that 

2490
01:55:20,921 --> 01:55:21,050
chain is siphoning significant amount of
money.

2491
01:55:21,051 --> 01:55:23,270
I've all of those little industries,
you know,

2492
01:55:23,271 --> 01:55:24,090
so.
But that's my question.

2493
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:26,510
Responsible for making it happen in the 
first place.

2494
01:55:26,511 --> 01:55:31,511
I mean you can't leave It up to the 
athletes to put something like that 

2495
01:55:31,511 --> 01:55:31,511
together.
You need a dana,

2496
01:55:31,511 --> 01:55:31,970
why you need a floyd mayweather and 
money.

2497
01:55:32,030 --> 01:55:34,760
The money team productions.
You need people to promote it.

2498
01:55:34,761 --> 01:55:39,761
You need people to put together a press 
junket and a world tour and then you 

2499
01:55:39,761 --> 01:55:41,250
need people to organize the paper view 
and then ben.

2500
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:44,070
Then the real ultimate result is the

2501
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:48,150
inspiration that all the people that 
watch it get the inspiration,

2502
01:55:48,151 --> 01:55:51,480
the entertainment,
and it's completely up to the individual

2503
01:55:51,481 --> 01:55:56,481
whether or not they pursue greatness or 
whether they just pursue money and it's 

2504
01:55:56,481 --> 01:56:00,951
a trap if there's trappings in both ways
is the trappings of greatness with no 

2505
01:56:00,951 --> 01:56:05,751
money.
There's the sadness of someone who dies 

2506
01:56:05,751 --> 01:56:05,751
great,
but penniless and homeless.

2507
01:56:05,751 --> 01:56:10,220
and then there's the guy who just threw 
it all away from money and that never 

2508
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:11,760
ever realized its full potential.
Which is equally sad.

2509
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:16,790
But I think the in that is that we are 
showing a particular aspect of our own 

2510
01:56:17,701 --> 01:56:21,180
conditioning there in believing in the 
myth of the individual,

2511
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:24,150
but the Individual will always try and 
if you have greatness,

2512
01:56:24,151 --> 01:56:29,151
you know.
But like now you did say like the great 

2513
01:56:29,151 --> 01:56:30,950
person that dies penniless know it's a 
kind of a shame that we don't create 

2514
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:34,770
benevolent systems that are helpful to 
the vulnerable.

2515
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,780
Wherever you're talking about sport,
right?

2516
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:39,530
If you're talking about is completely.
I mean,

2517
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:44,600
look,
there has to be some sort of a support 

2518
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:46,431
team behind the individual,
but it's deplete completely dependent 

2519
01:56:46,431 --> 01:56:47,170
upon the individual.
If you don't have john cavanagh,

2520
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:51,460
you don't have a straight blast gym,
you don't have ido portal and then dylan

2521
01:56:51,461 --> 01:56:53,550
dannis and all the different people that
train connor.

2522
01:56:53,551 --> 01:56:56,580
You don't have connor.
But if you have all those things,

2523
01:56:56,581 --> 01:57:01,290
it's entirely dependent upon the one 
individual that takes that knowledge and

2524
01:57:01,291 --> 01:57:06,291
goes in there and performs.
That's what's so scary about It and 

2525
01:57:06,291 --> 01:57:09,231
that's what's so rewarding to people 
that watch it because they know it's so 

2526
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:09,720
dangerous.
It's so crazy.

2527
01:57:09,721 --> 01:57:14,721
It's so fraught with peril to be the one
that's so much lies upon the the one 

2528
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:21,020
that the weight on his shoulders is 
massive and that's one of the most 

2529
01:57:21,020 --> 01:57:24,171
substantial things and the most 
impressive things about connor is the 

2530
01:57:24,171 --> 01:57:27,801
way it handles the weight of the 
pressure that it goes in there and does 

2531
01:57:27,801 --> 01:57:32,361
this in in the giant big moment that he 
stands there in front of everybody and 

2532
01:57:32,361 --> 01:57:36,300
throws his arms out like he's the king 
and then everybody goes fucking crazy.

2533
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:37,730
That he's glorious.
Yes.

2534
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:40,890
It's nothing to do with money.
It seems like it does,

2535
01:57:40,891 --> 01:57:43,200
but money is a part of it all its 
greatness.

2536
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:47,550
Greatness is the thing.
The money is a side effect of greatness.

2537
01:57:47,551 --> 01:57:51,150
That shit when he does that,
I don't mean come on man.

2538
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:56,210
Beautiful case that because I don't ever
want conor mcgregor to listen to this 

2539
01:57:56,210 --> 01:58:00,740
and things like brian's criticized.
We didn't make like fucking shoulders on

2540
01:58:02,461 --> 01:58:04,590
that son of a bitch.
Especially that left.

2541
01:58:04,591 --> 01:58:08,880
No wonder why knocked people dead easy.
It's hard to tell from the angle,

2542
01:58:08,881 --> 01:58:11,590
but big fucks people up at that left 
hand.

2543
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:16,640
Boy,
this is not a critique of any 

2544
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:17,220
individual.
This is my.

2545
01:58:17,610 --> 01:58:22,610
I'm trying to understand how systems 
work and that's why I'm trying to 

2546
01:58:22,610 --> 01:58:25,881
understand and I'm suggesting that 
they're all favorite ways of doing 

2547
01:58:25,881 --> 01:58:27,030
things.
Even they let me say this,

2548
01:58:27,060 --> 01:58:28,950
this system doesn't mean jack shit.

2549
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:32,100
If someone can't rise,
this guy is dIfferent.

2550
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:34,500
Okay?
It's the system exists all day long,

2551
01:58:34,501 --> 01:58:36,090
24 slash seven,
three 65.

2552
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:38,190
The systems going on this weekend in 
vegas,

2553
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:40,080
there's going to be to world title 
fights.

2554
01:58:40,081 --> 01:58:45,081
It's not nearly the amount of attention 
being paid to these two world title 

2555
01:58:45,081 --> 01:58:49,291
fights this weekend is conor mcgregor 
pulling his dick out and taking a piss 

2556
01:58:49,291 --> 01:58:53,971
in a punch bowl.
He could do that on paper view and more 

2557
01:58:53,971 --> 01:58:53,971
people would watch it.
Why?

2558
01:58:53,971 --> 01:58:56,530
Because he's done so much In the past as
an individual.

2559
01:58:56,531 --> 01:58:58,900
The greatness that he is shown,
it's.

2560
01:58:58,930 --> 01:59:02,200
It's more than just money.
It's more than just the system.

2561
01:59:02,201 --> 01:59:06,400
The system exists.
It's a matter of one person figuring out

2562
01:59:06,401 --> 01:59:11,401
the frequency that this system operates 
on and showing this unbelievable 

2563
01:59:12,041 --> 01:59:17,041
performance inside that system and 
that's the individual and that 

2564
01:59:17,041 --> 01:59:18,070
individual is.
When you talk about his past,

2565
01:59:18,071 --> 01:59:18,610
when he,
you know,

2566
01:59:18,611 --> 01:59:23,611
he was,
he was working as a construction worker 

2567
01:59:23,611 --> 01:59:23,611
or as a plumber or some shit and you 
know,

2568
01:59:23,611 --> 01:59:25,780
he'd done some amateur boxing and some 
mma fights.

2569
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:30,780
He was a regular guy.
He grew up in a working class 

2570
01:59:30,780 --> 01:59:30,780
neighborhood.
He wasn't rich.

2571
01:59:30,780 --> 01:59:31,300
He wasn't.
There's nothing substantial about him.

2572
01:59:31,390 --> 01:59:36,390
He even his own parents say they never 
thought that he was going to be this 

2573
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:36,700
guy.
He figured out a way through it.

2574
01:59:36,701 --> 01:59:39,520
He wasn't born the king.
He wasn't some,

2575
01:59:39,550 --> 01:59:41,710
some person who,
you know what,

2576
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:44,740
for whatever reason was gifted with this
existence,

2577
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:47,260
you know,
he worked his way through it,

2578
01:59:47,261 --> 01:59:50,290
figured it out,
and once he got to the greatest stage in

2579
01:59:50,291 --> 01:59:52,210
the world when the pressure was at its 
highest,

2580
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:54,640
he shown like the brightest star in the 
universe.

2581
01:59:54,641 --> 01:59:56,590
And that's What's so exciting about him.

2582
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:59,200
Yes,
I think he's beautiful and fascinating,

2583
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:02,480
but my question is about 
commodification.

2584
02:00:02,870 --> 02:00:04,000
Money freak.
You're free.

2585
02:00:05,730 --> 02:00:07,210
You're not free to amend that,
hold them,

2586
02:00:07,211 --> 02:00:10,930
but when you say you take a look at the 
empty right or take a lot,

2587
02:00:10,931 --> 02:00:15,931
I've taken a few taking it 99 times.
When you have them experiences,

2588
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:19,660
what does it,
when you come back from it,

2589
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:24,430
what is it that you feel about the way 
that systems are organized?

2590
02:00:24,431 --> 02:00:29,431
Do you know?
Do you come back from it quite 

2591
02:00:29,431 --> 02:00:29,431
fatalistic?
Like,

2592
02:00:29,431 --> 02:00:29,431
oh yeah,
that's just the way the world is.

2593
02:00:29,431 --> 02:00:29,431
Do you Think?
Hold on a minute.

2594
02:00:29,431 --> 02:00:31,690
It's fucking mental.
There's so much stuff going on.

2595
02:00:31,691 --> 02:00:34,270
Things could be different,
but I don't think about the way that you

2596
02:00:34,271 --> 02:00:36,130
think about.
I don't think about these systems.

2597
02:00:36,131 --> 02:00:41,131
I think you spent a lot of time thinking
about the elites in the one percent and 

2598
02:00:41,131 --> 02:00:41,131
the systems.

2599
02:00:41,131 --> 02:00:41,740
Um,
I don't,

2600
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:43,990
I don't think about that stuff very 
much.

2601
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:49,150
nor do I think mostly about why I'm 
interested in is god and oneness.

2602
02:00:49,210 --> 02:00:53,290
And I think that greatness is a 
representation of god.

2603
02:00:53,291 --> 02:00:58,291
I think that is coming through conor 
mcgregor or kurt cobain or jimi hendrix 

2604
02:00:58,291 --> 02:01:02,401
or Dorothy Parker is some kind of the 
beauty that that person is the perfect 

2605
02:01:02,711 --> 02:01:07,711
vessel for iconography is the 
realization of greatness or the 

2606
02:01:07,711 --> 02:01:11,180
realization of god in inverted commerce.
Given them this is the singing,

2607
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:13,810
the stO playing the star spangled banner
at woodstock.

2608
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:15,430
unbelievable.
Here is some,

2609
02:01:15,790 --> 02:01:19,540
some moment that pulls us all together.
Now what my curiosity is about the empty

2610
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:24,720
is that does dmt make you experience 
that oneness or that loss of self in a 

2611
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:26,890
way that's kind of religious or 
spiritual?

2612
02:01:26,891 --> 02:01:29,380
What does it do to your tense loss of 
self?

2613
02:01:29,430 --> 02:01:33,050
I mean as intense as any thing,
but it's.

2614
02:01:33,051 --> 02:01:33,210
It's

2615
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:38,310
not even.
I shouldn't say as there's no 

2616
02:01:38,310 --> 02:01:40,851
comparison.
I shouldn't say as intense as anything 

2617
02:01:40,851 --> 02:01:40,851
because there's not a word

2618
02:01:40,851 --> 02:01:42,020
that I could say that's going to come 
out of my mouth.

2619
02:01:42,021 --> 02:01:44,360
It's going to do it justice.
The words haven't been invented.

2620
02:01:44,361 --> 02:01:48,290
They don't exist because it does all 
words that we have created.

2621
02:01:48,291 --> 02:01:51,320
They represent things that we can 
reference in the material world.

2622
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:53,870
When you.
When you have a dmt experience,

2623
02:01:53,871 --> 02:01:55,940
you're literally having a conversation 
with god.

2624
02:01:55,941 --> 02:02:00,941
You're experiencing something that's 
everything and something that's 

2625
02:02:00,941 --> 02:02:02,900
infinitely powerful infinitely wise.
The way I've described it,

2626
02:02:02,901 --> 02:02:07,901
as you're seeing this insane,
infinite world of complex geometric 

2627
02:02:09,711 --> 02:02:11,780
patterns that are made out of love and 
understanding,

2628
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:13,070
right?
Right.

2629
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:17,010
But there's things in there that might 
have these entities.

2630
02:02:17,030 --> 02:02:22,030
He feels something in there that knows 
you and I don't know if it's you that 

2631
02:02:22,030 --> 02:02:26,891
knows you.
It's like you that gets your bullshit 

2632
02:02:26,891 --> 02:02:27,500
separations.
Dissolve is my,

2633
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:32,530
is my.
My suspicion is that there is no 

2634
02:02:32,530 --> 02:02:32,530
separate.
There is no subject object.

2635
02:02:32,530 --> 02:02:34,040
There is only oneness.
Now you yourself just said,

2636
02:02:34,041 --> 02:02:37,490
it's about starts to feel like it's 
about loving and one show.

2637
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:42,910
So that level of consciousness exists.
So my belief is that our systems we 

2638
02:02:42,991 --> 02:02:47,991
have,
our athletic systems are in attainment 

2639
02:02:47,991 --> 02:02:50,051
systems and certainly our economic,
political and social systems should be 

2640
02:02:50,051 --> 02:02:53,261
as close to as possible to that feeling,
but that feeling should be our guiding 

2641
02:02:54,741 --> 02:02:57,620
light.
So I'm not criticizing conor mcgregor,

2642
02:02:57,621 --> 02:03:01,520
the great genius who like I'm fascinated
by and door all kumbaya know anyone.

2643
02:03:01,580 --> 02:03:06,580
I'm just saying,
isn't it odd that you have personally 

2644
02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:08,660
experienced in your way through dmt and 
I have free yoga and meditation and she,

2645
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:09,650
I'm,
when I was a kid,

2646
02:03:09,860 --> 02:03:14,860
they sense of oneness,
this love that seems to transcend my 

2647
02:03:14,860 --> 02:03:18,041
personal form and everything I believe 
in and yet when it comes to our systems 

2648
02:03:18,041 --> 02:03:18,380
for organizing this plane that we live 
on,

2649
02:03:18,381 --> 02:03:23,381
the material plane,
the choices we make are not about that 

2650
02:03:23,381 --> 02:03:25,410
love and understanding there about the 
kind of a,

2651
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:29,330
about resources and elitism,
you know,

2652
02:03:29,331 --> 02:03:31,820
so he's interested in the one percent 
and all that stuff.

2653
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:36,840
I'm a bit interested,
but what more interested in is why are 

2654
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:40,150
our systems not more representative of 
the divine puba truth that we can access

2655
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,890
through spirituality?
Well,

2656
02:03:42,891 --> 02:03:47,891
I think our systems are based on the 
monkey need for survival and this sort 

2657
02:03:47,891 --> 02:03:47,891
of.
That's not good is it?

2658
02:03:47,891 --> 02:03:49,160
We should get beyond that.
Well,

2659
02:03:49,161 --> 02:03:54,161
I think we will,
but I think it takes a long fuCking 

2660
02:03:54,161 --> 02:03:54,161
time.
Just like we were talking about before.

2661
02:03:54,161 --> 02:03:58,901
I mean,
unless you want to get the world to do 

2662
02:03:58,901 --> 02:03:58,901
dmt tomorrow.
I mean,

2663
02:03:58,901 --> 02:03:58,901
if we had a dmt day,
boy,

2664
02:03:58,901 --> 02:04:00,970
that would change a lot of shit.
I'm very interested in that.

2665
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:06,750
I think that's the role of the role of 
the shame and the role of the artist I 

2666
02:04:06,750 --> 02:04:08,150
think is the role of the comic and even 
the role of the shaman.

2667
02:04:08,151 --> 02:04:10,640
I mean that's important point that gets.
That gets distorted.

2668
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:15,640
There's a lot of people that go down to 
south America because they have this 

2669
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:18,881
romantic vision of what a shaman is 
going to do to them and that they're 

2670
02:04:18,881 --> 02:04:18,881
going to go and experience and then 
they.

2671
02:04:18,881 --> 02:04:23,600
They encounter some shyster who really 
just learned how to make iowasca to prey

2672
02:04:23,601 --> 02:04:24,730
on gringos.
I mean that's.

2673
02:04:24,731 --> 02:04:29,731
That's a big,
big part of the narrative that a lot of 

2674
02:04:29,731 --> 02:04:30,370
people experience when they go down and 
do that with the wrong people or.

2675
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:35,600
Yeah,
I'm not happens mainly thing because of 

2676
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:37,500
systems of commodification.
Materialism and profiteering does,

2677
02:04:37,501 --> 02:04:38,310
but it also.

2678
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:41,850
It happens because people are just like 
looking at an opportunity there.

2679
02:04:41,851 --> 02:04:43,010
They're opportunistic.
They're.

2680
02:04:43,011 --> 02:04:45,000
They're desperate.
Maybe they had been mistreated,

2681
02:04:45,001 --> 02:04:46,650
maybe they,
they don't.

2682
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:51,180
They don't have a particularly healthy 
view of human beings.

2683
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:52,530
Well,
I recognize this.

2684
02:04:52,531 --> 02:04:56,190
I'm standing for men in my mind just 
over the course of this conversation.

2685
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:58,140
It's like,
like you said earlier,

2686
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:01,440
there's the potential for good and the 
potential for bad in all of us.

2687
02:05:01,450 --> 02:05:06,450
Sure.
But I see our culture as a magnet and 

2688
02:05:06,450 --> 02:05:09,561
the magnet is pulling out the worst 
stuff and what I think is it would be 

2689
02:05:09,561 --> 02:05:12,360
possible to have a magnet that was 
pulling out the best stuff,

2690
02:05:12,361 --> 02:05:12,870
but it has some

2691
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:14,970
the best of to like what happened in 
houston.

2692
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Okay.
They have this giant hurricane that 

2693
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,651
comes down in houston and I have put my 
friend John Dudley went down down there 

2694
02:05:21,651 --> 02:05:25,191
and brought supplies and was feeding 
people and organized a bunch of other 

2695
02:05:25,191 --> 02:05:28,791
people to help and do the same thing and
there was a ton of people that were 

2696
02:05:28,791 --> 02:05:31,581
doing the same ton of people that were 
donating their time and their money and 

2697
02:05:31,581 --> 02:05:32,880
they were using their boats to help get 
people out of their homes.

2698
02:05:33,030 --> 02:05:35,460
And there's a video that I saw.
There was an amazing video.

2699
02:05:35,461 --> 02:05:37,850
These two guys talking after they didn't
even know each other and they were,

2700
02:05:37,870 --> 02:05:42,870
they were,
they were being interviewed and they 

2701
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:44,511
were saying that the love that they 
experienced helping all these people 

2702
02:05:44,511 --> 02:05:45,660
pull,
pulling them out of the wreckage of this

2703
02:05:45,661 --> 02:05:50,661
horrible natural disaster that was.
It was like nothing they'd ever felt 

2704
02:05:50,661 --> 02:05:54,850
that this love was amazing,
that all these people were being 

2705
02:05:54,850 --> 02:05:54,850
completely altruistic.

2706
02:05:54,850 --> 02:05:58,700
They being completely generous and just 
helping and just the I think in times of

2707
02:05:59,251 --> 02:06:02,430
crisis.
Are you familiar with sebastian younger?

2708
02:06:02,740 --> 02:06:07,740
No.
Sebastian younger is an amazing war 

2709
02:06:07,740 --> 02:06:09,200
journalist and he wrote a great book 
Called tribe and his.

2710
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:14,750
His book is essentially all about how 
human beings really only feel at their 

2711
02:06:16,891 --> 02:06:21,891
best and they're happiest when they are 
coming together to overcome something 

2712
02:06:21,891 --> 02:06:26,150
and so that in this,
in this moment of overcoming this 

2713
02:06:26,150 --> 02:06:29,690
incredible natural disaster that you 
blame it on industrial capitalism and 

2714
02:06:30,241 --> 02:06:35,241
global warming,
blame all that on the fucking the 

2715
02:06:35,241 --> 02:06:35,241
hurricane.
At the end of the day,

2716
02:06:35,241 --> 02:06:36,210
it's a force of nature that no one saw 
coming.

2717
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:38,520
No one can.
There's no one that pulled that trigger.

2718
02:06:38,550 --> 02:06:43,550
Right?
There's a guy in vegas that pulled that 

2719
02:06:43,550 --> 02:06:45,141
trigger,
but there's no one that pulled the 

2720
02:06:45,141 --> 02:06:45,141
trigger on that hurricane.
It was collective.

2721
02:06:45,141 --> 02:06:45,141
It was,
it was.

2722
02:06:45,141 --> 02:06:46,170
It was a thing of nature.

2723
02:06:46,300 --> 02:06:48,780
I don't do that together.
That is beautiful.

2724
02:06:48,781 --> 02:06:53,781
What a coffee.
Agree that anything we're human beings 

2725
02:06:53,781 --> 02:06:55,671
come together like that is glorious.
But both of those examples that you're 

2726
02:06:55,671 --> 02:06:56,380
using as you yourself alluded to,
you know,

2727
02:06:56,390 --> 02:06:59,860
you can look at what conditions create 
hurricane maybe,

2728
02:06:59,910 --> 02:07:00,550
possibly.
Yeah.

2729
02:07:00,551 --> 02:07:01,050
No.
Yeah.

2730
02:07:01,051 --> 02:07:03,090
We don't know.
They could have that hurricane.

2731
02:07:03,150 --> 02:07:07,500
Has hurricanes have happened forever,
but that's my point.

2732
02:07:07,530 --> 02:07:09,990
That's only 50 percent.
The other 50 percent of my point is that

2733
02:07:09,991 --> 02:07:12,840
that guy pulling the trigger isn't just 
an individual.

2734
02:07:12,841 --> 02:07:15,330
He is,
like you said when I was touching you on

2735
02:07:15,331 --> 02:07:16,710
the fucking shaming thing,
they all,

2736
02:07:16,711 --> 02:07:21,711
maybe that shaman had a bad day and 
that's why it's become a slippery 

2737
02:07:21,711 --> 02:07:21,711
shaman.
Well,

2738
02:07:21,711 --> 02:07:22,560
no,
that's a great band.

2739
02:07:22,620 --> 02:07:24,460
Slippery shaman like so,
like,

2740
02:07:24,570 --> 02:07:26,420
so this guy,
the shoot,

2741
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:29,010
like of course we all have individual 
culpability,

2742
02:07:29,011 --> 02:07:33,120
but similarly he is a product of our 
culture is a product of this again,

2743
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:34,610
system.
So like,

2744
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:36,520
you know,
there is one form of analysis

2745
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:41,520
that says a meteorological disasters.
They're detached from reality and of 

2746
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:45,420
course meteorology is its own fucking 
thing and individual freewill near.

2747
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:47,070
There are some newer,
I'm sure you know,

2748
02:07:47,110 --> 02:07:52,110
say that doesn't even fucking exists for
out in nature out in a meteorology.

2749
02:07:52,391 --> 02:07:55,060
The biochemistry of our system is 
governing everything.

2750
02:07:55,330 --> 02:08:00,330
But certainly there are connections 
between each of us that create the way 

2751
02:08:00,330 --> 02:08:01,280
that we behave.
You know,

2752
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:03,640
if like if,
if I haven't experienced in here where I

2753
02:08:03,641 --> 02:08:08,641
walk out feeling intimidated,
maybe I'll be less kind to the people I 

2754
02:08:08,641 --> 02:08:13,021
work with,
a less extreme example of a brutal 

2755
02:08:13,021 --> 02:08:14,410
murders and the more obvious example 
aware of it,

2756
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:19,440
we're aware of it,
which is one of the reasons why 

2757
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:20,290
altruistic behavior kind behavior,
loving community,

2758
02:08:20,291 --> 02:08:22,420
these,
all these things are rewarded because we

2759
02:08:22,421 --> 02:08:26,800
do understand that those do enforce a 
better way of people behaving.

2760
02:08:26,801 --> 02:08:29,670
And that real determinism.
Like people like if you,

2761
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:34,680
if you really truly don't have freewill,
well we know that we would like people 

2762
02:08:35,621 --> 02:08:40,621
to behave kinder because whatever 
factors that play into people going out 

2763
02:08:41,231 --> 02:08:43,180
and behaving in a nicer,
kinder way,

2764
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:46,750
there are part of that that we know that
that's the fuel of that

2765
02:08:46,850 --> 02:08:51,850
so isn't then the role of us as 
individuals finding our own conor 

2766
02:08:51,850 --> 02:08:52,670
mcgregor,
our own greatness,

2767
02:08:52,690 --> 02:08:57,690
out own heroism to create as much as 
possible a spice for the altruism,

2768
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:03,040
a spice for that philanthropy,
a space for that togetherness to create 

2769
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:03,040
those moments,
like you said,

2770
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:05,000
without hurricane web and we've all 
experienced there.

2771
02:09:05,001 --> 02:09:07,220
I know when I do something nice for 
other people,

2772
02:09:07,450 --> 02:09:08,210
I start to feel,
oh,

2773
02:09:08,211 --> 02:09:10,310
this is what I'm meant to be.
This is what I'm meant to be doing.

2774
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:13,160
But I in my own personal life gets 
sidetracked by our fuck.

2775
02:09:13,161 --> 02:09:18,161
I've got these economic imperatives on 
want to fucking feel great about myself 

2776
02:09:18,161 --> 02:09:19,220
because of other people's applause or 
you know,

2777
02:09:19,221 --> 02:09:24,221
verification like it like because we are
all flawed because we are continually 

2778
02:09:24,221 --> 02:09:25,670
going to battle between the monkey in 
us.

2779
02:09:25,710 --> 02:09:28,730
The primary little creature in us.
And the great angel within us,

2780
02:09:29,300 --> 02:09:34,300
what if we have an agreement on a social
level that what we're aiming towards is 

2781
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:35,720
the most benevolent,
the most beautiful,

2782
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:37,810
and on an individual level we try and do
it,

2783
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:42,820
and communally we encourage each other 
towards it knowing that we're going to 

2784
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:44,690
fuck up and fail all the time,
but that we're heading in that direction

2785
02:09:44,691 --> 02:09:49,691
together instead of what we have,
which is a system that is about make as 

2786
02:09:49,691 --> 02:09:50,450
much money as you can and get out.

2787
02:09:50,450 --> 02:09:52,400
You only have 100 years line up the blow
jobs.

2788
02:09:52,580 --> 02:09:57,580
That is the system that we have that is 
capitalist consumers and that's what 

2789
02:09:57,580 --> 02:09:58,310
it's based on.
This is a machine.

2790
02:09:58,370 --> 02:10:03,370
The machine makes money.
It's got to have infinite expanse and 

2791
02:10:03,370 --> 02:10:03,370
infinite growth.
That is,

2792
02:10:03,370 --> 02:10:05,840
that is the system.
I'm not saying that it's very fatalistic

2793
02:10:05,841 --> 02:10:07,350
way.
It look fantastic.

2794
02:10:07,420 --> 02:10:08,660
I think we can change the world

2795
02:10:09,140 --> 02:10:10,190
doing it.
And you're not.

2796
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:13,700
You're not living that way.
So the system that you're talking about,

2797
02:10:13,730 --> 02:10:15,650
it's escapable you've escaped.
Yes.

2798
02:10:15,730 --> 02:10:18,160
And we.
We're talking about it and it's just no,

2799
02:10:18,260 --> 02:10:23,260
there's no like willy wonka golden 
ticket that's going to get you out of 

2800
02:10:23,260 --> 02:10:23,260
the system.

2801
02:10:23,260 --> 02:10:25,180
I don't trust him.
Shady fucking on polymers.

2802
02:10:25,190 --> 02:10:30,190
Where do you get them?
I doN't think I should even be working 

2803
02:10:30,190 --> 02:10:32,330
there.
Too much chocolate loss in that truck 

2804
02:10:32,330 --> 02:10:32,330
though.
That poor boy drowning.

2805
02:10:32,330 --> 02:10:32,750
And there was johnny depp behaving like 
a young girl.

2806
02:10:36,190 --> 02:10:38,990
I've been lucky.
A fucking movie man.

2807
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:41,450
He's a weird way of talking.
A lot of questions.

2808
02:10:41,451 --> 02:10:45,960
I think it was about Michael Jackson,
chocolate chocolates,

2809
02:10:47,310 --> 02:10:51,790
the peter pan type deal that clean.
I don't want to grow up you.

2810
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:55,090
I think you need to go back to it.
There is.

2811
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:58,360
It's chocolate factory.
Johnny.

2812
02:10:58,690 --> 02:11:00,830
Look at my.
And I think,

2813
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:05,840
uh,
this fatalistic thing that it's just 

2814
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:05,840
designed to.
It's.

2815
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:05,900
I don't think it's designed to do 
anything.

2816
02:11:05,901 --> 02:11:07,310
I just think it is,
it just,

2817
02:11:07,430 --> 02:11:10,670
it is an agree with that.
I even agree with that.

2818
02:11:10,671 --> 02:11:15,671
I think.
I think that what we live in is the 

2819
02:11:15,671 --> 02:11:15,671
manifestation of our most primal 
desires.

2820
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:18,620
Greed or not even necessarily great 
survival.

2821
02:11:18,860 --> 02:11:21,200
And I think that if you extrapolate on 
that system,

2822
02:11:21,201 --> 02:11:26,201
you end up with what we've got,
but I think an alternative way of being 

2823
02:11:26,201 --> 02:11:27,710
something that might be a corrective 
path for us is to look at those.

2824
02:11:28,030 --> 02:11:31,160
This feelings that you described of the 
altruism in that hurricane,

2825
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:36,400
the feeling of greatness in an 
individual and the way that an 

2826
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:36,400
individual can pull communities together
is sort of like a.

2827
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:38,870
It's not a binary choice.
I know the world's more complicated than

2828
02:11:38,871 --> 02:11:43,871
that joe.
But like I suppose my quest and indeed 

2829
02:11:43,871 --> 02:11:45,380
fuck me,
my book is about how I individually have

2830
02:11:45,410 --> 02:11:50,410
got my head and I wrenched myself away 
from selfishness and greed and pride on 

2831
02:11:50,410 --> 02:11:54,380
a daily basis and pull myself towards 
our tourism and love and self betterment

2832
02:11:54,410 --> 02:11:56,960
apart of it.
Keep myself fit mentally,

2833
02:11:56,961 --> 02:11:59,600
spiritually.
So I can be a better part of this.

2834
02:12:00,230 --> 02:12:02,570
Excuse me,
system and perhaps through myself,

2835
02:12:02,571 --> 02:12:05,390
improvement create better systems 
because there is all this energy.

2836
02:12:05,391 --> 02:12:10,391
There's all this power.
And I think it's a shame that it gets 

2837
02:12:10,391 --> 02:12:10,650
siphoned in a particular direction.
Well that,

2838
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:14,060
that feeling you express and as you 
express it and express it,

2839
02:12:14,061 --> 02:12:19,061
honestly,
that resonates with people and I think 

2840
02:12:19,061 --> 02:12:20,360
this,
what we're talking about is the 49 point

2841
02:12:20,361 --> 02:12:25,361
nine percent and 50 point one percent 
that rick strassman was describing.

2842
02:12:25,430 --> 02:12:28,220
It was this constant battle and it is 
not an easy path.

2843
02:12:28,280 --> 02:12:30,080
I don't think the system operates it.
The 50,

2844
02:12:30,081 --> 02:12:35,081
49,
therefore I think the system's way way 

2845
02:12:35,081 --> 02:12:37,691
towards the negative system like a 
cultural system and the economic system,

2846
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:42,940
human beings in this world is a 
capitalist country or where they say I 

2847
02:12:43,431 --> 02:12:45,440
don't know enough about what goes down 
in China.

2848
02:12:45,500 --> 02:12:47,870
So I'll say like sort of global 
capitalism.

2849
02:12:47,871 --> 02:12:49,550
Say and again I'm not a fucking 
economist.

2850
02:12:49,551 --> 02:12:52,310
I'm just picking up shit from listening 
to your podcast and have a podcast,

2851
02:12:52,311 --> 02:12:57,311
you know?
I mean that's where I'm getting 

2852
02:12:57,311 --> 02:12:58,121
educated.
I've luckily turned up at university of 

2853
02:12:58,121 --> 02:12:58,121
lately.
I'm tripping on that fucking coffee,

2854
02:12:58,121 --> 02:12:58,121
man.
Man.

2855
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:03,760
Deep.
Can I go to the toilet and maybe the 

2856
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:07,160
poor hell have I been in here?
Do you feel like I've done enough about 

2857
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:08,270
my book?
We've done two hours and 20 minutes.

2858
02:13:08,271 --> 02:13:10,070
We could wrap this fucking got a clock 
there.

2859
02:13:10,071 --> 02:13:15,071
You've got these advantages.
There's buddhas in every direction and 

2860
02:13:15,071 --> 02:13:15,290
only one clock I didn't know at the time
is a clock there.

2861
02:13:15,291 --> 02:13:16,470
There's a clock there.
There's.

2862
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:21,840
They're all facing you.
Facing anybody who was a guest to think 

2863
02:13:21,981 --> 02:13:24,170
about time.
This is a tune one.

2864
02:13:24,490 --> 02:13:27,260
This system.
Yeah.

2865
02:13:27,261 --> 02:13:32,261
I'm just some johnny come lately.
Kid from england with a dream weaver a 

2866
02:13:32,261 --> 02:13:32,261
I'll come

2867
02:13:32,261 --> 02:13:34,650
over here to the layer,
a dream to sell books.

2868
02:13:35,630 --> 02:13:37,890
I'm just a kid.
He wants to fuck the system,

2869
02:13:37,891 --> 02:13:41,600
but by my book out of that,
obviously polk.

2870
02:13:41,620 --> 02:13:42,780
Chrissy,
how dAre you point out.

2871
02:13:42,781 --> 02:13:44,300
That obviously puts it.
Cannot do a wait.

2872
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:46,030
No.
Yeah,

2873
02:13:46,310 --> 02:13:47,540
yeah.
You're bad.

2874
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:53,000
You're good.
Typically we're open that door and the 

2875
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:53,000
first one.
Yeah.

2876
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:53,700
Nah man.
It's beautiful.

2877
02:13:53,701 --> 02:13:55,740
Don't worry about it.
No,

2878
02:13:55,741 --> 02:13:56,250
no,
no.

2879
02:13:56,251 --> 02:13:57,450
You're good man.
Don't worry.

2880
02:13:57,510 --> 02:13:59,840
You're good.
Told you that caveman coffee.

2881
02:13:59,870 --> 02:14:02,930
Who's going to get them?
You were gonna.

2882
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:06,850
Pull something up about nas.
I think I had something I didn't know if

2883
02:14:06,851 --> 02:14:10,010
you knew he was a venture capitalist.
Um,

2884
02:14:10,510 --> 02:14:15,510
I mean like I know you opens up a 
restaurant up that sweet chick place 

2885
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:17,080
potentially if there's companies sell 
soon,

2886
02:14:17,081 --> 02:14:19,390
I don't know how that happens.
Or if it comes public,

2887
02:14:19,540 --> 02:14:22,210
he could be what they're saying is hip 
hop's first true billionaire.

2888
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:25,230
Yeah,
no worries.

2889
02:14:26,170 --> 02:14:27,810
Says it's only like if that slipper 
network,

2890
02:14:27,811 --> 02:14:32,811
there's like $17 million.
That doesn't include all the companies 

2891
02:14:32,811 --> 02:14:34,170
he owns and has been investing in for a 
long time.

2892
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:35,400
No,
I didn't know about that.

2893
02:14:35,450 --> 02:14:35,850
I knew

2894
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:41,160
about his restaurant because I'm friends
with everlast and everlast goes to that 

2895
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:45,271
sweet chick.
I think everlast was a piece of that 

2896
02:14:45,271 --> 02:14:45,271
too.
I don't know,

2897
02:14:45,271 --> 02:14:47,581
maybe he doesn't,
but he took me to it in New York and 

2898
02:14:47,581 --> 02:14:51,030
took me to an la once we went there.
But if they were playing music that was 

2899
02:14:51,030 --> 02:14:51,340
so loud,
it was literally hurting my ears.

2900
02:14:51,790 --> 02:14:56,790
Nas is like half man,
half venture capitalists look at that 

2901
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:57,010
beautiful suit.
He's gone on.

2902
02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:00,940
He's got a pocket square and like a 
little small chain.

2903
02:15:01,210 --> 02:15:02,620
Have you ever seen the small chain?

2904
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:05,050
I don't know now with the.
I don't know.

2905
02:15:05,390 --> 02:15:06,950
Interesting.
Yeah,

2906
02:15:06,951 --> 02:15:08,990
there's a lot of those motherfuckers 
make a shit ton of money.

2907
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:10,460
Smart.
Why not?

2908
02:15:10,520 --> 02:15:15,520
You know,
I mean it shows you that they could 

2909
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:19,390
figure out a way through just their art 
to get to this weird position where I 

2910
02:15:20,121 --> 02:15:22,790
mean if not really does make a Billion 
dollars.

2911
02:15:22,791 --> 02:15:26,330
Like fuck still makes amazing music 
though.

2912
02:15:26,570 --> 02:15:31,570
That's my point.
My point is that his music never went 

2913
02:15:31,570 --> 02:15:31,570
commercial smoothies.
It's fucking fantastic.

2914
02:15:31,570 --> 02:15:34,930
Someone was saying I was reading some 
stuff that he supposedly tried.

2915
02:15:34,931 --> 02:15:39,931
Remember he had a rap battle up beef had
a couple of beats jz with like puff 

2916
02:15:39,931 --> 02:15:42,520
daddy the hate me now thing.
Oh that he like,

2917
02:15:42,521 --> 02:15:44,650
he also wrote,
ghost wrote for wilson myth.

2918
02:15:44,651 --> 02:15:46,330
I don't know what that really means.
He's sold out,

2919
02:15:46,331 --> 02:15:49,090
but that's not selling out.
That's just writing for a friend.

2920
02:15:49,330 --> 02:15:51,580
But the rap battles I think is more just
an ego thing.

2921
02:15:51,581 --> 02:15:53,800
Someone talk shit about him.
He talks shit about them.

2922
02:15:53,801 --> 02:15:54,540
Yeah,
you know,

2923
02:15:54,580 --> 02:15:56,920
you all right brother.
You got a copy of your book.

2924
02:15:57,160 --> 02:15:59,020
You're not fucking around.
You brought a copy back.

2925
02:15:59,021 --> 02:16:00,850
Now if you want to show everybody here,
give it to me.

2926
02:16:00,851 --> 02:16:05,230
I'll hold it up so you don't feel bad.
Vanna white.

2927
02:16:07,570 --> 02:16:12,570
I like joe rogan.
I'm wanting to experience freedom from 

2928
02:16:12,570 --> 02:16:12,870
our addictions,
russell brand.

2929
02:16:12,871 --> 02:16:15,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's wrap this thing up man.

2930
02:16:15,301 --> 02:16:17,130
We've talked for two hours and 20 
minutes.

2931
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:18,660
That's good.
Beautiful.

2932
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:21,420
You kicked it,
kicked it into the fucking orbit.

2933
02:16:21,510 --> 02:16:26,510
I didn't change the bit that I wrote 
about you as a matter of fact because I 

2934
02:16:26,510 --> 02:16:27,510
didn't know you wrote about me in there.
Yeah,

2935
02:16:27,700 --> 02:16:29,240
yeah.
Now you fucking interested.

2936
02:16:29,280 --> 02:16:30,130
Oh man.
I'm feeling

2937
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:35,130
good.
It was slightly because what it was I 

2938
02:16:35,130 --> 02:16:38,941
realized I asked them to put in the word
seemingly because I thought that I'd 

2939
02:16:38,941 --> 02:16:42,000
been to reductive and you know me like 
I'm having this experience like is part 

2940
02:16:45,671 --> 02:16:50,671
of the book is about trying to explain 
how in the addict's mind you're trapped 

2941
02:16:50,671 --> 02:16:54,031
in this constant cycle,
own self obsessive for an outside world 

2942
02:16:54,031 --> 02:16:55,600
seems so massIve distance and you can't 
connect to it.

2943
02:16:55,601 --> 02:17:00,601
Right?
So as well as explain Now to go through 

2944
02:17:00,601 --> 02:17:02,611
the steps.
I talk through like this is what it's 

2945
02:17:02,611 --> 02:17:02,611
like to be in mY fucking head.
So I'm like,

2946
02:17:02,611 --> 02:17:03,670
this is me out with my dog,
I'm a dog,

2947
02:17:03,671 --> 02:17:07,780
causes all these problems all the time,
and I run into these people and say,

2948
02:17:07,781 --> 02:17:09,880
all I know,
I've run into them and I start,

2949
02:17:09,881 --> 02:17:12,250
I don't want to go and talk to them 
because I feel so self conscious because

2950
02:17:12,251 --> 02:17:13,530
I've looked kind of like cool.

2951
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:14,170
And I think,
oh no,

2952
02:17:14,171 --> 02:17:16,420
I've got these people.
I'm going to feel inadequate.

2953
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:19,930
All I know is how I feel and that's all 
I'll ever know unless I learn.

2954
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:24,520
I can learn a new system for being bill.
This guy comes over and says hello while

2955
02:17:24,521 --> 02:17:26,200
I stand now on the goose.
Shit,

2956
02:17:26,260 --> 02:17:29,890
we're on this sort of riverbank.
Vaguely embarrassed by bear.

2957
02:17:29,891 --> 02:17:34,090
My dog bears looping enthusiasm.
I heard you on joe rogan.

2958
02:17:34,091 --> 02:17:35,380
He says,
joe rogan,

2959
02:17:35,381 --> 02:17:40,381
the former mixed martial artist 
commentate a comedian and host of the 

2960
02:17:40,381 --> 02:17:44,341
world's most downloaded podcast is 
himself an interesting example of new 

2961
02:17:44,341 --> 02:17:46,870
emerging models of masculinity,
a fusion of right wing individualism,

2962
02:17:46,871 --> 02:17:49,180
a new age tolerance,
a fierce auto didact.

2963
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:52,900
he has become a champion of american 
libertarianism is to me,

2964
02:17:52,901 --> 02:17:55,780
fascinating because he's clever and a 
good fighter.

2965
02:17:56,260 --> 02:18:01,260
There you go.
There's me mentioning you in passing 

2966
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:01,260
now.
I went over whenever he wrote here.

2967
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:04,590
I said,
you better put in seemingly because I 

2968
02:18:04,590 --> 02:18:05,140
think a footnote in reductive.
They're saying miksang,

2969
02:18:05,141 --> 02:18:08,140
right wing individualism and newark,
but what do you think about that,

2970
02:18:08,141 --> 02:18:09,100
joe?
They are.

2971
02:18:10,300 --> 02:18:13,180
I don't know how much right wing I have 
in me.

2972
02:18:13,220 --> 02:18:18,220
I'm exactly libertarian libertarian 
right wing stuff is probably,

2973
02:18:18,251 --> 02:18:20,050
if you talk to a real bright winger,
they'd go,

2974
02:18:20,051 --> 02:18:21,670
what the fuck you're talking about?
Yeah,

2975
02:18:21,671 --> 02:18:22,510
I think you're right.
I mean,

2976
02:18:22,511 --> 02:18:25,510
I think a lot of libertarianism would 
have sort of covered it better,

2977
02:18:25,511 --> 02:18:27,340
but this was written a point where I 
didn't.

2978
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:32,350
I hadn't listened to as much stuff,
so I've changed in this amount.

2979
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:34,840
You can come on here anytime you Want.
I love talking to you.

2980
02:18:34,990 --> 02:18:36,250
You're awesome.
Do you think so?

2981
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:37,880
We have a great time.
We did have a great time there.

2982
02:18:37,890 --> 02:18:42,890
We.
I'm looking forward to going back to

your new studio.
That sounds like your own version of a 

2984
02:18:43,981 --> 02:18:43,981
willy wonka podcast.
Land be crazy.

2985
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:46,210
The thing is,
you know,

2986
02:18:46,211 --> 02:18:51,211
like this is why I don't take drugs is 
because I've drank caffeine there and 

2987
02:18:51,211 --> 02:18:54,511
I'm sort of slightly scared of going 
back to like my normal life in a 

2988
02:18:54,970 --> 02:18:59,970
parachute in,
back into that fucking brand.

2989
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:02,500
