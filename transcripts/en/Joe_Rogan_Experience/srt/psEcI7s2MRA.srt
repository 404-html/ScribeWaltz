00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello Freak bitches.
Why do these patterns repeat themselves?

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,500
What is it about human beings?
Well,

3
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:11,500
we like things simple.
We like things simple.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,860
So C and then you often like a simple
explanation is a good explanation unless

5
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:19,930
it's too simple.
But distinguishing between simple and

6
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:22,540
too simple is no easy matter.
We like,

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,280
we like to know who's our friend and
who's our enemy and we like the feeling

8
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:30,530
of under and moral superiority and then
learned morals,

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,600
which had,
especially when there is no such thing

10
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,150
as earning anyways.
So,

11
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:39,250
and then,
I mean there's deeper and darker things

12
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:42,760
that are underneath that.
It's like the human proclivity to pull

13
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:46,660
down those who have more than you.
It's like these kids on the campuses who

14
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:49,150
are claiming identity with the
oppressed,

15
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:50,800
you know,
somewhere like Yale.

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,780
It's like how in the world you can speak
of oppression if you happened to be at

17
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:57,250
Yale is beyond me.

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,420
I mean,
first of all,

19
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:02,140
your North American,
which puts you in the top 1% and then of

20
00:01:02,141 --> 00:01:05,650
North Americans,
you're in the top 1% two in the top 1%

21
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:08,740
of 1% but yet you,
you want that,

22
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:12,550
you want to have all the power that goes
along with that and you want to have the

23
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:16,000
moral superiority that comes from being
a,

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,340
uh,
representative of the oppressed.

25
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:21,520
So that's exactly what you want.
You want all the power and you want all

26
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:23,760
the victimization at the same time.
Well,

27
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:26,340
years.
Yale is a great example because Yale was

28
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:30,750
one of the,
what happened with the Halloween costume

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,670
debacle had gail was one of the first
videos that was released that made

30
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:39,840
people horrified where they couldn't
believe how students were communicating

31
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:41,280
with professors.
Yeah.

32
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:43,830
Well do a student who,
who screamed up a storm about,

33
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,210
about that.
Uh,

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,440
the male professor who was the husband
of the woman who wrote the Pro Halloween

35
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,660
costume letter,
it turned out she was on the bloody

36
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:53,400
hiring committee that hired him.

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,950
One of the things she screamed was,
who hired you?

38
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:56,790
It was like,
well,

39
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:00,330
it turned out it was you because you
were on the committee just a few years

40
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:00,961
before.
I know.

41
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:02,670
And they took it like,
yeah,

42
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:05,500
that was absolutely in the people.
Well that don't know what the hell we're

43
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,680
talking about.
Well explained this debacle because it

44
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,670
really was about questionable Halloween
costumes.

45
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,000
Well,
it was about questioning Halloween

46
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,090
costumes.
Halloween costumes are

47
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,980
part of the whole point of Halloween is
to have questionable costumes,

48
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,840
right?
You play with death for example,

49
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:28,200
in decay and and horror and,
and it's,

50
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:33,201
it's a time when the norms with regards
to the expression of things that are

51
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:38,541
outside of our normal behavior are
suspended so that everybody can can have

52
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:40,590
a little celebration.
As it turns out.

53
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:41,401
Well,
you know,

54
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:45,600
campuses have got all upset about things
like cultural appropriation at Queen's

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,110
University in Canada just the other week
they were going after students who were

56
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,810
dressing up as Viet Cong for example,
or Mexicans.

57
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,240
It's like,
I just don't see what the hell's racist

58
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:58,710
about dressing up like a Mexican.
Mexicans have a traditional traditional

59
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,680
clothing.
What?

60
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,180
There's nothing wrong with Mexicans.
So why is it wrong to dress up like

61
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,890
them?
And if you want to be Puncho via for

62
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:07,240
Halloween,
what's wrong with that?

63
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,480
A wall will get what you can.
You can regard that as an Omar's just as

64
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,420
much as a denigration.
It's like why is that such a problem?

65
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,590
Right.
But anyways,

66
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:17,740
it doesn't matter because nothing's too
trivial to be a problem to a social

67
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:20,350
justice warrior.
And because they don't like to deal with

68
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:24,160
real problems.
And Yale went after Halloween costs.

69
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:29,170
So this woman wrote a letter saying,
maybe we should just relax about this

70
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,800
stuff.
And you know,

71
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,090
not don't put restrictions on what
people wear for Halloween,

72
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:37,000
but let people decide what is and isn't
offensive.

73
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,081
Yes.
And well,

74
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,930
in many Halloween costumes are
offensive.

75
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,060
That's the point.
But her letter was in really reasons.

76
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,780
It was perfectly reasonable.
It was like an,

77
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,670
it was like an adult wrote it.
Yes.

78
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,330
Yeah.
And,

79
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,070
and you know,
all hell broke loose,

80
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,390
all hell.
And she ended up,

81
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,090
she ended up quitting.
And I think he did it.

82
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,871
No,
I don't think,

83
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:57,700
I don't think he left.
I don't think he left,

84
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:01,340
but she did.
Seeing him bow down to this woman's

85
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,620
screaming at him,
swearing in his face was so disturbing.

86
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,150
It was so humiliating.
I felt so humiliated for him cause she

87
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:12,160
was screaming,
this is our home.

88
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:15,670
What the fuck are you doing?
You're not making a safe home.

89
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,640
The university's not a home.
It's not a safe space.

90
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,820
It's not a secure space.
None of that.

91
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,451
And,
and if,

92
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:27,451
if it that when they get
a university isn't a home,

93
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,080
that's not what it is.

94
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,460
It's a place to be confronted by,
I would say often horrible ideas.

95
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,250
You want to learn about history,
you think that's going to be safe.

96
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:39,970
Do you know what human history is like?
It's an endless blood bath with,

97
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,690
you know,
with,

98
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,320
with a certain amount of a hopeful
progress underlying it.

99
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:44,801
It's,
it's a,

100
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:47,500
it's a,
it's a horror show and great literature

101
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:48,370
is like that.
And,

102
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,670
and,
and biology is terrifying and physics is

103
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:55,090
terrifying and you want to be safe.
It's stay home.

104
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,640
Stay home with your mom,
stay home with your dad.

105
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,860
Don't come to university if you want to
be safe,

106
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,200
because anything you do outside,
no one of the,

107
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,520
if you,
if you're going,

108
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,900
if the university is going to make you
safe than it ceased to be a university.

109
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,360
So one of the things I tried to do in my
class,

110
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:12,040
I have this class called maps of
meaning,

111
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:16,500
which concentrates on atrocity basically
on Soviet atrocity and,

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,700
and Nazi atrocity mostly.

113
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,230
And what I tried to do in the class is
to teach my students that had they been

114
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:27,310
in Nazi Germany in the 1930s,
they would've been Nazis and had they

115
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,920
been offered the opportunity to be in
Auschwitz,

116
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,270
Auschwitz,
camp guard,

117
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,090
then maybe they would have leapt at it
and maybe they would have been in the

118
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,290
sadistic,
uh,

119
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,490
in the more sadistic proportion of the
Auschwitz camp guard population.

120
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,690
You think that makes you feel safe.
It doesn't make you feel safe to know

121
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:46,360
that Nazis were humans and you happen to
be one of them.

122
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,010
And so I think that educators that tell
students that they're offering them a

123
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:54,010
safe space are doing them a profound
disservice.

124
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:57,190
And you don't,
I'm a clinical psychologist.

125
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,410
Here's one of the things you do to make
people less afraid.

126
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,370
You don't make the world safer.
What you do is you people tell you what

127
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:10,520
they're afraid of and then you break it
into little bits so that they can go

128
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:11,354
confront them.

129
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,100
You know?
So maybe they were afraid of going to a

130
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:15,050
party and you break that down and you
say,

131
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:16,550
well,
do you know how to introduce yourself?

132
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:16,941
And he said,
well,

133
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:18,260
I don't,
I don't really even know how to shake

134
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,750
someone's hand.
And so then you practice having them

135
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:23,330
shake their hand and introduce
themselves because maybe they weren't

136
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:26,000
taught by that by their halfway did
parents when they were,

137
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,310
when they were young,
because they were ignored.

138
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,571
And so then you say,
well,

139
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:32,390
maybe you can go to a party for half an
hour and all you have to do is introduce

140
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,820
yourself to two people and then we'll
call that success.

141
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,810
And you build up their competence and
their confidence one step at a time.

142
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,040
And what happens to the clinical
literature indicates quite clearly is

143
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,200
you don't make people less anxious.
By doing that.

144
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,880
You make them braver.

145
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:52,280
It's not the same thing.
You don't make the world and its horrors

146
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,180
smaller.
You make the person and their their

147
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,700
their capacity to deal with horror
larger.

148
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,280
You encourage them,
you strengthen them.

149
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,850
That's what you do at a university.
You arm people with arguments,

150
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:06,380
you,
you hone their intellect,

151
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:08,480
you,
you help them learn to write so they can

152
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,610
marshal their arguments.
You,

153
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,760
you'll help them learn how to engage in
intellectual combat because that's

154
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,760
better than engaging in real combat.
And you make them,

155
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,560
you make them hard and strong.
You don't mollycoddle them and make them

156
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:25,190
safe unless you're their enemy,
unless you're trying to devour their

157
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:28,040
spirit.
And that's what we have in the

158
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,120
universities.
We have,

159
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,030
we have the reign of the depaul mother
who's,

160
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:35,000
who's answered everything is all just
come a little closer deer and all

161
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:38,000
protect you from the world.
It's just like Hansel and Gretel,

162
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,291
the,
you know,

163
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:39,980
the,
the,

164
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,900
the which in the Hansel and Gretel
story.

165
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,020
Well my house is made of gingerbread.
Just come in here and everything will be

166
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:48,080
fine while she feeds you candy to fatten
you up so she can eat you.

167
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,780
That's the archetype of a modern
university.

168
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,440
[inaudible].
