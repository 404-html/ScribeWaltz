1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,940
So when you were partying,

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,043
what was your thing?

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,090
Does doing cocaine by myself at the house.

4
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:09,510
Really?

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,190
Cocaine.

6
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:10,340
Yeah.

7
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,190
It was all cocaine.

8
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,093
Yeah.

9
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,110
Dude in cocaine.

10
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:14,700
Oh go back to their vest or a man.

11
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:15,660
So here's what happened.

12
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,280
So I would get fucked up and put these
vests on and put on sunglasses and not

13
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:21,990
let them know like Buffalo Bill Shit,

14
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:23,370
but at least party and by myself,

15
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,223
you know,

16
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,270
and I was making like a nice smoothie
and I'm fucking coked up on partying,

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,670
you know,

18
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,351
live in home.

19
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:31,530
The hawkers to vests on maybe.

20
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,010
Right.

21
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:32,843
And I thought,

22
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,680
I thought I heard something outside.

23
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:34,921
Right.

24
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:38,310
Which is kind of weird to even think
of when you have a blender going,

25
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:38,850
right?

26
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,130
So I leave out of my apartment
to go in the hallway,

27
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,510
lock myself out with the blender,

28
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,590
going to be 30 in the morning,

29
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,800
coked up out of my brain and I have to
go to my landlord dude who lives right

30
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,600
down the hall and tell him like,

31
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:55,434
hey man,

32
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,450
I got logged out.

33
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,333
I'm like,

34
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,301
oh my God,

35
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:01,260
he must have hated you.

36
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:01,800
Oh,

37
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,380
the blender shorts out and smoke happens.

38
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,440
The fire alarm starts
going off in the building,

39
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,560
right as I'm ad is door
knocking right now.

40
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:11,610
He's pissed and he's like,

41
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:12,630
what's going on?

42
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,190
And I didn't know what to say.

43
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:17,820
I told him that I was throwing
a late Christmas party.

44
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:18,654
Dude,

45
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,540
it was fucking into January.

46
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,830
I will with you at the time,

47
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:23,520
Huh?

48
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:23,701
Oh,

49
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:27,060
this is two and a half years ago was 35

50
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,780
so he comes back to my apartment,

51
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:31,050
right?

52
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:31,883
He's,

53
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,420
he unlocks the door.

54
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,460
There's nobody in there.

55
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,400
Oh my God.

56
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:41,970
I'm like,

57
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,391
man.

58
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:43,224
But that's it.

59
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,243
It was fun.

60
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,480
How long did you live there for?

61
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,053
I still live there.

62
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,600
Whoa.

63
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,433
We've passion.

64
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:51,060
You know,

65
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,500
like I've caught him doing some things.

66
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,600
I think we're all even.
