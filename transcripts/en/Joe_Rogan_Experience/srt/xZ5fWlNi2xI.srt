00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,380
Hello my friends.
Hello people out there in cyber land.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,620
Hello.
Human beings listening to one's and 

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,530
zero's transmitted through computers.
Allegedly,

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,820
I don't even know how this works.
Uh,

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,160
this episode podcast is brought to you 
by Ting Tang is a mobile service company

6
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:22,860
that is an independent company that uses
sprint.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,920
What they do is they rent time on sprint
so you get the same service that you 

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,401
would get with sprint,
but they have it set up their way and 

9
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:34,401
their way is they want to do things is 
evenly and ethically and just as they 

10
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,540
want.
They want to make it as like above board

11
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,610
as possible.
A lot of the things you pay for when you

12
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:46,611
pay for cell phones are not necessary,
especially when you have contracts and 

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,370
early termination fees and if you want 
to get out of things,

14
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:55,371
it's very difficult.
That's one of the things that ting is 

15
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:55,371
avoided.

16
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:56,580
They don't have any contracts cancel 
anytime you want.

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,740
They don't have any early termination 
fees.

18
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,930
They think it's silly and they also have
it set up in a very brilliant way where 

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,990
you only pay for what you use.
So instead of having 120 minutes a month

20
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:08,010
or whatever it is,
a month,

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,090
whatever,
whatever your,

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,830
you know,
your pay thing is,

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,560
if you use less than that,
you don't know.

24
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,890
It's not like the company calls you up 
and says,

25
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:17,520
Hey,
you know,

26
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:22,521
you should probably have a service for 
less minutes because you don't use all 

27
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:26,781
your minutes and then you know,
you have all these minutes that you 

28
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:26,781
didn't use,
but you did pay for the waiting,

29
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:31,450
has it,
you pay for what you use and you would 

30
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,370
be shocked at how easy it is to save 
money.

31
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,760
Ninety eight percent of people would 
save money using ting.

32
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,900
Um,
I don't know about the coverage but I 

33
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:40,900
know because,
uh,

34
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,810
you know,
I feel like at this point in time,

35
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,220
Sprint like Joey Diaz love sprint.
He's had sprint for like 10 years.

36
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,540
Don't text him on it though.
We can't text him.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,080
He won't accept phone messages.
You won't accept text messages if you 

38
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,920
call him.
He wants to see matt full trunk called,

39
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,040
you know,
Mr.

40
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,150
Ms Dot Call Matt Full Toronto voicemail.
No voicemail.

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,840
But this is the,
this is not like some Hick cell phone 

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,090
company.
This is the sprint backbone,

43
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:09,660
so it's one of the best cell phone 
providers in the country.

44
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,570
So you get the exact same service,
but you own your phone,

45
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,330
they'll sell you an iphone,
five or 260 bucks,

46
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:20,331
they sell you all the best android 
phones and you actually pay for the 

47
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:24,081
phone instead of what's going on.
When you go to a lot of places like the 

48
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:24,930
bigger name places and you'd get a 
phone,

49
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,310
it's 500 bucks.

50
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,520
It's not really 500 bucks.
It's probably more,

51
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,540
but you have to pay over the course of 
several years that you have your 

52
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,750
contract.
You pay with the differences.

53
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,850
So if you're paying a dollar $199,
but the phone is actually $600 phone.

54
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,060
You owe them $401 that you'll have to 
pay for over the course of your 

55
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,781
contract.
That's one of the reasons why when you 

56
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:52,521
try to leave your contract,
you have to pay money to get out of it 

57
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:53,640
and this is all something you've signed 
and you might not even realize it.

58
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,940
That's how it was for the longest time 
contracts and early termination fees and

59
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,440
paying for x amount of minutes per month
and Tim has just stepped in and stopped 

60
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,971
all that nonsense and I think it's going
to be the model that all cell phone 

61
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:09,700
companies using in the future,
but right now things using it,

62
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:12,730
they have that new nexus five which is 
fucking bad ass.

63
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,560
They have some bad ass google phones 
now.

64
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,180
Three hundred 49 bucks.
You own it.

65
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,790
It never have to.
There's no payments.

66
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,850
There's no,
you know,

67
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,850
sits over conversations done.
And if you want to leave,

68
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:23,490
you're like,
fuck you,

69
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,490
I got what I want it right over the,
what is it?

70
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,470
P Metro pcs hop over them.
Hop over the 18 t who cares?

71
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,850
They don't,
they don't mind.

72
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,370
But uh,
use the code word Rogan.

73
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,710

76
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,510
That's Rogan.ting.com.
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]

77
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:57,061
dot com.
That is o n n I t a human optimization 

78
00:03:57,061 --> 00:04:01,051
website.
If you look into getting shaped dirty 

79
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:01,051
bitches,
if you're looking to get it in gear,

80
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:02,530
started,
look sexy for the summer pickups,

81
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,300
kettle bells and battle ropes,
and pick up one of those Keith Weber,

82
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,000
Kettle Bell Cardio Dvds.

83
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,060
Oh my goodness.
Extreme kettlebell cardio dvds one and 

84
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,970
two.
They're fucking fantastic.

85
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,300
I love these videos because you just do 
what he does and you're guaranteed to 

86
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,810
want to have a heart attack.
Just keep up.

87
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,520
Just keep up.
That's all you have to do.

88
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,100
And you see him doing it.
So you just try to do it with them.

89
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,250
It's fucking.
It's.

90
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,900
It's even better than going to a gym.
A lot of times when you go to a gym,

91
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,090
how often does the guy lift weights with
you?

92
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,900
You know,
not,

93
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:39,901
not very often,
but when you're following one of those 

94
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:39,901
dvds,
you literally have to follow him.

95
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:41,080
He's doing it.
You got to do it too.

96
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,970
Don't be a bitch,
can't slack off.

97
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,060
Awesome workout and really good for the 
body to.

98
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:51,061
It's a full body exercise type deal with
Kettlebells,

99
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,310
and if you haven't used kettlebells,
the number one urge that I have every 

100
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,091
time I do this commercial is please go 
to either a personal trainer or get a 

101
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:05,251
really light kettlebell and go to 
youtube and learn how to lift weights 

102
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:05,251
and don't get crazy.

103
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:09,840
Don't hurt yourself.
Try start off slow and if you're 

104
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,190
embarrassed by the fact that you're 
lifting weights and it's only 18 pounds,

105
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,780
just don't tell anybody.
Keep working out,

106
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,600
but don't tell anybody on youtube.
Don't put it on Youtube.

107
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,770
Yeah,
put.

108
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,000
Put an outfit on like a furry,
like put like a crazy furry hat and plus

109
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,400
you'll be really shattered with 
kettlebells in the beginning anyway,

110
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,350
so you'll probably hit yourself in the 
head a few times.

111
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:27,930
If you have one of those big furry 
masks,

112
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,950
it'll probably protect you a little bit.
Like if you have some Eric Cleans and 

113
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,420
they hit you and your little chipmunk 
face.

114
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:35,890
Yeah,
it's definitely a private,

115
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,140
private beginning.
Anyway.

116
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,380
Go to [inaudible] dot co and use the 
Codeword Rogan and you could save 10 

117
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,650
percent off any and all supplements.
Without further ado,

118
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:46,420
the full charges here,
Joe and Matt,

119
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:47,940
full truck.
He Music Brian,

120
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,950
the Joe Rogan experience.

121
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,710
Joel Robuchon podcasts all day.

122
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Was he drinking or any urine as fuck?
I just got off the road and I've 

123
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,140
developed a habit.
Ah,

124
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,170
it's kind of my first day off.
So this is the time.

125
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,230
This is the first day off of how many 
days on the road I was gone since June 

126
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,260
11th.
We're going to call that three weeks and

127
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:24,261
I was in the Midwest the whole time.
I never came home and it's nice to see 

128
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:29,230
beautiful Los Angeles,
California doesn't make you appreciate 

129
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,020
the fuck out of me.
We got it.

130
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:35,021
So good out here.
People forget they're not 80 million 

131
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:35,990
people out here because it sucks.
No,

132
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,560
it's because it's off the fucking hook.
It's really unrealistic though.

133
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,500
It's very unrealistic way to live.
We don't ever deal with weather.

134
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,940
I know.
That's what's so funny.

135
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:48,941
Oh,
that's all anybody was talking about 

136
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:48,941
their open brains today.
Sure.

137
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:48,941
Do need some rain.

138
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,620
We never say that even though we're the 
ones that need to remain.

139
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,620
Yeah.
We don't know.

140
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,740
Farms.
Yeah.

141
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,250
We're all farming.
Right.

142
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,960
When people out there say hope it needs 
the rain,

143
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,780
you know they're talking to literally 
talking about farm.

144
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,050
Yeah,
and their livelihood.

145
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,640
I saw a website out there called the 
farmer's only.com,

146
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,270
which is like a dating site,
like an exclusive dating sod farmer 

147
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,090
dudes him up on hog farmer Gal.
Commercial farmers will do a gay 

148
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,800
farmer.com.
Can you have a.

149
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,950
are you allowed to say you're gay?
Can be a farmer and pick up other gay 

150
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,170
farmers.
How many gay farmers are there?

151
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,260
That's a good question.
There's got to be at least 11 gay 

152
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,260
farmers.

153
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,010
Only 11 though.
At least.

154
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,760
That's a worn out dating pool.
Yeah.

155
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,140
Imagine those poor 11 dudes just bang 
into each other.

156
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,830
Jay Barnes and shit.
Tired from working all day.

157
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,930
I can't even put it in.
Go to [inaudible] dot com right now and 

158
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:42,930
you know,
it's hilarious.

159
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,820
My fucking history comes up.
It switches to his first huge cock.com

160
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:49,220
and it's just guys.
That's all good.

161
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,690
Brian.
No hoes allowed.

162
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,510
I'm not doing that.
It will ruin your computer.

163
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,900
Is a weird,
very specific dating site though.

164
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,200
It's the most murder.com
specific I've ever heard.

165
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,320
I guess maybe they feel like a lot of 
people wouldn't understand that 

166
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,320
lifestyle,
you know,

167
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,640
hard work,
man.

168
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,310
Data,
non farmer.

169
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,000
Well here's what you can't do.
You can't be a farmer.

170
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,690
Find a guy or gal that's not a farmer 
from the city.

171
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,820
Drag him out to the farm and expect it 
to work out.

172
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,280
That's not going to work out at all.
It might work out.

173
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,400
It could,
but there's also that thing of a where 

174
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:24,400
you're like,
yeah,

175
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:24,410
I'm a farmer,
and then the chicks like,

176
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:25,860
yeah,
that's cool because I like to.

177
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,980
I got some plants and stuff and you're 
like not the same thing.

178
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,460
They don't know what kind of work hours 
you're going to have to put in,

179
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,750
but they might,
you know,

180
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:37,810
some,
some people will have good work ethics 

181
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:37,810
and they look forward to that sort of a 
challenge.

182
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,370
It might work with the odd person put.
A lot of people have like regular jobs 

183
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,781
where they get to sit down all day.
You imagine if you went from some sort 

184
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:51,191
of an insurance sale.
I always go with insurance salesman 

185
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:51,290
because it seems like one of the most 
fucking boring bullshit jobs.

186
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,350
Phone and email all day,
and you're constantly like ass kissing 

187
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:56,350
til I tell

188
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:56,350
them,
well,

189
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,341
you know,
this sort of the reason why this 

190
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:01,341
coverage is important.
Well,

191
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:01,341
Joe,
normally I wouldn't say this,

192
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,090
but I think in your circumstance.
Oh,

193
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,220
shall we say in your first name over and
over again,

194
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,500
know you're going to love this cover.
Just the best thing you can get,

195
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:09,820
Joe.
Just rubbing you stroking,

196
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,230
get out of there.
They're exhausted.

197
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,610
You know that shit wears on you.
My uncle's car insurance guy and he,

198
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,060
he brings it home with them.
He's adopted the voice.

199
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,410
Oh,
like if I call him up,

200
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:22,830
he's like,
well,

201
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,600
Hello Matthew.
How are you doing today?

202
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,700
I love him.
I love him.

203
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,280
He's great.
Oh ew.

204
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:34,281
Gross.
But he's from New Jersey and now he 

205
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:36,441
lives in northern California.
Now he talks like a regular insurance 

206
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:36,441
guy.
Wow,

207
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:37,650
that's hilarious.
What's up dude?

208
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:38,770
I love you.
I'm not making fun,

209
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,530
man.
Love people.

210
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,660
Always get mad if you talk about them on
a podcast,

211
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:47,661
but even if you say good,
if you say anything funny about some 

212
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:47,670
funny shit that happened,
people get so upset.

213
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,380
Yeah.
Listen man,

214
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:54,381
we're all retarded.
Don't you listen to things we say about 

215
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:54,381
us.
We're all retarded.

216
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:57,480
I've said worse things about myself than
anyone else.

217
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:02,481
The thing that the difference between 
been an insurance salesman and being a 

218
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:04,881
farmer though,
so I think the farmers are a little bit 

219
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:06,510
more happy with what they think.
It feels like you get something done.

220
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,230
Like at the end of the day when you 
brought in the crops,

221
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,380
when you fed the cow,
I don't even know which order you do 

222
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:15,380
that in.
I have no idea.

223
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,650
You know,
whatever you did to bring in food.

224
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah.
No,

225
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,850
you can see it with your eyeballs over 
the course of a couple months.

226
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,020
You can see the crops growing.

227
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,230
They say construction workers are really
happy because they actually get to see 

228
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,080
what they bill.
They're also usually on drugs.

229
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,730
That helps.
That helps,

230
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,560
but yeah,
you're totally right.

231
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,240
I think building things,
getting things like set up a farm,

232
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:37,620
plant the seeds,
water,

233
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:38,150
um,
you know,

234
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,040
watch it.
You're,

235
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,120
you're essentially be facilitating this 
whole construction process and if you 

236
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,020
work in an office and just kind of 
resets every day,

237
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,730
even as a comedian,
it's like,

238
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,320
all right,
I'm going to go do another show.

239
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,770
I'm going to go do another show.
But there isn't that on you because you 

240
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:54,770
just change your act.
You could have,

241
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,120
I mean essentially think about how long 
it takes you to write an act.

242
00:10:57,121 --> 00:11:02,121
If we were smart,
we would do is we would write to acts 

243
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:05,720
two acts and we'd do one on Friday night
and one on Saturday night or one Friday 

244
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,530
early show the other one Friday,
late show.

245
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,580
You're absolutely right.
That way you would never feel anything 

246
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,311
stale.
It's just a matter of you putting it a 

247
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:16,311
little bit more time.
I'm going to do that this week.

248
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:20,280
Do it bitch knew 45 Saturday when I 
record my next special.

249
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:21,870
I'm trying to figure out how I'm going 
to do that.

250
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,920
I'm going to do the next hour,
but I don't,

251
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,470
I don't have anything that I'm like,
that's like leftover stuff.

252
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't think there's a couple of bits 
with them.

253
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,440
I'm never gonna make it anyway.
Yeah.

254
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,930
You know,
so everything that's going to go on this

255
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:38,931
next one.
I'm going to just abandon ship after 

256
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:38,931
it's over.
Then I'm going to be fucked.

257
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,260
Yeah.
You gotta start from scratch.

258
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:43,880
Matter of fired with no weapons.
People paid to see of noma.

259
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,150
Materials.
Dog Shit for a couple of months to do 

260
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,150
some freebies.
But I start doing my.

261
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:54,330
I got plants.
I know a couple of different to take 

262
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:54,330
place.

263
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,600
All of them.
Interdimensional

264
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,660
my move.
I'm actually think I'm going to.

265
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,670
The next one I'm going to do is before 
the filming.

266
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,270
Do one of those in the August.
See The elves,

267
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,440
right?
What's up?

268
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,940
Sit down.
Sit Down with the dark and the light.

269
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:15,150
See if we can work this shit out.
I think you can tested territory.

270
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,260
So,
uh,

271
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,280
tonight the full charge.

272
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,060
I will be at the [inaudible] cafe.
It's a new.

273
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:22,740
A New Haha.
Apparently.

274
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,390
Yeah.
New Hollywood.

275
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,820
Good spot to fuck around.
Yes.

276
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:28,410
We got a lot of good spots to fuck 
around too.

277
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:31,050
That's the other thing.
Imagine if you lived in Dayton,

278
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,450
Ohio and you had to do stand up.
It was like one club in town.

279
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,030
It's the only club for like 100 miles.
He just got back from there,

280
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:36,720
right man?
Yeah,

281
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:37,380
exactly.
And there's,

282
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,440
there's two clubs and there's like the 
good one and the bad one.

283
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,170
And that's what all the comedians talk 
about.

284
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,880
And there's a good one in the bad one.
Yeah.

285
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:47,880
And it's like you're always under the 
supervision of the only clubs in town.

286
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:49,710
So say you want to go up and fuck around
some night,

287
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,710
get that new second act we're talking 
about.

288
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,740
Oh,
you can't do that when they're paying 

289
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:57,740
you,
you can't do that when they're,

290
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,050
when they're paying you.
And you also can't do that if you're an 

291
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,050
open miker they're either.
Competition is so high,

292
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,330
they're gonna.
Be like,

293
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:01,260
oh,
you suck now.

294
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,550
Yeah,
sorry.

295
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,240
Yup.
That's the thing.

296
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,180
Open mic nights are fucking gigantic for
a comic.

297
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,980
Yeah.
And when you don't have open mic nights,

298
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:13,981
then you wind up doing like these,
these nights where like say you'll be 

299
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:18,631
the host,
you'll be the host of a show and you'll 

300
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:18,631
just do a couple of minutes and bring 
people up and you know,

301
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:23,551
you're essentially just kind of getting 
the audience used to the fact there's a 

302
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:25,981
comedy show,
introducing the comedians properly and 

303
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:25,981
hopefully getting a couple jokes in on 
your own.

304
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:31,050
Yeah.
But there comes a point in time there 

305
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,050
where you're,
if you're in a place where you don't get

306
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,900
stage time,
where you're not expanding.

307
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,630
Yeah.
We got lucky this,

308
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:36,160
this spot.
You could expand a lot.

309
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,740
Absolutely.
You can go to the ice house.

310
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:39,760
You can go to.
Yuck.

311
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:40,030
Yuck.

312
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,900
I've heard a lot of people shit on the,
uh,

313
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,920
the La scene,
but there's tons of places to do it 

314
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,860
underground.
There's tons of art rooms and there's 

315
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:49,860
tons of clubs.
Who Shits on the La Scene?

316
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,390
What Midwest people do.
New York people don't.

317
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,410
Absolutely.
Midwest San Francisco people do.

318
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:58,680
Everyone does midwest people shitting on
La.

319
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,300
That's hilarious.
That's a new one.

320
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,360
That's the lyric is only body.
You can't shit on the comedy scene.

321
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,630
There's too many of us.
I know and we got it.

322
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,750
We got all the New Yorker.
Well not all of them.

323
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:11,490
We got some New Yorkers.
We get some midwest.

324
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,260
All the ones who understand winter,
they move here.

325
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,630
If you understand winter and it doesn't,
you don't have to be in that like you 

326
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:20,630
know,
you don't have to be.

327
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:25,490
It's good to be in that every now and 
then to feel it because it's really 

328
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:25,490
crazy.

329
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,020
But to live there every day,
six months when it's fucking freezing is

330
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,080
very taxing.
It's good to put the ankle weights on 

331
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,080
every once in awhile.
Then take them off.

332
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,190
I go to Jen,
go January,

333
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,230
go up to fucking main.
Just hang out for a few days and then 

334
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,840
you're done.
You get out of there and you're like,

335
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:40,590
okay,
I got it.

336
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,870
I have to do that.
Yep.

337
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,040
I get it.
Yeah,

338
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,060
and that's,
that's the good.

339
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:50,090
That's the upside of touring.
Why else would there be 80 million 

340
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:50,090
people here?
Stop at Midwest.

341
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:50,590
Yeah.
Stop it to cry.

342
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,950
Whoever you are.
That's

343
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,750
talking shit on the La comedy scene.
That would be a Dana Stevens.

344
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,770
All I heard her say this,
my favorite.

345
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,980
I don't know who that is,
but almost all my favorite convenience 

346
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:02,980
live here.
Yeah,

347
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:02,980
me too.
Like Bill Burr,

348
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,670
as soon as we got burned,
it was stan.

349
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Stan hope doesn't live here,
but you take got burst and I guess 

350
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,071
Louise in New York and there's always a 
bunch of guys that are really good in 

351
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:15,071
New York,
New York,

352
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:19,041
so always got a towel.
New York is always one of the best 

353
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:19,370
scenes,
but patent is out here.

354
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,940
Um,
you know,

355
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,380
cowens out here.
There's cigarettes out here.

356
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,680
Joey Diaz is out here.
Ari Shaffir sometimes out here.

357
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,350
He's a,
he's a bow by coastal,

358
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,430
right?
Yeah.

359
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,190
He's a jet setter.
That arch fear internationally known.

360
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:37,910
Locally accepted.
Motherfuckers just got back from China.

361
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,380
Yeah,
I saw those pictures.

362
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:40,370
What was he doing out there?

363
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,070
Super Ball in.
He's just super bald.

364
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,100
Murdering it.
Selling out in China is murdering all 

365
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,100
over the world.
Telling everyone to go there though,

366
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,620
like,
oh yeah,

367
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,510
no.
For him,

368
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,420
it sounds like it was a pretty bad ass 
life experience,

369
00:15:56,421 --> 00:16:01,421
but he.
He introduced us to a bunch of aspects 

370
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:03,620
of China that I'm just so not interested
in experiencing.

371
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,410
Like what was the motor oil?
I'd be scared to eat.

372
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,230
How could you not eat or trust the water
or go to the bathroom?

373
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:14,231
Just going to the bathroom,
like leaving a nice bathroom just in 

374
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:17,321
case if you have to go to the bathroom 
somewhere else and it be like to the 

375
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:17,321
point where you could die.
He's sit there too long.

376
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,440
People die in toilets.
They fall into the toilets,

377
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:23,190
like to get cell phones.
We had a,

378
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,770
a story that we're reading.
The other day,

379
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,980
guy dropped his cell phone,
went to reach for it,

380
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:29,930
pass out from the fumes,
fell in the wife,

381
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:30,440
went after him.

382
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,880
She fell out,
fell asleep too,

383
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,470
and they died.
Oh my God.

384
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,460
Yeah.
They couldn't breathe.

385
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,170
Wasn't much methane and shit.
Water couldn't.

386
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,750
Yes,
it's awful.

387
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:44,020
They died for a fucking cell phone.
Usually taking a shit as a great 

388
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,020
experience.
Not,

389
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,360
not holy.
It's just you gotta.

390
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,550
You can't shit in the same spot forever.
You've got to do something about that.

391
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,580
That's really a bad smell,
man.

392
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,230
Sooner or later you're going to have to 
flush.

393
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,440
That was disturbing,
but it was even more disturbing is 

394
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,440
already was telling us about gutter oil,
which is a,

395
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,091
um,
an oil cooking oil that they make from 

396
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:04,091
raw sewage.
Oh my God.

397
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,690
I can't even imagine.
I can't even imagine.

398
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,560
You have to watch it to,
to believe that you're,

399
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,550
what you're seeing.
Cooking oil is very expensive,

400
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,730
so a lot of people create their own 
cooking oil and they use rancid meat 

401
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,110
like old bones and meat and stuff like 
that.

402
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,720
Boil it down.
And they also use raw sewage,

403
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,590
raw sewage mix in with it.
It's insanely fucked up.

404
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,040
We played a video of it the other day.
I just think we're not going to play it 

405
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,711
again,
but I encourage you to go online and 

406
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:35,320
anybody who wants to see it look up a 
gutter oil anytime people are like,

407
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,550
you got to have some authentic Chinese 
food.

408
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,470
Just be like,
no thanks.

409
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Watch the red podcasts.
It was actually podcast Numero dos or 

410
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,150
the first one,
dose doses.

411
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:49,151
We came back,
he wanted to talk to us about the 

412
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,861
cooking oil.
We'd run out of time and it was one of 

413
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:50,861
the most harrowing stories.
Almost puked,

414
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,180
didn't you?
I heard that.

415
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,470
Yeah,
and then I had to point out to them to 

416
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,590
die hosted fear factor for six years and
I got really close to pukey.

417
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,540
People forget that.

418
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,100
I've seen a lot of shit.
I've seen people eat rats.

419
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,660
Right.
And that was almost throwing up.

420
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,340
It was just so shit.
I.

421
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,880
I started extra salivating right now 
just thinking about it like that,

422
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,960
that feeling that you get right before 
you,

423
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,660
you Yak.
She was.

424
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,840
She had these long like scoops and she 
was scooping raw sewage out into 

425
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:27,031
buckets.
Where do they carry the buckets to our 

426
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:29,221
car and she'd put these buckets of the 
card that you would drive off and that 

427
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:29,221
you'd sell it.
And she was.

428
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:32,140
They were talking about how she bought 
herself a house from the money from this

429
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:34,690
gutter oil,
so she'd been lifting manhole covers,

430
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:39,691
scooping out raw sewage when you're 
doing it boiling and selling it and they

431
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:44,881
use.
They said one in 10 of those street 

432
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:44,881
vendors are using

433
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:46,010
gutter oil.
I don't understand when it was.

434
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:49,620
Just don't use nothing.
Why don't you have to cook?

435
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,580
You don't understand Chinese food I 
guess,

436
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,000
but yeah,
they cook and walks big bitch dude.

437
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,830
Raw sewage boiled down.
It doesn't even seem real

438
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,810
and he also poop in the streets.
It's normal for them just to poop in the

439
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:09,811
streets.
It's like they'll just drop trial and 

440
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:09,811
just go take a load off right there.
You Go.

441
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:11,050
Down to skid row in downtown Los 
Angeles.

442
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:14,500
We're still not doing that.
Some people are just happy with the fact

443
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,020
they have to shit differently.
I saw,

444
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,120
I thought the other day on a highland 
know where that church is.

445
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,170
Highland and Franklin or whatever it is.
A guy was shooting this woman that kind 

446
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:24,310
of,
I think lives at that church,

447
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:26,910
homeless woman,
but she just decided to not just go into

448
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:28,510
the lane,
that turning lane,

449
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,390
just take off her clothes and just start
shooting right there and cars were like,

450
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,260
are you really just shitting right here 
is growth,

451
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,640
is that the light?
Just had to look.

452
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,950
Actually,
you didn't have to look.

453
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,830
Of course you did.
Why you have,

454
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,890
even if it's not pleasant,
fleas

455
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,350
shitting in the middle of the street.
Yeah.

456
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,700
Yeah.
Look,

457
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,490
quality of life is something that people
work really hard to preserve.

458
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,110
A lot of folks are really worried about 
that,

459
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:59,111
especially as they get older.
Young people don't worry about it so 

460
00:19:59,111 --> 00:19:59,111
much,
but old people,

461
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:00,680
especially if you've traveled a few 
different places,

462
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:01,580
you realize,
wow,

463
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:05,270
things can get out of hand if you have.
If you have too much homeless,

464
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,550
too much poverty,
too much this,

465
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:12,551
too much that you can get to a point.
There's examples over there today that 

466
00:20:12,551 --> 00:20:16,991
you could go to China.
You can see examples of this is what 

467
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:19,421
happens when you get overpopulation and 
people are devalued and life becomes 

468
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:20,570
very different than what you're 
accustomed to.

469
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,520
Yeah,
that's exactly what you're experiencing.

470
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,740
You know,
that is a good.

471
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,800
That's a good indication that maybe the 
people in the midwest are right.

472
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,490
That maybe like being in a place like la
is just too fucked up.

473
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,050
I just think they're off with comedy 
living there.

474
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:38,850
Like there's.
There's some real benefits to living.

475
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:40,570
Like in Seattle,
I was taught,

476
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:45,571
I was talking to Brian about that today.
We're talking about how great Seattle 

477
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:48,791
is.
This is some real benefits to living 

478
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,300
there as opposed to living here.
Absolutely lower number of people,

479
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:51,250
less stressed.
The energy's different.

480
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:55,240
It's not as chaotic.
It's not as showbiz based like there's a

481
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,110
ton of like positive things that you 
could connect to a place like Seattle.

482
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,520
Good air,
good breathing.

483
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,450
Yeah.
The water.

484
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:06,451
The fact that it rains all the time.
You get depressed if you're a fucking 

485
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:09,841
little baby,
but the reality is that's where life 

486
00:21:09,841 --> 00:21:09,841
come from.
Head.

487
00:21:09,841 --> 00:21:14,300
It comes from water.
It's good that it's raining all the 

488
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,300
time.
Sorry,

489
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Kurt Cobain,
sorry Kurt.

490
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,530
I think Kurt was more depressed about 
heroin is blaming it on the rain.

491
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,820
Yeah,
it was all heroin.

492
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,770
Just come on man.
It's a lot of people up there smiling.

493
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,800
You're shooting yourself.
There's a hell of a hangover going with 

494
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,980
heroin attack.
Imagine that guy stayed alive.

495
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,220
If we could keep that guy happy enough 
to keep making music.

496
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,880
What a fucking groundbreaking genius.
I know.

497
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,000
I really,
I really,

498
00:21:36,001 --> 00:21:38,500
I really think it's a huge tragedy for a
lot of people.

499
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:41,200
Like to joke about it.
I think he was so fucking good.

500
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,300
I forget how good it is and every time I
hear it,

501
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,080
it's just like

502
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,020
so beautiful.
His Muse and an awesome impact.

503
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:52,021
I mean,
he had an awesome impact for the few 

504
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:52,300
years that he was alive.
But yeah,

505
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,060
that guy changed the whole thing the 
whole time.

506
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,670
It's just a fucking kid,
man.

507
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,910
I was at this guy's house,
um,

508
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,520
my friend's friend,
like a friend of a friend that we were,

509
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:05,200
uh,
he had a copy of it.

510
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:08,140
I think it was a cassette at the time 
and he played nirvana.

511
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,950
We were both sitting around,
me and my friend going,

512
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:13,570
wow,
and the guy was like,

513
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,930
people didn't really play music for 
their friends very often.

514
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,020
Like it would have to be something 
really cool for someone to go through.

515
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,240
You've got to listen to this and I want 
to listen to it with you.

516
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,860
Yeah,
I want to see your reaction.

517
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,670
Three of us are standing by this dude's 
waterbed listening to this,

518
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:33,020
you know,
he had like a boombox and he's playing 

519
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,020
it.
We were like,

520
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,430
whoa.
Do you remember which song?

521
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,800
It was always a team spirit or was it 
teen spirit?

522
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,050
He's was the one my band played teen 
spirit in high school.

523
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,920
Now every time my mom hears on the 
radio,

524
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:41,760
she was like,
ah.

525
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,280
I'm like,
it's not my song.

526
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,030
He played a couple of other ones.
He played a cup.

527
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,200
Well otherwise from the,
uh,

528
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,480
the same album,
a couple of other songs,

529
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:52,440
we were like,
whoa.

530
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,150
That shit was a knockout because I was 
into like punk rock and rock and roll.

531
00:22:57,151 --> 00:22:59,520
That wasn't exactly metal at the time.
And we're kind of.

532
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:02,190
Jane's addiction was pretty great.
All these bands are pretty great.

533
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,110
Then Nirvana came along and just kicked 
it.

534
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,340
Knocked it out of the fucking room.

535
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,100
They.
Yeah.

536
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:07,420
Well,
you know what a Nirvana did.

537
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,160
It killed hairbands.
Yeah.

538
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:14,420
Like any bravo.
He says that's because Eddie Bravo was 

539
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,420
in a hairband.
Yeah.

540
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,460
He was looking at a metal band.
The hairbands and pissed.

541
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,550
Oh yeah.
They do not like Nirvana.

542
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,960
Well,
it came along and all of a sudden.

543
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:21,460
What?
You're allowed to wear flannel shirt.

544
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:25,050
I have leather pants,
tight leather pants like I'm supposed to

545
00:23:25,051 --> 00:23:26,130
have.
We can't get them off.

546
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,160
I'm wearing platform shoes.
How come I can't wear platform shoes 

547
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,160
anymore?
What?

548
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,820
Sneakers?
Whoa.

549
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,440
Converse.
All stars are you fucking kidding me?

550
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,110
I'm not wearing converse.
All stars in a fucking file shirt.

551
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,690
Uh,
what happened to be in a rockstar that's

552
00:23:39,691 --> 00:23:43,380
over?
You got to be sad and regular now.

553
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,130
Yeah.
Is that what it is now?

554
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,270
You got to be sad.
Reg.

555
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:49,610
John Meyer doesn't seem very mayor.
No,

556
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:49,900
no,
no.

557
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,410
I'm in a mayor.
Doesn't seem very sad.

558
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,540
No,
I meant at the time.

559
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,540
At the time.
Yeah.

560
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:58,750
Yeah.
You had to be depressed as fuck to be 

561
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:58,750
taken seriously,
you know,

562
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,350
lots of dudes on here,
alice and chains of heroin and he wrote 

563
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:03,840
about it,
you know,

564
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,920
and you could hear what he was saying in
his songs to like that song,

565
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:08,270
bones,
dem bones,

566
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:13,570
dem bones,
and like there's songs called like junk 

567
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,020
sick.
The whole album dirt is about heroin,

568
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,180
openly,
openly about heroin.

569
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:22,181
And it's awesome and it's fantastic.
It's their best album down in a whole 

570
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:23,810
buck cherry.
I've never done cocaine,

571
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:26,090
but buck,
Buck Cherry has a song about cocaine.

572
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:31,091
Yeah.
That makes you want to try cocaine 

573
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:31,091
because I'm not,
I'm not,

574
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:32,120
I don't want to try it.
I'm not,

575
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,690
I'm not in.

576
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,810
It just seems like a bad one,
but they're so good.

577
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:40,811
And it's about cocaine.
There's only been a couple of really 

578
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:40,811
good songs.
There's,

579
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:41,780
of course the Eric Clapton Song.
Cocaine.

580
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,580
Yeah.
There's of course that one.

581
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,390
Is that,
was that,

582
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:45,800
um,
um,

583
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,620
Derek and the dominos?
Or was that Eric Clapton?

584
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,480
Was that when he was with Derrick and 
the dominoes?

585
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,700
I'm really not sure.
I think it's just eric.

586
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,630
He always just say it's by Eric Clapton.
That's a fucking bad ass jam.

587
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,000
That's one of the all time.
That's not a pro heroin song though.

588
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,080
No,
no,

589
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,630
no.
It was not a pro cocaine either.

590
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,170
I mean,
yeah,

591
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,220
pro camp.
That's what I meant.

592
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,320
No,
it's not a Buck Cherries.

593
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,210
That's a pro cocaine song.
Yeah,

594
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,770
it's.
I love the cocaine.

595
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:14,100
I love the lit up again.
Yeah.

596
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,180
I'm all lit up again.
It's a great fucking song and it's a pro

597
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:17,990
cocaine song.

598
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,300
Wow.
That cocaine song was actually not Eric 

599
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:23,360
Clapton and it was a cover of a guy 
named Jj cale.

600
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,580
Who did it well,
I'd like to hear the original version of

601
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:27,770
that now.
See if he could find that shit.

602
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:29,150
Yeah,
we'll get kicked off youtube,

603
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:31,880
but fuck it.
I think it's all fair use.

604
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:35,390
I think they can suck it.
I'm tired of this stupid.

605
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:40,510
Anytime we we.
I mean we're just playing shit that's 

606
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,571
online.
We're not stealing any context and so 

607
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:46,030
you typically commenting on things that 
are readily available and youtube gets 

608
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,070
mad sometimes people put up that fucking
crazy guy.

609
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,150
This is the original guy was an old 
blues dude.

610
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,460
How old is this dude here?
It's 1976 to take around cocaine.

611
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,350
That guy looks like a subtle and elbow.
The whole thing that George Bush on the 

612
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:26,100
drugs,
and this is the original version,

613
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,030
is that w on the drum that's.

614
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,130
See there's a conviction.
That guy's voice.

615
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,040
Yeah.
No,

616
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:38,050
he wrote it.
He meant it is done cocaine.

617
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,350
He could use a couple of bosses.

618
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,130
No.
Yeah.

619
00:26:58,131 --> 00:27:00,050
He's not the most energetic guy,
but I like.

620
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:05,051
It isn't a weird though.
How some people's voices like in that 

621
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:05,240
aspect,
when that scene or just more compelling.

622
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,430
Yes.
That guy's got a compelling voice.

623
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,710
Whatever reason I want to hear him keep 
talking.

624
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:13,490
Exactly like Johnny cash.
Johnny cash.

625
00:27:13,491 --> 00:27:18,491
Towards the end,
he was doing some of his best stuff and 

626
00:27:18,491 --> 00:27:18,491
he wasn't even singing anymore.
He was essentially talking.

627
00:27:18,491 --> 00:27:19,310
Right.
You know,

628
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,040
but it's still so compelling.
It was heavy.

629
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,260
It fucking heavy.
Yeah.

630
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,130
Something comes through in people's 
voices and I don't know what it is.

631
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,840
You know?
I don't know.

632
00:27:29,841 --> 00:27:33,280
What makes one person's voice more 
appealing?

633
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:38,290
One first person's voice more 
emotionally connected to your brain.

634
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,010
I don't know what,
what,

635
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:45,070
what it is,
but like some people just have voices 

636
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,070
that you like.
Orson Welles,

637
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,040
you ever listen to Orson Welles?
Yeah.

638
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,830
The guy who did the war of the worlds 
did it on the radio.

639
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,970
Citizen Kane.
Yeah.

640
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Citizen Kane.
He was compelling to listen to him talk 

641
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,330
or he used to do those wine commercials 
towards the end.

642
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,280
We will sell no wine before it's time.
He just had.

643
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:03,130
There's something about his voice like 
the guy could,

644
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,160
you could just have them talk about your
stuff and it would make your stuff more 

645
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,160
awesome.
It was an authority.

646
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,160
We will,
so no more.

647
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,230
Once I started,
it was all fucked up.

648
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:17,260
Drinking wine and shit.
They have recordings if you don't like 

649
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:17,260
yelling about how preposterous.
The,

650
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,500
uh,
the copy he was reading was,

651
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:23,501
he was awesome.
Citizen Kane came out when he was 25 

652
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:23,501
years old.
Yeah.

653
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:28,121
He knocked it out of the park is first 
try one of the greatest movies of all 

654
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:29,390
time,
but then hurts what to do after that

655
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,870
hurts.
Squash that movie.

656
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:32,640
It was only out for a couple of weeks or
something.

657
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:35,250
The guy that was about willed,
William Randolph

658
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,410
hearst.
Hearst.

659
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,200
Yes.
First.

660
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:37,540
Yeah.

661
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,530
He squashed it because it was actually 
about him and it was in a negative light

662
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,130
and then you know,
it was out of the theaters immediately 

663
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,610
and it's not like you can watch the Shit
on cable back in the day.

664
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,410
Yeah.
He was just kind of.

665
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,590
It just kind of didn't work.
Even though we look back and we see it's

666
00:28:53,591 --> 00:28:55,840
great.
It was off everyone's brain.

667
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:56,130
I think

668
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,950
so what,
what movies did he do after that

669
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,740
touch of evil,
but it was all.

670
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,320
It was all.
Nothing was as big as or yeah,

671
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:10,510
citizen Kane is the one that everyone 
looks to as really great and nothing 

672
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:10,670
else really.
I don't think.

673
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,780
Well,
he was responsible for that and of 

674
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:15,780
course the war of the worlds thing,
that shit was huge.

675
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,010
People were jumping off bridges.
I don't know if that's really true.

676
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:20,110
I think snopes that,
yeah,

677
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,380
let's find out war of the world,

678
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,500
but it was something really incredible 
what he did and it's something we do all

679
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:29,050
the time now.
We imitate a certain style,

680
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:33,730
like we imitate the news all the time in
entertainment shows we entertain,

681
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,540
we imitate documentaries all the time in
comedies.

682
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,060
He imitated a newsreel and everyone 
thought it was real.

683
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,340
Well,

684
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:45,340
he read a book,
what he read it as as though he was 

685
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,750
like,
it was a news report and so they'd.

686
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,580
But they'd also have like A.
Yeah,

687
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:49,870
it is a myth.
Oh,

688
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,680
is it?
Yeah.

689
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:56,370
Yup.
Mass panic and hysteria swept through 

690
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,501
United States on the eve of Halloween,
1938 when an all too realistic radio 

691
00:29:58,501 --> 00:30:03,300
dramatization of the war.
A world sent untold thousands of people 

692
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:03,760
into the streets headed for the hills.
This is a,

693
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,610
it's an urban legend.
Apparently.

694
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:11,790
That's too bad.
It's accurately misremembered like no 

695
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,080
other radio program where essentially 
they're saying is,

696
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,980
it's,
this is all from a bbc if anybody's 

697
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:19,980
interested.
Gotcha.

698
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,700
Just the Halloween myth of the war of 
the worlds panic and uh,

699
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,040
it looks like it's all very,
very exaggerated,

700
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,960
but they do it really cool.
Like they'd have,

701
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:35,070
they'd have like regular programming and
then they interrupt it with the news 

702
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,280
reports of aliens invading and they'd be
like,

703
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:38,350
now back to our regular scheduled 
program.

704
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,990
It just be like music and stuff.
This is funny.

705
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:43,540
Listen to what they said back then.
Radio is new,

706
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,720
but it has adult responsibilities.
It's the fucking Internet chided the New

707
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,760
York Times.
It has not mastered itself or the 

708
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,401
material it uses.
So people were angry that Orson Welles 

709
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:58,300
did this war of the worlds.
But imagine the New York Times said that

710
00:30:58,301 --> 00:31:02,470
about radio back then radio,
his new holy Shit.

711
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,770
It's so funny.
That makes my skin tingle.

712
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,740
I can't believe I'm even.
I can read that.

713
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,290
I can read some people that were 
writers,

714
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,900
The New York Times that we're 
essentially talking about radio.

715
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:19,110
The way people talk about the Internet.
That sentence easily could be about the 

716
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,110
internet.
Yeah.

717
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,030
That it has or has not mastered itself 
or the material it uses.

718
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,740
Yes,
it's new.

719
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:25,840
But it has adult responsibilities.
Yeah,

720
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,430
yeah,
yeah.

721
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,890
That is the Internet.
Yep.

722
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,510
So what's going to happen is we're all 
gonna get censored very soon.

723
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,580
Just like radio.
Well,

724
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:35,530
radio didn't eventually get censored 
though.

725
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:38,050
It got sentenced for awhile and then 
became satellite radio,

726
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:40,040
which is way more popular.
Oh yeah.

727
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,940
Satellite Radio is essentially smushed 
regular radio.

728
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,840
It's when everyone knows they can get 
opie and anthony every morning,

729
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,850
you know,
and you can get on your car if you're in

730
00:31:48,851 --> 00:31:51,490
Pittsburgh or if in New York or you're 
going to let.

731
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:54,270
You can get Howard stern every day.
You get to use his own.

732
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,990
There's two channels.
It's like,

733
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:58,090
wow,
why am I listening to this local guys,

734
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,390
this local guy that good.
You'll,

735
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,500
you'll give the local guy five minutes.
He says one wacky thing like this dumb 

736
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,050
motherfucker.
And then you get to turn into Jim 

737
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,050
Norton.
I know because you've got to sit through

738
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,030
20 minutes of commercials on regular 
radio just to hear subpar content.

739
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,480
It's awful.
It's.

740
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,150
There's only a few good ones left.

741
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:21,180
There's like maybe a dozen in the whole 
country is maybe a dozen radio stations 

742
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,180
that are worth doing.
It's a mess.

743
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,250
Yeah,
and why?

744
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,810
What happened?
It's because it was censored.

745
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:28,060
They couldn't keep up.
You can't compete,

746
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:33,061
man.
If you listen to these not fucks that 

747
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:33,061
tell you.
You can't say certain words,

748
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:33,490
you're going to lose us.
Yeah.

749
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,290
Where there's more of us.
Do you not get it?

750
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:40,291
They're really loud,
but there's way more people that don't 

751
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,561
give a fuck.
There's way more people that would way 

752
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,851
rather hear uncensored stuff.
That's why when you look at Internet 

753
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:46,040
videos and they have a million fucking 
heads,

754
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,200
that's what all that is.
It's like those are people.

755
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:53,201
Those are the same people that watch NBC
because the same people that listen to 

756
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:53,960
am radio,
they're just fucking people.

757
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,630
They're adults.
They can pick and choose what they want.

758
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,810
They don't need you to tell them.
They should just oral abandoned,

759
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,120
ship,
abandoned ship.

760
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:07,010
All regulations here by now,
abandoned programming will now commence.

761
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,560
Do whatever the fuck you want.
If people like it to watch.

762
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,830
If they don't,
it's harder to get ABC than it is to get

763
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:13,830
cable.
Yes.

764
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,950
It's harder if you.
What are you going to do?

765
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:20,951
You're going to have antennas.
You're going to get fucking rabbit ears 

766
00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:22,220
and with the tvs even have those 
anymore.

767
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,820
I don't know.
So you got to get cable for a lot of 

768
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,581
folks.
Basic cable at least just to get your 

769
00:33:30,581 --> 00:33:31,370
local channels just to get the big four 
right to get CBS,

770
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:32,660
NBC,
ABC,

771
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:33,950
Fox.
You just need an antenna.

772
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,590
Digital Antenna,
bitch.

773
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,360
All you need is the internet sober,
sober,

774
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:42,620
abandoned ship.
It's like you guys can't keep this up.

775
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,800
Comedy,
comedy clubs,

776
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:49,870
comedy clubs.
Still think morning radio is something 

777
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:49,870
to do though is it helps.

778
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:49,870
It does,
right?

779
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,760
It does help if you have a good Dj,
if you have a good dj and they have good

780
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:55,580
people in.
I mean it's got to sell tickets.

781
00:33:55,581 --> 00:34:00,581
People looking for things to do on 
Friday night and they feel like they 

782
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:00,581
know you a little bit.
You know,

783
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:00,650
they hear you in the morning like,
Hey,

784
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:02,330
I'm matt filter on guys.
It's pretty funny.

785
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:02,710
I like,
right.

786
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,720
That guy's name down.
He got along with Johnny Wild Johnny 

787
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,430
wild and him had a blast together.
It was so cool listening to you guys.

788
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,620
Johnny wilds,
my favorite person.

789
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,060
Yeah man.
They got abandoned.

790
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:19,340
Ship,
abandon ship.

791
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,870
The fucking game of thrones has arrived.
It's over.

792
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,120
Yeah.
Abandoned ship.

793
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:30,350
And how great is it?
It's official over everyone on earth has

794
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:31,730
a podcast.
Abandoned,

795
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,720
abandoned.
I feel bad for him though.

796
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:40,930
You know,
a lot of people still go to school to 

797
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:40,930
become a radio Dj,
you know,

798
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:44,000
like look at all the open anthony 
interns that are in radio.

799
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,660
It's weird that it's still a profession.
Is it weird though?

800
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:52,661
What if you were a guy who was a really 
good horse mechanic and you're really 

801
00:34:52,661 --> 00:34:56,321
good at like making wagons and you're 
bummed out that someone invented a car 

802
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:57,000
that's life.
Keep moving,

803
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,970
bitch.
She can be a lot worse.

804
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,760
And while you keep moving,
keep moving.

805
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,510
Keep moving,
bitch.

806
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,990
Yeah,
get up telcos.

807
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:08,420
It's how it's how it goes and we'll have
to go through the only way it goes.

808
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,170
Yeah,
it is.

809
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:11,540
The only way it goes if you try to do it
any other way,

810
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:16,750
you stifle progress,
so cut the shit and abandoned ship 

811
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,610
that's can do it though anymore.
That's a big lesson in life.

812
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:21,830
You can insist that things need to be 
the way they were.

813
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:27,030
It's key.
It can never be the way it was because 

814
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,170
if it was,
you'd be a single cell organism.

815
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,540
You fuckhead.
Right,

816
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,760
okay.
It's ridiculous and those were good 

817
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,191
times.
I guess there was a time of no 

818
00:35:36,191 --> 00:35:36,191
responsibility.
Yeah,

819
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,800
those were the days.
No phone bill.

820
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,080
Yeah,
just muck muck in the ocean,

821
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,820
chilling about waiting for the aliens to
come and mix the DNA in there.

822
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,100
Like in that movie,
you see that movie?

823
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,870
What movie?
Which one was it?

824
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:51,430
Promethium promethium.
The prequel.

825
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,660
Right to alien.
I saw like five seconds of that.

826
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:56,460
I was flipping channels that's got 
chewed up.

827
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,770
Charlie's could have been fucking 
amazing.

828
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:02,580
It's Charlie's Tehran in that the 
hottest astronaut ever was pretty hot.

829
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,280
Pretty God damn hot and pretty bossy 
too.

830
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,860
Something hot about a hot,
bossy,

831
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,760
bossy chicken space.
Right.

832
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:15,000
Running shit and fucking the military 
guys on your terms.

833
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:19,910
I'll tell you it telling you what,
that would be great.

834
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:25,050
Special effects are pretty dope too,
but something was missing in that movie.

835
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,660
The movie just didn't quite.
I mean,

836
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:29,010
I enjoyed it,
but it just didn't.

837
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,990
It wasn't alien.
Was Aliens in it now?

838
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,700
Yes.
Yes.

839
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,060
Spoiler alert,
but not as much came out.

840
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,850
Somebody got mad about us about the life
of Pi.

841
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,780
Some fucking dude was all angry online.
I mean he might be just be a troll so we

842
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:47,350
might be feeding trolls.
Right?

843
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,300
Like,
come on man,

844
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:50,160
you get a spoiler alert about the old 
school.

845
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,240
See you next week.

846
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,650
Well you should've got on that shit.
If you really want to see it came out in

847
00:36:53,651 --> 00:36:56,130
2012.
You still bitch.

848
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,110
When they don't understand is if you 
really are that concerned about a movie.

849
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,890
If you hear any hint of somebody saying,
I'm talking about a movie,

850
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,900
you just stop listening immediately.
Like if we start talking about life of 

851
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:07,900
Pi,
that's when you go,

852
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,110
all right,
they're going to say something.

853
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:13,190
Yeah.
Well we talked about it for like 10 

854
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,190
minutes.
It's just been on DVD for a year.

855
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,050
How long does it take to shut off your 
iphone?

856
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,670
Right?
Reached down.

857
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,780
Fast forward.
Yeah.

858
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:19,480
It's been on DVD for a long time.
We listened to the podcast.

859
00:37:19,481 --> 00:37:20,860
You should be watching that fucking 
movie.

860
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:22,660
You want to see.
You know what's funny?

861
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:26,020
When you have a movie like that and it 
gets on NBC,

862
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,170
the network television premier that used
to mean something.

863
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,620
Right now it means you're slow as fuck.
You know?

864
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:37,621
It used to mean something.
They like get on Hbo first and then it 

865
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:38,170
would be the network television premier 
and you'd go,

866
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:40,470
Whoa,
nbcs got that movie.

867
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,820
You remember that.
It was like a big deal.

868
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:45,130
It's like,
well now this movie is legitimate.

869
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,100
This is the network television premier,
right?

870
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,180
Like,
oh no,

871
00:37:49,181 --> 00:37:49,510
no,
no,

872
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:49,840
no,
no,

873
00:37:49,841 --> 00:37:50,230
no,
no,

874
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:50,860
it's not.
No,

875
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,030
this is you guys being super late,
right?

876
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:58,080
First of all is in the movies.
You always in the movies and we can do 

877
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,080
go to the movies too.
I've ever.

878
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,020
Star wars came out and like 88 on like 
NBC came out like 1988.

879
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,340
It was a big deal.
Remember?

880
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:08,350
That was.
That was a movie they kept coming back 

881
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:08,350
to the theaters.
Yup,

882
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:08,350
Yup.
Yeah.

883
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:12,790
I'm the wasn't.
There was TV movies when that was the 

884
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,430
big thing where you would sit home and 
there'd be like a movie that was made by

885
00:38:13,431 --> 00:38:17,550
NBC or CBS and ABC and some of them even
lasted weeks.

886
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:20,570
Like they were just Salem's lot.
Yeah.

887
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,200
Made for TV movies.
We're big poison ivy with Michael J.

888
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Fox and intimate came.
They did a new version of the shining 

889
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,981
with the guy from wings.
I remember when that happened because 

890
00:38:32,981 --> 00:38:37,210
they were like,
the shining doesn't really keep it real 

891
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:37,210
to the book.
Yeah.

892
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:37,210
And we're like,
yeah,

893
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:37,210
but it's

894
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:37,210
good.
Yeah.

895
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,520
They decided to UNCW,
rubric it.

896
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,870
Right.
And it wasn't,

897
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,610
uh,
wasn't so hot.

898
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:48,060
Have you ever heard the.
The idea is that there's all these like 

899
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,730
conspiracies or like hints in the 
shining of like the moon landing and 

900
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:51,820
this,
that and the other.

901
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:56,240
There was definitely references to a kid
wore and Apollo tee shirt and there's,

902
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,320
there's a bunch of documentaries that 
breakdown all the connections between 

903
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:06,090
the technology,
the distance between the earth and the 

904
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,840
moon being representative.
And all sorts of weird shit.

905
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,150
The documentary gave me blue balls 
really bad though.

906
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,350
I was like,
alright,

907
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,400
I want to believe all this shit.
And like it just never connected that 

908
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,191
well for me.
I think if I was a filmmaker I'd be 

909
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:20,940
fascinated by it because I think Kubrick
was secure.

910
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Brick is one of those rare minds that 
was operating on a bunch of different 

911
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,420
sort of levels at the same time.

912
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:33,590
Like I think that he was writing a 
script and creating this sort of 

913
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,080
theatrical piece where you'd see Jack 
Nicholson get angry and,

914
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:43,260
but in his mind that wasn't enough and 
he would add all of this like hidden 

915
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,181
meaning things symbology and all this 
weird stuff that he would add to it that

916
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:53,821
would just kind of leave people to 
decipher like why exactly this number,

917
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:57,070
what exactly was that supposed to 
represent?

918
00:39:57,071 --> 00:40:02,071
And he had a bunch of shit attached to 
it that didn't necessarily even have to 

919
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:02,890
be in the movie.
That's it.

920
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:04,630
Room to 37.
Yeah,

921
00:40:04,631 --> 00:40:06,660
I saw that.
I wasn't crazy about it.

922
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,760
I couldn't get through it.
Um,

923
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,460
but I thought it was interesting that 
people thought he was,

924
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,050
he was the actual one who faked the moon
landing.

925
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:16,060
He was the one hired to do that.
Well,

926
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:21,120
the theory being,
well there's zero evidence that shows 

927
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,841
that he did,
but there is a bunch of evidence that 

928
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:27,301
shows that he was working with Nasa and 
that he got a lot of consulting with 

929
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:30,490
them when he was creating a 19,
69 when he was doing in 2001.

930
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,260
That makes sense though.
Of course,

931
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,480
of course it makes sense that he would 
consult with them.

932
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,840
Why would you,
if you were a huge movie movie producer,

933
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:38,490
you're,
you know,

934
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,850
a guy who makes these perfect movies.
I mean he made Dr.

935
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,050
strangelove was fantastic and he'd made.
He was a wizard.

936
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,010
Clockwork orange.
The guys wizard.

937
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:54,070
Yeah.
A guy like that must put incredible 

938
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,451
amounts of consideration to every single
aspect when you're doing something like 

939
00:40:57,451 --> 00:40:57,451
space travel.
Yeah.

940
00:40:57,451 --> 00:40:59,200
Of course you would have some sort of 
relationship with NASA.

941
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:04,260
Right?
But if someone was going to be able to 

942
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:04,260
fake the moon landing,
probably be that dude.

943
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:04,570
Yeah.
I mean,

944
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,630
it probably be only that dude at that 
time,

945
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,810
George Lucas,
he was a baby at that time.

946
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,680
George was probably like in his twenties
going on.

947
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,830
That was 1969 to 1972 was when they 
filmed it in 68.

948
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:25,411
And I'm just kidding.
Do you ever see that Roger Moore 

949
00:41:25,411 --> 00:41:27,450
documentary or Roger Moore?
James Bond when he's,

950
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,470
uh,
he's being chased by these bad guys that

951
00:41:29,471 --> 00:41:31,980
he runs through a set of the moon.
Uh,

952
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,710
yeah,
yeah,

953
00:41:32,711 --> 00:41:33,290
yeah,
yeah,

954
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:33,890
yeah,
yeah.

955
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,780
I never got that as a kid,
but yeah,

956
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:36,680
I get that.
Yeah.

957
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:38,870
It's funny.
They were filming the Moon,

958
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:44,620
filming the Moon Landings,
how to rock it out and Roger Moore goes 

959
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:44,620
running through it.
Yeah.

960
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:49,451
James Bond.
Sean connery and Roger Moore had to be 

961
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:49,451
Roger Moore because they turned into 
comedy is after Roger Moore.

962
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:52,400
Yeah.
It's an interesting term.

963
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:53,630
Wacky.
Yeah.

964
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:54,020
Double.
Oh,

965
00:41:54,021 --> 00:41:58,150
seven became like a little wacky sort of
a burt reynolds ask.

966
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:03,390
It's kind of weird.
It was like a smokey and the bandit 

967
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,100
type,
almost like Benny Hill music playing 

968
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,100
while he's chasing people around.
Right.

969
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,400
And he was always.
Yeah.

970
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,960
And then you get Daniel Craig,
which is totally the more like the book,

971
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:17,320
right?
He's more like the real double o seven 

972
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,320
literature,
literature,

973
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,760
literary character.
Have you seen the double of seven 

974
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,270
documentary where it takes you from the 
beginning all the way to the current?

975
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,280
No,
because it's really good because,

976
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:30,281
um,
it started obviously with that guy 

977
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,991
writing books about James Bond and there
was even an American version called 

978
00:42:31,991 --> 00:42:32,430
Jimmy bond first.

979
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,750
Oh really?
Yeah.

980
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:39,260
It was all black and white and he's got 
an American accent and oh my God,

981
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:41,390
it's really bad.
His name is Jimmy Bond.

982
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,400
Yeah.
They made American version for the 

983
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,840
British army.
Sean connery.

984
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,740
Please find that.
And you know about the,

985
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,950
you know about the guy that only did one
James Bond movie?

986
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:57,250
No,
there's a guy that that was between 

987
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,201
Roger Moore and Sean Connery and he kind
of got influenced by the hippie movement

988
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:05,470
and grew his hair all long and started 
doing all these public statements about 

989
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:08,870
the war.
And they dropped him in a second because

990
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:11,570
he didn't fit the image anymore.
No Shit.

991
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,270
And he was really disappointed.
He's always been disappointed by it.

992
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:19,650
You know that he did that,
that he did that because you only got 

993
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,001
one movie.
He would have been set for life and he 

994
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:22,001
kind of locked them out too.
Right?

995
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:25,750
They locked him out and he.
He seems to think he was kind of 

996
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,840
influenced by like all these outside 
guys like,

997
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:27,980
Hey,
you have this voice now.

998
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:32,981
You need to express all these opinions,
and he felt like he didn't necessarily 

999
00:43:32,981 --> 00:43:34,280
really want to do it.
He just felt pressured to do it.

1000
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,520
The first guy was Barry Nelson in 1954.
That's the American you think?

1001
00:43:39,771 --> 00:43:40,730
Or is that somebody

1002
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:43,000
for Sean Connery?
I Dunno.

1003
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,550
I'll read this.
In early 1954,

1004
00:43:45,551 --> 00:43:50,551
Ian Fleming was paid a thousand dollars 
for the television rights to Casino 

1005
00:43:50,551 --> 00:43:50,551
Royale.
Oh,

1006
00:43:50,551 --> 00:43:55,311
is a TV show.
It was adapted into an hour long TV 

1007
00:43:55,311 --> 00:43:58,651
special and was broadcast on CBS October
21st 1954 as an episode of climax 

1008
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,150
mystery theater.
They didn't even know.

1009
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,360
They didn't have climax back then.
Peter Lorre.

1010
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:09,340
What is that?
This is what you're talking about.

1011
00:44:09,341 --> 00:44:10,030
Oh,
this is it.

1012
00:44:10,031 --> 00:44:14,410
The TV show is the first episode,
I guess Linda Christian.

1013
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,530
Boy,
that was good stuff back then.

1014
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:25,990
Climax.
Look at it's all wiggly and shit.

1015
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,900
When they have the logo up,
it can't sit still.

1016
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:31,920
I feel like it moves.
Look at this guy.

1017
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,040
It doesn't look dangerous.
Not even in focus.

1018
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:39,100
That's killed plenty of men and women.
It's made beggars with many and 

1019
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,520
billionaires have a few mighty fueled in
French gambling casinos.

1020
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:46,120
This is called a shoe holds.
The cards were baccarat.

1021
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:51,230
Kings of gambling games,
and its purpose is to make sure that no 

1022
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,971
one can pull any funny business like 
dealing from the bottom game to be 

1023
00:44:54,971 --> 00:44:57,170
played tonight is for the highest stakes
of all.

1024
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:02,470
A man is going to wager his life.
Climax Presents Casino Royale on the 

1025
00:45:02,841 --> 00:45:06,480
best seller by Ian Fleming.
Stars Barry Nelson.

1026
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,290
Pull him out while he's doing this.
Linda Christian,

1027
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,430
throwing them on the ground and it's so 
funny that all intro to a show.

1028
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,410
He's cool,
man.

1029
00:45:15,411 --> 00:45:17,210
Look,
he's just throwing the cards away.

1030
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,500
What if there's like an old guy 
introducing like house?

1031
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:22,730
Look at this.
Act One,

1032
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:27,540
Casino Royale Act One.
Oh my God,

1033
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:29,850
this is so fake looking.
It's so weird.

1034
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,960
Gun Shot.
He missed him and then he hit the tree.

1035
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,570
Well they're really shooting that tree 
with the flux out about.

1036
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,720
Okay.
Stand on there.

1037
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,080
Whether it's shooting at the tree by 
winning he run,

1038
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:49,350
but I wouldn't to the ground.
You're lucky to Miss James Bond.

1039
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,210
Yup.
That's.

1040
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,910
See original James Bond.
Never catch him now.

1041
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,760
I'll never catch them now you bet guys.
Got a 10 step headstart.

1042
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,530
That's it.
I'll never catch up now.

1043
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:06,590
Come on.
People are so unathletic then you 

1044
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,600
imagine if you heard that kind of shit 
from um,

1045
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,450
what's his name?
Daniel Craig.

1046
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,500
No,
the other guy.

1047
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,750
Sean connery.
American guy.

1048
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:14,830
James Bond.
James Bourne.

1049
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:17,380
Identity Board.
It's a board.

1050
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,770
Imagine Jason Bourne said something like
that.

1051
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:24,990
Oh,
he's too far away now and move it in 

1052
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,891
right there.
So what kind of pussy am I paying money 

1053
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:28,140
to say it's just another movie where he 
just goes to eat lunch.

1054
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:34,310
There was another guy in 1956.
His name was Bob wholeness and Baba 

1055
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:39,500
wholeness provided the voice for James 
Bond in the South African radio 

1056
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,390
adaption.
So he was one of the James Bonds but not

1057
00:46:42,391 --> 00:46:47,391
a physical James Bond.
Then there was Bob Simmons and Bob 

1058
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,550
Simmons is apparently the guy

1059
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,640
that,
uh,

1060
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:54,200
that,
that

1061
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:56,890
stop doing it.
Right.

1062
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,250
Um,
or was it David Nivon?

1063
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,150
I'm not sure.
This was in the sixties whenever.

1064
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:05,280
Uh,
there was this one guy did one movie,

1065
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:08,430
George Lazenbys at him.
I'm not sure.

1066
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:14,130
Hmm.
I don't know which guy it is.

1067
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,240
It's either George Lazenby or David 
Niven.

1068
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,430
I would imagine it would be lazy and be 
for some reason.

1069
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:30,730
What are the most interesting things 
about the documentary is a in the 

1070
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:30,730
eighties,

1071
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:35,990
but all the,
all the James Bond movies are done by 

1072
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:35,990
one family.
Really?

1073
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:36,430
Yeah.
Except for one.

1074
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:42,180
And Sean Connery was friends with this 
outside director and they did a James 

1075
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:48,880
Bond movie in the eighties and it came 
out the same time as a Roger Moore James

1076
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,880
Bond movie.
This I didn't know came out like the 

1077
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,450
same week to James Bond movies.

1078
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:57,560
Two different.
James Bond's wow.

1079
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:02,830
Yeah.
It was lazy and be lazy and B was the 

1080
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,531
only guy that only played it once,
but it doesn't say anything in his 

1081
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:08,981
wikipedia about that just says,
I guess it's just not that important to 

1082
00:48:09,131 --> 00:48:11,810
some people that they put it in 
wikipedia.

1083
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:14,310
Interesting,
man.

1084
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,510
Yeah,
it's fascinating too,

1085
00:48:15,511 --> 00:48:15,770
man.

1086
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:17,000
Yeah.

1087
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,000
Oh,
okay.

1088
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:19,840
Here it is.

1089
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:21,980
Yeah.

1090
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:23,990
I guess,
uh,

1091
00:48:23,991 --> 00:48:25,010
yeah,
there was some,

1092
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:30,250
some issues.
I'm fascinated with different actors 

1093
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,131
playing the same character,
especially when it's supposed to be 

1094
00:48:33,131 --> 00:48:33,710
seamless.
How about the Hulk in modern times?

1095
00:48:33,711 --> 00:48:35,760
How many hawks or they've been.
There's been,

1096
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,530
there's been three in modern times.
Has Been Eric Bana.

1097
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:43,280
And then there was a homeboy from 
American history x.

1098
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:45,070
what's his name?
Uh,

1099
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,580
Norton.
Ed Norton.

1100
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,470
Yeah.
And then there's the new guy.

1101
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,150
Mark ruffled lows.
Oh,

1102
00:48:50,151 --> 00:48:50,510
is he?
Oh,

1103
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:52,890
he's the best dog ever.
Well,

1104
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,940
how dare you tell her.
He's fantastic.

1105
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:57,230
Oh,
you wouldn't like him when he's angry,

1106
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,930
dude.
The secret is he's always angry.

1107
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,930
That's the secret.
He says that,

1108
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:04,010
and he turns into the hulk smashing 
shit.

1109
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:07,460
He's the best hole cover.
The hulk is the best luck ever now.

1110
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,650
And he's the best hook ever.
He's the best banner.

1111
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,920
Okay.
Did you know that the original banners 

1112
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:14,920
name was Bruce?

1113
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,340
And then for TV they changed David 
Bruce's gaze.

1114
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:21,360
Fuck yeah.
And that hilarious in the days when that

1115
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:24,590
was out.
Yeah.

1116
00:49:24,591 --> 00:49:26,690
I guess that was the seventies.
Like when was the hawk?

1117
00:49:26,691 --> 00:49:29,510
Was it the seventies and the eighties?
Late Seventies.

1118
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:30,890
I remember watching it.
Yeah.

1119
00:49:30,891 --> 00:49:35,300
So in those days Bruce was associated 
with gay men.

1120
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,370
Like it was a joke.
Oh look,

1121
00:49:37,371 --> 00:49:38,980
here comes bruce.
No Kid.

1122
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,540
Yeah,
yeah,

1123
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:40,610
yeah.
If you were,

1124
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:42,560
if you were gonna,
call someone gay,

1125
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,230
he'd say is his name Bruce.
That's crazy.

1126
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,480
Yeah.
Bruce Lee.

1127
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:49,970
Right?
It's one of those manly guys ever.

1128
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,800
One of the baddest motherfuckers of all 
time was a bruce springsteen.

1129
00:49:54,801 --> 00:49:56,270
What about that?
Come on,

1130
00:49:56,271 --> 00:49:57,500
bitch.
That's manly shit.

1131
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,090
Right?
You can have.

1132
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,280
Can have gender.
We didn't know there's all yours.

1133
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,940
You get your Adam's apple trimmed out.
You're out of the book.

1134
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,800
That is like actually happening.
Right?

1135
00:50:06,801 --> 00:50:08,960
He's a,
he's getting very feminine.

1136
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,700
Allegedly.
He's getting very feminine.

1137
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,380
Allegedly.
He's getting it.

1138
00:50:12,381 --> 00:50:14,870
He didn't like his Adam's apple.
So he had some shit done to it,

1139
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:19,871
but who knows.
It could have been the reality might've 

1140
00:50:19,871 --> 00:50:22,120
been,
might had something wrong with his 

1141
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,981
voice,
might have something wrong with his 

1142
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:25,451
neck.
Could they be assholes just insinuating 

1143
00:50:25,451 --> 00:50:25,640
that he was becoming a woman.
I didn't.

1144
00:50:25,641 --> 00:50:30,641
I didn't say.
However we got Lee and Bruce 

1145
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:30,641
springsteen.
That's all I'm saying.

1146
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:33,350
I mean gender was a bad motherfucker for
like one weekend in the sixties.

1147
00:50:33,351 --> 00:50:38,351
He was Olympics wherever it was.
He might've just had a gross neck bone 

1148
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:39,630
or to like some of those people have 
those little neck things going on.

1149
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,360
It's disgusting.
It's true.

1150
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,120
That's like that's an issue with a lot 
of older folks.

1151
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:47,060
Their next get really creepy.
He's not a young guy.

1152
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,620
They do.
They get creepy.

1153
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,440
Like you look at their face and you 
don't mind looking at their face at all.

1154
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,160
Like you know you have a pleasant face.
Sure.

1155
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,470
They see their neck balls.
This is going to end terribly.

1156
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,020
Then you realize,
oh for all of us,

1157
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,900
everyone's going to get that Turkey neck
one day.

1158
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,200
If you're lucky,
if you're lucky to stay alive long 

1159
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:08,210
enough for your skin to have a bad 
relationship with your face,

1160
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:12,290
just slowly but surely.
Speaking of that,

1161
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:17,291
I did this cryo chamber thing today and 
we were talking about it before the 

1162
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:18,020
podcast that I polished tweets up.
Uh,

1163
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:23,021
Eddie Bravo told me about this and I've 
read about it online and I had a Ian 

1164
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,350
Mccall who's a fighter in the UFC,
one of the top flyweight contenders.

1165
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,300
He does it every day.
So I was like,

1166
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:30,620
okay,
I've heard too much about this.

1167
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:35,621
I got to give this a try.
So I went to this place called the Cryo 

1168
00:51:35,621 --> 00:51:39,200
health center in.
I'm in La today and go into this.

1169
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,850
It's like sort of like a suntanning 
booth I guess I got.

1170
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:43,760
Or a sauna?
Yeah,

1171
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:48,761
like a song,
like a big metal sauna and it's 240 

1172
00:51:49,371 --> 00:51:54,371
degrees below zero in there.
And you go in there for two minutes 

1173
00:51:54,371 --> 00:51:58,691
naked at 240 degrees below zero.
I got a hard on.

1174
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,260
Um,
I very hard.

1175
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:02,330
Really?
No,

1176
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:08,840
it's hard to breathe.
It's one of the strange feelings ever.

1177
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:09,710
How long,
how long?

1178
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,130
Only two minutes.
I looked at.

1179
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:15,920
That's me and they're two minutes minus 
two forties,

1180
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,540
240 degrees below zero.
It's weird how cold that feels and if as

1181
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:22,100
long as you only do it for a couple 
minutes,

1182
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:27,101
it's actually really good for your body.
You feel your eyes getting frozen or 

1183
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:27,101
anything?
No.

1184
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:28,130
That's a weird thing about eyes,
man.

1185
00:52:28,131 --> 00:52:33,131
We've talked about this before.
We talked about why don't your eyes get 

1186
00:52:33,131 --> 00:52:33,131
cold when it gets really cold out.

1187
00:52:33,131 --> 00:52:37,270
It's really weird.
Like the wind can whip into your eyes 

1188
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:37,270
and it hurts,
you know,

1189
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:38,140
and that can be cold because that's 
like.

1190
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,940
It's like the physical act of something 
like that.

1191
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:44,360
The actual Ehr itself smacking into 
your.

1192
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,540
Your eyeballs.
That can hurt but regular cold.

1193
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,240
Unless it gets really,
really fucking cold.

1194
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:53,390
Your eyes don't get cold.
Oh my eyes weren't called.

1195
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,940
The most noticeable thing wasn't just 
that.

1196
00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:58,460
My skin was really cold,
but it was hard to breathe.

1197
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:04,120
It's so cold.
Everything constricts you standing there

1198
00:53:05,271 --> 00:53:06,890
naked.
How safe is this?

1199
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,000
Safe is fuck.
Really.

1200
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,620
Don't be a pussy.
Get in there.

1201
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:15,190
Seems safe.
It looks like a super easy to open up 

1202
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:15,830
the door lock champs.
Is there a lock on the door?

1203
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:21,390
Well,
only if someone really doesn't like you 

1204
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:21,390
definitely die.
That's one thing.

1205
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:23,330
Someone locked you in there.
You're if you're naked.

1206
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:28,410
Yeah.
I don't know how long you're going to 

1207
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:29,481
laugh,
but what if that locked just stopped 

1208
00:53:29,481 --> 00:53:29,481
working.
He never locked.

1209
00:53:29,481 --> 00:53:30,410
They can't have a swinging door.
Just opened the door.

1210
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,350
It's not hard.
It's thick as fuck though.

1211
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,130
Be Hard to claw your way out of that in 
time.

1212
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,910
Don't.
Don't get in this booth if you're in.

1213
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:40,770
If you're in a fraternity or something 
for eternity,

1214
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,100
like eight other frat bro Brothers would
fucking hold the door.

1215
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,490
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1216
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:47,480
yeah.
We used them.

1217
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,220
Or at least you'd have horrible 
frostbite where they have to remove like

1218
00:53:53,221 --> 00:53:55,280
half the skin of your back.
You know,

1219
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,730
like.
Sorry Bro.

1220
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:59,190
He listened to your five Beta Kappa for 
life.

1221
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,400
There's no more haze and you gotta pass 
where the senior Tattoo already.

1222
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,240
Okay.
We've decided.

1223
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:13,830
We all voted on it.
We all voted in assholes.

1224
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:18,210
I was never joined one pass by Frat the 
other day.

1225
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:23,310
It was all these dudes were in front of 
the house and they were playing 

1226
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:23,310
football,
playing catch,

1227
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:27,921
like on the lawn and there was like a 
bunch of them in there drinking beers 

1228
00:54:27,921 --> 00:54:30,441
like this is so like stereotypical,
like did you guys like see a movie and 

1229
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:35,601
you decided to go to school,
do everything that they did in the 

1230
00:54:35,601 --> 00:54:35,601
movies.
Wacky Frat guys?

1231
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:38,340
No.
You said it's pretty funny.

1232
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:39,420
It's all about that.
Also,

1233
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:44,510
you know,
like people hanging out in the front 

1234
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:47,061
porch and drinking and having parties.
But living next to that with your 

1235
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:47,061
family,

1236
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:51,190
did you see the reactions that a seth 
rogen got by some wacky feminist?

1237
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,360
Um,
when it came to,

1238
00:54:53,361 --> 00:54:58,361
uh,
that guy that was shooting people up at 

1239
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,840
Santa Barbara know what happened?
She was this woman,

1240
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:00,710
well,
you know,

1241
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:02,240
the guy was shot at the epicenter,
Barbara.

1242
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:07,270
Well,
this woman somehow or another implied 

1243
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:07,880
that it's cartoonish depictions of 
women,

1244
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:13,330
like in Seth Rogan's movies that lead 
men to have these horrific ideas of what

1245
00:55:14,691 --> 00:55:17,390
women really are.
And then like somehow or another lead to

1246
00:55:17,391 --> 00:55:21,410
them killing them.
Especially in that one story.

1247
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:26,440
It's a terrible,
it's terrible connection because he 

1248
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:26,660
killed men to killed more men,
in fact,

1249
00:55:26,661 --> 00:55:29,000
and he killed women.
He killed four men and women.

1250
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:29,510
Right?
I mean,

1251
00:55:29,511 --> 00:55:31,290
he was just a sick fuck.
Yeah.

1252
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:32,690
You know,
the kid was a mess.

1253
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:37,840
But the idea that somehow or another 
seth Rogan's movies like have to be 

1254
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,170
gender balanced,
you know,

1255
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,170
and at the sacrifice of what,
of comedy.

1256
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:45,060
Like they can't be caricaturists,
they can't,

1257
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:50,270
whoever's in the film that it can't be a
woman with long nails is really done as 

1258
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:50,990
big tests.
If that happens,

1259
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,350
a guy's going to murder people.
Right.

1260
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,680
And what about actual cartoons?
Like,

1261
00:55:54,681 --> 00:55:59,681
don't you know what I mean?
There's all those crazy depictions in 

1262
00:55:59,681 --> 00:55:59,681
that.
If you heard about his new movie,

1263
00:55:59,681 --> 00:56:00,350
it's about North Korea.

1264
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,380
Yeah.
And are they are already saying like,

1265
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:06,050
like this is a threat of war and if this
movie comes out that,

1266
00:56:06,051 --> 00:56:08,250
that they're threatening war on us 
because of this movie,

1267
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,560
they can't go to war with us.
That's ridiculous.

1268
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:15,680
For one movie,
for the new Seth rogen movie about 

1269
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,510
assassinating Kim Jong.
Oh,

1270
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:20,500
it's called a some.

1271
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:25,270
Could you imagine?
Could you imagine if North Korea goes to

1272
00:56:25,271 --> 00:56:27,280
war and as for a fucking James Franco 
movie,

1273
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:29,730
we'll be like,
we don't like them either.

1274
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:33,300
Not going to kill him.
Just troll them on instagram.

1275
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,980
You don't have to.
You don't have to do this.

1276
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,270
You have to go to.
Should have went to war over the south.

1277
00:56:38,271 --> 00:56:40,580
But that South Park movie team America.
Yeah,

1278
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:45,610
that was way worse.
That was when they drew the line in the 

1279
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:45,610
sand though.
That was great.

1280
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,540
That was the first blow.
Then like one more time.

1281
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:49,490
Mother fuckers.
One more time.

1282
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:51,320
They're always threatening war though,
aren't they?

1283
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:54,290
I don't know.
I think they really get the mic.

1284
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:56,840
Rib doesn't come back this week.
We're going to war with you.

1285
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,460
While they're very hurting.
They don't have much money.

1286
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:01,980
They say when you fly over North Korea 
at night,

1287
00:57:01,981 --> 00:57:04,050
it's all dark because they can't afford 
to keep the lights on.

1288
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,420
Wow.
It's not a good place.

1289
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:11,900
I don't want to go.
We had Shane Smith from vice and he 

1290
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:11,900
talked about his vet,
his visits to North Korea.

1291
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:16,820
He said it was the craziest thing ever.
Like they pretended that they took him 

1292
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:16,820
to a restaurant,
it was all set up,

1293
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:21,231
but there was no one else there with him
and he said it was so obvious that by 

1294
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:21,231
the way,
that people move,

1295
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:25,791
they didn't move with like,
like people who are comfortable working 

1296
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:25,791
there.
It was like,

1297
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:26,310
it was all totally new experience for 
them.

1298
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:31,550
So they probably were people that were 
like forced into this position to 

1299
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:32,430
pretend that it was a restaurant for 
American journalists.

1300
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,170
Right.
And he's going,

1301
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,140
whoa.
And then he got Dennis Rodman going over

1302
00:57:37,141 --> 00:57:41,430
there playing basketball and grab ass 
with a fucking kid than the kid winds up

1303
00:57:41,431 --> 00:57:43,350
being the new dictator now.
Right.

1304
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:49,690
I miss the.
I Miss Dennis Rodman being on TV every 

1305
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:52,240
day.
He could be on tv every day if someone 

1306
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:52,240
was smart.
Yeah.

1307
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:52,790
Just follow them with the camera.
How's that gone on?

1308
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:56,360
Every reality show he should.
A good reality show producer.

1309
00:57:56,510 --> 00:58:00,950
You're telling me you can produce a TV 
show about a slippery road,

1310
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:06,970
but you can't produce a TV show about a 
giant black man with facial piercings 

1311
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:09,530
that likes to get drunk or crazy.
Wait a minute.

1312
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:12,950
He's a celebrity.
He plays basketball with murderers.

1313
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:18,100
Yeah.
He plays basketball with the guy who 

1314
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:18,100
killed his own family.
Okay.

1315
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:22,240
The guy killed his own family because he
was worried that they were going to 

1316
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,780
assassinate him.
He goes over there and plays basketball.

1317
00:58:23,781 --> 00:58:25,580
With that.
You can make a show in Kaiser,

1318
00:58:25,581 --> 00:58:30,581
so.
So you can make a show about dudes who 

1319
00:58:30,581 --> 00:58:30,760
hunt alligators or swamp people.
There's something.

1320
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,710
It's like dudes giving away parking 
tickets as a show.

1321
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:36,560
Exactly.
They have a guy makes pools.

1322
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,390
A guy makes pools.
He's the pool master on the next episode

1323
00:58:41,391 --> 00:58:43,040
of Crochet.
Yeah.

1324
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:46,760
What the fuck that he crochets a sheet 
they not have.

1325
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,730
How does ask Robin?
None of the show.

1326
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:50,420
Why don't I produce it?
What am I doing?

1327
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:55,680
You should.
I should be the Ryan seacrest of the 

1328
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,840
Dennis Rodman shows.
That's how he got started with this 

1329
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,991
whole Kim Kardashians thing.
Come in and introduce it like an old 

1330
00:59:01,991 --> 00:59:03,590
James Bond TV show.
Is Ryan seacrest embed with Satan or did

1331
00:59:03,591 --> 00:59:05,180
you just know?
What do you think?

1332
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,280
Spawn.
I think he's in bed with them.

1333
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:10,700
Let me think about what is a part of.
It's not star search.

1334
00:59:10,701 --> 00:59:11,740
American idol.
Yeah.

1335
00:59:11,741 --> 00:59:16,741
That's part of American idol.
It's part of a keeping up with the 

1336
00:59:16,741 --> 00:59:19,331
Kardashians and during that time he has 
time to be the host of top 40 radio 

1337
00:59:19,331 --> 00:59:19,930
every morning.
Yeah.

1338
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,260
What does he do on the.
I never watched that show producer

1339
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:22,910
of it.
Oh,

1340
00:59:22,911 --> 00:59:23,600
okay.
Okay.

1341
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:27,170
You created it.
He's on the radio every morning.

1342
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,900
He gets it.
How's the on the radio every morning?

1343
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:32,630
I don't do that at the time.
A lot of people.

1344
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:35,200
That means a lot of people like him.
Oh yeah.

1345
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:39,710
He's very likable or maybe this.
A lot of people don't hate him.

1346
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,150
I think that's more like it.
Right?

1347
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:42,240
There's a lot of that.
Go.

1348
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,870
Don't know who the fuck he goes.
Do you know who the fuck is?

1349
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:50,080
Barely.
I barely know you and I know you're 

1350
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:50,080
pretty good,
right?

1351
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,040
Not have fucking dude.
Do you know that dude?

1352
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,660
No.
I don't know anything,

1353
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,810
any of his opinions or anything like I 
know certain dudes.

1354
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:02,080
Right.
I feel like if you got had a couple of 

1355
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:02,080
drinks with val kilmer,
you pretty much know what's up.

1356
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:02,330
Right,
right.

1357
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,100
He'd be testing the bounds of reality.

1358
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:09,520
Yeah.
He'd probably throw some mushrooms down 

1359
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:09,520
the hatch and go walk through the 
parking lot.

1360
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:09,520
You'd be like,
vow,

1361
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:09,800
come on man.
We gotta get Outta here.

1362
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,630
Babysitting val kilmer like one every 
night.

1363
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:16,520
Someone's got to babysit him.
That's how it is.

1364
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,710
Hang out with val.
You gotta.

1365
01:00:18,711 --> 01:00:21,460
Make sure he makes it home.
You never know what he's going to pop.

1366
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:23,360
Pop and trip.
Yeah.

1367
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:28,630
That's a dude that like used to be like 
one of the biggest sex symbols in the 

1368
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:28,630
country.
Absolutely.

1369
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:30,350
And then he just decided to just keep 
eating.

1370
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,300
Yeah,
just totally tapped out.

1371
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,520
Just done.
I'm done.

1372
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,290
He used to be the iceman.
I'm going to get big.

1373
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:36,950
Yeah.
He's like,

1374
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:37,730
fuck it.
I got.

1375
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,330
I'm fine with this.
He,

1376
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,450
yeah,
he was a.

1377
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,550
wasn't he like a superhero?
What's that?

1378
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,630
Saint.
The saint.

1379
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,620
Yeah.
He was a superhero.

1380
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,250
He was the saint.

1381
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:51,410
Yeah.
And he always put shit fucking 

1382
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:51,470
superheroes that.
But all the superheroes,

1383
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:52,670
you know?
Yeah.

1384
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:56,240
I don't know that one that well.
Did he not see the watchmen?

1385
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,440
Did you not read Spiderman?
How come you get to be the same?

1386
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:05,950
Yeah.
I don't know quite why gets to be Peter 

1387
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:05,950
Parker and you've got to be the fucking 
saint.

1388
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:09,850
No,
that's some bullshit bad deal with that 

1389
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:09,850
is bull shit.
He did.

1390
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:11,600
He did play Jim Morrison and the doors.
Right?

1391
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,610
That's where he cooked his brain and he 
cooked it.

1392
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:18,611
He's like,
he got in touch with his fat side in 

1393
01:01:18,611 --> 01:01:18,611
that movie.
Like he used to be a thin dude,

1394
01:01:18,611 --> 01:01:23,111
but then he played the 27 year old Jim 
Morrison and got his gut all all amped 

1395
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:28,481
out.
You ever doubt ever in your life that 

1396
01:01:28,481 --> 01:01:30,440
Val kilmer was a bad motherfucker?
You got to watch that movie.

1397
01:01:30,441 --> 01:01:32,150
Tombstone.
Yeah.

1398
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:32,780
Yeah,
yeah.

1399
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:37,810
Oh my goodness.
He puts on a command performance in 

1400
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:38,510
tombstone.
You ever seen top secret?

1401
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,430
Yes.
That's funny.

1402
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:41,330
Shit.
No,

1403
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:42,230
it's not.
It's not.

1404
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,000
I tried it and seen as the dad.
I need that.

1405
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:46,820
You think it's funny because when I was 
a kid,

1406
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:52,210
I was such a fan of naked gun and I 
tried to watch all those movies like 

1407
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:53,210
Kentucky Fried Movie Top secret.
Oh,

1408
01:01:53,211 --> 01:01:58,211
that's hilarious.
They all just did not live up to the 

1409
01:01:58,211 --> 01:01:58,211
naked gun.
Oh,

1410
01:01:58,211 --> 01:01:58,610
well,
what was the movie?

1411
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,100
What was the TV show that started naked 
gun?

1412
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,820
A police files or something?
Police squad and police squad.

1413
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,320
Ninety three.
Wow.

1414
01:02:06,321 --> 01:02:11,321
Tombstone was 21 fucking years ago.
That's so crazy.

1415
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:17,830
And when there another movie about a doc
holiday and all those guys that came out

1416
01:02:18,381 --> 01:02:20,110
at the same time,
you're

1417
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,280
too close to it,
close to it,

1418
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,790
but it was,
uh,

1419
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,390
a little later.
And who was in it?

1420
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:31,290
I want to say Kevin Costner.
I think so.

1421
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,440
Yeah.
But tombstone was the good one with the 

1422
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:36,440
I'm your huckleberry and all that shit.
Here.

1423
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,800
You Bitch.
Unforgiven no wrong.

1424
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:42,970
And a dare you.
How dare you confuse Kevin Costner and 

1425
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:47,610
clinics would go back to Ohio.
You know,

1426
01:02:47,611 --> 01:02:50,190
Kevin Costner Played Wyatt earp,
right?

1427
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,080
I think someone else played someone 
like,

1428
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,800
who else played it?
Kurt Russell was in there somewhere.

1429
01:02:58,801 --> 01:03:03,801
Maybe that's very confusing because I've
only seen tombstone Wyatt earp,

1430
01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:07,590
the movie,
let's see why it was good,

1431
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,400
but it was weird because they had to,
um,

1432
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:16,760
put Kevin Costner and some weird wig to 
make them look like he was a kid and 

1433
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,250
then they took the wig off when he was 
younger and you're like,

1434
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,360
wait,
when he was older,

1435
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:19,500
like,
wait a minute,

1436
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,900
I was more of a young guns guy.

1437
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,710
Young guns was fun.
Young guns was fun.

1438
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,300
It was 94.
So it was a year later.

1439
01:03:27,301 --> 01:03:32,301
Yeah.
So it was Kevin Costner and Dennis 

1440
01:03:32,301 --> 01:03:33,030
Quaid.
Dennis Quaid Played Doc holiday.

1441
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:38,510
He did a good job with doc holiday too.
But I remember this one dude who was an 

1442
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:40,230
actor.
I was trying to tell him,

1443
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,340
I saw the movie,
I saw a tombstone.

1444
01:03:44,341 --> 01:03:47,220
I was talking about how good val kilmer 
was as doc holiday.

1445
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:48,900
I was like,
that dude was creepy.

1446
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:49,620
Good in that movie.
He's like,

1447
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:51,320
I disagree.
I thought it was.

1448
01:03:51,321 --> 01:03:53,580
Performance is a little over the top.
Um,

1449
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:55,470
you know,
Dennis Quaid I thought did a much better

1450
01:03:55,471 --> 01:03:56,430
job in the Ra.
And I'm like,

1451
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:58,230
no,
you don't go.

1452
01:03:58,231 --> 01:04:01,620
You don't think he just saw you saw him 
do it.

1453
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:06,621
You saw what Val kilmer did and you knew
that you can't do that and it bothers 

1454
01:04:06,621 --> 01:04:08,820
the shit out of you because you're a 
mediocre sitcom actor.

1455
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,880
Yeah.
So you're all angry that Dennis Quaid 

1456
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,810
you like Dennis Quaid your hero.
Now you're going to let you go.

1457
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,470
Because why?
Because Dennis Quaid did it.

1458
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,860
It was.
It wasn't the same kind of performance.

1459
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:20,610
That's a good job.
He did a good job.

1460
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:25,560
But Val kilmer hit that creepy spot.
He hit that creepy spot where you really

1461
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:30,561
believe he was a gunfighter.
You really believed that he had some 

1462
01:04:30,561 --> 01:04:33,270
lightning reflex and he had killed 100 
men with his gun when he was like,

1463
01:04:33,271 --> 01:04:36,330
I'm your huckleberry and he's got this 
dead look in his eyes.

1464
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:41,450
He,
that dude knew he couldn't hit that 

1465
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:41,450
spot.
Right?

1466
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:44,751
And so he's like,
I thought it was performance was very 

1467
01:04:44,751 --> 01:04:46,671
over the top,
the fuck you did over the top of my 

1468
01:04:46,671 --> 01:04:46,671
ability.
Yeah,

1469
01:04:46,671 --> 01:04:50,721
exactly.
You just feel like shit when you watch 

1470
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:50,721
it.
Yeah.

1471
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:52,950
So you try to diminish your hater,
hater face.

1472
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:54,140
Okay.
The company Hookers,

1473
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,850
do you think they had filming this?
None.

1474
01:04:55,900 --> 01:05:00,900
They're all kissing each other.
They'll fucking oil up after every show 

1475
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,150
around.
Smooched.

1476
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,370
Charlie Sheen,
small mouth there.

1477
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:08,000
Who are the lesser known guys?
Are they still working?

1478
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,810
Isn't this Dr Mcdreamy or whatever his 
name is?

1479
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,220
Really?
Oh no,

1480
01:05:13,221 --> 01:05:15,320
that one's not.
Is one of the other ones.

1481
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:20,470
Well,
why don't you find that the guy all the 

1482
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:20,470
way on the

1483
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:20,470
right looks kind of familiar.
Here we go.

1484
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:23,350
It's a million Esteban's.
Keep yourself and Lou diamond.

1485
01:05:23,351 --> 01:05:24,460
Phillips.
Charlie Sheen,

1486

dermopathy,

Mulroney and Casey size.
None of those guys is Dr Mcdreamy.

1488
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,560
Dr Mcdreamy.
That's women porn boy.

1489

1494
01:05:47,261 --> 01:05:48,190
Right.
[inaudible].

1495
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,020
Patrick Dempsey.
Yeah,

1496
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,930
I met that dude once at the comedy 
store.

1497
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:53,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

1498
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:55,990
I got off.
I got off stage.

1499
01:05:55,991 --> 01:05:58,520
He's a nice guy.
Was a and uh,

1500
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:01,060
he was with a,
a date I guess.

1501
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,920
And um,
he's like,

1502
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:07,950
man,
you really let that a heckler get here 

1503
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:07,950
just like a,
you know,

1504
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:08,260
don't let them bother you that much.
So I said,

1505
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:09,130
what?
No,

1506
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:09,820
fuck him,
man,

1507
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:14,340
you got shut those people down.
She was giving me advice on how to,

1508
01:06:14,341 --> 01:06:15,970
uh,
interact with hecklers,

1509
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:16,840
not so dreamy.

1510
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,160
I was like,
listen dude,

1511
01:06:18,161 --> 01:06:23,161
you get up there and you tell you tell 
some jokes and have some drunk asshole 

1512
01:06:23,161 --> 01:06:25,270
Yell Shit at you in front of a packed 
house where you have to deal with that.

1513
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:27,190
Like you don't know what that is.
Yeah,

1514
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:29,740
you want to try it,
you go try it and then then tell me,

1515
01:06:29,741 --> 01:06:32,620
you know what it is.
But when someone's interrupting the flow

1516
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:37,621
of the show,
like screaming shit out like you're 

1517
01:06:37,621 --> 01:06:39,841
supposed to,
you have to deal with that and you got 

1518
01:06:39,841 --> 01:06:40,720
to deal with that.
And as a producer of a way as possible,

1519
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:43,450
you have to discourage that from ever 
happening again.

1520
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:45,580
And that's the only way to get comedy 
out of it.

1521
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:50,140
It's your job as a comedian to belittle 
and mock that person.

1522
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:51,940
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1523
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:55,540
It has to happen because the audience 
feels that the audience has pissed.

1524
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:57,580
You got a drunk eyes interrupting the 
show.

1525
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:59,920
It's almost always a guy,
but occasionally it's a check,

1526
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,430
but they're less aggressive now.
The chicks that do it,

1527
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:06,010
their heckles or very rarely like as out
and out.

1528
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,780
Douchey is the men hackles.
They're more clueless right now.

1529
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:13,890
Yeah.
They're not used to being told to be 

1530
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:13,890
quiet.

1531
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:18,480
No,
fuck you.

1532
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,410
Fuck you.
Fuck.

1533
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:22,720
You know,
in Boston I just let it happen.

1534
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:24,970
Just let them pass.
There's no win in that.

1535
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:27,220
You just Kinda have backup.
You have a lot of people with you.

1536
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:32,280
Yeah.
I have like eight guys standing behind 

1537
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:32,280
you.
Right?

1538
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,800
There's new club in Boston.
It just opened up like in the bottom of 

1539
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,561
a hotel.
It's one of those cool places where 

1540
01:07:37,561 --> 01:07:37,561
there the clubs in the hotel.
You just.

1541
01:07:37,561 --> 01:07:39,070
Joey did that.
He said that it's very good club,

1542
01:07:39,071 --> 01:07:40,750
but the sound system sucks.
Oh,

1543
01:07:40,751 --> 01:07:42,190
well that's,
that's the only.

1544
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:43,850
The most important part.
Yeah,

1545
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,320
and they don't want to hear about it 
apparently.

1546
01:07:45,321 --> 01:07:46,960
And people keep telling them the sound 
system sucks.

1547
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:51,961
They don't do anything about it.
They keep telling them through the 

1548
01:07:51,961 --> 01:07:51,961
sound,
so I think joey was like,

1549
01:07:51,961 --> 01:07:51,961
fuck it,
I'm done.

1550
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:53,740
But Joey could do the Wilbur theater 
now.

1551
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:55,210
Joe is gigantic now.

1552
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,740
Joe Is the man.
Yeah,

1553
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:59,050
he's too funny.
It's all working out.

1554
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:01,990
He likes doing comedy clubs.
We all like doing comedy clubs.

1555
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:07,050
But if joey wanted to,
if they didn't want to fix the sound 

1556
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:07,050
system,
he could easily do that.

1557
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:11,280
The Boston comedy scene used to have 
five clubs on one block and now they're 

1558
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,410
down to a theater and you know,
the outside rooms,

1559
01:08:14,411 --> 01:08:17,180
like the dicta already rooms.
He has a bunch of rooms.

1560
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,940
I'm sure there's other people that book 
rooms that I don't know about,

1561
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,520
but the Intel clubs,
it's like they're down dike.

1562
01:08:22,521 --> 01:08:25,650
I think nick's does it only on weekends 
and uh,

1563
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,590
then they have this new place.
That's it.

1564
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:33,130
Like the feet,
the scene just to the floor fell out of 

1565
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:33,130
it.

1566
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:33,420
How long did you,
you started in Boston,

1567
01:08:33,421 --> 01:08:34,080
right?
Yeah.

1568
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,220
And how many years were you there?

1569
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:41,640
Um,
I was back and forth the third and 

1570
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,611
fourth year.
So I only really lived there for like 

1571
01:08:44,611 --> 01:08:47,860
two and a half years while I was doing 
comedy.

1572
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,310
I may live there for longer.
I was born in New Jersey,

1573
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:56,730
lived in San Francisco to allow as an 11
or a cow in New Jersey till seven San 

1574
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,000
Francisco,
seven to 11,

1575
01:08:58,001 --> 01:08:59,320
Florida,
11 to 13.

1576
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:04,350
Boston 13 to like 24 ish.
That's when I moved to New York.

1577
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,310
I was going back and forth the first,
um,

1578
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,610
the first year I was doing a lot of,
it was hard to get gigs in New York.

1579
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:15,070
I was a new guy.
Road gigs especially.

1580
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:20,310
So I'd get road gigs in Connecticut.
I get some of them around Boston that 

1581
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:20,310
was like,
at least for the first,

1582
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:22,870
like six months or so.
But uh,

1583
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:28,200
it's uh,
it's fucking hard place now to make a,

1584
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:31,510
make a living as a comment.
That's not the same thing anymore.

1585
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:32,860
Yeah.
I've only,

1586
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:35,630
I've never played an actual club they're
doing,

1587
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:37,330
there's not that many.
There

1588
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:39,210
used to be amazing.
It was.

1589
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:39,940
I mean,
I wish I could,

1590
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I would.
I guess if I had realized how great it 

1591
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,280
was at the time of her,
I'd realized how,

1592
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:50,400
how special it was.
Maybe I wouldn't have enjoyed it as 

1593
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,611
much.
Maybe like half of me enjoying it was 

1594
01:09:53,611 --> 01:09:54,820
just being in the moment and then being 
able to look back on it and go,

1595
01:09:54,821 --> 01:09:56,260
wow,
how lucky did I get?

1596
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:58,690
Because I could've easily been somewhere
else.

1597
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:02,260
I could have easily been in Miami.
I could it be I'm as a kid.

1598
01:10:02,261 --> 01:10:04,660
It wasn't my choice that we moved to 
Boston.

1599
01:10:04,661 --> 01:10:09,661
I didn't have a say in it and the time 
that I came onto the scene in August of 

1600
01:10:09,661 --> 01:10:14,641
2000 or 1988 rather in August of 1988,
when I came on the scene,

1601
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:19,630
I was 21 years old and the place was 
just flooded with comedians.

1602
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:25,020
There was all these like big name guys 
were always in town.

1603
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:30,240
There was always like billy crystal 
would be in town and Robin Williams 

1604
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,410
would stop in and see these guys.
He had seen an hbo like Dom,

1605
01:10:33,411 --> 01:10:38,411
I rera was in town.
All these guys were in town and there 

1606
01:10:38,411 --> 01:10:40,930
was a constant tour of like top level 
talent that would come through Boston.

1607
01:10:40,931 --> 01:10:43,900
Like Hicks came through Boston Kennison 
would come through Boston,

1608
01:10:43,901 --> 01:10:45,700
but he would do like theaters like down 
the Cape,

1609
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:49,780
so we'd go to the theaters and shit like
that and we saw them in Mansfield too,

1610
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:52,930
but it was just an incredible time for 
comedy,

1611
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:58,200
like the greatest time ever to start,
but I think now it's getting pretty 

1612
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,711
close to that.
I think now might be out of all of the 

1613
01:11:01,711 --> 01:11:03,130
years that I've been doing comedy,
there's more strong comedians now than I

1614
01:11:03,131 --> 01:11:03,730
think ever.

1615
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:08,790
There's a lot because everyone knows 
what everyone's up to on the Internet 

1616
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:12,340
and everyone is swinging for the fences 
like everyone's really developed.

1617
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:13,980
Yeah,
and I think

1618
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,830
it's also easier for guys to get gigs 
because they can get gay.

1619
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:23,990
People can find out that you're funny 
because of online you can get a 

1620
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:23,990
developer,
you can get a podcast,

1621
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:29,030
develop a following,
and then start doing well in clubs and 

1622
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:32,751
people will come out to see you like way
easier than it would be to get a 

1623
01:11:32,751 --> 01:11:36,861
television show which would give these 
sort of the same kind of following when 

1624
01:11:37,171 --> 01:11:40,710
you would go to clubs that that's what 
you had to rely on 20 years ago.

1625
01:11:40,711 --> 01:11:45,711
Somebody will pick you to do something.
Now all you have to do is release your 

1626
01:11:45,711 --> 01:11:46,310
CD online for free.
You know,

1627
01:11:46,311 --> 01:11:51,311
let everybody hear it.
People downloaded and they laugh and 

1628
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:51,311
then they find out that you're going to 
be at a club next week.

1629
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:52,870
I'll go see that guy.
He's hilarious.

1630
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,600
And then boom,
you know,

1631
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:58,640
and then you put little videos.
Go out little this little that a podcast

1632
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:00,780
or did it today,
the full tron show.

1633
01:12:00,781 --> 01:12:02,370
Everybody knows who the fuck you are.
You know,

1634
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:06,180
I love when networks out because it's 
such a shitty process.

1635
01:12:06,181 --> 01:12:08,820
Everyone going through two or three 
channels.

1636
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:14,150
We'll think about all the guys that we 
know now think about like Duncan Sigora,

1637
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:19,740
Ra d as all those guys are going through
nontraditional channels.

1638
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:24,830
They are and and I've known a lot of 
times it was like a Hollywood wasn't 

1639
01:12:24,901 --> 01:12:29,901
picking up on some of those guys 100 
percent and now they're like doing way 

1640
01:12:29,901 --> 01:12:34,311
better than a lot of guys that have tv 
spots once because their nightclub 

1641
01:12:34,311 --> 01:12:34,500
comics Hollywood's looking for

1642
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:39,680
like even our.
And I had a conversation about that 

1643
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,900
recently about what it was like when he 
first started out that he was always 

1644
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,710
worried that he wasn't doing something 
that was going to get them on TV.

1645
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,050
It was like it was,
was it a prison?

1646
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:49,080
You would worry about doing tv or make a
TV set?

1647
01:12:49,081 --> 01:12:50,550
I have,
I have to have a TV set.

1648
01:12:50,551 --> 01:12:52,980
I have to be able to do censored 
material.

1649
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:58,730
But he also knew that if he was 
uncensored and just himself and raw,

1650
01:12:58,891 --> 01:13:01,770
he could say hilarious shit and he could
kill.

1651
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,160
He knew that he had that in him.
Yeah,

1652
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,060
but it was like this struggle,
like how do you.

1653
01:13:06,061 --> 01:13:10,470
But how do you break through and make it
and then as he was developing,

1654
01:13:10,471 --> 01:13:13,350
right as he was developing the whole 
Internet thing came along.

1655
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,260
Yeah.
And he got into podcasts early,

1656
01:13:15,261 --> 01:13:15,590
I think

1657
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:17,140
real early.
Yeah.

1658
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:22,190
I mean that certainly helps,
but it's also just the amount of 

1659
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:25,741
material of his that's online now,
whether it's stand up or whether it's 

1660
01:13:25,741 --> 01:13:25,870
him talking about shit.

1661
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:29,380
He's got so much material now to like,
every time I see him he's doing like,

1662
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:34,470
like what we're talking about,
he's going up on stage and he's doing 

1663
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:34,470
like a different 15 on the first show in
a different.

1664
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:36,530
I'm talking about New York spots.
Uh,

1665
01:13:36,531 --> 01:13:38,530
he's always got like a.
he's got tons of material.

1666
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:38,900
Hard

1667
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:39,450
worker.
Yeah,

1668
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:40,370
for sure.
Our,

1669
01:13:40,371 --> 01:13:41,310
he works hard.
He,

1670
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:44,480
he gets things done.
He's a,

1671
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,570
he's motivated and also he's motivated 
because he's been,

1672
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:53,170
he's been on the other side.
He's been the guy who tried to become a 

1673
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:53,170
comedian and was really struggling and 
hating it.

1674
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:58,330
And now that he's making it,
now that he's doing well and making 

1675
01:13:58,330 --> 01:13:58,330
money,
he's really appreciating it.

1676
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

1677
01:13:59,080 --> 01:13:59,630
I,
it's like,

1678
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:05,110
I think what we're talking about,
like people that grow up in shitty 

1679
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:07,901
weather,
they're the ones who really appreciate 

1680
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:07,901
La.
Yeah.

1681
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:10,780
You know,
and I think that when you struggle as a 

1682
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,871
comic,
everybody wants to get on American or 

1683
01:14:13,871 --> 01:14:17,100
America's got talent like the first year
and start touring the nation and selling

1684
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:21,160
out theaters was doing comedy in a year 
and then I did mass square garden.

1685
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:22,320
It was amazing.
No,

1686
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:25,420
that's a nightmare.
You're going to die up there.

1687
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:26,410
You know,
I've looked.

1688
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,650
I've seen the bravest men ever.
And that's Charlie Murphy.

1689
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:34,830
Charlie Murphy's the bravest man ever 
when it comes to standup comedy because 

1690
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:38,791
Charlie Murphy was in his forties.
He had never done standup before and he 

1691
01:14:38,791 --> 01:14:40,690
was on a hit television show and when he
was on Chappelle show,

1692
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:42,820
he was telling these great stories and 
everybody's like,

1693
01:14:42,821 --> 01:14:44,290
Holy Shit,
I want to see that guy to do comedy.

1694
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:48,650
So they forced him into going and doing 
like he would host and do like do,

1695
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:53,730
do a little bit of time and then tell us
stories and people would laugh and then 

1696
01:14:53,730 --> 01:14:54,280
all of a sudden he realized he was a 
comedian.

1697
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:55,240
Like,
okay,

1698
01:14:55,241 --> 01:15:00,241
now I'm a standup comedian.
He's going on the road and he's fucking 

1699
01:15:00,241 --> 01:15:00,241
headlining.
Yeah.

1700
01:15:00,241 --> 01:15:00,730
Immediately,
immediately.

1701
01:15:00,731 --> 01:15:04,620
Forty five minutes a meat.
That is a long time.

1702
01:15:04,621 --> 01:15:07,120
Yeah.
That's so long.

1703
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:08,230
It's so hard to do.

1704
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:13,230
So many.
So many jumps you're going to have to 

1705
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:13,570
make to get to the top.
You're like,

1706
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,770
there's people,
there's a mountain in the.

1707
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:18,920
Most people are already like halfway up.
Right.

1708
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:20,920
And you don't even have any clothes on.
Right?

1709
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:22,270
You're going to try to do it out in the 
open.

1710
01:15:22,271 --> 01:15:25,740
You got to be exposed and you get to try
to run up the mountain quick,

1711
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:29,440
try to jump from base camp all the way 
to the top of the mountain.

1712
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:33,470
Dude's still in there swinging,
swinging.

1713
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:36,730
It's incredible.
He's the bravest man in standup comedy.

1714
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:42,090
I don't know.
A lot of people would have been able to 

1715
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:42,090
do that.
I couldn't.

1716
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:44,690
He's got balls and he's fucking a good 
dude,

1717
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:46,540
man.
He's a very good dude.

1718
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,370
Charlie Murphy.
He's a good dude.

1719
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:51,220
I really enjoy that guy.
Enjoys company joy.

1720
01:15:51,221 --> 01:15:52,930
Being around him.
He's always,

1721
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:54,790
always a fun guy to be around.

1722
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:57,190
He's a very friendly guy too.
If you get to know him,

1723
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:02,220
he's fucking hilarious.
I was with Maurice Smith and Ivan 

1724
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:06,301
salivary and Charlie Murphy is telling 
us I'm old school karate fight stories 

1725
01:16:06,301 --> 01:16:09,460
and we were dying laughing.
He was talking about hitting people with

1726
01:16:09,461 --> 01:16:14,461
Ridge hands.
It's a technique you don't see in ever 

1727
01:16:14,461 --> 01:16:17,131
made the bridge hand Chicago Ridge hand 
like I guess there's a Chicago Ridge 

1728
01:16:17,131 --> 01:16:21,871
hand.
It's a type of karate chop that comes 

1729
01:16:21,871 --> 01:16:24,331
from a specific angle,
but a lot of guys don't know about the 

1730
01:16:24,331 --> 01:16:28,350
Chicago Ridge hand.
So the Murphy brothers were doing 

1731
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:28,350
karate.
Charlie was.

1732
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:29,170
Charlie Murphy has a black belt,
I believe.

1733
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,230
No kidding.
Yeah,

1734
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,210
yeah,
yeah.

1735
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:32,920
He knows a lot about martial arts.
Tell you that.

1736
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,260
We had some conversations.
He knows a lot of shit.

1737
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:37,420
He fought in a lot of tournaments and 
stuff.

1738
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:39,690
He's kind of a bad ass dude.
None of that.

1739
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:44,740
Yeah.
Charlie Murphy is an interesting 

1740
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:44,740
character.
He's a very complex guy.

1741
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:46,180
He's got a lot going on in his head.
I mean,

1742
01:16:46,181 --> 01:16:49,300
those guys who tell good stories,
they're homeless always very complex.

1743
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:54,360
Right.
There's something about being that good 

1744
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:54,850
socially,
being that good of a storyteller,

1745
01:16:54,851 --> 01:16:57,280
that captivating,
that usually comes from a strange place.

1746
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:57,650
Right.

1747
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,370
It comes from Rick James.
I'm muddying up your couch.

1748
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,690
Yeah.
Did that happen to him or Eddie?

1749
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:06,910
That was the.
Both of them.

1750
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:07,840
Oh really?
Yeah,

1751
01:17:07,841 --> 01:17:12,841
they were both there.
That is just one of the best stories of 

1752
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:13,880
all time.
I had Rick James on a show.

1753
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:16,190
Uh,
I was doing this show for vh one,

1754
01:17:16,191 --> 01:17:19,500
I think it was,
was called the list and uh,

1755
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:22,670
I think that was the name of it and uh,
it was,

1756
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,090
um,
I had um,

1757
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:26,660
a bunch of people on that were like 
really famous,

1758
01:17:26,661 --> 01:17:31,661
like meatloaf was on one of my episodes 
and Tom Sizemore was on one of my 

1759
01:17:31,661 --> 01:17:33,830
episodes.
Got The leads.

1760
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:38,710
Rob Halford one tiffany from.
I think we're,

1761
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:40,340
yeah,
she was on one.

1762
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:42,970
Um,
and uh,

1763
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,240
that's hilarious.
Now that I'm thinking about that,

1764
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,600
what was it called?
It was called the list.

1765
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:53,270
Wow.
I totally forgot about that show.

1766
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:56,000
And what happens on this show.
I don't remember.

1767
01:17:57,730 --> 01:18:02,000
Some non memorable sort of a trivia 
show.

1768
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:04,370
I don't remember.
TRACI lords was on one of them.

1769
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:09,430
Nice.
TRACI lords post porn career when she 

1770
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:09,430
was legit actress.
Right.

1771
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:14,780
She'd become a religion actress,
but who was the original person that we 

1772
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:14,780
were talking about was on it.
Charlie Murphy.

1773
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:15,060
Charlie Murphy?
No,

1774
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,050
no.
Rick James.

1775
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,300
James.
Brick changes.

1776
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:20,240
That's what it was.
He was defending Michael Jackson who was

1777
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:25,670
one of the early Michael Jackson 
controversies obviously before he died,

1778
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:28,810
one of the earlier ones and Rick James 
was a,

1779
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,410
you know,
I know Michael.

1780
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:37,260
I never seen that and there's other 
woman was upset because she was a mother

1781
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:38,420
and she was like,
you know,

1782
01:18:38,421 --> 01:18:39,650
like as a mom,
like,

1783
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:42,530
that really freaks me out that he likes 
sleeping with kids.

1784
01:18:42,531 --> 01:18:44,180
Oh,
you ain't got to worry.

1785
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:49,510
He ain't doing nothing.
I know Michael for 20 years and Rick 

1786
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:50,540
James has something wrong with his 
voice.

1787
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:52,700
While he was there,
it was kind of fucked up.

1788
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:57,701
Like something was wrong with his voice 
and like had assistance with them and 

1789
01:18:57,701 --> 01:18:57,701
the assistants were,
oh,

1790
01:18:57,701 --> 01:18:59,190
he's just got,
he's got a bit of a cold cut,

1791
01:18:59,210 --> 01:18:59,900
a bit of A.
Yeah.

1792
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:04,901
And all I could think it's just.
See I could see him hitting that crack 

1793
01:19:04,901 --> 01:19:08,501
pipe dude who do freebasing all night 
and stumbling into that studio.

1794
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:17,080
He was a real rock star man.
He had a bunch of people taking care of 

1795
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:17,080
them.
I was there,

1796
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,830
bunch of people like cleaned him up and 
polished them off.

1797
01:19:18,831 --> 01:19:21,400
Like had people that were moving them 
around.

1798
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:23,210
We were the fourth,
and this was,

1799
01:19:23,211 --> 01:19:24,360
um,
I,

1800
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,200
I want to say this was before all the 
chappelle stuff.

1801
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:30,980
This was Rick James before.
I'm Rick James,

1802
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:31,700
Bitch,
you know,

1803
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:36,720
all that.
Which really sort of revitalized him 

1804
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:36,720
before his death.

1805
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:37,580
That probably killed him probably.
Yeah.

1806
01:19:37,581 --> 01:19:39,440
It's probably Chappelle's.
I'm Rick James,

1807
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,050
Bitch famous.
It become actually Rick James.

1808
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:45,290
Cocaine is a hell of a drug.
Can bump everywhere.

1809
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:50,320
Every time you're out,
all of a sudden it's like the seventies 

1810
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:50,320
all over again.
And you Rick James Again.

1811
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:52,550
And the coke starts flowing.
Yeah.

1812
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:57,290
Except if you don't got a young man's 
heart and he had a 67 year old son,

1813
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:01,160
he can't be smoking rocks with a 67 year
old heart.

1814
01:20:01,161 --> 01:20:04,750
No more cocaine,
no cocaine after 14 rule.

1815
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:10,600
You know,
like I wrote this on twitter the other 

1816
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:10,890
day that at certain point in time it 
becomes pathetic if you're drunk.

1817
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,140
Right?
But if you hang in there around 70,

1818
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,330
it gets cooler.
Right?

1819
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,510
Like if you saw an old dude and he's 
seven years old,

1820
01:20:18,511 --> 01:20:21,000
is a drunk on his front lawn,
he smoking a joint,

1821
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:22,290
he's got a bottle of whiskey in his 
hand.

1822
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:23,370
You're like,
what's up man?

1823
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:25,500
How you doing?
You want to give that guy a hug?

1824
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:28,380
You know?
But if he was 50,

1825
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:30,660
it's 50 and he's publicly drunk and 
like,

1826
01:20:30,661 --> 01:20:32,030
oh listen man,
maybe you,

1827
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:34,530
maybe you need to talk to your wife.
Sounds like you got a problem.

1828
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,820
Yeah.
You know you guys fight.

1829
01:20:35,821 --> 01:20:37,110
I'm sorry man.
I gotta go.

1830
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:39,870
I gotta go have a fucking bitch.
Man will tell you.

1831
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:42,390
What she said to me is I was just 
sending me,

1832
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,660
no matter if seven years,
she said to me,

1833
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,140
sir,
I hate to kick you off your own lawn,

1834
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:50,790
but you got to go inside.
Come on,

1835
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:51,810
Bro.
You 50 years old.

1836
01:20:51,811 --> 01:20:54,340
Shouldn't be drunk.
I like that.

1837
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:59,930
It's kind of like a war veteran,
like type vibe once you're past 70 and 

1838
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:00,630
drinking and smoking.
Yeah.

1839
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:02,970
I'm never going to tell a seven year old
guy to put away the cigarettes.

1840
01:21:02,971 --> 01:21:04,830
He's earned it,
but he's over.

1841
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,040
It's over anyway.
Yeah,

1842
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,390
just the last few days of the movie.
Just like your cigarettes.

1843
01:21:09,391 --> 01:21:11,880
Do whatever you gotta do.
Do it right.

1844
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:14,850
I think you're absolutely right.
Brian's hanging in there.

1845
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:16,780
He's like,
if I could just hang in there to 70,

1846
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:21,820
30 more years to the 70 people,
the people who really want to believe 

1847
01:21:22,201 --> 01:21:23,640
that cigarette smoking is okay.
They go,

1848
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:25,560
well,
it all depends on the gene.

1849
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:27,330
If you've got that gene,
you get the cancer,

1850
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:30,000
but none of my family has cancer.
You know?

1851
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:31,070
Knock on wood.

1852
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,520
Absolve ation.
Yeah.

1853
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:38,370
Not that many people have those jeans.
I don't know who does.

1854
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:43,790
I think some people just survive somehow
or another that is smoking your lungs 

1855
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:43,980
every day.
Yeah,

1856
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:47,340
it's a weird one.
It's a weird one,

1857
01:21:47,341 --> 01:21:52,341
man there.
I saw this thing the other day where 

1858
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:52,341
they were talking about,
um,

1859
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:56,330
the vape pens and they were like,
these are clearly being marketed to 

1860
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:56,330
children.
Look,

1861
01:21:56,540 --> 01:22:01,540
this says strawberry bubblegum flavored.
Clearly this is marketed towards 

1862
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:02,280
children.
And I was gone.

1863
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:04,290
I was watching that going,
what do you,

1864
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:08,160
what?
Who pays you pays you to say this?

1865
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,780
Well,
there's one way to look at it.

1866
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:12,570
One would look at is say,
well maybe they really are concerned,

1867
01:22:12,571 --> 01:22:14,190
but they're just dumb.
Right?

1868
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:15,050
You know,
and so they,

1869
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:19,980
this was being marketed towards children
or adults that liked the taste of candy.

1870
01:22:19,981 --> 01:22:22,860
Is that even possible?
Candy with your tobacco?

1871
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:25,110
I think it's pretty fucking possible 
isn't absolutely.

1872
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:30,260
So that's one.
Two clearly being marketed towards 

1873
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:30,260
children.
He magic.

1874
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:33,990
We saw a kid with a vape pen and some 
strawberry,

1875
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:38,991
bubblegum flavored tobacco.
There's not an adult in the world there 

1876
01:22:38,991 --> 01:22:38,991
will be like,
oh,

1877
01:22:38,991 --> 01:22:42,951
that's okay.
Strangers would like grab it out of his 

1878
01:22:42,951 --> 01:22:42,951
hand.
Will that apparently,

1879
01:22:42,951 --> 01:22:44,640
that is a thing with young kids though.
Really?

1880
01:22:44,641 --> 01:22:47,430
They liked the vapor pens.
Kids that are trying to quit smoking.

1881
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:49,830
Kids that started smoking at age 15 are 
fucked.

1882
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:51,450
Right.
That happens,

1883
01:22:51,451 --> 01:22:51,930
man.
No,

1884
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:52,890
absolutely.
It happens.

1885
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,620
I know someone whose kid is,
uh,

1886
01:22:54,621 --> 01:22:59,621
addicted to smoking and she's like 16 or
17 years old and they've tried to get 

1887
01:22:59,621 --> 01:23:00,450
her off.
They've done this thing.

1888
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,580
They've,
they took her to a rehab.

1889
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,070
They took her to a hypnosis.
She can't get off.

1890
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:05,850
Do you know if she

1891
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:09,220
started with regular cigarettes or 
electronic cigarettes?

1892
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:14,680
Regular cigarettes.
My brother was always just like smoking 

1893
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:14,910
cigarettes when he was a kid,
like 11,

1894
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:15,430
12.

1895
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:18,760
My sisters started at 14.
And diesel smoke?

1896
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:20,140
No,
she quit a while back,

1897
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:23,850
but she smoked for a long time.
It's fucking she equipment.

1898
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:25,690
She had kids when she was pregnant.
She quit.

1899
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,460
It's dangerous shit,
man.

1900
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,920
I mean,
it's amazing that someone would take you

1901
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:32,230
having a baby to quit.
But my friend,

1902
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:37,900
his mom,
he's got an older sister and his mom 

1903
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,061
quit smoking to have the older sister 
and then just smoke through the 

1904
01:23:40,061 --> 01:23:40,630
pregnancy with him.
She was like,

1905
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:41,240
ah,
fuck it.

1906
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:45,130
Oh my gosh.
He smoked for

1907
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:48,970
let's move to the pregnancy.
Even though she knew how to quit.

1908
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:50,980
Wow.
She's a nice lady.

1909
01:23:50,981 --> 01:23:52,540
I've met her.
That's an evil bitch,

1910
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:53,500
bro.
Chill might say.

1911
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:54,940
She's Nice Lady.
She cooked her kid.

1912
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:56,530
Yeah,
she cooked that kid.

1913
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:57,970
He's a.
he's a good friend of mine.

1914
01:23:58,030 --> 01:23:59,890
I'm sure that's probably what's wrong 
with me.

1915
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,550
My mom smoked while I was in the womb.
Yeah.

1916
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:03,430
Yeah.
She did something wrong.

1917
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:04,630
So good.

1918
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,430
Yeah.
Remember my friend's mom smoke?

1919
01:24:06,431 --> 01:24:06,640
No,
I,

1920
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:09,550
no one in my family smoked,
but my friend's mom smoked and she would

1921
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:14,551
drive us to like the bowling alley or 
whatever and it was just smoke in the 

1922
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:15,010
car.
I remember thinking as a kid,

1923
01:24:15,011 --> 01:24:16,570
like,
this is so gross.

1924
01:24:16,571 --> 01:24:18,710
I can't smell anything.
Separate.

1925
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:21,160
Smoke out the windows.
Rolled up.

1926
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:22,340
Cold Out.
Yeah.

1927
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,310
Cold Out.
And she's kind of smoking hack.

1928
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,690
Hack with the heat on him.
I'll fucking drive your kids around,

1929
01:24:28,691 --> 01:24:32,800
but I'm not going to keep the air clean.
Yeah.

1930
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:34,750
Well Greg Fitzsimmons is the best 
stories.

1931
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,470
His,
he lived in Boston and uh,

1932
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:39,810
he,
his parents were chain smokers.

1933
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:44,650
And so his mother and his father were 
both chain smokers and they were in this

1934
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:46,240
house,
like boxed in,

1935
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:47,950
I think at the time actually was in New 
York.

1936
01:24:47,951 --> 01:24:49,960
And then you said he lived in New York 
for awhile too.

1937
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,630
And uh,
he was just no air,

1938
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:54,340
you know,
it's in the winter.

1939
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:56,770
So the entire house was filled and he's 
got asthma all the time.

1940
01:24:57,070 --> 01:24:59,530
So I'll fucked up.
Dad died young of a heart attack.

1941
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:03,070
Dad didn't even make it to 60.
Just fuck.

1942
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:05,140
I'm using that one.
The light.

1943
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:07,370
Another one party rolling.
Yeah.

1944
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,360
Ooh.
Who's that guy?

1945
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:15,190
Keith Richards did happen.
I wonder what he smokes.

1946
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:18,430
I wonder if we smoking Bama.
Love that.

1947
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:20,200
Look how much younger he looked at in 
that crazy.

1948
01:25:20,201 --> 01:25:21,910
Yeah.
That was like a week ago.

1949
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:27,070
That dude aged more than any other 
president.

1950
01:25:27,071 --> 01:25:30,700
He is stressed the fuck out.
I wonder what it is.

1951
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:36,090
I've always wondered if it's stress or 
if it's a lack of sleep or if it's.

1952
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:39,940
They showed them where the aliens live.
I hope it's the latter.

1953
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:41,890
That would be the best one or the third 
one.

1954
01:25:41,891 --> 01:25:45,910
He knows too much about the alien agenda
that would keep you up at night.

1955
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:51,480
Yeah.
That's why he plays along with the 

1956
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:51,480
rules.
He's like,

1957
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:51,480
it doesn't matter.
Right?

1958
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,751
The earth.
Do you want me to fucking know what's 

1959
01:25:54,751 --> 01:25:54,751
behind the moon?
It's right there.

1960
01:25:54,751 --> 01:25:55,960
No,
but in all seriousness,

1961
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:59,410
no one person should have a job that 
does that to them.

1962
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:05,060
I know a job that is everybody just in a
crazy way.

1963
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:11,080
That's a great lesson.
The president is a great lesson for 

1964
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:11,080
people.
Yeah.

1965
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:13,430
Like don't,
don't work that hard.

1966
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:18,550
Right?
Look what happens to the president when 

1967
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:21,491
he works at heart.
Like you're going to burn that thing 

1968
01:26:21,491 --> 01:26:21,491
out,
man.

1969
01:26:21,491 --> 01:26:22,790
And everybody's going for a second term.
Like everybody goes.

1970
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:25,850
Anybody quit?
Does anybody ever get to four years ago?

1971
01:26:25,851 --> 01:26:26,500
You know what,
man?

1972
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:28,160
Fuck this.
Not recently.

1973
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:30,260
Not In the last 20 years.
Is it ever happened?

1974
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:35,290
Let's find out.
I'm going to say a president has never 

1975
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:35,290
quit.
Okay.

1976
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:35,990
I mean,
Richard Nixon was impeached.

1977
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,980
The president ever reside.
What do you think,

1978
01:26:39,981 --> 01:26:40,880
Brian?
No,

1979
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:44,550
I think Teddy Roosevelt did really?
And I said,

1980
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:46,190
uh,
a physical issue.

1981
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:51,340
You know,
I think he didn't want to hog it and 

1982
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:51,340
then he was bummed that he did it.
Richard Nixon,

1983
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:56,291
that's it.
Richard Nixon resigned from office and 

1984
01:26:56,901 --> 01:26:59,030
all he did was spy on people.
Yeah.

1985
01:26:59,031 --> 01:27:00,790
That's nothing.
No.

1986
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:05,820
Weird.
So he did and he did things that they 

1987
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:05,870
were already doing.

1988
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:08,240
Everybody was doing that.
There was spying on each other.

1989
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:13,900
Everybody spies on each other back then,
but the public wasn't ready for that 

1990
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,140
shit right now.
Not My America.

1991
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:16,430
Well,
it's kind of interesting,

1992
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:21,431
but that's how like a lot of weirdness 
went on with the CIA after the Nixon 

1993
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:29,620
administration got out of office.
Like that's when freedom of information 

1994
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:33,230
act was like all over the news.
It was a big issues.

1995
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:34,960
And that's when they had this,
uh,

1996
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:39,050
this nuclear submarine that was a 
Russian nuclear submarine.

1997
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:41,900
It's an issue of a or an episode of 
Radio Lab,

1998
01:27:41,901 --> 01:27:45,410
which is one of my favorite podcasts.
And the what,

1999
01:27:45,411 --> 01:27:45,750
uh,
uh,

2000
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,060
Glomar responses either Glo,
Mar.

2001
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:51,380
It was a corporation,
global marine.

2002
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:56,150
And they were responsIble for rescuing 
this nuclear submarine.

2003
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:01,240
They had a contract to pull this nuclear
submarine that the russians had lost 

2004
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:01,880
from the bottom of the ocean was like 
seven mile thing,

2005
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:03,380
crazy thing.

2006
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:08,180
And so when the news got leaked and they
had to respond to the press,

2007
01:28:08,181 --> 01:28:12,080
they were being asked whether or not 
they had this nuclear submarine in their

2008
01:28:12,081 --> 01:28:17,081
possession and they,
they knew because of the freedom of 

2009
01:28:17,081 --> 01:28:19,040
information act that they had to give a 
response they had to answer.

2010
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,520
So the response was,
I can neither confirm nor deny.

2011
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:27,730
Right?
And that's become something that people 

2012
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:29,591
say constantly.
I can neither confirm nor deny that mr 

2013
01:28:29,591 --> 01:28:32,890
sheen was in that whorehouse.
I can neither confirm nor deny that mr 

2014
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:34,550
brian was with this woman.
They,

2015
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:38,280
when they do stuff like that,
that's called a glo mar response.

2016
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:43,780
And then it all came out of this because
of the nixon administration's fuckups 

2017
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:46,310
because everybody was like aghast at 
watergate and they wanted to acute,

2018
01:28:46,311 --> 01:28:48,230
told us you didn't do anything.
He lied.

2019
01:28:48,231 --> 01:28:51,980
We're going to get those layers.
We're going to go after those liars.

2020
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:54,660
So that's,
uh,

2021
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:57,770
that's where all that shit came from 
until they got good at lying in.

2022
01:28:58,690 --> 01:29:02,160
Now that now they got it down.
I saw

2023
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:03,580
a,
I don't know,

2024
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:06,900
you've probably talked about jfk a lot 
on this podcast,

2025
01:29:06,901 --> 01:29:07,590
right?
Or not.

2026
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:08,280
Oh,
for sure.

2027
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:11,460
I just sAw this recent thing on cnn and 
it was all about like,

2028
01:29:11,461 --> 01:29:13,420
yeah,
oswald did it [inaudible].

2029
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:15,540
I mean,
I always thought,

2030
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:20,220
I always thought it was like this big 
conspiracy and now we're back to oswald.

2031
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:20,520
Did it.

2032
01:29:20,890 --> 01:29:24,850
The mainstream America version is that 
oswald?

2033
01:29:24,851 --> 01:29:25,660
Did it.
I mean,

2034
01:29:25,661 --> 01:29:27,420
if you want to listen to,
uh,

2035
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:30,790
most of the mainstream experts,
you know,

2036
01:29:30,791 --> 01:29:33,070
quote unquote,
that are on television,

2037
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:34,960
they say oswald did it alone.
Yeah.

2038
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,630
I don't think he did a loan.
I don't think it makes any sense.

2039
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:42,720
Right.
but it's one of those things that you 

2040
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,421
really don't know unless you were there 
and there's enough information back and 

2041
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:47,350
forth on both sides where the whole 
thing gets incredibly sketchy.

2042
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:49,320
Yeah.
I just saw those old,

2043
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:54,650
I guess their pbs documentaries from the
eighties a and those just seems.

2044
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:58,290
I don't know,
it just seemed like they had a lot of,

2045
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:03,700
not evidence exactly,
but other people's perspectives and we 

2046
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:05,800
saw other people dressed as cops and 
there might've been,

2047
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:11,700
but the problem is one of the things 
that they say about any experience when 

2048
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,820
something goes down,
like if some.

2049
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:18,670
There was a crazy explosion right across
the street from us right now and you and

2050
01:30:18,671 --> 01:30:23,671
I just happened to be outside shooting 
the shit podcast is over and the 

2051
01:30:23,671 --> 01:30:23,830
building across the street from us 
explodes.

2052
01:30:24,610 --> 01:30:28,090
We might have two completely different 
stories as to what went down.

2053
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:30,640
Right.
And if you compare those stories,

2054
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:32,950
one of us might not have been paying 
attention.

2055
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:35,110
One of us mighT have a problem with the 
truth.

2056
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:37,990
One of us might want to exaggerate when 
a camera's there.

2057
01:30:37,991 --> 01:30:41,260
One of us might want to make it seem 
like he was a hero.

2058
01:30:41,261 --> 01:30:46,261
One of us might want to make it seem 
like it was way more terrifying that 

2059
01:30:46,261 --> 01:30:46,600
he's actually been through something so 
much more horrifying.

2060
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,210
One of us might be the guy was a secret 
information.

2061
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:53,980
I saw a man run out of that car.
I witnessed it in evidence,

2062
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:56,380
right?
Eye witness accounts are terrible.

2063
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,790
They're really unreliable.
You ever talked to someone that you know

2064
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:06,150
and you guys went through some weird 
shit together and you go back and he 

2065
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:06,580
gives you a version of it and you 
compare it to your version.

2066
01:31:06,581 --> 01:31:08,680
You're like,
one of us is fucking crazy.

2067
01:31:08,681 --> 01:31:09,850
Absolutely.
Because I don't.

2068
01:31:09,851 --> 01:31:12,040
I don't remember any of this shit you're
talking about.

2069
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:13,990
Yeah,
that happens.

2070
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:14,740
Yeah.
So when you,

2071
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:20,010
when you hear about,
like people said they saw cops and 

2072
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:20,010
people said that,
that I,

2073
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:23,880
I witnessed the cia give the thumbs up 
and then the shooting started,

2074
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:24,970
right?
I was there.

2075
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:27,430
Yeah.
Maybe you were,

2076
01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:29,680
but maybe you're just making a bunch of 
shit up,

2077
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:32,320
right?
Memories a terrible dude.

2078
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:34,030
absolutely.
They're awful.

2079
01:31:34,210 --> 01:31:35,980
I know.
But if you look at the evidence,

2080
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,810
tough to shoot someone three times that,
that accurately from a,

2081
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:43,210
from a window with a rifle that has a 
shitty scope,

2082
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:44,200
but it is possible.

2083
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:46,420
Everybody says not possible.
It's possible.

2084
01:31:46,930 --> 01:31:49,240
The real problem is the impacts on the 
body.

2085
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:52,030
The magic bullet theory that went 
through one body.

2086
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:54,610
it's not magic.
So you're just confused about the.

2087
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:59,350
I've seen it all.
What's magic is the bullet hit bones,

2088
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:01,540
shatteRed bones,
and came out looking like that.

2089
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,970
That looks like a bullet that got shot 
into a swimming pool.

2090
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:06,640
And anybody who tells you any 
differently is not being honest.

2091
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:12,030
That seems weird.
Is it possible that the bone was 

2092
01:32:12,030 --> 01:32:13,330
shattered by that bullet and it came out
looking like that?

2093
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:16,360
It's very unlikely.
Very,

2094
01:32:16,361 --> 01:32:18,310
very unlikely.
It might be possible.

2095
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:20,980
I mean in the freakiest of freaky 
circumstances.

2096
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:24,220
But when bullets hit things,
they fuck up.

2097
01:32:24,221 --> 01:32:26,020
They twist up,
they bend.

2098
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:28,240
Just what happens.
Um,

2099
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:33,360
you know,
there's stronger bullets than other 

2100
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:33,360
ones.
Full metal jacket,

2101
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:33,520
bullets like that one a little bit 
stronger.

2102
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:38,850
But you're talking about like a bullet 
that left fragments and people's bodies 

2103
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:42,541
to.
It wasn't as simple as the bullet got 

2104
01:32:42,541 --> 01:32:42,541
through shattered bone cleanly and fell 
onto that.

2105
01:32:42,541 --> 01:32:44,920
No,
it left little pieces of metal pieces of

2106
01:32:44,921 --> 01:32:47,320
metal that aren't actually missing from 
the bowl that they found.

2107
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:48,620
Yeah.
You know,

2108
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:50,310
it's,
it's screwy.

2109
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:55,470
Yeah.
It's the scrooge story and it's a story 

2110
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:55,480
that they,
they wanted that guy dead.

2111
01:32:55,690 --> 01:33:00,690
Everybody wanted that guy dead.
There was a bunch of people that wanted 

2112
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:00,690
that guy dead.
it wasn't a.

2113
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:03,460
It wasn't hard to imagine someone 
plotted to murder him.

2114
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:08,520
Right.
It seems pretty likely that someone 

2115
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,760
wanted to murder him and I don't think 
it's likely that oswald wanted to do it.

2116
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:10,780
Right.
You know,

2117
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:13,990
I think it's way more likely that some 
of these incredibly powerful groups that

2118
01:33:13,991 --> 01:33:16,360
would profit off of him being dead would
want him dead.

2119
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:20,230
And I think back then in 1969,
19,

2120
01:33:20,231 --> 01:33:23,110
63 is it were you,
you weren't at accountable,

2121
01:33:23,111 --> 01:33:24,490
man,
you can get away with shit.

2122
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,310
Right.
But I also think that people like to tie

2123
01:33:27,311 --> 01:33:29,950
up history with a nice neat little bow.
You know,

2124
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:33,160
you know what?
Forget all your conspiracy shenanigans.

2125
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:38,340
Oswaldo acted alone.
It was a weird news program.

2126
01:33:38,501 --> 01:33:40,990
It was on cnn and it was very much like.
It was very much like,

2127
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:42,100
come on.
Yeah,

2128
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:45,010
it was a as well where like two hours 
straight.

2129
01:33:45,550 --> 01:33:48,400
I would like to see someone who knows a 
lot about the case,

2130
01:33:48,401 --> 01:33:49,450
debate them,
not me,

2131
01:33:49,451 --> 01:33:51,520
but someone who actually knows a lot 
about the case,

2132
01:33:51,521 --> 01:33:53,050
debate them,
you know,

2133
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:56,110
my take is that it's not an either or.
You know,

2134
01:33:56,111 --> 01:33:58,840
when everyone oswald did this,
oswaldo did that.

2135
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:02,680
Oswald did it,
or oswald was a part of it.

2136
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:04,510
That's possible as well.

2137
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:06,460
And that's one thing that people aren't 
considering.

2138
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:11,200
The idea that oswald got killed because 
he knew too much.

2139
01:34:11,201 --> 01:34:12,580
He was going to expose it.
Well,

2140
01:34:12,650 --> 01:34:14,620
it could have been the he got killed 
because look,

2141
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:19,860
they arrested him.
If we kill him then they're not even 

2142
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:19,860
going to know about all the other 
shooters,

2143
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:24,781
but if they hold that guy and start 
interrogating him and he starts telling 

2144
01:34:24,781 --> 01:34:26,380
about the entire plan and then someone 
gets in trouble.

2145
01:34:26,381 --> 01:34:31,381
So what do they do?
They murder him in front of a bunch of 

2146
01:34:31,381 --> 01:34:31,381
cops.
Yeah.

2147
01:34:31,381 --> 01:34:31,500
They had a guy with mob ties do it.
Right.

2148
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:32,870
Hilarious.
The whole,

2149
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:38,110
the whole thing stinks.
And anybody who pretends it doesn't 

2150
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:41,701
stink.
You're just trying to put like a neat 

2151
01:34:41,701 --> 01:34:42,880
little bow on it and be the guy who's 
not a your unknown nonsense guy.

2152
01:34:42,881 --> 01:34:44,800
I know that I'm a no nonsense guy.

2153
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,500
Okay?
We both know kevin has walled,

2154
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:49,990
acted alone.
Come end of story.

2155
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:53,080
Am I right?
Jesus is fucking hippies.

2156
01:34:53,310 --> 01:34:54,760
They want it.
They'll believe anything.

2157
01:34:55,330 --> 01:34:58,940
Lee harvey oswald.
I don't know,

2158
01:34:58,941 --> 01:35:01,690
man.
I just know that that's a.

2159
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:04,610
It's a crazy thing that they can kill 
the president.

2160
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:06,860
It is,
And if they did get away with it,

2161
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:12,490
if there is a group of people,
whether it's the cia or the fbi or the 

2162
01:35:12,490 --> 01:35:15,080
fucking mob or whoever it was,
if someone did get away with killing the

2163
01:35:15,081 --> 01:35:16,640
president,
that's incredible.

2164
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:19,850
It's insane.
You know?

2165
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:22,010
Well,
people can't keep secrets.

2166
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:25,970
That's proven fact.
There's no way.

2167
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:31,180
That's the number one reason why you 
should think that because people can't 

2168
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:31,250
keep secrets.
People will always kept sacred.

2169
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,530
I think I'd be able to keep a secret 
that would put me in jail.

2170
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:35,360
People are pretty good at keeping 
secrets.

2171
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:40,450
Anybody who says that people are bad at 
keeping secrets just is not taking into 

2172
01:35:40,450 --> 01:35:42,950
account how many fucking secrets there 
really are that they don't know about.

2173
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:45,350
What you're seeing is the shitty 
secrets.

2174
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:50,560
You know when you,
when you see someone get busted for 

2175
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,050
something where were seen as a bunch of 
weak,

2176
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:55,910
weak john bitches flapping off at the 
gums and ruin in there.

2177
01:35:55,911 --> 01:35:57,440
Perfect situation.
yeah,

2178
01:35:57,441 --> 01:35:58,490
that's what.
That's what you're saying.

2179
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:01,230
But another group might be able to dress
up like an hour.

2180
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:06,250
God sacrifice a hooker light on fire.
Go back to work at the mall and give 

2181
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:11,051
each other the little owl sign.
Fucking make their way to the bathroom 

2182
01:36:11,051 --> 01:36:12,110
passing away and he might keep that day 
they die.

2183
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:17,400
Yeah.
It might be fun for them like being a 

2184
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:17,400
mason or something.
Yeah.

2185
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:17,750
Fight club.
Yeah,

2186
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:21,280
jihadist.
That's definitely something too.

2187
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:23,780
It's a radical life,
you know,

2188
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,930
giving sacrifices,
but you're doing it for a law about that

2189
01:36:26,931 --> 01:36:28,190
blown up bitches.
Yeah.

2190
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,560
Making it real.
Keeping chicks from driving,

2191
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:33,670
keeping chicks from being seen.

2192
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:34,980
Yeah.
Cover up,

2193
01:36:34,981 --> 01:36:36,940
cover up and no driving.
Don,

2194
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:42,210
my religion says so my religions as so

2195
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:48,030
I sat next to two women on a.
I've took a greyhound bus for the first 

2196
01:36:48,030 --> 01:36:48,400
time over my midwest animal.
Why'd you do that?

2197
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:51,910
Because the budget was dwindling and I 
needed to get back to cleveland.

2198
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:56,530
That's real and so I took the greyhound 
and sitting next to me were two women in

2199
01:36:56,531 --> 01:37:01,531
burkas and it was hot and it didn't 
smell good.

2200
01:37:03,730 --> 01:37:04,960
Oh,
it was hot out.

2201
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:07,210
It wasn't sexy.
It wasn't sexy.

2202
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:11,350
It was sexy.
There's a little bit of sexiness to it,

2203
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:13,090
but there's something to do it.
It's like,

2204
01:37:13,091 --> 01:37:14,420
let's make a deal.
It was like,

2205
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,300
what's going on under that?
It would be great.

2206
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:23,800
It would be great if they were hot and 
they were just into doing it because 

2207
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:23,950
they only one in the show themselves for
their man.

2208
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:25,540
Yeah.
If it was their idea,

2209
01:37:25,570 --> 01:37:26,750
yeah,
that'd be kinda cool.

2210
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,720
Right.
that would be kind of wild.

2211
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:31,090
If you dated a chick and she just 
started showing up.

2212
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:34,660
she showed up with a itch hot as fuck.
She wear a burka and you're like,

2213
01:37:34,661 --> 01:37:37,360
why are you wearing a burqa?
I don't want anybody to see me,

2214
01:37:37,361 --> 01:37:38,590
but you.
Oh my god.

2215
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:40,420
It'd be like,
whoa,

2216
01:37:40,690 --> 01:37:43,090
that's crazy.
That's pretty hot.

2217
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:48,390
That's an intense.
But that's also a chick who will burn 

2218
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:49,690
your fucking hold town down in hopes of 
killing you when you break up with her.

2219
01:37:50,310 --> 01:37:55,310
she loves you.
She'll fucking set a gas leak in your 

2220
01:37:55,310 --> 01:37:58,950
town slowly in the middle of that.
I should plan it out in advance.

2221
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:01,350
Yeah,
that sounds like a crazy bitch.

2222
01:38:01,351 --> 01:38:04,410
But whoever the guy was at first 
invented the burka.

2223
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:06,710
What a hater.
Steve burke.

2224
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,850
What a bitch.
That guys are cock blocker.

2225
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:11,340
Yeah.
That guy is the worst pimp hand ever.

2226
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:14,760
Pimp pants a week.
He has to cover his chicks up.

2227
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,210
Come on up so much.
You're looking at like this.

2228
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:19,530
This is it.
everything else.

2229
01:38:19,531 --> 01:38:21,990
Cloth.
So heartbreaking.

2230
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,930
What's a big part of the world?
You know,

2231
01:38:24,931 --> 01:38:28,740
it's not like 20 people are doing it and
it's hard to get rid of the psychology.

2232
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:29,940
Oh,
it's impossible,

2233
01:38:29,941 --> 01:38:30,840
right?
Yeah,

2234
01:38:30,841 --> 01:38:32,220
man.
Bum you out.

2235
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,080
You want to rescue those chicks?
It does bum me out,

2236
01:38:34,081 --> 01:38:36,150
but I think they're past the point of 
being rescued.

2237
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:41,210
Do you?
Never know they might want to put the 

2238
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:41,210
effort in,
but if I could do it like that,

2239
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:44,130
then I mean it kinda just bums me out.

2240
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:45,960
If you could take them to the amazon.
Yeah.

2241
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:51,260
Show them the dragon,
taken for a ride and then immediately 

2242
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:54,570
bring them back and sort of reinvigorate
them back into society.

2243
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

2244
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:57,060
Do it.
He would do it.

2245
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:59,670
If it took like maybe a week or two.
I'm not going to dedicate my life.

2246
01:38:59,671 --> 01:39:01,350
You should offer that as a service.
I should.

2247
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:03,120
The full charge.
that's what you call it.

2248
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:05,870
I'm a comedian,
podcaster and burqa.

2249
01:39:05,871 --> 01:39:06,730
Liberate.
Yeah.

2250
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,430
Burka liberate.
Or I like it,

2251
01:39:08,431 --> 01:39:13,431
dude.
He just take these arab chicks not 

2252
01:39:13,431 --> 01:39:13,620
having a good go of it.
How's your passport ladies?

2253
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:17,550
How is it fresh?
Is it ready for a peruse stamp chunk?

2254
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:20,100
Now you're naked.
Yeah.

2255
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:22,520
Next thing you know you're partying with
the full charge.

2256
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:26,550
They'd probably never drank before.
So what to do with that shit?

2257
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:29,340
We traveled by grey hounds.
Yeah.

2258
01:39:29,341 --> 01:39:34,341
That would be rude to try to get someone
drunk for the first time once you've 

2259
01:39:34,341 --> 01:39:34,341
liberated them for their burqa.

2260
01:39:34,341 --> 01:39:35,190
Yeah,
that's.

2261
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:38,220
You don't have that kind of experience.
You can't just drink,

2262
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:43,780
drink,
and party when you've been wearing a 

2263
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:43,780
burka your whole life.
No.

2264
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:45,270
Reading off some ancient texts can't do 
it.

2265
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:47,940
how long has it been around?
If you had to guess?

2266
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:53,030
if I had to guess.
I would say it's been around for fuck 

2267
01:39:54,270 --> 01:39:56,790
over 2000 years,
but I really don't know.

2268
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:57,590
Alright.
We're gonna.

2269
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,520
Find out.
I'm going to say I'm going to say you're

2270
01:39:59,521 --> 01:40:02,130
right.
As the burka.

2271
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:05,820
After a.
Before gbc.

2272
01:40:05,821 --> 01:40:07,740
My,
my history in bc is very fuzzy.

2273
01:40:08,910 --> 01:40:09,750
Alright,
here we go.

2274
01:40:09,751 --> 01:40:14,751
I'm in a diy kind of guy.
Face veiling portion is usually a 

2275
01:40:15,691 --> 01:40:20,691
rectangular piece of semi-transparent 
cloth with this top edge attached to a 

2276
01:40:20,691 --> 01:40:24,030
portion of the headscarf.
Okay.

2277
01:40:24,031 --> 01:40:29,031
When did it come from islamic texts?
The quran has no requirement that women 

2278
01:40:31,021 --> 01:40:35,790
covered their faces with a veil or cover
their bodies with the full body berko.

2279
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,910
That's near my burka,
the full body burchell buddy.

2280
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:43,590
It's called a chador.
It's not in the koran.

2281
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:48,770
Many muslims believe that the collective
traditions of the life of mohammed or 

2282
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:53,360
hadith required both men and women to 
dress and behave in public.

2283
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,440
However,
thiS requirement has been interpreted in

2284
01:40:56,441 --> 01:41:00,160
many different ways by islamic scholars 
and muslim communities.

2285
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:05,820
Some interpretation say that avail is 
not a compulsory is not compulsory or 

2286
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:07,870
that it's not compulsory in front of 
blind men,

2287
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:13,080
a sexual men or gay men,
but gay men are allowed to either a 

2288
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:13,210
bunch of.
I don't know.

2289
01:41:13,211 --> 01:41:14,320
Yeah.
You're supposed to get rid of them,

2290
01:41:14,321 --> 01:41:16,660
right?
They're supposed to hit them with rocks.

2291
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:19,900
Very strange.
say what you want about America.

2292
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:22,240
Yeah.
well,

2293
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:24,760
the real problem is when we were talking
about before,

2294
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:27,940
a lot of these areas they've been.
They've been lIving like this for a long

2295
01:41:27,941 --> 01:41:28,900
time.
Yeah.

2296
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:30,430
It's.
It's hard to get out of that.

2297
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:34,210
It's hard to snap that,
stop that culture dead in his tracks and

2298
01:41:34,211 --> 01:41:37,960
try to figure out a better way to live 
your lives and to do it in a way that is

2299
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:41,290
completely alien to thousands and 
thousands of years of tradition.

2300
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:46,380
That's the thing,
like you've got to come up with these 

2301
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:48,511
ideas by yourself and you've got to 
figure out how to get away from it when 

2302
01:41:48,511 --> 01:41:49,510
no one's there to help you.
I assume,

2303
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:54,960
listen to this and say to the faithful 
woman to lower their gaze and guard 

2304
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,310
their private parts and not to display 
their beauty,

2305
01:41:57,490 --> 01:42:02,490
except when except what is apparent of 
it except what is a parent of it,

2306
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:08,580
and to extend their head coverings to 
cover their bosoms and not to display 

2307
01:42:10,391 --> 01:42:13,960
their beauty except to their husbands or
their fathers or their husbands,

2308
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:18,961
fathers or their sons or their husbands,
sons or their brothers or their 

2309
01:42:18,961 --> 01:42:23,011
brothers,
sons or their sister's sons or their 

2310
01:42:23,011 --> 01:42:24,820
women folk or what their right hands 
rule.

2311
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:29,440
WhetheR tennis instructor leaves their 
slaves nice.

2312
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:34,300
Or the followers from the men who do not
feel sexual desire.

2313
01:42:34,570 --> 01:42:39,570
What the followers from the men who do 
not feel sexual desire or small children

2314
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:43,180
to whom the nakedness of women is not a 
parent,

2315
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:48,660
and not to strike their feet on the 
ground so as to make known what they 

2316
01:42:48,851 --> 01:42:51,250
hide of their adornments.

2317
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:54,170
Strike their feet on the ground.
So their tits jiggle,

2318
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:59,580
they're saying don't make your ass and 
tits jiggle chicks were working in the 

2319
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:04,350
old days.
This is an anti twerking passage in the 

2320
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:04,350
koran.
That's where it all starts.

2321
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:08,431
That's what they're saying.
That's where civilization don't stomp 

2322
01:43:08,431 --> 01:43:11,311
your feet on the ground as to make known
what they hide of their adornments.

2323
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:15,790
Whoa man.
That's deep.

2324
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:17,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

2325
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:18,310
Depresses me,
man.

2326
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:19,330
Does it.
Well,

2327
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:23,470
didn't you just read that?
It's not reAlly part of the koran.

2328
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:25,340
No,
no it's not.

2329
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,790
Which is always.
Some muslim societies don't,

2330
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:28,870
uh,
don't use it.

2331
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:34,560
So that happens all the time.
Like religions will just adopt an idea.

2332
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,560
Like there's a lot of christians that 
like going to war,

2333
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:44,280
that type of thing.
Well there's all sorts of weird 

2334
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:47,011
interpretations of old languages too.
That's what things gets kind of 

2335
01:43:47,011 --> 01:43:50,911
squirrely when you're reading some shit.
There was something that's 2000 old or 

2336
01:43:51,801 --> 01:43:52,130
even

2337
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:54,170
more,
I mean the context,

2338
01:43:54,171 --> 01:43:59,171
like trying to put it in context,
trying to figure out what life was like 

2339
01:43:59,171 --> 01:44:00,140
back then and why are they smarter than 
us?

2340
01:44:00,141 --> 01:44:02,570
Why are we looking to them?
Yeah.

2341
01:44:02,571 --> 01:44:03,020
Well,
I mean,

2342
01:44:03,021 --> 01:44:05,280
I feel like we're smarter than them yet.
Dah,

2343
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:08,240
dah.
Thinking again.

2344
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:10,160
Yeah,
but you know what it is,

2345
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:11,840
man.
We like old shit.

2346
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:13,670
We do.
We love old shit.

2347
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,490
Yeah.
We're doing this because our forefathers

2348
01:44:16,491 --> 01:44:18,830
did this.
We'd love the ancient texts.

2349
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,680
Yeah,
ancient wisdom and ancient scholars.

2350
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:23,330
People love that.
They love it.

2351
01:44:23,331 --> 01:44:26,840
They can find something from the past 
that was forgotten.

2352
01:44:27,110 --> 01:44:29,870
The ancient scholars knew all about 
life.

2353
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:35,080
The origins of the universe.
Like when we find something on the wall 

2354
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:39,230
of some sort of a temple in Iraq,
it's thousands of years old and it's the

2355
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:40,910
solar system.
people freak out.

2356
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:46,120
This is amazing.
Look at the knowledge they had like my 

2357
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:47,730
six year old draws solar systems that 
good.

2358
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,140
I'm not joking.
Right?

2359
01:44:51,141 --> 01:44:53,000
They dropped.
She drew the sun,

2360
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:56,090
jupiter and earth.
She copied it off of a book,

2361
01:44:56,091 --> 01:44:58,220
but my what?
My point is like,

2362
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:00,750
that's a shitty solar system,
right?

2363
01:45:00,830 --> 01:45:02,210
That was 6,000
years ago.

2364
01:45:02,211 --> 01:45:05,060
Of course our solar systems.
But have you ever watched cosmos?

2365
01:45:05,061 --> 01:45:06,440
You fuck.
Okay.

2366
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:11,650
Our version of the solar system is way 
better than that old dumb shit cart.

2367
01:45:12,911 --> 01:45:14,540
Yeah.
It's impressive that they did this.

2368
01:45:14,570 --> 01:45:15,650
Yes,
absolutely.

2369
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:16,760
Yes.
It's fascinating.

2370
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Yes.
It's a historically enriching that we 

2371
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:22,610
could look at this stuff and you mean 
it's a trip you go.

2372
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:23,860
have you ever been to like,
uh,

2373
01:45:23,861 --> 01:45:27,020
the natural history museum and checked 
out some ancient egyptian artifacts?

2374
01:45:27,510 --> 01:45:29,780
it's fascinating.
And fantastic.

2375
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:32,360
King tut baby.
Fuck yeah.

2376
01:45:32,361 --> 01:45:37,361
That's fascinating.
You get to look at something that was 

2377
01:45:37,361 --> 01:45:40,211
made thousands of years ago.
People that just lived a completely 

2378
01:45:40,211 --> 01:45:40,211
different way than you.
It's humbling.

2379
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:42,740
And fonzie's jacket.
Fonzie's jacket.

2380
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:45,350
No,
that's all at the dc dc museums.

2381
01:45:45,530 --> 01:45:47,270
They really have fonzie.
Fonzie jacket.

2382
01:45:47,290 --> 01:45:48,590
Credibly.
Puffy shirt.

2383
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:51,050
Fonzie jackets.
Tiny.

2384
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:54,290
Yeah.
How tall is henry winkler?

2385
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:55,380
I don't know.
I,

2386
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,200
I had a picture with hiM.
I took a picture with him.

2387
01:45:57,530 --> 01:45:59,270
He'S a great guy.
he was on that show.

2388
01:45:59,271 --> 01:46:04,271
Uh,
one of the movies that I did with Kevin 

2389
01:46:04,271 --> 01:46:04,271
James.
Here comes the boom.

2390
01:46:04,271 --> 01:46:04,560
He was the teacher.
Yeah.

2391
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:06,740
Great guy.
He's so nice.

2392
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:11,800
Yeah,
it seems like henry winkler is one of 

2393
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:13,451
the nicest people I've ever met.
He's just genuinely openly nice and 

2394
01:46:13,451 --> 01:46:16,280
friendly and he,
he loves to fly fish.

2395
01:46:16,730 --> 01:46:21,730
He loves to go out and fly fish on 
rivers and stuff and he wrote a book 

2396
01:46:21,730 --> 01:46:22,370
about it called never met an idiot on 
the river.

2397
01:46:22,610 --> 01:46:23,000
Yeah.

2398
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:28,040
Probably got really lucky if that's the 
case.

2399
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:30,620
It's a lot of fucking idiots on the 
river.

2400
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:31,310
Yeah,
no,

2401
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:36,970
that's true.
How often do you do those tours where 

2402
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:36,970
you go out for lIke three weeks like 
that?

2403
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:38,060
Not often.
Not often.

2404
01:46:38,061 --> 01:46:43,061
I,
I've been doing recently because I've 

2405
01:46:43,061 --> 01:46:45,040
been a opening for christ.
You're doing split weeks and I kinda got

2406
01:46:45,041 --> 01:46:47,570
to like do a tour to make them work,
you know,

2407
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:53,140
and then I try to hit stuff in between 
and then I'll do a throw in like a 

2408
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:57,231
headlining thing.
It just doesn't make a lot of sense to 

2409
01:46:57,231 --> 01:46:59,511
come all the way back to la,
but I'm kinda over that because it's 

2410
01:46:59,511 --> 01:47:00,270
just not that much fun and it wears you 
down.

2411
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:02,240
I mean the chrysler parts are fun.
The crusher,

2412
01:47:02,241 --> 01:47:07,241
you know what I mean?
When you go on the road for three weeks 

2413
01:47:07,241 --> 01:47:08,070
is hard as fuck when I'm just chilling 
in valley park,

2414
01:47:08,071 --> 01:47:10,740
Missouri and like 15 people are showing 
up at night.

2415
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:13,170
It's horrible.
It was.

2416
01:47:13,171 --> 01:47:15,810
Where are we doing the coMedy store in 
Missouri?

2417
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:21,060
Saturday night was good,
But so two shows were great and then the

2418
01:47:21,061 --> 01:47:23,720
other four were just like that comedy 
store,

2419
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:28,740
original room style of comedy.
Could you do like thursday through 

2420
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:32,121
sunday and I went.
You did the third thursday through 

2421
01:47:32,121 --> 01:47:32,121
sunday.
wow.

2422
01:47:32,121 --> 01:47:36,420
it's so funny too because I only have 
like a couple of fans so actual fans 

2423
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:38,250
will come up to see me do.
Shell is in front of 15 people,

2424
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:41,100
you know?
That's got to be weird,

2425
01:47:41,101 --> 01:47:46,101
but it is with them.
It's got to be cool as fuck though 

2426
01:47:46,101 --> 01:47:46,101
because look,
they're a little concerned.

2427
01:47:46,101 --> 01:47:48,120
They shouldn't.
They should look at it this way.

2428
01:47:48,390 --> 01:47:53,390
You're funny.
Talented and it's just a matter of 

2429
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:53,870
people knowing about it.
So they,

2430
01:47:53,890 --> 01:47:56,640
they get into the ground floor,
they get mad street credit.

2431
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:59,170
Right.
They dope deal with there.

2432
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:04,280
I saw richard jenny perform in front of 
a very small crowd at catch a rising 

2433
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:04,740
star on like a wednesday night one night
in boston.

2434
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:07,950
I'll never forget that.
There was half full audience,

2435
01:48:08,370 --> 01:48:13,370
you know,
it was like nobody knew who he was back 

2436
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:13,370
then,
but I was like,

2437
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:13,410
wow,
this is amazing,

2438
01:48:13,610 --> 01:48:18,610
you know,
so they got to see you when you eat and 

2439
01:48:18,610 --> 01:48:18,610
shit.
And I am,

2440
01:48:18,610 --> 01:48:18,660
I am.
I'm half joking.

2441
01:48:18,661 --> 01:48:20,520
Like could the shows were actually all 
really fun.

2442
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,990
They were just like before the show 
started,

2443
01:48:22,991 --> 01:48:26,760
it's like 15 people.
here we go.

2444
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,820
and that was the whole audience.
15 people some nights.

2445
01:48:30,290 --> 01:48:35,290
Yeah,
it could get up to 20 and I think the 

2446
01:48:35,290 --> 01:48:35,290
good nights kick get up.
It was too good.

2447
01:48:35,290 --> 01:48:39,621
Shows with about 50,
60 people and those were like a lot of 

2448
01:48:39,621 --> 01:48:43,041
fun,
especially compared to the smaller 

2449
01:48:43,041 --> 01:48:44,991
shows.
But it was never horrible because they 

2450
01:48:44,991 --> 01:48:46,440
did laugh,
you know what I mean?

2451
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:48,960
But you're funny and that's the hardest 
thing to do,

2452
01:48:48,990 --> 01:48:52,200
so all matters from here on out is just 
you just keep doing it.

2453
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:54,660
You just keep doing it.
There'll be able to laugh one day.

2454
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:55,710
Sure.
There'll be able to say,

2455
01:48:55,711 --> 01:48:58,260
I saw you in front of 15 people right in
Nebraska.

2456
01:48:58,310 --> 01:48:59,360
Yeah.
And you'd be like,

2457
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:04,400
I remember that chat.
This club was kind of ghetto like after 

2458
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:08,871
my first show on thursday,
two people walked into the back alley 

2459
01:49:08,871 --> 01:49:09,780
and started screwing up against the 
dumpster.

2460
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:12,090
That staff found lace.
Yeah.

2461
01:49:12,330 --> 01:49:13,680
That's how you do it.
Yeah,

2462
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:16,950
but I mean that only goes to show you 
how inspiring I am as a comic.

2463
01:49:17,810 --> 01:49:18,660
You know what I mean?
Fuck,

2464
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:21,090
it's true.
Make people horny.

2465
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:23,070
A lot of people killed bonus with their 
comedy.

2466
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:24,120
Yeah,
exactly.

2467
01:49:24,121 --> 01:49:25,190
Excited them.
Not me.

2468
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:27,240
I make it sexy.
Where was this?

2469
01:49:27,241 --> 01:49:27,720
What club?

2470
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,730
Valley park,
Missouri.

2471
01:49:29,731 --> 01:49:32,760
Funny bone.
It's only been open since like october.

2472
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:38,500
Is it?
Is there A chain of funny bones or do 

2473
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:38,500
they buy the name?
How does that work?

2474
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:40,590
Because it seemed to be independent.
I don't fully understand it.

2475
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:45,950
There's people that own.
There's one guy that owns a bunch and 

2476
01:49:45,950 --> 01:49:47,980
then I think it's like a franchise you 
can kind of buy in or something.

2477
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,540
Like.
What about the funny bone of columbus?

2478
01:49:49,930 --> 01:49:51,740
that's a.
That's a guy named dave strube.

2479
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:53,050
There's a lot of those.
Oh,

2480
01:49:53,051 --> 01:49:55,600
he owns more than one of those.
He's a good dude.

2481
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:57,760
Yeah,
absolutely worked for that many times.

2482
01:49:58,100 --> 01:49:59,230
Yep.
That clubs great,

2483
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,870
funny columbus places.
Great.

2484
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:03,620
Or they just remodeled it.
It also.

2485
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:05,590
Why would they do that was perfect.
I didn't.

2486
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:07,450
I think they did somethiNg like they 
just made it bigger.

2487
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:10,570
That was always kind of weird.
They never really had a green room.

2488
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:12,330
That's bad.
That's the,

2489
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:15,610
that's weird.
You have to go to dave's office and hang

2490
01:50:15,611 --> 01:50:16,630
out,
but whatever.

2491
01:50:16,690 --> 01:50:17,620
You're in columbus,
Ohio,

2492
01:50:17,621 --> 01:50:22,621
you can get all high flutent.
What are you kinda gotta deal with what 

2493
01:50:22,621 --> 01:50:23,170
you've got to deal with.
But um,

2494
01:50:23,730 --> 01:50:24,550
uh,
I'm doing,

2495
01:50:24,580 --> 01:50:26,500
uh,
austin coming up soon.

2496
01:50:26,501 --> 01:50:27,750
I'm doing cap city.
Yeah,

2497
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,250
because I'm getting ready to do my 
comedy special.

2498
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:32,180
Some doing a week at the club.
They painted over all the.

2499
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:36,650
What's wrong with them?
So that was history.

2500
01:50:36,651 --> 01:50:39,590
I think the full charge wasn't fucking 
written up there because it was,

2501
01:50:39,620 --> 01:50:41,290
I'm sure it was just some paint now.
Yeah.

2502
01:50:41,291 --> 01:50:46,291
That was history that the wall was 
covered in history and they decided to 

2503
01:50:46,291 --> 01:50:46,291
make it pretty.
They.

2504
01:50:46,291 --> 01:50:49,270
Whoever did it was just a boner killer.
I don't know who did that.

2505
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:51,310
Whoever you are out there,
you know who you are.

2506
01:50:51,390 --> 01:50:53,820
Yeah.
Whoever gave it the green light,

2507
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:58,840
whoever whose ever idea it was atlanta.
Punchlines still got it.

2508
01:50:58,990 --> 01:51:00,530
My favorite one,
I think we talked about this.

2509
01:51:00,590 --> 01:51:03,520
My favorite thing was right in front of 
the toilet.

2510
01:51:03,730 --> 01:51:07,420
It said,
keep the toilet seat up so maybe it will

2511
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:10,260
make women not wanting to do comedy it 
or something like that.

2512
01:51:11,690 --> 01:51:12,900
Keep women out of comedy.

2513
01:51:15,470 --> 01:51:20,470
The best is the atlanta punchline that 
that back room still has writing 

2514
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:20,470
everywhere.
I haven't been there.

2515
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:22,610
I'm going there and never did it.
I'm going there in august.

2516
01:51:22,611 --> 01:51:23,960
I think you've never done it.
Never done it.

2517
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,250
Ooh.
It's a classic.

2518
01:51:25,690 --> 01:51:27,230
It's one of the best clubs.
Awesome.

2519
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:29,030
It's a real,
real legit,

2520
01:51:29,031 --> 01:51:30,440
awesome club.
Old school is.

2521
01:51:30,441 --> 01:51:32,240
Fuck you.
Look on the wall.

2522
01:51:32,241 --> 01:51:35,150
You see like an old barry sobel picture.
You know one of those.

2523
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:40,300
Love that shit.
Kenny rogers photo xannies in nashville 

2524
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:41,540
will not take down the old headshot and 
they shouldn't.

2525
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:42,650
No,
they shouldn't.

2526
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:45,140
Xannies in nashville is another one.
That's another classic spot,

2527
01:51:45,470 --> 01:51:47,900
but on the back room of the atlanta 
punchline says,

2528
01:51:47,901 --> 01:51:50,920
quit trying to be hicks.
Ah ha ha.

2529
01:51:51,190 --> 01:51:53,420
that was so appropriate to at the time.
Yeah.

2530
01:51:54,370 --> 01:51:55,270
Yeah.
oh dude.

2531
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:58,540
Everyone I knew try to be hicks.
Yeah.

2532
01:51:58,690 --> 01:52:01,750
And I mean we all got caught up in it,
like I went to,

2533
01:52:01,820 --> 01:52:06,250
like to open mics and somebody actually 
handed me a tape with bill hicks on it.

2534
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:09,670
It was woody allen and bill hicks,
you know,

2535
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:11,890
once I was bill hicks side was woody 
allen,

2536
01:52:11,891 --> 01:52:13,620
what did you like better?
Uh,

2537
01:52:13,710 --> 01:52:17,500
I definitely like bill hicks better.
I listened to this thing at the time and

2538
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:20,780
probably still do.
I'm not sure does.

2539
01:52:20,970 --> 01:52:24,850
Do you take off any points because woody
allen's a perv no,

2540
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:27,730
not for that.
I assume it wasn't that much prefer back

2541
01:52:27,731 --> 01:52:29,680
then.
That doesn't actually bother me.

2542
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:33,820
Not as much as a woman in a burka.
It does bother me,

2543
01:52:33,821 --> 01:52:35,620
but I still kinda like to watch his 
movies.

2544
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:37,420
A good movie maker.
Yeah.

2545
01:52:37,421 --> 01:52:38,470
So I,
I guess,

2546
01:52:39,250 --> 01:52:41,590
but I think that's kinda fucked up.
Yeah,

2547
01:52:41,650 --> 01:52:42,910
for sure.
Well,

2548
01:52:42,911 --> 01:52:46,070
there's a picture of him at the 
basketball game when

2549
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:51,070
his daughter was young and she sitting 
on his lap and she's really little and 

2550
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:54,761
then there's a picture of him at the 
basketball game many years later and 

2551
01:52:54,761 --> 01:52:56,930
they're holding hands as a couple.
so weird and it's just,

2552
01:52:56,931 --> 01:52:59,090
whoa.
I don't think that's okay at all.

2553
01:52:59,091 --> 01:53:00,890
I really don't.
That's deep that,

2554
01:53:00,910 --> 01:53:04,100
that is a completely different kind of 
experience that's deep.

2555
01:53:04,101 --> 01:53:05,810
Like you,
you were there when that thing,

2556
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:08,900
that thing,
that person was a baby,

2557
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:11,660
you know,
when a little child,

2558
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:13,160
I don't know.
You don't know?

2559
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:14,670
I don't know.
And I dunno,

2560
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,490
I dunno.
I choose not to speculate.

2561
01:53:16,730 --> 01:53:17,640
Yeah,
watched a,

2562
01:53:17,641 --> 01:53:19,750
I'm a,
I'm not callous about it.

2563
01:53:19,751 --> 01:53:20,320
I just,
you know,

2564
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:22,880
obviously I denounce it.
I'll say that it's gross,

2565
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:25,490
but I don't,
I don't know any of the particulars.

2566
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:30,790
Yeah.
I barely paid attention to that whole 

2567
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:30,790
case.
I just don't like to.

2568
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:34,670
Whenever I see people in those sort of 
terrifying situations,

2569
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:39,880
the man,
the women's splitting up the man going 

2570
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:40,880
after the girl's daughter and they're 
together now and like,

2571
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:44,480
oh,
a fucking crazy pain.

2572
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:47,210
But I was listening to a thing of the 
day,

2573
01:53:47,211 --> 01:53:52,211
I didn't know it was an interview,
I thought it was woody allen's comedy 

2574
01:53:52,211 --> 01:53:52,520
and I downloaded it and it Was,
um,

2575
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:57,610
it was woody allen talking about standup
and it was him talking about all of the,

2576
01:53:59,601 --> 01:54:04,601
um,
the different kinds of a joke writers 

2577
01:54:04,601 --> 01:54:06,320
and different.
And this is a long ass fucking time ago.

2578
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:08,810
And it was really kind of interesting,
man.

2579
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:09,930
It was,
um,

2580
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:12,380
it was really interesting to listen to 
him from like,

2581
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:13,280
gosh,
I don't know.

2582
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:18,580
I mean if I had to guess,
I'd say it was probably like the 19 

2583
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:18,580
fifties or something like that.
And he's talking about comedy.

2584
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:20,390
If I had to guess by the references that
he was using,

2585
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:25,780
maybe the sixties,
but he's talking about standup and he's 

2586
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:25,780
talking about,
you know,

2587
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:26,930
different.
And a lot of the shit that he was saying

2588
01:54:26,931 --> 01:54:29,510
back then still holds true today.
Yeah.

2589
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:36,990
Yeah.
I think he was part of that like kinda 

2590
01:54:36,990 --> 01:54:38,551
hipster original alt room comedy.
Like they just used to do it at 

2591
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:43,740
makeshift places in the village and not 
necessarily clubs or comedy clubs are 

2592
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:44,470
strip clubs or however,
whatever it was.

2593
01:54:44,471 --> 01:54:45,750
Trisha traditional back then.

2594
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:46,870
Yeah.
Isn't that wild?

2595
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:48,760
Yeah.
Like they would do it.

2596
01:54:48,940 --> 01:54:53,940
They would do it in,
like they would open for people to like 

2597
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:53,940
for bands and stuff like that.
That would do stand up.

2598
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:58,930
yeah.
And they just do it in coffee shops and 

2599
01:54:58,930 --> 01:54:58,930
stuff.
It's really weird because the con,

2600
01:54:58,930 --> 01:55:01,760
the standup comedy that we know today 
really started in the seventies,

2601
01:55:01,761 --> 01:55:03,650
right?
Um,

2602
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,100
maybe the sixties,
sixties.

2603
01:55:06,140 --> 01:55:08,150
Well it was lenny bruce really?
RigHt.

2604
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,290
That's the number one.
That's the first seed.

2605
01:55:10,950 --> 01:55:13,290
I think there was a bunch of other guys 
like that.

2606
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:18,360
There was sort of in that vein at the 
time that were coming along with him 

2607
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:19,650
back and forth.
But he Was the original.

2608
01:55:19,710 --> 01:55:20,070
Yeah.

2609
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:24,270
And there's even like old rodney 
dangerfield where he tries to do like a,

2610
01:55:24,271 --> 01:55:27,230
a,
a lenny bruce style where like,

2611
01:55:27,231 --> 01:55:30,460
it's a big long story and it's like,
you know,

2612
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:32,510
rodney dangerfield is known for one 
liners.

2613
01:55:32,530 --> 01:55:37,530
Yeah.
He used to do these really long form 

2614
01:55:37,530 --> 01:55:38,610
jokes about like getting his car fixed 
and riding in an airplane in

2615
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:43,980
a woody allen on comedy is the name of

2616
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:48,980
it.
It's available on amazon if anybody 

2617
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:49,890
wants to get it.
It's just a 10 different things.

2618
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:55,280
10 different short little clips that 
they have broken up into segments on a 

2619
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:56,520
different,
different topics.

2620
01:55:56,670 --> 01:55:57,540
Really.
Interesting.

2621
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:02,960
Really interesting.
I've alWays been fascinated by the 

2622
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:02,960
writing style.
You know,

2623
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:07,670
everybody's got their own sort of style 
and I'm also fascinated by how few 

2624
01:56:07,670 --> 01:56:07,670
people actually.
Right,

2625
01:56:07,670 --> 01:56:12,160
right.
And you find out that there's a lot of 

2626
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:12,890
comics that don't actually sit down and 
write a whole essay.

2627
01:56:12,891 --> 01:56:17,891
You can't fake it for an hour body to 
sit down with some coffee and scribble 

2628
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:23,510
lazy pitch.
You have the opportunity to be a 

2629
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:26,721
professional comedian.
You've actually figured out a way to 

2630
01:56:26,721 --> 01:56:27,330
make it through that.
You're not even writing anything down.

2631
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:28,960
It's crazy.
Oh,

2632
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:34,040
silly.
Because even if you write all the time 

2633
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:34,040
and you record a lot of your thoughts 
and stuff,

2634
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:38,210
there's still so few,
so little amount of material that makes 

2635
01:56:38,210 --> 01:56:38,210
it to the stage.
Yeah.

2636
01:56:38,210 --> 01:56:40,710
So like if you're doing nothing and 
nothing's happening,

2637
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:46,160
well that's those guys that you run into
10 years later and they're doing the 

2638
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:46,160
same act and you're like,
oh,

2639
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:47,370
you poor bastard,
you poor bastard.

2640
01:56:47,550 --> 01:56:52,550
It's not even changed,
like not even two minutes of it as 

2641
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:54,831
different nominees.
So scary sometimes that sometimes you 

2642
01:56:54,831 --> 01:56:58,551
just get a little life raft of an act 
and you just want to sit on it and just 

2643
01:56:58,551 --> 01:56:59,100
wait because that,
that,

2644
01:56:59,130 --> 01:57:01,170
that new joke.
It's a painful thing.

2645
01:57:03,570 --> 01:57:08,570
That's why it's an awesome growth 
process to do it the way he does it or 

2646
01:57:08,570 --> 01:57:10,350
does it or louis ck does it to do it 
that way.

2647
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,200
And abandoned ship.
Yeah.

2648
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:15,030
Imagine if bands had to do that every 
year.

2649
01:57:15,031 --> 01:57:17,040
They abandoned ship.
Yeah.

2650
01:57:17,041 --> 01:57:18,510
No,
they'd be in trouble because they got to

2651
01:57:18,511 --> 01:57:19,530
play the hits.
Fuck,

2652
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:24,560
that's for sure.
That's a difference between comedy and 

2653
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:24,560
music.
Yeah.

2654
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:24,960
The only one who got to play the hits 
and comedy was dice.

2655
01:57:25,530 --> 01:57:27,690
Yeah.
I heard rodney got to play the hits.

2656
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:28,470
Yeah,
I bet.

2657
01:57:28,471 --> 01:57:30,090
That's what I heard.
I forget where I heard that,

2658
01:57:30,091 --> 01:57:32,670
but I believe different times though,
that was a different era.

2659
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:35,160
You know?
You ever see rodney live?

2660
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:37,080
Never.
I used one of my favorites.

2661
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:40,020
I got to see him a few times.
I got to see him late in life too.

2662
01:57:40,021 --> 01:57:41,190
I got to see him at the laugh factory.

2663
01:57:41,190 --> 01:57:42,630
Like real late.
Yeah.

2664
01:57:42,810 --> 01:57:44,460
Yeah.
He was like in his sixties,

2665
01:57:44,730 --> 01:57:47,160
hanging out with some 40 year old chick.
Yeah.

2666
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:48,590
they're still partying.
Right?

2667
01:57:48,810 --> 01:57:51,630
That's a good buck a month.
Oh.

2668
01:57:52,170 --> 01:57:55,110
I always think it's really funny that 
when I was a kid in the eighties,

2669
01:57:55,620 --> 01:57:57,420
I wasn't heavily into rodney 
dangerfield,

2670
01:57:57,421 --> 01:57:59,700
but I go see his movies,
which is weird.

2671
01:57:59,701 --> 01:58:04,701
like what 11 year olds are going to see 
movies about 60 year olds now and 

2672
01:58:04,701 --> 01:58:05,850
laughing.
That's really weird.

2673
01:58:05,851 --> 01:58:07,740
So true.
That's a great way of puttiNg it,

2674
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:10,860
but he was also something someone that 
everybody loved.

2675
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:15,950
Yeah.
Like you didn't think of roddy is like 

2676
01:58:15,950 --> 01:58:15,950
an old guy.
Definitely not.

2677
01:58:15,950 --> 01:58:19,640
Yeah.
You would think of other old guys is 

2678
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:19,640
like old guys.
Yeah.

2679
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:20,100
He's like the coolest guy in back to 
school.

2680
01:58:20,430 --> 01:58:23,260
He's the coolest guy in the movie as the
oldest guy in the movie.

2681
01:58:23,261 --> 01:58:25,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

2682
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:30,700
who is this romantic interest?
Remember was the woman that does like 

2683
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:32,280
the true hidden valley commercials.
That's right.

2684
01:58:32,550 --> 01:58:34,020
Yeah.
She's a professor.

2685
01:58:34,050 --> 01:58:35,100
She was in meatballs three.

2686
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,130
How old was she at the time?
Dangerfield.

2687
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:42,790
Like 60.
If you had to guess.

2688
01:58:42,860 --> 01:58:47,770
She must have been somewhere around 50.
Maybe a lIttle younger.

2689
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:49,070
Really.
I don't know.

2690
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,090
I have a hard time with that because I 
found it very attractive.

2691
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:55,300
How attractive.
Like you bust a move.

2692
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:57,500
Yeah,
I think I would really.

2693
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:59,380
I think I would.
What's your age limit?

2694
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:04,620
You would cut a check off that I think.
I think around 55.

2695
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:06,730
Whoa.
You're a generous man.

2696
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:11,260
I mean it all depends.
It all depends on if she goes to yoga.

2697
01:59:11,690 --> 01:59:16,690
There's,
there's some good looking 55 out there 

2698
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:16,690
are now.
Yeah,

2699
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:16,690
there are now.
yeah.

2700
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:17,980
And scientific.
Have you seen christie brinkley?

2701
01:59:18,430 --> 01:59:20,170
Yes.
And that's exactly the type of thing I'm

2702
01:59:20,171 --> 01:59:25,171
talking about.
The old christie brinkley now she's up 

2703
01:59:25,171 --> 01:59:25,171
there.
She's taught as fuck.

2704
01:59:25,171 --> 01:59:25,780
You seen Helen Hunt lately?
No.

2705
01:59:25,781 --> 01:59:26,560
I don't need to do that.

2706
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:28,630
There's this movie called what?
He's trying to kill my boner,

2707
01:59:28,770 --> 01:59:31,390
talking to bring it up.
Helen hunt.

2708
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:35,450
You're going the wrong way,
but you got to hear this picture,

2709
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:39,550
chrissy buggy to cleanse my palette.
Let's take this conversation slow.

2710
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:40,630
There was,
this is getting exciting.

2711
01:59:40,631 --> 01:59:45,631
There was this movie called the session 
and if you just look up the preview of 

2712
01:59:45,631 --> 01:59:50,491
it,
it's about this guy that has an iron 

2713
01:59:50,491 --> 01:59:50,491
lung and he's,
you know,

2714
01:59:50,491 --> 01:59:52,600
he's very like stephen hawking and then 
maybe just laying there going,

2715
01:59:52,601 --> 01:59:54,310
oh,
you know like and stuff.

2716
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:58,000
And so helen hunt's like his therapist 
or something and he goes,

2717
01:59:58,030 --> 01:59:58,630
she's like,
ah,

2718
01:59:58,631 --> 02:00:01,240
you need to get laid.
So she starts taking off her clothes and

2719
02:00:01,241 --> 02:00:03,400
you see her full bush,
her body.

2720
02:00:03,950 --> 02:00:05,920
What movie is this?
It's called the session.

2721
02:00:05,950 --> 02:00:07,030
Is this an old movie?
Oh,

2722
02:00:07,031 --> 02:00:12,031
this came out like two years ago and 
it's just Helen Hunt fucking this 

2723
02:00:12,031 --> 02:00:12,031
retarded.

2724
02:00:12,031 --> 02:00:15,810
Get retarded.
This iron lung guy and it's just creepy 

2725
02:00:15,810 --> 02:00:19,141
as fuck.
It's just a creepy version of Helen 

2726
02:00:19,141 --> 02:00:19,141
Hunt.
Her face looks weird,

2727
02:00:19,141 --> 02:00:19,141
like,
okay,

2728
02:00:19,141 --> 02:00:21,580
and then you just see her bush and she's
having sex through the whole movie.

2729
02:00:21,610 --> 02:00:22,990
pull up that picture.
Sounds pretty good.

2730
02:00:23,250 --> 02:00:23,980
Great.
christie?

2731
02:00:23,981 --> 02:00:25,000
Christie brinkley,
bitch.

2732
02:00:26,170 --> 02:00:28,180
Disgusting me.
That's.

2733
02:00:28,730 --> 02:00:29,620
Yeah,
that's current.

2734
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:31,480
Okay,
and she's got to be how old?

2735
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:33,770
She's old her throat though.
Whatever.

2736
02:00:33,890 --> 02:00:37,980
Whatever it is to throw a little tuck.
This validates my nowhere.

2737
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:43,020
Scarf get her into horse riding.
I would make her drive in a convertible 

2738
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:44,440
and chase me around while I drove in a 
station wagon

2739
02:00:44,490 --> 02:00:45,600
up town.
Girl.

2740
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:50,640
Well,
if you compare the way she looks today 

2741
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:50,640
and the way she looked when she was with
billy joel,

2742
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:55,170
not that difference.
Compare the way billy joel looks today 

2743
02:00:55,170 --> 02:00:56,080
and the way billy joel looked when he 
was with christie brinkley.

2744
02:00:56,440 --> 02:00:59,320
I think she's a vampire.
She stole his soul.

2745
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,350
Do you think this threat things caused 
by cock?

2746
02:01:01,351 --> 02:01:03,590
Just tOns of and no,
bro.

2747
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:06,480
Your skin gets bad.
She's a $60.

2748
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:09,090
Most likely.
She's 60 years Old.

2749
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:10,910
Don't you?
Can't.

2750
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:12,060
You don't respond to them with.

2751
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:16,210
That's amazing.
She looks fantastic.

2752
02:01:16,590 --> 02:01:21,590
Absolutely.
That's as good as a 60 year old woman 

2753
02:01:21,590 --> 02:01:21,590
has ever looked in the history of the 
world and that's what I mean.

2754
02:01:21,590 --> 02:01:22,600
We're talking about exceptions.
When I say,

2755
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:24,460
yeah,
you're not looking at her and going,

2756
02:01:24,490 --> 02:01:26,050
oh,
she looks good for 60.

2757
02:01:26,051 --> 02:01:27,430
You're looking at her and goes,
damn,

2758
02:01:27,431 --> 02:01:29,260
she looks really good.
She's hot,

2759
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:33,220
she's hot,
and her body's really nIce too.

2760
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:35,800
Yeah.
Kristy full chevron,

2761
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:37,210
kapow,
kapow.

2762
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:38,980
I'll take it.
I'll take it all day.

2763
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:40,460
Yeah.
You make out with her.

2764
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:42,210
I'll check that throat cutter.
It's.

2765
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:44,840
It's not that bad dude or throw.
It doesn't look bad.

2766
02:01:44,841 --> 02:01:47,060
You're focusing on the wrong thing.
What do you.

2767
02:01:47,170 --> 02:01:49,980
You got to mirror bitch.
You're going to be very focused on that.

2768
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:51,800
Throat gutters.
Weird.

2769
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:53,300
Yeah.
It ain't that bad,

2770
02:01:53,301 --> 02:01:54,290
dude.
Come on.

2771
02:01:54,291 --> 02:01:55,700
She's hot as fuck.
You're out of your mind.

2772
02:01:55,701 --> 02:01:56,660
You look at their neck.

2773
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:01,960
You're looking at a still image just for
neck.

2774
02:02:03,530 --> 02:02:06,260
A little brian.
That's nothing.

2775
02:02:06,261 --> 02:02:08,300
You're saying nothing.
You're making noise with your face.

2776
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:09,950
You really frustrating me right now,
brian.

2777
02:02:09,951 --> 02:02:14,951
Yeah.
There's nothing going on with what 

2778
02:02:14,951 --> 02:02:14,951
you're saying.
You just fixating on next.

2779
02:02:14,951 --> 02:02:15,740
Next,
get a lot worse.

2780
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,120
Speaking in next,
there's a video that I tweeted today.

2781
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:25,360
It's fucking hilarious.
It's some climate change denier lady and

2782
02:02:25,941 --> 02:02:26,690
uh,
it's,

2783
02:02:26,691 --> 02:02:28,070
uh,
she's got a weird neck.

2784
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:34,360
Look at the picture,
look at the picture on my twitter and 

2785
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:37,301
you'll see what I'm talking about,
but it's the one of the dumbest Climate 

2786
02:02:37,301 --> 02:02:39,320
chaNge deNial videos I've ever seen in 
my life.

2787
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:41,570
For whatever reason,
I don't know what this is,

2788
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:46,840
but there's a lot of like I'm down home 
country type people to want to tell you.

2789
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:51,880
Climate change is a myth as well.
This is her.

2790
02:02:51,950 --> 02:02:52,680
See,
look at that.

2791
02:02:52,681 --> 02:02:54,530
Compare her neck to christie brinkley's 
nag.

2792
02:02:54,830 --> 02:02:56,570
I'll take christie brinkley's nap all 
day,

2793
02:02:56,571 --> 02:03:00,140
but play the play the video because it's
quite hilarious.

2794
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:03,660
It's so strange in fact,
that it's,

2795
02:03:03,661 --> 02:03:05,810
it's hard to believe that there's a lot 
of people like that,

2796
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:09,320
but she's going on about cold climate 
change.

2797
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:13,880
Kalama change is a myth.
Why are you so upset in my announcements

2798
02:03:14,110 --> 02:03:16,420
for congress here in Louisiana?
Progress.

2799
02:03:16,421 --> 02:03:16,590
It's

2800
02:03:16,610 --> 02:03:21,270
something very provocative.
I said that global warming is a hoax.

2801
02:03:21,570 --> 02:03:26,570
Naturally liberals in the lame stream 
media became unglued and attacked me in 

2802
02:03:26,621 --> 02:03:29,890
media,
but it's geOrge orwell wrote,

2803
02:03:30,150 --> 02:03:35,150
and that's why I'm of universal deceit 
telling the truth is a revolutionary 

2804
02:03:35,150 --> 02:03:37,920
act.
A specter is haunting America.

2805
02:03:38,510 --> 02:03:41,190
It is perhaps the greatest introduction 
into the history.

2806
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:47,900
It has been almost 10 years since failed
presidential candidate al gore put out 

2807
02:03:47,941 --> 02:03:50,760
his propaganda film the inconvenient 
truth,

2808
02:03:51,120 --> 02:03:56,120
proclaiming that the actions of 
america's energy industry are causing a 

2809
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:58,440
catastrophic rise in the earth's 
temperature,

2810
02:03:59,310 --> 02:04:04,060
quite inconveniently for al gore and for
the rest of the politicians who continue

2811
02:04:04,061 --> 02:04:09,061
to advance this delusion.
Any 10 year old can invalidate their 

2812
02:04:09,061 --> 02:04:13,170
thesis with one of the simplest 
scientific devices known to me,

2813
02:04:13,980 --> 02:04:18,980
a thermometer,
they get colder each year since the 

2814
02:04:20,041 --> 02:04:25,041
film's release.
God certainly has a wonderful sense of 

2815
02:04:25,041 --> 02:04:29,601
irony.
President obama knows it's getting 

2816
02:04:29,601 --> 02:04:32,991
colder,
was blame our recent economic growth on 

2817
02:04:33,151 --> 02:04:37,230
record freezing weather,
and then he turned around and launched a

2818
02:04:37,231 --> 02:04:42,231
new debate on global warming and the 
obama administration down is up.

2819
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:47,400
Two plus two equals five,
and ignorance is strength.

2820
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:52,530
Last summer and article reached the 
coldest temperature in recorded history.

2821
02:04:52,940 --> 02:04:56,550
There's record,
she eyes and a 60 percent rise of ice in

2822
02:04:56,551 --> 02:04:57,340
the arctic.
See,

2823
02:04:57,900 --> 02:05:02,220
polar bears have been forced out of 
their habitat because of overpopulation.

2824
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:07,400
Liberals for vas that global warming 
would cause an increase in severe 

2825
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:11,721
weather systems such as hurricanes,
and they blamed global warming every 

2826
02:05:11,971 --> 02:05:16,971
time these dangerous storms take place.
The experts agree over the last several 

2827
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:19,800
years.
Storms have decreased.

2828
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:22,800
Perhaps the biggest clue that this is 
one big scam.

2829
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:25,560
We swept under the rug by the lapdog 
medium.

2830
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:31,010
A computer hacker obtained access to the
mail server at the climate research 

2831
02:05:31,010 --> 02:05:35,631
center of east anglia in the uk and 
downloaded over 1000 emails proving 

2832
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:42,260
without a shadow of a doubt that these 
so called scientists had falsified data.

2833
02:05:42,690 --> 02:05:47,490
That conspiracy of global warming has 
had a devastating effect on the american

2834
02:05:47,491 --> 02:05:48,000
dream.

2835
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:53,360
The rise of modern society since the 
first refinement of crude oil in 18,

2836
02:05:53,731 --> 02:05:58,731
47 is no coincidence.
America's energy producers have fueled 

2837
02:05:58,731 --> 02:06:03,411
the industrial revolution,
which caused never before seen advances 

2838
02:06:03,411 --> 02:06:06,360
in living standards for the masses of 
ordinary people.

2839
02:06:06,810 --> 02:06:11,670
It was the burning of oil that energized
the foundation of a real middle class.

2840
02:06:11,671 --> 02:06:16,671
In the 20th century,
giving them access to new luxuries such 

2841
02:06:16,671 --> 02:06:19,560
as electric lights,
refrigeration and automobiles,

2842
02:06:19,740 --> 02:06:24,060
it was free market capitalism that 
created the wealthiest society the earth

2843
02:06:24,061 --> 02:06:29,061
had ever seen,
but now both capitalism and our energy 

2844
02:06:29,061 --> 02:06:32,510
industry are under attack and the hopes 
of global for dad.

2845
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:39,880
It's exhausting.
What the fuck you imagine if you had 

2846
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:41,520
that check over for a dinner party,
she just keeps.

2847
02:06:41,521 --> 02:06:46,260
She started hitting you with that garden
and she's reading off fucking cute cards

2848
02:06:46,290 --> 02:06:47,600
because that did not sound like her 
idea.

2849
02:06:47,940 --> 02:06:48,660
She was reading.
Well,

2850
02:06:48,661 --> 02:06:50,820
it might've been her ideas,
but she was definitely reading something

2851
02:06:50,821 --> 02:06:52,800
that was written out in advance.
I do notice,

2852
02:06:52,801 --> 02:06:56,070
and this is like total nitpicking,
but they're quoting this movie.

2853
02:06:56,071 --> 02:06:59,160
They're shitting on this movie an 
inconvenient truth.

2854
02:06:59,180 --> 02:07:00,390
Right?
They got the title wrong.

2855
02:07:00,870 --> 02:07:03,450
What is it?
They said the inconvenient truth,

2856
02:07:03,451 --> 02:07:05,730
and I know I'm nitpicking,
but like if that's your main argument,

2857
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:08,370
like you'd still.
It's weird that they're not going,

2858
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:09,900
they're not looking it up.
Well,

2859
02:07:09,901 --> 02:07:11,100
I have a theory.
What's that?

2860
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:12,660
I think she's dumb as fuck.
Yeah,

2861
02:07:13,350 --> 02:07:18,350
for sure.
And that was the best fuck but not 

2862
02:07:18,350 --> 02:07:18,350
available.
Right?

2863
02:07:18,350 --> 02:07:19,050
That was the best take they got.
So fuck it.

2864
02:07:19,051 --> 02:07:20,970
It's the inconvenient truth.
Dumb as fuck.

2865
02:07:20,971 --> 02:07:21,750
But not,
not uh,

2866
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:22,410
not,
not,

2867
02:07:22,411 --> 02:07:24,270
not available,
not aware.

2868
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:25,680
No.
She's dumb as fuck.

2869
02:07:25,710 --> 02:07:27,390
Right?
Like probably thinks she's pretty smart.

2870
02:07:27,570 --> 02:07:30,750
Absolutely.
God has a wonderful sense of humor.

2871
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:34,490
Like a thermometer.
I like women.

2872
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:36,010
Obama was stressed out about the cold.

2873
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:38,980
Yeah.
He's very stressed out.

2874
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:44,820
He gets dressed out.
It's getting cold every year and he 

2875
02:07:44,820 --> 02:07:44,820
knows it.
Yeah.

2876
02:07:44,820 --> 02:07:44,820
Picture of him.
Obama knows it.

2877
02:07:44,820 --> 02:07:45,470
Right?
And,

2878
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:46,570
and again,
I love how they,

2879
02:07:46,571 --> 02:07:50,050
like they throw back to 100 years ago 
and they go,

2880
02:07:50,051 --> 02:07:51,760
look,
this worked 100 years ago.

2881
02:07:51,761 --> 02:07:52,720
Man.
What's the problem?

2882
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:57,750
The reason why ordinary people it raised
the life standard for ordinary people.

2883
02:07:58,930 --> 02:08:00,640
Ordinary people.
What's an ordinary?

2884
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:03,490
What's an ordinary person?
Ordinary.

2885
02:08:04,290 --> 02:08:07,160
Like she's like making a plea towards 
the ordinary.

2886
02:08:07,161 --> 02:08:08,270
Yeah.
Plead,

2887
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:10,570
plead towards the mediocre,
like me.

2888
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:15,870
Mediocre small minded people with shitty
synopses like myself.

2889
02:08:18,490 --> 02:08:23,490
Yeah.
Regular americans anymore that bitches 

2890
02:08:23,490 --> 02:08:25,930
running for congress in Louisiana and 
she's going to get elected.

2891
02:08:26,710 --> 02:08:29,860
You imagine she,
she's pro industry.

2892
02:08:29,950 --> 02:08:31,990
Do you know,
not understand what that means.

2893
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:37,810
That's what gives people jobs.
Full charge keeps America strong.

2894
02:08:37,811 --> 02:08:40,570
Right?
America is a bunch.

2895
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:43,590
I mean there's a bunch of great things 
about America.

2896
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:45,460
America is pretty awesome.
No burgers,

2897
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:51,240
but there's a bunch of dumb shit in 
America that likes to call itself 

2898
02:08:51,240 --> 02:08:51,940
America,
right?

2899
02:08:52,090 --> 02:08:53,890
You know,
american values,

2900
02:08:54,070 --> 02:08:59,070
american standards,
the free and it's people that have that 

2901
02:08:59,070 --> 02:09:03,571
sort of this kind of mentality,
this sorta just low voltage sludgy 

2902
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:09,160
sludgy.
Sloppy thinking.

2903
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:14,280
Yeah.
She's hot enough that she'll probably 

2904
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:15,760
get in just based on looks.
Pro chicks are highs.

2905
02:09:15,761 --> 02:09:17,800
Fucking Louisiana dude.
Oh that's great.

2906
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:21,320
Women are hot as fuck down there.
The chief got no chance with the.

2907
02:09:21,410 --> 02:09:23,290
If a hot one runs against her.
Oh yeah.

2908
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:28,340
Oh,
that's all she has to do is show up at 

2909
02:09:28,340 --> 02:09:28,340
like farmer's markets.
Talk to people.

2910
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:31,960
She's in.
So on hotness alone.

2911
02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:34,150
So what about what she's saying though,
where she's like,

2912
02:09:34,650 --> 02:09:36,580
it's,
it is colder this year and there are.

2913
02:09:36,581 --> 02:09:38,860
There is more ice in antarctica.
True.

2914
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:39,880
Okay.
Tell him no.

2915
02:09:39,881 --> 02:09:42,400
It's like everyone is global warming 
real.

2916
02:09:42,430 --> 02:09:44,410
Everybody's sure.
Everybody believes it's real.

2917
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:47,170
Yeah.
Everyone kind of brings their own facts.

2918
02:09:47,171 --> 02:09:52,171
The only arguments that I've heard at 
all that make any sense whatsoever is 

2919
02:09:52,171 --> 02:09:56,791
that human addition to global warming is
just one factor and that there's a cycle

2920
02:09:58,571 --> 02:10:01,390
that happens all the time,
but humans are accelerating that cycle.

2921
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:03,640
I've heard that argument.
That makes a lot of sense.

2922
02:10:03,970 --> 02:10:08,970
That means that makes more sense to me 
than humans have no effect on it and it 

2923
02:10:08,970 --> 02:10:11,650
makes more sense to me than humans are 
the cause of it entirely.

2924
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:15,100
I have a feeling that if you look at all
those,

2925
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:20,940
you know those when those guys do those 
core samples and they find out the 

2926
02:10:20,940 --> 02:10:23,791
temperature of a thousand years ago when
they start examining the earth and the 

2927
02:10:23,791 --> 02:10:26,280
crust for all these different layers and
some of them they can,

2928
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:31,320
they could tell temperatures and 
asteroidal impacts and all this 

2929
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:31,320
different things.

2930
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:32,410
It's pretty obvious that a bunch of 
stuff's been happening.

2931
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:37,680
We've ice ages come and go.
We've had hot spells when the dinosaurs 

2932
02:10:38,001 --> 02:10:43,001
were alive.
Apparently it was like a completely 

2933
02:10:43,001 --> 02:10:43,001
different atmosphere,
much thicker atmosphere.

2934
02:10:43,001 --> 02:10:47,320
I read this thing about they were trying
to speculate as to why the dinosaurs 

2935
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:51,281
were so large and one of the things was 
that it might have been because the 

2936
02:10:51,281 --> 02:10:52,580
atmosphere was different.
It was a thicker,

2937
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:57,080
more rich atmosphere that just naturally
facilitated larger animals,

2938
02:10:57,170 --> 02:10:59,150
larger creatures,
especially lizards.

2939
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:05,560
Global warming isn't real.
The global warming controversy is global

2940
02:11:06,531 --> 02:11:10,550
warming real.
What we know about global warming,

2941
02:11:11,390 --> 02:11:16,390
the skeptic society says it's real how 
we know global warming is real.

2942
02:11:17,210 --> 02:11:22,210
Human induced climate change.
Atmospheric carbon dioxide 

2943
02:11:22,210 --> 02:11:25,601
concentrations are higher today than at 
any other time in the last 650,000

2944
02:11:26,751 --> 02:11:31,751
years.
They were about 35 percent higher than 

2945
02:11:31,751 --> 02:11:34,721
before the industrial revolution.
And this increase is caused by human 

2946
02:11:34,721 --> 02:11:36,590
activities.
Primarily the burning of fossil fuels.

2947
02:11:36,830 --> 02:11:41,450
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas as 
our methane nitrous.

2948
02:11:41,451 --> 02:11:41,930
I'm gonna sneeze.

2949
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:46,410
What are,
excuse me,

2950
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:49,140
water vapor and a host of other 
horseshit.

2951
02:11:49,740 --> 02:11:51,270
So yeah,
it's global warming.

2952
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:52,200
It's real.
It's real.

2953
02:11:52,201 --> 02:11:52,920
Okay,
that makes sense.

2954
02:11:54,490 --> 02:11:57,210
I'm going with them instead of a.
That chick,

2955
02:11:57,270 --> 02:11:59,880
was it hard to accept that,
that things are gonna change?

2956
02:11:59,910 --> 02:12:00,590
Well,
you know,

2957
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:04,290
full charge at my church,
we have these discussions about the lame

2958
02:12:04,291 --> 02:12:09,291
stream media and trying to figure out 
why the lame stream media media 

2959
02:12:09,291 --> 02:12:10,890
continues to lotto America.
That's when she said lanes,

2960
02:12:11,940 --> 02:12:16,940
media.
You have to like at that point you've 

2961
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:16,940
got to go.
We can't just keep talking.

2962
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:19,170
We can keep talking.
You think that's acceptable?

2963
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:21,510
And she said like,
she was like shutting them down.

2964
02:12:21,930 --> 02:12:26,930
I'm putting them on blast to lame stream
media debt.

2965
02:12:28,630 --> 02:12:30,660
Imagine getting that lady high on 
mushrooms.

2966
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:35,550
Imagine taking her to the forest.
I'll just a bunch of guys,

2967
02:12:36,090 --> 02:12:41,090
not just guys.
That sounds like a bunch of people and 

2968
02:12:41,090 --> 02:12:43,050
everybody drag her along.
Yeah.

2969
02:12:43,051 --> 02:12:46,160
And then just listen.
We're just gonna get you gonna you gonna

2970
02:12:46,170 --> 02:12:49,380
eat these mushrooms with us and then 
we'll do whatever you want.

2971
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:51,250
Okay,
so we'll vote for you.

2972
02:12:51,270 --> 02:12:56,270
Will do whatever you want.
You just got to do this first we'll 

2973
02:12:56,270 --> 02:12:58,620
listen to you get real big fucking jar 
of them with apple sauce mixed in.

2974
02:12:59,060 --> 02:13:04,060
Look at it.
The joe rogan kinda hot in a weird 

2975
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:04,260
milfy.
Well I can look at is people's necks.

2976
02:13:04,261 --> 02:13:06,330
That's not even a real bro.
You photoshop that.

2977
02:13:07,570 --> 02:13:09,660
You did brian.
Brian,

2978
02:13:09,661 --> 02:13:11,430
you hit the volume.
Jesus christ.

2979
02:13:12,290 --> 02:13:16,220
You fucking.
It's like a big volume.

2980
02:13:18,030 --> 02:13:23,030
I'm jeff.
The headphone didn't affect the 

2981
02:13:23,030 --> 02:13:24,460
recording now just to add funds.
Use photoshop that you fuck.

2982
02:13:24,490 --> 02:13:26,980
No,
I didn't think we're stupid.

2983
02:13:27,010 --> 02:13:30,940
That's a vagina.
So luckily she swallowed a bow and arrow

2984
02:13:31,700 --> 02:13:31,820
that's

2985
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:33,970
going on in her neck.
Was a guy named merrill.

2986
02:13:33,990 --> 02:13:35,640
Heck no,
it's not.

2987
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:37,650
That's christy.
Is it real?

2988
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:39,060
It is.
No,

2989
02:13:39,130 --> 02:13:41,520
it is a real doctor that up.
Yeah,

2990
02:13:41,521 --> 02:13:42,570
of course it.
Did you fuck.

2991
02:13:43,230 --> 02:13:44,650
He thinks it's funny.
So I'm mature,

2992
02:13:44,651 --> 02:13:49,651
man.
He put a vagina on a woman's neck and a 

2993
02:13:49,651 --> 02:13:49,651
woman is running for congress.
First of all,

2994
02:13:49,651 --> 02:13:53,010
it's unpatriotic.
Regardless whether or not you agree with

2995
02:13:53,011 --> 02:13:54,390
her,
you will respect her.

2996
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:55,780
It's unamerican,
brian.

2997
02:13:56,820 --> 02:13:58,290
People.
There are people that believe that,

2998
02:13:58,590 --> 02:14:00,180
that you're supposed to respect that 
person,

2999
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:01,680
right?
You're not supposed to mock her.

3000
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:02,820
Right.
First of all,

3001
02:14:02,821 --> 02:14:04,950
she's a lady.
Second of all,

3002
02:14:04,951 --> 02:14:09,951
she's congress representative.
She's going to.

3003
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:11,730
She's going to become the president one 
day.

3004
02:14:12,450 --> 02:14:17,450
Imagine if that's where we went and we 
went full fucking full apocalypto.

3005
02:14:17,790 --> 02:14:22,790
I couldn't handle that climate deniers.
Just fuck it up so bad that the ocean 

3006
02:14:22,891 --> 02:14:26,140
start to boil.
Call a fish,

3007
02:14:26,141 --> 02:14:31,141
kid cooked.
We all have to move to the center of 

3008
02:14:31,141 --> 02:14:31,141
the.
We all have to live in South Dakota.

3009
02:14:31,141 --> 02:14:31,790
It turns out people can all live in 
south.

3010
02:14:31,810 --> 02:14:32,590
Yeah,
everyone,

3011
02:14:32,690 --> 02:14:34,110
everyone.
Everyone's.

3012
02:14:34,130 --> 02:14:36,600
That's all that's left.
Everything else is just hot water.

3013
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:44,060
We got to.
You got to go where it's really fucking 

3014
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:44,060
cold.
So Canada becomes the number one spot.

3015
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:46,140
All of a sudden there's only 20 million 
people in all of Canada.

3016
02:14:46,260 --> 02:14:47,040
That's wild,
huh?

3017
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:48,240
Yeah.
That's how I.

3018
02:14:48,990 --> 02:14:50,850
That's crazy.
I'm pretty sure that's right.

3019
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:52,680
Let's see.
How many people are in Canada?

3020
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:55,080
I'm pretty sure I read that.
How many people live in Canada?

3021
02:14:55,140 --> 02:14:58,410
Too much time in Canada.
What's great in the montreal?

3022
02:14:58,411 --> 02:15:02,460
That's fantastic.
And I've been to winnipeg.

3023
02:15:03,180 --> 02:15:07,080
Winnipeg is 34,
34 point 8 million people,

3024
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:09,060
so yeah.
What is that?

3025
02:15:09,061 --> 02:15:14,061
That's like la and 20 million las,
like $20 million.

3026
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:18,060
I bet it's like the west coast,
a best of the whole west coast.

3027
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:21,720
Have you took the whole west coast from?
Certainly from Mexico,

3028
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:25,740
but I mean from like san diego all the 
way up to Washington state.

3029
02:15:26,190 --> 02:15:29,480
Yeah,
I bet you would get 40 and so that's all

3030
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:30,910
Canada,
Canada,

3031
02:15:30,970 --> 02:15:32,010
the whole,
the whole thing,

3032
02:15:32,130 --> 02:15:32,480
right.

3033
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:36,360
The whole giant north America.
That's while it's cold.

3034
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:37,560
I mean it's cold.
What can,

3035
02:15:37,590 --> 02:15:39,960
what can I tell you?
None of global warming.

3036
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:43,040
That would really work.
Well,

3037
02:15:43,570 --> 02:15:47,220
we need to do you mean I have a friend 
who lives in northern alberta?

3038
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:52,300
Yeah.
And he just bought or he's looking at 

3039
02:15:52,300 --> 02:15:53,970
this land.
There's 160 acres for $70,000.

3040
02:15:54,090 --> 02:15:59,090
Wow.
Yet greenland might be like the new go 

3041
02:15:59,090 --> 02:16:01,020
to Hawaii place in the future or 
whatever that or Iceland or.

3042
02:16:01,070 --> 02:16:03,240
Yup.
If it's still not,

3043
02:16:03,241 --> 02:16:05,670
it was not under the ocean.
That's the problem.

3044
02:16:05,970 --> 02:16:08,940
You've got to really hedge your bets 
when you're going to do this whole,

3045
02:16:08,941 --> 02:16:11,460
uh,
when you're looking towards the future,

3046
02:16:11,740 --> 02:16:13,600
you know,
like you sit in the guy's office,

3047
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:15,120
there's a whole thing about global 
warming.

3048
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:20,240
It's an opportunity.
There's always an opportunity to 

3049
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:21,910
probably know there's someone out there 
loves prognostication.

3050
02:16:21,911 --> 02:16:23,250
I mean it's.
It's a tricky business.

3051
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:28,360
You've got to really speculate.
We a lot of people are going to drown 

3052
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:28,360
and there's a lot of bleeding hearts 
problem with that.

3053
02:16:28,990 --> 02:16:30,010
There was.
The people are going to

3054
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,050
drown anyway.
Okay.

3055
02:16:31,350 --> 02:16:36,350
What I'm looking at is what's going to 
be above ground and what we've come up 

3056
02:16:36,350 --> 02:16:38,260
with is nova scotia is much higher 
altitude.

3057
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:40,480
I got two words for you.
North pole.

3058
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:47,600
I'm listening to like a house 
overlooking the ocean that isn't

3059
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:50,190
there yet.
Okay,

3060
02:16:50,191 --> 02:16:52,800
well all we need to do,
my friend is getting permits.

3061
02:16:52,890 --> 02:16:57,890
Not only can I give you a permit,
but I can name a star after you sign 

3062
02:16:57,890 --> 02:17:02,720
here on this little star registries and 
they named a star after naming us star 

3063
02:17:04,981 --> 02:17:09,981
ftp.
You shut the fuck up program star named 

3064
02:17:09,981 --> 02:17:09,981
dr.
Yeah,

3065
02:17:10,290 --> 02:17:12,090
fucking saint nicholas

3066
02:17:12,670 --> 02:17:17,120
men should be st nick.
Saint nicholas,

3067
02:17:17,121 --> 02:17:19,700
the star for the price of a cup of 
coffee.

3068
02:17:19,701 --> 02:17:21,470
I bought my own store.
Twenty $5,

3069
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:26,680
$25 in the future.
We have the technology to go to all 

3070
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:27,980
these planets that they,
that they named and stuff,

3071
02:17:27,981 --> 02:17:31,180
and you actually get to own it based off
like a $29 purchase.

3072
02:17:32,220 --> 02:17:37,220
Planets.
Planets are rare and difficult to find 

3073
02:17:37,220 --> 02:17:37,220
stars.

3074
02:17:37,220 --> 02:17:41,030
There was enough stars that I think they
had the mean really fucking brilliant.

3075
02:17:41,880 --> 02:17:45,440
If you think how stupid people have to 
be that you use

3076
02:17:45,550 --> 02:17:49,430
pay someone to write on a piece of paper
that the star's name,

3077
02:17:50,670 --> 02:17:53,440
it's not your fucking star man,
and by the way,

3078
02:17:53,441 --> 02:17:55,200
that started to give a shit what you 
name it,

3079
02:17:55,720 --> 02:18:00,720
got permission from another person who 
doesn't have that permission named 

3080
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:03,070
fucking star to you start an explosion.
You just got your name,

3081
02:18:03,071 --> 02:18:04,480
dr.
You named a explosion.

3082
02:18:04,870 --> 02:18:09,870
Not only that,
it might not even be not even still some

3083
02:18:10,601 --> 02:18:13,780
of those lights that you see in the sky 
or from a million years ago.

3084
02:18:14,410 --> 02:18:16,990
Millions of years ago,
millions of light years away.

3085
02:18:17,170 --> 02:18:19,480
So the light that's reaching right now,
it might've already.

3086
02:18:19,481 --> 02:18:19,950
We've burnt

3087
02:18:19,950 --> 02:18:20,670
out.
Sure.

3088
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:26,120
My leg,
you might have blown out right when they

3089
02:18:26,550 --> 02:18:29,700
first figured out about those hyper 
novas sometime during.

3090
02:18:30,060 --> 02:18:32,040
I think it was like the early two 
thousands.

3091
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:36,270
They first want to say no,
no,

3092
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:36,660
no,
no.

3093
02:18:36,870 --> 02:18:41,870
That was when they first figured out 
that inside every galaxy was a black 

3094
02:18:41,870 --> 02:18:41,870
hole,
but they,

3095
02:18:41,870 --> 02:18:45,470
they came up with this new detection 
equipment and uh,

3096
02:18:45,471 --> 02:18:48,090
I forgot what year it was.
I should probably look it up while we're

3097
02:18:48,091 --> 02:18:51,170
talking about it.
But when did they invent hyper novas?

3098
02:18:52,110 --> 02:18:57,110
But they found out event discover 
hybridomas because he didn't vet them 

3099
02:18:58,050 --> 02:19:01,290
hyper.
This is where I get really dumb.

3100
02:19:01,350 --> 02:19:06,350
There's black holes and every galaxy you
said they believe that there are in 

3101
02:19:06,391 --> 02:19:07,530
every galaxy.
This,

3102
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:12,560
and this is a fairly recent.
Over the last decade they believed that 

3103
02:19:12,560 --> 02:19:16,560
it at the center of every galaxy is a 
supermassive black hole that is one half

3104
02:19:16,561 --> 02:19:19,230
of one percent of the mass of the entire
galaxy.

3105
02:19:19,230 --> 02:19:24,230
So the bigger the galaxy,
the bigger the black hole and that 

3106
02:19:24,230 --> 02:19:25,620
inside each black hole,
maybe another universe.

3107
02:19:25,830 --> 02:19:28,700
Okay,
that's fine.

3108
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:31,050
That checks out.
There's a bit of a mind fuck yeah,

3109
02:19:31,530 --> 02:19:32,840
a bit of a mind.
Fuck.

3110
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:34,550
Do you ever see that movie?
The black hole?

3111
02:19:35,170 --> 02:19:36,340
It was like a fake star wars.
Yeah.

3112
02:19:36,430 --> 02:19:38,630
Disney.
I don't remember that.

3113
02:19:38,631 --> 02:19:40,750
What was that like an imitation star 
wars movie.

3114
02:19:40,770 --> 02:19:41,660
Oh no,
it wasn't.

3115
02:19:41,661 --> 02:19:44,290
Yeah,
it was a raincoat robots in it.

3116
02:19:44,660 --> 02:19:49,660
Somewhat popular,
but obviously it wasn't as good as star 

3117
02:19:49,660 --> 02:19:50,300
wars.
You remember buck rogers?

3118
02:19:50,540 --> 02:19:51,630
Yeah,
that was the bottom.

3119
02:19:51,890 --> 02:19:52,500
Okay.
This is.

3120
02:19:52,501 --> 02:19:56,120
It was in 1990,
the 19 nineties that they figured it out

3121
02:19:56,260 --> 02:20:00,500
in 1998 paper suggesting a link between 
gamma ray bursts and young,

3122
02:20:00,501 --> 02:20:05,501
massive stars.
Formerly propo proposed the term hyper 

3123
02:20:05,501 --> 02:20:09,911
nova.
They had some sort of a measuring 

3124
02:20:09,911 --> 02:20:12,281
equipment and they were.
They were detecting so many explosions 

3125
02:20:12,281 --> 02:20:15,010
in the sky that they thought that there 
was a war amongst aliens thrill.

3126
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:20,040
It's just something that was actively 
being considered because all throughout 

3127
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:20,570
the day,
apparently like all day long,

3128
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:23,060
if you have the proper measuring 
equipment,

3129
02:20:23,210 --> 02:20:28,210
you can detect hyper novas that are 
taking place way out in the far reaches 

3130
02:20:28,210 --> 02:20:31,580
of the galaxy and what they are is 
they're stars that are blowing up,

3131
02:20:32,420 --> 02:20:37,420
so it's.
It's happening like all over the 

3132
02:20:37,420 --> 02:20:37,420
universe,
but these bursts are so strong.

3133
02:20:37,420 --> 02:20:39,140
If they're anywhere near us,
we'd be dead.

3134
02:20:39,340 --> 02:20:44,340
Right.
Like if they were at a nearby star or 

3135
02:20:44,340 --> 02:20:45,200
nearby solar system and it went hyper 
nova.

3136
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:47,480
That's a wrap.
That's a wrap.

3137
02:20:47,540 --> 02:20:50,960
That's a wrap for this whole galaxy.
All lives most likely dead,

3138
02:20:51,110 --> 02:20:52,010
right?
Yeah.

3139
02:20:52,110 --> 02:20:54,200
That's a good way to go.
A nearby hyper nova.

3140
02:20:54,230 --> 02:20:54,770
Let's.
Let's,

3141
02:20:54,830 --> 02:20:59,830
let's google what it would say nearby 
was dangerous of a nearby hyper over 

3142
02:21:01,010 --> 02:21:02,660
death.
Yeah.

3143
02:21:02,661 --> 02:21:07,661
I'm pretty sure.
I mean there's so many stars out there 

3144
02:21:09,140 --> 02:21:10,940
that I don't know if it would be.

3145
02:21:11,090 --> 02:21:13,910
It would be possible,
but if it.

3146
02:21:14,270 --> 02:21:17,030
I mean it certainly would be possible.
I don't know how likely it would be,

3147
02:21:17,031 --> 02:21:20,780
but.
But the numbers of stars are just.

3148
02:21:20,781 --> 02:21:25,130
It's insane.
Hundreds of billions just in our galaxy.

3149
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:27,590
Just.
I don't think he can even understand.

3150
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:29,330
I think it's just numbers,
right?

3151
02:21:29,390 --> 02:21:30,620
Yeah.
It doesn't make any sense to me.

3152
02:21:30,621 --> 02:21:35,621
I can't really.
Destruction of earth by a nearby 

3153
02:21:35,621 --> 02:21:36,830
supernova.
This is on the nasa page.

3154
02:21:38,060 --> 02:21:40,400
Be careful job.
You destroy the earth itself.

3155
02:21:40,401 --> 02:21:43,460
The sun will have to go supernova,
which it never will.

3156
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:48,760
If you're talking about life on earth,
then there is a detailed calculation of 

3157
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:50,810
the risks due to a nearby supernova on 
the web.

3158
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:51,380
Oh,
there's a.

3159
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:54,350
There's actually a thing that calculates
the risks.

3160
02:21:54,650 --> 02:21:59,650
The author concludes that a supernova 
has to be within 10 parsecs or 30 light 

3161
02:21:59,650 --> 02:22:03,821
years to be dangerous to life on earth.
That is because the atmosphere shields 

3162
02:22:04,521 --> 02:22:09,521
us from most dangerous radiation 
radiation astronauts into orbit may be 

3163
02:22:09,521 --> 02:22:13,160
in danger if supernova is within a 
thousand parsecs or soul.

3164
02:22:14,030 --> 02:22:19,030
So if they were up in space,
it would be a thousand parsecs,

3165
02:22:19,161 --> 02:22:23,130
so 100 times more.
So $300,

3166
02:22:23,131 --> 02:22:26,190
million light years,
or three light years rather.

3167
02:22:27,210 --> 02:22:28,680
Wow.
Crazy man.

3168
02:22:29,340 --> 02:22:34,340
No star currently within 20 parsecs will
go supernova within the next few million

3169
02:22:34,650 --> 02:22:38,430
years.
That's a relief.

3170
02:22:38,830 --> 02:22:41,010
I feel so much better.
That's my biggest fear.

3171
02:22:41,670 --> 02:22:43,590
That would be a motherfucker dude.
One day.

3172
02:22:43,591 --> 02:22:48,591
It all goes bright.
I listened to the lame stream media all 

3173
02:22:48,591 --> 02:22:48,591
day.
The lame stream media,

3174
02:22:48,591 --> 02:22:51,830
constantly paranoid of things.
They could call it a high pernova.

3175
02:22:51,831 --> 02:22:56,831
All.
What I know is it's angels coming was 

3176
02:22:56,831 --> 02:22:58,950
just latin berg.
When the angels come,

3177
02:22:59,430 --> 02:23:04,430
the satellites go down,
that god has a great sense of evil.

3178
02:23:05,550 --> 02:23:10,550
The lame stream media would want to 
believe that the supernovas are to be 

3179
02:23:11,821 --> 02:23:14,790
feared,
but god's plan includes all of us.

3180
02:23:14,820 --> 02:23:16,060
God's plan.
Amen.

3181
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:19,170
When is that going to go away?
I don't think it will.

3182
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:21,300
What is that accent going to go away?
Uh,

3183
02:23:21,460 --> 02:23:23,000
I think people love it.
I think they,

3184
02:23:23,001 --> 02:23:28,001
they,
they love it and they're going to keep 

3185
02:23:28,001 --> 02:23:29,331
it going as long as they can.
I think they should keep it going just 

3186
02:23:29,331 --> 02:23:29,331
for the chicks.
Yeah,

3187
02:23:29,331 --> 02:23:29,460
right.
For the chicks alone,

3188
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:30,210
it's the best.

3189
02:23:33,110 --> 02:23:35,160
It's the best.
It's the best.

3190
02:23:35,161 --> 02:23:37,290
Doesn't get any better.
But for dudes,

3191
02:23:37,291 --> 02:23:39,930
a little hickey.
I think if you're a country music fan,

3192
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:42,810
it could work if the guys gentlemen 
could work.

3193
02:23:42,811 --> 02:23:45,450
But if the gods explaining thermo 
nuclear power,

3194
02:23:45,480 --> 02:23:46,410
right,
were like,

3195
02:23:46,411 --> 02:23:49,510
what?
It's fucking hickey cock sucker.

3196
02:23:49,530 --> 02:23:54,530
Let's throw some harvard on there that 
we're working with fusion and the wife 

3197
02:23:56,211 --> 02:24:01,211
fusion works is we have the nuclear 
where you feel feel the water into the 

3198
02:24:01,510 --> 02:24:04,110
broads and it's create steam.
And then this thing,

3199
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:09,170
oh,
you shut this fucking guy up and get a 

3200
02:24:09,170 --> 02:24:09,170
real scientist in near get someone from 
harvard,

3201
02:24:09,170 --> 02:24:09,830
someone with a good,
good,

3202
02:24:09,870 --> 02:24:11,910
strong new england accent.
Exactly.

3203
02:24:12,380 --> 02:24:17,380
Listening to soccer.
But you listen to people from harvard 

3204
02:24:17,380 --> 02:24:17,380
scientists from harvard.
No boston accent whatsoever.

3205
02:24:18,050 --> 02:24:19,020
Yeah.
The transplants,

3206
02:24:19,021 --> 02:24:19,430
right?
No,

3207
02:24:19,560 --> 02:24:22,920
they're smart enough to know that 
accident sucks and it's going to devalue

3208
02:24:22,921 --> 02:24:24,730
all their arguments points.

3209
02:24:24,870 --> 02:24:29,870
Yeah.
The only time that accent doesn't suck 

3210
02:24:29,870 --> 02:24:29,870
because if you're drinking,
that's okay.

3211
02:24:29,870 --> 02:24:30,090
Yeah.
That is great.

3212
02:24:30,150 --> 02:24:31,350
I mean,
I love to listen to it.

3213
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:36,380
Yeah.
If you're drinking and you're hearing 

3214
02:24:36,380 --> 02:24:38,721
stories,
but if it's a judge he's about to 

3215
02:24:38,721 --> 02:24:38,721
sentence you and he's got a boston 
accent,

3216
02:24:38,721 --> 02:24:40,300
like it's going to be a big one mat 
full.

3217
02:24:40,670 --> 02:24:45,670
Please approach the bench when you have 
qa feed off of that road because you had

3218
02:24:46,411 --> 02:24:51,210
been drinking.
You violated the laws of weymouth,

3219
02:24:51,211 --> 02:24:53,950
Massachusetts.
Oh,

3220
02:24:54,510 --> 02:24:59,510
do you ever have that bill?
Every bill bird tell that story about 

3221
02:24:59,510 --> 02:25:01,821
how he in a court and I'm there reading 
his testimony and the cop asked him 

3222
02:25:02,041 --> 02:25:03,330
where is he going?
And he said,

3223
02:25:03,340 --> 02:25:06,240
fucking boston.
And he goes,

3224
02:25:06,530 --> 02:25:07,680
bill explained to like,
nah,

3225
02:25:07,681 --> 02:25:08,760
you know,
I'm from boston.

3226
02:25:08,761 --> 02:25:10,230
It's like a.
When you asked me,

3227
02:25:10,231 --> 02:25:11,630
I was just thinking when I was saying if
I like,

3228
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:13,830
ah,
fuck in boston,

3229
02:25:16,440 --> 02:25:18,390
I wasn't cursing like you think I was.

3230
02:25:18,660 --> 02:25:19,120
Yeah.
Like,

3231
02:25:19,230 --> 02:25:21,840
like it's like indignant statement.
Oh,

3232
02:25:21,850 --> 02:25:25,100
in trying to be rude as fuck.
Fucking boston.

3233
02:25:26,790 --> 02:25:28,920
They read that off a piece of paper at 
his court case.

3234
02:25:29,070 --> 02:25:34,070
That's so funny.
That's the problem with the word fuck 

3235
02:25:34,070 --> 02:25:34,070
that.
It's kind of the word us sometimes.

3236
02:25:34,110 --> 02:25:39,010
Yeah.
You fucking fucking fucking fuck.

3237
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:41,020
Fuck this guy.
This fucking guy.

3238
02:25:41,290 --> 02:25:43,330
You saw that on paper.
You'd be like,

3239
02:25:43,331 --> 02:25:45,500
this is a really angry person.
Right.

3240
02:25:45,730 --> 02:25:50,730
You know,
but it's just a guy with a bad 

3241
02:25:50,730 --> 02:25:50,730
vocabulary.
That's why twitter doesn't work,

3242
02:25:50,730 --> 02:25:53,020
man.
Context context.

3243
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:58,080
Absolutely.
Do you don't get context when you just 

3244
02:25:58,080 --> 02:25:58,080
read it?
No.

3245
02:25:58,080 --> 02:26:00,160
Even if you know the person you're 
reading from,

3246
02:26:00,220 --> 02:26:02,410
it doesn't always work.
Sometimes it works.

3247
02:26:02,411 --> 02:26:05,860
If you know the person you're reading 
from like rise and shine cock suckers.

3248
02:26:05,861 --> 02:26:07,750
When it comes to the show ideas.
Sure.

3249
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:09,010
You know,
at 6:00

3250
02:26:09,010 --> 02:26:09,850
AM and it's time to get up.

3251
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:11,860
Yeah.
You know exactly what that is.

3252
02:26:12,400 --> 02:26:17,400
Joey diaz did this thing recently where 
he was talking about being proud to be 

3253
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:18,180
an american.
It did like this,

3254
02:26:18,470 --> 02:26:23,470
this ramp,
and then they put the national anthem 

3255
02:26:23,470 --> 02:26:23,470
over it,
pull it up,

3256
02:26:23,470 --> 02:26:26,710
pull it up.
He did a rant with the national anthem.

3257
02:26:27,360 --> 02:26:29,200
He's like,
can you get me going?

3258
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:34,680
Put the fucking national anthem bond he.
Have you ever been up like crazy early 

3259
02:26:34,690 --> 02:26:36,030
in the morning and listen to it?
Yeah.

3260
02:26:36,050 --> 02:26:38,530
Well yeah.
And he's also up on twitter at like 5:00

3261
02:26:38,530 --> 02:26:43,530
AM.
He gets a break giving people music to 

3262
02:26:43,530 --> 02:26:43,530
listen to.
So he's done that.

3263
02:26:43,530 --> 02:26:47,760
He's always gotten up really early and 
he's always gone to bed really early to 

3264
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:48,250
try to call him joey at midnight.
Really?

3265
02:26:48,390 --> 02:26:49,300
Joe?
He's dead.

3266
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:51,790
He's asleep.
He's out cold.

3267
02:26:51,791 --> 02:26:54,070
So what time does he normally go to bed?
Does it show?

3268
02:26:54,071 --> 02:26:56,140
Leaves a shame on me.
He'll like if we do a 10:00

3269
02:26:56,141 --> 02:26:58,110
show who gets to bed at 1:00
in the morning to write,

3270
02:26:58,150 --> 02:27:00,430
but he doesn't like to do that.
He likes to be in bed by like 11.

3271
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:02,230
Huh?
I'm in bed by 11.

3272
02:27:02,231 --> 02:27:03,940
I'm in no danger.
Yeah,

3273
02:27:03,941 --> 02:27:06,510
he likes to.
He but he's american.

3274
02:27:06,770 --> 02:27:11,770
Okay,
so the fucking mexicans are taking your 

3275
02:27:11,770 --> 02:27:11,770
job.
The russians.

3276
02:27:12,110 --> 02:27:14,030
Armenians caught it.
The fuck out.

3277
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:18,710
Go down in this country is 240 fucking 
years old.

3278
02:27:18,740 --> 02:27:21,290
Correct?
Seventeen 76.

3279
02:27:21,590 --> 02:27:25,280
They became a country because we're bet 
play the fucking national anthem because

3280
02:27:25,281 --> 02:27:26,070
they got me fired up

3281
02:27:26,220 --> 02:27:31,220
140 fucking years we've been around.
We have a greatest fucking everybody.

3282
02:27:33,390 --> 02:27:38,390
But guess what?
Don't mistake kindness for weakness.

3283
02:27:39,570 --> 02:27:44,570
Fucking american.
And you've to get up of that little 

3284
02:27:44,570 --> 02:27:48,181
circle of friends who app that tell you 
don't go down there and not going to 

3285
02:27:48,181 --> 02:27:48,340
hire you.
They're not gonna.

3286
02:27:48,370 --> 02:27:53,370
Hire you fucking loser.
You're going to grab your fucking balls.

3287
02:27:53,770 --> 02:27:56,110
You're going to take this shit.
You gonna wipe your ass.

3288
02:27:56,340 --> 02:27:58,840
You're going to brush your teeth.
You're going to put gel in your head.

3289
02:27:58,841 --> 02:28:01,930
You gonna fucking whatever the fuck put 
mount Washington,

3290
02:28:01,931 --> 02:28:04,120
your fucking mouth and you're gonna.
Go down and you going to go,

3291
02:28:04,121 --> 02:28:05,500
listen,
I know you're not hiring,

3292
02:28:05,810 --> 02:28:07,720
but I'm the best mother fucked 
available.

3293
02:28:07,721 --> 02:28:09,970
Do you know why?
Because I'm a fucking american.

3294
02:28:09,980 --> 02:28:14,650
Okay,
fuck I am.

3295
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:18,140
I'm a fucking american mother.
Fuckers.

3296
02:28:19,850 --> 02:28:22,410
Fucking habits.
Tommy closed.

3297
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:28,070
When you fucking get it pops up.
You're a fucking american.

3298
02:28:28,250 --> 02:28:29,750
Stop.
Fucking whining.

3299
02:28:30,170 --> 02:28:32,560
I'm sick of you motherfuckers who onto 
him.

3300
02:28:32,580 --> 02:28:36,120
Forty years we've been slinging and 
you're still wondering about

3301
02:28:36,220 --> 02:28:38,620
the unemployment rate.
One unemployment rate.

3302
02:28:38,770 --> 02:28:41,010
It's only in your head.
You need deep.

3303
02:28:42,220 --> 02:28:47,220
I'm sorry.
After a weekend with a bunch of fucking 

3304
02:28:47,891 --> 02:28:49,780
gentiles get up.
It's monday.

3305
02:28:49,781 --> 02:28:51,430
It's a beautiful fucking dead to be a 
lot.

3306
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:55,010
I hope you don't live in an apartment.
If,

3307
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:57,250
if he does,
he doesn't care.

3308
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:02,280
I know.
I like how he just basically did with 

3309
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:02,280
like the jerky boys did.
He told you to do with the jerky boys do

3310
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:06,250
like I'm the fucking best run circles 
around you mother fuckers.

3311
02:29:06,670 --> 02:29:09,120
You got down there.
That works for me.

3312
02:29:09,310 --> 02:29:14,310
That's exactly what the jerky boys 
missed their time.

3313
02:29:16,210 --> 02:29:18,880
They did a movie and everything,
but the jerky boys that they had been on

3314
02:29:18,881 --> 02:29:20,300
the internet.
Yeah.

3315
02:29:20,460 --> 02:29:25,460
If the jerky boys came out today,
some of those fucking things would have 

3316
02:29:25,460 --> 02:29:25,460
millions of hits.
Yeah,

3317
02:29:25,730 --> 02:29:30,730
they.
But we had to pass those tapes around a 

3318
02:29:30,730 --> 02:29:30,730
morale.
Yeah,

3319
02:29:30,730 --> 02:29:34,471
that was one of my favorite things that 
ever happened was the jerky boys from a 

3320
02:29:34,471 --> 02:29:38,551
friend,
a friend would get it and somehow knew 

3321
02:29:38,551 --> 02:29:38,551
they would make a copy for you and 
they'd get you the jerky boys.

3322
02:29:38,551 --> 02:29:40,120
That's how became famous.
I bought it from a friend.

3323
02:29:40,121 --> 02:29:45,121
He goes,
I feel bad selling you this because 

3324
02:29:45,121 --> 02:29:45,910
after you listen to it twice,
you never going to listen to it again.

3325
02:29:46,270 --> 02:29:48,640
I've been quoting this shit everyday for
20,

3326
02:29:48,641 --> 02:29:51,130
25 years.
I fucking love the jerky boys.

3327
02:29:51,750 --> 02:29:53,470
Are we recording?
Yeah,

3328
02:29:54,250 --> 02:29:55,000
absolutely.

3329
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:56,820
Do.
They had some funny shit.

3330
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:58,890
Oh my god.
The one guy,

3331
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:01,440
one guy was really good.
The one guy was really good.

3332
02:30:01,441 --> 02:30:03,870
One that was okay with the other guy was
really phenomenal.

3333
02:30:03,900 --> 02:30:07,710
I don't know which guy was which,
but a really fucking funny stuff.

3334
02:30:07,740 --> 02:30:09,810
If you go back and listen to it today.
Laughs.

3335
02:30:09,900 --> 02:30:12,100
Yeah.
That was one of those things.

3336
02:30:12,101 --> 02:30:14,370
It was like,
what if you did pranks back then?

3337
02:30:14,371 --> 02:30:16,860
It was hard to get appreciated.
It was hard to,

3338
02:30:16,940 --> 02:30:19,170
you know,
to do something along those lines.

3339
02:30:19,171 --> 02:30:23,790
And then remember when jimmy,
jimmy kimmel had a tv show.

3340
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:25,590
Cranky anchors.
Yeah.

3341
02:30:25,620 --> 02:30:28,060
And he had puppets.
Puppets would.

3342
02:30:28,110 --> 02:30:31,410
Comics would do the prank phone calls 
and they would call it in.

3343
02:30:31,411 --> 02:30:33,570
Puppets would reenact it.
That's great.

3344
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:38,600
That was hilarious.
I totally forgot about the florentines 

3345
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:38,650
thing.
Was the best.

3346
02:30:38,690 --> 02:30:39,560
Was jim florentine

3347
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:42,150
the guy that goes,
yay,

3348
02:30:42,210 --> 02:30:44,620
I'm going to come to your store lady.
Where is it?

3349
02:30:45,140 --> 02:30:50,140
The answer was yes.
And he called everyone lady.

3350
02:30:51,390 --> 02:30:55,500
Whether you're a man or a woman,
how much to see air bud lady?

3351
02:30:55,710 --> 02:30:57,690
$5.
Yay.

3352
02:30:57,790 --> 02:30:59,530
That's brilliant.
That is.

3353
02:30:59,930 --> 02:31:02,130
That's hilarious.
That's hilarious.

3354
02:31:02,230 --> 02:31:07,230
And there's one more.
Mitch hedberg called up and wanted to 

3355
02:31:07,230 --> 02:31:07,230
join a guy's band.
That one's fucking phenomenal.

3356
02:31:07,360 --> 02:31:09,520
He called up and wanted to.
It was like,

3357
02:31:09,550 --> 02:31:11,980
you saw a want ad that was like,
we're looking for a guitar player.

3358
02:31:11,981 --> 02:31:12,870
And he called them say,
oh,

3359
02:31:12,880 --> 02:31:14,260
but I'm kind of a singer too,
man.

3360
02:31:14,300 --> 02:31:19,300
You know,
check out these goals to go right to 

3361
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:21,840
that one.
Yankers mitch hedberg band.

3362
02:31:21,870 --> 02:31:24,040
I think it's hard to find.
You'll find it.

3363
02:31:24,150 --> 02:31:28,480
He'll find it.
He knows he's not like youthful jacia.

3364
02:31:28,510 --> 02:31:29,880
No,
I give up after three seconds.

3365
02:31:29,881 --> 02:31:31,860
He's got magic fingers in a good sense 
of google.

3366
02:31:32,010 --> 02:31:37,010
Yeah.
I haven't even called a t and t to tell 

3367
02:31:37,010 --> 02:31:37,010
my internet's down.

3368
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:39,070
Mitch hedberg cranking.

3369
02:31:51,950 --> 02:31:53,540
I like how he's playing the character 
to.

3370
02:31:53,970 --> 02:31:55,730
Yeah,
you got to see this.

3371
02:31:59,510 --> 02:31:59,790
No.

3372
02:32:00,410 --> 02:32:02,240
Hey,
is jerry there?

3373
02:32:02,470 --> 02:32:02,910
Yeah.
Okay,

3374
02:32:02,930 --> 02:32:03,850
hold on for a second.

3375
02:32:04,870 --> 02:32:06,760
No,
is he there?

3376
02:32:08,370 --> 02:32:11,200
Is that you would just turn down your 
music.

3377
02:32:11,201 --> 02:32:12,850
That's why he put me on a whole.
Yeah,

3378
02:32:12,880 --> 02:32:14,020
exactly.
That's cool.

3379
02:32:14,021 --> 02:32:16,720
I thought I thought like you got a 
secretary,

3380
02:32:16,721 --> 02:32:16,990
so.

3381
02:32:17,960 --> 02:32:20,730
Oh really?
How about now?

3382
02:32:21,240 --> 02:32:22,480
No,
now I can hear you fine.

3383
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:27,620
Oh,
well I'm talking to the same level of 

3384
02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:29,530
man your.
Is that I'm a musician man.

3385
02:32:29,531 --> 02:32:31,260
I'm calling you up.
[inaudible] [inaudible].

3386
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:33,100
You're lookIng for some jam partners,
rIght?

3387
02:32:33,380 --> 02:32:34,250
Uh,
yeah,

3388
02:32:34,251 --> 02:32:36,500
actually what we're looking for is a 
singer.

3389
02:32:36,950 --> 02:32:39,890
Well yeah man,
I sing and I play guitar man.

3390
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:41,760
But you know what I'm saying is no 
problem.

3391
02:32:41,761 --> 02:32:43,400
And you know,
people put a mic up to my mouth.

3392
02:32:43,630 --> 02:32:44,540
I belt it out.

3393
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:50,060
Yeah.
Well we're looking for a real lead 

3394
02:32:50,060 --> 02:32:50,060
singer.

3395
02:32:50,060 --> 02:32:50,060
Well,
if you,

3396
02:32:50,060 --> 02:32:50,060
if you want me to say I have like a 
real,

3397
02:32:50,060 --> 02:32:50,780
you know,
I like to like,

3398
02:32:50,810 --> 02:32:51,200
yeah,
lIke,

3399
02:32:52,110 --> 02:32:53,810
you know,
what do you like?

3400
02:32:53,811 --> 02:32:56,750
That kind of thing.
I hate melody.

3401
02:32:56,751 --> 02:32:57,100
You know,
I,

3402
02:32:57,101 --> 02:32:58,820
I'm purely against melly.

3403
02:32:59,250 --> 02:33:00,580
Where,
where are you calling from?

3404
02:33:00,710 --> 02:33:02,630
I'm hannah.
I'm from my phone.

3405
02:33:02,690 --> 02:33:03,050
Yeah.

3406
02:33:03,210 --> 02:33:05,240
No,
I mean you live in nassau.

3407
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:06,030
Suffolk.

3408
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:11,240
I'm part of that.
I'm part of the suffolk death metal 

3409
02:33:11,240 --> 02:33:11,240
contingent.

3410
02:33:12,030 --> 02:33:12,830
The heavier stuff.

3411
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:14,070
Oh yeah.
The heavier,

3412
02:33:14,071 --> 02:33:14,820
the better man.

3413
02:33:15,810 --> 02:33:16,470
well,
if you want,

3414
02:33:16,471 --> 02:33:20,510
I'll take your name and number and if 
the other guys are interested we'll call

3415
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:20,940
you back.

3416
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:22,800
All right man.
But I know people,

3417
02:33:22,930 --> 02:33:24,610
I know people at mtv two,
you know,

3418
02:33:24,611 --> 02:33:26,620
so you should probably hook up with me.

3419
02:33:26,900 --> 02:33:27,720
What's your,
uh,

3420
02:33:27,810 --> 02:33:28,260
what's your name?

3421
02:33:28,580 --> 02:33:32,100
My name is mitch.
Mitch and I got long hair.

3422
02:33:32,600 --> 02:33:33,720
Okay.
Yeah man,

3423
02:33:33,721 --> 02:33:38,721
it's way past my nipples.
Well,

3424
02:33:40,340 --> 02:33:41,630
I don't have a phone right now.
You know,

3425
02:33:41,660 --> 02:33:46,660
I spent my,
I spent all my money on the distortion 

3426
02:33:46,660 --> 02:33:49,281
pedals and stuff.
You have to write a song about a 

3427
02:33:49,281 --> 02:33:49,281
unicorn.
No,

3428
02:33:49,281 --> 02:33:51,710
I wrote this kick ass.
I'm about a unicorn.

3429
02:33:51,720 --> 02:33:54,360
It's a unicorn.
Who has a story though?

3430
02:33:54,361 --> 02:33:59,361
Did I unicorn?
Goes through the ups and downs and then 

3431
02:33:59,361 --> 02:33:59,361
in the end

3432
02:33:59,361 --> 02:34:02,910
you didn't call you.
I'm just going to be rehearsing now so 

3433
02:34:02,910 --> 02:34:04,450
you know what?
Let's jam right now over the phone.

3434
02:34:04,950 --> 02:34:05,650
No,
I got it.

3435
02:34:05,651 --> 02:34:06,160
I got to go.

3436
02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:08,330
Okay.
Let's just play a tune right now.

3437
02:34:08,331 --> 02:34:10,440
Mean to you.
I got

3438
02:34:10,620 --> 02:34:12,160
it.
I got people in my house right now.

3439
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:13,570
Oh really?
Yeah.

3440
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:15,710
So call me in a week or so.
All right.

3441
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:18,020
Take it easy.
His

3442
02:34:18,170 --> 02:34:21,370
voice is just music to my ears,
man.

3443
02:34:21,460 --> 02:34:23,020
Yeah.
Well especially now.

3444
02:34:23,021 --> 02:34:28,021
So after he's gone,
he did other ones.

3445
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:37,500
He's doing bong hits on the cat.
Oh,

3446
02:34:37,510 --> 02:34:40,900
that's the end of it.
And what was the other one?

3447
02:34:40,901 --> 02:34:43,360
That jim florentine florentine.
His name is special ed,

3448
02:34:43,361 --> 02:34:45,100
I think.
Is that still legal?

3449
02:34:45,101 --> 02:34:46,750
Can you still do that?
Can you call people up?

3450
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:49,600
It used to be that you could do it as 
long as you did it in vegas.

3451
02:34:49,780 --> 02:34:51,340
Debts.
That's their loophole.

3452
02:34:51,370 --> 02:34:53,320
I don't know what the deal is now.
This show probably ruined it.

3453
02:34:53,321 --> 02:34:56,560
You know the show what crank crank 
wreck.

3454
02:34:56,580 --> 02:34:56,940
Yeah.
Great.

3455
02:34:56,950 --> 02:34:59,860
So I wOnder with it,
can I go?

3456
02:35:00,530 --> 02:35:01,450
Yes.
Um,

3457
02:35:01,610 --> 02:35:05,120
I'm trying to track a package that was 
supposed to be delivered to my sister

3458
02:35:05,660 --> 02:35:09,020
when was this boat to get to her 
address?

3459
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:13,180
But they didn't make their first 
attempt.

3460
02:35:14,360 --> 02:35:16,010
I think the character's name is special 
eD,

3461
02:35:16,011 --> 02:35:21,011
but that seems weird,
like she's calling them to try to get a 

3462
02:35:21,011 --> 02:35:21,011
package tracked and they're fucking 
around.

3463
02:35:21,011 --> 02:35:25,600
There's a couple of guys,
jim florentine and don jamison do this 

3464
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:28,721
thing called the touchstone terrorists 
and they have a number thAt a lot of 

3465
02:35:28,761 --> 02:35:31,320
people call as the customer service 
number and,

3466
02:35:31,520 --> 02:35:35,030
and they also do telemarketers.
So the people that call,

3467
02:35:35,031 --> 02:35:37,490
they think it's an actual customer 
service number.

3468
02:35:37,540 --> 02:35:38,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

3469
02:35:38,361 --> 02:35:43,361
I might be getting,
I might be getting some of that 

3470
02:35:43,361 --> 02:35:45,161
information.
We would have so many hands because it 

3471
02:35:45,161 --> 02:35:47,081
seemed like that's what she was dOing.
It seemed like she was calling like she 

3472
02:35:47,081 --> 02:35:47,081
had a real problem.
Right.

3473
02:35:47,081 --> 02:35:48,560
I've heard this one before and it's even
worse than calling somebody,

3474
02:35:48,561 --> 02:35:48,860
right?

3475
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:49,550
Uh,
yeah.

3476
02:35:49,810 --> 02:35:51,830
It's kinDa fucked up.
That's even worse.

3477
02:35:51,831 --> 02:35:56,831
Like if they're calling you,
they've got a real issue that needed to 

3478
02:35:56,831 --> 02:35:56,831
fix.
No.

3479
02:35:56,831 --> 02:35:57,560
Yeah,
you know a florentine does is he,

3480
02:35:57,580 --> 02:36:01,680
he just tapes every conversation and 
when telemarketers call him he,

3481
02:36:02,010 --> 02:36:04,550
he fucks with them so bad.
That's smart.

3482
02:36:04,580 --> 02:36:06,650
Yeah.
Well that should be totally legal.

3483
02:36:06,810 --> 02:36:07,610
Yeah,
that should be.

3484
02:36:07,910 --> 02:36:10,010
Yeah,
that should be the one tIme where you,

3485
02:36:10,020 --> 02:36:13,860
you could get away with stuff like that.
Just fuck with telemarketer.

3486
02:36:13,870 --> 02:36:15,950
Yeah.
That's a miserable job though,

3487
02:36:15,951 --> 02:36:17,540
man,
to make that job more miserable.

3488
02:36:17,541 --> 02:36:19,460
The people.
I can't imagine.

3489
02:36:20,010 --> 02:36:25,010
Hi belinda ad.
So you got air bud.

3490
02:36:26,910 --> 02:36:28,860
The video?
Yeah,

3491
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:30,400
I've got airbags.

3492
02:36:31,450 --> 02:36:33,250
Hey,
I love era bud.

3493
02:36:33,260 --> 02:36:36,620
Yay.
I want to come down there and get it.

3494
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:38,540
Okay.
Um,

3495
02:36:39,750 --> 02:36:42,350
do you have the shining?
We do.

3496
02:36:44,660 --> 02:36:47,310
Scared.
Can you,

3497
02:36:47,450 --> 02:36:50,090
can you take it out on his door before I
got there?

3498
02:36:51,560 --> 02:36:52,790
I can

3499
02:36:53,430 --> 02:36:57,210
all work and no blame.
Makes a dull boy.

3500
02:36:57,900 --> 02:36:59,300
oh.
Oh.

3501
02:36:59,710 --> 02:37:01,480
Steps,
steps,

3502
02:37:01,850 --> 02:37:03,620
steps,
steps,

3503
02:37:03,930 --> 02:37:05,790
steps,
biceps,

3504
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,550
biceps.
Okay.

3505
02:37:09,490 --> 02:37:10,840
Yay.
Yay.

3506
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:12,580
Yay.
Yay.

3507
02:37:14,130 --> 02:37:15,850
Yay.
Yay.

3508
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:16,790
Yay.

3509
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:23,350
I've got some other customers.
See or that I really need the help

3510
02:37:23,670 --> 02:37:25,330
and is in here.
Mr.

3511
02:37:26,350 --> 02:37:27,540
Oh okay.

3512
02:37:28,520 --> 02:37:29,840
Is it here?
Mr.

3513
02:37:29,980 --> 02:37:32,360
Know what this is.
This is someone,

3514
02:37:32,400 --> 02:37:37,400
you know,
someone took the soundbites and did 

3515
02:37:37,400 --> 02:37:38,090
their own prank phone calls.
That's why it's not that,

3516
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:41,300
you know.
Yeah.

3517
02:37:41,570 --> 02:37:42,950
That's why I was repeating all this 
stuff.

3518
02:37:43,010 --> 02:37:44,870
oh wow.
You sure?

3519
02:37:45,350 --> 02:37:46,350
I'm pretty sure.
Sure.

3520
02:37:46,460 --> 02:37:51,460
It wasn't just psychotic.
What seemed like it was just psychotic.

3521
02:37:51,680 --> 02:37:56,680
Yeah.
I think that was somebody else doing 

3522
02:37:56,680 --> 02:37:56,680
this using like a soundboard.
I don't know.

3523
02:37:56,680 --> 02:38:01,631
That would be a good call if you just 
did it like that because it was so 

3524
02:38:01,631 --> 02:38:01,770
crazy.
Yeah.

3525
02:38:02,460 --> 02:38:03,980
That was a big thing for awhile.
Pranking.

3526
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:05,160
Yeah.
You know,

3527
02:38:05,900 --> 02:38:07,070
not so much anymore.
No,

3528
02:38:07,071 --> 02:38:11,510
I used to do it without recording it.
Which is fucking sounds kinda dumb.

3529
02:38:11,660 --> 02:38:16,580
Did you ever see the one where the dude 
was walking up to people and he,

3530
02:38:16,581 --> 02:38:21,581
uh,
he's asking them if they want to kiss 

3531
02:38:21,581 --> 02:38:21,581
his ass.

3532
02:38:21,581 --> 02:38:22,790
He's like a donkey in his pocket.
Just saw that.

3533
02:38:22,791 --> 02:38:24,620
Do you want to kiss my ass?
Do you want to kiss my ass?

3534
02:38:25,010 --> 02:38:27,560
And this one guy sucker punches him and 
knocks him out.

3535
02:38:27,561 --> 02:38:31,310
Cold knocks his teeth through his lips.
Yeah.

3536
02:38:31,430 --> 02:38:35,180
The guy just,
he just loses all control of his body in

3537
02:38:35,190 --> 02:38:38,210
one second while he just got knocked the
fuck out.

3538
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:41,360
And I mean it was bad.
His lip like was torn.

3539
02:38:41,361 --> 02:38:46,361
His cheek was torn open.
You could see through his cheek to his 

3540
02:38:46,361 --> 02:38:47,540
teeth.
He got punched through his,

3541
02:38:47,541 --> 02:38:48,800
uh,
his lower lip.

3542
02:38:48,880 --> 02:38:53,880
Yeah.
The point where his teeth went through 

3543
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:53,880
his,
uh,

3544
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:53,880
his face.
Yeah.

3545
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:53,880
Yeah.
He,

3546
02:38:54,030 --> 02:38:55,730
he asked the wrong guy the wrong 
question.

3547
02:38:56,060 --> 02:39:01,060
Well,
the guy told him to back the fuck off 

3548
02:39:01,060 --> 02:39:01,790
and he was still like,
do you want to kiss my ass?

3549
02:39:01,791 --> 02:39:06,791
Like he thought he was being cute 
because he was getting filmed and then 

3550
02:39:06,791 --> 02:39:08,870
he was getting like people were calling 
fake because he wasn't mad.

3551
02:39:08,900 --> 02:39:11,900
Like when he was getting interviewed 
after,

3552
02:39:12,050 --> 02:39:13,040
you know,
they had a camera on him,

3553
02:39:13,100 --> 02:39:15,610
like he was on his way to the hospital.
He was all fucked up.

3554
02:39:15,630 --> 02:39:16,100
I'm like,
no,

3555
02:39:16,101 --> 02:39:17,600
that's bullshit.
He would be pissed off.

3556
02:39:17,601 --> 02:39:18,640
That guy punched him.
Like,

3557
02:39:19,490 --> 02:39:20,850
now he's an idiot.
Yeah,

3558
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:21,410
yeah,
yeah.

3559
02:39:21,411 --> 02:39:22,340
This things.
It's cute.

3560
02:39:22,460 --> 02:39:25,070
Not smart to begin with.
He thinks it's funny that he got knocked

3561
02:39:25,071 --> 02:39:30,071
out.
Do you ever see the one with the kid 

3562
02:39:30,071 --> 02:39:30,071
jumps out of a trashcan and the guy 
punches him?

3563
02:39:30,071 --> 02:39:30,071
Yep.
That's.

3564
02:39:30,071 --> 02:39:31,020
Whoa.
That's a classic animated gifts,

3565
02:39:31,710 --> 02:39:34,400
right?
So that's a classic one.

3566
02:39:34,420 --> 02:39:39,420
That's so great.
Someone needs to have that as their 

3567
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:39,420
avatar.
My message board.

3568
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:40,880
That's so funny.
They would pop up,

3569
02:39:40,881 --> 02:39:41,780
boom,
the gun with him,

3570
02:39:41,781 --> 02:39:46,781
when he'd go right back into it,
you should have video that somebody 

3571
02:39:46,781 --> 02:39:47,660
released that were like a.
It was like a mma fight or a small,

3572
02:39:47,690 --> 02:39:52,690
like a some kind of fight and then the 
judge starts beating up the two guys 

3573
02:39:52,690 --> 02:39:57,490
because he's tried to break them up and 
they wouldn't break up and then the 

3574
02:39:57,490 --> 02:39:58,040
judge just the referee starts just 
beating them up.

3575
02:39:58,740 --> 02:40:00,290
I'll find it for you.
I don't want to see it.

3576
02:40:00,350 --> 02:40:01,490
That's okay.
Yeah,

3577
02:40:01,670 --> 02:40:06,670
I'm sure it happens.
It's so great that we have so much 

3578
02:40:06,670 --> 02:40:09,101
footage of so much nonsense.
I saw bad worldstar one the other day 

3579
02:40:09,860 --> 02:40:12,410
where some guy knocked this guy out onto
the hood of a car.

3580
02:40:13,070 --> 02:40:14,100
He just steps

3581
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:16,770
up to this guy,
like the guy sitting there and he steps.

3582
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:21,800
He's like sitting next to a car and he 
steps up and smashes them in the face,

3583
02:40:22,140 --> 02:40:27,140
knocking them out,
cold the goggles flying back into the 

3584
02:40:27,140 --> 02:40:27,570
grill of the car and then crumbles and 
the other guy's yelling,

3585
02:40:27,610 --> 02:40:30,160
worldstar.
I was like,

3586
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:32,910
really?
Like the humanity.

3587
02:40:33,720 --> 02:40:38,720
There's a certain segment of the human 
race that doesn't give a fuck about the 

3588
02:40:38,720 --> 02:40:39,570
rest of the human race.
That's true.

3589
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:41,520
They really don't give a fuck.
That's true.

3590
02:40:42,180 --> 02:40:47,180
It's kind of scary and you could find 
that segment represented well on 

3591
02:40:47,180 --> 02:40:48,300
worldstar hip hop.com.
Absolutely.

3592
02:40:49,100 --> 02:40:52,050
They don't mind punching each other in 
the face or punching you in the face.

3593
02:40:52,070 --> 02:40:52,710
Yeah,
it's fine.

3594
02:40:53,100 --> 02:40:55,140
It's just part of life.
Did you see the one the other day?

3595
02:40:55,230 --> 02:40:57,450
I think bill burt tweeted.
It is a kid.

3596
02:40:57,690 --> 02:40:59,820
He's riding his bicycle.

3597
02:41:00,060 --> 02:41:03,600
He pushes bicycle punches.
His kid in the face,

3598
02:41:03,630 --> 02:41:05,490
jumps off the bike,
runs by,

3599
02:41:05,491 --> 02:41:07,620
punches his kid in the face.
Then jumps on the bike.

3600
02:41:07,660 --> 02:41:08,070
Yeah.
He goes,

3601
02:41:08,100 --> 02:41:10,350
jesus,
who's ghost riding his bike?

3602
02:41:10,590 --> 02:41:15,590
Sucker punched this kid in the face and 
then jumped back on the bike and 

3603
02:41:15,590 --> 02:41:18,180
runaway.
These little kids tried to sucker punch 

3604
02:41:18,180 --> 02:41:18,180
me one time in baltimore.
I was lifeguard and this pool really?

3605
02:41:18,180 --> 02:41:18,960
And they,
they came up,

3606
02:41:18,990 --> 02:41:20,850
they wanted to go swimming,
so they just walked up.

3607
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:22,230
They were like eight years old and they 
go,

3608
02:41:22,231 --> 02:41:22,590
hey,
come here.

3609
02:41:22,591 --> 02:41:25,380
I want to tell you something.
Dude goes to punch me.

3610
02:41:25,770 --> 02:41:27,630
I move out of the way.
They all jumped in the pool,

3611
02:41:27,631 --> 02:41:30,270
jump out and run away.
Whoa.

3612
02:41:30,750 --> 02:41:34,320
And that's actually the story.
Jump out and run away.

3613
02:41:34,380 --> 02:41:35,640
Yeah.
They just want to jump in the pool for a

3614
02:41:35,641 --> 02:41:37,890
second.
Did they show the kid picking on the kid

3615
02:41:37,891 --> 02:41:38,970
first?
Yeah.

3616
02:41:38,971 --> 02:41:41,070
At first there was here.
You could say the whole thing.

3617
02:41:43,990 --> 02:41:44,810
We don't see it,
brian,

3618
02:41:56,400 --> 02:41:59,440
so he rides off.
They got upset.

3619
02:41:59,470 --> 02:42:04,470
The smaller guy rides off on his bike.
He's also the one that used the n word 

3620
02:42:05,560 --> 02:42:09,450
and he turns around,
starts back down the road.

3621
02:42:09,500 --> 02:42:12,150
It seems like he planned this out.
I think it's playing.

3622
02:42:14,740 --> 02:42:19,740
It goes rides the bike.
He chases his bike and then jumps back.

3623
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,220
Either way.
That's the eight year old worldstar.

3624
02:42:28,280 --> 02:42:29,690
Yeah,
that's what that is.

3625
02:42:29,870 --> 02:42:31,460
That's where world start.
When he can knock people out,

3626
02:42:31,461 --> 02:42:36,461
yet he punched people.
They don't get desperately hurt like 

3627
02:42:36,461 --> 02:42:36,461
they do in the other video.
They just get mildly annoyed.

3628
02:42:36,500 --> 02:42:41,500
Yeah.
Part of it's more fucked up because you 

3629
02:42:41,500 --> 02:42:41,540
know they're eight,
but part of it's way better because they

3630
02:42:41,541 --> 02:42:42,770
can't do as much damage.
Right,

3631
02:42:43,100 --> 02:42:48,100
right.
Part of you knows they'll be doing that 

3632
02:42:48,100 --> 02:42:48,100
at 80.
Of course.

3633
02:42:48,100 --> 02:42:52,540
Of course,
if they could stick in that 

3634
02:42:52,540 --> 02:42:52,540
neighborhood,
they could stick it out.

3635
02:42:52,540 --> 02:42:56,380
They'll be doing something way worse.
That guy will be in a way better video 

3636
02:42:56,380 --> 02:42:56,380
10 years from now with a better bike 
too.

3637
02:42:56,380 --> 02:42:59,060
It's going to be like solar power,
you think?

3638
02:42:59,061 --> 02:43:00,160
So?
I did.

3639
02:43:00,170 --> 02:43:01,580
I saw a bike in a bike shop the other 
day.

3640
02:43:01,581 --> 02:43:06,581
Whether it was a vintage bike.
Do you know the people were in the 

3641
02:43:06,581 --> 02:43:06,581
vintage bikes?
Sure.

3642
02:43:06,581 --> 02:43:09,290
Is an old piece of shit bike and it was 
$5,000,

3643
02:43:09,530 --> 02:43:12,220
I believe it was this it just a regular 
bike shop.

3644
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:17,520
I went into get something for my kids,
getting little kid bikes and they had a 

3645
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:22,171
vintage bike and it was an ugly piece of
shit and then like rust was coming 

3646
02:43:22,511 --> 02:43:27,511
through the chrome,
the seat was kind of fucked up and the 

3647
02:43:27,511 --> 02:43:27,511
guy was like,
it's all original parts.

3648
02:43:27,511 --> 02:43:28,150
I was like,
what?

3649
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:31,960
Like how much is this?
The guy was like $5,000.

3650
02:43:31,961 --> 02:43:35,710
It's a classic of this is a class,
this is where something can.

3651
02:43:35,770 --> 02:43:39,220
Can I ride this car?
Like they're trying to do that same shit

3652
02:43:39,221 --> 02:43:43,000
that they do with like old cars.
Like if you buy at 55 chevrolet,

3653
02:43:43,001 --> 02:43:43,600
you go,
whoa,

3654
02:43:43,601 --> 02:43:45,880
original dash.
This is amazing.

3655
02:43:46,300 --> 02:43:48,520
But a bike,
a bike from that era,

3656
02:43:48,580 --> 02:43:50,080
oh my god,
that's worthless.

3657
02:43:50,081 --> 02:43:54,520
There's a whole bike culture that we're 
just not these guys,

3658
02:43:54,810 --> 02:43:57,550
they're just all about their bikes.
Brooklyn is insane.

3659
02:43:57,760 --> 02:43:58,540
Really?
Brooklyn,

3660
02:43:58,541 --> 02:44:00,370
New York,
everyone's got a bike real.

3661
02:44:00,370 --> 02:44:02,880
It's insanity.
Did they steal bikes?

3662
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:07,960
No.
There's like these expensive bike shops 

3663
02:44:07,960 --> 02:44:09,040
and there's all these bike paths and 
especially in williamsburg,

3664
02:44:09,041 --> 02:44:14,041
brooklyn,
it's a fucking scene and all these guys 

3665
02:44:14,041 --> 02:44:14,740
are into it.
Real hipster thing.

3666
02:44:14,741 --> 02:44:16,540
It's a hipster thing.
The hips are well,

3667
02:44:16,541 --> 02:44:18,340
that's a good thing for hipsters to be 
involved with.

3668
02:44:18,341 --> 02:44:22,540
At least it's going to get them outside,
get the hipsters exercised.

3669
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:24,650
I'm looking at bikes right now because 
my just,

3670
02:44:24,710 --> 02:44:28,960
I leave my bike outside and the weather 
is just destroyed my looking at bikes to

3671
02:44:29,140 --> 02:44:32,180
the actual ride or to just sit there and
take notes and write.

3672
02:44:32,590 --> 02:44:37,590
I like riding bikes,
especially on burbank because there's a 

3673
02:44:37,590 --> 02:44:37,590
lot of weird pass,
you know,

3674
02:44:37,590 --> 02:44:38,520
go to the cemetery or Michael Jackson is
all around there.

3675
02:44:38,770 --> 02:44:40,750
That'd be great for you dude.
Ride bikes.

3676
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:41,910
It's healthy.
Yeah.

3677
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:43,270
Yeah.
I knew a dude who,

3678
02:44:43,271 --> 02:44:45,690
uh,
he rode a bike to jujitsu every night.

3679
02:44:45,740 --> 02:44:48,400
Then he wrote home would do who would 
ride the bike,

3680
02:44:48,520 --> 02:44:51,280
train and then ride home and I was like,
that's got to be a lot of work.

3681
02:44:51,281 --> 02:44:51,850
He's like,
yup.

3682
02:44:51,880 --> 02:44:53,600
But it gets you in incredible shape.
Right?

3683
02:44:53,620 --> 02:44:58,620
You get used to pumping.
But I also think it's like the worst 

3684
02:44:58,620 --> 02:45:02,011
time to be breathing heavy when you're 
around break fumes and hurt is not that 

3685
02:45:02,011 --> 02:45:06,511
good.
Dust and hurts actually kind of bad for 

3686
02:45:06,511 --> 02:45:08,330
you to do cardio next to the traffic.
Yeah.

3687
02:45:08,400 --> 02:45:13,400
Yeah.
And it's not like you could take that 

3688
02:45:13,400 --> 02:45:13,400
bike through the fucking woods.
He can't,

3689
02:45:13,400 --> 02:45:14,200
not really mountain bike.
It's terrifying.

3690
02:45:14,201 --> 02:45:17,140
Riding a bike around la.
That is people are texting and shit.

3691
02:45:18,340 --> 02:45:19,960
Hadn't burbank burbank's.
Not even in like,

3692
02:45:19,990 --> 02:45:22,300
oh nobody texts in burbank and not even 
people,

3693
02:45:22,330 --> 02:45:24,250
but there's like no traffic in my 
neighborhood.

3694
02:45:25,290 --> 02:45:27,730
The tonight show,
there's something about the way jay leno

3695
02:45:27,731 --> 02:45:29,210
ran that room,
right?

3696
02:45:29,380 --> 02:45:31,840
That all that areas like super safe to 
drive.

3697
02:45:31,990 --> 02:45:36,990
Did you hear that?
What that book that's coming out all 

3698
02:45:36,990 --> 02:45:36,990
about jay leno's like past guests,
like all these,

3699
02:45:36,990 --> 02:45:41,440
like weird things that happen.
Like how like when a Jessica Simpson was

3700
02:45:41,441 --> 02:45:43,780
on,
she demanded a $15,000

3701
02:45:43,781 --> 02:45:48,781
haircut before she,
she got on and like all these weird 

3702
02:45:48,781 --> 02:45:52,801
things that people demanded.
I would bet there's a lot of that prima 

3703
02:45:52,801 --> 02:45:56,190
shit that went on.
I heard Jessica Simpson did like 30 

3704
02:45:56,190 --> 02:45:58,780
takes on the tonight show on time.
30 teachers song going,

3705
02:45:58,810 --> 02:46:02,470
kept going and they planned on editing 
the shit out of it was a song.

3706
02:46:02,830 --> 02:46:07,830
Uh,
you remember when her and her husband 

3707
02:46:07,830 --> 02:46:10,160
jay brow producer reveals a list guests 
most outrageous

3708
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:11,180
demands.
Oh,

3709
02:46:11,181 --> 02:46:14,360
jesus.
He's the guy who did it.

3710
02:46:14,450 --> 02:46:15,110
Michael moore.
Yeah,

3711
02:46:15,111 --> 02:46:20,111
he was the producer.
Michael moore threatened not to go on 

3712
02:46:20,111 --> 02:46:20,630
just before the show taped,
unless the producers at greed to areas,

3713
02:46:20,631 --> 02:46:25,631
homemade video.
He had us over a barrel and myths that 

3714
02:46:25,631 --> 02:46:25,631
he caved in but didn't invite more back

3715
02:46:26,330 --> 02:46:27,300
like,
huh?

3716
02:46:28,650 --> 02:46:29,800
Wonder what that was about?
Yeah.

3717
02:46:30,550 --> 02:46:33,850
quentin tarantino was drunk as fuck.
they,

3718
02:46:34,280 --> 02:46:37,930
they sent bill clinton a $12,000
custom bike,

3719
02:46:38,080 --> 02:46:40,090
uh,
after it was 2004 heart surgery.

3720
02:46:40,180 --> 02:46:42,400
Clinton kept the bike but never made his
appearance.

3721
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:47,540
How old was hilarious?
A sarah pailin as for a private jet to 

3722
02:46:47,540 --> 02:46:49,450
fly here from Alaska to burbank for 
2010.

3723
02:46:49,650 --> 02:46:53,110
Apparently it costs $35,000
and they gave it to her.

3724
02:46:53,240 --> 02:46:56,480
Oh my god.
Well that was probably a scoop back then

3725
02:46:56,750 --> 02:47:00,470
to get her 2010 when they first 
announced she's running for president.

3726
02:47:00,830 --> 02:47:04,370
So 2010 was when they first announced it
for the 2012 elections.

3727
02:47:04,371 --> 02:47:06,830
That means that right now we're about on
target,

3728
02:47:07,490 --> 02:47:08,840
right?
It's 2014.

3729
02:47:08,841 --> 02:47:13,190
So this year is when we're going to 
start seeing the real election rumblings

3730
02:47:13,250 --> 02:47:14,470
into next year.
Yeah,

3731
02:47:14,770 --> 02:47:15,710
yeah,
yeah.

3732
02:47:16,040 --> 02:47:18,130
Who's going to run for president?
I don't know.

3733
02:47:18,131 --> 02:47:21,860
We had a bushes were of that job.
Got a job.

3734
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:26,920
Yeah.
We've got a gentleman and he's been 

3735
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:27,200
quiet.
He secretly sneak in silently.

3736
02:47:27,980 --> 02:47:29,840
Stealthily sneak in.
Right?

3737
02:47:30,560 --> 02:47:32,080
Probably.
I'm voting for roseanna.

3738
02:47:32,290 --> 02:47:35,230
Roseanne barr.
I think she did last time.

3739
02:47:35,390 --> 02:47:36,830
She believes in chem trails,
but I love her.

3740
02:47:36,890 --> 02:47:37,970
Oh,
she.

3741
02:47:37,971 --> 02:47:39,950
I don't know if she doesn't even listen 
to that episode.

3742
02:47:39,980 --> 02:47:41,600
I explained it to her.
I hope she listened.

3743
02:47:42,530 --> 02:47:42,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

3744
02:47:42,961 --> 02:47:43,880
She totally believed in it.

3745
02:47:44,330 --> 02:47:45,950
Yeah.
So to crash.

3746
02:47:46,010 --> 02:47:47,730
Crash on the float lab yesterday.
Yeah.

3747
02:47:47,840 --> 02:47:52,840
He's big on chem trails to cam shows.
I've seen him in a sky as they always 

3748
02:47:52,840 --> 02:47:53,090
say.
I see them.

3749
02:47:53,900 --> 02:47:57,590
I see them.
It's because of their excellent point.

3750
02:47:58,250 --> 02:47:59,540
Who is?
Who else is running?

3751
02:47:59,570 --> 02:48:01,940
They got that a ted cruz guy,
right?

3752
02:48:02,060 --> 02:48:04,760
he's a republican.
That gets talked about a lot.

3753
02:48:05,240 --> 02:48:10,240
There's hillary clinton who just fucked 
up because she tried to say that they 

3754
02:48:10,240 --> 02:48:13,211
were dead brOke.
she was trying to pick a ploy to a 

3755
02:48:13,211 --> 02:48:13,700
poverty saying that when the bill got 
out of the office,

3756
02:48:13,701 --> 02:48:17,210
they were dead broke.
She never said that.

3757
02:48:17,480 --> 02:48:22,480
First of all because they made a lot of 
money during the presidency and on top 

3758
02:48:22,480 --> 02:48:25,130
of that they also had tremendous money 
coming in right afterwards.

3759
02:48:25,310 --> 02:48:27,860
He's made over $100,000,000
just in speaking.

3760
02:48:27,861 --> 02:48:32,861
Right.
Just speaking from then until now and 

3761
02:48:32,861 --> 02:48:32,861
then writing books and all that other 
jazz,

3762
02:48:32,861 --> 02:48:37,541
like for her to saY we were ted probably
for her to bitch and this fucked up 

3763
02:48:37,541 --> 02:48:38,990
wacky economy where people can't get 
jobs.

3764
02:48:39,320 --> 02:48:41,450
LIke everybody knows you're rich.
What are you crazy?

3765
02:48:41,550 --> 02:48:43,250
You're really talking about the time we 
were.

3766
02:48:43,550 --> 02:48:48,550
Oh,
we were dead broke and bill got out of 

3767
02:48:48,550 --> 02:48:50,441
the office for a whole hour until the 
first check came in until he did his 

3768
02:48:50,750 --> 02:48:55,750
first one hour speech for $189,000
for 40 minutes to talk and we're doing 

3769
02:48:56,721 --> 02:48:57,470
fine.
After that.

3770
02:48:57,770 --> 02:49:00,260
it seemed to be okay and everything was 
going to be all right.

3771
02:49:00,470 --> 02:49:03,650
First year he made about $80,000,000,
wrote a book.

3772
02:49:04,650 --> 02:49:06,860
They got money fucking coming out of 
their asshole.

3773
02:49:06,861 --> 02:49:08,780
Like,
what are you talking about it.

3774
02:49:08,820 --> 02:49:10,800
Oh,
when you're a guy like bill clinton,

3775
02:49:10,950 --> 02:49:13,240
people will always pay to hear you talk.
Yeah.

3776
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:15,390
That's what they do.
That's the lecture circuit.

3777
02:49:15,391 --> 02:49:20,391
They'll show up at universities.
Universities have fuck loads of money 

3778
02:49:20,391 --> 02:49:21,150
when it comes to things like that at 
all.

3779
02:49:21,390 --> 02:49:22,560
They use,
you know,

3780
02:49:22,570 --> 02:49:26,970
they have think about how many people go
to a major university and paid $20,000

3781
02:49:26,971 --> 02:49:28,200
or whatever it is for tuition.

3782
02:49:28,620 --> 02:49:30,690
That's a sIzeable chunk they give to a 
president.

3783
02:49:31,050 --> 02:49:32,730
Absolutely.
Um,

3784
02:49:32,820 --> 02:49:37,820
I mean,
I know if you could make a lot doing 

3785
02:49:37,820 --> 02:49:39,530
comedy,
I know you can make a real lot doing 

3786
02:49:39,530 --> 02:49:41,721
fucking if you're a former president.
My wife went to see giuliani speak once.

3787
02:49:43,170 --> 02:49:46,830
When he came to ucla.
it was like post September 11th.

3788
02:49:47,460 --> 02:49:49,860
Like,
what am I spend way post?

3789
02:49:50,430 --> 02:49:52,770
Because it wasn't that long ago.
Whatever it was,

3790
02:49:52,980 --> 02:49:57,980
it was a.
She said it was like the most boring 

3791
02:49:57,980 --> 02:50:00,021
fucking thing she'd ever seen her life.
She couldn't believe that anybody would 

3792
02:50:00,021 --> 02:50:00,021
pay to see it.
It was like there was no passion to it.

3793
02:50:00,021 --> 02:50:02,880
It was numb.
It was just saying nothing.

3794
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:07,530
And he just spoke for an hour about.
Was there any topic.

3795
02:50:07,620 --> 02:50:09,330
I think they always have topics,
you know,

3796
02:50:09,331 --> 02:50:11,010
maybe he had a book out oR something 
like that.

3797
02:50:11,270 --> 02:50:11,670
You know,
they,

3798
02:50:11,680 --> 02:50:15,690
they go on a lecture tour and they just,
they just spit it out.

3799
02:50:15,720 --> 02:50:20,250
Like with no Bull.
He mentioned public speaking without the

3800
02:50:20,251 --> 02:50:25,080
pressure of meeting get laughs.
Well then the problem is public speaking

3801
02:50:25,081 --> 02:50:26,910
without laughs,
it's usually pretty shitty.

3802
02:50:26,940 --> 02:50:31,940
Yeah.
Even like a lot of these guys that do 

3803
02:50:31,940 --> 02:50:31,940
lectures,
they tell fucking jokes.

3804
02:50:31,940 --> 02:50:32,820
They know.
They know.

3805
02:50:32,940 --> 02:50:35,920
Yeah.
Like you ever listen to ted talks a no.

3806
02:50:36,390 --> 02:50:37,580
Those ted,
those,

3807
02:50:37,660 --> 02:50:38,880
you know,
those things online,

3808
02:50:38,881 --> 02:50:41,940
those science talks where they discussed
the university even ever.

3809
02:50:42,060 --> 02:50:43,080
I don't think I've ever seen one.
No,

3810
02:50:43,081 --> 02:50:44,140
but they have jokes in them.
Right,

3811
02:50:44,141 --> 02:50:45,150
and missing out.
Yeah.

3812
02:50:45,180 --> 02:50:47,250
People always have humor.
Always break things.

3813
02:50:47,251 --> 02:50:48,060
Yeah,
exactly.

3814
02:50:48,510 --> 02:50:49,290
You're missing out,
bro.

3815
02:50:49,360 --> 02:50:51,120
You don't know about the ted.
I'll get on it.

3816
02:50:51,480 --> 02:50:52,680
It's kind of called it.
I'm off tour,

3817
02:50:52,681 --> 02:50:53,380
dude.
I'll get on.

3818
02:50:53,420 --> 02:50:55,080
I got free time.
They're very culty apparently.

3819
02:50:55,470 --> 02:50:56,280
oh yeah,
yeah,

3820
02:50:56,880 --> 02:50:57,630
yeah.
How so?

3821
02:50:57,870 --> 02:51:02,870
Well,
they want everybody who's speaking to 

3822
02:51:02,870 --> 02:51:02,870
sleep together in the same room.

3823
02:51:02,870 --> 02:51:03,900
Yeah,
like you would have to share a room like

3824
02:51:03,901 --> 02:51:08,901
say if you and I were speaking right,
you'd have to share a hotel room 

3825
02:51:08,901 --> 02:51:08,901
together because they wanted people to 
get to know each other,

3826
02:51:08,901 --> 02:51:10,860
wanting to forcibly like people with 
money.

3827
02:51:11,190 --> 02:51:13,800
Like eddie wong,
who's a famous chef from New York,

3828
02:51:13,801 --> 02:51:18,801
was speaking at a ted conference.
They wouldn't let him get his own hotel 

3829
02:51:18,801 --> 02:51:21,561
room.
They made him stay and they got mad at 

3830
02:51:21,561 --> 02:51:21,900
him when he came here to do our podcasts
instead of stay and,

3831
02:51:21,960 --> 02:51:25,440
and meet with all these other people 
because they have this 10 thing and when

3832
02:51:25,441 --> 02:51:30,441
they have the ted thing,
they meet like you have a bunch of ted 

3833
02:51:30,441 --> 02:51:30,840
fellows.
People paid for ted memberships and they

3834
02:51:30,841 --> 02:51:35,841
come to these things.
They want you to go to events and be 

3835
02:51:35,841 --> 02:51:35,841
there to talk with them and meet with 
them.

3836
02:51:35,841 --> 02:51:37,380
Huh?
It gets like super weird,

3837
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:41,430
super controlling and kind of,
and not just from one person.

3838
02:51:41,430 --> 02:51:44,250
We've heard that from a bunch of people.
Sarah silverman,

3839
02:51:44,251 --> 02:51:49,251
they pulled her on there because she's 
good because she was doing what she 

3840
02:51:49,251 --> 02:51:49,830
does.
Being a fucking comedian.

3841
02:51:50,290 --> 02:51:53,790
She was telling jokes and being funny 
and they're like disrespectful.

3842
02:51:54,780 --> 02:51:58,080
They censored graham hancock.
They pulled his thing down to,

3843
02:51:58,470 --> 02:52:01,380
they invited him to go on and he came on
and he told this,

3844
02:52:01,381 --> 02:52:02,670
uh,
this,

3845
02:52:02,671 --> 02:52:05,230
uh,
interesting story about psychedelics and

3846
02:52:05,231 --> 02:52:05,670
the,
uh,

3847
02:52:05,671 --> 02:52:09,490
they got upset and sensitive and because
they censored it got way more attention,

3848
02:52:09,510 --> 02:52:12,130
right?
It became hugely popular online.

3849
02:52:12,670 --> 02:52:17,670
It's hundreds of thousands of hits after
that and re replayed on a bunch of 

3850
02:52:17,670 --> 02:52:21,931
different youtube sites too because 
people were scared they were gonna try 

3851
02:52:21,931 --> 02:52:21,931
to pull it down.
Right?

3852
02:52:21,931 --> 02:52:25,510
So it's really good.
Really good videos that are kinda shady.

3853
02:52:25,630 --> 02:52:27,700
Some of them are great.
The way they run it.

3854
02:52:27,930 --> 02:52:28,640
It's the,
the,

3855
02:52:28,700 --> 02:52:31,090
the business is kind of shady 
businesses.

3856
02:52:31,220 --> 02:52:31,940
I mean,
look,

3857
02:52:32,170 --> 02:52:35,760
shady is first of all,
pulling things like there,

3858
02:52:35,870 --> 02:52:38,710
they're pulling it down for the graham 
hancock one.

3859
02:52:38,711 --> 02:52:43,711
Like he made a very,
very detailed argument against pulling 

3860
02:52:43,711 --> 02:52:45,910
it down and he wanted.
He demanded to know like,

3861
02:52:45,940 --> 02:52:48,120
what about what I'm saying is 
pseudoscientific,

3862
02:52:48,190 --> 02:52:53,190
please explain if you're,
if you're so concerned that you pulled 

3863
02:52:53,190 --> 02:52:56,461
down.
Like these are real things like talking 

3864
02:52:56,461 --> 02:52:58,921
about iowasca.
These are real beneficial things that 

3865
02:52:58,921 --> 02:53:01,291
people can experience.
The science behind the experience is 

3866
02:53:01,291 --> 02:53:01,490
real.
The history behind the experiences.

3867
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:03,790
Real document against it.
It's very interesting.

3868
02:53:03,791 --> 02:53:05,620
Yeah.
It's an ancient and it's his theory.

3869
02:53:05,621 --> 02:53:10,621
These are his theories about knowledge 
being gained from taking these 

3870
02:53:11,380 --> 02:53:13,960
psychedelics,
but they pulled him down.

3871
02:53:13,961 --> 02:53:17,350
But that the eddie wong thing is more 
disturbing to me that they told him that

3872
02:53:17,351 --> 02:53:22,351
they will not more disturbing but almost
more disturbing because they made him 

3873
02:53:22,351 --> 02:53:23,980
sleep with another person in a room 
together.

3874
02:53:24,040 --> 02:53:26,050
I think that's,
I don't like that.

3875
02:53:26,190 --> 02:53:29,350
I cool fucker you that I don't care for 
adults here,

3876
02:53:29,351 --> 02:53:31,270
you know,
get my own room if.

3877
02:53:31,410 --> 02:53:34,510
Especially the one thing,
if you didn't have the budget but if you

3878
02:53:34,511 --> 02:53:35,860
wanted to pay,
but you're like,

3879
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:37,840
no,
I want you to team up with this guy.

3880
02:53:37,841 --> 02:53:38,650
He's a,
you know,

3881
02:53:39,070 --> 02:53:44,070
nuclear waste detector guy from 
yugoslavia who's giving a speech.

3882
02:53:44,140 --> 02:53:48,310
I know this guy fart and fucking snoring
next to me.

3883
02:53:48,311 --> 02:53:50,740
This is stupid.
No privacy.

3884
02:53:50,800 --> 02:53:53,080
That's like a physical thing when you go
up and have to make a speech.

3885
02:53:53,081 --> 02:53:56,590
You want a little bit of relaxation,
a little bit of privacy beforehand.

3886
02:53:56,630 --> 02:53:58,120
Yeah.
Before we leave graham hancock,

3887
02:53:58,121 --> 02:53:59,170
put this on his,
uh,

3888
02:53:59,171 --> 02:54:04,171
his twitter today and I retweeted it.
Magic potion discovered with potential 

3889
02:54:04,171 --> 02:54:06,530
to end all wars.
It's a,

3890
02:54:06,580 --> 02:54:11,580
it's only a minute and a half,
but it's a youtube clip about when they 

3891
02:54:11,580 --> 02:54:13,300
dosed soldiers up in the 19 fifties with
lsd.

3892
02:54:13,740 --> 02:54:15,890
And you've ever seen that video?
None.

3893
02:54:15,900 --> 02:54:17,320
Ever seen the video,
but I've heard about this.

3894
02:54:17,321 --> 02:54:19,240
It's classic pull.
Pull it up brian,

3895
02:54:19,450 --> 02:54:24,450
and we'll wrap this bitch up and we'll 
go home with this because it's kind of 

3896
02:54:24,450 --> 02:54:24,640
hilarious.
It's hilarious that uh,

3897
02:54:26,750 --> 02:54:28,750
I don't know what year this was.
They did this,

3898
02:54:28,751 --> 02:54:29,050
I hope,

3899
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,800
a drink of water.
Given that the housewife.

3900
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:36,230
No.
Twenty five soldiers later,

3901
02:54:36,420 --> 02:54:38,470
the first effect of the drug became a 
pattern.

3902
02:54:39,400 --> 02:54:44,320
The men began to relax them to giggle.
But this man was more seriously affected

3903
02:54:44,680 --> 02:54:46,620
and had to be removed.
TheY exercise,

3904
02:54:46,810 --> 02:54:51,810
they're all up to 35 minutes.
One of the radIo operators had become 

3905
02:54:51,810 --> 02:54:55,770
incapable of using his set and the 
efficiency of the rocket launcher team 

3906
02:54:55,770 --> 02:54:56,980
was that impact.

3907
02:54:57,010 --> 02:54:58,160
They have rocket launches

3908
02:54:59,740 --> 02:55:02,190
attacking section had lost all sense of 
urgency,

3909
02:55:02,560 --> 02:55:03,680
noticed,
bunching,

3910
02:55:03,710 --> 02:55:08,710
and indecision is they enter the would 
occupied by the enemy almost 

3911
02:55:08,710 --> 02:55:10,010
immediately.
The section commander,

3912
02:55:10,020 --> 02:55:15,020
I tried to use a map to find the 
location of our headquarters and the 

3913
02:55:15,020 --> 02:55:16,490
prisoners escalade had to have the way 
pointed out to him.

3914
02:55:16,630 --> 02:55:20,630
Although he was in plain sight,
700 yards away over open country,

3915
02:55:21,740 --> 02:55:26,740
50 minutes off to taking the drug.
Radio communication had become 

3916
02:55:26,740 --> 02:55:26,960
difficult,
if not impossible,

3917
02:55:27,170 --> 02:55:29,510
but the men are still capable and that's
the stain,

3918
02:55:29,520 --> 02:55:34,520
the physical effort.
However constructive action was till 

3919
02:55:34,520 --> 02:55:37,690
attempted by those retaining a sense of 
responsibility in spite of physical 

3920
02:55:37,690 --> 02:55:39,980
symptoms,
but one hour and 10 minutes after taking

3921
02:55:39,981 --> 02:55:43,460
the drug was one man climbing a tree to 
feed the birds.

3922
02:55:43,940 --> 02:55:48,940
The troop commander I gave up admitting 
that he could no longer control himself 

3923
02:55:48,940 --> 02:55:49,400
or his men

3924
02:55:52,730 --> 02:55:54,980
and they're all laughing and shit.

3925
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
Self then relapsed into laughter.

3926
02:56:00,650 --> 02:56:02,450
Wow.
They're all his weapons.

3927
02:56:02,870 --> 02:56:06,170
Weapons on acid.
They didn't know about asset back then.

3928
02:56:06,171 --> 02:56:08,110
Full charge.
They know they didn't know.

3929
02:56:08,180 --> 02:56:10,430
They didn't know about the full charge,
that's for sure.

3930
02:56:10,460 --> 02:56:13,970
You could follow the full charge on 
twitter and you should and you will.

3931
02:56:14,120 --> 02:56:16,160
It is the full charge.
It's that simple.

3932
02:56:16,310 --> 02:56:19,640
And if you want to fucking get crazy and
spell his name,

3933
02:56:19,641 --> 02:56:24,641
it's f u l c h irin iron like the metal 
I r o n matt.

3934
02:56:26,930 --> 02:56:29,270
Full tron.
Thank you for having me man.

3935
02:56:29,271 --> 02:56:30,620
It's great brother.
Thanks for being on.

3936
02:56:30,920 --> 02:56:32,120
Good to see you again.
As always.

3937
02:56:32,380 --> 02:56:33,200
Um,
that's it.

3938
02:56:33,230 --> 02:56:36,680
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and james will be back next week.

3939
02:56:36,681 --> 02:56:41,681
Next monday.
In fact to day the sponsor was ting.

3940

3942

3943

3944

02:56:56,690 --> 02:56:58,670
we'll be back next week.
Enjoy your weekend.

3946
02:56:58,700 --> 02:57:03,700
Uh,
if I see you fuckers in vegas for the 

3947
02:57:03,700 --> 02:57:03,700
ufc,
say hi.

3948
02:57:03,700 --> 02:57:03,710
And a much loved big kiss.

3949
02:57:08,260 --> 02:57:08,730
Oh my god.
