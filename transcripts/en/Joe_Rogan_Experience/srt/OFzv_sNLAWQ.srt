1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,050
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,660
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

3
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,520
Every part of that same,

4
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,240
yeah,

5
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,800
it's the greatest scene
in a fucking horror movie.

6
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,260
I'll usually just go out and they
wake up or something or just changes.

7
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:36,860
But yeah,

8
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,681
it felt like Alan,

9
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,530
this kills you problems or breaking apart.

10
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,470
That seems like more like
what it would feel like.

11
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:44,451
Why is he,

12
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:44,811
I'm sorry,

13
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:45,644
I called your meatloaf.

14
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,180
He had his friend Jack had come back
from beyond the grave and it was all

15
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,550
covered in like rotten flesh news,

16
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:53,420
calling a meatloaf,

17
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,630
just having visions as he
was turning into a werewolf,

18
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,500
like leading up to it.

19
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,600
Uh,

20
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,433
yeah,

21
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,930
yeah,

22
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,261
yeah.

23
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:03,770
He was being visited by dead
people that the Werewolf killed.

24
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,950
So it was his friend Jack First,

25
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:09,950
and then it was until
the blood line is broken,

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,210
those people are stuck in like a purgatory
state and only the Werewolf can see

27
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:16,890
them and they're all just rotting.

28
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:18,980
And so they become like
these talking skeletons.

29
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,240
Wow.

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,840
Yeah.

31
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,720
And that's what we told you
when we get this beautiful.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,820
Let's do it right.

33
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,663
Three,

34
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,150
give me some great time.

35
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,930
I'm getting a full live life size
version of the Werewolf from the American

36
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,410
Werewolf in London.

37
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,243

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,250
that's one of the coolest fucking things
I've ever seen in my life that come in

43
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:44,084
here and get afraid.

44
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,760
We can only hope so

45
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,310
fucking long gun thing.

46
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,480
My kids going to hate it though.

47
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,780
So you see the other
guys I me from the movie?

48
00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,620
No.

49
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,390
What else did they do?

50
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,770
A full size jack.

51
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,220

puppet theater theater.

I do a version of him.

53
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:08,530
You know,

54
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,230
they made a coal Paris.

55
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,160
You had one of the greatest
horror movies of all time.

56
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,943
Great.

57
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,823
Great.

58
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,713
What's that?

59
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,180
Am I ready?

60
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,260

61
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:32,650

62
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm still going to these to Rick Baker.

63
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:34,834

69
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,081
God,

70
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:50,490

71
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,353
That's perfect.

72
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,010
Yeah.

73
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,070
Just enough to maybe

74
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,080
just making sure there's no Saunders.

75
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,281
It's not,

76
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:02,690
I guess got accurate.

77
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,960
That's so amazing.

78
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,153
Wow.

79
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,480
