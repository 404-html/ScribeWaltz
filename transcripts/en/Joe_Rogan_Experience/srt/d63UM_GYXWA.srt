1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,430
You've talked about the difference
between intelligence and wisdom.

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,350
Jason Clark,

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,190
you have talked about the difference
between intelligence and wisdom saying

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,430
intelligence isn't a shortcut to wisdom.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:19,791
Well,

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:20,624
let's,

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,950
let's point something else out,

8
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:22,280
man.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,010
Stupidity isn't a
shortcut to wisdom either.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,290
What is your definition of wisdom?

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,613
Okay.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,171
Well,

13
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:43,460
there's the Old Testament view.

14
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:45,980
That's the fear of God is
the beginning of wisdom.

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,293
That's a good one.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,080
I think wisdom is in part the willingness
to come to terms the knowledge of your

17
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:00,640
own capacity for malevolence.

18
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:01,474
That's wisdom.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,960
The the desire to rectify that.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,930
The wish to set the world on a pathway
that leads it closer to have it and

21
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:12,460
farther away from hell.

22
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:13,330
That's wisdom.

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,190
The humility to know that there's more
things that you don't know then that you

24
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:31,191
know and that you should be open to what
you don't know when people inform you

25
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:36,441
of it because it's better to learn that
it is to walk nose first into a wall or

26
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,540
blind folded off a cliff.

27
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,363
Okay.

28
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,950
The knowledge that you don't have the
right to be a judge of being without

29
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:50,940
having given it your utmost.

30
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,930
That's wisdom.

31
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,813
Wisdom.

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,953
What else?

33
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,810
The knowledge.

34
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,020
Wisdom is also the knowledge that hell
is real enough so that you should do

35
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:21,560
everything you can to avoid either
inhabiting it or producing it.

36
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,720
That's what I learned from,

37
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,640
from psychological analysis of
the history of the 20th century.

38
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,740
Hell's real enough and,

39
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,860
and you,

40
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,430
you're,

41
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,420
you're duty bound.

42
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,740
Let's say your honor bound,

43
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:40,730
you're ethically bound to do the opposite
of whatever produces those hellish

44
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:41,750
circumstances.

45
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:42,670
Okay.
