1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
Oh no,
go ahead,

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,700
click the button and we're waiting on
them.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,260
I'd hate for you to drop some awesome
knowledge and we're alive.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,820
That's it.
Steve Rinella.

5
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:11,910
The only hunting show ever in the
history of mediator or excuse me of

6
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,700
Netflix,
have meat eater.

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,050
That's a.
that's an awesome accomplishment,

8
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,700
man.
You're the first hunting with.

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,430
See,
I tell everybody that if you want to

10
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:23,250
watch a hunting show,
I feel like people watch hunting shows

11
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:23,761
and they go,
oh,

12
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:25,260
these shit.
What the fuck are these guys doing?

13
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:26,450
They're sitting around.
I go,

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,890
well,
look at that blue,

15
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,200
the size of this book,
my own.

16
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,490
This is amazing.
Your show is so different from all those

17
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,070
other shows like it belongs on something
else.

18
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,750
It belongs on like the history channel
or discovery channel or something more

19
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:41,850
mainstream.
So I'm glad that Netflix picked it up.

20
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,280
Oh Man,
I'm delighted they picked up 32

21
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:47,280
episodes.
I'm glad we got to this plugin part

22
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,390
right away.
Right away.

23
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,430
Yeah,
because if I turn people off and they

24
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:52,230
tune out,
they'll remember this man,

25
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,290
this is great.
I can just walk out the fucking door

26
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,580
right now.
Nobody episodes.

27
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,890
How many episodes have you guys done?
All told?

28
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,493
No,
no.

29
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,390
Have more than 75.
Way More than 75.

30
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:05,560
I think.
So there's sort of.

31
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:09,760
Just remember one day we had a little.
I remember one day I was having a drink

32
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,440
to celebrate us having wrapped number 50
and that was long time ago.

33
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,660
So we're way past that now.
Wow,

34
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,420
that's a good question.
It's a lot of weeks.

35
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,580
Upwards of 75.
It's a lot of weeks out in the field.

36
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,010
Yeah,
the hundredth.

37
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,460
Yeah.
We'll probably have a little party on

38
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:26,740
the hundredth episode,
but no,

39
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:27,820
it's been,
it's been great man.

40
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,130
I mean the Netflix thing is really just.
I mean it really,

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,430
you know,
exposed to a lot of,

42
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,080
you know,
a lot of people and it was cool.

43
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:36,610
They instead of starting with season
one,

44
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:38,960
you know,
they put up season five and six a

45
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:41,590
Netflix,
which is nice because it makes people

46
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:43,120
real curious about the other ones.

47
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,210
There's one episode that's probably one
of my favorite episodes you ever did

48
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,540
where you never shot anything.
So one episode with you alone,

49
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,340
deer hunting.
And he started talking about your dad.

50
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,060
Yeah.
Cool.

51
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,480
Yeah.
Arizona area.

52
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,190
No music,
a lot of ambient sound,

53
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,290
loud wind who makes those choices,
like those editorial choices that was,

54
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,050
you know,
the Ed or one of our editors,

55
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,840
kind of one of our core editors,
the editors that's been doing it for a

56
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:11,060
long time.
A guy by the name of guy.

57
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,073
He,
um,

58
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,011
yeah,
he,

59
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:17,240
he did that.
And at first I was like,

60
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:18,074
Huh,
what?

61
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,161
Because he wanted.
Yeah,

62
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:20,960
he wanted to do one,
no music.

63
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,390
There's no vo on it,
you know,

64
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:26,900
and we're pretty vo heavy,
sound pretty tend to be a voiceover,

65
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,350
like I do a lot of narrating,
you know,

66
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,310
um,
in fact I was just writing some

67
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:38,240
narration for the United recently,
but I do a lot of narrating and then we

68
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,800
just did one with,
there's no narrating.

69
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,460
And I think a lot of times it comes down
to how talkative I'm feeling in the

70
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:44,880
field,
you know?

71
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,640
Um,
and yeah,

72
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:47,600
I just,
whatever,

73
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,930
for whatever reason I was suffering a
little bit of exhaustion or something.

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,440
I just did a lot of rambling.
And then when he started cutting it

75
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,420
together,
he just wanted to run it like that with

76
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,280
no sound at all.
We want to one night with no music at

77
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,114
all.
No,

78
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,530
no,
no voiceover,

79
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,180
no.
No narration.

80
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,520
Just all spoken to camera.
No other people there.

81
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,000
So everything just like not delivered
his dialogue,

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,240
just like two camera dressing.
We talk now about doing one that has no

83
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:16,480
words in it,
but it's all music maybe

84
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,030
I was looking for.
I was looking for like,

85
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,740
excitement to register on Joe's face and
I got the opposite.

86
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,150
Yeah.
Well that's one of the things that I

87
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:31,090
think is most ridiculous about a lot of
hunting shows.

88
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,360
Just how terrible the music is.
Some of the music choices.

89
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,190
Just like,
what did you guys just go to fucking,

90
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,770
uh,
what is that program that you have on

91
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:40,490
your Mac?
When is that a garage.

92
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:41,920
Garage band?
Yeah.

93
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,900
Pick up some beats and I don't know the
name of the system that we use,

94
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,430
but it's a,
you know,

95
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,670
it's,
it's a searchable database of music,

96
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:54,760
like a catalog of music.
The documentary we're doing,

97
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,830
we're,
we're beginning now to work on,

98
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:58,210
we're in the initial stages of,
you know,

99
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,780
having it scored,
which is fun because it's not something

100
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:02,980
I've ever messed with,
you know,

101
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,110
like I,
I think we're very rarely in a

102
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,350
television show or do you have a
television show scored,

103
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,130
you know,
you're usually using library music or

104
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:10,310
licensed music.
You know,

105
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,270
I was watching westworld the other
night,

106
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:14,890
which is an awesome show if you haven't
seen it.

107
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:17,320
But uh,
there was one scene with his music

108
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:17,890
started playing.

109
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,600
I'm like,
this is so bad.

110
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:23,020
I hate this.
I hate when I'm being manipulated by

111
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:26,200
music during a scene.
Like if the music is telling you to

112
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,990
where you're like,
where they come up to and they're like,

113
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:31,840
man,
you're not going to feel like this isn't

114
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:34,300
making you feel how we wish it made you
feel.

115
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,820
Perhaps if we played this,
you'll feel this way more.

116
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,330
Yeah.
It's weird that we just,

117
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,110
this is the part where you're supposed
to feel,

118
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,410
you know,
kind of like a feelings of nostalgia

119
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,880
and,
and you know,

120
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:49,720
and like these remorseful feelings and
we have no idea how to invoke that in

121
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,820
audiences.
But this musician did a wonderful job

122
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,660
some years ago.
Let's play this.

123
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,080
It's always like violins and shit,
piano,

124
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,390
it,
there's something about that that's

125
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:02,930
just,
I feel so manipulated,

126
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,550
like I should just get into it,
right?

127
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,380
Because you're accepting these are
stories of success of like,

128
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,440
you're,
you're giving me a program,

129
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,590
you're showing me something in an hour.

130
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,920
You,
there's all these edits.

131
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:17,440
We're going back and why can't I just
accept that,

132
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,320
you know?
Uh,

133
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,590
there's a,
there's a musician I liked quite a bit

134
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,870
named Micah p Henson,
and he's,

135
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,730
he's out at Abilene,
Texas and he has a song called the de

136
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,280
Texas sank to the bottom of the sea.
And a friend of mine who's a

137
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:33,100
screenwriter,
we have joked about someday writing a

138
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:36,970
movie.
So sad that you could play that song at

139
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:39,820
the end.
It would not feel manipulative like

140
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,230
movies.
So sad.

141
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:44,340
It could earn to have the day text,
the sank to the bottom of the sea,

142
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,000
played in the end of it.
What's his name again?

143
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,460
Mike?
A P hints and Micah and my ca.

144
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,170
Yeah,
a h,

145
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,730
a h?
Yeah.

146
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,410
Seems like a young fellow.
I don't know.

147
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,950
Seems like a young fellow.
He seems like he's got a background in

148
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:58,280
drug

149
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,440
taken a one of those guys.
Um,

150
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,190
but uh,
I really,

151
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:02,990
uh,
yeah,

152
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,220
he's a good musician,
man.

153
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,670
Yeah.
There's something about music in movies

154
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,610
that we've just totally,
we just totally accept it in television

155
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,760
shows and music when there's a scene and
they want to manipulate you and they

156
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:17,060
want to establish some sort of a feeling
that you're supposed to invoke.

157
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:20,660
They just lay it in there.
The radio head album.

158
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:23,570
OK.
Computer has a song called exit music

159
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:27,710
for film because I think they just felt
like it would be.

160
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,960
They're trying to send a message to the
licensers.

161
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,610
Yeah.
It's a wonder who was the first.

162
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:38,300
I guess they did that back in the movies
before there was talkies,

163
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,300
you know,
it was all when movies were silent.

164
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,890
I mean,
that's how they sort of manipulated you

165
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:45,800
and then they showed the screen and they
had the words on it that,

166
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,140
oh yeah,
like the Peter and the wolf thing and

167
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:52,420
then it just carried over.
But yeah.

168
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,770
Well we're working on the show with
music.

169
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,693
Um,

170
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,830
I've,
I've a hard time describing visual

171
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:01,664
stuff,
you know,

172
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,980
like I'll often see something like a
visual treatment for something,

173
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,170
you know,
or artwork or whatever.

174
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,161
I'm like,
I don't know.

175
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:11,720
I can't disappear.
I'll know it when I see it.

176
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:14,480
I'll know that I like it,
but I can't tell you what I like and

177
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:16,720
when we're doing it.
And I listened to music when the editor

178
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:18,470
is putting something together and I hear
music,

179
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,220
I never have suggestions.
I always just have no,

180
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,680
it's like,
it's me.

181
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:25,514
It's like,
it's like,

182
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,690
yes,
no,

183
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,381
yes,
no.

184
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,270
And I never could be like,
make it more,

185
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,130
you know,
I don't know,

186
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,020
I just had to hear it and I'd be like,
oh,

187
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:36,950
that's,
it's too heavy handed or not.

188
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,750
I saw one show where they were deer
hunting and there was electronic music

189
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:42,950
playing.
I was like,

190
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:43,940
who chose this?
Well,

191
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,190
they might be trying to create like a
weird tension.

192
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,900
Yeah.
Make you upset.

193
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah.
That way you want the deer to die

194
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,210
because they're forcing you to listen to
this music.

195
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,050
There's a great compilation of a hawks.
I think they're a rough legged hawks.

196
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:02,570
Maybe I can't remember what time,
but uh,

197
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,930
just bitch slap and Mallard ducks up in
Canada and the guy said it to hell's

198
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:08,110
bells now.
Always thought that

199
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,010
it was the obvious choice,
but just has a great effect watching a

200
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,770
hawks killed docs to hell's bells.
Um,

201
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,361
but other than that,
no,

202
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:23,130
I like it to be.
I always kinda like it to be not

203
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,660
obvious.
Like,

204
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,610
you know,
like let's say you're doing a show in

205
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,650
West Virginia and so on and be like,
oh yeah,

206
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,060
we kick it off of some Banjo music,
you know what I mean?

207
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,570
It's like I hate that kind of decision
making,

208
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,670
you know,
cliche.

209
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,530
Yeah.
And then,

210
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,730
and then I don't like it to be like
electronica to deer hunting.

211
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:45,840
Like you kind of want it to be sort of
like,

212
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,890
not obvious,
but.

213
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:48,120
Right.
Yeah.

214
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,390
Like who was it that decided to outer
space sounds the way it does,

215
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,930
like no one shows images of outer space
to Banjo.

216
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,050
Good point.
And show images of outer space like do,

217
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:58,310
do,
do,

218
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,290
do you know?
Or

219
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,740
it's gotta be like Star Wars,
symphony type music.

220
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,870
Someone decided to outer space feels
like a kind of music.

221
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,270
So if I was doing something about outer
space,

222
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:13,660
I would want to find something that
you'd never guess was outer spacey

223
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:17,470
sounding,
but in the end you're like,

224
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:18,304
yeah,
you know what,

225
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,910
that's not out of place for outer space.
Like a harmonica.

226
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,103
Sure,

227
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,830
sure.
I'll know when I hear it.

228
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,040
I hear it.
You'd have to enlist a bunch of the

229
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:33,000
world best harmonica players who come up
with something spacey.

230
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,980
Yeah.
That'd be to watch outer space stuff.

231
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,800
I think like a didgeridoo would work for
space now.

232
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:38,810
You could do that,
but that,

233
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:39,601
but the,
all the,

234
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:41,340
all the,
all the editors

235
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,180
all that music up for when they got to
cut to an Australia thing.

236
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,440
That's true,
right?

237
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,420
Really?
What's Australia sound like?

238
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,020
Oh,
that's right.

239
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,820
The degree do.
Um,

240
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,990
but yeah man,
Netflix,

241
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,250
it's,
it's a,

242
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,460
it's got a lot of emails and people kind
of stumbling out of the show and it's

243
00:09:57,461 --> 00:10:00,310
funny because you make a show about
hunting and you want to like in your

244
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:03,790
head you're like,
people that like to hunt would have

245
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,530
found it,
but then you,

246
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:08,020
you hear it from people who hunt their
asses off and they're like,

247
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,360
hey,
I just discovered the show

248
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,260
and it's,
and you realize this,

249
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,540
all these people,
like all the,

250
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,680
the untapped millions that are out
there.

251
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,240
Yeah.
Well there's a lot of people like me

252
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:23,210
before I ever started hunting that are
interested in it.

253
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,840
They think it's interesting and I think
the gateway drug for them as those

254
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:31,310
Alaska shows those like subsistence
hunter shows like the last frontier and

255
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,890
the mountain men chose.
They show these people are like,

256
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:34,880
wow,
that looks cool.

257
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,840
Yeah.
You know,

258
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:40,841
and then I think the next step is to
switch on over the sportsmans channel or

259
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:43,030
something like that.
And something interesting point.

260
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,470
But you can get turned off really
easily.

261
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:49,310
You could go to the wrong kind of show
and it can be boring or you can stumble

262
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:51,410
upon,
like I always say about uncharted,

263
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:53,090
the Jim shockey show.
Have you seen that show?

264
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,990
I have a great show and it,
to me it's not really a hunting show.

265
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,630
It's a show about cultures and travel
and culture.

266
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,090
Yeah.
It's about a really curious,

267
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,500
open minded guy who loves to go to
different cultures and he goes there,

268
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,690
you know,
and the premises.

269
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,920
He goes there to hunt,
but he's,

270
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,280
he's traveled to some really,
really incredible places and film some

271
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,760
amazing stuff.
Did you see the one where he went to?

272
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:18,740
Um,
I forget what river it was in Africa

273
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,220
where these people have a significant
problem with crocodiles eating.

274
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,470
Oh no I didn't,
but I've talked to some people about

275
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:27,330
that one.
Everybody in the village was like

276
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,600
missing an arm.
They had a hole in their head.

277
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,600
This.
Everybody had been jacked and while he

278
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:33,950
was there,
a woman got taken.

279
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,070
No,
it was crazy watching these people wail

280
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,410
and cry and sob.
It was really,

281
00:11:39,411 --> 00:11:40,790
really intense.
You know what?

282
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:41,624
I was in a

283
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,930
seventh grade.
We had a teacher named Ms Dot Merkel.

284
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,810
I don't know if she's alive anymore,
but I remember she lived down the

285
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:53,080
Muskegon river.
She was in the Peace Corps and one,

286
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,600
look at this.
What we'll see is the hands on your kid

287
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:56,710
and you realize later.
It's weird.

288
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:58,510
One day she brought in a photograph

289
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:05,050
of her,
I believe it was her fiance at the time

290
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:11,650
of his body after it had been removed
from a crocodile's stomach.

291
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,170
Holy Shit.
To show us

292
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,200
now to set that,
to set the times.

293
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,110
I also,
when I was in ninth grade,

294
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,920
there was a teacher named Mr Wright and
he wanted me to read blue,

295
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,110
a shotgun form.
You know the bluing on the shotgun,

296
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,330
like the coding on a shotgun and blew
it.

297
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,760
Yeah.
How do you do that?

298
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,200
What is it?
It's a chemical dip.

299
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,770
You Strip it and then it's like a
chemical treatment blooming blooming.

300
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,660
It's kind of fallen out of favor,
but everything used to be blue.

301
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,780
Anyways,
just set scene like for what you could

302
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:48,200
do back then that you don't do now.
He gave a shotgun to a kid,

303
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,630
brought shotgun school,
gave me the shotgun.

304
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,770
I took her home,
reboot it.

305
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,660
You know what?
He paid me back with what?

306
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,160
He gave me a 25 caliber semiautomatic
handgun in a sweat sock

307
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,560
school.
I brought it home and my dad confiscated

308
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:05,840
it from me and I never saw it again.
Wow.

309
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,200
So the teacher gave you a hand gun.
What the fuck is this teacher doing?

310
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:12,470
Give me that.
Yeah.

311
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,210
Wow.
Twenty five caliber.

312
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:18,770
Semi auto in a sweat soc as payment for
blue and his shotgun.

313
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,750
The transaction all happened at
[inaudible].

314
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,750
Is that in Michigan?
It's my high school.

315
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,730
So when I say the shadow,

316
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,890
she had a photo of a guy's body coming
out of a crocodile.

317
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:33,660
It's like just the,
you know,

318
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,940
that's not that long ago though.
No,

319
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,470
I'm 43 now.
How old am I?

320
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,020
40 two times have changed pretty
radically.

321
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:42,930
Oh yeah.
I remember when they instituted the rule

322
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:45,630
that you couldn't have firearms at
school and I remember going down and

323
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:50,250
talking to Mr Backman and being like,
hey,

324
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:50,701
you know,
and he's like,

325
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:51,391
oh yeah,
of course.

326
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:52,224
I mean,
you know,

327
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,180
you guys aren't

328
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,180
and everything
so you can stick a gun in your locker.

329
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:58,910
Have it

330
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,420
your car in the parking lot though.
Wow.

331
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,320
Now for our documentary,
we interviewed a guy who used to get on

332
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:09,670
his school bus with his shotgun,
Holy Shit in Martha's vineyard of all

333
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:13,270
places and he would get on the school
bus with the shotgun.

334
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,980
Wow.
So yeah.

335
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,330
So he could hunt ducks afterschool.
Whoa.

336
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,480
How old is this guy?
Old.

337
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,620
He's a Vietnam veteran.

338
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,000
Wow.

339
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,030
What happened?
What happened?

340
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:33,031
Started shooting people at school.
I don't know if we could answer that.

341
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,700
I've been talking about this a lot.
What happened to go and postal?

342
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,570
What did the post office figure out how
the post office get it together?

343
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,640
Like why did that stop happening?
Like was it.

344
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,340
It was a huge issue.
There was a game called postal.

345
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,650
There was a video game that you could
play in the early days of video game

346
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,100
called postal and this is another thing
that you probably couldn't do today,

347
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,860
but there was a video game based on mass
shootings.

348
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:00,170
We'd go to a post office just fuck
everybody up,

349
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,180
but was,
I don't remember.

350
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:02,900
I,
I know.

351
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,000
Of course I remembered that,
but I don't remember word.

352
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:09,770
They're actually like more than two.
Yeah,

353
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:11,510
I was going to say it's called running
with scissors.

354
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:15,500
Was the company that made it look like
this is the fucking game you would just

355
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:19,730
run around and shoot people and chop
them up and got them down.

356
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,550
I mean,
it's terrible graphics because it's the

357
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,740
early days of gun or excuse me with
video games?

358
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,330
No,
it looks like my six year old did the

359
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:29,930
pictures,
but this is the game and this is like

360
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:33,080
the original grand theft daughter auto.
Really?

361
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,110
Yeah.
How can we could just go over the roof

362
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:38,120
like that shitty ass physics.

363
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,900
Yeah.
I mean going postal was a thing that

364
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,570
people used to say all the time,
but if you said,

365
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,820
uh,
he went postal to like a tire now you

366
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,670
know,
people talk about.

367
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,390
I think people will use.
Use it as being.

368
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:56,290
You got real mad.
I think it's a murderous thing.

369
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,930
No,
I know.

370
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,230
But once it became in the lexicon,
you know,

371
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,630
you could say like,
Oh yeah,

372
00:16:01,631 --> 00:16:03,760
you know,
he went and posted all about me,

373
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:05,760
not,
you know.

374
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,630
Right.
Sending them the check.

375
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,090
But you could say going postal because
you're 42,

376
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,260
but could you say postal if you're 22,
I don't think a 22 year old.

377
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,120
Any idea what you're talking about?
Something happened.

378
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,240
It ended the,
the,

379
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:19,074
the,
the,

380
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,160
the phenomena.
Yeah.

381
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,590
What did the post office do?
Questioning is.

382
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,740
What was it based on?
Two things.

383
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,850
Three.
Monotony.

384
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,380
Inbox.
Outbox inbox outbox.

385
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:35,970
No.
Yeah,

386
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,803
but I mean,
I mean,

387
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,460
how many postal,
how many,

388
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:42,530
how many exam were there at post
offices?

389
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,410
Jamie's pulled them up here.
Look at this to a 19,

390
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,300
86,
1991.

391
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:52,000
Ninety one again,
two events in [inaudible] 93 and took a

392
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:55,480
13 year height and then it came back
strong in 2006.

393
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,800
Baker city,
Oregon,

394
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:58,990
2006.
So 2006.

395
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,330
It seems like that was the last postal
event.

396
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,200
Says that was based around these ones in
1986 is where the term started.

397
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:13,340
So it probably is just a novelty thing,
like one person did it and then a bunch

398
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:15,760
of other people.
Well,

399
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,800
I wonder if there's a disproportionate
amount of mass shootings and post

400
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:22,800
offices as compared to other warehouse
jobs or other.

401
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,410
I mean,
because there's been mass shootings at

402
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,350
work before,
but for some reason that distinction got

403
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:33,351
put on post office
said 35 people and 11 incidents that is

404
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:36,360
high.
It's fairly high,

405
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:37,601
but when you're,
you know,

406
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:40,440
you're dealing with the number of people
that come in and out of the post office.

407
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,370
Irate.
Yeah.

408
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,650
But it's one of those weird things.
It's like,

409
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,010
why don't you see that about Jiffy Lube?
There's no Jiffy Lube,

410
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:51,620
mass shootings,
you know?

411
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,740
Yeah.
I can't answer that.

412
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,310
I bet there's people who studied at
carefully.

413
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,830
I read the book,
I read the Book Columbine.

414
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,300
Oh yeah,
yeah.

415
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,320
You read that book?
No,

416
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,600
I didn't,
but I just got a book from one of the

417
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,460
kids that survived,
uh,

418
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,460
met him.
He was with Marilyn Manson at this

419
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:10,260
podcast that we did for the election
night,

420
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,230
the end of the world podcast.
And uh,

421
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,300
he gave me a copy of his book.
He survived,

422
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:18,090
they came up to him right before the
shooting and they said,

423
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:18,811
hey man,
we like,

424
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:20,280
you get the fuck outta here.
Really?

425
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,710
Yeah.
And he left and guns started blazing.

426
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,643
He survived.

427
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,133
Yeah,

428
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,720
that'd be a good guy to have on your
show.

429
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,020
I'm going to have them on the guy to go
to calm him by me.

430
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:33,150
The guy that wrote Columbine.
Columbine is a good book man.

431
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,920
I mean as far as the psychology of,
of,

432
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,030
you know,
the psychology and background and

433
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,420
context of shooters.
It's,

434
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,910
it's a good book.
It's an intense phenomenon,

435
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,730
you know,
that is attributed to North America more

436
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:49,290
than anywhere.
I mean you starting to see a lot more

437
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,380
mass shootings all across the world,
but a lot of them are religious related,

438
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,130
but it's,
it's,

439
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,390
it's a very,
it's a very confusing one to people

440
00:18:57,391 --> 00:18:59,190
because there's so many factors
involved,

441
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,650
you know,
and it's one that gets lumped in with a

442
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:02,680
gun culture.
Like,

443
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,500
this is a tweet that I put on my twitter
page while back that I said this country

444
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:10,080
has a mental health problem disguised as
a gun problem.

445
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,310
You know,
and I really,

446
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:12,720
really believe that.
I just,

447
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,590
I don't think you can attribute,
there's so many guns in this country and

448
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:19,440
so few mass shootings.
There's so many guns.

449
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,630
I mean the number of guns exceeds the
number of people and the amount of mass

450
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,980
shootings in relative.
Obviously they're all horrible,

451
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,170
horrific and terrible,
but relatively to the,

452
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,220
to the amount of people that we have,
it's relatively small.

453
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,840
I think that the kind of person that can
engage in something like that,

454
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,290
there's so many factors and you can't
blame it on guns.

455
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,330
It's like blaming forks on people,
getting fat.

456
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,900
It doesn't make sense.
You know,

457
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,280
like when you look at the tendency to
want to like grasp bond to somewhat easy

458
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,940
solutions for stuff,

459
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,630
it's something people go to.
Yes.

460
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,000
Because it's like,
it seems conquerable you know,

461
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,340
so people go,
people look at like a really complex

462
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:07,500
thing.
We saw so much this during the round of

463
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:09,430
the presidential election where,
you know,

464
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,550
to make a point really fast,
you look at something that's

465
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,250
terrifically complex and it's not just
that you want the magic solution,

466
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:18,090
but who would kind of go like,
well,

467
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,730
what could be pop,
what possibly could be done?

468
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,770
And I think people move in the direction
of moving in the direction of the second

469
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:28,560
amendment.
And there's also this sort of an

470
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,570
agreement that people have when
discussing it.

471
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,480
Like yes,
guns are a problem and that guns are a

472
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:37,080
problem because these things happen.
And then they all start talking about

473
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:39,660
guns and then if we get lumped into two
groups,

474
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:42,600
you get lumped into people that are pro
second amendment that go,

475
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:42,881
no,
no,

476
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:43,860
no,
it's not guns.

477
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:45,390
And then the people that say,
wow,

478
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:47,470
those crazy people with guns,
you know,

479
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,420
Obama.
That was one of the famous,

480
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,610
one of the famous statement that he said
during his administration is how people

481
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:56,530
are so attached to their guns and,
and the,

482
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:59,440
the second amendment people got so mad.
The NRA.

483
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,900
People like the cling into religion and
guns.

484
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,170
Yeah.
Yeah,

485
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,340
it's,
you know,

486
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,230
if you just look at the sheer number of
people who actually have guns in this

487
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:10,580
country,
it is a little crazy.

488
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,250
I mean the volume is very,
very high.

489
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:17,120
The actual number of firearms and the
thing that always gets me is they don't,

490
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,530
it's not like they stopped making them.
I mean they're making guns every day,

491
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,970
you know,
a lot less now since the election.

492
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,080
Really.
Yeah.

493
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:25,360
I had this trump white friends,
right.

494
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:25,450
Are

495
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,870
So convinced that um,
you know,

496
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,040
or like,
like most people in the country or

497
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,850
whether you liked it or not,
we're convinced that Clinton was gonna

498
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:35,720
win,
you know,

499
00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:36,554
and they,
they had,

500
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,710
I got it.
I got one friend in particular that went

501
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:42,200
out and bought a bunch of stocks for
company,

502
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,540
you know,
fire her companies and he said they took

503
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:48,440
a little hit after the election because
people are relaxed.

504
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,770
They didn't worry about stockpiling.
People aren't worried about stock pond.

505
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:53,620
I mean we were all talking about it is
like the,

506
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:54,454
the,
the,

507
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,310
the stockpiling thing is self
perpetuating.

508
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,550
Where when I,
when I was a little kid,

509
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,280
you know,
in our Christmas stocking we would get

510
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,970
bricks at 22 shells because we use 22,
we'd hunt small,

511
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:09,320
we'd done a lot of squirrels and
rabbits,

512
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,540
20 twos and it's just like you always at
22 shells,

513
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,010
you know,
you could go anywhere and get 22 shells,

514
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,540
a body mind one of our camera guys,
he grew up on a ranch and at the ranch

515
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:22,541
store they had two items chew,
so tins of chew in 22 shells that you

516
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:26,270
could get on credit at the ranch store.

517
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,820
The ranch store was a,
had a very limited inventory,

518
00:22:28,821 --> 00:22:32,030
but that's like how pervasive 22 shells
were.

519
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,850
Now when Obama won,
you know,

520
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:36,170
no one's going to use it.
Twenty two,

521
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,810
22 is not a goto caliber for,
for doing,

522
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,830
inflicting harm on other human beings.
It's,

523
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:42,081
it's,
you know,

524
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:45,020
it's just not a great.
It's a very small,

525
00:22:45,021 --> 00:22:48,110
small game round.
But the history about guns drove people

526
00:22:48,111 --> 00:22:52,280
to gobble up 22 animal.
So all of a sudden then it was you

527
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:55,100
couldn't find 20 to animal and not being
able to find it.

528
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:56,990
Like I used to just buy these little
boxes of 50,

529
00:22:56,991 --> 00:22:58,310
right?
It,

530
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,031
you go like,
oh,

531
00:22:59,031 --> 00:23:01,400
it's hard to buy it and then all of a
sudden you've gotten the need where you

532
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:04,250
wanted to buy all you could get because
it was in your head that you couldn't

533
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:08,270
get it.
So then you'd see a thousand of them and

534
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,250
I'd be like,
I'm going to buy it because everyone's

535
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:11,084
buying it.

536
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,080
And I think it was self perpetuating.
Now I got shitloads of 22 shifts.

537
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,210
But I was like,
I had no need for them.

538
00:23:17,211 --> 00:23:17,681
I just,
I,

539
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:20,440
I felt in this thing like there's this
thing that I've always had access to and

540
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,910
I won't have access to it,
you know?

541
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,340
And,
and it,

542
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,850
I don't know where it came from.
And I think that now all through the

543
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:30,950
last eight years,
there's been just this,

544
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,220
there's been this like great arming of
America because I feel like so many

545
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:37,200
people were worried about having their
rights and fringed it was like,

546
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,370
there's like,
at least now in that community of which

547
00:23:40,371 --> 00:23:42,140
I'm apart,
I suppose there's a,

548
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,900
there's a,
there's a sigh of relief.

549
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:46,010
You.
Yeah,

550
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:49,730
there's a great relaxation amongst
sports when they think that trump is

551
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,010
gonna come in and,
you know,

552
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,570
protect the second amendment rights.

553
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,570
But a lot of people got to do,
have to be worried about private land or

554
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,970
public land.
Yeah.

555
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,610
That's the thing that I'm really
watching.

556
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,530
Um,
and I'm curious about it,

557
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,670
you know,
at this point,

558
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,590
you know,
the talks over,

559
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,730
right,
the rhetorics over.

560
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:15,530
So now I'm a
for,

561
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,540
you know,
whether someone was forward or against

562
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:21,860
it for or against trump's victory.
I think now like the responsible thing

563
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:25,450
to do in my mind are the realistic,
responsible thing to do.

564
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,500
My mind is because there's so many
unknowns,

565
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:30,890
just approached the administration with
an open mind.

566
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,400
I mean,
you know,

567
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,031
be like,
now I'm like,

568
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:34,070
okay,
the talks over now like what's gonna,

569
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,140
what's gonna happen,
like what sorts of things that we're

570
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,440
going to see come out of it and I don't
know if anyone really knows the answer

571
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:43,441
to that and,
and like in my outward public facing

572
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:47,900
way,
I don't generally talk about politics

573
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:52,901
outside of issues that relate to
wildlife issues that relate to hunters

574
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:54,170
and fishermen.

575
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,780
Right.
Like I kind of focused in because I

576
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,740
politically,
I'm a mess,

577
00:24:57,741 --> 00:24:58,730
you know,
I'm all over the place.

578
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:03,020
Um,
I have no use for and I know you don't

579
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:05,120
either.
I have no use for like classic

580
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,090
definitions of conservatives,
liberals to just,

581
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,320
that shit makes no sense to me.
Like I don't get,

582
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,620
I don't draw my viewpoints from going
and looking and finding out how I'm

583
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:17,330
supposed to feel about it in order to be
like a consistent part isn't individual.

584
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,610
Um,
last January though,

585
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,590
uh,
for people who aren't even theirs,

586
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,230
I'm sure it's probably a lot of people
aren't familiar with this.

587
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,670
Can I get,
can I give a quick rundown on public

588
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:26,420
lands?
Yeah.

589
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:31,420
So the federal government has holds,
owns millions and millions of acres of

590
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,280
land in the US,
primarily in the western us.

591
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,950
And there's a handful of different land
holding agencies.

592
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,190
You have the bureau of land management,
manages lands,

593
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,700
the US fish and wildlife service manages
lands through the refuge system.

594
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,350
So when those boys,
uh,

595
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,080
in Oregon took over the wildlife refuge
there,

596
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:53,750
that was a,
that was actually,

597
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:57,440
um,
us fish and wildlife service land wasn't

598
00:25:57,441 --> 00:25:59,630
blm land.
You've got the national forest holds

599
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:03,620
Land National Forest Service,
which is under the Usta already said the

600
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:04,310
Blm,
right?

601
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,270
Yeah.
Um,

602
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,040
and then of course you have,
you know,

603
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,970
a states owned public land,
but the but the federal land management

604
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:15,440
agencies of which there are several hold
deed to millions acres land and,

605
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:19,280
and they wrap it is owned by the
American people and it's represented

606
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:21,860
through,
you might think of it as represented

607
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:25,040
through a trust and the trust is
administered by the federal government

608
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,190
on your behalf.
That's our public lands where people

609
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:29,160
recreate,
um,

610
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,270
oh,
another large holder of public lands and

611
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,770
National Parks Service.
I didn't mention that one.

612
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,400
A gene in the lower 48,
you don't,

613
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,960
you don't hunt on national park land,
you fish on national park land and you

614
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:44,400
generally haunt national land bureau,
land management,

615
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:47,270
land refuge land,
and uh,

616
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,990
there's a push right now to the people
feel that we should,

617
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,260
that the federal government should be
dumping a lot of federal land.

618
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,340
Um,
now the,

619
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,210
for what reason,
why you asked that,

620
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,930
that's what I'm good at.
So people get frustrated with dealing

621
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:08,130
with the federal bureaucracy.
And the reason that is,

622
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,160
is generally the feds are pretty.
I mean this is a gross generalization,

623
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:18,261
but generally the feds are pretty,
are much slower on exploitation of

624
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:21,450
natural resources,
less responsive to demand for

625
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:25,290
exploitation,
natural resources than state agencies

626
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,600
are.
So federal lands,

627
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,980
you know,
they're there.

628
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,000
They in exercising the will of the
American people,

629
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,820
federal land agencies are,
I'm

630
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,780
not as easy to deal with when it comes
to mining and development and other

631
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:46,170
issues as state agencies are.
So people who are,

632
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:51,230
who want to see a more readily
exploitable system in place for,

633
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,120
for developers,
miners,

634
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:56,700
loggers,
others will want to see like people able

635
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:59,370
to more readily make a buck off the
land,

636
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,430
they'd like to see these lands that are
federal lands,

637
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,390
they'd like to see him go into private
hands or like to see him go into state

638
00:28:05,391 --> 00:28:08,220
hands because they know that either way
it goes,

639
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:10,110
if they go into private hands or state
lands,

640
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,220
they're gonna have a much easier time
doing extractive industries in

641
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:15,750
development on those lands.

642
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,330
So that's what that's like under the
surface.

643
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:19,560
What's going on?
Um,

644
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,990
and then for instance,
like the guy,

645
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,370
you know,
one of the reasons the guys that took

646
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:24,870
over the refuge,
the,

647
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,200
a wildlife refuge in Oregon,
one of their gripes was they run cattle

648
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:32,450
on public property,
right?

649
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,460
So they pay a fee that one of those
families is heavily involved in running

650
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:42,801
cattle on federal land and they pay a
fee far below the going rate to run

651
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:47,260
cattle on public lands.
So this is what you'd go pay a branch,

652
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:48,780
or if you wanted to run cattle on his
land,

653
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:52,050
they pay about 10 percent of that by
some estimations to run it on public

654
00:28:52,051 --> 00:28:54,480
land.
And then when federal land managers

655
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:59,340
don't want to renew those contracts
because again,

656
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:01,220
because people are thinking about other
issues,

657
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,410
other uses for the land or whatever they
want to do with it,

658
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:07,320
it causes an intense amount of,
like a serious amount of frustration

659
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:07,800
with people.

660
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,210
So there's people don't want to dump
lands.

661
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,270
Now,
I heard Donald Trump speak,

662
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,490
uh,
last January,

663
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,520
so almost a year ago in Las Vegas,
and he was standing 40 yards away from

664
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:25,860
me and was talking about the that he has
no desire to see the,

665
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,530
he has no desire to see our public lands
privatized.

666
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,310
However,
um,

667
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,350
he's,
you know,

668
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,110
one might argue kind of by name only.
He's,

669
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,160
he's Republican.
I mean,

670
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:40,470
he's not.
He definitely hasn't demonstrated in any

671
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:42,910
sense of being beholden to party
orthodoxy.

672
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:43,540
I mean,
he's like,

673
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,110
he takes it issue by issue,
stance on things and doesn't really care

674
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:49,450
for how things are done at the party
level.

675
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,270
However,
his party is very much a,

676
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:53,070
you know,
they've,

677
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,820
it's,
it's right in there.

678
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,630
It's one of the planks of their platform
is right in their agenda to see us dump

679
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,690
federal property to see us offload
federal lands,

680
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,510
to see us offload American public lands
to,

681
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,310
into,
into state or private holdings.

682
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,631
So I don't know,
I,

683
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,940
I hope that he has good.
I hope he has luck and resisting that if

684
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,390
in fact,
if in fact he is still standing by that

685
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:15,520
statement that you made.
I don't think most people in America

686
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:19,870
understand how unique this situation is,
that we have these massive swaths of

687
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,910
public land.
No,

688
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,210
they don't,
they,

689
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,830
it's one of those things where,
and even the people that do,

690
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,320
even the people that know don't really
conceptualize,

691
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:31,760
like I grew up,
um,

692
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,990
I grew up about two and a half miles
south of the southern terminus of

693
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:41,020
manistee national forest in Michigan.
Uh,

694
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:47,010
a significant portion of our outdoor
activities took place on that national

695
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:48,460
forest.
We took it like,

696
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:49,450
it fell from,
like,

697
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:51,490
our perception of it was that it fell
from the sky.

698
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,870
It was that it just existed.
Um,

699
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,010
just had always existed,
we took it for granted,

700
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:01,330
like how you look at the sun and be
like,

701
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:03,040
the sun is just there,
you know.

702
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,100
So I think that even people who are
public lands users don't often don't

703
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:12,100
take the time to be like,
how is it that I'm able to be on this

704
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:16,420
land,
why I never considered it at all until I

705
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:17,620
hung out with,
you know,

706
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,330
but I,
but I'm saying I hung out on public

707
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:22,450
lands and it wasn't for,
it wasn't until I was,

708
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,020
you know,
it took me 25 years to start being like

709
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,820
not home.
It now what does this now,

710
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:32,140
this public lands you speak of that you
hold deed like the,

711
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:36,760
as an American citizen at,
in most ways as a global citizen because

712
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,960
our national for our public lands are
open to anyone American or not right?

713
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,930
But as an American citizen,
you hold deed to hundreds of millions of

714
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:47,440
acres of land.
Now there are conditions to your use

715
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,100
like just things you can and cannot do,
but you're free to roam camp,

716
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,640
Hunt Fish,
look at the stars,

717
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:55,930
whatever.

718
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:59,040
You're extraordinarily wealthy.
Um,

719
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,580
and these things that came about,
like they came out in various ways,

720
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:05,440
it's probably the most influential
person in creating the public land

721
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:07,810
system we have now is Theodore
Roosevelt,

722
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:12,700
and he was controversial in his time for
creating,

723
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,830
are for helping to create our public
land system.

724
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:20,340
He had the same resistance when he was
doing it from industry,

725
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:23,740
from extractive industry.
He had the same resistance that we have

726
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:28,360
now to public lands and then went and
chiseled his face on a mountain because

727
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:29,620
everyone,
like now everyone,

728
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:33,970
every politician would like to liken
himself to Roosevelt.

729
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,720
Right,
right.

730
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,430
He's like one of those dudes and you can
just be like,

731
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,840
like Teddy Roosevelt.
And people are like,

732
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:38,800
yeah,
positive feelings,

733
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:42,260
positive feelings.
He's achieved rushmore.

734
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,760
This was a guy who was like a radical.
You see a little bit of that with

735
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:47,690
Reagan.
Yeah.

736
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,220
During the Reagan administration during
the time where he was actually president

737
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:53,570
and massively polarizing figure.
Yeah.

738
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,310
People hated him.
I mean,

739
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,950
there was,
there was so much going on during the

740
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,660
Iran Contra hearings where it's like,
oh my God,

741
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,060
who is this asshole that we let run
president?

742
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,080
Yeah,
I think around the time,

743
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,530
like by the time he died he had to sort
of ascended to political heaven.

744
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,460
Yeah.
Right.

745
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,330
Now you can,
like,

746
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,930
Kennedy enjoys that position.
I mean,

747
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,800
Kennedy barely won the damn election.
Yeah.

748
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,830
It's,
it's debated whether he actually won

749
00:33:14,831 --> 00:33:15,290
the,
you know,

750
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,210
people say it all these volts wound up
in Lake Michigan.

751
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,000
Well there's a lot of fucking
shenanigans going on with that election

752
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:22,700
with the Mafia.
And that was a big part of how he got

753
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,960
elected.
So,

754
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,320
but later in life,
reluctant look back and say,

755
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,060
now there is a guy.
Right.

756
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:32,360
And so roosevelt creating our national
forest system.

757
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,030
Um,
yeah,

758
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:36,820
he was considered a radical.
Yeah.

759
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,930
It was like this outlandish idea,
like,

760
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,020
you mean to tell me you're just going to
take huge chunks of land.

761
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,560
They could earn some individuals an
extraordinary amount of money right now

762
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,890
and just set it aside for just joe blow
future person to enjoy.

763
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,700
And he even made a point where he went
on to say at one time that,

764
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,480
that he was doing it for those in the
womb of time.

765
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,703
Whoa.

766
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,320
Because at the time people were arguing
like,

767
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:09,480
okay,
if public land like,

768
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,110
because here's the other thing we
haven't that kind of pertains to this is

769
00:34:13,111 --> 00:34:17,190
wildlife in the Americas publicly owned.
It's not like most countries is not like

770
00:34:17,191 --> 00:34:18,840
that.
Like while leaving us is publicly owned,

771
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,420
so a deer.
If you've got a deer standing on your

772
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:22,680
neighbor's place,

773
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,260
you as not a federal citizen citizen,
but you as a citizen of your state owned

774
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:32,870
that deer.
That person can control access to it,

775
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:36,200
but it's not as deer.
He can prevent you from going up to it

776
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,450
because you can't go on his land,
but he has no more right to that deer

777
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:42,620
than you do generally speaking.
So when people said to Roosevelt like,

778
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,780
how are you blocking industry out of all
these lands and how are you blocking

779
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:50,840
industry from getting at the the
wildlife so we can sell the wildlife?

780
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:52,580
Back when we had commercial hunting,
he goes,

781
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,620
if you're,
if it's for the people,

782
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,790
give it to us,
and that's when he had his line.

783
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,541
He's like,
yeah,

784
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:02,030
but it's for the,
for those still in the womb of time.

785
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,300
That's deep.
That's deep.

786
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,120
People didn't like them.
I'm sure someone tried to do that today.

787
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,620
Dude.
He had a thing one time where he had a

788
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:10,970
timeline.
He had to.

789
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:11,840
He had to drop.
There was a.

790
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:15,170
There was an endo when he could.
He kept just throwing shit into national

791
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:17,300
forest for everyday.
That guy was an office.

792
00:35:17,301 --> 00:35:20,690
I think he saved about something like
50,000 square miles of land or

793
00:35:20,691 --> 00:35:23,390
something,
some sort of model and for everyday I

794
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:25,310
could be wrong with that,
but an absurd amount of land for

795
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:27,410
everyday.
He was an office and there's a thing he

796
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:31,070
did call the midnight forest where he
had a deadline that expired,

797
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:35,030
like his ability to keep drawing up.
Big Chunks of national forest was set to

798
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:37,950
expire at a certain time on midnight and
he was up

799
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,030
to last minute and midnight with a
couple aides marking up maps making

800
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:44,130
giant national forest and now we
celebrate them all.

801
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,320
Wow.

802
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,370
Right.
When they made.

803
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,080
When they made yellowstone also national
park,

804
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,880
people were pissed.
I'm sure mineral resources in their

805
00:35:52,881 --> 00:35:54,820
mental piss today.
Timber in there.

806
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,030
Yeah,
but I'm saying all these big decisions

807
00:35:57,031 --> 00:36:00,410
like these decisions happen,
did we create a public land system in

808
00:36:00,411 --> 00:36:03,530
America?
Like the decision happens generally

809
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:05,450
people look and go,
wow,

810
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:06,500
what foresight,
you know,

811
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,990
it's kind of this insane idea that you
would have a country is prosperous as

812
00:36:11,991 --> 00:36:13,970
ours,
you know,

813
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:18,170
with our GMP,
$350 million citizens,

814
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:18,951
right?
You'd have this.

815
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:23,951
Like this thing is huge as us that would
still have and intact suite of

816
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,393
megafauna.

817
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,940
No one else pulls that off.
So we've accomplished a lot.

818
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,800
But then now and then people just get
pissed because they want to be able to

819
00:36:36,801 --> 00:36:39,950
do stuff while they want.
There's like interests that want to make

820
00:36:39,951 --> 00:36:43,190
money and when they want to make money
and if someone tells him no,

821
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,100
um,
they get a little bit pissy and then the

822
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:50,120
smart ones of them and I will know and I
would never detract from their

823
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:51,800
intelligence.
The smart ones have them.

824
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,860
Um,
rather than walking away,

825
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,880
they go like,
well,

826
00:36:55,881 --> 00:37:00,320
how is this law?
Why is the law this way and what can we

827
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:01,880
do about it?
And Right now,

828
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:06,380
those folks,
those folks have an idea that,

829
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,740
that the solution to their problem is
that we would

830
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,250
begin undoing the great work of people
like Roosevelt and Gifford Pincho and

831
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:20,330
Aldo Leopold and all these,
a seminal American figures that we

832
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:23,030
would,
we would undo their work and go back to

833
00:37:23,031 --> 00:37:24,770
a system where,
um,

834
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,140
where these landscapes are privatized

835
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,930
people who've never been to yellowstone.
And I mean,

836
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:33,670
even if you're not a hunter,
you,

837
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:37,120
you should go once a yellowstone anyway.
Right?

838
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,500
That's the point.
Yeah,

839
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,480
I have problem with that Dan Jordan,
but it's,

840
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,860
I,
it's just forget about hunting,

841
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:49,240
just the fact that we have this immense
state park that you could go to.

842
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:52,120
And I took my kids there this summer and
uh,

843
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,090
we hung out with Buffalo,
were like standing there that there was

844
00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:58,480
a buffalo that was 100 yards away,
which is looking at these giant,

845
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,630
huge prehistoric animals.
Yeah,

846
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:04,840
it's a great place for introductory
wildlife viewing.

847
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,790
We have,
we took a lot of selfies with elk

848
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,220
because the elk,
because the wolf population has

849
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,900
increased in yellowstone,
the elk have decided,

850
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:12,670
look,
there's one spot to hang out the fucking

851
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:13,530
visitor center.
Yeah.

852
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:17,830
So you got by the visitor center.
There's a coca cola machine,

853
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,430
is a vending machine and a right next to
the vending machine.

854
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:24,430
There's a fucking elk just chilling,
just laying down there.

855
00:38:24,431 --> 00:38:29,431
I mean they have zero fear of people and
it's amazing how they become sort of

856
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:32,080
acclimated,
habituated,

857
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,800
betray his work.
It's funny when you look at,

858
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,730
there's a problem.
I've identified it as much as I love

859
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:42,130
yellowstone.
It in my perspective that as a fellow

860
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:45,230
that does what I do for food and,
and,

861
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,630
and,
and enjoyment,

862
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:52,590
which is to hunt A.
I look at it from a grand wildlife thing

863
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:56,350
and I look at it as a,
it serves the purpose of being just like

864
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:58,480
fantastic wildlife sanctuary,
you know,

865
00:38:58,481 --> 00:38:59,051
and everyone,
like,

866
00:38:59,051 --> 00:38:59,830
you know,
our,

867
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,210
our,
our mutual friend Doug,

868
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:02,260
during,
um,

869
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,120
even on his farm,
right?

870
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,960
He has established a,
like a sanctuary area,

871
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,630
like on his farm,
a place where you don't go that it's

872
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,290
always a spot where we're deer go and
they don't get harassed in that area and

873
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:17,290
it's like a self imposed sanctuary and
so you have yellowstone provides that,

874
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,560
but if identified this sorta thing,
um,

875
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,700
the idea I've been working on called
Yellowstone Syndrome though is where

876
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:27,060
people,
Americans,

877
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,210
some,
so many of them,

878
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,390
they're only id about wildlife and
wildlife politics and wildlife

879
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:35,110
management comes from the yellowstone
story,

880
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:40,150
that they wind up having a difficult
time understanding wildlife and wildlife

881
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:43,420
management in situations that are
outside of a national park setting,

882
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:49,240
which is to say they don't have a very
good grasp on the inevitable conflicts

883
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,190
that are going to arise between wildlife
and society.

884
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,120
And that's a large chunk of ground where
you just do not have those sorts of

885
00:39:58,121 --> 00:39:59,950
conflicts.
Like what kind of conflicts we talking

886
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:00,551
about.
Oh,

887
00:40:00,551 --> 00:40:04,090
like for instance,
a thing has been very difficult and very

888
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:07,750
vexing for wildlife managers is what
happens to a what,

889
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,180
what happens to buffalo when they leave
national?

890
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:13,870
The yellowstone national park.
I'm just,

891
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,100
I mean,
tobacco on the,

892
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:20,020
on the yellowstone is she goes to get a
sense for how revolutionary that idea

893
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:21,580
was,
you know,

894
00:40:21,581 --> 00:40:25,090
there was the Indian wars weren't even
over when they made yellowstone.

895
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:27,550
Yellowstone,
you know,

896
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:30,130
we were,
we were still battling American Indians

897
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:32,000
on the Great Plains when you also want
it to affect,

898
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,470
matter of fact,
yellowstone was a park when the Nez

899
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:40,471
perce were chased through by the US army
and they actually killed a couple of

900
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:44,770
terrorists in yellowstone bright at some
of the buildings that are still there.

901
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,450
Wow.
Yeah.

902
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,660
So you,
you went to and got shot by Indians who

903
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:54,790
were engaged in a war with the US army.

904
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,930
Wow.
It was like a,

905
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,850
it was,
it was like they hadn't even,

906
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,190
you know,
the West hadn't even been in some ways

907
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:08,191
that the center west hadn't even been
settled and they were made and they made

908
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:10,420
the national park and then Roosevelt
went there and uh,

909
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,980
you know,
at the commemoration to like,

910
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:13,660
it was,
you know,

911
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:17,540
went there to applaud it.
So I just get a sense of like,

912
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,860
I mean just it was just an outlandish
idea,

913
00:41:19,861 --> 00:41:24,861
was so far ahead of its time,
but with like the buffalo inch situation

914
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:26,800
for instance,
how it's kind of,

915
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:32,130
how it sort of is like colored.
The broader conversation would be a.

916
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,650
You also is one of the few places where
they've,

917
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,160
where the animal buffalo or bison,
you know,

918
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,260
they're,
they're lenay and name is bison.

919
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:44,360
Bison.
Some people say it's bison.

920
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:46,850
Bison.
Bison as opposed to bison.

921
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:51,440
Bison Atha backus at the baskets,
but a buffalo,

922
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,930
I call them Buffalo,
ca.

923
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,400
It's very controversial to calm.
You're not cool if you call them

924
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:56,930
buffalo,
really know you're suppose to call them

925
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,950
bison who you're hanging out with.
Old timey folk.

926
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,440
They use coyote.
Yeah.

927
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,041
Well,
yeah.

928
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:08,130
Well Kyle.
So let's get to that in.

929
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,020
Yeah,
we'll,

930
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,430
we'll call them both Dan Flores books.
Oh you are good with that.

931
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:15,130
Good.
I'm going to call them bison.

932
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,960
What the hell?
So it's [inaudible] was one of the few

933
00:42:17,961 --> 00:42:21,890
places where bison have always existed.
Now at a time,

934
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:24,980
the ones there were fenced and fed,
but they've always been there.

935
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:29,900
And your then you have there is you have
a genetically pure strain or there's

936
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:33,260
been no cattle intro aggression into
those animals.

937
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:36,020
There's only a handful of herds in the
US that were,

938
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:38,300
there hasn't been some amount of cattle
integration.

939
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,460
Um,
you can't see it usually,

940
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,060
but it's there.
Oftentimes there's some New Mexico that

941
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,580
don't.
There's some of the Dakotas that do not

942
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:50,090
in the yellowstone ones do not,
they've never interbred or bending and

943
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,190
interbred with cattle.
So they're valuable in that way.

944
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,840
And you know,
at various times there's,

945
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:56,210
you know,
a few thousand of them in the park and

946
00:42:56,211 --> 00:43:00,450
the snow's pile up and one of the things
they like to do when the snow piles up,

947
00:43:00,451 --> 00:43:04,640
so you'd like to leave the park and
they'd go out at West Yellowstone,

948
00:43:04,641 --> 00:43:06,420
which is one of the primary entrance
points into the,

949
00:43:06,421 --> 00:43:07,810
into the park.
And they'll go out and,

950
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:12,930
and the late at the gardener entrance in
the late winter that were pro,

951
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:17,510
that would be fine.
Probably maybe be kind of fun if it

952
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,860
weren't for a couple of issues.
Uh,

953
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,500
there's a,
there's a livestock disease called

954
00:43:21,501 --> 00:43:25,700
brucellosis and it's a year age and
disease.

955
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:26,391
So it was a,
it's a,

956
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:27,230
it's a nine,
eight,

957
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,060
you know,
we don't know everything of diseases as

958
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:31,910
being native or non native,
but it's a non native disease called

959
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:36,911
Brucellosis and brucellosis causes
cattle to it causes heifers,

960
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:38,900
heifers,
the kyle.

961
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,270
That's hasn't,
you know,

962
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:44,870
with just one young.
So halfers a cow that said having her

963
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:49,160
first going to have her first calf,
it causes the heifers to abort their

964
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:53,810
fetus.
Now they've gotten brucellosis

965
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:58,990
eradicated from cattle hurts.
Generally when a state is getting

966
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:02,240
brucellosis cases they have to pay for
testing.

967
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,120
Okay.
So it's expensive to get all your cows

968
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:06,890
tests,
but if you have brucellosis in your

969
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:10,700
state,
the producers got to pay the testing to

970
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,980
get them tested to make sure that not
brucellosis positive.

971
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:18,310
Well cattle long ago past brucellosis to
the Bison on the Bison leave the park.

972
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:25,150
They carry brucellosis with them and
could reintroduce it into cattle herds

973
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,190
though that hasn't.
There's no known case of that happening.

974
00:44:28,191 --> 00:44:30,710
I don't have it spread.
They well,

975
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,160
uh,
the primary way it spread his animals

976
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:38,430
eat their own afterbirth and Lee after
birth of other animals.

977
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,760
That's an interesting thing.
Why the ether?

978
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,010
You know,
some folks he thrown.

979
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,660
I proposed that to my wife.
She was not down with it at all,

980
00:44:46,661 --> 00:44:49,000
but I've got friends that take their
placenta.

981
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:53,230
I got some buddies that had their wives
placentas made into pills.

982
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,210
Pills?
Yeah.

983
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:57,220
There's some gal that dries it up and
puts it in capsules for you.

984
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,110
I've heard of people cooking it with
carrots.

985
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,360
Yeah.
I wanted to cook some man,

986
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,260
but their thing is when my wife,
uh,

987
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,390
I swore up and down like I was going to
drink the breast milk,

988
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,620
you know,
I've got a body to put breast milk in

989
00:45:08,621 --> 00:45:09,940
his coffee and everything.
Man,

990
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:13,270
you know,
and do to nea and I couldn't go near.

991
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,310
Does he wear a diaper to know?
But he's like,

992
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:17,380
he'll go if he's going to have coffee,
you know,

993
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:19,870
w when women are breastfeeding,
they have little bottles in the fridge

994
00:45:19,871 --> 00:45:20,540
and everything.

995
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,251
Yeah.
He just go in there,

996
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:22,960
grab one of those,
put it in his coffee and cheese.

997
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:25,660
It's just drink it.
I tried it just to taste,

998
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,700
but I felt like I was stealing from my
kid.

999
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,080
I felt like I was being a cannibal,
which is one thing that's my.

1000
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:34,270
That's where I draw a line.
That's where you draw the line.

1001
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:35,470
Well,
you ate a monkey.

1002
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:36,820
Yeah,
I know and I felt horrible.

1003
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,420
Did you know?
Yeah,

1004
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:39,810
I felt real bad.
Well not so bad.

1005
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,880
I didn't eat it,
but it was,

1006
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,750
it was.
It was like emotionally complicated for

1007
00:45:43,751 --> 00:45:44,561
me.
But.

1008
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:46,510
So we'll get back to that.
Yeah.

1009
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:48,960
The brucellosis deal.
I'm trying to get.

1010
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:51,310
I'm trying to excel in yellow.
I'm trying to explain like yellowstone

1011
00:45:51,311 --> 00:45:52,860
syndrome.
So the bruise,

1012
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,050
the lowest.
The steel is a real issue for some

1013
00:45:56,051 --> 00:45:59,800
people.
So it conceivably a buffalo could leave

1014
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:01,720
yellowstone,
give birth.

1015
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:04,480
The afterbirth could be their cow,
could eat that after birth can get blue

1016
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,570
brucellosis and like everything.
And like everything we're talking about,

1017
00:46:07,571 --> 00:46:11,830
this is so there's so many caveats and
complications and things such as elk

1018
00:46:11,831 --> 00:46:14,560
have brucellosis but outcome and go as
they please.

1019
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:18,700
Right?
So the minute a buffalo or bison,

1020
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,800
when he leaves Yellowstone National
Park,

1021
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:24,940
if he walks into Montana now,
it's not even fenced,

1022
00:46:24,941 --> 00:46:26,290
right?
It's like he doesn't know,

1023
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:31,820
but when he crosses the line,
he goes from being a wild animal,

1024
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,920
from being native wildlife.
Okay.

1025
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,400
To being livestock.
So he goes from being the property of

1026
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:43,780
like under the administration of the
National Park Service to the

1027
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:46,720
administration of Montana's Department
of livestock.

1028
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:48,730
Wow.
Native animal.

1029
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,830
Now she goes,
how does that work though,

1030
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,280
if the native animal crosses over onto
private property is the only.

1031
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:58,150
He's the only animal that happens too.
So coyotes,

1032
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,620
Fox,
Wolverines,

1033
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,940
grizzly bears,
black bears,

1034
00:47:00,941 --> 00:47:02,650
bighorn sheep,
elk,

1035
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,600
mule deer,
white tail deer,

1036
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:05,463
Moose.

1037
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:11,840
They leave their wildlife.
Buffalo leaves.

1038
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:15,950
He becomes errant livestock.
Wow.

1039
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,020
Therefore,
every year there's a,

1040
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,940
you know,
there's a perennial story every year

1041
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:25,070
where a bunch of buffalo leave the park
and get rounded up by the Department of

1042
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:28,430
livestock and sent to quarantine are
usually sent off to slaughter.

1043
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,160
Yeah,
they just killed a bunch of them.

1044
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:31,750
They killed like 2000 of them.
Yeah man,

1045
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:32,584
they get,
they get a lot of them.

1046
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:34,180
Um,
you know,

1047
00:47:34,181 --> 00:47:35,770
that plays cranks out a lot of animals
too.

1048
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:38,350
So it's like they're always throwing out
these humongous numbers of animals

1049
00:47:38,351 --> 00:47:40,810
they've gotten in and every year you
wind up having quite a few animals in

1050
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:41,644
the park.
So,

1051
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,250
uh,
but it's a thing now people point out

1052
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:50,251
this because elk have brucellosis in elk
are calving in proximity to cattle and

1053
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:56,680
there and as far as we know that there's
not like all your in class cases of

1054
00:47:56,681 --> 00:48:00,340
cattle,
of elk transmitting brucellosis to

1055
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:00,910
cattle.

1056
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,250
People wonder like,
well why are bison picked on?

1057
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,960
You know,
why them.

1058
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,840
And one thing might be to say that we
got,

1059
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:09,790
and this is generally true of wildlife
in America,

1060
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:15,030
I think there was a brief period around
1900 when we had,

1061
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:18,400
you know,
maybe about 75 of them left in the US.

1062
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,880
People got very used to their sort of
like not being Buffalo Bison.

1063
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:29,610
And now this becoming like an a player
again is the,

1064
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,360
the animals becoming a player again that
we now have.

1065
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:35,410
We were down to 75.
We've got 500,000 in the US now.

1066
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:37,390
Ninety four percent of them are
privately owned,

1067
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:41,530
but we have a population of a half
million buffalo in his country.

1068
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,720
Um,
so.

1069
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,150
But we got really used to them not being
around.

1070
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:48,220
And so it was this thing,
it was like this additive thing.

1071
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,830
Like I think if there had been a long
period when there were no elk.

1072
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,080
And then all of a sudden someone said,
hey,

1073
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:55,780
guess what?
We're bringing these big ass ungulates

1074
00:48:55,781 --> 00:49:00,781
back the eat tons of stuff.
And they're huge and they might have a

1075
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:05,590
disease and we're just going to let tens
of thousands of them cut loose across

1076
00:49:05,591 --> 00:49:07,000
the landscape,
have been up in arms,

1077
00:49:07,001 --> 00:49:09,310
but they were used to it because elk are
always on the ground.

1078
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:12,120
So that's why buffalo recovery has been
so hard because it's kind,

1079
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:14,470
kinda like you're trying to sell people
on this new thing,

1080
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:17,560
even though historically it's hardly new
they've been around,

1081
00:49:17,561 --> 00:49:19,210
but there's just,
there was a period of,

1082
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,280
you know,
century,

1083
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,960
not quite a century when it wasn't an
issue.

1084
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:27,990
So it's really hard to get livestock
interest and private land owners around

1085
00:49:28,571 --> 00:49:33,100
these areas to unanimously get on board
with the idea that we're gonna have

1086
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:36,460
animals roaming out of the park that
are,

1087
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:41,550
has been proven to happen that will get
into your corral and kill your horse or,

1088
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:47,350
you know,
take out a school bus if it hits them or

1089
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,480
possibly transmit disease.

1090
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,210
And the big thing that people don't
really talk about but which is a huge

1091
00:49:52,211 --> 00:49:55,180
issue is um,
impact grazing rights,

1092
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,160
impact cattle,
cattle grazing,

1093
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:01,510
get back to kill the horse.
You had a gore that Gore stuff,

1094
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,120
they just go into the horse of stable
and fuck them out.

1095
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:07,360
It's happened when they run,
they run crazy.

1096
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,190
Yeah.
They wrote in the summer and in the

1097
00:50:09,191 --> 00:50:13,050
Bulls get very.
They get real fired up and then,

1098
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,530
you know,
the funny thing there too with,

1099
00:50:14,531 --> 00:50:16,750
with the yellowstone ones,
you're dealing with animals that are

1100
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:18,280
habituated,
so it's only been like,

1101
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,630
you know,
it's been 100 years that you can't.

1102
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:20,950
You haven't been able to hunt in the
park.

1103
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:23,080
The animals have gotten habituated to
humans.

1104
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,020
We like to look at yellowstone,
think you're seeing something kind of

1105
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:27,440
natural,
but you're actually seeing something

1106
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:31,930
pretty unnatural because that landscape
was hunted for 12,000 years the last

1107
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,260
hundred years,
not withstanding.

1108
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,570
So the he wrote always hunted
yellowstone.

1109
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:38,360
The unnatural thing is these animals are
super comfortable.

1110
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:41,660
Being habituated to humans is unusual,
but we go there and be like,

1111
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:43,010
this is what animals were like.
I'm like,

1112
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,520
not if you draw a line back to when
humans arrived in the new world.

1113
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,590
Well,
that was one of the more fascinating

1114
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:53,570
things about Dan Flores on your podcast
where he was talking about buffalo and

1115
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:58,571
that at one point in time the Indians or
the native Americans when they had guns

1116
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:03,020
and they had horses,
they were on their way to extra painting

1117
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,660
the buffalo on their own.
Yeah.

1118
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,500
Before the market hunters came into
place.

1119
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:08,720
That's an incredibly controversial idea.
That was a.

1120
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:10,190
yeah,
that was a controversial idea.

1121
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:14,960
Now is put for again,
not I talk in my book that I wrote,

1122
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,210
you know,
I have a book of American Buffalo about,

1123
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,110
you know,
the history of the animal and,

1124
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,400
and in my own personal experiences is
hunting for the animal and finding a

1125
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:25,520
skull of one that I found that absorb a
journey that led me down.

1126
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:29,570
But in working on that book,
I spent a quiet time reading the work of

1127
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:33,300
Dan Flores and he was a mentor of mine
in graduate school and he,

1128
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:37,350
and he wrote this a very interesting
piece called Bison Ecology Bison

1129
00:51:37,351 --> 00:51:40,430
diplomacy.
And what he looked at was he was trying

1130
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,600
to find,
was there a period when,

1131
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:45,830
um,
when plains tribes.

1132
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,320
Okay,
was there a period when native Americans

1133
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,560
had actually reached equilibrium with
the bison herds and,

1134
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:57,890
and he argued that there was,
not,

1135
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:00,480
that they had not achieved equilibrium,
um,

1136
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:05,530
that even if that one of the,
one of the points he makes many points

1137
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,770
this thing out,
I don't want to sell.

1138
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,140
This is pete short,
it's a,

1139
00:52:08,141 --> 00:52:10,910
it's a very large piece of scholarly
work,

1140
00:52:10,911 --> 00:52:14,870
but one of the things he talks about is
just the introduction of the horse

1141
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:21,590
had humongous impacts on the animals on
buffalo for a handful of reasons.

1142
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,650
Grazing competition.
Okay.

1143
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,770
So enormous hort herds of wild horses
and the horse was distributed.

1144
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:30,700
So you traced in flurries explains all
of this as well.

1145
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:34,610
You can trace horses in to native
American tribes on the Great Plains and

1146
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:36,980
elsewhere they go back to the Pueblo
revolt.

1147
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:40,100
So you know,
the Spanish can keep the doors last lot

1148
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:45,101
of their animals and the animals are
traded up the east earned face and up

1149
00:52:45,111 --> 00:52:47,840
the western face to the rockies.
And then we're distributed all around.

1150
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,810
And so you're,
when you get this idea in your head of

1151
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:51,540
a,
of a,

1152
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:56,540
of a plains warrior right,
mounted on horseback hunting for

1153
00:52:57,021 --> 00:53:01,220
Buffalo,
that was a very distinct phenomenon that

1154
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:04,580
didn't last
nearly.

1155
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,670
It didn't last as long as the US has
been a country

1156
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:14,330
like it did not last long between the
introduction of the horse and the Indian

1157
00:53:15,161 --> 00:53:15,994
wars

1158
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:18,110
they want to.
But like largely,

1159
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,480
you know,
re removing free roaming,

1160
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:24,770
um,
autonomous tribes off off the great

1161
00:53:24,771 --> 00:53:26,730
plains.
It just didn't last that long even

1162
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:30,840
though it became like the iconic image
of the mountain plains hunter.

1163
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:35,010
And what he argues is the advent of the
horse changed hunting practices.

1164
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:39,150
So much up until that point,
you had tribes that were,

1165
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:44,370
were partially or largely agrarian
coming out of the Mississippi River

1166
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:48,030
valley out of the Missouri River valley
that would grow crops.

1167
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,400
And they would,
during the summer when the buffalo herds

1168
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:53,190
were gathered into tremendous gatherings
during the breeding season,

1169
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,970
they would do trips.
They would do buffalo hunting trips.

1170
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,950
Once they had the horse.
You had all these cultures turn into

1171
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,960
nomadic cultures that could have a troy
and a horse and just follow the hurts

1172
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:11,070
and it was a tremendous amount of
pressure put on these animals to support

1173
00:54:11,071 --> 00:54:16,071
that amount where you had tribes
migrating out onto the great plains and

1174
00:54:16,681 --> 00:54:21,681
fighting over those resources and I
think believe was one of his graduate

1175
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:25,800
students later looked at this piece
where when Lewis and Clark did their big

1176
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,260
westward journey in the early 18
hundreds,

1177
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,290
the places where they talked about
seeing the greatest amounts where they

1178
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:33,720
were just blown away by how many buffalo
they're seeing.

1179
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:39,020
We're generally fa fell upon sort of no
man's lands areas between warring

1180
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:44,160
tribes.
So the buffers of zone,

1181
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:48,390
the buffers of traditional hunting zones
like where the blackfeet and the Su met

1182
00:54:48,391 --> 00:54:52,920
up the edge habitat.
There was where you had a lot of animals

1183
00:54:52,921 --> 00:54:54,390
that weren't getting exploited by
people.

1184
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:58,440
So you started to see these like
regional extra patients of the animal

1185
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:03,330
and then firearms.
What was another big blow where even

1186
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:05,520
outside of white hide hunters just
showing up,

1187
00:55:05,521 --> 00:55:06,360
but just those,
those,

1188
00:55:06,361 --> 00:55:09,990
those European technologies of horse
gun.

1189
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,090
You were seeing a a steady depletion
that would have not been in.

1190
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,490
It seems like the resource would not
have lasted and you'd had the same

1191
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:20,520
outcome.
What was interesting about his paper was

1192
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:25,230
that he was saying that the early
settlers or the early explorers of the

1193
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,750
United States in the 15 and 16 hundreds,
they didn't talk about Buffalo,

1194
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,540
so when the Spanish,
the Spanish would go through places and

1195
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:34,020
they would.

1196
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:37,740
They would name wildlife now like some
of the Spanish came through,

1197
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:40,680
you know,
they go through the entire Florida.

1198
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:42,150
Some of the first guys have stepped foot
in Florida.

1199
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:44,310
They talked about everything they see
right down to possums.

1200
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:49,970
Okay.
They're not describing buffalo though.

1201
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,060
They're describing everything else.
The English going there 200 years later

1202
00:55:54,061 --> 00:55:57,720
and they're talking about buffalo.
So there's sightings in what's now new

1203
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:02,370
orleans.
Cabeza de Vaca ran into buffalo around

1204
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:05,340
what's now Houston.
There's sightings of buffalo in what is

1205
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:09,330
now Washington DC.
Simon Kenton and Daniel Boone figures

1206
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:13,590
like that were hunting them around the
site of Nashville and Memphis.

1207
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,000
They were all way to the east coast.
It seems there are only a handful of

1208
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:20,490
states that at some point in time didn't
have any.

1209
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:24,190
My home state of Michigan doesn't seem
like there were any for a long time.

1210
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:28,150
People thought that there had been
buffalo in New York,

1211
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:33,130
but it turns out the the evidence for
them and the paleontological and

1212
00:56:33,131 --> 00:56:35,320
archeological record is two skulls.

1213
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:40,000
Both the schools have cultural markings
on them and it seems that they were the

1214
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:44,890
same way that that mean in in Joe here
will like hunt an animal and bring the

1215
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:48,400
head home that they might've been just
things someone had trophies that were

1216
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:51,190
traded or whatever because there's no
other phone will remain from the animals

1217
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:52,550
in New York,
but most places had them.

1218
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:56,370
Now the mound builders,
so you have all these like mississippian

1219
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,060
culture is along the Mississippi River
in Ohio.

1220
00:56:58,061 --> 00:56:59,530
River valley is called the mountain
boulders.

1221
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,340
They made these giant effigy mounds that
people didn't even realize they were

1222
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:08,341
there until we had airplanes to get
above and see the snakes and serpents

1223
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:12,670
and deer and all these creatures.
They were building out our earth mounds

1224
00:57:12,671 --> 00:57:15,280
that were so big that guys would like
live around the mountain and never

1225
00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:17,980
recognize it for what it was until they
could look at it from above.

1226
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,290
You can see these things with satellite
imagery.

1227
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:25,740
They never built buffalo mounds,
but once we emptied,

1228
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:29,740
and this is one argument,
kind of a Tupac argument,

1229
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:36,010
once smallpox and other diseases carried
off 90 percent of native Americans,

1230
00:57:36,011 --> 00:57:37,690
90.
That's an estimate.

1231
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,310
Jesus.
Many people say that.

1232
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,010
I mean that's I,
I think it's a.

1233
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,080
I think like the scholar,
the consensus is that it's,

1234
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,050
that it's in that ballpark.
What are the numbers?

1235
00:57:47,051 --> 00:57:49,030
Do they estimate the actual physical
numbers?

1236
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:49,960
You know,
I've seen it,

1237
00:57:49,961 --> 00:57:52,300
but I don't know what it is.
I think that there was a number that was

1238
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:54,370
floating around for awhile,
10 million,

1239
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,780
but I remember a lot of people criticize
that number as being high.

1240
00:57:58,781 --> 00:58:00,580
I don't know what the fashionable number
is now,

1241
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:04,990
but 90 percent approximately why
diseases diseases from the Europeans and

1242
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:09,860
that this was primarily responsible for
this explosion in the population,

1243
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:10,570
the Buffalo.

1244
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:14,050
So that's why when the Spanish would go
into places,

1245
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:18,190
this is a theory now the Spanish,
we're going to places first contact,

1246
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,200
like first peoples traipse through an
area,

1247
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:24,010
they would go into places and they were
described village after village,

1248
00:58:24,011 --> 00:58:25,840
after village,
after village.

1249
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,130
Okay.
And they never talked about buffalo to

1250
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,770
English.
While later they'll go down,

1251
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:34,480
someone guy,
I'll go down the Mississippi river,

1252
00:58:34,481 --> 00:58:35,890
he knows,
see shit for people.

1253
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,130
But it was buffalo crawling everywhere.
Wow.

1254
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,830
So,
and another issue,

1255
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:43,630
another thing people talk about is
changing agricultural practices that

1256
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:48,631
slash and burn agriculture was becoming
a used and slash and burn agriculture

1257
00:58:49,091 --> 00:58:50,360
was conducive to,
to,

1258
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,320
to uh,
spreading to.

1259
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:55,810
It wasn't conducive to buffalo because
it created open spaces for them.

1260
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,600
That's another thing people look at is
slash and burn agriculture.

1261
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:03,601
But either way it's proposed that the
apex of

1262
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:10,950
that species was at the moment we found
the fashionable number used to be $60

1263
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:13,924
million.
And that was,

1264
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,780
that was put forth by a guy named,
you know,

1265
00:59:16,781 --> 00:59:19,270
Dodge city,
dodge city,

1266
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:21,860
Kansas.
Got His name from a guy named Colonel

1267
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,130
Dodge,

1268
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,840
Colonel Dodge.
I could see,

1269
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:26,090
if you're interested,
I could explain how he came up with it,

1270
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:29,150
but Colonel Dodge is the one that
floated the idea that there were 60

1271
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:32,870
million buffalo,
now the fashionable number is,

1272
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:34,340
you know,
32 years,

1273
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,980
$32,
million or 40 million and people say

1274
00:59:36,981 --> 00:59:41,030
that that was that.
That was an extraordinary amount of

1275
00:59:41,031 --> 00:59:46,031
those animals and we witnessed it at its
apex and that at other times in the

1276
00:59:47,301 --> 00:59:50,210
history of the continent and other times
with the natural history of our

1277
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,770
continent,
there weren't nearly that many of the

1278
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:52,604
animals.

1279
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,850
Fascinating concept and I never had
heard it before.

1280
00:59:57,330 --> 01:00:00,960
I'd only heard that there was a giant
numbers of them and that the Europeans

1281
01:00:00,961 --> 01:00:05,330
came over and Americans wiped them out
because we wanted the skulls and the for

1282
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:05,690
[inaudible].

1283
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:09,230
We wiped out the tail end of them.
So if you get to like the end of the

1284
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:12,440
day,
once you get to the end of the civil

1285
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:16,050
war,
you know at that point there's maybe $15

1286
01:00:16,051 --> 01:00:18,710
million and that's when it was.
It was in 18,

1287
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:23,720
71 and 1872 that the,
what you might call the commercial scale

1288
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:31,370
harvest of the animals happened and it
happened in the south,

1289
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:34,180
what was called the southern herd around
1871,

1290
01:00:34,181 --> 01:00:37,820
18,
72 and the area surrounding dodge city

1291
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:42,850
where there's a large population of them
and then it took 10 years by 18,

1292
01:00:44,091 --> 01:00:45,200
82.
You couldn't find one.

1293
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:48,370
Wow.
So the last big slaughter happened

1294
01:00:48,371 --> 01:00:51,410
around mile city,
Montana and it happened when the

1295
01:00:51,411 --> 01:00:52,970
railroad,
the railroad,

1296
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,360
made it to mile city.
The northern Pacific made it to mile

1297
01:00:56,361 --> 01:01:01,310
city and and provided a way to get hides
the market and they did the last big

1298
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,290
kill there and killed about a million of
them up there.

1299
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:08,770
And then a year later Roosevelt came out
to Madora North Dakota there

1300
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:13,670
thereabouts,
hired a guide in scoured the countryside

1301
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:18,110
hunting through the carcasses of riding
animals,

1302
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,530
trying to find one last one.
Wow.

1303
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,990
So they could save him?
No,

1304
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,240
he wanted to get one.
It was his epiphany.

1305
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:31,370
He got to think about that guy.
He kills one and does a war dance around

1306
01:01:31,371 --> 01:01:34,010
it.
What kind of dances that I don't know,

1307
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:36,950
I've always heard described as a war
dance who didn't Holler and dancing

1308
01:01:36,951 --> 01:01:38,370
around like a hunting show.
Wow.

1309
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:45,010
So,
but then whatever kind of effect it had

1310
01:01:45,381 --> 01:01:47,780
on him,
he then went and became the most

1311
01:01:47,781 --> 01:01:50,780
influential conservation is we've ever
had in this country.

1312
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:53,360
So it struck him somehow.
But as a young man,

1313
01:01:53,361 --> 01:01:54,051
yeah,
he was like,

1314
01:01:54,051 --> 01:01:55,550
man,
I missed it.

1315
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,730
There's got to be one left.
So you found one.

1316
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:02,660
He caught one,
killed the Montana North Dakota border

1317
01:02:02,661 --> 01:02:04,000
there and then.

1318
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,890
And then went on to do all these kinds
of amazing things.

1319
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,020
But that was,
that was the,

1320
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,290
that was the big slaughter.
What's cool about that?

1321
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:14,120
The time that worked out,
his photography was just coming out.

1322
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:16,790
People were starting to have portable
cameras and there's a photographer named

1323
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:20,700
La Hoffman had been sent out to miles
city and he actually took a lot of

1324
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:25,730
images of those hide hunters working.
The last big hurt,

1325
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:29,760
the last big shoot 'em.
And then shortly after that there was

1326
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:31,930
some number animals left.
And uh,

1327
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,390
and they lead a bunch of,
uh,

1328
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,350
they a lot of bunch of plains Indians
to,

1329
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,280
to leave one of the reservations and
they went and did a little bit of a mop

1330
01:02:38,281 --> 01:02:39,180
up.
But yeah.

1331
01:02:39,181 --> 01:02:40,030
Then shortly,
uh,

1332
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,920
shortly thereafter there was a guy named
Hornaday who was kind of writing letters

1333
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:46,680
around trying to find out who had one of
these things laying around because

1334
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:49,140
they'd all fallen into private hands,
you know,

1335
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:52,320
there's guys like buffalo hunters would
kill them and they'd be like,

1336
01:02:52,321 --> 01:02:55,170
Holy Shit,
there's like none left.

1337
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,940
And some of these guys actually went out
and caught a couple.

1338
01:02:56,941 --> 01:03:00,930
There was a guy named Buffalo Jones down
in Texas that went out last,

1339
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:03,420
sold a couple calves,
raised them on a cow's milk.

1340
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,480
And that's how,
that's why we even have some now.

1341
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,620
Now it turns out no one knew this,
but it turns out there was several

1342
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,850
hundred in Canada that no one knew
about.

1343
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:13,950
Really?
They didn't know about until much,

1344
01:03:13,951 --> 01:03:15,600
much later.
And how'd they get to Mexico?

1345
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,020
Oh,
they probably always roamed in New

1346
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,280
Mexico.
Now,

1347
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:25,590
the first buffalo the European ever laid
eyes on was in Mexico,

1348
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,440
now Mexico City,
but it was in,

1349
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,940
it was in,
uh,

1350
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,450
who is the,
who is the,

1351
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:33,930
the emperor there,
you know,

1352
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:36,540
a
Jamie.

1353
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:37,540
What was that dude's name?
The,

1354
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:42,541
the Aztec leader in Mexico to notch to
notch lawn was [inaudible].

1355
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,000
I'm Kevin.
What years?

1356
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,280
We're talking about know in the 15
hundreds.

1357
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:54,090
Cortez found one in Mexico City,
but it was in a zoo.

1358
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,580
Montezuma?
Try saying that.

1359
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,770
The city of topnotch salon.
Oh,

1360
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:03,120
okay.
So which is in which is now Mexico City.

1361
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:05,520
Uh,
they had,

1362
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:09,180
he had one in a zoo.
That was the first one described by

1363
01:04:09,181 --> 01:04:10,350
European.
Wow.

1364
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:12,900
But he was hundreds of miles away from
their native range.

1365
01:04:12,901 --> 01:04:14,430
They just had one,
as he had all kinds.

1366
01:04:14,431 --> 01:04:17,010
He had a menagerie.
He had all kinds of animals that he

1367
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:21,830
collected from throughout their domains.
So that was the first one described by

1368
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,000
European,
but he didn't realize that the time that

1369
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:27,480
it was from far north of there,
but they did stray down into the,

1370
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:30,540
into Sonora.
And they strayed well of all the way up.

1371
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:33,570
You know,
still today we have by great slave lake,

1372
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,240
you know,
the extent well up into Canada,

1373
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:39,270
so there was a number of them,
some people call them wood buffalo,

1374
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:44,450
some people accept the idea that there's
subspecies by last time about bison.

1375
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,250
Bison,
Athabaskan,

1376
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:47,011
Bison,
Bison,

1377
01:04:47,011 --> 01:04:51,540
Bison Plains Bison would bison.
There's morphological differences.

1378
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:54,300
They look different.
They're in the boreal forest.

1379
01:04:54,301 --> 01:04:58,500
There were hundreds that we didn't know
about and know some of those populations

1380
01:04:58,501 --> 01:05:00,960
are still in now in Canada.
So we have,

1381
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:01,410
you know,
like,

1382
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:03,810
like,
like in all things with Americans,

1383
01:05:03,811 --> 01:05:06,180
we have an American centric view of
everything.

1384
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,660
We have an American centric view of
wildlife where we'll say there's only 75

1385
01:05:09,661 --> 01:05:12,540
left and I feel like our Canadian
neighbors are oftentimes being like,

1386
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:15,240
you know what,
we didn't quite handle it quite as badly

1387
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:19,420
as you folks did.
So yeah,

1388
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:22,330
it was a,
you know,

1389
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:23,800
it's a long,
bizarre picture.

1390
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:26,440
I can't remember what the hell we get
even got us on the subject.

1391
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,900
Uh,
Dan Flores,

1392
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,180
uh,
I don't remember either.

1393
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:34,480
Public lands,
Yellowstone Syndrome,

1394
01:05:34,481 --> 01:05:36,790
yellowstone brucellosis.
Yeah.

1395
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:40,550
So there's a tremendous background in
the buffalo story.

1396
01:05:40,551 --> 01:05:42,160
Has we just explored and

1397
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:44,470
w,
W,

1398
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:49,470
W if you follow wildlife politics,
it's a conversation happening in places

1399
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,680
like Alaska,
which is a whole other long story,

1400
01:05:52,681 --> 01:05:54,510
but how it's happening there,
it's happening in Alaska,

1401
01:05:54,511 --> 01:05:57,540
is happening in Montana.
It's having a Wyoming is happening in

1402
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:59,640
the DAKOTAS.
Um,

1403
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:02,640
which would be.
Do we welcome,

1404
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:07,670
are we going to welcome this animal back
onto the landscape as a free roaming

1405
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,740
wild animal?
Like all of our other.

1406
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:17,790
Earlier I mentioned how this country,
we have an intact suite of megafauna

1407
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:22,350
like we haven't lost.
We might have damn few of some things.

1408
01:06:22,351 --> 01:06:24,090
We haven't lost any of our large
mammals.

1409
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:28,320
It's kind of mind boggling during the
colonial period.

1410
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:29,760
Uh,
western Europe,

1411
01:06:29,761 --> 01:06:33,450
I think last five or six species of
large mammals.

1412
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:37,280
The oryx many things we've,
we haven't,

1413
01:06:37,281 --> 01:06:40,190
we haven't lost any large mammals.
We came pretty close though,

1414
01:06:40,191 --> 01:06:41,990
right?
Damn calls with the buffalo in

1415
01:06:41,991 --> 01:06:42,824
particular.
Yeah.

1416
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:44,150
And we lost.
We've lost birds.

1417
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:47,000
We lost the passenger pigeon and we lost
the ivory billed woodpecker.

1418
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:49,910
And you know,
we lost many things of many kinds of.

1419
01:06:49,911 --> 01:06:50,511
Many.
Not many,

1420
01:06:50,511 --> 01:06:53,390
but we've lost substantial numbers of
things we haven't lost any large mammal.

1421
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,790
Extinction is terrifying for us.
Right.

1422
01:06:55,791 --> 01:07:00,240
That's one expression that a extinction
man made.

1423
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:01,500
Extinction.
Yeah.

1424
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:04,540
That's terrifying for me.
To me it's a,

1425
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:07,520
um,
it's a moral sin

1426
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,560
that just is like,
you know,

1427
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:14,220
we have all these conversations in
bioethics and other things about playing

1428
01:07:14,221 --> 01:07:16,380
God.
I think that extinction like human cause

1429
01:07:16,381 --> 01:07:18,690
extinction is a,
it's terrifying.

1430
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:22,070
Do you support if there is evidence of
human products to human caused

1431
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:24,290
extinction,
if there is the opportunity to bring

1432
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:27,560
something back through scientific
methods through like some sort of

1433
01:07:27,561 --> 01:07:29,180
cloning.
Do you support that or you think it's

1434
01:07:29,181 --> 01:07:30,260
gone,
it's gone,

1435
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:30,980
it's gone,

1436
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,990
man.
I'm on the fence about it and in my

1437
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:37,820
understanding of the,
my understanding of the technology is

1438
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:41,480
probably too limited for me to really
speak to it with any authority but it.

1439
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:44,930
But the most interesting aspect of that
is when you get into the Pleistocene

1440
01:07:44,931 --> 01:07:49,931
extinctions where you notice it just
just to kind of bring people up to speed

1441
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:55,750
on what that means.
If you just look globally at where we

1442
01:07:55,851 --> 01:07:59,150
lost that,
where we lost were in when we lost

1443
01:07:59,151 --> 01:08:02,870
package terms,
so elephants including the woolly

1444
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:05,990
mammoth,
mastodon and in our own on our own

1445
01:08:05,991 --> 01:08:07,940
continent.
If you look around like where are we

1446
01:08:07,941 --> 01:08:11,570
last packet terms,
we always lose pack derms.

1447
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:17,170
I'm right around the time show up,
know,

1448
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:20,230
like we lost,
we lost them,

1449
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,280
you know,
humans arrived in the new world.

1450
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,250
It's a hotly debated number.
14,

1451
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:29,510
15,000 years ago.
And I'm kind of contemporaneous with the

1452
01:08:29,511 --> 01:08:34,400
extinction of woolly mammoths and we
know that to some degree humans were

1453
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,730
preying on wooly mammoths and mastodons.

1454
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,840
There's context of,
of hunting equipment in context with,

1455
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:42,190
with wooly,
mammoth remains.

1456
01:08:42,191 --> 01:08:44,180
There's butchering sites,
there's all kinds of stuff.

1457
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:46,950
And they vanished right around then,
um,

1458
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:52,130
yet we didn't reach an island out in the
Bering Sea till 4,000 years ago and

1459
01:08:52,131 --> 01:08:54,920
there was a woolly mammoth on that
island till 4,000 years ago.

1460
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:58,100
And then dudes show up.
It's gone.

1461
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:01,270
So some people will look,
there's a thing called the blitzkrieg

1462
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,640
hypothesis,
which hold that all these large mammals

1463
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:07,190
though,
nine general of large mammals that went

1464
01:09:07,191 --> 01:09:10,610
extinct when humans arrived in the new
world that they were somehow human

1465
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:12,830
caused extinctions.
Not other people argue that it was,

1466
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,300
you know,
other things,

1467
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:17,990
climate change issues.
Randall Carlson is a guy who I've had on

1468
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:22,160
my podcast before and he argues that
it's due to asteroidal impacts.

1469
01:09:22,161 --> 01:09:24,200
Yeah.
I hung out with a guy who's doing

1470
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:26,720
research on that and there's a lot of
evidence of evidence.

1471
01:09:26,721 --> 01:09:30,200
This guy was looking for nano diamonds.
Guy Found namel domain or diamonds,

1472
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:32,930
I think you say it's called Triton
night,

1473
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,080
but it's nuclear glass.
It's the same exact glass that they get

1474
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:38,020
on sand when they have nuclear
explosions.

1475
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:41,090
When they do test sites,
they find that all throughout Europe and

1476
01:09:41,091 --> 01:09:44,090
it's all around 12,000 years and there's
also more,

1477
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:47,300
somewhere around 10,000.
So it seems like somewhere between

1478
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:51,710
12,000 and then another thousand years
or so later there was another series of

1479
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:54,200
impacts.
And it has to do with this,

1480
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:57,050
uh,
asteroid belt that we pass through.

1481
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:00,710
And it was fucking fascinating but
terrifying conversation with.

1482
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,450
I went with a guy that,
there's a,

1483
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,740
there's a famous,
uh,

1484
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:08,660
Paleoindian site,
north of Denver called the Linden Meyer

1485
01:10:08,661 --> 01:10:11,480
site and the Linda Meyer site was one of
the few,

1486
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:16,720
not one of the only place that we now
know were large gatherings of the,

1487
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:22,380
of the folsom culture,
a large gatherings of the folsom culture

1488
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:27,470
where you had perhaps hundreds of folsom
hunters in one place at one time and the

1489
01:10:27,471 --> 01:10:29,200
site is marked by a larger,
like a,

1490
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:32,840
like an easily recognizable escarpment.
And it's,

1491
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:35,600
it's presumed that it was just a place
that you could describe and people could

1492
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:37,060
meet up.
But that's the,

1493
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:40,710
the Linden Meyer site has been studied
extensively in tons of radiocarbon

1494
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:42,410
dating has happened at Linden Meyer
site.

1495
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:45,570
And I was with a guy there who was
looking,

1496
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,740
who is working on that theory.
Then you know,

1497
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:51,530
the theory with the,
the asteroid impact and the nano

1498
01:10:51,531 --> 01:10:55,340
diamonds,
because he was able to go draw samples

1499
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:59,750
from strata that had been tested and
studied so much,

1500
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:03,220
which is an expensive laborious process
to get datelines,

1501
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:03,890
you know,
when he was there,

1502
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:07,220
drawn those things out.
And then I had other people who,

1503
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:11,560
who worked professionally in this space
talking about how um,

1504
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,740
because sorta ridiculing idea

1505
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,640
and saying that it's just like one of
these ideas that never dies and I'm

1506
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:20,200
never quite lives but never quite dies.
And,

1507
01:11:20,201 --> 01:11:22,920
and uh,
but when you look at it,

1508
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:25,380
it's just so hard to believe that they
hunted them to extinction so quickly.

1509
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,890
Well,
the many things,

1510
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:31,230
65 percent of all the North American
mammals died really quickly and it

1511
01:11:31,231 --> 01:11:32,550
wasn't just big stuff.
Yeah.

1512
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,140
The thing is like we use it because when
we used to do digs,

1513
01:11:37,141 --> 01:11:38,940
right,
they used to do like archeological digs,

1514
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,820
you know,
they would use high pressure hoses and

1515
01:11:41,821 --> 01:11:42,480
shit.
And they were,

1516
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,700
they only had an.
They're only looking at the big stuff,

1517
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:46,830
but many,
many things went extinct.

1518
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,230
Did you see that bird species?
Small species,

1519
01:11:49,231 --> 01:11:50,920
you know,
it's,

1520
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,650
it's Kinda hard to picture it.
It's just so hard to picture what

1521
01:11:55,651 --> 01:11:57,030
exactly happened.
It's just,

1522
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:00,450
I don't know,
especially in people killing them with

1523
01:12:00,451 --> 01:12:01,240
adult adults.

1524
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,760
Yeah.
Those goofy things.

1525
01:12:02,761 --> 01:12:04,460
Which I mean,
how far can you throw an Atlatl,

1526
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,670
uh,
that people kill stuff?

1527
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:08,570
Forty yards.
I think that's a real phrase.

1528
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:12,150
It'd be like the hulk,
but then the thing they say is,

1529
01:12:12,151 --> 01:12:14,340
you know,
we talked about wildlife in yellowstone

1530
01:12:14,341 --> 01:12:17,490
being habituated.
That wildlife probably would have been

1531
01:12:17,491 --> 01:12:19,800
the other extreme.
They probably would have been like,

1532
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:22,380
uh,
the elk in yellowstone wolves showed up.

1533
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:23,251
Was it like,
Whoa,

1534
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:24,990
what's that cute dog?
Right.

1535
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:28,830
So,
and then they have very low fecundity,

1536
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:31,620
you know,
pack in terms of we're not just talking

1537
01:12:31,621 --> 01:12:32,550
about,
that's a problem.

1538
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:36,270
We're just talking about packing or
you're talking about like a short faced

1539
01:12:36,271 --> 01:12:38,040
bears,
the American Cheetah,

1540
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,840
giant ground sloths on and on and on and
on and on to these guys really hunted to

1541
01:12:42,841 --> 01:12:44,700
extinction.
It's hard to imagine but it's also hard

1542
01:12:44,701 --> 01:12:47,040
to imagine all that shit going to
extinct for any cause.

1543
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:49,920
Well its also coincides with the end of
the ice age,

1544
01:12:49,921 --> 01:12:53,580
so something happened.
Something radical at the end of the ice

1545
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:56,160
age is just an idea that we've created,
right?

1546
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:01,940
Like we did during.
There were interglacial periods,

1547
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:05,580
like if you look at the ice ages are or
the pleistocene,

1548
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,680
right?
There were interglacial periods where

1549
01:13:07,681 --> 01:13:09,600
the water was much higher than it is
now.

1550
01:13:09,601 --> 01:13:12,960
There were interglacial periods when the
water would have been up over the

1551
01:13:12,961 --> 01:13:15,580
pedestal of the Statue of Liberty
Really?

1552
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:19,440
And then shit froze again as like.
But the idea that the pleistocene

1553
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:22,860
holocene transition is just like a.

1554
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:27,210
it's just a point we divided in our
heads,

1555
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:28,680
you know,
we had,

1556
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:33,000
there was many glaciations right?
Time will only tell if we ever see

1557
01:13:33,001 --> 01:13:35,420
another glaciation again,
but I don't know.

1558
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:38,670
And that's one of the things that,
that's one of the things that makes that

1559
01:13:38,671 --> 01:13:43,671
emboldens people who contradict.
One of the things that emboldens people

1560
01:13:44,221 --> 01:13:48,960
who contradict human caused climate
change is that we've been through so

1561
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:51,600
many cycles,
they'll often point out and say,

1562
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:53,490
well,
how do we know this isn't just a normal,

1563
01:13:53,491 --> 01:13:57,990
another warming trend between ice age
periods and then a lot of people pointed

1564
01:13:57,991 --> 01:14:00,630
out and go because there's no evidence
that they ever happened this quickly.

1565
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:03,210
This is like radically fast.
These are things that played out over

1566
01:14:03,211 --> 01:14:05,760
10,000 years.
These aren't things that played out over

1567
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,690
human lifetimes.
You know,

1568
01:14:07,691 --> 01:14:10,920
an interglacial period being a 10,000
year thing.

1569
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:15,100
Interestingly,
interglacial periods are really

1570
01:14:15,101 --> 01:14:20,101
important to understanding all these
issues because interglacial periods in

1571
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:24,280
glacial periods,
mark moments when wildlife could have

1572
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:27,580
come into the new world when wildlife
such as you know,

1573
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:31,660
buffalo and then later elk and other
things when they would have had the

1574
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:36,010
opportunity to come from Asia and
crossed the bering land bridge and come

1575
01:14:36,011 --> 01:14:39,450
down and do our to our continent and
when it would have,

1576
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,690
when they could have not done that.

1577
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:43,150
So when you look at like when did humans
show up?

1578
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:46,000
When did these other things show up?
Like when did the horses disappeared?

1579
01:14:46,001 --> 01:14:48,370
When could they have come down?
One [inaudible] buffalo come down.

1580
01:14:48,371 --> 01:14:50,620
How did elk get here?
You're sort of always looking at

1581
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:56,220
assuming they didn't come down when the
entire north of swerved and 40 feet of

1582
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:58,660
snow and ice,
presuming they came down when it was the

1583
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:02,800
icefree corridor and so you can kind of
fine tune all these comings and goings,

1584
01:15:02,801 --> 01:15:07,801
but looking at moments when there was an
ice record or to come down and so if

1585
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:09,520
it's beautifully intertwined,
man,

1586
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,820
it's so complex and there's no way to
really lock it down yet has no way to

1587
01:15:13,821 --> 01:15:15,170
really.
Totally figured it out yet.

1588
01:15:15,171 --> 01:15:17,870
But it's so fascinating when they find
these animals still.

1589
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:23,340
They just pulled a big giant skull with
tusks out of a ranch in Montana.

1590
01:15:24,501 --> 01:15:26,840
Like really recently.
I think I tweeted it,

1591
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:29,570
I think it was c,
see if you could find it on

1592
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,960
my body.
Found a jaw with the maulers in it,

1593
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:33,270
but

1594
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:34,830
to museum.
Wow.

1595
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:37,920
He just found a couple of years ago he
found it in the tone.

1596
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:42,810
My friend John,
his buddy owns a ranch in Montana and he

1597
01:15:42,811 --> 01:15:45,990
was talking to some.
This might be the same guy.

1598
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,160
Do you know where it was?
No,

1599
01:15:47,161 --> 01:15:47,994
I don't know,
but this was.

1600
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,010
I'm talking about the tusks.
Oh,

1601
01:15:50,011 --> 01:15:50,630
nevermind.
Okay.

1602
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:51,140
They,
they,

1603
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:53,340
they found a dinosaur on his property.
Said the,

1604
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:55,080
uh,
archaeologists came.

1605
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:56,490
What was it?
A paleontologist?

1606
01:15:56,491 --> 01:15:58,860
Paleontologist paleontologist came to
his property.

1607
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:01,680
He said he went for a walk up the hill.
He stopped.

1608
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:05,040
He found something on the ground.
He looked around,

1609
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:07,950
he made some calculations and it came
back to him.

1610
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:09,450
He goes,
congratulations.

1611
01:16:09,451 --> 01:16:11,460
You got a dinosaur on your property.
He was what?

1612
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:13,650
They came back.
They have a fucking t-rex on his

1613
01:16:13,651 --> 01:16:15,930
property.
No one guy got a million and a half

1614
01:16:15,931 --> 01:16:19,850
dollars because they pulled a fucking
t-rex from his property for the

1615
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,240
paleontologist,
found it,

1616
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:24,690
and literally founded in five minutes,
said he started walking around the

1617
01:16:24,691 --> 01:16:27,560
property.
He found a tooth or some sort of chip,

1618
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:30,270
a piece of bone.
He recognized it immediately as being

1619
01:16:30,271 --> 01:16:32,210
dinosaur.
Made some phone calls,

1620
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,410
called some people and next thing you
know,

1621
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,720
like within weeks they had started
excavations.

1622
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:40,290
No shit found a fucking t rex and I was
prepping cars because it was on private

1623
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:42,120
land.
You could sell it a million and a half

1624
01:16:42,121 --> 01:16:43,020
dollars on

1625
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,680
public land Foa.
Once something's fossilized,

1626
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:47,210
you can't touch it.
Yeah,

1627
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,490
that's interesting.
But do I agree?

1628
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:52,400
Cause I don't want to escape your
question about

1629
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:59,110
undoing human caused extinctions.
What else getting at is the animals that

1630
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:05,180
I'm most interested in just from a boy
in a very boyish way.

1631
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:09,010
Are those pleistocene creditors.
Um,

1632
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:14,310
and if I knew,
you know,

1633
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:17,090
if I had the diamond and bullet right
there would tell me that.

1634
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:18,710
Yes,
absolutely.

1635
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:24,130
We lost the mammoth because of human
hunting behaviors at the pleistocene

1636
01:17:24,861 --> 01:17:26,450
holocene transition.
I will be like,

1637
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:28,380
let's bring them sons of bitches back
right now.

1638
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:31,680
Wow.
If you could prove without a shadow of a

1639
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:34,440
doubt that human hunters created that
problem.

1640
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:35,770
Yeah.
And I knew the tech,

1641
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:38,080
like,
let's say the technology was just fail

1642
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:39,390
safe.
You want to talk about some

1643
01:17:39,391 --> 01:17:41,220
controversial.
You think people are up in arms about

1644
01:17:41,221 --> 01:17:45,540
some buffalo hunting around you cut
loose them short faced bears or you

1645
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:47,410
know,
that would be a giant issue.

1646
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:49,060
Yeah.
You think the wolf reintroduction when

1647
01:17:49,061 --> 01:17:51,990
she was shaky?
The short face bear,

1648
01:17:51,991 --> 01:17:53,340
the scary guy.
They have animal.

1649
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,430
That's a huge bear very fast.
Really?

1650
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:57,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

1651
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,111
They,
they were,

1652
01:17:58,111 --> 01:18:01,650
they were a fast runner and they're
bigger than polar bears.

1653
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:02,970
And you know,
there's a,

1654
01:18:02,971 --> 01:18:04,830
the American Cheetah.
Yeah.

1655
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,280
Yeah.
That's the reason why antelope are so

1656
01:18:08,281 --> 01:18:10,290
fast.
That's a theory that the antelope are

1657
01:18:10,291 --> 01:18:13,410
ridiculously fast for any predator.
There's like,

1658
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:18,450
there's speed doesn't make sense through
the context of what's chasing them right

1659
01:18:18,731 --> 01:18:20,710
now.
Why do people call them speed goats

1660
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:22,300
while they haul.
But why goat?

1661
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,210
Because.
Because there I think there's a,

1662
01:18:25,211 --> 01:18:29,380
there's a,
there's a dumb ass reason and there's a

1663
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:33,850
tax nonvocal reason and I know dear
friends of mine on both sides of that

1664
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:38,320
spectrum where I'm fast,
if I put it to my brother who on

1665
01:18:38,321 --> 01:18:40,990
occasion calls him goats,
he'll talk about how taxonomically

1666
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,223
there,
uh,

1667
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,090
you know,
they're distinct.

1668
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:46,510
Like they're the only thing in there.
They're the only thing in their family,

1669
01:18:46,511 --> 01:18:47,344
right?
Um,

1670
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,990
they don't have any close relatives,
but there,

1671
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:53,200
there,
there are only there a horned animal

1672
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:56,320
that sheds its horns and antlers shed
elk,

1673
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:56,951
Moose,
deer.

1674
01:18:56,951 --> 01:18:59,350
All the servants like antler shed horns
don't shed.

1675
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:01,510
Animals carry their horns for their
whole life.

1676
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,800
Like a Kraton a sheath.
But antelope shed their horn.

1677
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:09,880
But it turns out that some people like
to point out that they're like a close

1678
01:19:09,881 --> 01:19:12,730
to a goat.
The goat is close.

1679
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,350
Other people say just because they kind
of looked like goats.

1680
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:18,720
I don't know.
I think it's a derogatory term.

1681
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:21,750
I don't like it really.
I don't like derogatory animal terms.

1682
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,090
The why is goat a derogatory tone?
Well,

1683
01:19:24,091 --> 01:19:26,040
go is what people call the greatest of
all time.

1684
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:28,740
It's the goat.
Now a mountain goat is a noble,

1685
01:19:28,741 --> 01:19:30,080
majestic animal,
right?

1686
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,550
A barnyard go.
I don't think it's noble and Majesta.

1687
01:19:32,551 --> 01:19:34,320
Okay.
And I don't think they're equating it to

1688
01:19:34,321 --> 01:19:35,360
a mountain goat,
right?

1689
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:37,140
The mountain go.
Being as beautiful white,

1690
01:19:37,141 --> 01:19:39,810
fluffy goats will be in a wild animal.
Those are awesome.

1691
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:40,740
Yeah.
It's a wild animal.

1692
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:43,020
And to be like a speed go,
you're saying like,

1693
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:44,100
oh,
it's like a goat,

1694
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:47,250
a lowly barnyard.
Go that hauls ass.

1695
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,770
I was just in his act.
I feel that this derogatory.

1696
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,720
This is a minor issue.
I'll point out.

1697
01:19:51,721 --> 01:19:55,140
But it does bother me.
I don't think it's derogatory to call it

1698
01:19:55,141 --> 01:19:56,450
a go.
But I do think that.

1699
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:59,340
And I haven't met whatever it does.
I haven't met anyone who does think it's

1700
01:19:59,341 --> 01:20:03,570
derogatory.
But it's so funny because mountain goat,

1701
01:20:03,571 --> 01:20:07,470
you agree as a noble animal.
I don't want to you.

1702
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,540
I was in Hawaiian culture everywhere.
Bizarre.

1703
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:10,710
Driving down the road.

1704
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,660
It's fucking goats everywhere.
Which just wild goats.

1705
01:20:12,661 --> 01:20:14,490
And they're like,
they're like a wild animal.

1706
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:16,910
Yeah man.
You already talked about wildlife

1707
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,750
politics.
Hawaii.

1708
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:20,880
Hm?
Do you ever want to get into that?

1709
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:21,990
Yeah,
it's crazy.

1710
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:24,270
That's interesting shit.
Where you have your whole suite of

1711
01:20:24,271 --> 01:20:25,130
mammals is,
uh,

1712
01:20:25,131 --> 01:20:27,060
your whole suite of mammals is all non
native.

1713
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,050
Yeah,
all of them.

1714
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:30,600
But here's the,
here's where it's interesting.

1715
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:34,010
So polynesians colonize the Hawaiian
islands,

1716
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:36,390
like the first people,
the first humans to colonize the

1717
01:20:36,391 --> 01:20:40,800
Hawaiian islands.
Polynesians who carried with them rats.

1718
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:43,440
Dogs,
pigs,

1719
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:47,550
right.
We have native Hawaiians,

1720
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:50,970
right?
Like Hawaiians and indigenous Hawaiians.

1721
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:53,700
People are carrying native rights.
They regard themselves as native

1722
01:20:53,701 --> 01:20:56,220
Hawaiians.
Yet people are always telling them that

1723
01:20:56,221 --> 01:21:01,221
the wildlife is non native,
so you get people that showed up with

1724
01:21:02,551 --> 01:21:06,930
pigs and now the nature conservancy will
get chunks of land in Hawaii and

1725
01:21:06,931 --> 01:21:11,931
eradicate the non natives and the native
Hawaiians be like,

1726
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:14,580
but were contemporaneous with these
animals.

1727
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:17,160
How am I native?
Right,

1728
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:19,740
but you're telling me that the thing I
like to hunt is not native.

1729
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:22,140
It needs to be gotten rid of.
It's ridiculous.

1730
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,780
They should think it is.
Well,

1731
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:28,050
I don't mean to say they like.
It's a unanimously held viewpoint,

1732
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:29,810
but people who hold the viewpoint of
that,

1733
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:33,030
they that they hunt pigs,
their father hunt pigs,

1734
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,830
their grandfather hump pigs.
They're great.

1735
01:21:34,831 --> 01:21:35,221
Great,
great,

1736
01:21:35,221 --> 01:21:36,140
great.
Great grandfather,

1737
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:39,060
hundred pigs.
Now what's the pressure coming from to

1738
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:41,730
eradicate them from agriculture?
No,

1739
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:46,260
it's from people who who are worried
about losing yet more and we've already

1740
01:21:46,261 --> 01:21:47,490
lost,
doesn't know.

1741
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:51,420
Speaking regional extinctions are extra
patients and in some cases extinction

1742
01:21:51,421 --> 01:21:54,870
extinction.
We've lost dozens of species of,

1743
01:21:55,030 --> 01:22:00,030
of Hawaiian Flora and fauna to
considering a wide range of ground

1744
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:05,160
nesting birds have been lost to rats and
pigs.

1745
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,930
So now it's not so much focused on the
animals but,

1746
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:13,260
but flora,
so there are people who are trying to

1747
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:15,780
read who would like to,
and then I get where they're coming

1748
01:22:15,781 --> 01:22:17,820
from,
who would like to restore,

1749
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,350
um,
large areas of,

1750
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:25,830
of native
plant communities in the Hawaiian

1751
01:22:25,831 --> 01:22:27,360
islands because anything,
when you go there,

1752
01:22:27,361 --> 01:22:30,600
all the fruit you see the coconuts are
not native papayas,

1753
01:22:30,601 --> 01:22:32,130
mangoes,
breadfruit,

1754
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:33,240
none of that stuff's native.

1755
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,850
Wow.
It's all introduced.

1756
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,890
It's a p that places a petri dish,
man.

1757
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,620
They got their turkeys,
pheasants,

1758
01:22:40,621 --> 01:22:44,490
chucker,
they're hunting access and everything

1759
01:22:44,491 --> 01:22:46,010
there.
But none of that shit's from there.

1760
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:47,940
So there are some people who look and
they say like,

1761
01:22:47,941 --> 01:22:48,690
we have,
uh,

1762
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:49,250
we have,
uh,

1763
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,540
you know,
ecological responsibility to try to

1764
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:54,480
salvage some part of this.
But meanwhile,

1765
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:58,500
another perspective would be like,
we made this place bloom,

1766
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:01,740
this place oozes with life.
And there's people who,

1767
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:03,610
you know,
they get all their,

1768
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:06,040
they're able to glean all of their

1769
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:11,040
food sources from the island,
from things that their ancestors have

1770
01:23:11,411 --> 01:23:13,510
established on the island,
and it's offensive to them.

1771
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:19,120
Do you know about Darwin visiting the
Galapagos silence and that it's one of

1772
01:23:19,121 --> 01:23:24,121
the ways that he sort of formulated his
theories about evolution and all the

1773
01:23:24,161 --> 01:23:27,190
various variety of wildlife,
uh,

1774
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:31,390
through visiting the Galapagos islands
unintentionally.

1775
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:35,200
People have had seeds that they brought
with them on the bottom of their shoes.

1776
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:36,550
Oh,
I'm sure.

1777
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:39,710
Which is really crazy.
And all these animals and plants are

1778
01:23:39,711 --> 01:23:44,380
either are growing that are non native
and this debate pops up as to what to do

1779
01:23:44,381 --> 01:23:47,110
with them.
And then there's all these turtles that

1780
01:23:47,111 --> 01:23:50,890
live there and there's this debate props
up as to like how to protect these

1781
01:23:50,891 --> 01:23:53,590
turtles.
And they brought in goats to eradicate

1782
01:23:53,591 --> 01:23:55,960
some of the,
some of the plants now.

1783
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:58,480
And there's some people brought goats
over there,

1784
01:23:58,481 --> 01:24:00,890
like some sailors,
brock goats over there as a food source

1785
01:24:00,891 --> 01:24:02,410
and left them on the island figuring,
hey,

1786
01:24:02,411 --> 01:24:03,880
we'll stop back when we need food.

1787
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:06,850
And now they've got goat problems,
so they're trying to figure out how to

1788
01:24:06,851 --> 01:24:08,110
eradicate the goats.
And

1789
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:10,730
you know,
the Judas,

1790
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,450
Judas goat.
That's good.

1791
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,280
Well they take one goat and they,
uh,

1792
01:24:15,281 --> 01:24:18,460
they sterilize that goat and so that
goat can't breed,

1793
01:24:18,461 --> 01:24:21,310
but that goat will find all the other
goats and hang out with that goat and

1794
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:24,700
they put a radio collar on the little
fucker and then he lets them know where

1795
01:24:24,701 --> 01:24:26,890
the other goats are and then they gunned
down those goats

1796
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:29,441
and he goes,
well,

1797
01:24:29,441 --> 01:24:32,560
I to go find some other goats.
And he goes and finds the other one.

1798
01:24:32,561 --> 01:24:33,070
And they're like,
oh,

1799
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:35,500
we found him.
And the thing is the poor guy,

1800
01:24:35,501 --> 01:24:38,320
I don't even know if he's like,
he's like,

1801
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:40,750
man,
am I lucky they show up in his

1802
01:24:40,751 --> 01:24:42,030
helicopter that,
that,

1803
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:45,250
that may have taken them out like
platoon style.

1804
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:45,941
Yo,
the writer,

1805
01:24:45,941 --> 01:24:47,500
Tom Robbins,
um,

1806
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:50,780
is he still alive?
Skinny legs and all.

1807
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,690
I think he jitterbug perfume.
Yeah,

1808
01:24:52,691 --> 01:24:54,220
I think he's alive.
You know,

1809
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:55,600
he was talking about.
And one of his books,

1810
01:24:55,601 --> 01:24:58,540
he talks about Hawaii,
how Hawaii had a rat problem.

1811
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:04,260
Then they brought in the mongoose and
they had a mongoose problem and he makes

1812
01:25:05,591 --> 01:25:08,590
the joke that we had a crime problem and
we brought in cops.

1813
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:17,290
Well that's sort of what Australia did.
Australia brought in Fox to deal with

1814
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:18,970
the rabbits.
They brought in rabbits.

1815
01:25:18,971 --> 01:25:21,370
The rabbits got out of control.
They brought in Fox and deal with the

1816
01:25:21,371 --> 01:25:24,100
rabbits,
the Fox already in ground nesting birds.

1817
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:28,240
And they brought in cats as well.
They have a huge feral cat problem in

1818
01:25:28,241 --> 01:25:31,180
Australia to the point where they're
hunting magazines are really bizarre

1819
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:36,450
because holding up cats like what?
Like my friend Adam Green tree lives in

1820
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:39,250
Australia and you know,
it's,

1821
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:43,060
it's a crazy place because it's similar
in a lot of ways that Hawaii is,

1822
01:25:43,061 --> 01:25:45,400
that a lot of the animals they or not
native,

1823
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:50,440
but they're hunting magazines are filled
with fucking dogs and cats and shit.

1824
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:55,000
It's just weird to literally shaken up
Mary if you left one of those on an

1825
01:25:55,001 --> 01:25:57,490
airplane.
So the next passenger to find while I

1826
01:25:57,491 --> 01:26:00,610
was on an airplane and uh,
I got to the part where the guy was

1827
01:26:00,611 --> 01:26:03,670
holding up the cat grip and grin and I
just turned the page real quick.

1828
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:03,980
Come

1829
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,650
on.
Fucking Jesus is heavy.

1830
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:09,600
Yeah.
The non native thing is,

1831
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:10,640
uh,
it,

1832
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:13,350
it amazes me.
Our inability

1833
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:17,050
to anticipate,
or I guess it's Kang.

1834
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:19,620
I'm going to say something.
It's like weirdly contradictory,

1835
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:23,760
our inability to anticipate unintended
consequences,

1836
01:26:23,761 --> 01:26:25,890
which doesn't entirely make sense,
but you see what I'm getting at.

1837
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:26,753
Right,
right.

1838
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:28,223
Yeah.

1839
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:33,400
Well there's no forethought to bring in
boxes or cats like and say,

1840
01:26:33,741 --> 01:26:36,340
well they're just gonna eat the rabbit
that we left behind.

1841
01:26:36,341 --> 01:26:36,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

1842
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:38,460
Had Your fucking mind.
They're gonna eat everything.

1843
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:42,560
I kid you not see that coming.
Don't you know what a cat does?

1844
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:43,521
No.
That's killed things.

1845
01:26:43,521 --> 01:26:45,240
You can't even throw a ball of yarn in
front of a fucking.

1846
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:45,990
Yeah.
I mean,

1847
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:49,090
it Kinda doesn't end like we're doing.
We're doing it now.

1848
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,640
Something we just don't.
We won't know yet.

1849
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:56,800
In 10 years we'll be there 20 years.
We'll be goofing on.

1850
01:26:56,801 --> 01:26:59,440
Something we're doing right now that we
think is a good idea probably,

1851
01:26:59,441 --> 01:27:00,274
right?
Yeah.

1852
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:03,250
Well we like.
Can you believe those dumb asses?

1853
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Yeah.
In 2016 thought x,

1854
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,520
I have some theories about what those
things might be,

1855
01:27:09,521 --> 01:27:10,354
but I mean,
you know,

1856
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:11,763
we're not done

1857
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:13,590
well.
Commercial sales,

1858
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:17,070
commercial,
large scale agriculture in a way is not

1859
01:27:17,071 --> 01:27:18,600
only just really,
really recent.

1860
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:22,680
It's completely unnatural to have these
giant swaths of land.

1861
01:27:22,681 --> 01:27:24,470
It's filled with corn.
Yeah.

1862
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:27,960
Like monoculture stuff's very unnatural.
So people that think about like,

1863
01:27:27,961 --> 01:27:28,441
oh,
I'm,

1864
01:27:28,441 --> 01:27:29,700
you know,
I'm eating vegetables,

1865
01:27:29,701 --> 01:27:33,660
I'm eating natural and I'm not a part of
this whole factory farm system.

1866
01:27:33,661 --> 01:27:34,680
What the fuck?
You're not.

1867
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:36,960
You're a part of factory agriculture
system.

1868
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:39,390
If you're eating corn,
if you're buying corn,

1869
01:27:39,391 --> 01:27:41,400
you're eating corn on the cob thinking
you're all healthy.

1870
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:44,640
That shit is coming from a really
unnatural place.

1871
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:48,900
It's coming from this ground that has
been filled up with all this nitrogen

1872
01:27:48,901 --> 01:27:51,150
that's been sucked out of the air
through the harbor method.

1873
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,160
They've,
they've dumped it into the earth because

1874
01:27:53,161 --> 01:27:55,920
the earth earth's been depleted with
minerals to the point where they're no

1875
01:27:55,921 --> 01:28:00,360
longer supports growth of plants unless
you add stuff to it and then you have

1876
01:28:00,361 --> 01:28:04,050
these large scale machines that they
need to attend to this stuff.

1877
01:28:04,051 --> 01:28:06,870
And there's nothing natural about large
scale agriculture.

1878
01:28:06,871 --> 01:28:09,570
No,
we just don't consider it because we

1879
01:28:09,571 --> 01:28:14,571
consider factory farming when it comes
to living animals as being horrific,

1880
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:17,070
you know,
whether it's pigs or cows or chickens,

1881
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:19,980
that disturbs almost anybody with a
conscience,

1882
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:24,780
but we don't think twice about the
consequences of large scale agriculture

1883
01:28:24,781 --> 01:28:27,160
on actual wildlife and wild

1884
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:30,940
when you picture that we have,
I mean much vaster than this,

1885
01:28:30,941 --> 01:28:35,941
but we have entire counties that support
a single species of plant of plant.

1886
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:40,580
Oftentimes a single species of a non
native plant.

1887
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:43,000
Corn.
Corn is.

1888
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:46,220
It's kind of a native,
you know,

1889
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:48,680
it's derived from maze.
It's like kind of a native species.

1890
01:28:48,681 --> 01:28:53,681
So oftentimes it's like entire county's
given over to a single non native plant.

1891
01:28:56,720 --> 01:29:00,620
Well isn't corn sort of like looking at
a domestic dog and saying,

1892
01:29:00,621 --> 01:29:01,980
well that domestic dog as

1893
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,100
a wild animal?
Yeah,

1894
01:29:03,101 --> 01:29:03,491
I really,
I,

1895
01:29:03,491 --> 01:29:05,970
I don't even know,
like if you took someone from

1896
01:29:05,971 --> 01:29:09,840
pre-colombian times and showed them a
corn cob,

1897
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:10,703
I don't know that they,
they,

1898
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:12,590
I don't think that they would probably
recognize that.

1899
01:29:12,591 --> 01:29:13,980
You wouldn't know what the fuck that
was.

1900
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:16,170
They were dealing with a corn that was
more.

1901
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,740
It was.
That was a smaller than when you are

1902
01:29:19,741 --> 01:29:22,350
making a stir fry and get the little
baby corn things,

1903
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:24,030
whether that's small,
small,

1904
01:29:24,031 --> 01:29:24,864
little things.
Yeah.

1905
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:27,990
Wow.
They can't even tell like they can't

1906
01:29:27,991 --> 01:29:30,990
tell how it even came to be.
Some people have a theory that it was

1907
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:35,430
bred from a grass.
It's like they're like the lineage of

1908
01:29:35,431 --> 01:29:38,190
corn is hard to track.
Wow.

1909
01:29:38,191 --> 01:29:41,610
So was this native Americans that did
this where they figured out how to

1910
01:29:41,611 --> 01:29:44,700
splice these plants together and tie.
There's a book,

1911
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:46,680
I can't remember the name of the book
that gets into it,

1912
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:50,970
but just trying to like track down sort
of the history of corn and how it came

1913
01:29:50,971 --> 01:29:51,540
to be.

1914
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:52,890
You know,
the oftentimes points you would

1915
01:29:52,891 --> 01:29:56,820
domestication of animals and plants.
Sometimes it was sort of an accidental

1916
01:29:56,821 --> 01:29:57,870
domestication,
you know,

1917
01:29:57,871 --> 01:29:59,280
like you'd go out and gather something,
right,

1918
01:29:59,281 --> 01:30:01,710
and you bring it home,
you process it near your home,

1919
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,230
you're scattering seed,
right?

1920
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,870
And eventually you're like creating
these things.

1921
01:30:06,871 --> 01:30:07,561
But yeah,
corns,

1922
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:10,890
difficult to track the lineage of corn
is not clear.

1923
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:15,510
It's just so bizarre what kind of a
foothold it has an American culture to

1924
01:30:15,511 --> 01:30:16,130
everything,
man.

1925
01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:17,340
It's,
everything's crazy.

1926
01:30:17,341 --> 01:30:21,960
I recently interviewed for a documentary
project we're working on.

1927
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:24,780
I interviewed a animal he's at,
he's from California.

1928
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:27,180
He's an animal rights activist and a,
he's a,

1929
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:32,210
he teaches animal ethics and um,
he has a brand of veganism that I think

1930
01:30:32,491 --> 01:30:34,050
it would be refreshing to.
You should have this guy.

1931
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:35,400
I keep telling him you should have on
your show.

1932
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:36,650
But,
uh,

1933
01:30:36,650 --> 01:30:37,830
he has a barrier.
What's his name?

1934
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:40,650
His name's Robert Jones.
He has a very,

1935
01:30:40,651 --> 01:30:44,880
uh,
refreshing sort of veganism.

1936
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:48,290
I'd had this dude over dinner.
Really?

1937
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,040
Yeah.
But,

1938
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:49,873
but,
but he,

1939
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:52,870
he doesn't,
he doesn't hold out ideas that he's peer

1940
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:56,190
because of what we're talking about
right.

1941
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:59,960
Like he's,
he's educated enough about agriculture

1942
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:05,000
and educated enough about the inherent
struggle,

1943
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:08,540
the inherent life and death through all
food production did.

1944
01:31:08,541 --> 01:31:09,710
He doesn't think like,
oh,

1945
01:31:09,711 --> 01:31:13,550
I have all the answers.
I am the gentle kind one because he's

1946
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:18,551
seen cornfields like he knows like
you're churning your violently churning

1947
01:31:18,891 --> 01:31:21,860
the land with the equipment.
Things are dying when you grow

1948
01:31:21,861 --> 01:31:26,861
vegetables like we're in,
we're in meshed in a in a cycle of life

1949
01:31:26,931 --> 01:31:28,730
and death.
That is inescapable.

1950
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:30,360
His point,
we're not on.

1951
01:31:30,361 --> 01:31:32,350
I don't want to totally steal the guy's
pointing.

1952
01:31:32,351 --> 01:31:37,351
He'd do a better job explain himself,
but his point is that if we agree that

1953
01:31:38,211 --> 01:31:41,060
we should minimize suffering,
right?

1954
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,490
There are steps we can take to minimize
suffering.

1955
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:45,650
Not Saying that I've got it.
Answer is no,

1956
01:31:45,651 --> 01:31:49,700
I've got it figured out,
but if we want to minimize the suffering

1957
01:31:49,701 --> 01:31:54,110
of sentient beings,
then that's a conversation we should

1958
01:31:54,111 --> 01:31:54,920
have.

1959
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,740
The best thing that he said,
the best thing that he said in

1960
01:31:57,741 --> 01:31:59,920
explaining the animal rights movement,
which I've always been a little bit

1961
01:31:59,921 --> 01:32:04,921
baffled by,
is he gets into this idea of he uses the

1962
01:32:05,711 --> 01:32:07,780
term speciesism.
Yeah.

1963
01:32:07,781 --> 01:32:08,830
I've heard that one.
Yeah.

1964
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:11,140
So you know,
we had,

1965
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:16,810
we've dealt with and deal with racism
we've dealt with and deal with sexism

1966
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:19,930
and we are,
he would argue,

1967
01:32:19,931 --> 01:32:21,370
I think he would say we're on the cusp
of,

1968
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:26,440
of tackling our problem with speciesism
and he would say like if you went to

1969
01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:27,770
someone like,
you know,

1970
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:31,840
if you went to the Mississippi Delta,
you know,

1971
01:32:31,841 --> 01:32:35,590
in the,
in the 17 and late 17 hundreds and said

1972
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:36,490
to someone like,
Hey,

1973
01:32:36,491 --> 01:32:39,280
you know,
have you ever thought about the fact

1974
01:32:39,281 --> 01:32:41,560
that uh,
you know,

1975
01:32:41,561 --> 01:32:43,930
you kind of like own and abuse these
people.

1976
01:32:43,931 --> 01:32:46,840
Have you ever thought about how they're
like people too,

1977
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:49,000
you know,
they're like you and me.

1978
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:51,220
He was,
he was saying like,

1979
01:32:51,221 --> 01:32:52,960
the guy wouldn't be able to cope with
what you were saying.

1980
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:54,483
He'd be like,
oh,

1981
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:56,440
clearly.
I mean,

1982
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:01,560
come on,
any idiot could tell you that that slave

1983
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:04,450
is not.
I mean,

1984
01:33:04,451 --> 01:33:05,680
come on.
Right,

1985
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,870
right.
He says,

1986
01:33:07,871 --> 01:33:09,160
that's where we're at right now with
animals.

1987
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,020
Like when I say it to you,
you're like,

1988
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:13,390
well,
clearly we're so.

1989
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,560
Does he aim to stop animal on animal
crime?

1990
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:20,800
You know,
I asked him about that and um,

1991
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:23,440
that was one of the things that I,
at the end of our conversation,

1992
01:33:23,441 --> 01:33:24,190
I even said to him,
I'm like,

1993
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:28,870
you got a couple of things you need to
work on because he didn't have a great

1994
01:33:28,871 --> 01:33:30,910
one for that.
Another one that he didn't have a great

1995
01:33:30,911 --> 01:33:32,170
one for his.
He had

1996
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:36,580
nothing to,
not that he ended a great one now that I

1997
01:33:36,581 --> 01:33:38,140
was like trying to stump him because
he's,

1998
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,000
he's,
he's a very intelligent,

1999
01:33:40,001 --> 01:33:42,130
well thought person and very respectful
to people that you talking.

2000
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:45,070
Do even people that disagree with them.
I have nothing but admiration for the

2001
01:33:45,071 --> 01:33:46,590
guy.
But we had a,

2002
01:33:46,591 --> 01:33:49,860
a conversation that,
that I,

2003
01:33:49,861 --> 01:33:54,861
that I was not totally satisfied with
where he has a deal of reverence it

2004
01:33:55,301 --> 01:33:56,740
seems.
And again,

2005
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,970
at the risk of putting words in his
mouth,

2006
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:01,120
he has a reverence for like indigenous
hunting cultures,

2007
01:34:01,150 --> 01:34:02,920
right?
That they had like this sort of respect.

2008
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:07,390
They had a respect for animals that we
don't have and somehow that made it okay

2009
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:09,130
for them.
Like they had a spiritual connection.

2010
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:11,740
And so that made that okay.
And we don't have that,

2011
01:34:11,741 --> 01:34:14,260
so we're not okay.
And I asked them about are you able to

2012
01:34:14,261 --> 01:34:19,261
identify the point in human development
and cultural development?

2013
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:22,510
What is the point when you're supposed
to give up the chase?

2014
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:27,880
Like at what point do you have a
responsibility to stop hunting because

2015
01:34:27,881 --> 01:34:31,900
you're saying that it is okay.
For some people it's absolutely not okay

2016
01:34:31,901 --> 01:34:34,930
for us now when should we have made the
jump?

2017
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:38,470
Because earlier Tom Bout like the
Spanish,

2018
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:41,740
there's a.
there's a situation where the Spanish

2019
01:34:41,741 --> 01:34:45,640
had gone into in the American southwest
and we're trying to,

2020
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:51,030
as they called it civilize southwestern
tribes and they were building homes for

2021
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:54,580
them,
trying to instruct them in religion,

2022
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:58,130
trying to create schools for them,
trying to provide them with

2023
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:03,130
the tools of the agrarian lifestyle.
And they would write letters back to the

2024
01:35:05,151 --> 01:35:09,410
king complaining about how these people
refuse to stop,

2025
01:35:09,411 --> 01:35:13,040
go hunting.
Like you give them a chance and he sons

2026
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:16,130
of bitches take off to go hunt and here
we are giving them everything they need

2027
01:35:16,131 --> 01:35:18,710
to be sedentary and they just won't get
with the program.

2028
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,620
So there is this struggle where people
were like,

2029
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:25,910
you're supposed to be like,
I think some people expect you,

2030
01:35:25,911 --> 01:35:28,790
like if you're a human,
they think that the end result of

2031
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:32,960
humanness is that you like wind up not
hunting,

2032
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:37,010
that it's sort of the goal of
civilizations to make you not a hunter.

2033
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:41,630
And I think he's a little bit guilty of
that because he thinks it is okay for

2034
01:35:41,631 --> 01:35:43,610
some people and where he runs into
trouble.

2035
01:35:43,611 --> 01:35:47,840
As he talks about that.
I asked him about ethics.

2036
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:49,700
He says,
but the animal doesn't care about your

2037
01:35:49,701 --> 01:35:51,500
ethics to him.
He's dying.

2038
01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:56,730
If he dies and you have a good feeling
in your heart or if he dies and you have

2039
01:35:56,731 --> 01:35:58,500
a bad feeling in your heart,
he's dead.

2040
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:02,400
It doesn't matter.
They don't know what trip you're on your

2041
01:36:02,410 --> 01:36:05,070
car.
They suffer the same regardless of your

2042
01:36:05,071 --> 01:36:08,070
motivations.
And which leads me to want to point out,

2043
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:10,020
okay,
but the indigenous cultures that you

2044
01:36:10,021 --> 01:36:11,580
say,
it's okay for them to hunt.

2045
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:15,630
Their animals are suffering to the
animals they killed.

2046
01:36:15,631 --> 01:36:18,540
Don't know that they're being killed by
indigenous peoples and therefore it

2047
01:36:18,541 --> 01:36:20,280
makes the suffering more palatable for
them.

2048
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:24,980
They're dying.
So there are some traps there that,

2049
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:27,360
that,
that to me were answered in a

2050
01:36:27,361 --> 01:36:29,160
satisfactory way.
Does any of that make sense?

2051
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:30,090
Yeah,
absolutely.

2052
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:35,120
It's a very messy situation if you want
to try to confine behavior that way and

2053
01:36:35,551 --> 01:36:38,550
you want to impart moral judgment on
people because what do you do with

2054
01:36:38,551 --> 01:36:40,440
people with pets?
We do it.

2055
01:36:40,441 --> 01:36:41,880
People that have cats.
I mean he has,

2056
01:36:41,881 --> 01:36:43,860
he has companion animals.
He has some very good.

2057
01:36:43,861 --> 01:36:45,480
He has good stuff to say about that.
Yeah,

2058
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:46,600
it was very interesting.
So saved.

2059
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:49,260
What does you have to say with those
animals that are mistreated and confined

2060
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:51,780
and ground up in the food?
He wouldn't like that,

2061
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:53,440
but I,
I don't know if you feel.

2062
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:55,410
I,
I would imagine,

2063
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:57,020
um,
I feel,

2064
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:58,600
I feel kind of like you can feed your
cats,

2065
01:36:58,601 --> 01:37:03,090
have a vegan diet and I would imagine in
my act about it because I got into it

2066
01:37:03,091 --> 01:37:05,670
because I found out I got,
I got harassed by someone online and I

2067
01:37:05,671 --> 01:37:09,420
went to their twitter page and it said
Hashtag Vegan cat and I went,

2068
01:37:09,421 --> 01:37:12,720
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
And then I found this entire community

2069
01:37:12,721 --> 01:37:15,450
of people that feed their cats vegan
food.

2070
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:18,810
The problem is the cats go blind.
They die

2071
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:20,760
like that.
He didn't,

2072
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:22,830
he wasn't that interested in an
argument.

2073
01:37:22,890 --> 01:37:24,480
And when I was saying to him like,
would you,

2074
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:29,010
do you feel that we should separate
predatory animals from pray and put them

2075
01:37:29,011 --> 01:37:31,460
on like a soy diet?
And he just thought I'll.

2076
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:35,160
And I don't understand why he felt that
was being like ridiculous for the sake.

2077
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:37,630
Well it is,
but how you're going to see those stats.

2078
01:37:37,631 --> 01:37:38,950
It's a real quick question.
I mean,

2079
01:37:38,951 --> 01:37:39,820
why you,
you're,

2080
01:37:39,821 --> 01:37:42,400
you're,
you're taking this cat and you're

2081
01:37:42,401 --> 01:37:44,860
putting this cat above the animals that
it eats.

2082
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:47,710
Your deciding that these chickens and
the fish and all the different things

2083
01:37:47,711 --> 01:37:49,420
that you need to grind up to make cat
food.

2084
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:53,590
That's okay because you love this cat.
You have a hierarchy of animal life and

2085
01:37:53,591 --> 01:37:55,680
we all have a hierarchy of life.
Vegans.

2086
01:37:55,681 --> 01:37:56,040
I've seen

2087
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,110
vegans slap mosquitoes.
I've seen it.

2088
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:01,140
I've seen that.
I've seen them kill ants.

2089
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:03,090
You know,
there was a lady I used to live near

2090
01:38:03,091 --> 01:38:05,280
[inaudible].
The lady that ran the Ashram was

2091
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:08,310
spraying bug spray with the from.
It's a Buddhist temple.

2092
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:11,340
It's okay.
And she was still live in a house next

2093
01:38:11,341 --> 01:38:11,800
to it.
Oh,

2094
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:12,960
next door to it,
sorry.

2095
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:15,420
Um,
and um,

2096
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:18,870
she used to spray bug spray on the ants
and I was like,

2097
01:38:18,871 --> 01:38:21,210
what the fuck you on the ant on the
answer to kill the ants.

2098
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:23,040
She was killing him and I go,
what are you doing?

2099
01:38:23,041 --> 01:38:23,581
She's like,
well,

2100
01:38:23,581 --> 01:38:26,040
we don't like to.
But they get into our food and like,

2101
01:38:26,041 --> 01:38:30,210
Holy Shit,
like you're a vegetarian who's committed

2102
01:38:30,211 --> 01:38:33,230
to a Buddhist life of do no harm,
but yet you're,

2103
01:38:33,630 --> 01:38:36,540
there's no way around this.
You have to poison these fucking ends

2104
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:40,050
with death from the sky that comes out
of these containers.

2105
01:38:40,051 --> 01:38:43,680
These metal containers is aerosol
containers of death.

2106
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:46,170
This is,
but this is a bizarre lines that we

2107
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:49,410
draw,
but as long as I am putting my,

2108
01:38:49,450 --> 01:38:52,110
uh,
taken the liberty of putting myself in

2109
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:54,840
Robert and Joe and Wethis is Robert
Jones,

2110
01:38:54,841 --> 01:38:57,630
his position,
I think that he would have some

2111
01:38:57,631 --> 01:39:02,631
interesting stuff to say about,
about this conversation we're having

2112
01:39:03,631 --> 01:39:06,360
when we're like,
because some harm happens.

2113
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,460
Then let's just say fuck it,
and we'll open up the gates.

2114
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:12,061
Well,
no,

2115
01:39:12,061 --> 01:39:16,740
but let's talk about life.
Is his life in a small form more

2116
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:20,160
insignificant or less significant than
an elk?

2117
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:23,280
Like,
who decides that an ant is less

2118
01:39:23,281 --> 01:39:25,440
significant than an hour?
If I shoot one elk,

2119
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:27,870
I can eat it for a year.
That's one life,

2120
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:30,990
one life for a year.
You don't like ants getting on your

2121
01:39:30,991 --> 01:39:35,310
peanut butter and Jelly Sandwich.
So you spray a whole colony of these

2122
01:39:35,311 --> 01:39:38,550
fuckers.
You've killed thousands of life forces.

2123
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:40,520
And even ruling out the insect thing.
I've ever,

2124
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:43,040
uh,
a guy that wrote a,

2125
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:45,180
a pretty scathing review.
I think he might've been,

2126
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:46,170
it might've been.
I came,

2127
01:39:46,171 --> 01:39:48,330
remember it was in the Wall Street
Journal or somewhere you,

2128
01:39:48,331 --> 01:39:51,510
this guy wrote a pretty scathing review
of my third book and,

2129
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:57,240
and there is like just the number of
animals this guy has killed about me.

2130
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,710
Right.
I remember thinking if you go and get a

2131
01:40:01,711 --> 01:40:06,660
12 pack of mcnuggets,
how many chickens,

2132
01:40:07,810 --> 01:40:12,810
how you sorted out the parts,
you're probably eating hundreds of

2133
01:40:13,681 --> 01:40:15,360
chickens probably.
Yeah.

2134
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:16,650
There's,
it's all scraps.

2135
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,050
It's emulsified.
Scrap.

2136
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,580
Yeah.
They're not like,

2137
01:40:20,710 --> 01:40:22,470
okay,
we're going to take this chicken here

2138
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:25,530
and we're going to produce 30 nuggets.
Well,

2139
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,650
my problem is they never turned that
force on themselves.

2140
01:40:28,651 --> 01:40:32,400
They never turned that high powered
vision of,

2141
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:34,290
you know,
the consequences of their actions on

2142
01:40:34,291 --> 01:40:36,300
themselves.
If someone's talking about like,

2143
01:40:36,301 --> 01:40:39,060
if this guy is a Vegan and he's a
vegetarian and he's talking about how

2144
01:40:39,061 --> 01:40:41,430
many animals you've killed,
how many animals are you responsible

2145
01:40:41,431 --> 01:40:42,480
for,
for your fucking,

2146
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:45,330
your whole wheat.
He wasn't even,

2147
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:46,530
he wasn't he.
He was.

2148
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:47,960
So he was a mediator.
Well,

2149
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:50,280
that's preposterous.
That's Ricky Gervais'.

2150
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:54,240
It's Ricky Gervais' constantly talks
hunters

2151
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:59,480
and hunting the guy who eats meat,
like there's so many weird laws and I,

2152
01:41:00,441 --> 01:41:04,120
I get it that he doesn't think people
should hunt animals just for trophies.

2153
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:07,210
And I agree,
but it's very rarely do these animals

2154
01:41:07,211 --> 01:41:09,240
get hunted just for trophies.
Like can you,

2155
01:41:09,241 --> 01:41:13,170
if you shoot a fucking elephant,
the village eats the elephant when

2156
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:16,180
you're feeding hundreds of people with
that elephant.

2157
01:41:16,190 --> 01:41:19,610
And I'll point out too,
and I do all the time pro elephant

2158
01:41:19,670 --> 01:41:21,230
shooting.
It's illegal.

2159
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:21,700
No,
I,

2160
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:25,510
I like,
we're going to talk about yellowstone

2161
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,420
syndrome.
I almost,

2162
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:28,640
I'm almost having a personal.
I'm,

2163
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:31,670
I'm almost,
I'm taking a couple year long break from

2164
01:41:31,671 --> 01:41:36,010
discussing wildlife in Africa.
Really just black

2165
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:38,660
now.
The your article that you wrote was one

2166
01:41:38,661 --> 01:41:42,500
of my favorite on that subject and it
was right around the time that the

2167
01:41:42,501 --> 01:41:45,020
Cecil,
the lion thing was going down and it

2168
01:41:45,021 --> 01:41:48,520
also referenced that Kendall Jones girl
who uh,

2169
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:50,430
got a lot of hate online because she
had,

2170
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:53,380
she was a Texas cheerleader and she was
really cute and I think

2171
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:57,070
yeah,
people hate a good looking woman hunting

2172
01:41:57,071 --> 01:41:59,670
in Africa.
Big Smile on her face and do not.

2173
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:02,690
They do not like some dude,
like did a real good and heating and

2174
01:42:02,691 --> 01:42:05,380
cooling and like my hands aren't going
to go a lot.

2175
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:07,131
People are like,
yeah,

2176
01:42:07,131 --> 01:42:09,440
that's fucking cool.
Hot Girls.

2177
01:42:09,441 --> 01:42:11,330
Hot American girls don't go there.
Well,

2178
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:13,070
and it's also like,
what are you shooting?

2179
01:42:13,071 --> 01:42:16,070
If you're over there and you're shooting
a Kudu and you're going to eat it and

2180
01:42:16,071 --> 01:42:17,690
you know,
you feed the villages every as well.

2181
01:42:17,691 --> 01:42:20,710
It is an antelope that's okay.
This is traditional.

2182
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:23,990
Something that we owe.
We're going to talk about the hierarchy

2183
01:42:24,110 --> 01:42:27,930
because we spent a lot of time at work
work when we're out filming mediator.

2184
01:42:27,950 --> 01:42:30,740
We spent a lot of time talking about the
hierarchy because for instance,

2185
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:33,740
we have a camera guy who worked with
Rick Smith,

2186
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:37,100
has a long professional history and
working with wildlife,

2187
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:40,160
filming wildlife and uh,
didn't grow up hunting.

2188
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,180
Um,
he,

2189
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,070
he,
he,

2190
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:44,300
he,
he's coming around,

2191
01:42:44,301 --> 01:42:47,300
he's curious about it,
but he asked a lot of good questions and

2192
01:42:47,301 --> 01:42:51,600
we were looking.
We had killed a Moose and um,

2193
01:42:51,650 --> 01:42:53,090
the next day it happened.
We were up in,

2194
01:42:53,091 --> 01:42:54,090
uh,
in Alaska.

2195
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:57,350
We killed a moose in the next day.
We rolled our camp and having to go near

2196
01:42:57,351 --> 01:43:02,351
there and there was a wolverine dragging
off Moose parts when you talked about

2197
01:43:02,571 --> 01:43:04,070
this on your podcast.
Yeah,

2198
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:05,810
it's great story.
Rick was like,

2199
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:10,100
and you're allowed in that area between
September one and March 31st you're

2200
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:11,210
allowed to kill your lot.
Oh,

2201
01:43:11,211 --> 01:43:13,100
Wolverine.
Um,

2202
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:15,520
and my friend bought boat and you know,
he,

2203
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:18,650
he has eaten and enjoys wolverine meat
and the hides,

2204
01:43:18,651 --> 01:43:20,620
as we all know what phenomenal the
height.

2205
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:24,560
I don't think we all know that well,
digital listening to this,

2206
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:29,410
like we all know traditionally parkers
are trimmed with Wolverine because

2207
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:32,880
Wolverine will not freeze up when Scott
Frost on it by trim,

2208
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:34,310
demean the,
around the hood,

2209
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:35,173
around the hood.

2210
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:36,710
When your exhale and you're.
Yeah,

2211
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:38,830
stuff gets fraud.
Will Ring.

2212
01:43:38,870 --> 01:43:40,100
Doesn't frost up.
Wow.

2213
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:41,110
So is that going to be used?
I don't know.

2214
01:43:41,111 --> 01:43:43,790
I don't know why it was a hollow hair,
but I don't know what it is about it

2215
01:43:43,791 --> 01:43:45,560
that it resists.
This fraud resists for us.

2216
01:43:45,561 --> 01:43:47,240
So anyways,
we're kicking around.

2217
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:48,610
I'll,
I'll,

2218
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:50,600
I'll tell the end.
First day we didn't shoot the bull ring

2219
01:43:50,601 --> 01:43:52,260
but we were just about,
you know,

2220
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:55,400
we legally could have gone and take a
crack at it.

2221
01:43:55,550 --> 01:43:57,680
Did you have an opportunity to do so?
Yeah,

2222
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:00,890
we would have had to have acted quickly,
but yes.

2223
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:03,590
Or You could have staked it out and just
waited for him to come back because he

2224
01:44:03,591 --> 01:44:04,940
wanted to.
He's a little thief.

2225
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:06,980
He's stealing your Moose,
but we already butchered it.

2226
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:08,990
Right.
He was taking the hooves.

2227
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:09,740
Oh,
okay.

2228
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:10,520
Guts.
Right.

2229
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:13,250
But you're a leader,
so he's taken bone.

2230
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,950
He actually stole two our marathons
because we then have the fucker cause

2231
01:44:15,951 --> 01:44:16,820
he,
we took,

2232
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:21,940
we took the four big marrow bones and he
wound up getting over on another night

2233
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:26,180
at dark and stoled some of our marrow
bones out of our cash.

2234
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:28,910
But we didn't see it happen.
Anyhow,

2235
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:32,720
Rick's point now,
I don't think you should mess with like,

2236
01:44:32,721 --> 01:44:35,950
he's like,
that's an animal that I think is off and

2237
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:36,660
we're like,
why is that?

2238
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:37,041
He's like,
well,

2239
01:44:37,041 --> 01:44:39,710
they Rome.
One of the things he was talking about,

2240
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:40,581
he was like,
man,

2241
01:44:40,581 --> 01:44:42,320
they cover so much ground.
You know,

2242
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:43,930
they'll have a home range,
you know,

2243
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:46,640
they'll go 250 miles.
It's like,

2244
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:49,400
yeah,
but we just killed a Caribou and Caribou

2245
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:54,110
go a thousand miles hundreds of miles.
So it's not distance traveled.

2246
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:56,300
No,
it's just a,

2247
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:57,930
it's just something,
you know.

2248
01:44:58,060 --> 01:44:59,180
It's like,
yeah,

2249
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:00,710
it's just something.
Well,

2250
01:45:00,711 --> 01:45:02,660
people are pairs,
of course.

2251
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:05,300
The way you describe it.
Charismatic megafauna.

2252
01:45:05,330 --> 01:45:05,860
Yeah,
that's,

2253
01:45:05,860 --> 01:45:07,340
that's not my term,
but it's a great.

2254
01:45:07,341 --> 01:45:10,090
I hats off to whoever did.
I'm sure you could find out who invented

2255
01:45:10,091 --> 01:45:12,500
the charismatic megafauna there's
attributed to you.

2256
01:45:12,501 --> 01:45:13,730
So I'm going to leave it with,
you know,

2257
01:45:13,731 --> 01:45:16,130
I didn't come up with it.
I heard a linguist one day.

2258
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:19,070
You could find it.
Hurdle linguists one day talking about,

2259
01:45:19,190 --> 01:45:19,560
uh,
he,

2260
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,800
he was interested in tracking where
things come from.

2261
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:23,450
That would be an easy case,
but you know,

2262
01:45:23,451 --> 01:45:28,451
what he was interested in tracking was a
waitresses saying,

2263
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:30,410
are you still working on that?

2264
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:36,710
Because there was a time when no one
said that and then all of a sudden

2265
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:41,000
everyone said it
and he was interested.

2266
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:43,070
Where did,
are you still working on that?

2267
01:45:43,071 --> 01:45:45,550
Come from the one mouth that it first
came out of.

2268
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:46,730
So yeah,
I didn't know.

2269
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:50,330
Charismatic megaphone is great and I
think that there's some things are so

2270
01:45:50,331 --> 01:45:55,331
charismatic wolves and grizzlies that
like New Jersey cat ladies know about

2271
01:45:57,411 --> 01:45:58,610
them.
Did you see that?

2272
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:01,730
The,
the billboard that they were all cecil,

2273
01:46:02,330 --> 01:46:07,310
there was a lion hugging a bear that was
trying to stop the bear hunt in New

2274
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:07,730
Jersey.
No,

2275
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:10,050
he never saw it.
I know that you don't even guy someone,

2276
01:46:10,051 --> 01:46:10,731
you know,
the pedals,

2277
01:46:10,731 --> 01:46:13,520
the bear as Sherman's shot pedals.
How rude.

2278
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:17,630
Like whenever something like that
happens.

2279
01:46:17,631 --> 01:46:18,464
Man,
I remember reading it.

2280
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:21,410
I read it right when I,
right when it came out like a fish and

2281
01:46:21,411 --> 01:46:23,780
game agency.
They're just a little background is a

2282
01:46:23,781 --> 01:46:26,930
bear.
Is there kind of a neighborhood bear in

2283
01:46:26,931 --> 01:46:30,050
New Jersey?
And he had had some kind of injury or

2284
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:35,340
uh,
possibly birth defect where he wasn't

2285
01:46:36,591 --> 01:46:39,470
able to.
He spent a lot of time walking bipedaly

2286
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:40,810
yeah.
Um,

2287
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:44,070
which is not uncommon,
which is probably when he had his,

2288
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:47,450
he had obvious injuries in his front
section.

2289
01:46:47,451 --> 01:46:48,800
So would,
would walk.

2290
01:46:48,801 --> 01:46:49,251
Yeah.
Debbie,

2291
01:46:49,251 --> 01:46:50,490
not uncommon and probably,

2292
01:46:50,490 --> 01:46:53,010
you know,
it could be a lot of the things we have

2293
01:46:53,011 --> 01:46:53,841
about harming,
you know,

2294
01:46:53,841 --> 01:46:54,900
like,
like large,

2295
01:46:54,901 --> 01:46:56,730
mysterious and it's could come from,
you know,

2296
01:46:56,731 --> 01:46:58,290
obviously bears walking around their
back feet.

2297
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:00,900
But you know,
New Jersey had their.

2298
01:47:00,901 --> 01:47:04,650
Have they haven't,
I don't want to say I don't want to have

2299
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:08,730
this mean too many,
but they have a exploding population of

2300
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:10,590
black.
I'm always reluctant to say something's

2301
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:13,630
overpopulated because you always got to
ask like according to whose definition

2302
01:47:14,110 --> 01:47:16,010
is it,
like the automobile insurance comp

2303
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:18,540
industry,
because they'll say everything's over

2304
01:47:18,541 --> 01:47:20,520
populated that you might run over with
your car.

2305
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:23,550
Agricultural interests have a different
definition of overpopulated,

2306
01:47:23,551 --> 01:47:26,340
so they have a shitload of bears.
That's a fair statement.

2307
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:29,670
They had a hunting season.
Turns out some guy comes into a check

2308
01:47:29,671 --> 01:47:33,690
station and he had shot this bear that
walks around on his back feet and they'd

2309
01:47:33,691 --> 01:47:37,770
given him the name pedals because he'd
taken two scavenging bird feeders and

2310
01:47:37,771 --> 01:47:38,700
stuff around the neighborhood.

2311
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:40,890
And um,
so I can't remember the magazine,

2312
01:47:40,891 --> 01:47:44,010
one of those,
one of those dip shitty a New York

2313
01:47:44,011 --> 01:47:48,780
online magazines and just basically
coles basically steals shit out of the

2314
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:50,850
New York Times and writes its own
interpretations of New York Times

2315
01:47:50,851 --> 01:47:53,790
articles.
Wasn't Gawk or something like that.

2316
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:55,860
Said that pedals had been assassinated?
Yes.

2317
01:47:57,640 --> 01:48:00,200
Oh,
I read that.

2318
01:48:00,201 --> 01:48:04,080
But what are those websites that all
they do is like hack on traditional

2319
01:48:04,081 --> 01:48:06,330
media,
but then they just write articles

2320
01:48:06,331 --> 01:48:08,700
commenting on traditional media stories.
Yeah,

2321
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:13,790
but they're not generating leads.
Let's look at this billboard ban the

2322
01:48:13,801 --> 01:48:15,780
bear hunt.
Bear all seesaw.

2323
01:48:15,781 --> 01:48:17,040
They're crying,
they're crying,

2324
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:21,150
they have cartoon tears like literal and
look how the bears hugging or the line

2325
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:24,030
rather is hugging the bear.
Poor babies.

2326
01:48:24,330 --> 01:48:25,590
Yeah.
That's a nice billboard.

2327
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,340
Um,
what,

2328
01:48:28,050 --> 01:48:29,640
what about pedals?
Oh,

2329
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:34,790
the people that get the charismatic
megafauna because another that we talked

2330
01:48:35,071 --> 01:48:36,090
about,
our podcast recently,

2331
01:48:36,091 --> 01:48:38,150
we had a biologist on,
um,

2332
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:40,550
who works for the Kalispell tribe,
you know,

2333
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:46,850
Indian tribe and that historically you
were in Idaho portions of Washington and

2334
01:48:48,781 --> 01:48:49,770
portions of Montana.

2335
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:52,560
Um,
and they're very involved and Caribou

2336
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:56,550
Mountain Caribou recovery in the US.
So most people do not know that.

2337
01:48:57,270 --> 01:48:58,320
Um,
traditional,

2338
01:48:58,910 --> 01:49:01,950
traditional.
We had a Caribou population that drifted

2339
01:49:01,951 --> 01:49:06,300
down from,
drifted from Canada down into northern

2340
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,340
Washington,
northern Idaho,

2341
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:11,190
northwest Montana.
We don't have that now at all.

2342
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:12,360
Well,
it was about a dozen of them.

2343
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:15,120
Okay.
Right at this moment that we're talking

2344
01:49:15,121 --> 01:49:17,370
right now,
there are some,

2345
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:21,330
a couple miles from the US border inside
Canada,

2346
01:49:21,990 --> 01:49:26,980
but there used to be the last legal one
to be killed wasn't.

2347
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:30,450
It was back in the 19 twenties.
What happened in was just disturbances

2348
01:49:30,451 --> 01:49:32,360
that habitat,
um,

2349
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,800
uh,
there was always a small,

2350
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:38,610
not a large number of them and we had a
lot of things that mess with their

2351
01:49:38,611 --> 01:49:40,890
travel corridors,
development road,

2352
01:49:40,891 --> 01:49:44,240
construction,
logging activities and now they,

2353
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:49,030
they rarely ever drift down into the US,
but as an active recovery area there.

2354
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:54,060
So we got about a dozen Caribou that are
contenders to be in theU ,

2355
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:59,200
s net sometimes we'll actually crossed
and come into the US in the selkirk

2356
01:49:59,201 --> 01:50:02,680
mountains.
No one gives a shit

2357
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,900
about mountain Caribou.

2358
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:12,210
The amount of like energy,
the amount of mental energy that goes

2359
01:50:12,211 --> 01:50:17,211
into people's favorite animals
at the expense of other good projects.

2360
01:50:20,801 --> 01:50:23,410
We could be other good wildlife projects
we could be working on.

2361
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:27,580
Kind of boggles my mind.
Black bears you have.

2362
01:50:27,610 --> 01:50:31,120
So we have enough black bears that we
have black bear hunting seasons and I

2363
01:50:31,121 --> 01:50:32,530
think 36 states.

2364
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:34,463
Wow.

2365
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:39,630
Rapidly expanding population of black
bears and people will spend enormous

2366
01:50:39,631 --> 01:50:44,631
amounts of energy and resources because
it's like I don't understand it and

2367
01:50:45,121 --> 01:50:47,550
they're just.
And they just like are willfully

2368
01:50:47,551 --> 01:50:51,450
ignorant about other wildlife issues
that are much more important because

2369
01:50:51,451 --> 01:50:52,770
it's like,
it's not cuddly.

2370
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:54,750
It doesn't look fuzzy.
Well,

2371
01:50:54,751 --> 01:50:57,420
they don't have a stuffed one.
I don't know what it is.

2372
01:50:57,450 --> 01:50:59,520
Stuffed Teddy bears.
There's a lot of it.

2373
01:50:59,990 --> 01:51:00,823
The what

2374
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:02,980
we,
we've gotten accustomed to thinking of

2375
01:51:02,981 --> 01:51:05,410
these things is our friends.
It's Yogi bear.

2376
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:08,890
We,
we've done these anthropomorphization

2377
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:13,600
with these cartoons and television shows
and it's ingrained in the consciousness

2378
01:51:13,601 --> 01:51:15,280
of a lot of people.
No matter what you do,

2379
01:51:15,281 --> 01:51:16,620
you can't get it out of there.
There's,

2380
01:51:16,860 --> 01:51:19,960
there's some legitimate differences
between animals.

2381
01:51:19,961 --> 01:51:21,580
You know,
we were talking about that yesterday.

2382
01:51:21,770 --> 01:51:25,210
We were talking about the differences
between bears and deer.

2383
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:27,320
Like deer looks at you in a bear,
looks at you.

2384
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:31,300
You know about how when I was talking
before the show about whitetail deer,

2385
01:51:31,301 --> 01:51:33,100
it's like catching the other day.
You in a way,

2386
01:51:33,101 --> 01:51:34,500
nothing has ever looked at.
Look at you.

2387
01:51:34,540 --> 01:51:36,550
That's their electric.
Their eyes are like,

2388
01:51:36,570 --> 01:51:37,391
they like,
no,

2389
01:51:37,391 --> 01:51:38,590
you're there to kill them.
And they're like,

2390
01:51:38,591 --> 01:51:39,940
oh,
that's fucking person.

2391
01:51:39,941 --> 01:51:44,020
I've got to get out of hand.
Or a bear looks at you like going on

2392
01:51:44,021 --> 01:51:45,310
here,
can I eat you?

2393
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:47,850
Can you eat me?
You know,

2394
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:51,160
there's like a weird sort of
relationship that people have with

2395
01:51:51,161 --> 01:51:53,240
bears.
Like they look at you and.

2396
01:51:53,350 --> 01:51:56,980
But they don't look at you with the same
sort of intense fear that a game animal

2397
01:51:56,981 --> 01:51:57,814
looks at you.
Yeah.

2398
01:51:57,980 --> 01:52:02,980
There's this blurring of the lines there
and I think that when we think of

2399
01:52:03,941 --> 01:52:07,390
animals that we eat,
we have very distinct classifications.

2400
01:52:07,391 --> 01:52:08,740
You tell people you eat bear.
They go,

2401
01:52:08,741 --> 01:52:10,510
Oh God.
And I did,

2402
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:14,050
you know when the first hunts that you
tried to take me on was black bear hunt?

2403
01:52:14,051 --> 01:52:14,681
And I was like,
man,

2404
01:52:14,681 --> 01:52:16,690
I don't want to go.
It took some getting used to.

2405
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:18,010
Yeah.
Now I'm like,

2406
01:52:18,011 --> 01:52:21,260
when we go on,
let's go get some blueberry bears.

2407
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:22,870
Yeah,
I have.

2408
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:24,331
I,
you know,

2409
01:52:24,331 --> 01:52:25,930
I have the same.
I had the same problem.

2410
01:52:25,931 --> 01:52:30,720
Why do I do create a hierarchy?
But I also try to like question where

2411
01:52:30,721 --> 01:52:33,000
the hierarchy has come from.
It comes from.

2412
01:52:33,001 --> 01:52:38,001
And to suss out contradiction,
but the only problem to me where it gets

2413
01:52:38,161 --> 01:52:43,110
problematic for me is the way that in
which it seems that you can get some

2414
01:52:43,111 --> 01:52:45,060
American,
so excited about

2415
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:52,030
preventing any kind of exploitation of a
handful of species,

2416
01:52:52,450 --> 01:52:55,510
yet there,
yet they remain completely uninvolved

2417
01:52:56,530 --> 01:52:57,490
with the,

2418
01:52:58,910 --> 01:53:02,510
with the the issues and politics and
recovery efforts of other things that

2419
01:53:02,590 --> 01:53:05,120
needed really that need it right now.
Yeah.

2420
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:09,290
You know the fact that with wolves and
grid like certain populations of grizzly

2421
01:53:09,291 --> 01:53:12,200
bears,
certain populations of wolves have

2422
01:53:12,201 --> 01:53:15,140
reached recovery objective.
Yet we still cover them on the

2423
01:53:15,141 --> 01:53:18,590
endangered species act because people
are wanting to use the endangered

2424
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:22,400
species act to save things from any
threat of exploitation at all,

2425
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:25,010
like nothing to do with what?
Nothing to do with what the legislation

2426
01:53:25,011 --> 01:53:26,450
was meant for.
It's become.

2427
01:53:26,730 --> 01:53:31,190
It's become the favorite animal act,
and if you want to initiate something

2428
01:53:31,191 --> 01:53:34,760
called the favor animal act and try to
get it passed by Congress,

2429
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:39,880
feel free,
but don't steal the ESA and take it away

2430
01:53:40,431 --> 01:53:45,110
from its intended purpose.
In order to protect your stuffed animal

2431
01:53:45,111 --> 01:53:45,340
animal

2432
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:48,130
sales,
you had a very important point on one of

2433
01:53:48,131 --> 01:53:50,830
your podcast where you're talking about
population numbers,

2434
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:53,710
population objectives,
and you were saying that will like if

2435
01:53:53,711 --> 01:53:56,470
you look at a elk,
for example,

2436
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:00,890
in some places elk are extremely common.
You know,

2437
01:54:00,970 --> 01:54:03,700
in Colorado for instance,
there's more elk in Colorado that I

2438
01:54:03,701 --> 01:54:05,160
think any other state,
but yeah.

2439
01:54:05,230 --> 01:54:07,210
Bye Bye.
I think of almost like a factor too.

2440
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:09,670
There's a lot.
So if you tell people in Colorado that

2441
01:54:09,671 --> 01:54:10,660
elk are in danger,
they're like,

2442
01:54:10,661 --> 01:54:12,880
what the fuck are you talking about?
Go to Florida.

2443
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:15,850
There's no elk and elk are gone.
Wolves,

2444
01:54:15,910 --> 01:54:16,690
same thing,
right?

2445
01:54:16,690 --> 01:54:19,690
Elk are gone from 90 percent of their
historic range in the US.

2446
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,100
Wow.
Ninety percent.

2447
01:54:21,670 --> 01:54:24,910
Yet no one has a problem with elk
hunting seasons,

2448
01:54:25,630 --> 01:54:26,890
right,
exactly.

2449
01:54:27,310 --> 01:54:28,780
But them,
that's the thing.

2450
01:54:28,850 --> 01:54:30,400
Who is eating wolves?
Well,

2451
01:54:30,730 --> 01:54:32,550
that's the problem.
And Wolf Dog.

2452
01:54:32,610 --> 01:54:35,490
No,
I don't think it's an arctic explorer as

2453
01:54:35,491 --> 01:54:37,810
his favorite wild meat.
What's loved?

2454
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:39,130
Oh,
he's a psycho dude.

2455
01:54:39,131 --> 01:54:40,780
You know,
he ate two carpaccio.

2456
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:43,800
He ate a,
they found a.

2457
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:46,860
Oh,
a desiccated

2458
01:54:48,390 --> 01:54:52,480
whale beached.
And it had been like in the,

2459
01:54:52,690 --> 01:54:57,690
in the salt and its tongue was dried out
and he cut the tongue out and he said

2460
01:54:58,471 --> 01:55:00,270
the how.
They boiled repeatedly,

2461
01:55:00,271 --> 01:55:02,430
repeatedly tried to get the salt out and
eventually ate it.

2462
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:05,430
And then he ran into some eskimo hunters
who said that thing been laying there

2463
01:55:05,431 --> 01:55:06,264
for three years.

2464
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:10,990
Jesus Christ.
What?

2465
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:13,610
He was hardcore.
How the fuck did he eat in three year

2466
01:55:13,611 --> 01:55:14,444
old tongue.

2467
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:16,440
Like you said,
you just kept boiling it and rebounded.

2468
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:18,890
Do it hit anyone.
Like if you want to do,

2469
01:55:18,930 --> 01:55:20,540
he can't have that some bitch on your
podcast.

2470
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:24,170
He made Stevinson.
He's got a book my life with the Eskimo.

2471
01:55:24,350 --> 01:55:28,970
So he made first contact with a lot of
people in the High Arctic.

2472
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:34,840
They knew he was meeting people who knew
about whites but hadn't met and yet.

2473
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:37,340
Wow.
And what was funny about this dude is

2474
01:55:37,341 --> 01:55:42,170
how frustrated he would get with a
trying to show him his shit,

2475
01:55:42,171 --> 01:55:43,860
which he thought they'd be blown away
by.

2476
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:48,360
So He'd let get out a gun or one day,
he's one days.

2477
01:55:48,361 --> 01:55:49,980
Explain to people that we can do.
He's like,

2478
01:55:49,981 --> 01:55:50,521
my people,
you know,

2479
01:55:50,521 --> 01:55:51,990
we can do surgery.
What year was this?

2480
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:55,580
He was making first contact and the
early 19 hundreds of Blake,

2481
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:59,610
like coronation goal Victoria island up
open the Canadian High Arctic again.

2482
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:03,210
They knew,
they knew that there was whites.

2483
01:56:03,211 --> 01:56:06,360
They hadn't met any whites yet and he'd
come to them and um,

2484
01:56:06,810 --> 01:56:08,370
he'd expect blown way.
Like he,

2485
01:56:08,371 --> 01:56:13,080
he shows some guys his firearm has gone
and this dude's like,

2486
01:56:13,081 --> 01:56:14,370
yeah,
that's cool.

2487
01:56:14,730 --> 01:56:19,730
But I know a guy that can shoot his bow
and his error will travel to the far

2488
01:56:21,031 --> 01:56:23,640
side of the mountain and kill a care
with the,

2489
01:56:23,641 --> 01:56:27,750
you can't even see.
Or he was saying we can do surgery on

2490
01:56:27,751 --> 01:56:30,450
people do an appendectomy.
And he says,

2491
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:36,320
I know a guy that can take your whole
spine and skull and brain out and put it

2492
01:56:37,381 --> 01:56:41,700
back in again.
He was talking about telescopes and he's

2493
01:56:41,701 --> 01:56:43,920
like,
you can see the moon craters.

2494
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:46,140
And they're like,
I know guys been to the moon

2495
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:52,910
in haunted there.
So that's one upmanship dude.

2496
01:56:53,911 --> 01:56:55,680
It's like,
it's the greatest book man.

2497
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:58,830
How frustrated he gets from one of the
cool things he describes as a,

2498
01:56:59,430 --> 01:57:02,550
he describes how they would kill,
you know,

2499
01:57:02,551 --> 01:57:07,551
when they killed a polar bear,
they would bring the head back and put

2500
01:57:07,591 --> 01:57:10,360
in their lodge,
sort of like,

2501
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:13,140
I don't want to draw it,
like I don't want to push this too far,

2502
01:57:13,141 --> 01:57:16,380
but much in the same way you might bring
a head home and hanging on your wall.

2503
01:57:16,410 --> 01:57:19,230
They would bring it home and put in
their lodge and the thinking has

2504
01:57:19,231 --> 01:57:24,231
explained to staff and some was that um,
I'm bringing him home so that he can

2505
01:57:24,361 --> 01:57:29,361
observe me and my family
and see that we're good people.

2506
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:36,650
And when he goes to the afterlife he
will tell other bears if you got to get

2507
01:57:36,811 --> 01:57:39,840
killed by somebody,
not a bad guy to have it happen.

2508
01:57:41,010 --> 01:57:41,843
That guys.
Okay.

2509
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:46,560
And I often point out about the,
the animal skulls and hides in my own

2510
01:57:46,561 --> 01:57:47,810
home that I feel like,
you know,

2511
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:50,530
I don't want to make myself seem to
spirits will in some ways I,

2512
01:57:50,531 --> 01:57:54,900
I think of that.
I think of that with the animals.

2513
01:57:54,901 --> 01:57:57,780
I haven't in my.
Just a concept that you run in your

2514
01:57:57,781 --> 01:57:58,560
mind,
eh,

2515
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:00,090
that I run in my mind.
I think about him.

2516
01:58:00,220 --> 01:58:01,140
Why was I talking about step?
Oh,

2517
01:58:01,141 --> 01:58:04,110
loved wolf.
So he ate every damn thing like Muskox,

2518
01:58:04,111 --> 01:58:05,790
Caribou,
walrus.

2519
01:58:05,791 --> 01:58:08,430
He ate everything.
And in talks repeatedly about his

2520
01:58:08,431 --> 01:58:11,370
preference for wolf meet preference.
Above all,

2521
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:13,110
I'm telling you,
you read my life with the Eskimo.

2522
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:14,250
Well,
you ate a coyote.

2523
01:58:14,310 --> 01:58:15,690
Yeah.
What was that like?

2524
01:58:15,691 --> 01:58:16,524
Didn't like it.

2525
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:21,570
But here's the problem that I've run
into because I in,

2526
01:58:21,580 --> 01:58:25,380
in Vietnam,
I a fair bit of domestic dog.

2527
01:58:25,381 --> 01:58:30,381
I Caio and I know monkey red howler
monkey.

2528
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:35,040
Those are my big,
my big transgressions of me.

2529
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:36,120
You know,
we all,

2530
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:37,920
like I said,
I admitted earlier to having my own

2531
01:58:37,921 --> 01:58:41,160
animal hierarchies and those were the
times when I've sort of strayed

2532
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:46,560
uncomfortable ground for myself.
I'm canines and hominids or they hominid

2533
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:48,480
no,
not a harm in primate primate.

2534
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:50,670
So,
um,

2535
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:53,430
yeah,
I,

2536
01:58:53,431 --> 01:58:54,910
I get like a,
a,

2537
01:58:54,970 --> 01:58:56,590
I get where I can't really tell what it
tastes like.

2538
01:58:57,040 --> 01:59:00,230
It's difficult to tell what it actually
taste like because you're feeling that

2539
01:59:00,231 --> 01:59:03,340
there's so many other things going on,
emotions,

2540
01:59:03,370 --> 01:59:06,280
thoughts,
contributions and and I get like a hot,

2541
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:09,450
a hot guilty feeling,
Woo.

2542
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:14,610
But when I was in Vietnam,
they described dog as a hot food and I

2543
01:59:15,971 --> 01:59:18,400
kept asking him what that meant because
I didn't really understand but it does

2544
01:59:18,401 --> 01:59:19,660
it like makes me sweaty.

2545
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:22,700
I thought it was like a guilt thing,
but people would,

2546
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:26,410
they would eat it and serve it around
the holidays.

2547
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:29,620
So the lunar new year,
it was auspicious.

2548
01:59:29,621 --> 01:59:34,030
Suspicious.
It's auspicious to eat dog meat in the

2549
01:59:34,030 --> 01:59:37,030
days leading up to the lunar new year
and it's a game.

2550
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:41,950
It's a food that you have.
It's like a risky enterprise and summer.

2551
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:47,040
Vietnam is kind of a risky enterprise to
eat deer and it'd be like a dog.

2552
01:59:48,010 --> 01:59:49,420
Yeah.
I'm sorry to eat dog.

2553
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:52,360
And it's like some of the people like
these restaurants open up that are only

2554
01:59:52,361 --> 01:59:56,560
open that time of year and there's
people coming in to like bring in good

2555
01:59:56,561 --> 01:59:57,970
luck,
risky enterprise.

2556
01:59:57,971 --> 02:00:02,971
How so a guy told me that.
One of the guys I interviewed told me

2557
02:00:04,781 --> 02:00:09,781
that he was unable to get his,
he's unable to have children and they

2558
02:00:10,001 --> 02:00:11,710
determined that it was.
It was on him.

2559
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:13,360
His wife was fertile,
he was infertile.

2560
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:16,360
He ate dog

2561
02:00:18,180 --> 02:00:21,510
and it changed.
His fortunes have changed his luck and

2562
02:00:21,511 --> 02:00:25,170
he got his wife pregnant.
Now he says,

2563
02:00:25,171 --> 02:00:30,171
I will not eat dog again for fear that I
would undo what I did.

2564
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:34,980
It's a powerful food.
This is a sentiment held more in the

2565
02:00:34,981 --> 02:00:39,810
north than in the held more like I spent
time in Hanoi and I spent time in Saigon

2566
02:00:39,811 --> 02:00:42,570
or Ho Chi Minh City as the sentiment
that was expressed,

2567
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:47,600
more like in more of a semi spiritual
way in the north than it was in the

2568
02:00:49,261 --> 02:00:49,981
south.
Now,

2569
02:00:49,981 --> 02:00:54,130
a translator that I had hired a told me
I don't eat dark.

2570
02:00:55,450 --> 02:00:57,820
Uh,
he said,

2571
02:00:57,830 --> 02:00:59,220
I don't eat dogs.
I have a dark.

2572
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:06,030
I went to his house to see his dog.
I come in and the dog is in a small cage

2573
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:10,540
probably.
I'm not exaggerating.

2574
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:11,220
I say it was,
yeah,

2575
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:14,380
I mean it was probably maybe two feet by
three and a half feet

2576
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:20,590
and it's a wire mesh cage and there's a,
like a drip pan below it basically to

2577
02:01:20,591 --> 02:01:25,591
collect the animal's waste and,
and there's a bowl of rice in the dog,

2578
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:30,790
just goes ape shit and when,
when we come in and it just like looking

2579
02:01:30,791 --> 02:01:32,200
at the dog,
it just was not,

2580
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:34,510
it just did not seem like a well dog.
Okay.

2581
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:37,080
I said to him,
uh,

2582
02:01:37,630 --> 02:01:40,160
and he lives like a very busy in Hanoi,

2583
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:44,150
like you walk out and it's just the full
Vietnam may him scooters.

2584
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:46,490
It's just like insane.
And I said to him,

2585
02:01:46,850 --> 02:01:49,700
so you just take them out,
like you can just go walk them

2586
02:01:50,790 --> 02:01:51,623
here.

2587
02:01:52,150 --> 02:01:54,160
And he kind of looks at me like he
doesn't understand when talking about.

2588
02:01:55,110 --> 02:01:59,860
And it turns out that that dog hadn't
been out of that cage since he brought

2589
02:01:59,861 --> 02:02:03,190
it home.
That was his pet dog,

2590
02:02:03,191 --> 02:02:05,920
which he kept like a parakeet Jesus
Christ.

2591
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:09,130
He said I wouldn't eat.
Now conversely,

2592
02:02:10,860 --> 02:02:14,790
in the training,
I went out to a farm.

2593
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:17,400
There were a guy has a small plot of
land,

2594
02:02:17,450 --> 02:02:19,620
he's there,
they have like a,

2595
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:23,790
basically there's was system there,
the you have very poor farmers who don't

2596
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:25,530
own the land,
but it's state owned land,

2597
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:28,860
government own land,
but they have subsistence farms and this

2598
02:02:28,861 --> 02:02:32,670
guy raised a sugar cane.
He had an air gun,

2599
02:02:32,671 --> 02:02:35,220
you can't have a regular gun,
but he had an air gun and he would hunt

2600
02:02:35,221 --> 02:02:36,150
various,
uh,

2601
02:02:36,270 --> 02:02:40,740
arboreal marsupial's and,
and things to eat and he had some water

2602
02:02:40,741 --> 02:02:45,030
river flowing through his place and he
had a small amount of livestock and

2603
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:48,120
raise some crops and peppers and various
things and he had a bunch of dogs

2604
02:02:48,121 --> 02:02:50,940
running around on his place,
just pet dogs.

2605
02:02:51,510 --> 02:02:56,510
He was explaining to me that now and
then when the dogs are bred up to a

2606
02:02:57,511 --> 02:03:02,511
number that's hard to support them,
the dog buyer comes and the dog buyer

2607
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:07,200
will give you some cash for your excess
dog population.

2608
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:12,560
And those are the dogs that go into the
markets of Vietnam.

2609
02:03:14,250 --> 02:03:17,250
Other countries actually have places
where they're like breeding and rearing

2610
02:03:17,251 --> 02:03:19,740
dogs for slaughter.
But that was the Vietnamese system.

2611
02:03:21,150 --> 02:03:25,020
So it might've been,
I have many interesting things about

2612
02:03:25,021 --> 02:03:29,970
this whole thing is about being like
comparing like this guy's pet to this

2613
02:03:29,971 --> 02:03:32,760
guy's livestock.
You sort of got into this thing as which

2614
02:03:32,761 --> 02:03:36,150
is the more enviable position,
which is more enviable position

2615
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:39,310
livestock.
I'll take that life over.

2616
02:03:39,311 --> 02:03:41,910
Then living in the cage,
shitting onto like a great.

2617
02:03:42,330 --> 02:03:47,330
And I went to visit a guy that actually
a wholesaler who buys the dogs from

2618
02:03:49,921 --> 02:03:54,330
farmers on the countryside and he comes
back and they fatten.

2619
02:03:54,390 --> 02:03:57,840
They would fatten the dogs on beef,
stomach beef trim.

2620
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:01,370
Basically the stuff that in the US we
send a rendering plants.

2621
02:04:01,371 --> 02:04:01,901
Like,
like when,

2622
02:04:01,901 --> 02:04:03,510
when when they slaughter cat,
almost everything,

2623
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:05,160
you know,
once the meats gone,

2624
02:04:05,161 --> 02:04:06,330
everything goes to a rendering plant.

2625
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:10,050
He would buy basically what us
production facility send to a rendering

2626
02:04:10,051 --> 02:04:11,550
plant and that's what he would fatten
dog on.

2627
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:17,100
And you'd go to the markets and they'd
have dogs stack like just dog part

2628
02:04:17,101 --> 02:04:20,730
stacked up pyramids at the market.
It was bizarre to see man,

2629
02:04:20,731 --> 02:04:25,500
and I'll tell you I'm a,
I went out in different places and with

2630
02:04:25,501 --> 02:04:30,501
different people and different things.
I went out for seven nights in a row and

2631
02:04:30,511 --> 02:04:35,511
I could never get beyond.
I could never get beyond my own biases

2632
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:42,150
about what's food and what's not food.
It was just like very difficult for me

2633
02:04:42,151 --> 02:04:47,151
to,
to eat it and fake my way through and it

2634
02:04:47,351 --> 02:04:49,860
was hard.
So I do understand when people come to

2635
02:04:49,861 --> 02:04:50,820
me and they're looking,
they're like,

2636
02:04:50,821 --> 02:04:51,810
hey man,
a bear,

2637
02:04:52,290 --> 02:04:52,920
like in,
uh,

2638
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:54,260
you know,
I'm 100.

2639
02:04:54,261 --> 02:04:56,820
I've,
I've 100 grade I've hunted and eaten

2640
02:04:56,910 --> 02:04:58,680
hundreds and hundreds of pounds of black
bear meat.

2641
02:04:58,890 --> 02:05:00,960
Um,
when people come in,

2642
02:05:00,961 --> 02:05:01,381
they're like,
dude,

2643
02:05:01,381 --> 02:05:03,800
I just like,
I don't want to act like that.

2644
02:05:03,810 --> 02:05:05,880
They're coming.
When people come to me and express

2645
02:05:05,890 --> 02:05:07,680
disapproval,
right?

2646
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:11,610
I don't want to act like I can't
understand where they're coming from

2647
02:05:11,790 --> 02:05:13,580
because I had the same thing I felt
there.

2648
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:15,330
Right.
I've ever making the argument.

2649
02:05:15,331 --> 02:05:17,450
I never fact checked it,
but I feel it is.

2650
02:05:17,610 --> 02:05:22,610
There are more people in this world who
live in a country where it's socially

2651
02:05:23,671 --> 02:05:25,950
acceptable to eat dog meat.
The not.

2652
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:32,030
I haven't formally fact check that,
but I remember looking at some basic

2653
02:05:32,431 --> 02:05:34,020
figures and thinking that that was true.

2654
02:05:34,540 --> 02:05:35,980
Well,
it's interesting that we choose to not

2655
02:05:35,981 --> 02:05:39,310
eat pigs,
but pigs are probably as intelligent if

2656
02:05:39,311 --> 02:05:41,590
not more to choose to eat pigs rather.
Yeah.

2657
02:05:41,860 --> 02:05:45,190
Probably as intelligent or more than
dogs.

2658
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:49,120
Yeah,
and dogs are probably more dangerous

2659
02:05:49,121 --> 02:05:51,330
when they're feral than pigs are.
Yeah.

2660
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:53,950
When pigs are feral,
they generally avoid people.

2661
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:56,710
When dogs are feral,
they known always.

2662
02:05:56,711 --> 02:06:00,310
I mean there was an instance a couple
years ago outside of Atlanta were an

2663
02:06:00,490 --> 02:06:04,510
elderly couple was attacked and someone
was killed by wild dogs.

2664
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:06,920
Yeah.
The Australian Dingo traces back to

2665
02:06:06,921 --> 02:06:11,540
being a is a,
is a dog who knows it's ancestry to,

2666
02:06:11,700 --> 02:06:14,450
to human activities.
So that's it really.

2667
02:06:14,530 --> 02:06:16,390
So it used to be a domesticated animal.
It was,

2668
02:06:16,391 --> 02:06:18,070
yeah.
It was a very early form.

2669
02:06:18,190 --> 02:06:20,590
Wow.
Check that out.

2670
02:06:20,591 --> 02:06:21,890
Make sure I'm right about that.
What the,

2671
02:06:21,940 --> 02:06:23,740
what the genetic history that Dingo is.

2672
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:25,420
What's their wild dog called?

2673
02:06:26,310 --> 02:06:27,110
Dingo.
Dingo.

2674
02:06:27,110 --> 02:06:28,470
Yeah.
Yeah,

2675
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:30,510
yeah.
I think it's some kind of a.

2676
02:06:30,511 --> 02:06:34,110
it's like a dog breed.
Probably Find Adam Green tree holding

2677
02:06:34,111 --> 02:06:35,440
one up by his ankles to the fucking

2678
02:06:36,810 --> 02:06:37,670
bowl

2679
02:06:38,970 --> 02:06:40,550
arrow hole.
And it's a wild dog.

2680
02:06:40,970 --> 02:06:43,720
Says wild but lupus.
But what's,

2681
02:06:43,770 --> 02:06:45,560
uh,
what's his ancestry?

2682
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:51,550
Just uh,
just google dingoes were once domestic

2683
02:06:51,551 --> 02:06:55,590
dogs.
Dingo domesticated animal.

2684
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:02,310
I'm looking at the genetic status origin
here.

2685
02:07:02,311 --> 02:07:06,180
I'll just pull it up so you can see
Indian wolf and Arabian Wolf evolved

2686
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:07,033
from.

2687
02:07:07,180 --> 02:07:08,870
Hmm.
Here.

2688
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:11,180
Mad.
Don't feel like I'm wrong.

2689
02:07:13,770 --> 02:07:14,840
Hm.
Interesting.

2690
02:07:14,900 --> 02:07:19,280
Widely held.
The dingoes have evolved from the Indian

2691
02:07:19,281 --> 02:07:19,791
Wolf.
Yeah,

2692
02:07:19,791 --> 02:07:21,230
right there.
6,000,

2693
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:25,910
10,000 years ago.
Bread from a was assumed for all

2694
02:07:25,911 --> 02:07:29,100
domestic dogs.
The theory was based on the

2695
02:07:29,420 --> 02:07:34,420
morphological similarities of the Dingo
skulls and the skulls of the subspecies

2696
02:07:34,670 --> 02:07:38,050
of wolves.
Genetic analysis indicated that a much

2697
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:40,060
earlier domestication.
Huh?

2698
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:42,190
Oh.
So there is a domestication.

2699
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:44,770
New study suggests dingoes may have in
the south China.

2700
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:47,470
Okay.
So you have humans.

2701
02:07:47,740 --> 02:07:49,660
Interesting.
So they were originally domesticated and

2702
02:07:49,661 --> 02:07:51,510
then cut loose.
Yeah,

2703
02:07:51,730 --> 02:07:52,421
we,
I mean,

2704
02:07:52,421 --> 02:07:53,720
I,
I've told you,

2705
02:07:53,721 --> 02:07:57,190
I mean I have my own.
I had my own thing about bear and then I

2706
02:07:57,310 --> 02:07:59,980
hunted bear and eight bear.
And then that thing went away.

2707
02:08:00,050 --> 02:08:01,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

2708
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:04,450
It's just been this what it is,
but it still doesn't seem the same to me

2709
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:06,640
as like a deer.
Like if you,

2710
02:08:06,670 --> 02:08:07,780
if you gave me a choice,
hey,

2711
02:08:07,781 --> 02:08:09,430
would you rather go hon?
Axis deer,

2712
02:08:09,431 --> 02:08:12,670
which I've never hunted seems so much
more natural to me.

2713
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:13,750
Think go hunt black bear.

2714
02:08:14,610 --> 02:08:16,530
Yeah.
I know.

2715
02:08:16,590 --> 02:08:20,880
I have such a complicated,
a complicated sets of feelings about

2716
02:08:21,690 --> 02:08:25,830
black bears.
And as a hunter strange,

2717
02:08:25,831 --> 02:08:30,831
I've gotten to the thing where I'm
maybe before I even say I'm going to say

2718
02:08:31,221 --> 02:08:36,221
why it's not quite strange.
I have found that a lot of big game

2719
02:08:36,351 --> 02:08:37,184
hunters

2720
02:08:37,810 --> 02:08:38,643
will

2721
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:44,500
do some amount of bear hunting,
get a couple of bears and then drift

2722
02:08:45,291 --> 02:08:49,740
away from bear hunting.
Um,

2723
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:53,620
they still respect how difficult it is
and how much you can learn about

2724
02:08:53,621 --> 02:08:58,240
barriers by fine at blop you have gotten
some bears are always excited to go on a

2725
02:08:58,241 --> 02:09:00,430
bear hunt if it's someone's first

2726
02:09:01,770 --> 02:09:02,603
bear hunt,

2727
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:04,581
like to like,
you know,

2728
02:09:04,581 --> 02:09:07,670
I have no desire if you want to go,
I would love to go along.

2729
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:11,420
But it's something to happen.
But whereas like something like elk,

2730
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:15,380
the more you get and the more you eat,
the more you want to get in,

2731
02:09:15,381 --> 02:09:16,214
the more you want to eat.

2732
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:17,250
Right.
But you don't,

2733
02:09:17,251 --> 02:09:20,160
you think that's a public pressure thing
though in a lot of ways about bears

2734
02:09:20,430 --> 02:09:23,160
because I,
I've described even to my friends about

2735
02:09:23,161 --> 02:09:26,310
hunting bear and that just put their
head back like they're fine with me

2736
02:09:26,311 --> 02:09:27,420
hunting deer.
They're fine with me.

2737
02:09:27,421 --> 02:09:29,370
Hunting pigs.
Everybody seems to be in supportive

2738
02:09:29,371 --> 02:09:30,260
hunting pigs.
Yeah.

2739
02:09:30,870 --> 02:09:31,590
You know how my brother,
you know,

2740
02:09:31,590 --> 02:09:36,590
my brother put the bear thing is.
Here's the conundrum for him and it's

2741
02:09:36,631 --> 02:09:39,330
pretty simple.
I'm a bear.

2742
02:09:39,331 --> 02:09:42,360
Has a very beautiful,
very usable hide.

2743
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:45,780
Okay.
So you know like deer hides.

2744
02:09:46,230 --> 02:09:48,270
You can,
you can throw it through a process,

2745
02:09:48,271 --> 02:09:52,170
you can get like a buck skin from it.
You can get some deer hides,

2746
02:09:52,171 --> 02:09:55,730
you can get a pretty good usable leather
that,

2747
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:57,900
that the use used to make apparel.
In fact,

2748
02:09:58,110 --> 02:10:00,240
everybody knows Daniel Boone,
right?

2749
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:05,630
Daniel Boone was a much of his life was
spent in the business of trading deer

2750
02:10:05,911 --> 02:10:07,680
hides.
Daniel Boone was a commercial hunter.

2751
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:12,360
He will go out and shoot white tail deer
in the summer when their hides were thin

2752
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:15,090
and sell them,
and it was used for industrial work

2753
02:10:15,091 --> 02:10:20,091
where it was used for work apparel.
Like basically the 17 fifties version of

2754
02:10:21,361 --> 02:10:24,770
carhartt close was made out of deer hide
summer.

2755
02:10:24,780 --> 02:10:26,010
Dear.
I'm not familiar with that term.

2756
02:10:26,011 --> 02:10:27,510
Carhartt.
What does that mean?

2757
02:10:27,630 --> 02:10:30,060
Like carhartt work wear?
Carhartt jackets,

2758
02:10:30,061 --> 02:10:31,440
Carhartt Pants,
Jesus Christ.

2759
02:10:31,441 --> 02:10:32,130
Joe.
No,

2760
02:10:32,130 --> 02:10:32,970
I know.
Dickies.

2761
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:33,820
Yeah,
same thing.

2762
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:34,140
Okay.

2763
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:36,930
I never heard a carhartt.
This same thing with Jamie.

2764
02:10:37,630 --> 02:10:39,320
Like you know,
like work pants.

2765
02:10:39,321 --> 02:10:41,720
He got like a little holster for a
hammer and shut up inside of them.

2766
02:10:41,721 --> 02:10:42,554
Yeah.
Okay.

2767
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:44,570
I'm so used to make them out of
Buckskin.

2768
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:45,711
Yeah.
Like work,

2769
02:10:45,711 --> 02:10:48,020
work apparel and his time was making
bucks again.

2770
02:10:48,290 --> 02:10:50,750
Those things smelled great.
At the end of the day I'll do.

2771
02:10:50,751 --> 02:10:54,710
My Dad had my dad saved a lot of his
deer and had a uh,

2772
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:58,100
an had a sport coat made out of his own
deer and do that thing was amazing and

2773
02:10:58,101 --> 02:10:59,620
smelled good.
Really?

2774
02:10:59,621 --> 02:11:02,390
I'll do as a nicest jacket.
He's dead.

2775
02:11:02,391 --> 02:11:04,280
I should find.
I should go dig around and stuff and

2776
02:11:04,281 --> 02:11:07,460
find that he,
it was dyed black is beautiful coat,

2777
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:09,860
but it hadn't had one mate.
You've shot a lot of deer.

2778
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:12,560
Well that wasn't good at is.
Uh,

2779
02:11:13,070 --> 02:11:14,950
it's like,
yes you can do stuff with,

2780
02:11:14,970 --> 02:11:19,970
but it's not really in today's age of
other fabrics is not practical.

2781
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:25,160
However,
a bear hide has timeless beauty and

2782
02:11:25,161 --> 02:11:27,920
timeless application.
Have you ever thought about making a

2783
02:11:27,921 --> 02:11:30,020
jacket at a bear hide?
Yes.

2784
02:11:30,230 --> 02:11:31,130
Did you ever do it?
Yeah.

2785
02:11:31,180 --> 02:11:32,840
Well no,
because what I was doing for a long time

2786
02:11:32,841 --> 02:11:36,500
was saving up my bear hides and I wanted
to cut them into like nine or 10 inch

2787
02:11:36,501 --> 02:11:40,850
squares and have a very large conflict
are made out of many different bears cut

2788
02:11:40,851 --> 02:11:45,320
into squares stitched.
I haven't given up on that idea,

2789
02:11:45,590 --> 02:11:48,620
but I give a lot of my bear hides away
to people who really liked them anyway.

2790
02:11:48,950 --> 02:11:53,270
When you get a bear,
it's like no one in their right mind

2791
02:11:53,330 --> 02:11:55,010
gets rid of a bear hide.
Right?

2792
02:11:55,700 --> 02:11:58,940
So you get one and you get a Tan and
then you've got to bear hide.

2793
02:11:59,330 --> 02:12:02,030
And once you got to bear hide and it's
like on the floor and then you got bear

2794
02:12:02,031 --> 02:12:04,820
hide over the back of the couch and you
got to bear hide hanging on the wall,

2795
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:07,620
you get to a point where,
um,

2796
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:12,920
you don't need any more bear hides,
you eat the meat and you have the

2797
02:12:12,921 --> 02:12:15,860
highest but you don't need more bear
hides and when you get a bear there's an

2798
02:12:15,861 --> 02:12:20,600
expense to getting the high prepared but
you feel wasteful not using the height.

2799
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:22,850
So it was very hard to shoot a bear just
for me.

2800
02:12:23,150 --> 02:12:25,280
Right,
because you feel like you're wasting

2801
02:12:25,281 --> 02:12:27,320
something that people really want and
it's beautiful.

2802
02:12:27,321 --> 02:12:29,570
And people like to use the,
decorate their homes and use it as a

2803
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:33,750
totem of the wild as opposed to a white
tail deer with very few people do

2804
02:12:33,751 --> 02:12:34,550
anything with the highest.
Yeah.

2805
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:37,640
So now,
like one day Danny was like the last

2806
02:12:37,641 --> 02:12:41,470
bear he got,
he got up to the bear and,

2807
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:45,080
and,
and found himself just kinda.

2808
02:12:45,600 --> 02:12:46,700
He goes,
I just don't,

2809
02:12:47,510 --> 02:12:48,920
I don't need,
you know,

2810
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:52,960
like I look at it and I'm like,
I have like a set of obligations that

2811
02:12:52,961 --> 02:12:57,500
this animal now and uh,
I'm not excited about it anymore.

2812
02:12:57,501 --> 02:13:00,050
I don't want another bear hide.
It's,

2813
02:13:00,051 --> 02:13:01,440
it's an expense.
Then he just,

2814
02:13:01,490 --> 02:13:03,350
he never killed another bear.
Wow.

2815
02:13:03,590 --> 02:13:05,570
He's got some bear hides and he loves,
but he just,

2816
02:13:05,571 --> 02:13:08,390
he just got to where he's got enough
other stuff to eat.

2817
02:13:08,391 --> 02:13:10,490
He's a moose snob.
He killed a moose every year.

2818
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:12,400
Likes the moose meat,
um,

2819
02:13:12,950 --> 02:13:14,030
feeds his family,
moves,

2820
02:13:14,031 --> 02:13:16,070
feeds his family salmon primarily.
Well,

2821
02:13:16,071 --> 02:13:18,140
if he kills a moose every year.
The other problem with that is you're

2822
02:13:18,141 --> 02:13:20,630
talking about like 600 pounds of meat,
right?

2823
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:21,770
Yeah.
He's got a family of four.

2824
02:13:21,771 --> 02:13:24,450
He Burns through it plus let me,
I'll eat.

2825
02:13:24,680 --> 02:13:25,940
Yeah.
So,

2826
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:27,800
but that's just kinda like where he got
in.

2827
02:13:27,801 --> 02:13:29,060
I knew a lot of people,
for whatever reason,

2828
02:13:29,061 --> 02:13:31,770
I used to hunt bears and my other
brother and then he don't.

2829
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,390
He,
he like when he's out at his,

2830
02:13:34,490 --> 02:13:37,110
his,
when he's out at his wife's ranch,

2831
02:13:37,140 --> 02:13:40,200
he'll see bears running around during
bear sees and he doesn't even think

2832
02:13:40,201 --> 02:13:42,300
about going hunting for him and he used
to hunt bears.

2833
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:44,940
What happens?
And you just quit.

2834
02:13:44,970 --> 02:13:48,090
You just quit wanting to hunt bears.
One of my favorite episodes of yours was

2835
02:13:48,091 --> 02:13:52,470
on the Prince of Wales Island where you
had a bear in your site and just

2836
02:13:52,471 --> 02:13:53,910
decided,
I don't want to shoot this bear.

2837
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:56,610
Yeah.
It's just like I,

2838
02:13:56,611 --> 02:13:59,040
I really,
I enjoy watching them.

2839
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:01,010
I enjoy hunting.
I enjoy making smoke.

2840
02:14:01,011 --> 02:14:02,940
Black Bear Hams out,
but it's like,

2841
02:14:02,941 --> 02:14:04,520
uh,
I,

2842
02:14:04,521 --> 02:14:05,250
I,
uh,

2843
02:14:05,250 --> 02:14:06,930
would you ever do that with any other
animal though?

2844
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:09,000
Do what?
Look at it and say,

2845
02:14:09,001 --> 02:14:11,010
I don't want to shoot this.
Like if you saw mature,

2846
02:14:11,130 --> 02:14:14,280
a mature mule deer,
180 inch mule deer.

2847
02:14:14,730 --> 02:14:16,050
No,
no.

2848
02:14:16,110 --> 02:14:17,700
Right,
right.

2849
02:14:18,180 --> 02:14:19,760
But I could picture like with,
with,

2850
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:24,800
you know it,
there's a handful of animals that

2851
02:14:27,860 --> 02:14:30,700
you know what it is you can't.
One of is,

2852
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:35,880
one of the things is this,
I can't help but watch a bear if I'm out

2853
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:40,170
and I glass up a bear,
you know,

2854
02:14:40,171 --> 02:14:42,850
when I say out glass up,
I mean like if I'm sitting on a big

2855
02:14:42,851 --> 02:14:45,090
glass and tin or glass and knob up some
highway,

2856
02:14:45,130 --> 02:14:48,640
have a commanding view of the lands
glassing meaning use your binoculars to

2857
02:14:48,641 --> 02:14:51,460
look at the landscape the way that the
way I generally hunt.

2858
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:56,050
I hunt a lot of open country in the
American west and then Alaska and things

2859
02:14:56,051 --> 02:14:58,420
where you have good visibility.
Um,

2860
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:03,960
the bulk of the time I spent hunting,
I spend on a good lookout point,

2861
02:15:05,140 --> 02:15:07,120
a high point where you can see,
you know,

2862
02:15:07,121 --> 02:15:09,520
a good one,
hundred 80 degree view or maybe not

2863
02:15:09,521 --> 02:15:11,300
always 108,
sometimes three 60,

2864
02:15:11,650 --> 02:15:13,390
whatever,
a commanding view of the surrounding

2865
02:15:13,391 --> 02:15:14,224
landscape.

2866
02:15:14,410 --> 02:15:19,410
And we generally hunt by sitting there
and observing a with binoculars and just

2867
02:15:23,771 --> 02:15:24,610
watching,
watching,

2868
02:15:24,611 --> 02:15:28,150
watching to the point where sometimes
we'll spend days doing nothing but

2869
02:15:28,151 --> 02:15:32,020
watching animals through binoculars.
And um,

2870
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:33,660
and when you get good at this,
you,

2871
02:15:33,700 --> 02:15:37,270
you find animals that people would never
in a million years find that other

2872
02:15:37,271 --> 02:15:40,930
people would never in a million years
locate when I'm doing that and I find a

2873
02:15:40,931 --> 02:15:45,931
bear and I'm observing a bear,
you,

2874
02:15:46,870 --> 02:15:51,870
I would never leave that bear
to go do some other thing.

2875
02:15:53,560 --> 02:15:55,760
When you find a bear,
like when I find a bear,

2876
02:15:55,790 --> 02:16:00,790
I watch him until he's gone.
You can't turn away from them because I

2877
02:16:00,941 --> 02:16:05,941
always feel like at any point he's going
to do some amazing thing that would blow

2878
02:16:06,581 --> 02:16:07,301
your mind.
Like,

2879
02:16:07,301 --> 02:16:10,420
what?
I don't like crush something skull.

2880
02:16:10,630 --> 02:16:13,330
I don't know.
They're just,

2881
02:16:13,620 --> 02:16:17,920
they like are always doing weird things.
They eat a vast array of things.

2882
02:16:17,950 --> 02:16:21,250
My friend John Dudley was watching a
bear through his binoculars and he saw a

2883
02:16:21,251 --> 02:16:25,030
bear run up on a Moose and smash it on
the back and crush it.

2884
02:16:25,450 --> 02:16:30,100
That's what I talking.
He saw grizzly smash a on the back and

2885
02:16:30,101 --> 02:16:33,760
break its back,
literally hit it so hard that it snapped

2886
02:16:33,761 --> 02:16:36,820
the Moose is back and then he tackled it
once it was down,

2887
02:16:36,821 --> 02:16:38,110
started eating.
I haven't seen that,

2888
02:16:38,111 --> 02:16:42,190
but that's what I'm looking for.
So you watch them and there's this sort

2889
02:16:42,191 --> 02:16:44,470
of anticipation was seeing them right.

2890
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:49,400
Deer,
they're very interesting and the more

2891
02:16:49,401 --> 02:16:50,930
you wash them,
the more you learn about them.

2892
02:16:50,931 --> 02:16:54,320
And the thing that I've always been
fascinated by and was talking about with

2893
02:16:54,321 --> 02:16:56,310
some friends of mine recently was,
um,

2894
02:16:56,910 --> 02:17:01,910
how interested I become an interpersonal
relationship is among mule deer,

2895
02:17:01,971 --> 02:17:06,971
like the body language they use and how
you can locate deer that you can't see

2896
02:17:08,660 --> 02:17:13,660
just based on body language of deer that
you can see that you watch them and you

2897
02:17:14,301 --> 02:17:19,301
become aware of things that are aware of
and you learn where other things are

2898
02:17:19,830 --> 02:17:22,100
that are out of your view.
Just by how,

2899
02:17:22,850 --> 02:17:25,190
just by what it's doing,
both male and female.

2900
02:17:25,910 --> 02:17:27,840
Generally it's,
it's doe,

2901
02:17:27,910 --> 02:17:32,910
not sometimes in a general,
the most obvious one is dosed that no,

2902
02:17:33,351 --> 02:17:36,770
there's a buck around.
You took me for body language there and

2903
02:17:36,771 --> 02:17:40,670
then doles that are encountering another
band of Doe's have a body language they

2904
02:17:40,671 --> 02:17:44,470
use and you just get used to this and
you sort of a base.

2905
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:46,100
Yeah,
and then once you see it you go like,

2906
02:17:46,130 --> 02:17:47,880
oh,
he knows about it.

2907
02:17:47,930 --> 02:17:52,070
There's a deer somewhere that's not net
group and that deer is aware of the fact

2908
02:17:52,071 --> 02:17:55,940
that the deer is not in the group and
it's like wondering about it and you

2909
02:17:55,941 --> 02:17:57,770
just see that.
So I'm interested that kind of stuff.

2910
02:17:57,980 --> 02:17:59,630
But I could walk away from deere.

2911
02:18:01,030 --> 02:18:02,650
You,
I could see there's some deer and I can

2912
02:18:02,651 --> 02:18:05,560
just go look in another direction.
Something about me makes me stare at

2913
02:18:05,561 --> 02:18:06,910
bears.
Wow.

2914
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:09,010
I can't give up on them.
Like I just like I'm watching them,

2915
02:18:09,011 --> 02:18:09,844
watching them,
watching them.

2916
02:18:10,180 --> 02:18:11,710
Do you have the same feeling about
wolverines?

2917
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:14,620
Does the first bull run over?
See my whole life.

2918
02:18:14,621 --> 02:18:16,510
That was the one that was the thing on
my checklist.

2919
02:18:16,570 --> 02:18:20,530
Like as far as like if you large land
mammals.

2920
02:18:20,590 --> 02:18:23,350
That was the one I was missing.
So you'd never seen one?

2921
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:23,921
I mean,
yeah,

2922
02:18:23,921 --> 02:18:25,840
large like American land,
mammals.

2923
02:18:25,841 --> 02:18:26,650
I.
That was me.

2924
02:18:26,650 --> 02:18:29,770
That was the one missing from my list.
Do you think you'd feel a feeling of

2925
02:18:29,771 --> 02:18:32,890
remorse if you shot the one that you.
The only one you saw.

2926
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:36,160
That's why I said I wasn't going to
touch that screen because of that.

2927
02:18:36,490 --> 02:18:38,140
Yeah.
I even said right then in there I said

2928
02:18:38,141 --> 02:18:40,270
I'm not going to shoot the first one is
something I saw.

2929
02:18:40,590 --> 02:18:43,460
That's how I feel like when I was saying
earlier about the black hole of Africa,

2930
02:18:43,461 --> 02:18:45,790
I always imagined that guy's going to
Africa and being like,

2931
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:47,950
no shit.
That's what one of those shoes look

2932
02:18:48,010 --> 02:18:51,890
like.
Well that's right.

2933
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,000
It is.
Yes.

2934
02:18:53,060 --> 02:18:55,450
I just didn't,
I hadn't built up a context about it.

2935
02:18:55,451 --> 02:18:58,330
So then we're like talking about.
So if you see another one,

2936
02:18:58,530 --> 02:18:59,320
yeah,
I'd,

2937
02:18:59,320 --> 02:19:00,460
I'd reconsider.
But no,

2938
02:19:00,461 --> 02:19:02,530
I didn't want to shoot the first
wolverine I ever laid eyes on.

2939
02:19:02,531 --> 02:19:04,210
That's what I was trying to get.
You know,

2940
02:19:04,211 --> 02:19:06,280
Yannis has seen,
um,

2941
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:08,950
you know,
he's been out Caribou hunting and watch

2942
02:19:08,951 --> 02:19:10,990
wolverine scavenge and Caribou
Carcasses.

2943
02:19:11,530 --> 02:19:12,341
And so I was like,
you know,

2944
02:19:12,341 --> 02:19:16,570
he's not the first one you saw and then
we just dilly dallied no one so he could

2945
02:19:16,571 --> 02:19:18,370
have shot it because it wasn't the first
one he saw,

2946
02:19:19,570 --> 02:19:22,120
but no one was feeling any.
It was just one of those things.

2947
02:19:22,121 --> 02:19:23,420
No one was feeling,
I felt,

2948
02:19:23,470 --> 02:19:24,040
you know,
great.

2949
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:26,020
Assuming I remember watching my youtube,
by the way,

2950
02:19:26,021 --> 02:19:27,980
a white tail deer looks you.
I remember watching the

2951
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:31,040
first links I ever saw and um,
I feel that,

2952
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:33,200
uh,
uh,

2953
02:19:33,380 --> 02:19:37,010
um,
anthropomorphizing a fair bit here,

2954
02:19:37,190 --> 02:19:42,190
but he was the first links that I ever
saw and I just had a strong feeling that

2955
02:19:42,981 --> 02:19:47,160
I was the first person he ever saw
a look of.

2956
02:19:47,170 --> 02:19:51,320
I'm
a look of like sheer,

2957
02:19:51,321 --> 02:19:53,330
like uncomprehensive for what he was
seeing.

2958
02:19:54,110 --> 02:19:56,510
Wow.
And he's like,

2959
02:19:57,020 --> 02:19:58,580
he's like,
is this good,

2960
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:01,700
bad?
What does this mean?

2961
02:20:02,220 --> 02:20:05,720
And you see what kind of run through all
these calculations in his mind and just

2962
02:20:05,721 --> 02:20:07,740
drift off.
Like after awhile I,

2963
02:20:07,741 --> 02:20:08,690
he's like,
Eh,

2964
02:20:09,650 --> 02:20:12,950
something about it.
This thing has got its eyes,

2965
02:20:13,170 --> 02:20:17,990
him looking at me like his eyes are
centered on his face,

2966
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:23,750
right?
Like a Predator maybe for someone tells

2967
02:20:23,751 --> 02:20:26,000
me something,
you know,

2968
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:28,940
he's looking at me very intently.
He's not trying to act like I'm not

2969
02:20:28,941 --> 02:20:31,070
there and therefore he can't see me,
you know,

2970
02:20:31,570 --> 02:20:33,950
and you just see them kind of run it
through his head and just be like,

2971
02:20:34,360 --> 02:20:34,970
yeah,
no,

2972
02:20:34,970 --> 02:20:36,380
because nothing good's going to come
out.

2973
02:20:37,570 --> 02:20:40,370
I didn't go off the road direction,
but just based on where I was.

2974
02:20:40,371 --> 02:20:41,690
Yeah.
I mean it was very safe to say he'd

2975
02:20:41,691 --> 02:20:43,990
never run into a person and I'd never
run into a length.

2976
02:20:44,030 --> 02:20:47,300
We just had this moment of um,
you know,

2977
02:20:47,301 --> 02:20:48,260
I,
I carry a,

2978
02:20:48,261 --> 02:20:48,630
an,
a,

2979
02:20:48,630 --> 02:20:52,610
a cultural awareness.
So I at least knew about what I was

2980
02:20:52,611 --> 02:20:56,480
looking at but,
but he was in this point of I'm just,

2981
02:20:56,510 --> 02:21:01,190
you know,
processing and like the white tail that

2982
02:21:01,191 --> 02:21:03,830
you encountered who damn sure knew what
that,

2983
02:21:03,860 --> 02:21:05,510
that thing carries with it.
Yeah.

2984
02:21:05,511 --> 02:21:07,490
We talked about it before the podcast
started,

2985
02:21:07,491 --> 02:21:08,324
but,
uh,

2986
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:11,660
I was hunting with my friend John Dudley
and we were in the tree stand and we

2987
02:21:11,661 --> 02:21:14,930
were supposed to get down at 1:30 and at
1:25.

2988
02:21:14,931 --> 02:21:16,270
I'm like,
what do you want you want to call it and

2989
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:17,390
then eat lunch.
He's like,

2990
02:21:17,391 --> 02:21:20,360
yeah,
so I climbed down first and that 1:25

2991
02:21:20,361 --> 02:21:24,310
like five fucking minutes before we set
it and this big mature whitetail walks

2992
02:21:24,311 --> 02:21:28,160
through and John Signals to me does the
bowl winkle thing,

2993
02:21:28,161 --> 02:21:32,030
but putting his thumbs on his head and
he starts pointing and then I realized

2994
02:21:32,031 --> 02:21:36,770
as a deer coming down the path and so I
kind of hide behind the tree,

2995
02:21:36,771 --> 02:21:38,510
but there was all these branches in
front of me.

2996
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:40,280
Anyway,
you've already heard the story,

2997
02:21:40,281 --> 02:21:43,130
but for the people listening,
that deer locked eyes with me and there

2998
02:21:43,131 --> 02:21:46,400
was this intensity,
like immediate intensity in his eyes

2999
02:21:46,580 --> 02:21:49,910
that had never experienced an animal
looking at me like it was.

3000
02:21:49,940 --> 02:21:54,020
It was very tuned in.
He knew exactly that I shouldn't be

3001
02:21:54,021 --> 02:21:56,210
there and I just froze.
I was wearing Camo.

3002
02:21:56,330 --> 02:21:58,990
He's looking me right in the face,
like right in.

3003
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,910
His eyes were bulging out of his head.
I turned around and bolted,

3004
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:07,600
but it's like electricity to them like
they know I have very vivid memories of

3005
02:22:08,060 --> 02:22:13,060
when I was 12 and had just hit legal
hunting age and Michigan and I was

3006
02:22:14,331 --> 02:22:19,331
sitting on the ground hunting squirrels
on a farm owned by a man named,

3007
02:22:20,260 --> 02:22:22,730
uh,
there a lot and

3008
02:22:24,380 --> 02:22:26,190
leaning against a tree and,
and having,

3009
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:26,881
uh,
uh,

3010
02:22:26,881 --> 02:22:31,881
for corn white tail coming through the
woods and you know,

3011
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:34,710
like this,
like a buck like that.

3012
02:22:34,740 --> 02:22:36,930
This isn't always true,
but Gianluca for chrome white tells a

3013
02:22:36,931 --> 02:22:39,450
year and a half old the way,
even at that time,

3014
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:41,730
you start hunt squirrels,
September 15 and Michigan.

3015
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:42,510
So,
I mean,

3016
02:22:42,510 --> 02:22:44,370
that deere was,
you know,

3017
02:22:44,490 --> 02:22:48,090
he could have been as little as 15,
16 months old.

3018
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:55,280
He locked on to me,
saw me and knew to look in my eyes but

3019
02:22:58,621 --> 02:23:01,530
didn't know what the Hell I was.
I remember him coming at me and coming

3020
02:23:01,531 --> 02:23:06,060
at me and coming at me and getting so
scared and I and I had always known

3021
02:23:06,061 --> 02:23:07,410
like,
you just like there's a thing you just

3022
02:23:07,411 --> 02:23:09,170
like,
you don't yell in the woods like you

3023
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:11,850
don't make noise in the woods.
You'd try to be quiet.

3024
02:23:11,851 --> 02:23:14,940
And it was.
I remember grabbing sticks and trying to

3025
02:23:14,941 --> 02:23:19,200
snap them to make a noise to make that
deer spook off,

3026
02:23:19,201 --> 02:23:22,320
you know,
but being like conflicted between just

3027
02:23:22,321 --> 02:23:25,830
being scared shitless and doing the
thing you don't do like as a hunter is

3028
02:23:25,831 --> 02:23:28,640
you just learn like don't make loud
noises in the woods when people made

3029
02:23:28,650 --> 02:23:29,190
loud noises.

3030
02:23:29,190 --> 02:23:29,480
Okay.

3031
02:23:29,480 --> 02:23:30,700
It makes me cringe,
man.

3032
02:23:30,790 --> 02:23:32,440
Well,
what's interesting about this mature

3033
02:23:32,441 --> 02:23:37,030
deer that saw me and freaked out when he
saw me is that literally a minute before

3034
02:23:37,031 --> 02:23:39,220
that,
because I was down when I was down,

3035
02:23:39,250 --> 02:23:43,810
that deer came through with two other
deer and one of 'em look to be like

3036
02:23:43,811 --> 02:23:46,300
maybe a two year old deer.
And one of them was baby.

3037
02:23:46,330 --> 02:23:49,720
One of them was like one year old and
the one year old got within 15 feet of

3038
02:23:49,721 --> 02:23:50,410
me.
Yeah.

3039
02:23:50,410 --> 02:23:53,150
I just pinned up against the tree and
the one year old walked right by me,

3040
02:23:53,170 --> 02:23:56,530
had no idea it was alive.
The other one that was younger deer

3041
02:23:57,190 --> 02:23:59,320
walked by me,
didn't look my direction at all.

3042
02:23:59,350 --> 02:24:01,510
The old one looked right at me.
He's like,

3043
02:24:01,511 --> 02:24:05,560
fuck this.
He knew right away he'd seen people

3044
02:24:05,561 --> 02:24:08,830
before maybe.
I mean they're in Iowa and I was really

3045
02:24:08,831 --> 02:24:12,430
different because I always a great state
for bow hunting because they have a very

3046
02:24:12,431 --> 02:24:14,260
short gun season.
It's only shotgun.

3047
02:24:14,560 --> 02:24:15,351
So.
Oh yeah.

3048
02:24:15,351 --> 02:24:17,350
Yeah.
You don't get a big rifle heart.

3049
02:24:17,351 --> 02:24:19,470
Right.
So a lot of what they're dealing with is

3050
02:24:19,490 --> 02:24:21,430
a bowhunters.
So He.

3051
02:24:21,431 --> 02:24:23,170
I mean,
he might've known that I had a bow.

3052
02:24:23,230 --> 02:24:24,220
I mean,
who the fuck knows?

3053
02:24:24,470 --> 02:24:26,950
Saw a bow and say,
I've seen that fucking thing before.

3054
02:24:26,980 --> 02:24:29,350
Somebody shot me in the ass with one of
those a year ago.

3055
02:24:29,590 --> 02:24:30,650
That's one of the things I like that egg

3056
02:24:30,670 --> 02:24:31,700
about big bucks.
I,

3057
02:24:31,820 --> 02:24:35,420
you know,
I think that culturally in this country

3058
02:24:35,421 --> 02:24:38,540
we're kind of getting where it's almost
like this thick accepted idea that

3059
02:24:38,541 --> 02:24:40,460
you're supposed to hate trophy hunters.
Right.

3060
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:45,760
But um,
I eat everything I kill and I will even

3061
02:24:46,401 --> 02:24:49,160
talk about there's like meat box and
shooter box,

3062
02:24:49,161 --> 02:24:50,600
right?
And meaning like there's like big huge

3063
02:24:50,601 --> 02:24:54,200
box that are cool and meat box they eat,
but I always eat my shooter box.

3064
02:24:54,740 --> 02:24:55,460
It's like,
you know,

3065
02:24:55,460 --> 02:24:57,200
like shoot,
a big buck is elite one.

3066
02:24:57,201 --> 02:24:57,951
It's illegal.
Two,

3067
02:24:57,951 --> 02:25:00,410
I love them.
You can Pepsi challenge them.

3068
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:02,650
I can.
Pepsi challenge of five-year-old deer

3069
02:25:02,670 --> 02:25:04,400
and in a two year old deer and you
can't.

3070
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:06,740
Well you can because you're really good
at cooking.

3071
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:07,941
Yeah.
But I'm saying it's good.

3072
02:25:07,941 --> 02:25:09,620
Yeah.
If you know how to cut it and trim it

3073
02:25:09,621 --> 02:25:10,670
and stuff,
they're great.

3074
02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:11,630
Right?
Yeah.

3075
02:25:11,630 --> 02:25:16,630
So point being I do like to look for big
animals.

3076
02:25:17,790 --> 02:25:18,650
Okay.
I like,

3077
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:22,190
like if you,
if I have to deer and I can go after a

3078
02:25:22,191 --> 02:25:24,400
small one or go after one,
I like to go after the big one.

3079
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:27,580
One of the things I like about going
after the big one and the challenge of

3080
02:25:27,581 --> 02:25:32,581
it is that they are harder to get and
the reason they're harder to get it

3081
02:25:32,980 --> 02:25:36,760
because they have learned from mistakes,
you know,

3082
02:25:37,690 --> 02:25:38,760
a big buck to,
uh,

3083
02:25:38,770 --> 02:25:39,520
to,
uh,

3084
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:40,090
to,
uh,

3085
02:25:40,090 --> 02:25:42,670
experienced hunter when he sees a big
buck.

3086
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:46,750
He sees more than the antlers,
the antlers one up kind of becoming like

3087
02:25:46,751 --> 02:25:51,751
symbolic of something of a very worthy,
challenging cory because he hasn't made

3088
02:25:52,781 --> 02:25:54,460
any mistakes yet,
right?

3089
02:25:54,910 --> 02:25:59,060
You can have big box in areas that have
very low predation and low hunter

3090
02:25:59,061 --> 02:26:03,670
pressure and he could get big and still
make some mistakes because he doesn't

3091
02:26:03,671 --> 02:26:06,220
have as many mistakes that could be
made.

3092
02:26:07,030 --> 02:26:10,770
But a really big buck and an area that
has a lot of lines,

3093
02:26:10,790 --> 02:26:12,820
a lot of coyotes,
wolves,

3094
02:26:13,480 --> 02:26:15,150
human hunters.
Um,

3095
02:26:15,790 --> 02:26:17,470
he's big because he doesn't,
he hasn't messed up,

3096
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:19,600
he hasn't fucked up,
doesn't fuck up.

3097
02:26:20,290 --> 02:26:22,000
He remembers stuff,
you know,

3098
02:26:22,270 --> 02:26:26,140
we had a occasion to watch.
We're hunting in Colorado hunt mule deer

3099
02:26:26,141 --> 02:26:28,810
this year.
And we watched,

3100
02:26:29,060 --> 02:26:31,570
um,
I glanced up at pretty nice buck and

3101
02:26:31,571 --> 02:26:35,830
they went up and do an aspen grove.
He was traveling with a bunch of dose

3102
02:26:35,890 --> 02:26:38,710
and they all go into an aspen grove
later.

3103
02:26:38,711 --> 02:26:41,050
Yannis was looking above there and he
said,

3104
02:26:41,051 --> 02:26:45,430
there's some coyotes rolling down into
that aspen grove where all the deer,

3105
02:26:45,431 --> 02:26:49,180
when it's now the middle of the day and
it's rifle season,

3106
02:26:49,181 --> 02:26:52,210
has been rifle season on and off through
a couple of weeks of hunting season,

3107
02:26:53,830 --> 02:26:57,910
the coyotes go into the Aspen Grove.
All those deer component out of that

3108
02:26:57,911 --> 02:26:58,480
Aspen Grove.

3109
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:01,420
I at the time comment on how it seemed
like someone like squeezing a tube of

3110
02:27:01,421 --> 02:27:03,940
toothpaste,
the way the deer came shooting out of

3111
02:27:03,941 --> 02:27:08,941
that Aspen Grove and ran out across a
large sage flat exposing themselves.

3112
02:27:11,080 --> 02:27:14,740
The one deer out of the group that
didn't walk out of that stage,

3113
02:27:14,980 --> 02:27:16,960
that didn't walk out of that Aspen Grove
was the big buck.

3114
02:27:18,010 --> 02:27:23,010
Never budged because he ran a
calculation in his head where he's like,

3115
02:27:25,510 --> 02:27:28,420
I get it.
Y'all scared of those coyotes.

3116
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:32,170
I'm afraid of the unknown.
I would rather stay in here and my

3117
02:27:32,171 --> 02:27:35,170
little thicket and he stood up,
we could see him stand up in there,

3118
02:27:35,340 --> 02:27:38,590
that son of a bitch would not move and
that's during the Rut.

3119
02:27:38,591 --> 02:27:42,280
So every thing in his body is saying
chase those donors and breed those dogs.

3120
02:27:42,281 --> 02:27:44,290
That's all he's thinking about.
His breeding dose.

3121
02:27:45,100 --> 02:27:47,470
A dumb Bach would have chased those.

3122
02:27:47,470 --> 02:27:51,220
Those if not for fear of the coyote,
he would've chased the dose just because

3123
02:27:51,250 --> 02:27:53,050
for fear of that,
another buck is going to go breed them.

3124
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:56,490
But he resisted that.
Right?

3125
02:27:56,980 --> 02:27:59,710
He resisted the fear of the coyotes,
but he's like,

3126
02:27:59,800 --> 02:28:03,940
I know that there is trouble when you
run out in the open

3127
02:28:05,780 --> 02:28:07,810
shit shoots at you or whatever.
He knew.

3128
02:28:08,410 --> 02:28:10,090
Wow.
He just sweated it out,

3129
02:28:11,890 --> 02:28:13,600
you know?
Wow.

3130
02:28:13,601 --> 02:28:16,960
So it's like he didn't like and he
lived.

3131
02:28:17,860 --> 02:28:19,050
He didn't mess up.
Well,

3132
02:28:19,060 --> 02:28:22,340
a big book like that is also kind of
threatening to a coyote to.

3133
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:23,720
I'm sure.
I'm sure that's part of it.

3134
02:28:23,780 --> 02:28:24,620
Yeah,
sure.

3135
02:28:24,621 --> 02:28:26,570
As part of it,
but it's just like he,

3136
02:28:26,610 --> 02:28:31,010
there's a threat in instinctively or
whatever because here's the thing that

3137
02:28:31,011 --> 02:28:33,410
they weren't,
they were not interested in those deer.

3138
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:36,230
They weren't chasing him.
I think they know because they see they

3139
02:28:36,231 --> 02:28:38,350
lose Fonz to them all the time.
Right.

3140
02:28:38,390 --> 02:28:40,520
I mean they see stuff die from,
but it's like,

3141
02:28:40,550 --> 02:28:41,990
you know,
right now there's a couple of.

3142
02:28:41,991 --> 02:28:45,890
Kyle's is at that time of year isn't
going to drag down a healthy fire.

3143
02:28:45,891 --> 02:28:47,090
Mueller,
they weren't even chasing him,

3144
02:28:47,450 --> 02:28:48,500
but he just like,
he knew,

3145
02:28:49,160 --> 02:28:50,450
you know.
Um,

3146
02:28:50,780 --> 02:28:53,810
and that's one of the things I admire
about like the old ones,

3147
02:28:54,050 --> 02:28:56,540
if you can consider,
if you can go into areas that have heavy

3148
02:28:56,541 --> 02:28:59,060
hunting pressure and consistently find
those deer,

3149
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:00,170
it's,
you know,

3150
02:29:00,170 --> 02:29:03,710
it's like,
it's the highest challenge.

3151
02:29:03,770 --> 02:29:04,603
Yeah,
man,

3152
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:06,950
I respect it.
I respect it.

3153
02:29:07,070 --> 02:29:09,230
Well,
it's a very difficult quarry and when

3154
02:29:09,231 --> 02:29:11,350
you're eating that animal,
I mean there's,

3155
02:29:11,390 --> 02:29:13,820
there's,
there's a completely different sense of

3156
02:29:14,060 --> 02:29:16,430
not just accomplishment but connection
to that animal.

3157
02:29:16,431 --> 02:29:21,431
Then buying some stake in a store or
shooting some button buck.

3158
02:29:21,770 --> 02:29:24,710
Oh yeah.
It's such a.

3159
02:29:25,380 --> 02:29:28,730
that's the thing that winds up being
like such an obvious conversation that

3160
02:29:28,731 --> 02:29:33,731
it's that you sometimes feel like it's.
I'm done having that conversation with

3161
02:29:33,861 --> 02:29:35,870
people who don't get is like shooting
fish in a barrel.

3162
02:29:36,090 --> 02:29:38,540
Right?
It's like so obvious and so easy that

3163
02:29:38,570 --> 02:29:43,280
you almost feel like a little bit like,
like almost unfair to bring it up.

3164
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:45,620
Will you say that like,
yeah.

3165
02:29:45,621 --> 02:29:49,700
Why do something like pro for the same
reason why you challenged to chase after

3166
02:29:49,701 --> 02:29:54,020
big bucks?
Like you're telling me that somehow you

3167
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:58,550
like if you eat meat,
that somehow the system by which you go

3168
02:29:58,551 --> 02:30:03,551
about getting meat to farms and stores
and Shit like that is somehow morally or

3169
02:30:05,390 --> 02:30:10,390
aesthetically or or ethically are
somehow superior to me eating an animal

3170
02:30:12,170 --> 02:30:16,130
that I've hunted myself from a
sustainable population as well managed

3171
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:21,340
and that I've decorated my home with
it's parts that will be there until I

3172
02:30:23,031 --> 02:30:26,720
die and then we'll decorate the homes of
my children.

3173
02:30:27,140 --> 02:30:29,930
If you're telling me somehow that I'm
like depraved

3174
02:30:31,910 --> 02:30:34,220
for that,
I have a hard time engaging in the

3175
02:30:34,221 --> 02:30:37,220
conversation because I can't.
I just don't understand it well with

3176
02:30:37,221 --> 02:30:38,000
other mediators years.

3177
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:42,050
It's a ridiculous conversation.
It's very short sided conversation and

3178
02:30:42,051 --> 02:30:45,080
it's part of the problem is that people
have so many things going on in their

3179
02:30:45,081 --> 02:30:48,590
lives there.
If you have a job and you have a family

3180
02:30:48,591 --> 02:30:51,830
and you have some sort of hobby,
you've eliminated 90 percent of your

3181
02:30:51,831 --> 02:30:54,110
time.
How much time do you have to actually

3182
02:30:54,111 --> 02:30:56,960
immerse yourself in wildlife and
understand the politics of it,

3183
02:30:56,961 --> 02:30:59,540
understand what's really going on out
there in the world.

3184
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:04,520
How many people have actually seen an
overhead view of the Pacific northwest

3185
02:31:04,521 --> 02:31:09,521
and looked down at all the forest and
just done the calculations in their head

3186
02:31:10,101 --> 02:31:14,360
about these animals and how many of them
there are and how much of the wild west

3187
02:31:14,361 --> 02:31:18,350
is filled with animals.
And that doesn't stop people from having

3188
02:31:18,351 --> 02:31:19,640
opinions of,
of course,

3189
02:31:19,650 --> 02:31:20,160
does it.

3190
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,260
They're just not educated.
It's the reason why.

3191
02:31:22,350 --> 02:31:23,183
And,
uh,

3192
02:31:23,370 --> 02:31:28,370
is the reason why after all these years,
I still have no opinion on obamacare

3193
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:32,700
because I do not understand it.
So I'll point out like I have no opinion

3194
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:36,060
now trying to have this infectious
result on people where people will stop

3195
02:31:36,061 --> 02:31:37,960
talking about shit they don't fully
understand.

3196
02:31:38,190 --> 02:31:40,620
No.
People have these knee jerk opinions.

3197
02:31:40,650 --> 02:31:43,440
They're just,
they lock them in like this is as a left

3198
02:31:43,441 --> 02:31:45,870
wing person.
I think this is a right wing person.

3199
02:31:45,871 --> 02:31:47,880
I think that,
I think as we pointed out,

3200
02:31:47,881 --> 02:31:48,670
you and I both,

3201
02:31:48,670 --> 02:31:51,580
I believe that that's a ridiculous
perspective.

3202
02:31:51,670 --> 02:31:54,300
Can I close a bit of flattery please?
Um,

3203
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:57,310
it didn't occur to me til I was coming
down here today,

3204
02:31:57,520 --> 02:32:01,330
but I've been railing a lot on,
uh,

3205
02:32:01,960 --> 02:32:02,550
the,
the,

3206
02:32:02,550 --> 02:32:06,800
the echo chamber that we all live in.
Um,

3207
02:32:06,910 --> 02:32:09,330
and I think if anyone goes and you look
at your,

3208
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:14,650
you look at your facebook feed or any
number of things like we surround

3209
02:32:14,651 --> 02:32:18,460
ourselves with people who tell us what
we think,

3210
02:32:18,940 --> 02:32:20,940
you know,
and it's kind of become very obvious and

3211
02:32:20,950 --> 02:32:24,820
I think that this presidential election
cycle really brought it out where you

3212
02:32:24,821 --> 02:32:29,821
had just two vastly different narratives
playing out and people on each side of

3213
02:32:30,881 --> 02:32:33,940
it feeling like so absolutely certain
that not only were they right,

3214
02:32:33,941 --> 02:32:37,250
but everyone felt the way they felt.
Okay.

3215
02:32:37,580 --> 02:32:39,340
Right.
And it's just been a big part of the

3216
02:32:39,341 --> 02:32:41,320
national conversation.
Like the echo chamber thing.

3217
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:45,610
Um,
what I have found with people that

3218
02:32:45,611 --> 02:32:47,770
listen to your show who come up to me
and be like,

3219
02:32:47,771 --> 02:32:49,000
oh,
I heard you on Joe show.

3220
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:51,310
The Times I've been on there is that you
haven't,

3221
02:32:51,880 --> 02:32:56,880
you've somehow managed to defy that
where you have the,

3222
02:33:00,020 --> 02:33:04,910
the right wing nut jobs and the left
wing nut jobs all listening to at the

3223
02:33:04,911 --> 02:33:08,670
same time
in the middle of the rotors.

3224
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:12,930
But like when someone calls up and says,
I was listening to Joe Rogan podcast,

3225
02:33:13,250 --> 02:33:15,530
I'm always thinking like,
like,

3226
02:33:15,620 --> 02:33:18,890
what does that make you?
It doesn't mean anything.

3227
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:21,970
It's like,
I don't know,

3228
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:23,980
just the fact that you listened to it.
I don't know what.

3229
02:33:24,220 --> 02:33:28,480
That doesn't tell me anything about you.
Other than that you'd like to wrestle

3230
02:33:28,481 --> 02:33:32,500
with ideas because this is one of the
few places where people are talking

3231
02:33:32,501 --> 02:33:36,190
about shit and you talk about stuff and
bring it up where it's like people are

3232
02:33:36,490 --> 02:33:38,770
willing because of you in the way you're
handling it.

3233
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:43,330
They're willing to subject themselves to
disparate views for a minute.

3234
02:33:44,150 --> 02:33:47,770
And I don't know what it is,
the formula if you've even thought about

3235
02:33:47,771 --> 02:33:49,540
it,
but it's a nice invention.

3236
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:51,980
Uh,
it's just how I look at things.

3237
02:33:51,981 --> 02:33:53,530
I think I don't,
uh,

3238
02:33:53,570 --> 02:33:56,480
you know,
I have my rigid lines that I won't

3239
02:33:56,481 --> 02:33:57,314
cross,
you know,

3240
02:33:57,390 --> 02:34:00,800
where I think something is evil or
something is ethically wrong.

3241
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:02,870
But I'm willing to entertain ideas and
I'm not,

3242
02:34:03,350 --> 02:34:06,740
I'm not rigid.
Like if if someone comes to me and they

3243
02:34:06,741 --> 02:34:09,530
tell me that I'm wrong about something,
I'll go really like,

3244
02:34:09,531 --> 02:34:10,550
how am I,
how am I wrong?

3245
02:34:10,970 --> 02:34:12,230
If they tell me I'm wrong,
I'm like,

3246
02:34:12,290 --> 02:34:13,790
Oh,
I'm fucking wrong.

3247
02:34:13,970 --> 02:34:16,940
I didn't know it was wrong.
Like I'm not married to my ideas and I

3248
02:34:17,140 --> 02:34:19,360
that's,
that's a real problem that people have

3249
02:34:19,540 --> 02:34:22,240
where they define themselves by their
knowledge they,

3250
02:34:22,310 --> 02:34:27,310
they think they're smart or they're.
They think they're valuable because they

3251
02:34:27,521 --> 02:34:29,890
have a certain amount of information in
their head and I think that's crazy

3252
02:34:29,891 --> 02:34:32,740
because there's,
especially as you start getting into

3253
02:34:32,770 --> 02:34:36,250
more things or get exploring new
subjects and new topics,

3254
02:34:36,251 --> 02:34:38,650
you realize it is impossible to know
everything.

3255
02:34:38,710 --> 02:34:42,320
It's not possible.
So for you to define yourself by the

3256
02:34:42,370 --> 02:34:45,190
knowledge that you know or the knowledge
you don't know,

3257
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:48,880
it seems kind of crazy.
I think you're far better off defining

3258
02:34:48,881 --> 02:34:50,200
yourself,
not even defining yourself,

3259
02:34:50,201 --> 02:34:55,201
but far better off approaching the world
by searching for the truth,

3260
02:34:56,230 --> 02:34:58,540
you know,
and not being connected or married to

3261
02:34:58,541 --> 02:35:02,050
any ideas.
It's far too often people get into these

3262
02:35:02,080 --> 02:35:06,670
discussions with people and it becomes a
game of trying to win,

3263
02:35:06,990 --> 02:35:08,830
you know,
trying to one up the person with

3264
02:35:08,831 --> 02:35:10,750
information or data and then coming
along,

3265
02:35:10,810 --> 02:35:12,670
coming off of that with the victory.
Yeah,

3266
02:35:12,671 --> 02:35:13,330
no,
I'm with you.

3267
02:35:13,330 --> 02:35:14,920
Yeah,
I mean that's what you're seeing on all

3268
02:35:14,921 --> 02:35:16,090
these news shows,
man.

3269
02:35:16,120 --> 02:35:18,130
You seen.
One of the things that I did during the

3270
02:35:18,131 --> 02:35:20,850
election was while the debates were
going on in and post debate,

3271
02:35:21,050 --> 02:35:24,760
I would bounce back and forth and spend
an hour on Fox News and an hour on cnn

3272
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:27,160
and I was like,
what is the world like?

3273
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:31,510
This is so baffling because these are,
these are just enforced narratives from

3274
02:35:31,511 --> 02:35:33,710
one side and the other.
And I think the,

3275
02:35:34,010 --> 02:35:35,920
the,
the country suffers because of that.

3276
02:35:35,921 --> 02:35:39,430
People suffer because of that.
It's a tribal inclination that I think

3277
02:35:39,431 --> 02:35:40,910
we have to,
uh,

3278
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:46,000
to support one side or the other or to
adopt these predetermined patterns of

3279
02:35:46,091 --> 02:35:51,091
behavior are predetermined belief
systems or the or that it's shameful to

3280
02:35:51,431 --> 02:35:52,840
switch positions.
Yeah.

3281
02:35:52,841 --> 02:35:56,650
That it's a flip flopper like how the
fuck do you not learn?

3282
02:35:56,651 --> 02:35:57,460
I mean he,
he,

3283
02:35:57,460 --> 02:36:01,180
you can't be right all the time and you
can have preconceived notions that

3284
02:36:01,181 --> 02:36:03,970
turned out to be incorrect and you have
to be able to recognize those.

3285
02:36:04,340 --> 02:36:05,173
Yeah,

3286
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:08,980
it's good.
I enjoy like I enjoy talking to you.

3287
02:36:09,210 --> 02:36:12,130
Oh,
thank you.

3288
02:36:12,310 --> 02:36:13,270
It's always fun.
Bad.

3289
02:36:13,470 --> 02:36:16,440
We should definitely do this more often.
But I think um,

3290
02:36:16,660 --> 02:36:17,560
yeah,
I mean I,

3291
02:36:17,561 --> 02:36:19,960
I appreciate that perspective that you
have to,

3292
02:36:19,961 --> 02:36:23,740
that you are willing to say it was like
I don't have an opinion on obamacare

3293
02:36:23,800 --> 02:36:25,930
because I really don't know know enough
about it.

3294
02:36:26,130 --> 02:36:28,720
That's,
that's really healthy and really

3295
02:36:28,721 --> 02:36:31,630
important and for some reason really
rare,

3296
02:36:31,690 --> 02:36:33,820
especially with a well read person like
yourself.

3297
02:36:33,910 --> 02:36:35,450
It makes you sound a little bit like a
dumb ass.

3298
02:36:35,970 --> 02:36:38,560
I sound like a dumb ass all the time,
but I'm willing to say it,

3299
02:36:38,590 --> 02:36:39,910
you know,
you know,

3300
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:43,120
I would be remiss if we ended this
podcast without discussing the revenant

3301
02:36:43,350 --> 02:36:47,050
because you fucking crushed me on that.
I love that movie.

3302
02:36:47,051 --> 02:36:49,570
I thought it was bad ass and I found out
it was all bullshit.

3303
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:51,360
I,
I only have a couple minutes.

3304
02:36:51,361 --> 02:36:52,470
I got a,
I got to leave,

3305
02:36:52,471 --> 02:36:53,304
but I'll,
uh,

3306
02:36:54,120 --> 02:36:57,150
explain everything that was bullshit
about the revenue first I want to say,

3307
02:36:57,520 --> 02:36:58,550
um,
my,

3308
02:36:58,610 --> 02:37:03,270
my dear friend and colleague,
Mo Fallon loves the revenue.

3309
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:05,100
I love Mo.
He was out of town.

3310
02:37:05,110 --> 02:37:05,580
I,
He was,

3311
02:37:05,580 --> 02:37:06,920
he was hoping to come by and say hi.
But he's,

3312
02:37:06,930 --> 02:37:07,890
he's in a,
he's in.

3313
02:37:08,130 --> 02:37:10,530
Where is he?
He's in the middle east somewhere.

3314
02:37:11,290 --> 02:37:13,080
No,
he's in Oman right now in Jordan.

3315
02:37:13,350 --> 02:37:14,790
So he,
uh,

3316
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:18,620
he loves it because it's cinematography
and that's the end of the conversation

3317
02:37:18,621 --> 02:37:22,490
for him,
but he's a cinematographer right now as

3318
02:37:22,491 --> 02:37:24,500
a student of american history and
someone who,

3319
02:37:24,501 --> 02:37:28,860
who's favorite era is the mountain man
era,

3320
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:32,900
which,
which ran away to define the mountain

3321
02:37:32,901 --> 02:37:36,860
man and rob.
It began kind of like the moment lewis

3322
02:37:36,861 --> 02:37:41,861
and clark made it back to st louis after
their expedition and a man named john

3323
02:37:42,051 --> 02:37:46,850
colter turned around and went back out
west to trap beaver.

3324
02:37:47,450 --> 02:37:52,450
The mountain man era began.
One could argue that day and it ended

3325
02:37:53,550 --> 02:37:57,000
when the last rendezvous was held for
the free trappers,

3326
02:37:57,001 --> 02:37:59,040
which is an 18 forties,
very short period of time.

3327
02:38:00,270 --> 02:38:03,540
That's my favorite time period of
american history is the mountain man era

3328
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:06,270
and it was um,
the,

3329
02:38:06,410 --> 02:38:09,210
the,
the great escapades and discoveries and

3330
02:38:09,211 --> 02:38:12,330
adventure to the mountain men played out
in the arid west,

3331
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:14,563
uh,

3332
02:38:14,790 --> 02:38:19,790
in the willow lined riparian zones of
the american great plains and into

3333
02:38:20,711 --> 02:38:25,711
Montana and valleys
by taking the most famous story from the

3334
02:38:25,891 --> 02:38:28,700
mountain man era,
which was the mauling by bare of,

3335
02:38:29,350 --> 02:38:32,790
um,
how was his name not cold,

3336
02:38:32,820 --> 02:38:35,070
was his name,
glass glass.

3337
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:40,760
By taking that story and setting it in
the nbc along the edges of the boreal

3338
02:38:42,241 --> 02:38:47,241
forest and a sop and dripping landscape
of conifers,

3339
02:38:49,420 --> 02:38:50,253
uh,

3340
02:38:51,500 --> 02:38:53,850
was a,
was just a distortion of,

3341
02:38:53,890 --> 02:38:55,910
of every.
It'd be like if you were making a movie

3342
02:38:55,911 --> 02:39:00,020
about the people who came when,
when Washington and franklin and

3343
02:39:00,021 --> 02:39:03,560
everyone came together to drop the
american constitution and you set it

3344
02:39:03,561 --> 02:39:07,390
like in the jungles of Thailand.
Okay.

3345
02:39:08,300 --> 02:39:12,470
It's like instead of philadelphia,
it just struck me to the core.

3346
02:39:12,530 --> 02:39:16,970
Everything.
Hugh glass did not have a child.

3347
02:39:17,910 --> 02:39:19,880
You didn't have a son who he was
avenging.

3348
02:39:20,390 --> 02:39:22,790
Hugo asked,
got mauled by a bear and they left him

3349
02:39:22,791 --> 02:39:26,630
in the protection of jim bridger,
a very young jim bridger was a teenager

3350
02:39:27,320 --> 02:39:30,560
and another guy and hugh glass through
much struggled,

3351
02:39:30,590 --> 02:39:35,590
crawled his way back to I'm a fort and
he later confronted bridger

3352
02:39:38,670 --> 02:39:39,830
and said,
just so you know,

3353
02:39:39,831 --> 02:39:42,120
a body,
next time someone leaves you to watch a

3354
02:39:42,121 --> 02:39:45,300
guy died in the woods,
don't leave them laying around by

3355
02:39:45,301 --> 02:39:46,980
himself,
and that was all he did.

3356
02:39:48,030 --> 02:39:50,130
That's it.
It's a story of forgiveness.

3357
02:39:50,470 --> 02:39:52,800
Whoa.
Now in the movie,

3358
02:39:52,801 --> 02:39:56,460
he does forgive Bridger who cowers,
but then he has to go after the guy that

3359
02:39:56,461 --> 02:39:57,810
killed the son.
He didn't have.

3360
02:39:58,320 --> 02:40:02,460
And it's like,
if you love the story as it exists,

3361
02:40:03,180 --> 02:40:05,190
to me it's like the bible.
It'd be like if you were going to go

3362
02:40:05,191 --> 02:40:08,400
film a movie about the bible,
but change real big parts of it.

3363
02:40:08,510 --> 02:40:10,380
He added aliens.
Yeah.

3364
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:13,950
Or like it was how people,
when

3365
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:17,220
it was help is probably how people felt
when last temptation of christ came out

3366
02:40:19,050 --> 02:40:20,160
and they had,
you know,

3367
02:40:20,161 --> 02:40:23,720
the christ figure lusting for,
can't remember,

3368
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:25,060
you know,
people were like,

3369
02:40:25,110 --> 02:40:26,190
it was an abomination.
Right.

3370
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:29,340
Um,
so for me to like take parts of,

3371
02:40:29,400 --> 02:40:33,570
of,
of a story that demonstrates sort of the

3372
02:40:33,571 --> 02:40:38,571
american landscape and american grit and
turn it into a british colombian,

3373
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:40,890
um,
you knoW,

3374
02:40:40,900 --> 02:40:43,200
uh,
a canadian farce.

3375
02:40:43,720 --> 02:40:45,600
It just was insulting to me.
Well,

3376
02:40:45,601 --> 02:40:48,480
how about the fact that he fell off a
cliff and landed on a tree.

3377
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:51,180
The lot of that stuff was offsets all
fake.

3378
02:40:51,900 --> 02:40:53,060
None of that happened?
No.

3379
02:40:53,100 --> 02:40:55,650
He did a lot of crawling and I think he
ate a rattlesnake.

3380
02:40:55,770 --> 02:40:58,410
he did come across.
He stoled,

3381
02:40:58,411 --> 02:41:00,270
uh,
he came across a,

3382
02:41:00,300 --> 02:41:03,660
a,
a wolf kill and scavenge some parts from

3383
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:04,900
and most will use doing this kroll.

3384
02:41:04,900 --> 02:41:07,360
Who could he walk it all?
You know,

3385
02:41:07,400 --> 02:41:08,970
I don't know at wHat point he started
walking.

3386
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,820
He started out crawling.
It's a great story.

3387
02:41:12,140 --> 02:41:15,690
I have done damn movie like that.
I would have called it the crawling

3388
02:41:15,691 --> 02:41:20,160
person,
sort of like toM hanks and lost right

3389
02:41:20,161 --> 02:41:22,140
when he's on the island and it's a lot
of struggle,

3390
02:41:22,170 --> 02:41:24,540
right?
It's not likE he makes his own teletype

3391
02:41:24,541 --> 02:41:28,830
machine and start sending messages to
the rest of the world and I could see

3392
02:41:28,831 --> 02:41:29,750
how it went.
Like I've,

3393
02:41:29,810 --> 02:41:31,450
you know,
I've been around in business enough

3394
02:41:31,451 --> 02:41:35,850
where I can see that there's,
there are forces at play where they

3395
02:41:35,851 --> 02:41:37,890
probably went in,
they were saying,

3396
02:41:37,891 --> 02:41:40,200
you know what,
I get all that shit,

3397
02:41:40,201 --> 02:41:41,870
but you better put a love interest in
this.

3398
02:41:42,800 --> 02:41:45,330
Well,
isn't that a lot of ways similar to your

3399
02:41:45,331 --> 02:41:48,000
experiences in hollywood when you were
doing your first show?

3400
02:41:48,060 --> 02:41:49,080
Yeah.
You kNow,

3401
02:41:49,170 --> 02:41:50,003
I mean,
uh,

3402
02:41:50,310 --> 02:41:52,520
what was it the wild within wild within.
Yeah,

3403
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:55,440
when I,
when I saw your first show and then I

3404
02:41:55,441 --> 02:41:58,470
spoke with you about it and you know,
they're telling me like they were trying

3405
02:41:58,471 --> 02:42:00,210
to like let him loose loose and then you
would shoot it.

3406
02:42:00,211 --> 02:42:01,810
They had like a captain.
He was just,

3407
02:42:01,860 --> 02:42:04,750
it was an early cOnversation I had where
I was trying to explain it.

3408
02:42:04,751 --> 02:42:05,850
I'm like,
no one's pretty hard,

3409
02:42:05,851 --> 02:42:07,410
like a lot of times stuff doesn't show
up.

3410
02:42:07,411 --> 02:42:10,340
And the guy who I later became friends
with and have a lot of respect for him,

3411
02:42:10,420 --> 02:42:12,390
but he was new to huntington,
was not,

3412
02:42:12,570 --> 02:42:14,280
was not new to television,
was new to hunting.

3413
02:42:14,281 --> 02:42:14,791
And he would say,
well,

3414
02:42:14,791 --> 02:42:17,580
that's why they have animal wranglers.
And that's Just one of the,

3415
02:42:17,581 --> 02:42:19,440
you know,
one of the early conversations we had,

3416
02:42:19,560 --> 02:42:22,110
I wound up liking quite a bit.

3417
02:42:22,110 --> 02:42:22,861
But yeah,
it was,

3418
02:42:22,861 --> 02:42:24,690
uh,
I think that one of the things that gets

3419
02:42:24,691 --> 02:42:29,250
reality television in trouble,
there's a fake anecdote I often tell

3420
02:42:29,251 --> 02:42:32,190
about about two kinds of producers,
right?

3421
02:42:32,250 --> 02:42:35,250
Like a,
it was a producer who would say to you,

3422
02:42:35,310 --> 02:42:38,130
how would you do that?
Whatever you're doing.

3423
02:42:39,180 --> 02:42:39,811
And you'd Say,
well,

3424
02:42:39,811 --> 02:42:44,811
I'd take this really small little knife
and I'd very carefully make a really

3425
02:42:46,590 --> 02:42:51,590
delicate little incision right here.
And they would say,

3426
02:42:51,870 --> 02:42:56,010
great film that.
And then there are ones that would go,

3427
02:42:56,070 --> 02:42:58,710
but could you use a machete?
And I think that,

3428
02:42:58,711 --> 02:43:00,660
um,
you know,

3429
02:43:00,840 --> 02:43:04,620
and those are two types of,
you know,

3430
02:43:04,680 --> 02:43:09,680
and luckily in my career I've now I'm
able to surround myself with people who,

3431
02:43:11,350 --> 02:43:13,000
who liked that little small knife.

3432
02:43:14,010 --> 02:43:16,200
Well,
you got very fortunate in that you went

3433
02:43:16,201 --> 02:43:19,500
to the sportsmans channel,
which gives you essentially free reign.

3434
02:43:19,770 --> 02:43:20,910
Yeah.
They don't mess with us.

3435
02:43:21,080 --> 02:43:21,690
Yeah.
That,

3436
02:43:21,690 --> 02:43:24,810
that I bought.
I just loved working with them in the

3437
02:43:24,811 --> 02:43:26,490
way that they've just allowed us to make
a,

3438
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:30,380
just allowed us to do our own thing.
Um,

3439
02:43:31,220 --> 02:43:33,630
there's a lot of trust there and there's
a leap of faith there and I'd like to

3440
02:43:33,631 --> 02:43:35,580
think we haven't let them down.
But um,

3441
02:43:35,720 --> 02:43:39,290
well you are definitely onto that trust
and I think that's one of the reasons

3442
02:43:39,291 --> 02:43:42,590
why your shows the first show of its
kind to be on netflix.

3443
02:43:42,980 --> 02:43:45,950
And uh,
I think it's educating a lot of people.

3444
02:43:45,951 --> 02:43:50,180
It's not just a show that's a show
preaching to the choir,

3445
02:43:50,210 --> 02:43:52,160
you know,
it's not just a show for enthusiasts,

3446
02:43:52,161 --> 02:43:54,590
it's a,
it's a show that gives you an insight

3447
02:43:54,591 --> 02:43:57,050
and a perspective into it.
I think you're the guy to do it too,

3448
02:43:57,051 --> 02:43:59,510
because I think the ethics that you
carry,

3449
02:43:59,960 --> 02:44:01,920
you know,
like here's an important distinction,

3450
02:44:01,921 --> 02:44:06,921
like even though it's legal to use
walkie talkies and certain things in

3451
02:44:07,701 --> 02:44:12,701
some places you don't want to use them.
And I had this thought the other day

3452
02:44:13,760 --> 02:44:18,500
because I was listening to this podcast
and these guys were discussing different

3453
02:44:18,501 --> 02:44:22,070
lenses for optics.
They're comparing spotting scopes and

3454
02:44:22,071 --> 02:44:25,400
they started talking about walkie
talkies and they got it.

3455
02:44:25,630 --> 02:44:30,630
It became this combination of things
that guys love because god is love like

3456
02:44:32,270 --> 02:44:37,270
gadgets and tech things.
It became tech talk and and gadget talk

3457
02:44:38,900 --> 02:44:41,930
mixed with hunting and I,
I started thinking,

3458
02:44:41,931 --> 02:44:42,291
I'm like,
well,

3459
02:44:42,291 --> 02:44:44,420
when does this end?
Does it end with drones?

3460
02:44:44,660 --> 02:44:46,990
Does it not end?
Does it end with what?

3461
02:44:47,010 --> 02:44:48,470
I mean,
what if we come up with something

3462
02:44:48,830 --> 02:44:51,010
pharmacy appearing?
It's ending with drones.

3463
02:44:51,011 --> 02:44:52,580
Yeah,
it's ending with drones,

3464
02:44:52,760 --> 02:44:55,880
but it does if knowing.
Absolutely.

3465
02:44:55,881 --> 02:44:59,330
What's sending a drone up in the air,
it flies over.

3466
02:44:59,331 --> 02:45:00,800
Okay.
The herd of elk is,

3467
02:45:00,801 --> 02:45:02,720
you know,
a mile to the left.

3468
02:45:02,870 --> 02:45:05,180
We can't see him from here because
there's a ridge over us,

3469
02:45:05,390 --> 02:45:07,340
but we can.
We know where the wind is.

3470
02:45:07,341 --> 02:45:11,350
We can hook around this way and get
those animals that is in,

3471
02:45:11,630 --> 02:45:14,000
in your eyes,
that's cheating.

3472
02:45:14,110 --> 02:45:16,180
Well,
categorically at this point it's

3473
02:45:16,181 --> 02:45:17,770
illegal.
Is it illegal in every state,

3474
02:45:18,070 --> 02:45:22,240
but every state where every state,
the state were the states where it

3475
02:45:22,241 --> 02:45:27,241
matters because of having like open
country it is or is becoming and it's

3476
02:45:27,551 --> 02:45:28,810
not.
You're not going to be.

3477
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:31,600
It's not gonna happen.
I mean so many states out and for I

3478
02:45:31,601 --> 02:45:33,880
think 13 or 14 states have banned
drones,

3479
02:45:33,881 --> 02:45:35,230
but it's great that they got out in
front of.

3480
02:45:35,231 --> 02:45:37,100
It sort of came out of nowhere,
right?

3481
02:45:37,930 --> 02:45:39,820
Two way.
Communications is something where a lot

3482
02:45:39,821 --> 02:45:40,570
of,
uh,

3483
02:45:40,570 --> 02:45:42,190
you know,
some states,

3484
02:45:42,430 --> 02:45:45,310
and I'm not talking like liberal softy
states,

3485
02:45:45,311 --> 02:45:46,180
man,
Montana,

3486
02:45:46,181 --> 02:45:48,190
Alaska,
you can't use too many communications.

3487
02:45:48,191 --> 02:45:51,730
The hunt because they decided that
that's where you draw the line because

3488
02:45:52,660 --> 02:45:54,580
they might have even discussed and the
ethics thing,

3489
02:45:54,581 --> 02:45:57,560
but it's something that goes back to the
great conservationist and writer,

3490
02:45:57,561 --> 02:46:00,640
elder leopold,
where he had said we spend a lot of

3491
02:46:00,641 --> 02:46:04,120
energy improving the pump but not the
well,

3492
02:46:04,510 --> 02:46:07,150
so we have a resource,
you know,

3493
02:46:07,151 --> 02:46:11,180
we have,
we have a resource of wild animals and

3494
02:46:11,930 --> 02:46:16,930
if you just work on improving ways to,
to pump them out without also working on

3495
02:46:17,811 --> 02:46:21,980
ways of improving the well and having
there be a stable population,

3496
02:46:21,981 --> 02:46:23,720
um,
you're gonna drain the damn well.

3497
02:46:24,080 --> 02:46:27,860
So when we're looking at as emerging
technologies come out wrong,

3498
02:46:27,940 --> 02:46:29,750
you,
you have to constantly ask yourself,

3499
02:46:30,130 --> 02:46:33,650
um,
with increAsed efficacy,

3500
02:46:33,950 --> 02:46:38,000
like if we get it where technology,
it means that every hunter is always

3501
02:46:38,001 --> 02:46:40,520
successful.
What will that wind up meaning for

3502
02:46:40,521 --> 02:46:43,310
wildlife populations,
it's not going to mean a diminishment of

3503
02:46:43,311 --> 02:46:46,550
wildlife populations.
It will mean a tremendous diminishment

3504
02:46:46,551 --> 02:46:49,460
of hunter opportunity.
You have a lot,

3505
02:46:49,461 --> 02:46:51,530
like a lot of over the counter public
land.

3506
02:46:51,610 --> 02:46:56,000
Elkanns constantly.
American west are about 10 or 20 percent

3507
02:46:56,001 --> 02:46:59,360
success rates.
So you give out 100 licenses,

3508
02:46:59,750 --> 02:47:04,100
you're going to kill about 15 out.
This is a generalization,

3509
02:47:04,101 --> 02:47:06,590
but generally you give them a hundred
guys an opportunity.

3510
02:47:08,120 --> 02:47:10,040
If you have success rates at 100
percent,

3511
02:47:11,150 --> 02:47:12,770
how many tags are you given out?
15,

3512
02:47:13,430 --> 02:47:14,270
right?
Yeah.

3513
02:47:14,720 --> 02:47:16,990
So it's,
it's not,

3514
02:47:17,030 --> 02:47:22,030
it's like you're talking about ethics,
but you're also talking about access and

3515
02:47:22,341 --> 02:47:26,220
privilege but aren't for you personally,
aren't you also talking about the way it

3516
02:47:26,221 --> 02:47:27,050
makes you feel?

3517
02:47:27,050 --> 02:47:28,100
Yeah,
because.

3518
02:47:28,130 --> 02:47:29,330
Well,
I think it makes everybody feel that

3519
02:47:29,331 --> 02:47:31,280
way.
Guys that shoots up behind high fence,

3520
02:47:31,281 --> 02:47:32,990
they don't.
Defense has never in the picture.

3521
02:47:33,230 --> 02:47:35,870
And guys at radio hunt,
the goddamn radios are never in the

3522
02:47:35,871 --> 02:47:37,730
photographs.
Right,

3523
02:47:37,850 --> 02:47:39,920
right.
You see a guy standing there with 10

3524
02:47:39,921 --> 02:47:44,780
people in the photo and you know that
nine of them were up on glass and tits

3525
02:47:44,781 --> 02:47:48,470
with radios
radio and the guy in,

3526
02:47:48,620 --> 02:47:50,540
but they sure should,
aren't wearing the headsets and the

3527
02:47:50,541 --> 02:47:52,340
picture.
So they kind of get to that.

3528
02:47:52,341 --> 02:47:57,341
They're not proud of it.
Like I would like one way to to,

3529
02:47:58,180 --> 02:48:01,040
to look at things for me is I'm like,
you know,

3530
02:48:01,041 --> 02:48:03,710
is it something that you kind of tuck
away when it's all over?

3531
02:48:03,711 --> 02:48:05,390
Is this something that celebrated?
Yeah.

3532
02:48:05,590 --> 02:48:07,370
A guy killed south with the bowl.
That's some bitch.

3533
02:48:07,371 --> 02:48:09,740
And beau is laying on top of the animal
always.

3534
02:48:10,100 --> 02:48:11,270
Yeah,
that's true.

3535
02:48:12,180 --> 02:48:14,120
Yeah.
The guy with the gun maybe.

3536
02:48:14,121 --> 02:48:14,960
Maybe not.
Who knows?

3537
02:48:14,961 --> 02:48:16,220
He doesn't really care.
It doesn't matter.

3538
02:48:16,250 --> 02:48:16,761
Yeah.
He's like,

3539
02:48:16,761 --> 02:48:18,040
yeah,
maybe I might put my gun in there.

3540
02:48:18,050 --> 02:48:19,630
It might not.
That's not the point of.

3541
02:48:19,631 --> 02:48:22,310
Gary would never lays out a walkie
talkie on top of the bowl.

3542
02:48:22,550 --> 02:48:24,020
That's very.
It takes a photograph.

3543
02:48:24,021 --> 02:48:25,970
That's very true.
Very true.

3544
02:48:25,970 --> 02:48:26,940
That's it.
Alright.
