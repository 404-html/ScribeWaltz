1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,540
Hey everybody,
what's up man,

2
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,730
thanks for doing this.
I appreciate it.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,750
Oh,
it's an honor man.

4
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:20,530
There's so many people that I really
enjoy and respect have been contacting

5
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:23,020
me about having you on.
So when they found out that I was having

6
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:24,920
you on Michael Mouse,
everybody,

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,830
Ladies and gentlemen,
uh,

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:27,940
and when they were,
uh,

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,600
when I was saying that you were going to
be on,

10
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:31,090
when people heard about it,
they get super pumped.

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,800
So that's very,
very flattering.

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,910
Yeah.
And Dave Smith,

13
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:35,860
who I love,
very great friend of mine,

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,570
he's a great guy.
He was super psyched.

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,490
Oh yeah,
sure.

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,170
So welcome sir.
Thank you,

17
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:42,970
Mr. Again,
it's a good time for you to be here to

18
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:45,010
men.
It seems like we might be going to war

19
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,390
with North Korea,
so,

20
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:47,200
uh,
your book,

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,480
dear reader,
but I held it up.

22
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,280
Yeah,
it was probably an important book for

23
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:52,190
people that are like,
um,

24
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,130
what exactly is going on over there?

25
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:54,941
Well,
that's what I wrote it.

26
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:56,830
So that everything you read in the
press,

27
00:00:56,831 --> 00:00:58,000
this is crap.
Really.

28
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,320
Everything.
Pretty much.

29
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:00,190
Yeah.
What's,

30
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:01,150
uh,
what are they getting wrong?

31
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,110
They're getting wrong that uh,
so there was an article a couple of

32
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:06,880
years ago,
so the example I always used where you

33
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:09,730
had all these women marching in
Pyongyang,

34
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:13,810
the capital city and the headlines said,
Kim Juggling's mini skirted robot army,

35
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,920
and you know how,
how they are all,

36
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,420
they're all brainwashed and robots.
It's like they're all hostages.

37
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,790
If someone puts a gun to your mom's
head,

38
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,640
you're going to march.
If someone puts a gun to your head,

39
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:26,710
you're going to do it.
You need to do to get that kid food.

40
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,670
These are human beings who are in prison
and of course they do crazy silly

41
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:31,504
things,
wouldn't you?

42
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,040
Of course.
Yeah.

43
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,430
And the press is like,
ah.

44
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,760
It's also like they believe this silly
shit.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,910
You go to school and you're taught
something and if you don't believe it,

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,210
you go to a labor camp,
you're going to smile and fucking not.

47
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,020
But it's not a course.
You read the articles and it's just like

48
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,030
liquid.
These stupid people believe.

49
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:49,840
It's like,
yeah,

50
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,460
no.
You look at these hostages.

51
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:53,740
Believe yeah.
That's a better way of putting it for

52
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:55,000
sure.
Do you really think though,

53
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:57,430
that people aren't aware that some
people aren't aware of it,

54
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,020
of what?
Of,

55
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,080
of what a dictatorship,
a military dictatorship,

56
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:05,530
essentially.
I have it down to 45 seconds when I did

57
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:09,460
an interview with an NPR affiliate and
the woman said,

58
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:10,510
well,
Kim Jong Il,

59
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:12,310
so very campy figure.
And I said,

60
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:13,570
well,
that's uhm ill,

61
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,280
that's the one I wrote the book about
the Dad.

62
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,500
And she goes,
he's a very campy figure.

63
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:17,771
I go,
well,

64
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:20,740
that's a very unfortunate choice of
words and she wants to kill herself

65
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,510
because it's upon and concentration
camps,

66
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:24,820
you know,
so I mean if you look at like the

67
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:26,770
interview,
which got it right because they said

68
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,680
he's an evil killer,
but you look a team of America and they

69
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,210
look at him as this clown figure.

70
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,700
And I always say the joker from Batman
is a clown,

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,040
but you're not looking at all the bodies
behind him.

72
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,870
So yeah,
he's silly and a buffoon.

73
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:40,570
But this buffoon has millions of corpses
to his name.

74
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:43,900
And you think it's wacky that they're
marching in a parade?

75
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,410
Well yeah,
I mean for,

76
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,240
in team America's defense though,
that's what those guys do and that's

77
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,910
what they did with Saddam Hussein.
Remember they made them the gay lover to

78
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,650
Satan of course.
But I'm saying is I think a lot of

79
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:55,720
people in the.
I'm talking at the press specifically,

80
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:58,720
they take that they take a lot of North
Korea at face value.

81
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,040
So why I wrote the book is so like you
can understand what the hell's going on

82
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,050
there because it's all smoke and mirrors
with them.

83
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,380
Well it is one of the most public and
one of the most visible military

84
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:13,720
dictatorships and still still viable.

85
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,250
Yes.
In 2017,

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,290
which is really,
it's,

87
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,770
it's kind of shocking that mean when you
can walk down the street and Los Angeles

88
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:21,640
and you know,
go to,

89
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,670
you know,
go to starbucks and get a coffee and

90
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,170
everything's free and people,
you know,

91
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,360
there's billboards protesting this and
people talking about that.

92
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:32,950
And then there's this certain amount of
freedom that we just completely take for

93
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:33,701
granted.
We think,

94
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:36,790
well this is what life is like in 2017.
Sure.

95
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:40,480
It is in Los Angeles,
but in North Korea you might as well be

96
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:44,380
living a thousand years ago.
A actually what's funny is different

97
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:47,590
people are living at different times.
When I landed on the plane,

98
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,220
there was an army guy who stopped the
rich lady and he was like from the

99
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,650
fifties and she was from the eighties in
their clothes.

100
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,260
So they have different time periods
overlapping there.

101
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,890
So how's that?
Explain that.

102
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,880
Basically he's in fifties,
Russian gear,

103
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,130
like the soldier.
And he stopped shaving gear.

104
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,950
Yeah,
because they're their Soviet Soviet.

105
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,760
Right.
So they really were like Russia,

106
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,710
that Russia issue or a Russian style.
It's like green and they've got the

107
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,180
gold,
but it looks cheap.

108
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,260
You know what I mean?
That fabric,

109
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,630
it's it.
It doesn't look contemporary.

110
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,130
The cut,
I don't know what it is,

111
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:19,440
but something about the.
I just look at,

112
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,390
you're like,
this is communist era stuff and he stops

113
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,640
at the airport and it's obviously like
papers please.

114
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,360
And this was within 10 minutes of me
being in the capital and she rolls her

115
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:30,100
eyes at him,
which I was shocked.

116
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:32,560
And she goes and she's on her cell phone
and she's like,

117
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,800
and she digs through her purse,
shows him something and he nods and she

118
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:40,630
keeps going because what's happening now
is wealthy people in North Korea can run

119
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,550
the government and run their way around
the law,

120
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,510
which is great as long as they run a
foul of.

121
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,040
Correct.
Correct.

122
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,840
But in which case they just get killed.
It depending.

123
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,850
But yeah.
So when you're in power,

124
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,850
like the laws don't apply to you.
It's not that everyone's scared the

125
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:55,690
cops.
It's when you're,

126
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,180
when you're rich,
you can have a huge black market.

127
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:02,830
You can bribe your way out of anything.
So how do people get rich in a communist

128
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:05,920
dictatorship.
So what happened in the nineties when

129
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,740
Kim Jong Il chose to have a famine and
chose to have millions of people starve

130
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,320
rather than lose his hold on power.
They started looking the other way and

131
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:17,890
all these little markets that popped up,
blue black markets because the

132
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,390
government wasn't providing food
anymore.

133
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,420
So people would go to China and trade
stuff and come back and you know,

134
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:26,620
they'd get rice and so on and so forth.
So these markets are now the backbone in

135
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:30,550
many ways of the North Korean economy
and yet the cops can come and hassle

136
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:32,200
you,
but you got to bribe that cop.

137
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,210
But it just basically works out to
attacks.

138
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,400
Wow.
So these people are essentially running

139
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:43,120
black markets inside of this communist
dictatorship and just paying off the

140
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:45,340
cops so they can keep all this going.
It's public,

141
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,000
it's in the town square,
but it's not.

142
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,930
They don't regard themselves as
communist anymore and it's not.

143
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,500
It's much closer.
Many ways to fascism then to Hitler

144
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,180
style,
fascism and communism.

145
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,940
So the,
are they putting their money in a North

146
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,350
Korean bank?
Well that's the trick.

147
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:04,220
So they used to have like the money
stuffed in mattresses and then North

148
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,050
Korea said,
we're switching currency tomorrow.

149
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,850
You got to switch it out there.
Forty eight hours.

150
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:11,150
And everyone started going broke.
So the government figures out what the

151
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:13,310
people do.
Here's something else that goes and

152
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,710
fucks him over every step of the way.
Here's something else that used to

153
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:19,070
happen.
It used to be if you go to China,

154
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,490
right to escape,
you just bribe the border guard because

155
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:25,340
he's hungry and then you go to China and
do what you need to do and you come

156
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:25,790
back,
right.

157
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,470
Let's suppose you're trading and he gets
a cut now they changed it to he can keep

158
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:34,460
the bribe as long as he arrest you.
So He lets you go and then he comes

159
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,110
back,
he takes all your shit and he keeps his

160
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,150
money and you get in trouble.
Oh Wow.

161
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:42,020
So they're very smart.
So they did that to discourage bribes

162
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:43,940
and encourage a wrestle.
Right.

163
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:47,090
To keep their control.
And do the North Koreans know this now

164
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:49,490
they stopped trying to bribe these guys.
Look after a few of them,

165
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:51,680
but I'm rusting.
Well it keeps kind of changing and then

166
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:53,420
it's all this.
You never know ahead of time.

167
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:55,370
It's like a drug deal.
Is this guy cool?

168
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,430
Is this guy not cool?
And that's what so much of it is like

169
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,580
know talking between the lines and,
and working with people.

170
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:05,050
And who do you know and who's close and
it's all these slight of hand kind of

171
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,780
things.

172
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,640
It's just when you see something like
what they're doing is in terms of what

173
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,310
the way the government is running the
country.

174
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:14,910
It's when you watch it on television,
you.

175
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,800
My feeling is how long can they keep
this up forever,

176
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,580
you think?
Well,

177
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,010
no,
not for much longer than they should

178
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:24,080
have because here's what happened in the
nineties.

179
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,740
The famine hit right?
And I can explain why I get into my

180
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:31,970
book.
The UN came to give them food and Kim

181
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,550
Jong Il said,
well if the UN is giving people food,

182
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:37,430
they're not gonna need the government.
So what they would do is people in the

183
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:39,230
UN,
we're not allowed to have any Korean

184
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:43,280
speakers on staff.
So they went to village a on Monday and

185
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:47,330
they saw healthy people and they went to
village be on Tuesday and then Wednesday

186
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:49,250
they went back to the first village and
the Koreans are like,

187
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:50,240
oh,
this is a third village.

188
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,290
They go,
we were just hearing Monday.

189
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:51,681
And they go,
no,

190
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,150
you weren't.
And it's like,

191
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:55,280
what are you going to tell them?
And eventually the UN left.

192
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,040
They're like,
fuck this,

193
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,120
we can't help these people.
So they were willing to let the

194
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:02,000
population on.
So the first village was pretending to

195
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:03,150
be a new village?
No,

196
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,510
the right,
correct.

197
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,740
Not even pretending it's just obviously
the same village,

198
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:09,140
but they're lying to their site where
they saying that they were a different

199
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:11,570
village because that way they're saying
we showed you three towns and

200
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,660
everything's fine.
So it was basically they just put people

201
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,600
there to act and behind the story.
Did you ever see the vice piece when

202
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:21,020
Shane Smith went to North Korea and they
pretended to have a restaurant?

203
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,360
No.
So he got that wrong in my opinion.

204
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,170
So what the senior talking about is he's
in the hotel and I,

205
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,730
I think I stayed in the same room as him
and that hotel,

206
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,480
it's nicknamed the Alcatraz of fun
because it's on an island in the middle

207
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:33,860
of the river,
in the middle of young gang.

208
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,070
So they took them to this ballroom and
they are,

209
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,930
you know,
distributing food to all these tables.

210
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:41,090
But no one's there,
and he asked the waitress,

211
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:42,140
he goes,
whereas everyone,

212
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:45,500
and she goes,
they just left what I perceived that to

213
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:46,790
be and I don't,
I'm not inside her head.

214
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,440
Of course,
in North Korea,

215
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,700
I,
when I was there,

216
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:51,260
I'm like,
I got to figure out what the rules are

217
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:53,930
because I was born in the Soviet Union.
You had these little rules to figure out

218
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:56,520
what works and what does it.
And what it was is you can never

219
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:58,530
acknowledge anything's wrong because if
you do,

220
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:01,170
that's complaining and complaining,
criticizing the government.

221
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,050
So if he,
if she had said this,

222
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:06,990
food's all wasted.
She's making complaint.

223
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:09,450
Right?
But if she is doing improv and she's

224
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:10,500
like,
everything's fine,

225
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,050
then the best you can to come up with is
everyone just left this.

226
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,260
Everything's so.
You have to maintain disappearance that

227
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:19,050
everything's good all the time.
His perception was,

228
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,670
and she's on camera.
Keep that in mind.

229
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,360
Does she know what she's on camera for?
It doesn't.

230
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,370
It doesn't matter if you're a hostage on
camera,

231
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:30,540
you're going to smile and nod.
Aren't the worst one was Laura Ling,

232
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,580
uh,
she was interviewing this family in the

233
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:35,670
capital city and she goes,
can Kim Jong Il do anything wrong?

234
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,460
And they pretended that they didn't
understand her and she,

235
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,510
and she's like,
I'm like,

236
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,850
wait a minute,
you're asking a family on camera to

237
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:44,470
criticize the government,
are you and are you insane?

238
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,500
Yeah.
What is wrong with you woman?

239
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,180
And it's the wrong way to do it.
Yeah.

240
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,850
Shane's perception was that they had set
this place up as a restaurant and it

241
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:56,760
wasn't really a restaurant because they
don't really have restaurants per se,

242
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:02,090
and that they were trying to pretend and
put on this air like they were a normal

243
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,430
society and you can just go to the
restaurant and bar some food.

244
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,940
But when he went in there,
he said the whole thing was clearly set

245
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,920
up just for them.
That's I,

246
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,610
I didn't go to that restaurant he went
to.

247
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:13,620
So I can't speak on that.
They do.

248
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,620
And I went later than him.
They do have restaurants for sure in

249
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:17,730
Pyongyang.
We went to several.

250
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:19,480
They're crappy.
Um,

251
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,070
but a lot of the stuff that is for show,
it's pretty easy to tell what's for

252
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,470
showing what isn't.
So if he's saying that this whole thing

253
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:27,120
was a setup just for him,
that's plausible.

254
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,890
Yeah,
that was what he was thinking.

255
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,640
He was thinking that they were putting
on like a big pr display for him because

256
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:35,070
when I went,
when you go to the maternity hospital,

257
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,980
a lot of that stuff is clearly for show
because there's computers but they're

258
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:40,110
not even plugged in maternity hospitals.
Yeah.

259
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,820
They're very proud of their maternity
hospital,

260
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,160
maternity,
paternity to where you have kids.

261
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,710
What's a maternity?
Sorry.

262
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,400
I think Russia now.
So they have computers that aren't even

263
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:51,234
plugged in.
Right.

264
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,730
Why do they.
So what's,

265
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,150
what's fake about it?
Like the computers are for display

266
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,260
purposes only.
So it's like,

267
00:10:58,261 --> 00:10:59,071
oh,
we go online,

268
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:01,950
we are advanced,
we have science and you know,

269
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:04,020
you go into a lab and someone's at a
microscope,

270
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,360
you know,
cutting edge technology,

271
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,050
they don't look up.
It's like listen,

272
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:09,480
if you're working at a microscope and 20
people walk in the room,

273
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:10,950
you're just going to glance stuff
instinctively.

274
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,780
So everyone essentially as a hostage
from even from the police down to the

275
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:18,540
doctors to including the leaders
themselves.

276
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,800
So when these countries liberalized like
Libya and Iraq,

277
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,820
the leaders themselves are killed.
So even if Kim Jong going wanted things

278
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:29,370
to loosen up,
he's going to get a bullet in him and

279
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:32,850
with good reason.
So it's a system where everyone is a

280
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:33,270
prisoner.

281
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:38,040
Kim Jong Il became a big missed because
he married a woman in secret and then

282
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,060
his dad,
the great leader,

283
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:41,310
Kim Il Sung was like,
when are you going to get married?

284
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:42,420
He's like,
student Dad soon.

285
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:44,190
And then his dad's like,
I found a wife for you.

286
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,270
And he's like,
okay.

287
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,110
So he married a second woman and kept
his first emily and hidden compound.

288
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,210
And that was,
that was that first son who was just

289
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,740
recently killed.
Wow.

290
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:57,280
And this was the son that was killed by
Kim Jong Aoun because they thought that

291
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,530
they were trying to organize a coup
against him.

292
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,240
Well,
it's not even if they're trying.

293
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:05,620
So North Korea has a constitution,
which is for display purposes only,

294
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:09,460
but what really governs the country is
the 10 commandments of Kim Il Sung.

295
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,370
And the 10th commandment is,
I forget what it is,

296
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:14,350
something there.
It's the revolution shall be continued

297
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:16,030
through the generations until it's
completed.

298
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,720
Which means only a descendant of Kim Il
Sung can be the leader.

299
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,270
So Kim Jong,
Il had three sons.

300
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,000
The middle one is a sissy,
so he doesn't count.

301
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,110
He's assisted.
Yeah,

302
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,590
they said he's too much like a girl,
like that's all we know about him.

303
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:32,740
And he's a big Eric Clapton for certain
pit all like this guy,

304
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,640
pictures of this guy.
There's some online.

305
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:37,580
You sit in their shoes.
Off they left.

306
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,430
So the eldest son was Kim Jong Nam and
the youngest was Kim Jong,

307
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:46,210
Il and Kim Jong Nam wanted to liberalize
Kim Jong.

308
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:48,370
Il Said No.
So if Kim Jong UN is going to be

309
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:50,830
replaced,
the only one who could have replaced him

310
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,040
was his older brother Kim Jong Nam.
So if he's killed,

311
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,670
that's an insurance policy.
Oh.

312
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,100
So he killed him just to make sure that
he wasn't overthrown.

313
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,310
Yeah,
and he killed his sons to right now he

314
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:04,310
killed his,
his,

315
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,130
his aunt's husband.

316
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,970
Oh Jesus.
But she drove his,

317
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,900
her daughter to suicide.
So there are,

318
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,150
it's game of thrones in humans.
Six,

319
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:14,140
six,
six stuff.

320
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,530
And they boast about.
I mean when I was doing my research for

321
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,730
the book,
they don't,

322
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,170
they boast about all the shit they do,
like North Korea was recently criticized

323
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:28,150
by the UN for having concentration camps
and they literally said we don't use

324
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:31,240
that term so we don't have any.
That was their response.

325
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,640
What are you going to do about it?
Well,

326
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,820
they've got a point.
Yeah.

327
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,610
Case case claims.
If they don't use the point,

328
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,560
they don't use that term.
There you go.

329
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,970
Something different.
Yeah.

330
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,280
So there,
there's so many layers of hell in this

331
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,510
country that it,
it,

332
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,600
you know,
why I like speaking about it is

333
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,230
someone's got to do it and people don't
know what's going on and it's,

334
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:52,150
it kinda bothers me.

335
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,070
You know,
when you hear people on TV trying to

336
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:56,470
give their opinion and they don't know
the actual data,

337
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:58,740
it's so much worse than people think.
Yeah,

338
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:02,080
there's,
well we have a very peripheral knowledge

339
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:04,510
of it,
like in terms of like what's put out on

340
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,790
mainstream media.
We know that it's bad,

341
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,880
but we know that it's a dictatorship.
We know that the people are under the

342
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,140
iron thumb.
Right.

343
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,760
But we don't know too much more.
Right?

344
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,390
Right.
So I had to do all the homework and now

345
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:18,310
you can read this book and now you have
everything you need to know.

346
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,370
And when you went over there,
what,

347
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,600
what year did you go over there?
In 2012.

348
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,430
So Kim John took over in 2011.
Eleven.

349
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,050
So he had already taken over.
Correct.

350
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,730
So what was it?
What was the.

351
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,460
This was like post all the crying and
the streets.

352
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,640
Oh yeah,
the craziness.

353
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,280
Oh yeah.
Did you want to be there for that?

354
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:40,480
That must've been fascinating to watch
that there's nothing in North Korea

355
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:42,940
that's not fascinating because when
you're going through the city,

356
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,140
you know,
in the countryside,

357
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:46,420
everything's there for a reason and
you're looking around,

358
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:47,740
you're like,
why did they make this like this?

359
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:49,660
And you're not going to have an answer
because everything is constructed,

360
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:53,030
you know what I mean?
So you're trying to find analogs between

361
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,310
what's,
what you know to be saying and what they

362
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,420
have.
And sometimes it's not obvious I was,

363
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,460
they showed us,
they took us to this place and they

364
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:05,270
claim that there's an invisible wall
that we built that separates the Koreas

365
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,890
right.
And you can only see the wall from the

366
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:10,010
north and this is to keep the Koreas
divided permanently.

367
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,790
I got the brochure and they,
the you,

368
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,340
your little telescope and you're like,
what am I looking at?

369
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,160
Is this a wall?
This is the path isn't mountainside.

370
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,740
And there was a praying mantis there.
And I told my guide,

371
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:19,760
I go,
Yo,

372
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:22,190
I thought this was a communist country.
And atheist country wise,

373
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:23,630
they're praying Mantis,
ha ha.

374
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,980
And she's like,
I have no idea.

375
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:26,480
We're talking about.
And then I'm like,

376
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:27,110
okay,
well,

377
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,640
I mean they're not going to call a
praying mantis.

378
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:30,620
They must have a different word.
So I said,

379
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:32,630
well,
this reminds me of my favorite fable,

380
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,220
the Fox in the Scorpion,
you know,

381
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:36,260
the Fox and Scorpion one across the
river.

382
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,860
I thought it was a frog.
It's,

383
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,840
it's either,
right?

384
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:41,330
So we could do frog and score for foxes
can swim.

385
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,330
That's where the frogs can swim.
Two Scorpion.

386
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,463
Yeah.
Yeah.

387
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,950
So
far.

388
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,350
So the frog says,
uh,

389
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,420
the Scorpion says,
let me hop on your back so I can cross

390
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:54,380
the river.
And the frog goes,

391
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:56,540
had I know you won't sting me.
And Scorpion goes,

392
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,640
if I stinky,
we both drowned and halfway through the

393
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:00,980
Scorpion stings him and says,
the frog goes,

394
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,230
why'd you Stingley road dying?
And the Scorpion goes,

395
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:05,810
that's my nature.
And I told this to my God and she's

396
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:06,710
like,
what's a scorpion?

397
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:07,940
I'm like,
okay.

398
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,590
So I'm like,
it's like the lobster that lives in the

399
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:10,460
desert,
she has no idea.

400
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:11,300
I'm like,
I draw it.

401
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,130
She'd never heard of it.
And you think how many times you've

402
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:17,690
heard of a scorpion from comic books,
from nature shows,

403
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,330
from nature books,
you know,

404
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,860
just logos,
the horoscope,

405
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,240
and it's like holy shit,
like her level of what is known is so

406
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:29,720
limited that even something as basic as
that is completely foreign to her

407
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,910
because they don't have scorpions in
North Korea,

408
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:32,900
so you don't need to know about it.

409
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,130
It's just,
it's so fascinating that in the same

410
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:42,131
time period as the internet and Google,
Uber Satellites,

411
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,930
Ilan mosque,
all the crazy shit that we're

412
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:48,410
experiencing that these people are
essentially completely isolated.

413
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,090
Yeah.
Other than what,

414
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,890
how many websites is like 18 websites or
something like that?

415
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,240
Very low on their North Korean internet.
Intranet.

416
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,470
Yeah.
Intranet.

417
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:57,950
Yeah,
right.

418
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,950
Which for folks like intranet is what
corporations and companies use to share

419
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,260
in internal knowledge.
And so they have a system set up like

420
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:10,100
that and so these people that want to go
quote unquote online,

421
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,710
that's what they're going to get.
They're getting only very few people are

422
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:15,080
going to have that access also.
It's amazing.

423
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,580
Yeah.
I mean it's terrifying.

424
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:19,610
It's horrifying and it doesn't seem like
it has a solution,

425
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,730
but it's also amazing and it doesn't
have to be this way.

426
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,320
Well,
what could be done?

427
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,810
I just mean this is being done
intentionally.

428
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,380
Oh,
for sure.

429
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,540
And,
and this is being done methodically.

430
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,320
So when I was doing the research,
it's like,

431
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,280
uh,
the Russian writer,

432
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:35,870
Iran said something like,
um,

433
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,120
heirs of this magnitude I'd never made
innocently.

434
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,060
So this was a step by step process from
the great leader,

435
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,100
Kim Il Sung and the director Kim Jong
Il,

436
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:48,050
to slowly close the walls and these
people and to keep it as airtight and as

437
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,360
much like a prison as possible.
It was a very step by step by step over

438
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,590
the decades.
And you,

439
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,241
and you know,
as,

440
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:56,940
as you read the history,
you could just feel the walls closing

441
00:17:56,941 --> 00:18:00,510
in.
But we were talking recently about the

442
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:02,790
wailing and the streets when Kim Jong Il
died.

443
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,620
And about how people who did not,
they didn't cry hard enough,

444
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,940
were sentenced to six months of hard
labor.

445
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:11,280
Right?
So what they have there is,

446
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,750
you know,
people again,

447
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:14,130
when you think it's just the
dictatorship,

448
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,460
so everyone in North Korea is slotted
into some group,

449
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,530
like your school,
your workplace,

450
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,240
maybe the young workers,
women's,

451
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:22,020
whatever.

452
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,610
Once a week your whole group has to get
together and you have to stand up and

453
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:30,600
say what you did wrong and then your
other friends have to get up and

454
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:33,810
denounce you and say what they saw you
doing wrong and they better have

455
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:34,980
something to say.
Right.

456
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,860
So everyone is watching each other all
the time.

457
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,990
So it's almost like Aa,
right,

458
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,140
like from hell.
So this has been going on since the

459
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,160
seventies.
So people are like,

460
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:45,480
why don't they just get together and
revolt?

461
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,290
You can't revolt when everyone around
you is looking to make sure they have

462
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,120
something to tell about you at your
weekly meeting.

463
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,370
It's really kind of brilliant.
It is.

464
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:54,840
Absolutely.
That's the thing when people like these

465
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:56,580
people are crazy and stupid,
like this is brilliant.

466
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,700
They have it all worked out and it's
working for them.

467
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,730
Well it's,
it's a conspiracy at the highest level.

468
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,820
Yes.
I mean really is the entire country is a

469
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,530
massive conspiracy.
Yes.

470
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,910
Fucking stunning.
Really,

471
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,090
when you really look at it that way,
that this is how many million people?

472
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,280
A 24 million.
Fucking incredible.

473
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

474
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,400
And that they've been put in.
Everyone's like,

475
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:19,740
they're suicidal,
they've outlasted everybody except for

476
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,570
Cuba.
Then the last one standing and they

477
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,370
gloat about it and they should be
gloating about it.

478
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,790
It's essentially Los Angeles,
but prison,

479
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,720
it's not.
Los Angeles was a prison but larger than

480
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:31,470
Los Angeles.
Well,

481
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,990
you guys have warm weather.
They have cold weather and they don't

482
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:36,420
have warm clothes and the population,
so yeah,

483
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:37,254
yeah,
yeah.

484
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,890
Oh yeah.
Even just the population size of Los

485
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,030
Angeles and yet everyone's a prisoner.
Everyone's a prison.

486
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,610
Yeah.
Fucking incredible.

487
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,810
So I just want people to keep that in
mind next time they are laughing at one

488
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:51,930
of these articles or like how stupid
these people are.

489
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,690
It's like you are going to believe
whatever you need to believe in prison.

490
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,660
Well people don't really look into it.
I mean when you see these goofy fucking

491
00:19:57,661 --> 00:19:58,470
haircut,
right.

492
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,490
You know,
and then you know,

493
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,910
there was some sketch recently where he
made everybody get the same haircut.

494
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,270
That's a myth.
It was a sketch comedy sketch,

495
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,860
but it was just there.
It was like,

496
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:08,341
ah,
yeah,

497
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,580
this is a stupid aircraft.
Whoa.

498
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,490
Oh,
what's Britney spears up to her?

499
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:14,560
Just going crazy with Jennifer Lopez.
Grow toward.

500
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,930
Were those Kim Kim corridor ocean.
It was a girls and we just move on to

501
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:22,230
the next ridiculous thing and the reason
he has that haircut is because that's

502
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:25,200
the haircut that great leader his
grandfather had in the forties.

503
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,780
So He's like,
I'm my grant.

504
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,770
When Kim Jong Il took over in 1994,
his campaign slogan was,

505
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,970
do not expect any change for me.
That was literally on the billboards.

506
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,320
I am the same person as my dad was who
got in trouble recently for having a

507
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:43,980
Hitler haircut.
There was a story recently,

508
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,130
someone in Europe,
some kid in Europe was kicked

509
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,440
out of something for essentially having
a Hitler haircut,

510
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:52,540
which is like today,
my friend Moshe,

511
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,750
Moshe Kasher has a Hitler haircut and
he's just a hipster.

512
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,820
Hitler youth had that couple of years
ago.

513
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,690
It's like shaved on the sides and I kind
of have a little bit.

514
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,580
I mean if you lift the top,
grow a little bit more.

515
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:05,590
Yeah.
But I mean that's a,

516
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,520
that's kind of like what he's rocking.
He's rocking this retro haircut.

517
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

518
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,120
And with good reason and we think it's
silly.

519
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,610
You know,
we,

520
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,880
we just hee,
he ha ha.

521
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,350
Right.
But meanwhile we're watching this mass

522
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:18,760
atrocity go on.
Yes.

523
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,490
Yeah.
And it's funny for me because every time

524
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,010
I talk about it,
everyone I met is still there.

525
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,290
Like everyone I saw on the street,
it's still there.

526
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,080
Every little kid I saw still there,
my guide is still there.

527
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,680
Uh,
who was a very sweet young lady and it

528
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,360
was heartbreaking and I hate being one
of those people who like,

529
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,740
oh,
I went on this trip and it changed my

530
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:36,201
life,
you know,

531
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:37,240
like the whole facebook shit.

532
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,740
But it fucks with your head for years
because of being Jewish,

533
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,320
being born in the Soviet Union.
Those were,

534
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,790
this is why I took on this project.
Those are chances for me to have been in

535
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:46,391
a camp,
you know,

536
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:48,400
back in the day for sure.
So to see.

537
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,740
My friend is also from Russia.
He goes,

538
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:53,890
it looks like Russian people,
the architecture and the clothes,

539
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:55,480
but it's just Asian people in them.
He's like,

540
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,470
it's a total mind.
Fuck.

541
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,660
Well,
it's also fascinating when you consider

542
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:03,040
the small amount of time between the
concentration camps or the Holocaust and

543
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,960
today,
I mean we look,

544
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,150
I'm almost 50.
I turned 50 in August,

545
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:12,390
which when I was a child seemed like an
eternity and now as a man is almost 50.

546
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,380
It seems like a just happened.
Well,

547
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:14,980
the rush.
Yeah,

548
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,400
yeah,
yeah.

549
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,680
Which is 50 years ago,
you know,

550
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:19,510
we're,
we're just out of the Holocaust,

551
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:21,550
but 50 years ago we're just into the
Vietnam war.

552
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,180
Right,
right.

553
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,560
I mean,
it's so quick.

554
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,770
It's so recent.
I mean,

555
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,780
what we think of as modern,
we think of as like modern civilization.

556
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,210
It's only modern civilization and a
couple of spots.

557
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,610
Right?
And this was the attitude right before

558
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:37,640
World War One,
remember,

559
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,010
they're like,
we're civilized now.

560
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,280
There's never going to be wars again.
We've got all figured out and then World

561
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,530
War One happens and they're like,
what the fuck just happened when I was a

562
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,360
boy I was living in San Francisco and
um,

563
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,550
it was all like we were right off of
Lombard street is where we lived,

564
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:54,320
was a really crooked street.
And um,

565
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,290
I remember when the Vietnam War ended,
I remember because I remember thinking,

566
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,190
I don't want to go to war.
I'm glad they figured this out was a

567
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:04,150
little kid.
I was like,

568
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:05,620
good,
we're done with war.

569
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,290
Thank God.
And then when I was,

570
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:13,291
I think I was 21 or 22 thing,
I was 21 when the Gulf War broke out and

571
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:16,150
I was sitting there with my friend
Jimmy,

572
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,720
my roommate at the time,
we're sitting in our apartment watching

573
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:23,140
the missiles.
They showed that night vision scene of

574
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:25,510
the missiles flying and he was like,
Holy Shit Buddy,

575
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:27,040
we're at fucking war.
And I was like,

576
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,380
this is crazy.
I thought we were done with this.

577
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,750
Oh yeah,
and you mean the second Iraq war?

578
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,810
The first one.
Okay.

579
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,640
Desert Storm.
That was what it was at 89,

580
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,493
eight,
99,

581
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,150
somewhere around that and so I was 2198.
[inaudible] 90?

582
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:40,984
Yes.
Okay.

583
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,380
Stunning.
To me at the time because I was like,

584
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,650
how is this possible?
This is.

585
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,100
We're still

586
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,780
doing this.
I thought we were done.

587
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,990
I thought we were finished with Vietnam.
I thought we realized like as a culture,

588
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,880
like hey,
this is something we need to evolve

589
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:54,890
past,
but it's just so recent.

590
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,880
There's so much pro war propaganda.
Like on the one hand you'll hear how bad

591
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:03,140
war is and then you'll hear the
glorification of FDR and Woodrow Wilson

592
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,790
and like if you look at the end of the
Cold War,

593
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,430
Reagan Thatcher and Gorbachev,
they ended it without a shot.

594
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:11,390
They fried half the world from this
communist dictatorship and that's almost

595
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:13,580
like an asterisk and it's like that's
the way to do it.

596
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,510
Like if you want to end a war,
do it peacefully and without the body

597
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:19,520
count.
I want to avoid the body count.

598
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:22,340
I don't want the funerals.
I don't want the destroyed buildings and

599
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:24,160
people just on some level of revel in
that.

600
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,740
Both in the right and the left.
Well,

601
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,330
one thing that's undisputable is that if
you look back a long enough,

602
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:33,860
we are clearly evolving.
Human beings are across the board pretty

603
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:36,080
much except for places like North Korea,
like Steven Pinker,

604
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,130
yes.
Yeah.

605
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,420
Perfect example.
What he's talking about is if you go

606
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,720
what anybody's talking about,
if you go back a thousand years ago and

607
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:48,740
you look at today with it's inarguable
that this is a far safer place to live.

608
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,210
Yes.
Far more inclusive.

609
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,980
People are far more understanding,
compassionate and far more willing to be

610
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:57,260
open to strangers.
It's a different world,

611
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,980
but like how does anyone get past this?
This is the thing that freaks me out

612
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:05,750
when it comes to something like North
Korea.

613
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,460
It's like when you have this absolute
power at the top,

614
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,700
like Libya,
like when Walmart Kadafi was killed and

615
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:17,360
then you get rid of that,
you have this fucking chaos.

616
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,210
Right?
And how does that ever help those people

617
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:22,460
that lived there?
It's almost like those people that live

618
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:23,960
there,
those 20 plus million people that live

619
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:26,780
in North Korea,
it's almost like they can't be fixed.

620
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,290
Like,
Oh,

621
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,300
you're wrong.
That's not what I meant.

622
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,020
I didn't mean like it's impossible,
but I mean it's like they're so

623
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:37,160
programmed to living in this environment
and they're so under the grip of this

624
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:37,820
guy.
Right?

625
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,580
If you take that guy out,
don't you think there'll be some kind of

626
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:43,430
a massive power vacuum that some will
try to fill a.

627
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,230
yes.
That's one concern.

628
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:47,510
However,
like I've met refugees and they're the

629
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:50,120
most annoying,
boring teenagers you'd ever hope to

630
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:53,660
meet,
which is great because I want my goal is

631
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:55,640
that a wish.
I want these people to be sitting on

632
00:25:55,641 --> 00:26:00,641
lazy boys with their bucket of Kimchi
and the pounder and watching two pounder

633
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,520
like a,
like a beer.

634
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,300
The telomere,
right?

635
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,470
Oh,
and just watching tv like everybody,

636
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,740
everyone else,
like they have the right to just be lazy

637
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:08,720
assholes.
Like that's all I want for these people

638
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,960
and a lot of times they are very.
They get acclimated pretty easily.

639
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:17,300
It's a big surprise.
Individuals,

640
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,550
if they leave that environment,
what I'm talking about is the

641
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:22,550
environment itself.
It's going to be extremely tough

642
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:27,500
transition because it's been 70 years of
dictatorship and abuse in isolation,

643
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,530
you know,
when you have a country that's

644
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,260
programmed in that way that essentially
has been programmed from birth and I was

645
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:37,160
reading an article about a kid that was
born in a prison camp escape from camp

646
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:38,120
14.
Yes,

647
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:40,190
yes.
Which is horrific,

648
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:42,450
right?
I mean that is a horrific account of

649
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:44,040
like the different stages

650
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,400
of physical depletion that the prisoners
would be like.

651
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:50,010
So like if you're at this stage,
you can be assigned to physical labor

652
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:52,230
and you get to this point,
you can't do physical labor anymore and

653
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,500
he's drawing pictures of what these
people look like and if you kill

654
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:57,720
yourself,
your family has to fulfill your quota.

655
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,800
So even death is not an escape from the
North Korean regime is.

656
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,320
It's a fucking stunning.
So what happens?

657
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,440
I mean,
how is there even a conceivable plan?

658
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,080
The only way.
So first of all,

659
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,800
China doesn't want 24 million people who
don't speak Chinese,

660
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,170
who have no skills whatsoever crossing
the two men and Yellow River's

661
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,050
intervention area and setting up camp
there.

662
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,980
That's their concern.
However they started backing down and

663
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:26,380
that's the greatest possible thing.
So what would happen is household

664
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,200
backing down,
meaning they started standing up to

665
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:29,034
North Korea.
They've,

666
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,050
they were like refusing to exports.

667
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,750
They sat down with trump and clearly
talked about North Korea.

668
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,740
There's no way trump is running his
mouth without having a plan with them.

669
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,740
I'm sure that's the case.
They were very friendly with Mara Lago.

670
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,590
Um,
so golf.

671
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,270
What's that?
They like golf and hookers don't like

672
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:46,980
golf somebody because that's the whole
thing.

673
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:49,170
It's capitalist now had this whole thing
against golf.

674
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,790
This was a big controversy.
Yes,

675
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,450
it's,
it's the,

676
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,580
it's the sport of millionaires.
A,

677
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:54,390
I say.
Yeah,

678
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,030
but isn't China like a totally different
environment now we're getting off track

679
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:59,340
though.
I don't want continue less joking

680
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:01,470
around,
but the point is once that government is

681
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,600
somehow vanished and I have no idea how
that would happen,

682
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,940
you would have to have China,
Russia,

683
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,960
South Korea and Japan and us working
together to kind of have a Marshall Plan

684
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:11,940
of some kind.
That's the only way that's going to

685
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:12,330
happen.

686
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,750
And even in a Marshall Plan.
Well,

687
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:17,850
how do you deal with all those people
and give them meaningful employment and

688
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:22,851
give them some sort of a new philosophy
or a new culture or new.

689
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,120
Some sort of government.
I don't think it would be that hard

690
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,160
really.
I really don't because it's not.

691
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,210
There's not like there's agent like
this,

692
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,490
the Muslim Brotherhood,
whatever.

693
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,280
These are people who want food,
clothes,

694
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,740
a roof over their heads and
opportunities for their kids.

695
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:42,270
South Korea who's the same people has
the highest per capita income of any

696
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:43,800
country in Asia,
which is saying a lot,

697
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,160
so it would just be.
It would not be easy and it would be a

698
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:51,240
long process,
but I don't think it would be as much of

699
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:54,060
a shit show as like Libya or Syria or
any of these other places.

700
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,480
That's interesting.
Why do you think it'd be easier?

701
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,610
Because I think once they find out how
much they've been lied to and now they

702
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,860
have like,
look it just go to this office work nine

703
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:05,510
to five gifts.

704
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,380
They're very hard working because their
slaves.

705
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,390
Right?
So they don't sound like they don't have

706
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:11,310
a work ethic.
It's not like they're not ambitious,

707
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:14,250
it's just like they're ambitious gonna
get them nowhere and frankly the ones

708
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:17,610
who were the most loyal to the regime
were the ones who starved in the

709
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:19,200
nineties because they thought food's
coming,

710
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:20,250
food's coming,
food's coming,

711
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,860
and the ones who are shady and who were
like,

712
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,050
I'm going to get fed by any means
necessary.

713
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:27,420
Who are entrepreneurial?
They're the ones who survived.

714
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,590
When you left that place and you got
back home and you're sitting there and

715
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:35,550
you're about to put this book together
and you're thinking about this world

716
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,260
that you just escaped from.
Yeah.

717
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,330
What do you.
How does this play out?

718
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:39,960
Do you,
did you,

719
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,890
did you think like where this goes?
Did you like look at what you saw and

720
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,280
come up with some possible scenarios for
how this eventually plays out?

721
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,210
Well,
I had one quote from either having their

722
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:55,780
Steinbeck and the quote was,
how did you go bankrupt two ways

723
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,440
gradually and then suddenly,
so it's going to happen overnight.

724
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,450
We're not going to see it coming.
Uh,

725
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:04,810
I don't.
I think all those countries around North

726
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,670
Korea,
I've agreed it's a problem.

727
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,280
All those country like this is a fucking
nightmare.

728
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:11,380
And I think just like with the first
world war,

729
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:13,720
Gulf War,
they would very quickly get together and

730
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:14,111
be like,
all right,

731
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:16,180
we can't have this exploding some
nightmare.

732
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,400
Let's work together and figure this shit
out.

733
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:19,870
I think it'd be a very,
very,

734
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,150
uh,
difficult but not difficult.

735
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:25,390
Ideological audiologically a plan to
come forward.

736
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,360
It's so fascinating when you compare
them to South Korea,

737
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:32,350
which is thriving economy.
He makes some of the best electronics in

738
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:35,710
the world or the best phones and
televisions and you know,

739
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:39,640
and it's just amazing that they're right
next door to each other and there's such

740
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:42,580
a consensus internationally that,
that this place is evil.

741
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,780
You know what I mean?
It's not like,

742
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:45,220
you know,
Libya where these other countries have

743
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:47,560
their back and you're ran a rock and all
this other stuff with us.

744
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:48,790
More religious though,
right?

745
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:50,650
And with this they don't.
No one has their back,

746
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,110
like maybe some weird African countries
they have allies with,

747
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:54,640
but everyone in that region is like,
all right,

748
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:57,010
this shit's a nightmare and enough's
enough.

749
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,660
Well,
it's fucking hilarious.

750
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:03,460
Whenever they try to show some display a
power and they have a launch of like

751
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,850
some missile that shoots 13 feet up in
the air and then explode.

752
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:08,410
That could be intentional.
You think so?

753
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,990
So they can't back down ever.
Right.

754
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:14,530
But if you want to back down without
backing down is you make a mistake.

755
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,000
Right.
So it looks like you don't have the

756
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:17,320
power.
Really.

757
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,240
That's,
that's where I would put my money.

758
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,131
Wow.
That's,

759
00:31:20,131 --> 00:31:22,480
that's some weird fucking multilevel
chest.

760
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,330
They are.
They've been playing multilevel chest

761
00:31:24,331 --> 00:31:25,380
since the forties.
They didn't have,

762
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,840
but they're all about face about showing
like that.

763
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,870
That's one of the things about Korea
will all I know about a South Korea.

764
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,080
I know quite a bit about South Korean
culture and the way I grew up learning

765
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:41,350
and teaching taekwondo.
So I was around a lot of Koreans and

766
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:44,890
they're very much about honor and
they're very much about hard work and

767
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:46,750
they're very much about appearances,
right?

768
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,310
Like the idea of giving up,
like showing a weakness like that

769
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:54,460
intentionally seems pretty alien.
Well the choice is,

770
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,130
are you.
If trump says if you go forward with

771
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:58,810
this,
we're going to attack you.

772
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,630
So that's not on the table.
So plan B isn't like,

773
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:03,910
okay,
we're going to give in plan b would be

774
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,940
to act like you're defying him,
but not actually defining it.

775
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,220
That sounds so ridiculous.
It's fascinating though.

776
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:12,190
I'm not disagreeing with their shit.
I mean I,

777
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:14,320
that's where I would put my money
because think about it,

778
00:32:14,321 --> 00:32:16,390
if you are doing these tests,
you're going to be,

779
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,570
you're going to be testing it and
publicly how many times,

780
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:20,710
like in America you're going to have
some,

781
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,450
you know,
I guess windows crashes,

782
00:32:22,451 --> 00:32:24,010
but people go through this over and
over,

783
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:25,520
especially when your life is at risk,
right?

784
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,780
So you're going to make damn sure that
it's going to be working before you

785
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:29,614
announced,
you know,

786
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,480
April 14th.
We're having our big launch,

787
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,100
right,
but aren't they developing this

788
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:36,100
technology in a vacuum as opposed to
most of the rest of the world?

789
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,770
Like if you're.
You're dealing with United States,

790
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,220
right?
The United States is,

791
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,660
first of all,
we have the internet.

792
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,720
Second of all,
we have some of the very best aerospace

793
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:48,710
engineers in the world.
The most knowledgeable people in terms

794
00:32:48,711 --> 00:32:52,280
of rocketry and explosions and all that
shit like you're dealing with is

795
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:55,220
fantastic database of human beings to
draw from,

796
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,210
but they're isolated like wouldn't it
make sense that their stuff kind of

797
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,730
sucks,
but what I'm saying is if it sucks,

798
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:05,870
they would do the test privately and in
some hidden place until they got the

799
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:07,940
kinks out.
Then they would publicly do it when

800
00:33:07,941 --> 00:33:11,570
they've got the kinks out.
Why would you publicly show your hand

801
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,390
unless you had a purpose?
While they probably don't have enough

802
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:17,020
money to run nearly enough tests like
we.

803
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,030
We know that they have done some tests
that we've observed,

804
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,950
but remember there was a.
There was some concern.

805
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,270
They detonated a nuke.

806
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,660
You have nukes 100 percent,
but there was concern that they had

807
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:28,770
detonated run under,
I believe it was underground.

808
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,410
Yeah,
it was a few years back.

809
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:33,050
Right.
But my point is we don't know,

810
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,800
and this would be something that would
be up their alley and it would be.

811
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:40,120
I don't understand why they would
announce something unless they were sure

812
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,470
they could do it because that's really
about face.

813
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:42,980
It's like,
you know,

814
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,500
here's our big launch and then you turn
on the TV doesn't work.

815
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,150
That's amazing.
I never thought of that.

816
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,410
You might be right,
but it's.

817
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:50,150
It's fascinating to think about it that
way.

818
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,250
Does anybody share your opinion?
Is this a call?

819
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,080
Yes.
I mean really it's not.

820
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,480
It's not like there's a huge community
of people who understand North Korea,

821
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:01,460
but this is what people who have watched
the country do share is the consensus

822
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:03,470
that you can't take shit at face value
ever with them.

823
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,300
Wow,
that's amazing.

824
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,820
That's a really amazing sort of
strategy.

825
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:12,110
If that really is the case,
it's really very self aware.

826
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,220
Yes.
We'll look at.

827
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,330
Look at La.
Two years ago,

828
00:34:14,331 --> 00:34:16,010
my buddy called me.
They had a,

829
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,430
they had a photo they released if Kim
Jong Il and on his Mac book and behind

830
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:21,350
him was a map of the US where the nukes
are going to hit,

831
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,090
including Austin.
My friend calls me goes,

832
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,620
are they get a Nuke Austin?
It's like,

833
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,540
listen,
if I'm looking Austin,

834
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,340
why the fuck am I putting this on my
instagram?

835
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,010
Like what are you talking about?
You know?

836
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:33,620
And of course they didn't Nuke Austin,
Austin,

837
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,110
I don't.
I mean maybe they know how many bullets

838
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:38,900
are in Texas when they passed the last
place to invade.

839
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,760
Well,
the way they operate like this,

840
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:42,440
like there's two types of bank robbers,
right?

841
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:44,480
There's the bank robber comes in,
shoots up the ceiling,

842
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:45,410
gets diluted,
gets out.

843
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,300
Then there's the bank robber comes in,
shoots up everyone,

844
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,330
and you know,
you deal with the first one when they

845
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:52,130
were firing their missiles,
they're fragmented the ocean,

846
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,810
they're not firing them into Tokyo or
Seoul.

847
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,460
That's telling,
right?

848
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,700
Yeah.
Well they don't want to get killed right

849
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,710
there.
They want to show that they have metal,

850
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,880
right?
And they want to say,

851
00:35:01,881 --> 00:35:04,370
hey,
we can launch a missile at Los Angeles,

852
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,310
or I sold 10 million people.
I mean,

853
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,240
you can't even.
I mean,

854
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:08,930
they're like,
what about nukes?

855
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,670
What about nukes?
I said,

856
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,520
that's on Fox.
The other day.

857
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:13,370
He goes,
you really nuke smokes.

858
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:16,130
You care about missiles hitting those
skyscrapers and soul.

859
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:17,570
Can you even imagine what that would
look like?

860
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,880
It would be like independence day.
It'd be insane.

861
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,400
And it's close.
It's extremely close.

862
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:24,230
So the missiles would get there in a
matter of minutes,

863
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,830
if not,
if not even lying.

864
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,250
Yeah.
Um,

865
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:32,060
what do you think about the theory
that's been run back and forth pretty

866
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:34,790
recently?
That the United States sabotage those

867
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,040
same way they sabotage the Iranian?
That

868
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,530
would be great.
That would be.

869
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,100
I don't know what I'm talking about.
Sap knows.

870
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,740
Okay.
They sabotaged the Iranian nuclear

871
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:51,600
program with viruses and they're saying
that it could perhaps have been the same

872
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:54,540
case with North Korea,
that they sabotage the missile program

873
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,710
with some sort of computer environment
that we have.

874
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,570
That also is very plausible.
Would it be hacking or would it be

875
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,600
something along the lines of someone
clandestine selling some sort of,

876
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,940
you know,
technology to them that turns out to be

877
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:12,690
technology with an embedded virus.
My understanding was it was hacking

878
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:13,920
hacking.
Allegedly.

879
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,813
Allegedly.
Yeah.

880
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,380
But if they have.
Okay.

881
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,360
I'm not sure I understand how they would
do that.

882
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,460
Well,
they are on there.

883
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:22,650
I mean it's their online of kind of
online.

884
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,860
Right.
So there would be a way to get to it,

885
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,130
especially if China's helping us,
you know,

886
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:31,950
the,
the ins and outs of international

887
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,460
espionage and politics and sabotage and
all that shit.

888
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:40,490
It is unbelievably fascinating to me and
I think most people don't even have the

889
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,640
slightest understanding of how deep that
shit go and how hard people like in the

890
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:52,560
CIA work and the people that are
embedded in these essentially terrorist

891
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:55,200
organizations like this was one of the
things that came out about trump

892
00:36:55,201 --> 00:37:00,201
revealing to Russia that these laptops
that isis was planning on using laptops

893
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:05,760
for bombs and in doing so,
he gave them top secret information that

894
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:09,500
he felt he had the right to declassify
it.

895
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,171
Give it to them.
Well,

896
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:13,230
he claimed to have clients,
but the people that have I that I've

897
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,990
talked to that have an understanding,
understanding of the intelligence

898
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:18,600
community,
say that in doing so,

899
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,920
you compromise all the people that
worked very hard to get to the position

900
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:27,921
to find out that isis was doing this,
so now isis has to take an account of

901
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:31,110
all the people and some sort of an audit
of all the people that they're in

902
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:34,890
contact with and then try to figure out
how the fuck this got out and who,

903
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,070
who are the sketchy people or the
questionable people and then puts people

904
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:41,280
in danger and people have to flee and
apparently they had to.

905
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,310
When trump did that,
they had to alert the intelligence

906
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:47,940
community like immediately,
and this is one of the reasons why even

907
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:51,570
though it seems benign to him on a
surface level because he's thinking

908
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:53,520
about a million different things,
right?

909
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,460
He's thinking about a million different
things all at once and his lack of

910
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:59,940
understanding about the importance and
significance of top secret clearance

911
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,580
according to the people that have.
I,

912
00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:06,330
I've communicated with is why it's so
dangerous for him to just talk about

913
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:09,270
this stuff with Russia will also this
whole thing where people are like,

914
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:10,710
Oh,
who cares about Hillary's server?

915
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:12,660
It's just like I,
this is the secretary of state.

916
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,730
Are you equal kind of shit.
She's got on there.

917
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:17,190
Who the hell knows we have a real
problem in this country of being on

918
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:19,350
teams and we have a real problem in this
country.

919
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,010
People that don't like trump thinking
that hillary would have been a great

920
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:26,340
president.
It's a real problem because I'm not a

921
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:27,600
fan of either.
Right?

922
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,610
And I think you as a,
as a human being,

923
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:32,820
should expect more from someone who
wants to run the free world,

924
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,980
right?
Where I should expect someone.

925
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,440
First of all,
you'd expect someone who you can clearly

926
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,460
tell is going to be honest.
And you can tell that from either one of

927
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:45,370
them.
You want someone who has principles and

928
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:47,410
sticks with them.
You can't tell that from either one of

929
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:48,170
them.
You know,

930
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:51,010
it's not what we need.
We need something greater.

931
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,340
And I think there's a great article and
motherboard today,

932
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,550
uh,
about,

933
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,030
it's essentially something that I've
been saying for years that the United

934
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,940
States is far too complicated to be run
by a president and that the idea is

935
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,910
antiquated.
It was an idea that was created back

936
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:05,470
when people came over here on boats.

937
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,790
Well,
I had an article for the observer and

938
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,610
article called the case for American
succession.

939
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:12,820
And the point I made was a,
we've had two culture since the

940
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:16,270
beginning and I agree with you
completely to have one guy running

941
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,210
everything or one woman is nuts.
Well,

942
00:39:18,211 --> 00:39:22,760
what's thought to break stuff up when he
fired comey that woke a lot of people

943
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:23,141
up.
It's like,

944
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:24,040
well,
you could just do that.

945
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,860
You just fire the guy who's in charge of
investigating him.

946
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,330
Right?
How the fuck does that work?

947
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,940
I think it was also because Columbia,
six,

948
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,970
eight.
Yeah.

949
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:31,780
He's a giant dude.
Yeah.

950
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,390
And I,
I,

951
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,540
I,
I can tell him what's that evening that

952
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,410
bothered him.
He tell you,

953
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:37,960
telling me that trump doesn't like
looking up to someone no way.

954
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,360
Well,
if the guy was totally down for him and

955
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:42,340
hugged him back and told him that,
listen,

956
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:43,030
don't worry about it.

957
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:47,480
Your boyfriend's physically,
he can look it up saying that if clint,

958
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:51,140
but if,
if Comi was like totally on board at a

959
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,680
total trumpkins,
if he came in and just acquiesce asked,

960
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,800
you don't think that he'd still be on.
He's still beyond,

961
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:59,230
but trump didn't like it.
He'd make him be sitting when he walks

962
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:01,540
in a room with some shit.
I mean he's a very petty person,

963
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:05,190
which is what I admired about him.
I was listening to Sam Harris podcast

964
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,530
recently where they were,
he was talking with two political

965
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,850
experts.
I forget their names,

966
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:14,851
but two women who were talking about the
case for succession succession or excuse

967
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:16,271
me,
the k,

968
00:40:16,271 --> 00:40:19,930
the case for impeachment,
and they were essentially saying that

969
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,040
his attention span is so short that they
have to give them visual aids and they

970
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:27,430
have to put his name as many times as
they came in and memos because he

971
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:30,310
searches for his name when he goes and
reads from Amazon.

972
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,200
I don't know if that's true.
I mean,

973
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:37,201
I don't know if that's maybe some sneaky
way of getting under his skin to get him

974
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:41,260
to go fucking crazy,
which like you're talking about

975
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:43,480
multilevel chest with North Korea doing
that thing.

976
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,330
I would feel like if that's the way to
fuck with the guy,

977
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,540
it's still leak shit like this out and
to say things like this,

978
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:52,900
like he needs visual aids or he needs
his name research funny.

979
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,950
So he could rather his name mentioned
multiple times and these memos.

980
00:40:55,951 --> 00:40:57,110
So he looks for his name.
Well,

981
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,150
there's me.
Yeah.

982
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:58,591
Well,
I,

983
00:40:58,591 --> 00:41:03,490
I think people are so willing to believe
the worst about people that they hate,

984
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,250
that it gets cartoonish.
I remember during the two thousands

985
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:09,460
where some journalists said,
I don't think George w dot Bush can read

986
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,450
me like a healthy happy,
and it's like he went to Harvard and

987
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:14,320
Yale.
Come on.

988
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,470
Well,
I don't hate trump.

989
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,550
I don't.
A lot of people think that it's a,

990
00:41:19,551 --> 00:41:21,730
it's a good thing to hate him.
I hate him as president.

991
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,040
I don't hate him as a person.
I don't,

992
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,180
I don't,
I don't hate him.

993
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,210
I don't know,
doing this country a great service by

994
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:32,770
making them suspicious of our democratic
process that I've been making this

995
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:33,980
argument for a couple of years on,
on

996
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,520
on many different shows that it's very
healthy for people to be like,

997
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:40,850
if this is the outcome,
you need to double check that this is

998
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:43,400
the system you love.
He's the monkey wrench in the gears of

999
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:44,350
the model t.
yeah,

1000
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,820
and we don't need a model t anymore.
The Tesla,

1001
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,680
right?
This is 2017,

1002
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:52,760
something far more advanced and what we
can't just keep patching up the model to

1003
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,020
its current year.
Yeah.

1004
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:57,800
We don't want windows 95 with all the
upgrades for 2017.

1005
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,940
You get the fuck Outta here right now.
Ninety five to have politics divided

1006
00:42:01,941 --> 00:42:05,030
geographically is a very outdated way of
looking at the.

1007
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,010
Yeah,
and also to have representative

1008
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:09,470
governments very outdated.
We don't need someone to represent us

1009
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:11,690
anymore.
We can communicate instantaneously.

1010
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,880
Right.
Everyone has a communication device

1011
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,250
essentially.
Everyone except for.

1012
00:42:15,251 --> 00:42:18,650
You're a crazy fucker.
He doesn't even use a phone anymore,

1013
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:23,300
but everyone else is using modern cell
phones where you could tweet for or you

1014
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:25,490
could,
you could vote from anywhere in the

1015
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:26,324
world essentially.

1016
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,800
Right?
That's how it should be.

1017
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,050
Yes,
we should have technology and we should

1018
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:32,120
have a government.
I mean we should have rather a

1019
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:35,750
government that recognizes the current
technology and utilize it to get the

1020
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:37,510
voice of the people out there.
Well,

1021
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,380
the,
the technology is what's actually making

1022
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:43,600
the government put in its place and it's
going at an increasingly fast rates and

1023
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:47,630
integrative and it's also,
what I'm fascinated by is all these

1024
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:48,920
trolls.
Now.

1025
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,230
I'm a professional.
I'm writing a book about this on trolls

1026
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,130
and the new,
right?

1027
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:53,030
Yeah.
Well the new.

1028
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,320
Well,
it's not just the new,

1029
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,540
right?
I mean you can call them the new right,

1030
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,430
but they could easily be left.
What I'm fascinated by is these people

1031
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:05,300
that they.
They belong to a group and they are in

1032
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:06,660
an identity group.
Yeah,

1033
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,350
and that's what it is.
You're telling me that green frog is

1034
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,100
outright.

1035
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:10,551
No,
man.

1036
00:43:10,551 --> 00:43:12,390
That's people having a good time to
chat.

1037
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,900
Held chapter with this.
There's a group online on twitter who

1038
00:43:14,901 --> 00:43:17,780
were yelling at me to shout them out.
What are they called?

1039
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,210
I'm not going to say it because I said,
well,

1040
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,300
tell me what the.
Write it down.

1041
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:20,991
I'll shout them out.
No,

1042
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:21,824
no,
hold on.

1043
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:24,080
I said,
you got Admin facebook,

1044
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:25,860
so I know your real name.
I'm not shouting at somebody.

1045
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,620
Turns out to be a mass murderer and he
wouldn't do it.

1046
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:28,880
I'm like,
you're not getting a shout out,

1047
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,790
but he's a whole group as a whole group
of Ms. Murder.

1048
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:32,860
Well,
just the one guy like,

1049
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,040
shout out our leader.
I'm like,

1050
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,870
you gotta give me your name while you
can have a leader.

1051
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:36,980
Boys.
I'm not shouting you out.

1052
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:39,350
If you have a leader.
There shouldn't be any leaders.

1053
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,910
I don't think we should have leaders
anymore.

1054
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,280
I really don't.
I think there's 350 million people in

1055
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:46,580
this country and the idea of leaders is
some old school alpha chimp.

1056
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:49,640
Bullshit to say right here.
That's the very first sentence in my

1057
00:43:49,641 --> 00:43:51,040
book.
Wow.

1058
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,060
When the world leader or leadership
returns to currently.

1059
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:56,870
Yeah,
man,

1060
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:57,371
you're,
you're.

1061
00:43:57,371 --> 00:44:02,371
You're essentially saying exactly that
relapse into barbarism.

1062
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,060
That's a great word.
Yeah.

1063
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,400
Barbarism is a great word.
It is.

1064
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,230
Mussolini was.
It'll do it.

1065
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,050
Yeah.
He was the leader and this was patterson

1066
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:13,990
from what was 1943?
Yeah.

1067
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:16,101
Yeah.
Well,

1068
00:44:16,101 --> 00:44:17,810
I think they recognized it back then and
they,

1069
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:20,270
you know,
it's escalated and compounded since then

1070
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,980
because society has gotten more
complicated.

1071
00:44:21,981 --> 00:44:25,100
We've gotten more diverse ideologically
at remember in the eighties where every

1072
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:28,670
hack comedian would make a joke about
how this diet coke and caffeine free

1073
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:31,230
coke and all these other cooks.
It's like we still have two choices or

1074
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:31,710
politics.

1075
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,900
Why?
Yeah,

1076
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,110
I know.
Isn't that amazing?

1077
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:35,420
That was in the 19 eighties.
Yeah.

1078
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,640
We had 100 different kinds of cokes and
coke.

1079
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,380
New Coke was terrible.
He doesn't read.

1080
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:42,600
He's too young.
Jamie's very erudite,

1081
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:43,980
man.
You ever knew coach Jimmy?

1082
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:46,950
He knows things that from coke classic
to the new coke.

1083
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,410
Did you ever.
Were you aware of Pepsi Spice?

1084
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:54,690
Isn't that knew my friend Brian single
handedly might have nuked Pepsi Spice

1085
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,620
Back.
Is it Pepsi fires now?

1086
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,700
Does he?
Um.

1087
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:00,390
I wonder if Brian still has that
website.

1088
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,480
He had a website.
He bought Pepsi Spice Dot Com.

1089
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:07,650
It was fucking hilarious.
It's one of his best roles like and he

1090
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:12,400
started writing about how he was on a
diet of drinking only Pepsi spice and so

1091
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,560
and as time went on he started getting
sicker and sicker and his diary and he

1092
00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:20,490
talking about like shitting out blood
and maybe I should go to the hospital

1093
00:45:20,491 --> 00:45:25,491
and Pepsi Spices fucking freaking out
and try to figure out like who is this

1094
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:25,800
guy?

1095
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,510
How did he get Pepsi?
[inaudible] DOT com.

1096
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:31,080
He bought Pepsi [inaudible] Dot Com.
Like the moment it came out.

1097
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,580
Well two things.
First of all,

1098
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:35,460
if you go read the reviews for sugar
free gummy bears on Amazon,

1099
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,730
it's the whole.
It's the similar.

1100
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:37,710
Same thing.
Yeah.

1101
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:39,210
Yeah.
I own cadbury,

1102
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:41,890
creme [inaudible] dot com and I guess I
should do.

1103
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,410
I do.
I should do something with it.

1104
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,720
Why don't,
why don't you sell it to cadbury creme

1105
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:48,420
eggs while we give you a million bucks.
They got my email,

1106
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:53,030
they holler at mic is right here,
and I also will throw in fucktard's dot

1107
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,320
org for free.
Whew.

1108
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,970
That's worth trying to hide it.
Pepsi is,

1109
00:45:56,971 --> 00:46:01,260
if you Google it,
it will expire at some vending machine.

1110
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:05,250
Oh,
they're trying to spice instead.

1111
00:46:05,251 --> 00:46:08,460
It's autocorrecting for you incorrectly.
See that did the second thing.

1112
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:10,800
There you go.
Brian redbands.

1113
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,470
Pepsin spice challenge.
Hoax is one of the funniest things.

1114
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:14,760
Ign.
Go Click on that.

1115
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:17,060
On Iga.
Yeah.

1116
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,520
Holidays.
And he did this and I want to say he did

1117
00:46:23,521 --> 00:46:27,840
this in like 2004 is when I came here.
That's what I was going to say.

1118
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,570
It was one of his best trolls ever.
Beautiful.

1119
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,300
Yeah,
he came for days too.

1120
00:46:32,301 --> 00:46:36,000
He kept updating
still there?

1121
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:38,310
Yes.
Still Drinking Pepsi.

1122
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,650
Spiced.blogspot.com.
Oh,

1123
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:43,020
that's amazing.
And it's 2004.

1124
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,490
Yeah.
My friend,

1125
00:46:44,491 --> 00:46:45,470
uh,
he,

1126
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,810
he gave me the idea for this book just
an ass.

1127
00:46:47,811 --> 00:46:49,830
She invented Bacon is Bacon,
salt,

1128
00:46:49,831 --> 00:46:54,831
all these bacon products.
And taco bell had a line of like Tacos

1129
00:46:54,841 --> 00:46:56,550
with Bacon in.
It was like a special promotion.

1130
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:00,900
So he made a Taco out of Bacon,
the shell was baking like a week and he

1131
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,170
goes,
you're a Taco bell corporate meeting

1132
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:08,190
because this is on their big launch and
they're just like a thank you for your

1133
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:09,700
appreciation of.
They can't be like that.

1134
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:10,543
You're not the devil.

1135
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,620
That's crazy though.
How were they getting all that bacon?

1136
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:17,340
That's what you really want to see this
fucking warehouse full of tortured pit.

1137
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,560
Um,
I don't know.

1138
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:22,560
We got way off track here yet,
but what we're saying essentially before

1139
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:27,561
we got onto this crazy rant is that we
need an updated form of government,

1140
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,710
you know,
and we needed an updated form of

1141
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:32,980
government with qualified people.
Neil degrasse Tyson had an amazing tweet

1142
00:47:32,981 --> 00:47:34,840
the other day I think is really
important.

1143
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,540
He was talking about members of
Congress,

1144
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:39,670
I believe it was.
And he was saying,

1145
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,300
look at all these people in government
and what are their occupations?

1146
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:44,260
Lawyer,
lawyer,

1147
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:44,981
lawyer,
lawyer.

1148
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:47,320
He's like,
where the engineers were.

1149
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:49,570
The scientists were the math petition.
That's a,

1150
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,570
that's a dangerous road because the rest
of life communists said there were

1151
00:47:52,571 --> 00:47:55,450
scientific,
scientific socialism and those engineers

1152
00:47:55,451 --> 00:47:59,500
are the ones who regard human beings as
factors to be thrown into equation and

1153
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,640
that's when you get the meat grinder.

1154
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,690
Jesus Christ.
So you.

1155
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:03,340
St Sciences,
Philip Meat Grinders.

1156
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,620
I was saying when scientists try to
become politicians,

1157
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:07,360
they start,
stop looking at human beings as human

1158
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:09,670
beings and start looking at them as
factors in the machine.

1159
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:10,930
Yeah,
it's very sick.

1160
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,240
Have you been paying attention to what's
going on with Bill Nye?

1161
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:17,120
Scientists are all going after bill.
Neither Mr Guy the Weimer.

1162
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:17,910
Yeah.
What's.

1163
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,780
Why?
Why are Germany is right before Hitler

1164
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:23,770
was El decadent and like everyone's just
completely loose and cultural liberal

1165
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:26,020
and he's having these dancers about
talking about their vagina.

1166
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:27,950
It's why motor.
That was what was ridiculous.

1167
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,050
Not even a scientist.
No,

1168
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:30,610
he's not.
Yeah,

1169
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:33,340
it tastes.
He's a con man.

1170
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,720
Isn't he an engineer?
Yeah,

1171
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:38,370
but he's not a climatologist.
He's not a scientist and he's also

1172
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,620
changing his tune.
There was A.

1173
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:46,240
Steven crowder did a bit about it where
he showed the original show that he did

1174
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:50,620
many years ago where they talked about
how gender is from chromosomes,

1175
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:53,650
there's double x,
which is men and or women in x,

1176
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:56,840
y,
which was men and they are establishing

1177
00:48:56,841 --> 00:48:58,100
like what causes your gender?

1178
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,850
Right,
and now he's completely gone off of that

1179
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:06,150
and his new thing had this woman who
belonged in some fucking Venice theater

1180
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:11,170
group,
like barking out at a poetry slam,

1181
00:49:11,171 --> 00:49:16,171
some unbelievably God awful song and
this motherfucker put it on Netflix and

1182
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,300
a science show about gender and he
pretended to be like a,

1183
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:23,020
a Dj in the background.
Like this is so not science,

1184
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,430
right?
It's not scientific consulting.

1185
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,360
Progressivism is just Christianity
without the mythology.

1186
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,790
So it's.
It's very much this kind of Christian

1187
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,370
ideal,
radical progressive as correct.

1188
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,350
Which evangelical progressive is
specifically.

1189
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:36,580
I don't mean someone who like believes
in welfare.

1190
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,740
I mean there's this ideology that he's
fallen into.

1191
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,070
What's a complete religion which has
completely divorced from reality and

1192
00:49:42,071 --> 00:49:44,440
stuff like this.
It's full left wing.

1193
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,370
I mean,
I think there's.

1194
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,100
There's great ideas and being
progressive,

1195
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:50,800
there's some amazing ideas in terms of
inclusiveness,

1196
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:55,090
in terms of live and let live,
letting people be whoever they want,

1197
00:49:55,091 --> 00:49:58,600
express yourselves in any way that you
can see fit as long as it's not hurting

1198
00:49:58,601 --> 00:50:00,050
others,
but that stuff is aggressively

1199
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:00,880
propaganda.

1200
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,650
It's meant to be propaganda.
What is it?

1201
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,820
His show?
His show is.

1202
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:08,290
Yes.
I think what he's doing is licking his

1203
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:10,210
finger,
finding out which way the wind is

1204
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:12,250
blowing and giving into those people.
Now.

1205
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:14,950
I think he's a true believer because you
have to be a true believer to put

1206
00:50:14,951 --> 00:50:17,290
something like that out under your name
and think this is a good idea.

1207
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,510
It's just a quick.
It's like Christian rock.

1208
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,180
I think it's debatable.
I honestly think that these people,

1209
00:50:22,181 --> 00:50:25,880
especially a guy like him who was
experiencing life in the public eye

1210
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,250
fairly late in life,
right?

1211
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,450
And you know,
and he,

1212
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,550
when he,
when it comes to people that are really

1213
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:36,551
enthusiastic about science and really
enthusiastic about these ideas that he's

1214
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:39,860
trying to push on the show other than
this gender thing you're dealing with,

1215
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,680
uh,
the great majority of them are liberal

1216
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:47,210
white majority and I'm sure he
encounters a tremendous amount of

1217
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,830
pressure to be inclusive.

1218
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:53,890
And gender is the hot topic when it
comes to like weird science as it were.

1219
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:57,520
Like trying to figure out like how much
of this is what people feel.

1220
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,620
How much of this can be explained in
genetics?

1221
00:51:00,621 --> 00:51:03,140
How much of this can be explained with
sociology,

1222
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:05,330
how much of it is nature,
how much of it is nurture,

1223
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:08,120
right?
It's a very complex stew of human beings

1224
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:10,790
and we know for a fact that people very
broadly,

1225
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,400
yes,
we have a,

1226
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,530
there's a wide spectrum of human
behavior and likes and needs and

1227
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:19,840
feelings and,
and all sorts of weird dysmorphia is

1228
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,280
right.
We don't know why people behave the way

1229
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:25,340
they behave.
So for him to like boil it down to like

1230
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:27,920
one of the shittiest rap songs the world
has ever known.

1231
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:29,570
Right.
It's an insult.

1232
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:33,320
But I think that's my point is that I
think you have to kind of drank the

1233
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,570
Koolaid to be putting this out as your
product.

1234
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:36,850
Um,
I,

1235
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,540
maybe I'm less cynical than you.
I don't know.

1236
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:41,060
That could be it.
I feel like he's had been influenced by

1237
00:51:41,061 --> 00:51:41,780
real.
Well,

1238
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,780
I think the people that are super
progressive are far more likely to push

1239
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:51,791
these ideas in a very enthusiastic way
than people who are more conservative in

1240
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:54,560
these matters.
They're not going to even approach them

1241
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:55,394
about this.
Right.

1242
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,100
You know,
so I feel like he's just been influenced

1243
00:51:58,101 --> 00:52:01,580
by the influencers.
Well certainly is getting rewarded for

1244
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:03,260
it.
And once you get rewarded for something,

1245
00:52:03,261 --> 00:52:05,180
your brain gets a feedback loop and it's
trying to.

1246
00:52:05,181 --> 00:52:06,890
It's kind of self validating.
So that could be it.

1247
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:07,850
I can't speak.
Here's the,

1248
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:09,590
here's the challenge.
I always have two people who always

1249
00:52:09,591 --> 00:52:12,860
talked about climate change.
If you can't name two types of clouds

1250
00:52:12,861 --> 00:52:15,080
and what they look like,
you don't know enough about science and

1251
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:19,190
climate to open your mouth and that's
him and he's probably an exception.

1252
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:21,890
He probably knows about clouds,
but I'm saying the average person who

1253
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:23,810
reads the New Yorker and they will tell
you,

1254
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:25,550
every scientist agrees that climate
change.

1255
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:28,640
You don't know the names of one
scientist who advised on climate change.

1256
00:52:28,641 --> 00:52:30,140
So shut the fuck up.
It's a mantra.

1257
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,910
It's a mantra that people say,
well,

1258
00:52:31,911 --> 00:52:32,421
this is,
uh,

1259
00:52:32,421 --> 00:52:32,811
the,
the,

1260
00:52:32,811 --> 00:52:34,370
the scientists degree.
Go for it.

1261
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:36,350
Yeah.
I'm not disagreeing with it at all,

1262
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,150
but I am agreeing with what you're
saying.

1263
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,300
I totally disagree with it because the
site with climate change,

1264
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,373
uh,
with this,

1265
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:43,343
with this,
uh,

1266
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:47,630
perception of climate change,
because if we had immediate or coming

1267
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,760
toward the earth,
that is going to destroy a life.

1268
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,370
We're not going to be sitting here
talking about North Korea.

1269
00:52:52,371 --> 00:52:53,181
We're talking about,
hey,

1270
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:54,770
what about the media?
Or are they doing something with this

1271
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:59,150
fucking media or the climate change
supposedly is going to decimate all

1272
00:52:59,151 --> 00:53:00,590
civilization within a hundred years.

1273
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:03,660
Why are we talking about healthcare?
Why are we talking about China and trump

1274
00:53:03,661 --> 00:53:05,600
spelling and his name?
No.

1275
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:08,420
All you're going to be talking about is
the government's going to shut down

1276
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:11,750
until we have an answer to this and
every politician who has children and

1277
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:14,420
grandchildren is going to be like,
we gotta fucking get together and solve

1278
00:53:14,421 --> 00:53:17,660
this problem and the fact that this
isn't happening is telling me that

1279
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,400
there's more to the story than we're
being led to believe.

1280
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,620
How so?
Because the fact that we're talking

1281
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:23,330
about other things.
If this is really this imminent

1282
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:26,280
existential crisis,
how are we talking

1283
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,300
about anything else ever because it's
imminent in terms of maybe 50 years that

1284
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:33,960
people are 49,
how am I gonna I'm not even going to be

1285
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:36,480
here in 50 years was fuck you want to
say thank you to the media or is it

1286
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:39,480
gonna hit America and the world.
In 50 years we wouldn't be doing

1287
00:53:39,481 --> 00:53:41,310
everything possible immediately to stop
it.

1288
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,790
I think there are plenty of people that
would just do coke and fly jets.

1289
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:51,030
I'm not necessarily sure they test all
of their energy to save people that not

1290
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:52,710
even gonna be around to watch.
Sure.

1291
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:56,190
But I think there's certainly 90 percent
of people in Congress,

1292
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:58,380
uh,
90 percent of people in industry care

1293
00:53:58,381 --> 00:54:01,530
enough about their children that this
would be the only issue ever.

1294
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,600
Yes.
If they felt like it was absolutely

1295
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,460
missing and eminent,
I don't think they do.

1296
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,260
I feel like yours is so far away.

1297
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,840
You can't feel it.
I don't think that's true.

1298
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,490
I think for,
especially when you get older,

1299
00:54:11,491 --> 00:54:13,140
when you get older,
you start thinking longterm.

1300
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:16,650
Why is trump backed away?
He accent because he's trump is one data

1301
00:54:16,651 --> 00:54:18,420
point and he's a living.
I know,

1302
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,480
but there's a lot of those lunatics with
tremendous amount of resources that

1303
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:24,750
aren't thinking about the future.
He's rolling back the EPA regulations.

1304
00:54:24,751 --> 00:54:28,710
He's trying to fucking frack everywhere.
What he's doing is he's like,

1305
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,950
he's the guy who was doing coke and
flying the jet wire,

1306
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,940
but look how much opposition there is to
him.

1307
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:35,220
Right?
So the point is,

1308
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:37,070
if this was a real thing,
there wouldn't be opposition.

1309
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,060
It would be complete unanimous.
Unanimity,

1310
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,540
well there's a lot of opposition because
he is air quotes the one percent,

1311
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,510
which means 99 percent are going to be
opposed to the behavior of this one

1312
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:48,720
person who's got billions of dollars and
also has the power to do all this crazy

1313
00:54:48,721 --> 00:54:53,040
shit like roll back the EPA regulations
like somehow or another this fucking

1314
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:57,720
lunatic got into control of
Environmental Protection Agency

1315
00:54:57,721 --> 00:54:58,800
regulations.

1316
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:03,510
I mean it's pretty fucking bizarre.
So that's why this guy is not doing

1317
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:04,230
anything.
He's.

1318
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,570
He is the radical thing that we're
worried about.

1319
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,830
But as you said earlier,
I think he's a good thing and that he's

1320
00:55:10,831 --> 00:55:15,540
exposing how bizarrely flawed the system
is that we are trying to patch up window

1321
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:16,740
17,
76,

1322
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,390
right?
I mean that's really what we're doing.

1323
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,180
Seventy,
89,

1324
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:19,861
70,
76.

1325
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:21,930
We had the artists have federation.
17.

1326
00:55:21,931 --> 00:55:23,560
80 nine was the formation of the United
States.

1327
00:55:23,561 --> 00:55:26,190
Does the constitution.
Why do we always celebrate spirit of 76?

1328
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:29,160
Because that's the American war.
So we were doing independent station.

1329
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:29,971
Yeah,
their commission.

1330
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:31,050
Yeah.
As far as I'm concerned,

1331
00:55:31,051 --> 00:55:32,130
that's it.
That's when it starts.

1332
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,330
80 nine is when the United States was
officially found.

1333
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,280
Was was the.
Yeah,

1334
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,710
but here's the thing.
If the constitution was illegal,

1335
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,690
you know,
they went in,

1336
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:41,010
in the secret couple of people have
talked about the founding fathers.

1337
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,560
They went into Philadelphia secretly.
They said,

1338
00:55:43,561 --> 00:55:45,330
you're not allowed to throw out there.
I was at confederation.

1339
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:46,590
They look at each other.
Go with throwing the shit in the

1340
00:55:46,591 --> 00:55:46,981
garbage,
right?

1341
00:55:46,981 --> 00:55:47,281
That.
Oh yeah,

1342
00:55:47,281 --> 00:55:49,290
yeah.
Sworn to secrecy,

1343
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:53,010
which they did not have the power to do.
Martin Luther went out and told everyone

1344
00:55:53,011 --> 00:55:53,321
goes,
oh,

1345
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:54,570
this is a coo.
And it was.

1346
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,720
It was illegal and everyone's still
champions them like there,

1347
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:58,950
this was all this great,
great thing.

1348
00:55:58,951 --> 00:56:01,350
This was a complete crew and all that
saying that's a bad thing,

1349
00:56:01,351 --> 00:56:04,590
but it was a cool in terms of like.
So who was in control back then?

1350
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:05,424
You mean?
England?

1351
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,960
Between England and the constitution
with the articles of confederation.

1352
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:14,010
So the founding fathers in that
convention had the ability legally to

1353
00:56:14,011 --> 00:56:16,860
edit the articles of confederation.
The first thing that they were like,

1354
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:17,611
yeah,
fuck this thing.

1355
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:21,270
We were totally throwing out the window
despite our mandate and and we're

1356
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,070
supporting each other to secrecy.
Oh Wow.

1357
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,430
That's fascinating.
Yeah.

1358
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,593
Well,
that's what we need.

1359
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:27,130
Well,
I need that today.

1360
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,090
I need someone to fucking go.
This is ridiculous.

1361
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:33,910
We're going to throw this whole thing.
I think that was the big percentage of

1362
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:35,500
the trump vote was this shit's
ridiculous.

1363
00:56:35,501 --> 00:56:36,460
Yes,
I think you're right.

1364
00:56:36,461 --> 00:56:38,520
But now it's even more ridiculous,
which is weird.

1365
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:39,850
Well,
first of all,

1366
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:43,870
a lot of people who were into the idea
that America is going to look after

1367
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:47,440
America and that we're all this foreign
interventionalism,

1368
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:51,130
which is interrupting our lives and
becoming a huge problem.

1369
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,380
And then what does he do?
Bomb Syria,

1370
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,720
drops them all APP bomb.
It starts.

1371
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:59,590
He's over in Saudi Arabia right now
holding onto a big glowing ball with

1372
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:04,591
some dude is dressed like a wizard about
Saudi Arabia and the Moab.

1373
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,390
Who'd you hear it from?
A Jim Norton.

1374
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:11,230
Now I don't remember who I want to say.
Alex Jones for comedic purposes.

1375
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:15,160
Um,
those were two moves to show North Korea

1376
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:18,670
that he's not joking because the Syria
thing went against everything.

1377
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:19,900
He was saying,
the whole campaign,

1378
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,510
Afghanistan,
where the fuck that come from,

1379
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,360
and then the next week they're all
saying we're not messing around with

1380
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:26,800
you.
North Korea at the time for talk is

1381
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:28,270
over.
So that's one theory.

1382
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:32,080
I heard that the moab bomb was just to
show that they're capable of dropping

1383
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:35,440
that and that they're willing to drop it
dropped in the middle of nowhere.

1384
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:37,490
I think about it.
If you're going to show,

1385
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,800
do a show of force when you just throw
it in Afghanistan rather than in

1386
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:41,670
Pyongyang.
Yeah.

1387
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,730
That is the move.
I guess.

1388
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:46,870
It's so fascinating to me that we have
nukes and we'd like to ask too much.

1389
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,350
We're just get drop the biggest
conventional bond known to man won't

1390
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:54,250
drop any nukes,
so that's fine.

1391
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:54,610
We're cool.

1392
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,301
We're cool.
We're cool.

1393
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:57,820
We're cool with that.
Like if he just decided that would be

1394
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:02,080
really fucked up if he just decided to
drop a nuke on isis.

1395
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,730
If he knew that there was this place
where Isis is,

1396
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:08,280
isis is 50,000 of 'em all concentrated
in this one area

1397
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,890
and
we just saw this fucking mushroom cloud

1398
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,250
like that one mushroom.
I mean there's this classic ones from

1399
00:58:18,251 --> 00:58:21,440
the 19 fifties when they did those
nuclear autodesk,

1400
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,810
but if we saw one of those in the news
over and full color.

1401
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,800
Oh yeah.
Oh my God.

1402
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,800
From every angle.
You have the camera phones.

1403
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,290
People from the space station filming
the fucking.

1404
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,880
Yeah.
You could probably see that from space.

1405
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:35,290
Oh yeah,
for sure.

1406
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,130
Fuck.
Yeah.

1407
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,140
And you can see the wall of China.
You can see that.

1408
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,410
I think that's a myth,
isn't it?

1409
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:40,050
Think it isn't matter.

1410
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,450
Yeah.
Unfortunately I think you can see it

1411
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:44,720
from certain satellites.
Right?

1412
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:48,010
You can't see a different.
It's like how high do you get up to 400

1413
00:58:48,011 --> 00:58:50,710
miles probably,
but not like the Hemi v eight.

1414
00:58:50,711 --> 00:58:52,430
Yeah.
It's 22,000 miles away.

1415
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,850
Detail about that one now.
Yeah,

1416
00:58:54,851 --> 00:58:58,510
he did it right.
He did a c space that either from a jet.

1417
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,920
Um,
I wonder like what it would take for

1418
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:06,760
trump to want to drop a nuke in like a
select location because I feel like

1419
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,000
there's ever a president that'd be
willing to drop a nuke in the right

1420
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:11,440
spot.
He'd be the guy.

1421
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,940
You don't think they put a bullet in him
first.

1422
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:18,730
I don't see enough resistance to him
currently.

1423
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,100
You don't know who's around him though?
The secret service or if he's going to

1424
00:59:21,101 --> 00:59:23,330
nuke Russia,
I can see them being like executive

1425
00:59:23,331 --> 00:59:24,680
decision.
I'm shooting this guy.

1426
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,420
Damn,
that would be the end of their life

1427
00:59:26,421 --> 00:59:28,640
though.
Some of them not necessarily.

1428
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,070
It was someone shot at the president
because he was about to drop a nuke

1429
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,900
guarantee.
You someone will shoot the guy who shot

1430
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:34,000
the president.
I,

1431
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,820
unless there's some kind of protocol in
place that if this guy goes completely

1432
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:38,990
nuts,
what do we do then?

1433
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:41,220
You know what's really fucked me up,
man?

1434
00:59:41,221 --> 00:59:43,490
I'm house of cards.
Oh yeah.

1435
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,100
I watched that show.
The same thing from a comedic

1436
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,370
perspective.
Oh,

1437
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,010
the new season's coming out like next
week.

1438
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,840
Yeah,
just a masterpiece.

1439
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:51,830
Just finished.
We,

1440
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:56,860
me and the missus binge watched the
entire series and three fourths,

1441
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,093
four seasons,
right?

1442
00:59:58,410 --> 00:59:59,930
The course of a couple months.
Oh Wow.

1443
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,420
Fucking awesome.
If you haven't seen it,

1444
01:00:02,421 --> 01:00:05,450
ladies and gentlemen,
it's a masterpiece.

1445
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:08,960
It's maybe one of the best shows ever on
television and it gets.

1446
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:11,330
It starts out you like.
It was pretty good and then it gets

1447
01:00:11,331 --> 01:00:15,260
deeper and deeper and crazier and
crazier and there's never what I call a

1448
01:00:15,261 --> 01:00:19,460
cut the shit scene like in every show in
season three when she's in Russia and

1449
01:00:19,461 --> 01:00:21,560
she feels bad for the gay kid.
That's a cut.

1450
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:22,970
The Shit.
This woman is a sociopath.

1451
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:29,320
She's not losing control and power just
to some gay rushed and she met the dude

1452
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,300
who hangs himself.
Spoiler alert.

1453
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:36,140
I don't know.
I felt like that was as much political

1454
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:39,180
as it was anything else,
but they showed her really caring.

1455
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:42,290
You know,
I got to know these people are murderers

1456
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:46,580
perhaps you're a bit cynical.
Little on me.

1457
01:00:46,581 --> 01:00:48,930
Pretty bad.
And the Steve Irwin Boomerang hard.

1458
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:53,210
The late Steve Irwin.
Is he a boomerang thrower?

1459
01:00:53,211 --> 01:00:55,730
I thought it was just like wrestling
crocodiles and showed us how to do that

1460
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:57,190
shit.
I'd probably got less.

1461
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,700
Everybody knows how to write.
Yeah,

1462
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,140
just chuck them.
I mean,

1463
01:01:00,141 --> 01:01:01,880
is there a technique to throw a
boomerang?

1464
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,110
Oh yeah,
of course.

1465
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:04,350
Right?
Yeah.

1466
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:06,470
Because they had.
It was weapons to knock things out.

1467
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,800
What was the idea was that you would
throw it and then it would kind of come

1468
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:11,030
back at you if you missed.

1469
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:13,100
Right,
but which is funny because if you

1470
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:14,880
actually have good aim,
it's not coming back because it's

1471
01:01:14,881 --> 01:01:16,060
trajectories.
Complete change,

1472
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:18,260
but you're knocking things out of trees
or knocking birds out.

1473
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:21,470
I mean the great way to get a bee hive
off a tree.

1474
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:22,750
Oh,
is that what they use them for?

1475
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:23,511
Right.
I'm guessing.

1476
01:01:23,511 --> 01:01:24,800
I don't fucking know.
It kind of makes sense.

1477
01:01:24,801 --> 01:01:25,430
Right?
What?

1478
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:28,620
It's kind of an ingenious device.
When you think about what a boomerang.

1479
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,550
You remember when you were a kid the
first time you saw one or played with

1480
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:32,301
and you're like,
oh my God,

1481
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:34,370
this is magic.
I maybe only played with one once or

1482
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:38,150
twice in my whole life when I was a kid
I had one and I couldn't get it to work,

1483
01:01:38,151 --> 01:01:39,530
but I got to the kind of work and I'm
like,

1484
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,240
this is the.
This is the future.

1485
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:44,030
This is a gay for his book.
This is

1486
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,580
all due respect to my gay friends at the
MSI friends.

1487
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,340
I'm like,
this is just to make any sense.

1488
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,460
I don't get what you're doing here.
I don't have any.

1489
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,850
It's.
It was like a weapon when it wasn't for

1490
01:01:58,851 --> 01:01:59,420
war though,
right?

1491
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,590
Was for hunting?
Yeah,

1492
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:01,850
I think so.
It's like,

1493
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,220
don't you guys know about the bone
marrow?

1494
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,810
We'll hook you guys up.
Lack of birds over in Australia.

1495
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:11,390
They didn't have enough feathers and
like what do we do with these sticks?

1496
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,490
But what about the Kookaburra lot of
that.

1497
01:02:13,491 --> 01:02:16,580
The Kookaburra Kookaburra.
It's their big bird.

1498
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:18,860
That's always laughing Baja about moves,
right?

1499
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:21,570
Don't they have feathers?
Are you most at as one of them is in

1500
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,490
Australia.
There's the ostrich.

1501
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,920
The email in the Ria.
I guess the Amazon Australia have huge

1502
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:26,920
feathers.
Yeah.

1503
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:29,990
You feel like it could be trimmed down
for flushings?

1504
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:32,100
Oh yeah.
I didn't know any better.

1505
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:34,350
Did you see that recent thing where they
said that the most,

1506
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,560
uh,
the,

1507
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:38,610
they found that the earliest
Australians,

1508
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:42,840
the earliest indigenous people landed in
Australia 50,000 years ago,

1509
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:44,520
which is fucking incredible.
Oh yeah.

1510
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,040
Like how the hell they get their 50,000
years ago.

1511
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:47,791
Well,
I mean,

1512
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:48,780
didn't they?
I didn't.

1513
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:50,640
Same thing with like Siberia and the
Bering Strait.

1514
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,050
Right.
Getting to America as the question,

1515
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,940
was there some sort of a landmass that
connected them to somewhere else 50,000

1516
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:56,600
years ago?
I mean,

1517
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,230
they're essentially an isolated
continent.

1518
01:02:58,231 --> 01:02:58,800
Right?
Right.

1519
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,650
Nothing's close unless you have those
archipelagos something New Zealand and

1520
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,760
Papua New Guinea.
Well,

1521
01:03:02,761 --> 01:03:04,020
those people,
especially,

1522
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:09,050
especially the South Pacific people were
incredibly daring in their journeys out

1523
01:03:10,471 --> 01:03:12,870
to see thousands and thousands of years
ago.

1524
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,470
We dug out canoes and these boats that
they would construct and they would just

1525
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:17,670
fucking get out in the ocean.

1526
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,600
Like,
let's see what happens.

1527
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:22,260
They must have been having really bad
marriages to be getting this belt.

1528
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:23,790
Bitch.
I'm going west.

1529
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:26,040
I don't care if there's land,
I'm not staying here with you.

1530
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,173
Yeah.
What?

1531
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:31,770
What makes a person get into a boat
thousands of years ago and looking out

1532
01:03:31,771 --> 01:03:32,491
into the ocean.
Go,

1533
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:34,560
I'm going to take a chance.
And the funny thing is we think that

1534
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,220
they're brave,
but maybe they just really dumb and like

1535
01:03:36,221 --> 01:03:37,320
a bad directions.
Right?

1536
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:40,260
Who knows?
Who knows what causes someone to want to

1537
01:03:40,261 --> 01:03:43,170
do.
And then you get to a continent and

1538
01:03:43,171 --> 01:03:44,430
you're like,
what the fuck do I do now?

1539
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:45,930
I guess this is my house now.
Well,

1540
01:03:45,931 --> 01:03:49,800
how about what they did with Hawaii?
I mean they essentially found a fucking

1541
01:03:49,801 --> 01:03:51,180
volcano.
Just got lucky.

1542
01:03:51,181 --> 01:03:51,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

1543
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,300
Volcano popping out of the middle of the
ocean.

1544
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,000
Yeah.
We lucked out that we fly.

1545
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,260
Fuck yeah,
they did.

1546
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:00,230
And then there's the people that don't
look at so much.

1547
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,880
Very few bugs.
No predators.

1548
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:02,490
Like,
dude,

1549
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:04,920
I thought that's huge bugs.
It's not.

1550
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:06,390
I don't think so.
They don't have snakes.

1551
01:04:06,391 --> 01:04:09,090
I know that they don't have snakes.
I mean maybe they have some bugs,

1552
01:04:09,091 --> 01:04:12,720
but you rarely see legs.
Maybe these spiders and shit.

1553
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,310
The problem with Australia,
excuse me,

1554
01:04:14,311 --> 01:04:18,180
the problem with Hawaii is it a lot of
the stuff that they have over there came

1555
01:04:18,181 --> 01:04:22,020
from somewhere else,
tremendous amount of things like birds

1556
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:25,430
and they were stowaways on boats and
shit.

1557
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,870
Spam,
spam pigs,

1558
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,450
pigs in general,
like a little wild pigs and deer,

1559
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:32,730
all these weird dear access deer from
Asia.

1560
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,610
They just recently had to save the giant
parrot,

1561
01:04:35,611 --> 01:04:39,080
the Kakapo in a near Australia because
they were like 100 left because the Ra,

1562
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,110
because they had no defenses.

1563
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:41,820
They can't fly and the rats are eating
of all.

1564
01:04:41,821 --> 01:04:44,190
So they found,
they found all of them,

1565
01:04:44,191 --> 01:04:46,440
moved them to a different island,
killed the rats and brought her back and

1566
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:47,850
now they're being saved.
Oh Wow.

1567
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,930
They're really cool.
Well,

1568
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:51,930
they've had a bunch of crazy experiments
in Australia with toads,

1569
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,140
toads,
and then with bringing in cats and they

1570
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:59,340
have feral cats and they kill all the
ground nesting birds and foxes to kill

1571
01:04:59,341 --> 01:05:01,700
the cats and cats like nasty.
Like they.

1572
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:05,700
All they do is kill birds and like
rodents in small animals and we think

1573
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,560
because they're cute and you've played
with their belly,

1574
01:05:07,561 --> 01:05:09,360
but they are killing machines.
Well,

1575
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:10,590
they're cute.
If you raise them,

1576
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:13,720
you have them at home and you
domesticate them and give them nothing

1577
01:05:13,721 --> 01:05:17,620
about cat food and pet them all the time
and they purr and they don't have any

1578
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,610
desire to go out there and.

1579
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:21,250
And eat and rape.
Yeah.

1580
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:24,160
All cat sex is rape.
Well,

1581
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:29,110
this way you look at it.
Will they have barb Dicks,

1582
01:05:29,111 --> 01:05:29,550
right?
Yeah.

1583
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:34,000
They steal her up and then if you.
If the male cat sees a female with the

1584
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:35,860
litter,
he kills the litter so she'll get a

1585
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:36,993
population.
Again.

1586
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,910
That's super common in the animal world,
unfortunately.

1587
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,710
Yeah,
and the bear world,

1588
01:05:41,711 --> 01:05:43,360
it's even worse.
They eat them too.

1589
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:46,120
They really.
Bears are almost 100 percent cannibals.

1590
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,290
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

1591
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:51,190
The the male bears eat all the cubs.
It's like the best way.

1592
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,350
It's.
It's so counterintuitive,

1593
01:05:53,351 --> 01:05:57,640
but the best way to ensure a healthy
population of bears is to kill a male's.

1594
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,081
Wow.
Yeah.

1595
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:01,620
You have to kill the old bores.
You go the like,

1596
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,120
that's one of the reasons why they
actually encourage,

1597
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:08,020
especially with black bears,
black bear hunting is encouraged,

1598
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:12,040
is also really important because one of
the main things that they eat is Fonz,

1599
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:16,150
like if you want to have healthy moose
populations in deer populations,

1600
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:20,200
but yeah,
I was there in Alberta when a friend of

1601
01:06:20,201 --> 01:06:25,201
mine actually saw a bear kill a cub and
chase the mother way killed the cub and

1602
01:06:26,411 --> 01:06:28,600
then the mother came back and finished
the cub off.

1603
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:33,460
She hated herself.
It's a dark world in the woods.

1604
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,920
You think North Korea is rough being a
fucking bear?

1605
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,380
Well,
my,

1606
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:37,880
my I,
I might,

1607
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,970
I.
my first job was writing for an aquarium

1608
01:06:39,971 --> 01:06:41,770
magazines.
I've been obsessed with animals since I

1609
01:06:41,771 --> 01:06:43,330
was a kid.
Aquariums.

1610
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,030
That was my thing back in the day.
Oh Man.

1611
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:49,720
I always wanted to have a massive
saltwater fish tank.

1612
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:53,040
The best thing ever.
And I had all these secrets and shit.

1613
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:53,711
Oh No,
no.

1614
01:06:53,711 --> 01:06:57,610
I had the kind of fish I had wrote my
friend called God's mistakes because

1615
01:06:57,611 --> 01:07:01,230
they all look like monsters.
So that's the kind of shit.

1616
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,000
What did you have like a,
there's something called a big guy.

1617
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,100
Uh,
there's something called a cal fish,

1618
01:07:06,101 --> 01:07:08,110
which can't,
it's encased in armor and can't move,

1619
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:10,840
um,
and a soap fish which releases a cloud

1620
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:13,300
of poisoned when it's upset.
And an Angler fish,

1621
01:07:13,301 --> 01:07:15,100
which also doesn't move at a slipper.

1622
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:18,130
I may pull up these things there.
They all look like aliens.

1623
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:21,700
So it was really kind of fun.
Yeah.

1624
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:25,300
It's just electric catfish that you had
an electric shock.

1625
01:07:25,301 --> 01:07:26,410
You,
you in your balls.

1626
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:28,260
Well,
I touched on electric eel.

1627
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:30,520
We were on food fish.
Yes I do.

1628
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,430
If you touch an electric eel,
you're going to get fucked up.

1629
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,860
Those things are no joke.
No,

1630
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:36,760
they're not that bad.
It can kill you.

1631
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:37,630
How long?
How big was it?

1632
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:39,640
That was big enough for me to grab.
I mean,

1633
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:41,290
we,
we did it on fear factor was one of the

1634
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,700
stones.
But you had to do it in one hand.

1635
01:07:42,701 --> 01:07:44,530
You can't do with both hands.
We also go through your heart,

1636
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:46,210
remember?
Yes.

1637
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:47,830
I remember this fear factor.
If something like,

1638
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:49,090
Holy Shit,
where'd they get these electric eels for

1639
01:07:49,091 --> 01:07:50,620
them?
And the thing is they had to do with one

1640
01:07:50,621 --> 01:07:53,170
hand or else it makes a circuit if you
use them both hands.

1641
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:56,020
Maybe.
I don't remember the slipper lobster,

1642
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:59,710
but what I do remember is it sucked.
Like I definitely grabbed it and was

1643
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:00,200
like,
yeah,

1644
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,780
yeah.
It's no joke.

1645
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,160
It's amazing that a small animal can
give you such a charge like that.

1646
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:07,120
And it does it with its body.
The whole,

1647
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:10,070
the anus is right by the mountain.
So the whole thing is electricity.

1648
01:08:10,071 --> 01:08:10,904
Yeah.
Isn't that cool?

1649
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,970
That's why it's electric mouth was right
by the asshole.

1650
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:17,420
It's all fucking confused you to notice
that it's crazy.

1651
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:18,200
Look.
And what is that called?

1652
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,710
A slipper.
Lobster slipper.

1653
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,820
Have lobster tail.
It's often this face of that thing.

1654
01:08:22,821 --> 01:08:24,380
That's insane.
So instead of clause,

1655
01:08:24,381 --> 01:08:25,940
they have faced flaps.
The two hinges.

1656
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,080
Whites.
Yeah.

1657
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,570
If you look at the top,
do you see that one hinge and another?

1658
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:30,830
Yeah,
that's one of the hinges goes up and

1659
01:08:30,831 --> 01:08:31,940
down the other goes left and right.

1660
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:33,680
And all my guts.
So it's like the Predator.

1661
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:34,700
Yeah,
it's really cool.

1662
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:36,820
Do they have one with his mouth open?
Uh,

1663
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:40,670
the mass underneath maybe meaning we're
where it's exposed,

1664
01:08:40,671 --> 01:08:42,090
where it's like grabbing something.
You'd have to be.

1665
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:43,910
No,
so you won't see it because it wouldn't,

1666
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,780
I would feed it,
it would grab it and put it near with

1667
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,210
the belly.
Oh Wow.

1668
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:47,661
Yeah,
yeah,

1669
01:08:47,661 --> 01:08:50,360
yeah.
And pull up a p,

1670
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:55,361
R I s t e g e n y s I didn't know until
like two years ago what cuddle fish and

1671
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:01,060
octopus could do.
My friend remy,

1672
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:04,820
he used to have this show called Apex
Predator where he would study these

1673
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:09,170
predators and try to figure out like
what strategies do you use for catching

1674
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,210
their prey?
And one of the things that he studied

1675
01:09:11,211 --> 01:09:14,420
was a octopus and he came on Octopi and
he was like,

1676
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:15,760
dude,
they're from another planet.

1677
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:18,560
Their smartest cats.
The other very smart,

1678
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:20,150
very smart,
super smart.

1679
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:23,540
And they can not just change the way
they look,

1680
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:25,130
but change their texture.
Right.

1681
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,280
And they fit in perfectly with our
environment.

1682
01:09:27,281 --> 01:09:28,700
Yes.
He showed us some videos and I'm like,

1683
01:09:28,701 --> 01:09:31,810
how am I 48 years old and not knowing
about this.

1684
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,770
They were absolutely.
And the ones at the bottom to see even

1685
01:09:33,771 --> 01:09:35,930
crazier.
Then you have the zebra octopus,

1686
01:09:35,931 --> 01:09:39,710
which is a mimic and the question you
have a philosophy person is,

1687
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:42,500
is it consciously trying to look like
something else or data devolve.

1688
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:43,670
Coincidentally it looked like because
they,

1689
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:47,640
they look like flounders and then squids
and then lion fish and mantis shrimp and

1690
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:49,670
like some of these forms wouldn't be
advantageous.

1691
01:09:49,671 --> 01:09:51,140
Like why would you want to look like a
flounder?

1692
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,870
But it just changes from shape to shape
just very quickly.

1693
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:56,060
Well not only that,
like how does it know what the

1694
01:09:56,061 --> 01:09:58,280
environment looks like to a point where
it could change it,

1695
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:59,540
how does it know what it looks like?

1696
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,190
It doesn't have a mirror.
And that's the other thing.

1697
01:10:01,191 --> 01:10:03,220
They put them on top of a checkerboard
deceased.

1698
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,600
They can emit,
imitate it and they like,

1699
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:05,910
they didn't know what to do.
Yeah,

1700
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:06,410
yeah,
yeah.

1701
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,360
Well they can,
they can imitate all sorts of different

1702
01:10:08,361 --> 01:10:11,450
surfaces.
Coral and all sorts of different crazy

1703
01:10:11,451 --> 01:10:12,051
things.
And it's.

1704
01:10:12,051 --> 01:10:15,650
And what they'll do is they'll release
their cloud of ink and then what move.

1705
01:10:15,651 --> 01:10:18,560
But they'll just change shape.
So it looks like they vanished like a

1706
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:19,430
super villain.
Yeah.

1707
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:21,320
Yeah.
Well they think that that's like the.

1708
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,160
There was one speculation that that
blast of ink that they shoot out is

1709
01:10:25,161 --> 01:10:28,190
almost like the like correction fluid,
like white out.

1710
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:29,180
Like those are,
that's not what I meant.

1711
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:31,820
Like oh wow.
That they do it to each other,

1712
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:35,720
like to like to stop conversations and
that part of what they're doing when

1713
01:10:35,721 --> 01:10:39,130
they're changing their body is like a
visual form of communication that will.

1714
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:40,940
They definitely do like the,
like chameleons.

1715
01:10:40,941 --> 01:10:42,470
Also.
Communities don't always change color

1716
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,600
for evolution.
They'll do it for protection.

1717
01:10:44,601 --> 01:10:47,150
They'll become red show anger and its
mood.

1718
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:50,030
Like a lot of fish.
I've had changed color based on mood to

1719
01:10:50,031 --> 01:10:51,440
communicate.
It's fascinating.

1720
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:54,680
Mood fish like mood rings,
better mood rings.

1721
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,190
Well it's good because some fish when
they are the water's dirty,

1722
01:10:58,191 --> 01:11:00,530
they'll be a different color.
So you'll know it's time for water

1723
01:11:00,531 --> 01:11:01,640
change.
The catfish did that.

1724
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:02,630
Oh,
when they look sick,

1725
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:03,920
you know,
they just get darker.

1726
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:06,920
Oh just not good.
It's just dusky or it's like,

1727
01:11:06,921 --> 01:11:08,870
all right,
I need to make him lemonade colored

1728
01:11:08,871 --> 01:11:09,860
again.
Oh Wow.

1729
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:12,830
Yeah.
I thought that when they put an octopus

1730
01:11:12,831 --> 01:11:13,940
on checkerboard that did

1731
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:16,410
mimic the checkerboard,
it couldn't figure it couldn't get it

1732
01:11:16,411 --> 01:11:17,820
right.
Can you find that?

1733
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:19,230
That was confusing to me.
They did.

1734
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,560
There was something similar to that.
Maybe some sort of a striped pattern

1735
01:11:22,561 --> 01:11:24,750
that it mimicked the strife steak I
think they can do,

1736
01:11:24,751 --> 01:11:27,090
but the checker boards the problem,
if I remember correctly.

1737
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:30,260
So what are the best one is the
flamboyant cuttlefish.

1738
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,760
They just discovered it's two inches
long walks,

1739
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,560
but it's colored like a,
like a.

1740
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:37,620
it's like an acid trip and they're just
fascinating.

1741
01:11:37,621 --> 01:11:38,640
Look,
flamboyant.

1742
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,630
That's the official name.
Flamboyant cuttlefish.

1743
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:44,550
Isn't it true that they've only,
they've only researched like 10 percent

1744
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:45,720
of the ocean floor.
Oh yeah.

1745
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:46,583
It's insane.
That's,

1746
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:49,860
I mean that's my friend came up with the
name God's mistakes because God made

1747
01:11:49,861 --> 01:11:50,694
some fish.
He's like,

1748
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:52,020
well no one's gonna.
See that.

1749
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:54,630
They're just throwing the in the ocean
because they all look like monsters.

1750
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:57,090
And I.
my theory is because there's no light

1751
01:11:57,091 --> 01:12:00,600
down there that things like visuals
which are based on mathematics don't

1752
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:02,370
apply,
so it's okay that they're hideous

1753
01:12:02,371 --> 01:12:03,420
because no one's going to be seeing
them.

1754
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,380
What about bioluminescent fish and
phosphorescent ones?

1755
01:12:06,381 --> 01:12:08,130
Yeah.
There's weird ones that they create

1756
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:09,540
their own light bulbs.
They all have.

1757
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:12,780
They almost all have them.
There's one which uses red light because

1758
01:12:12,781 --> 01:12:15,370
others can't see red and they use them
like search lights.

1759
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,180
Oh yeah.
There's so much crazy shit.

1760
01:12:18,181 --> 01:12:20,520
The bottom of the sea.
It's so fascinating.

1761
01:12:20,521 --> 01:12:22,470
I mean,
if we found what's really fascinating to

1762
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:25,560
me is if we found any of this stuff in
space,

1763
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:29,340
we'd be freaking out.
This is why I never could like star trek

1764
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:34,410
because it drove me crazy as an autistic
young boy are you autistic,

1765
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:38,700
but for this purpose I am that I would
know all these zoological animals that

1766
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:40,080
look like insane things.

1767
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:41,880
Walking back fish,
which you can't swim,

1768
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:45,140
and then I turned on Star Trek.
It's another planet and it's a guy with

1769
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:49,560
fucking blue skin and like
I can get blue skin.

1770
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,290
Show me something that's not based on
the human form.

1771
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:56,260
You fucking ass each all the job is.
Here's the octopus cuttlefish,

1772
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:58,620
cuttlefish octopus,
Java.

1773
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:01,440
The Hudson was what blew my mind as a
kid because they look like aliens.

1774
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,690
Well,
my favorite one was that stupid lizard

1775
01:13:03,691 --> 01:13:06,270
guy that Captain Kirk had a fight with.
Oh God,

1776
01:13:06,271 --> 01:13:08,460
I remember that one.
I never watched star trek for this

1777
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:09,390
reason.
I'm not even joking.

1778
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:11,160
It's so bad.
Okay,

1779
01:13:11,161 --> 01:13:14,970
so here's the cuttlefish.
He's on the ground and there's a like a

1780
01:13:14,971 --> 01:13:17,220
sandy bottom,
and he kind of looks like the sandy

1781
01:13:17,221 --> 01:13:20,300
bottom and then they put this at the
beginning.

1782
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,550
It took it off so could switch back.
The Best I did was that little block.

1783
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:24,790
Wow.
That's pretty impressive.

1784
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:27,210
If we fucking close,
you did its best,

1785
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:30,120
but how did it know?
The eyes are on the side,

1786
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:31,830
so they're looking at an old directions
at once,

1787
01:13:31,831 --> 01:13:33,040
like a rabbit or.
But as a no,

1788
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,440
to make a square.
Right?

1789
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:36,360
What the fuck?
Look what it's doing it right there.

1790
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:38,250
It's kind of Holy Shit.
That's creepy.

1791
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:41,340
Wow.
Jesus Christ.

1792
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:43,860
Look a flamboyant cuttlefish.
You got to see this shit.

1793
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,520
It's toxic as hell to these animals.
I mean,

1794
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:51,660
what caused them to evolve like this and
they've been around forever.

1795
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,670
Forever and they also have very short
lifespans.

1796
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,400
Yeah.
So it's not even working.

1797
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,100
What keeps you alive?
How long week

1798
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,940
look like,
God,

1799
01:14:02,941 --> 01:14:05,280
this is insane.
Holy Shit.

1800
01:14:05,281 --> 01:14:07,530
I'm tripping.
And those always are it.

1801
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,000
It's not the.
It's not the water.

1802
01:14:09,001 --> 01:14:10,620
It's making it look like there's a wave
of skin.

1803
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:14,830
Wow.
Look at us eyes too,

1804
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,620
right?
Because they're the first ones.

1805
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:19,600
They found that walk.
It looks like a tiny water.

1806
01:14:19,601 --> 01:14:22,480
Hippo is that lady.
She's cute and she just wants to know.

1807
01:14:22,481 --> 01:14:25,060
She's cute.
Look at that thing.

1808
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:26,470
My God.
Amazing.

1809
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:31,150
That is amazing.
And I think that's hypnotic.

1810
01:14:31,151 --> 01:14:32,670
It's meant to be hypnotic.
Lucky break up.

1811
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:33,663
Oh,
look at that.

1812
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,191
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1813
01:14:34,191 --> 01:14:39,191
You look at it and it shoots this
fucking alien thing like the Ridley

1814
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:42,100
Scott Alien.
Find them out the second time now and

1815
01:14:42,101 --> 01:14:47,101
jabs at fish fuckin a man.
Like if we found that on Jupiter or rice

1816
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,880
or something like we'll be freaking out.
It's two inches.

1817
01:14:51,881 --> 01:14:53,190
You're like,
what the fuck is this shit?

1818
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:53,591
Yeah.
I mean,

1819
01:14:53,591 --> 01:14:55,810
if this was anywhere,
if they found this,

1820
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:58,240
you know,
pick a pick a planet in our solar

1821
01:14:58,241 --> 01:15:00,790
system,
we would be so obsessed with it.

1822
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:02,290
But the fact that it's in the ocean,
like,

1823
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:03,124
yeah,
it's right over there.

1824
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:06,820
Who gives a fuck?
I just found it pretty recently to

1825
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:08,223
really.
Yeah.

1826
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:13,450
I think in the nineties there was a
website that was dedicated to a bunch of

1827
01:15:13,451 --> 01:15:16,510
animals that were uncovered during one
of the tsunamis.

1828
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:19,540
I think it was the big tsunami that hit.
Was it Vietnam or Thailand?

1829
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:21,360
Oh,
was it

1830
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:23,500
somewhere?
Yeah,

1831
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:27,610
but there was a,
I think now that I'm saying is I feel

1832
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:29,410
like it was debunked.
Like someone said,

1833
01:15:29,411 --> 01:15:30,550
no,
that's not where they came from,

1834
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:35,580
but it was a series of super bizarre
animals that were found super bizarre

1835
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:39,910
fish they found at the bottom of the
ocean that literally looked like they

1836
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:41,500
came from another world.
Look up.

1837
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,780
There's something called a uh,
um,

1838
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:47,920
mouse trap fish where it's now,
it's like a mouse trap.

1839
01:15:47,921 --> 01:15:50,000
It's hinged and it,
it,

1840
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:51,320
it works like a mouse trap.

1841
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:52,530
Well,
how about the anglerfish?

1842
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,550
He's got a fishing pole hanging off his
fucking head.

1843
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:55,091
Well,
I had.

1844
01:15:55,091 --> 01:15:57,730
There's a bunch of different kinds of
angler fishes and the best,

1845
01:15:57,731 --> 01:15:59,290
there's one called the clown angler
fish,

1846
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:01,540
which has warts all over it and they're
very brightly colored.

1847
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,200
And this they to do Jamie.
This one,

1848
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:07,090
I'm sorry.
We're almost asking them too many things

1849
01:16:07,091 --> 01:16:08,230
to google.
Just one thing.

1850
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,420
This is the one they'll blow your
fucking mind.

1851
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:13,420
The football fish.
And what's amazing about them is the

1852
01:16:13,421 --> 01:16:16,720
females are like a yard,
but the males are two inches long and

1853
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:20,110
the males attached the females and lose
their sense of identity becomes sperm

1854
01:16:20,111 --> 01:16:21,010
glands.
Oh look,

1855
01:16:21,011 --> 01:16:23,890
regular dudes.
That's amazing.

1856
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:25,130
Yeah.
So they,

1857
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,460
they couldn't figure out where the males
were for a long time.

1858
01:16:27,461 --> 01:16:29,170
The female said just these growths on
them.

1859
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,380
And they were male.
They were the males Angler anglerfish.

1860
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:35,020
Well crazy.
The football fish.

1861
01:16:35,021 --> 01:16:36,580
And I typed it in.
So,

1862
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,820
but,
but he's tricking backwards with that

1863
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:41,350
photograph,
but there's one with the dangle it

1864
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:44,050
dangles if that's as a female.
So she dangles it in.

1865
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:45,790
Yeah.
That's looked at that they dangled over

1866
01:16:45,791 --> 01:16:46,420
there.
And then the other,

1867
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,380
Hey,
what's going on over here?

1868
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,500
And inhale.
Some

1869
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,850
definitely you just missed the teeth on
that fucking thing.

1870
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,970
And some of them have outside the mouth.
Those are the OBC anglers.

1871
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:03,340
Go back to Jamie,
the name that's the family Holo fry,

1872
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,530
California Day.
That's the family,

1873
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,410
the family of Angler fish.
And there's a bunch of families to them.

1874
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:10,040
Wow.
Look at that thing.

1875
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:11,330
God,
there's so many of them.

1876
01:17:11,331 --> 01:17:14,480
How many Angler fish are there?
Look at the one that tank show that one,

1877
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:15,343
that one,
that one.

1878
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:17,120
They have one in display.
Look at that.

1879
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,650
Hold our creep.
Yeah.

1880
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:22,040
I mean that doesn't even look like a
real thing.

1881
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,870
Right?
Wow.

1882
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:27,250
It's an amazing look at that one.
That one's bio luminescence?

1883
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,580
Yeah.
You could see where the spots are.

1884
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,080
Ah,
that's beautiful.

1885
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:32,060
Yeah.
And they can't keep them in a cramped.

1886
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:34,370
What is that called?
It's also anti football fish.

1887
01:17:34,371 --> 01:17:35,430
Go back,
go back to.

1888
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,300
So what do you get add over there?
Uh,

1889
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:39,203
Atlantic.

1890
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,070
Look at that thing.
Oh yeah.

1891
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:46,700
The colors in that thing.
And it looks like it's bolted together.

1892
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:48,260
Oh yeah.
It looks like patchwork.

1893
01:17:48,261 --> 01:17:50,120
Like some sort of an animated movie
there.

1894
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:54,440
There's the deep sea is my favorite kind
of stuff with all this crazy shit.

1895
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:57,230
But what's the most underappreciated and
overlooked?

1896
01:17:57,231 --> 01:17:58,670
Go to that one.
That's up right above that,

1897
01:17:58,671 --> 01:18:00,050
Jamie.
The one.

1898
01:18:00,051 --> 01:18:00,884
Yeah,
right there.

1899
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:02,780
What does that one?
Yeah,

1900
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:06,770
they're all.
Do you want to see something real thing,

1901
01:18:06,771 --> 01:18:07,604
man,
that's,

1902
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:10,030
that does not look real.
Yeah.

1903
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,900
God,
these things are amazing.

1904
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:12,973
Look up,
um,

1905
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,490
red lipped walking batfish fish because
there's one that's a relative of this.

1906
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:18,890
There wears lipstick.
Walking,

1907
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,560
walking back fish.
Wow.

1908
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:26,990
Why in the fuck is that thing?
They can't swim.

1909
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:28,410
So they.
Yeah,

1910
01:18:28,990 --> 01:18:32,410
they have a nose and out of the nose is
where the angle comes from.

1911
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:34,700
That's my favorite fish.

1912
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:36,890
Look at that shit.
Oh my God.

1913
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:38,660
Look at the lips.
Yeah.

1914
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:41,810
Wow.
Isn't that amazing?

1915
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,360
Yeah.
They're like,

1916
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:46,040
they're very hard to keep in captivity
to species because they always have

1917
01:18:46,041 --> 01:18:47,330
parasites.
Oh,

1918
01:18:47,331 --> 01:18:48,164
is that why?
Yeah.

1919
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,270
Why can't they keep great whites in
captivity?

1920
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:55,650
Because a great whites are extremely
sensitive to electric impulses in the

1921
01:18:55,761 --> 01:18:57,470
water,
so they keep banging their heads against

1922
01:18:57,471 --> 01:18:59,720
the wall,
plus their pelagic,

1923
01:18:59,721 --> 01:19:01,850
which means they live in the ocean where
there's nothing around them,

1924
01:19:01,851 --> 01:19:04,880
so they're not used to any barriers,
so this really fucks them up.

1925
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:07,070
They need to be able to go full speed
for miles at a time.

1926
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,390
Oh Wow.
Yeah,

1927
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:10,880
that's interesting.
They got a whale sharks in captivity

1928
01:19:10,881 --> 01:19:13,940
that Georgia,
and they've got three in Georgia and

1929
01:19:13,941 --> 01:19:15,410
Atlanta.
How big is the tank?

1930
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,630
It's Jack gets the biggest tank in the
world,

1931
01:19:17,631 --> 01:19:18,441
or second biggest.
Yeah,

1932
01:19:18,441 --> 01:19:20,330
the glass was like two feet thick,
so the crazy.

1933
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:24,350
So it seems stupid to keep them
go,

1934
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:25,700
go see them in the ocean,
man,

1935
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:27,180
Philippines for them.
The Great.

1936
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:30,330
Then watch them on video just seems
fucked up to me.

1937
01:19:30,331 --> 01:19:33,620
To keep those things in captivity just
doesn't make any sense.

1938
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:35,570
They're there.
Yeah,

1939
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:36,643
I guess.
Yeah.

1940
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:37,581
Awesome.
Great.

1941
01:19:37,581 --> 01:19:39,620
If you could talk to them,
you know,

1942
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:42,740
probably be like prisoners,
like super bummed out.

1943
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,330
It's just like North Korea,
but for fish.

1944
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:45,500
Well,
I used to have a joke about that,

1945
01:19:45,501 --> 01:19:47,540
about like someone like saying like,
hey man,

1946
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:48,830
you know,
things that bad.

1947
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:51,230
I went to the zoo,
I saw these chimps playing with a rope

1948
01:19:51,231 --> 01:19:52,370
and they look,
they're having a good time.

1949
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,180
I go,
yeah,

1950
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,520
go to prison.
You Watch dudes playing basketball.

1951
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:56,840
Doesn't mean it's awesome.
Right,

1952
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:58,530
right.
Especially with the higher end in prison

1953
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,630
that are intelligent.
Yeah.

1954
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:01,580
Yeah.
It's like if people have pets were

1955
01:20:01,581 --> 01:20:02,000
birds.

1956
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,740
I don't.
I'm a big pet person,

1957
01:20:03,741 --> 01:20:06,560
but the bird wants to be flying around.
Yeah.

1958
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:08,610
Like when they clip their wings.
Now you don't need these.

1959
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,650
Yeah.
I needed to keep you around.

1960
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,600
Yeah.
The only thing that makes you special

1961
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:16,530
and I want to say hello.
Let me clip your wings.

1962
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:17,850
Yeah,
it is.

1963
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:19,020
I don't know,
we're weird.

1964
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:21,180
We're weird with our dominance over
other animals,

1965
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,440
but I mean I guess every animal that has
control over their animals is weird.

1966
01:20:25,441 --> 01:20:26,970
Like if you've seen that thing about
dolphins,

1967
01:20:26,971 --> 01:20:28,740
they take puffer fish and they get high
with them,

1968
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:30,330
they pass them around.
What?

1969
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:32,250
I killer whales,
they kill babies for fun.

1970
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,360
Oh yeah.
They have a good time.

1971
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:35,340
They're sick.
Well yeah.

1972
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,020
It will.
Dolphins do the exact same thing that

1973
01:20:37,021 --> 01:20:39,210
you were talking about.
The cats do where they kill off the,

1974
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:43,410
the young to make the female breed
because a female dolphin won't go into

1975
01:20:43,411 --> 01:20:44,244
breeding.

1976
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:47,400
I think it's like six or seven years
while she was raising the kid.

1977
01:20:47,401 --> 01:20:48,234
Okay.
Yeah.

1978
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:53,070
So one of the things that females do to
mitigate this is they fuck as many males

1979
01:20:53,071 --> 01:20:56,550
as they can because they obviously they
don't have Maury Povich and DNA tests

1980
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,930
and the ocean.
So they fuck is.

1981
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:02,830
They're like extremely promiscuous.
And the idea behind it,

1982
01:21:02,831 --> 01:21:07,080
if they fuck enough of these males,
the guy will have no idea whose baby is

1983
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,650
so think it's his baby fuck to you.
That might be my kid.

1984
01:21:10,651 --> 01:21:11,484
All right.
I'm not going to eat them.

1985
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,890
My knowledge if the C is just limited to
fish.

1986
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,520
So let's get some novelists.
I'm looking,

1987
01:21:15,521 --> 01:21:17,880
I've kind of like c student,
but you're a Dork,

1988
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:19,870
like you really love it.
I'm a Dork.

1989
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:23,230
Uh,
all different kinds of species.

1990
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,670
I can rattle off things all day,
like every.

1991
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,360
What do you think about the Tasmanian
Tiger?

1992
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:32,360
Do you think that things alive that day?
They're thinking of trying to clone it

1993
01:21:32,611 --> 01:21:34,320
back because they have ones in
Formaldehyde,

1994
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:35,213
do they?
Yeah.

1995
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:37,260
So it died out in the twenties,
I believe.

1996
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:39,990
Uh,
I think it's somewhere around there and

1997
01:21:39,991 --> 01:21:41,330
because we have video of it,
yes.

1998
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:44,460
One in captivity and they are thinking
of trying to clone it and bring it back.

1999
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:45,780
I didn't know that.
There it is right there.

2000
01:21:45,781 --> 01:21:47,790
What a great is fabulous.
It's the only animal that can open.

2001
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:49,950
It's not like 120 degrees or something.
Well,

2002
01:21:49,951 --> 01:21:53,970
they think that they might have a few of
them still in the wild because Australia

2003
01:21:53,971 --> 01:21:56,610
is essentially the size of the
contiguous United States,

2004
01:21:56,611 --> 01:22:00,300
but with the same amount of people in
Los Angeles and they think that it might

2005
01:22:00,301 --> 01:22:03,060
be possible because there's been several
sightings at these things,

2006
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,340
but then you gotta think there's several
sightings and bigfoot.

2007
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:07,350
I love cryptozoology.
It's.

2008
01:22:07,351 --> 01:22:10,090
It's just absolutely fascinating because
even the coloration looks like they'll

2009
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:13,320
copy which is the giraffes closest
relative and they thought that was fake

2010
01:22:13,321 --> 01:22:16,740
and then they found one another in zoos.
You could see it's a crazy looking at

2011
01:22:16,741 --> 01:22:17,430
them.
Yeah,

2012
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:21,510
but do you think that that thing is.
I mean there's enough sightings where

2013
01:22:21,511 --> 01:22:25,920
they're starting to actively consider.
There was a a movie with what the Fuck

2014
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,600
Willem defoe several years ago where
someone had hired him to go and shoot a

2015
01:22:30,601 --> 01:22:35,601
Tasmanian Tiger that they knew were one
was and that somebody wanted it to stuff

2016
01:22:35,641 --> 01:22:40,200
at or something like that.
There was this species of insect on St

2017
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,550
Helena Island,
I think it was where they thought it was

2018
01:22:41,551 --> 01:22:44,730
extinct or they found a bush.
There had 13 of them and now they bred

2019
01:22:44,731 --> 01:22:48,270
them and there's like thousands,
so if they found one it would be great

2020
01:22:48,271 --> 01:22:50,670
because they'd be able to breed them to
huge numbers pretty quickly.

2021
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:52,680
Also,
it's like one of the last predators

2022
01:22:52,681 --> 01:22:54,520
other than like saltwater crocodiles,
right?

2023
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:55,830
In Australia.
Yeah,

2024
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:56,740
yeah,
yeah.

2025
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:59,310
The dingoes no joke there.
They've been taken out a lot of stuff.

2026
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,930
They have that whole dingo fence for
that reason.

2027
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:02,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

2028
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,650
Australia is a really weird place,
man.

2029
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,100
Some of mine were just over there.

2030
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:08,100
They were hunting water buffaloes.
Oh,

2031
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:10,450
it was Asian water buffaloes.
Huge,

2032
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,540
huge.
And also an invasive species.

2033
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:17,620
So these things come over and they just
destroy the water like anything else.

2034
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:22,650
That truck 2000 plus millions and they
just shit everywhere and ruin all the

2035
01:23:24,521 --> 01:23:26,050
water sources.
So all these birds,

2036
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:28,810
all these different animals that need
that water all getting fucked up and

2037
01:23:28,811 --> 01:23:30,430
dying.
Did you ever see one when it took out

2038
01:23:30,431 --> 01:23:33,250
the lion?
I did see something like that recently.

2039
01:23:33,251 --> 01:23:33,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

2040
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:35,270
Where there's like a Cape Buffalo.
Yeah,

2041
01:23:35,271 --> 01:23:35,660
yeah,
yeah,

2042
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,180
yeah.
It's just the macy says kill.

2043
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,300
It just swings at end of the line,
goes flying like 20 feet.

2044
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,790
Have you ever seen the documentary
relentless enemies?

2045
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,820
No.
It's fascinating.

2046
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:49,990
It's so good because it's about these
lines that adapted to only eat water

2047
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:53,830
buffalo.
What happened was they had a change in

2048
01:23:53,831 --> 01:23:56,860
the current of the river,
changed the course of a river and an

2049
01:23:56,861 --> 01:24:01,861
isolated this one island of lions and
they only had two things to eat and one

2050
01:24:02,711 --> 01:24:05,440
of the things was Cape Buffalo,
which are fucking enormous,

2051
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:09,220
so these lions became freakish mutan
lions,

2052
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,970
enormous lions,
like the average female is the size of

2053
01:24:12,971 --> 01:24:15,430
an average male,
La and everywhere else in Africa,

2054
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
but google relentless enemies,
giant killer lions because the females

2055
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:22,510
don't even look real.

2056
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:25,450
They look like hulk lions.
They're fucking Jack.

2057
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:28,240
This is another reason I'm very
skeptical about this climate change

2058
01:24:28,241 --> 01:24:31,180
stuff because nature is far more
adaptable than we give it credit for.

2059
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,290
Oh,
you mean climate change in that?

2060
01:24:32,291 --> 01:24:35,110
Like the doom and gloom.
Like if the temperature is that one

2061
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:38,080
degree that the corals can't handle it.
I don't buy it will move to Canada,

2062
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,210
Canada.
I love it.

2063
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:42,020
I love Canada.
I love Toronto,

2064
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:44,500
see if you get these.
These are the ones going after it,

2065
01:24:44,501 --> 01:24:48,610
but see if you can get an image of some
of the lions from relentless enemies

2066
01:24:48,611 --> 01:24:51,430
because they're just get.
Just Google it.

2067
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:54,130
Go and look.
Don't just keep popping these up on the

2068
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:57,310
screen because there's some of them.
If you go and look and find it,

2069
01:24:57,311 --> 01:25:01,210
you can find ones that are just jacked.
That's relentless enemies.

2070
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:03,100
Yeah,
but see if you can find like a good

2071
01:25:03,101 --> 01:25:06,700
image of the lives
right next to it.

2072
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:07,481
That one?
Yeah,

2073
01:25:07,481 --> 01:25:08,730
that one.
No,

2074
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:09,490
it's not.
They're good.

2075
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:11,870
There's some really good ones.
There's some really good ones where they

2076
01:25:11,871 --> 01:25:14,620
look freakish.
There's a good look at the size of that

2077
01:25:14,621 --> 01:25:18,190
fucker like that is so much bigger than
the average female lion.

2078
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,050
That's crazy.
It's because they're.

2079
01:25:20,051 --> 01:25:22,000
All they're eating is east cape
buffaloes.

2080
01:25:22,001 --> 01:25:26,230
He's fucking enormous buffalo's so
they've grown to like 600 pounds for the

2081
01:25:26,231 --> 01:25:29,140
average female lion there are much
bigger.

2082
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:30,301
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2083
01:25:30,301 --> 01:25:31,570
They're huge.
They're.

2084
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:34,990
They look so huge that even look real
and they still even this big.

2085
01:25:34,991 --> 01:25:37,030
They have to gang up on him.
Of course,

2086
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:40,330
jump on their back and one of them jumps
on the leg and I mean it's just.

2087
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:43,540
But the documentary is amazing and
interestingly enough,

2088
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:48,490
there's several prides of lion on this
one island and then not all that big.

2089
01:25:48,491 --> 01:25:52,180
It's just one pride is that big.
The other prides are like fairly normal

2090
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:53,960
sized,
but one pride has.

2091
01:25:53,961 --> 01:25:57,820
It's just freakishly large species of
lion.

2092
01:25:58,150 --> 01:25:59,980
You know,
I ran through a lot of scenarios,

2093
01:25:59,981 --> 01:26:01,240
but what we're going to be talking
today,

2094
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:03,890
and this was not one of them,
I didn't went

2095
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:07,490
through any scenarios.
I mean I knew we were going to talk.

2096
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,010
We're sure about North Korea,
but I didn't know.

2097
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:13,610
We're going to talk about giant lines or
psychedelic cuddle fish.

2098
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,230
What's it called again?
Flamboyant.

2099
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,030
Flamboyant cuttlefish.
What a perfect name.

2100
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:18,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

2101
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,990
Why do they always use these fucking
Latin names?

2102
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:23,330
Because that way,
and this happens with when you into

2103
01:26:23,331 --> 01:26:25,160
aquariums,
if I'm sending you something from

2104
01:26:25,161 --> 01:26:27,200
England to America or England to
Cambodia,

2105
01:26:27,201 --> 01:26:29,300
you know,
we're speaking the exact same species

2106
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:32,570
because what you might call a gray
parrot is not the same as what I would

2107
01:26:32,571 --> 01:26:34,820
call a great parent.
That makes sense.

2108
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,040
That's interesting that he chose a dead
language.

2109
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,510
Well,
that way it's universal.

2110
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:41,120
Right?
That makes sense.

2111
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,490
Why don't just use English since we kick
ass?

2112
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:46,940
Because
America

2113
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:52,580
speak American and world American.
I'm sorry,

2114
01:26:52,581 --> 01:26:55,200
those America.
We've got a by England in this.

2115
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:58,310
Just take over that.
That name of the language.

2116
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,770
Keep calling it English like enough
already.

2117
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:02,320
You guys wouldn't be it,
right?

2118
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:05,570
You guys speak wrong and he spelled
tires wrong too.

2119
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:09,680
I really think that they've evolved that
accent to come off as smarter than they

2120
01:27:09,681 --> 01:27:11,750
really are.
I think Americans are smarter than

2121
01:27:11,751 --> 01:27:14,820
British people and it's a big lie.
That's rude.

2122
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:17,090
You're racist against who?
The British?

2123
01:27:17,091 --> 01:27:18,770
Yes are.
They're all ugly.

2124
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:20,090
So.
Oh,

2125
01:27:20,091 --> 01:27:23,060
how dare you have not seen a sporty
spice?

2126
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:25,330
She isn't she the hot one was the hot
one.

2127
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:26,420
Boy,
it's pretty hot.

2128
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:29,660
She's American and I decided the hot
ones are American,

2129
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:32,900
but the thing is,
it's when you hear British people talk,

2130
01:27:32,901 --> 01:27:35,510
you think they're smart and you talk to
them like you're not that fucking smart.

2131
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,090
You just stood accent Guy Ritchie's
really fucking smart.

2132
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:39,470
Well,
he's one data point.

2133
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:42,560
Madonna,
you're trolling.

2134
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:43,321
I see what you're doing.
Wait,

2135
01:27:43,321 --> 01:27:43,850
wait.
You wait.

2136
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:46,160
You read a lot of people from America
and English.

2137
01:27:46,161 --> 01:27:48,350
Do you think English people generally
smarter than Americans?

2138
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:51,050
I think that people vary widely.

2139
01:27:53,130 --> 01:27:55,100
Okay,
but you could still do a lot of really

2140
01:27:55,101 --> 01:27:56,720
dumb American people.
Of course,

2141
01:27:56,721 --> 01:27:59,510
a lot of really dumb American beat,
but I think there's a lot of really dumb

2142
01:27:59,511 --> 01:28:00,530
British people.
I'm sure.

2143
01:28:00,670 --> 01:28:01,550
Yeah,
I'm sure.

2144
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,770
I never met him.
Everyone I met as a genius from England.

2145
01:28:03,771 --> 01:28:04,730
Everyone,
all of them.

2146
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:08,180
Oh fuck that guy.
Ritchie and sporty spice.

2147
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:11,390
Sporty guy.
Ritchie.

2148
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,590
Well,
you haven't.

2149
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,080
Madonna,
and she's a genius listener of Madonna's

2150
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:16,330
English now.
Gave them.

2151
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,830
We gave her away.
I mean the idea that you can with a

2152
01:28:18,831 --> 01:28:21,210
straight face just put makeup,
a British accent.

2153
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,470
You got to realize the kind of Dick that
Guy Ritchie was slinging.

2154
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:30,020
He fucked her up so bad that she doesn't
work anymore and she speaks English.

2155
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:34,700
She barely even saying that is.
That is stigmatized if I've ever seen

2156
01:28:34,701 --> 01:28:37,640
it.
He's just laying that fucking lock stock

2157
01:28:37,641 --> 01:28:39,350
and two smoking barrels.
Are they.

2158
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,460
Are they.
They're divorced though,

2159
01:28:40,461 --> 01:28:40,870
right?
Yeah,

2160
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:41,511
yeah.
Yeah.

2161
01:28:41,511 --> 01:28:43,760
But she's still fucked up from it.
She was really fucked up.

2162
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:46,220
He's recovered greatly,
but she's really like,

2163
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:47,660
really?
She's a mess.

2164
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:50,270
She's got like those tweety birds for
cartoons

2165
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:57,200
was
the universal thing for somebody fucked

2166
01:28:57,201 --> 01:28:58,560
up.
Birds would circled it.

2167
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:04,740
How did we know what they meant?
Like someone got clocked over the head

2168
01:29:04,741 --> 01:29:06,660
with a frying pan and we'd see those
birds.

2169
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:07,300
Tweet,
tweet,

2170
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,133
tweet,
tweet,

2171
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:10,470
and where are you going to?
Yeah.

2172
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,710
That got fucked up and I think she's got
a mix of those birds and cuckoo clocks.

2173
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:16,020
Yeah.
Well it's got to be hard,

2174
01:29:16,021 --> 01:29:18,450
man.
When you're like a sex symbol for women

2175
01:29:18,451 --> 01:29:21,720
is like,
there's this weird phase that women go

2176
01:29:21,721 --> 01:29:23,550
through,
which is very disturbing.

2177
01:29:23,551 --> 01:29:25,230
Everyone except Christie Brinkley who
had still.

2178
01:29:25,231 --> 01:29:26,280
Fuck,
sorry.

2179
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:27,960
Sorry.
No disrespect,

2180
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:30,540
but she's like in her sixties,
she's still hot,

2181
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:33,180
but every other woman who's like really
hot,

2182
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:36,840
when she was in her twenties,
they get to this certain age and either

2183
01:29:36,841 --> 01:29:41,841
they let it go like Meryl Streep and
just accept an age gracefully or they

2184
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:45,590
start shooting a bunch of shit in my
face and they get real weird looking.

2185
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,900
Right?
Or they just become like a monster and

2186
01:29:48,901 --> 01:29:53,550
so they go from being extremely
desirable to repulsive the uncanny

2187
01:29:53,551 --> 01:29:55,770
valley,
the Uncanny Valley of deals with

2188
01:29:55,771 --> 01:29:58,200
software,
but it deals with like when robots look

2189
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,120
too close to human beings,
it's repulsive,

2190
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:02,420
right?
Artificial intelligence,

2191
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:05,010
what they use artificial.
I'm a virtual reality.

2192
01:30:05,011 --> 01:30:06,990
Right?
But the point is someone has to look

2193
01:30:06,991 --> 01:30:08,880
like a person,
but not too much like a person who has

2194
01:30:08,881 --> 01:30:10,350
this creepy.
So they become like,

2195
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:11,880
you look human almost.
Right.

2196
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:13,920
So then it becomes very repellent.
Yeah,

2197
01:30:13,921 --> 01:30:16,410
that's what's.
That's what's tweaky about.

2198
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:21,030
We went to Nvidia a few years back when
I was doing this Scifi show and this

2199
01:30:21,031 --> 01:30:25,290
was,
I want to say 2012 or 13 where they were

2200
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:30,320
just getting good at this virtual
reality software and the reproduction of

2201
01:30:31,021 --> 01:30:32,790
the human body,
but they couldn't get eyelashes

2202
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:33,643
downright.
Oh,

2203
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,080
like blinking.
It was weird like that.

2204
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,140
So you'd watched this guy,
Tom,

2205
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:40,200
like there was something weird about the
blinking,

2206
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:43,440
trying to give you a message and code.
Fucking bizarre.

2207
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:46,720
Like wasn't there some Vietnam hostage?
American POW.

2208
01:30:46,721 --> 01:30:47,910
It's blinking.
Sos.

2209
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,470
Oh yeah.
What was that?

2210
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:52,020
I think that's what I think it was that
POW two,

2211
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:52,621
three,
one,

2212
01:30:52,621 --> 01:30:53,180
two,
three.

2213
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:55,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

2214
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:57,360
They'd probably killed him.
Yeah,

2215
01:30:57,690 --> 01:30:59,250
they,
I mean the Americans that the Koreans

2216
01:30:59,251 --> 01:31:02,580
had hostage did similar shit and they
got tortured be unbelief.

2217
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:04,440
While that was something I was reading
about China,

2218
01:31:04,441 --> 01:31:08,640
about how many CIA operatives in China
had been killed over the last two years?

2219
01:31:08,641 --> 01:31:09,910
Like 18.
Is that.

2220
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:10,720
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2221
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:15,720
18 different informants had been killed
or jailed over the last couple of years

2222
01:31:16,051 --> 01:31:19,680
and they were complaining we can.
We can't fucking spy on them anymore.

2223
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:20,543
It's like,
hey,

2224
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,820
like they don't want you spying like to
get it,

2225
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,050
but with the way we look at it,
like we're allowed a spy.

2226
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:30,340
Like you can't be killing people.
That is.

2227
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:35,420
Yeah.
So they're interviewing him here.

2228
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:37,533
Can you hear it?

2229
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:41,680
Oh my,

2230
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,010
a I can't.

2231
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:52,740
I believe in.
I'm a member of that group.

2232
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:54,730
Whoa.
Yeah.

2233
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:57,940
Vietnam.
There's something entirely terrifying

2234
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:00,820
about watching someone who is a prisoner
of war.

2235
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:03,730
Oh yeah.
So when John Mccain has these racist

2236
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:05,380
quotes,
sometimes it's like,

2237
01:32:05,381 --> 01:32:06,540
you know what?
You get it pass.

2238
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:07,810
You can't even,
you,

2239
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:09,100
you're fine.
You can't lift your hands over your

2240
01:32:09,101 --> 01:32:09,610
head.
You're,

2241
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:10,780
you do whatever you say.
Whatever you want.

2242
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:11,710
You've earned it.
Yeah.

2243
01:32:11,711 --> 01:32:12,760
He.
How does he get dressed?

2244
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:14,490
Like is he can only do this.
Yeah.

2245
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:16,650
Well that's because they broke his arm
data.

2246
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:17,471
Yeah,
like a shoulders.

2247
01:32:17,471 --> 01:32:19,830
I think they pulled them and kind of had
him hanging by his wrist.

2248
01:32:19,831 --> 01:32:22,450
I believe if it's just an still have and
you know,

2249
01:32:22,451 --> 01:32:24,430
he can't tie his tie and all this stuff.
It's like,

2250
01:32:24,431 --> 01:32:26,650
you know,
you can say you can use slurs.

2251
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:28,030
That's fine.
You're saying it's okay.

2252
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,750
I think for him,
you know,

2253
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:33,580
so it's just like,
yeah,

2254
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:34,960
get them some stem cells.

2255
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,810
Shit,
my mom listen to this shit.

2256
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:40,030
My Mom,
God bless her heart,

2257
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:45,420
started taking stem cells by which it
was plant stems in a pill form.

2258
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,470
Oh Jesus.
And I'm just like,

2259
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:48,270
I just,
I you.

2260
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:50,260
What do you say to that?
What did she think it was going to do to

2261
01:32:50,261 --> 01:32:51,330
her?
I mean,

2262
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:54,300
stem cells are good for your energy and
also what you said,

2263
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,290
I don't even fucking know I at that
point,

2264
01:32:56,291 --> 01:32:57,190
you're just like,
okay mom.

2265
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:01,450
Well they are,
they are a loophole.

2266
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:03,670
Go,
you're going to live forever.

2267
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:08,410
Wonder like if John Mccain's ever tried
to do anything about his shoulders or if

2268
01:33:08,411 --> 01:33:09,550
it's just like,
fuck it.

2269
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:13,600
I'm sure he did.
I mean I wonder this is decades at this

2270
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:15,820
point.
He's a fascinating character.

2271
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:18,610
Yeah.
He's a grumpy old dude and sometimes it

2272
01:33:18,611 --> 01:33:21,610
makes a whole lot of sense and a lot of
people will like totally down for him

2273
01:33:21,611 --> 01:33:22,890
being president and all of a sudden he
goes,

2274
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:24,520
Sarah Pailin running with them and
you're like,

2275
01:33:24,521 --> 01:33:25,440
what are you doing man?

2276
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,550
I'm like,
what the fuck is going on?

2277
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:32,760
That sort of unveiled the machinery
behind the Republicans and like what?

2278
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:39,070
What do you think America is like?
You think America is like some sort of

2279
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:44,350
weird reality show.
Some honey booboo type shit or this lady

2280
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:47,520
is should be one heartbeat away from
being the fucking president.

2281
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:48,700
When she came out,
she had,

2282
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:51,640
when she was nominated,
she had the highest approval rating of

2283
01:33:51,641 --> 01:33:54,420
any governor in America and her first
capitalist speeches.

2284
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:55,211
Everyone's like,
oh yeah,

2285
01:33:55,211 --> 01:33:57,520
this lady is a ball buster.
And then interview hit and you're like,

2286
01:33:57,521 --> 01:33:59,190
Holy Shit.
She doesn't read.

2287
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,010
She's.
She's.

2288
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:02,580
She's like had learning disabled.
Yeah.

2289
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:03,820
Well I don't know if she's learned to
say,

2290
01:34:03,821 --> 01:34:05,860
but I just don't think she's interested
in learning.

2291
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:09,550
I read her book and it was really
interesting.

2292
01:34:09,551 --> 01:34:12,100
Or You read her book.
There's only so many hours in a day.

2293
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:15,310
How many days in a week,
so many years in your life that can read

2294
01:34:15,311 --> 01:34:17,920
North Korean propaganda could read this
and there's this one point in the book

2295
01:34:17,921 --> 01:34:19,660
where I'm like,
her ghost writer should be fired because

2296
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:20,590
she,
her daughter,

2297
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,350
willow,
whatever goes to her,

2298
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,390
mommy,
why don't you ever cry?

2299
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,310
And I'm like,
this is a murder mystery.

2300
01:34:27,311 --> 01:34:30,100
That's how you know she's a sociopath
and it's in the book.

2301
01:34:30,101 --> 01:34:30,940
I'm like,
Holy Shit,

2302
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,040
that's terrifying.
Mommy's too dumb to cry.

2303
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:35,410
I don't think it's just,
Mommy's just don't understand sadness.

2304
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:38,140
It's just skin over wires and circuitry.
Oh Man.

2305
01:34:38,141 --> 01:34:39,520
See,
I didn't see that.

2306
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:42,670
I just saw her as being adored.
Well,

2307
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:44,590
like it came out.
I think there's,

2308
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:47,500
just like with George W Bush,
you remember the first 2000,

2309
01:34:47,570 --> 01:34:50,440
he won those debates against Gore,
or at least held his own and then there

2310
01:34:50,441 --> 01:34:52,720
was just declined to the point where
he's not even speak English.

2311
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:54,700
Well,
do you remember when George Bush was

2312
01:34:54,701 --> 01:34:56,290
running for Governor of Texas?
Now?

2313
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:56,980
I don't.
I mean,

2314
01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:58,100
I,
I wouldn't have noticed that I'm from

2315
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:58,791
New York.
Well,

2316
01:34:58,791 --> 01:35:00,950
um,
the reason why I remember is because

2317
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:05,260
they show the stark contrast between his
ability to communicate while he was

2318
01:35:05,261 --> 01:35:08,570
running for governor versus his ability
to communicate once it became president.

2319
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:14,140
I felt like he was almost like a guy who
had all his responsibility taken away

2320
01:35:14,841 --> 01:35:19,010
from him and he just like atrophied.
Like Dick Cheney was kinda running the

2321
01:35:19,011 --> 01:35:24,011
show and he was just sitting back
fucking up lines and making mistakes

2322
01:35:24,531 --> 01:35:27,200
with things.
But if you watch the speeches that he

2323
01:35:27,201 --> 01:35:28,880
gave,
a kid will play this

2324
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:34,230
a perspective.
I think that the mission in education

2325
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:36,270
and literature,
math,

2326
01:35:36,271 --> 01:35:40,560
science and social science,
it's still different to enrich beyond

2327
01:35:40,561 --> 01:35:41,670
that,
more power to them.

2328
01:35:41,671 --> 01:35:41,900
But yeah.

2329
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:42,980
Wow,
that's a different person.

2330
01:35:42,981 --> 01:35:44,370
We all know it gets better.

2331
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:47,180
Four subject matters and see if we can
do it right.

2332
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:51,200
We ought to determine the cost per pupil
necessary to achieve excellence in the

2333
01:35:51,201 --> 01:35:54,620
classroom.
And we all to funded the funding

2334
01:35:54,621 --> 01:35:58,100
priority of the state of Texas,
the school children of our state.

2335
01:35:58,101 --> 01:36:00,620
And it has not been under the past four
years.

2336
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:03,980
The state share of education has
decreased to 44 percent.

2337
01:36:04,490 --> 01:36:08,540
That is why we have property taxes on
the rise and nearly every single school

2338
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:09,210
district in

2339
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:10,043
stable

2340
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:14,090
defined the mission determine the cost
per pupil necessarily.

2341
01:36:14,190 --> 01:36:15,980
You see reading from the teleprompter
elected government.

2342
01:36:15,981 --> 01:36:16,700
No,
clearly not

2343
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:20,520
say that the number one funding priority
of our state will be the schoolchildren

2344
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:21,363
of Texas.

2345
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:25,060
Holy Shit.
Amazing and compare George Bush 10 years

2346
01:36:25,061 --> 01:36:28,060
ago to George Bush today,
now so that in the video it says this,

2347
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,993
listen to them now.

2348
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:34,550
Awesome
for dealing with nuclear proliferation,

2349
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:38,270
about 35 percent since I've been the
president.

2350
01:36:38,770 --> 01:36:39,650
Now.
Secondly,

2351
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:42,200
we set up what's called the.
Well first of all,

2352
01:36:42,201 --> 01:36:45,440
I agree with it.
My opponent that the biggest threat

2353
01:36:46,130 --> 01:36:49,040
facing this country is there a weapons
of mass destruction in the hands of a

2354
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:49,874
terrorist network.

2355
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,660
Yeah,
he was clear and concise,

2356
01:36:51,661 --> 01:36:54,320
but he was also a younger man.
You have to realize like,

2357
01:36:54,330 --> 01:36:58,890
this is an older man.
He's tired and the grind of being the

2358
01:36:58,891 --> 01:37:03,120
president for four years was wearing on
him so hard when he was running against

2359
01:37:03,121 --> 01:37:04,380
Kerry there.
I mean,

2360
01:37:04,381 --> 01:37:08,760
he was just a beaten man and I just
think that job is just unbelievably

2361
01:37:08,761 --> 01:37:11,730
draining,
like some sort of a psychic vampire just

2362
01:37:11,731 --> 01:37:15,450
locks onto you and saps you of all your
fucking Mitochondria.

2363
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:17,040
Well,
he doesn't have an excuse because his

2364
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:19,140
dad was president,
so he would have known what it's like

2365
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:21,810
maybe his dad was only president for
four years now only.

2366
01:37:21,811 --> 01:37:22,560
I mean,
come on.

2367
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,090
That's not going to be a short four
years.

2368
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:26,150
Yeah,
and his dad was the head of the CIA for

2369
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:28,920
that.
So his dad was maybe more deeply

2370
01:37:28,921 --> 01:37:31,560
entrenched in the ideas of politics than
he was.

2371
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:34,400
And I met his uncle.
I went to Gail with a friend of mine who

2372
01:37:34,401 --> 01:37:37,400
was doing a masters t and that guy I was
ready to go out,

2373
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:39,180
come out swinging.
I thought it was going to be a troll.

2374
01:37:39,210 --> 01:37:42,000
That guy charmed the fucking pants off
me and I'm like,

2375
01:37:42,001 --> 01:37:44,300
Holy Shit.
I can see why these people are in power

2376
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:46,500
one on one.
They are so charming,

2377
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,920
will win.
Jeb was running for president,

2378
01:37:48,930 --> 01:37:51,330
so I almost felt like he was thrown in
the towel.

2379
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:53,820
I felt like he was like,
I'm just going to go through the motions

2380
01:37:53,821 --> 01:37:56,130
and fuck some of this up.
Just like

2381
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:59,100
Rick Perry when Rick Perry was like.
And then there's something I forgot.

2382
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,120
Yeah,
I remember that.

2383
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:02,850
What about,
did you say Jeb Bush is tweet when he,

2384
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:04,050
when he,
when he quit,

2385
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:05,520
he said,
sorry mom.

2386
01:38:05,870 --> 01:38:07,860
That was his tweet.
Jabba tweeted this out.

2387
01:38:07,861 --> 01:38:09,000
Yes.
Wow.

2388
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:10,830
His mom's probably secretly happy.
Well,

2389
01:38:10,831 --> 01:38:12,270
she,
she didn't want him to run Barbara.

2390
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:14,820
She said that publicly before he
announced.

2391
01:38:14,821 --> 01:38:15,390
Yeah,
she's like,

2392
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:17,810
enough tooth and two is enough.
Well,

2393
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:19,140
it's a monarchy.
Yeah.

2394
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:23,830
What's also crazy to me,
why would he want to do it at that?

2395
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:26,880
Right?
Who the hell knows why does anybody want

2396
01:38:26,881 --> 01:38:28,920
to do it?
But he seemed to be like the least

2397
01:38:28,921 --> 01:38:32,490
qualified of album.
Will trump's the least qualified in the

2398
01:38:32,491 --> 01:38:33,291
bushes?
Oh yeah.

2399
01:38:33,291 --> 01:38:34,470
Yeah.
And as far as his ability to

2400
01:38:34,471 --> 01:38:36,080
communicate,
he was like the worst of it.

2401
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:37,060
No.
So Jeb,

2402
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:39,480
in 1996,
I think it was,

2403
01:38:39,481 --> 01:38:41,670
he ran for reelection against this guy.

2404
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:43,470
I forgot his name.
Baylor bend something.

2405
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:48,060
And they were tied and then they had a
debate and Jeb crushed him so bad that

2406
01:38:48,061 --> 01:38:50,970
he ended up winning by double digits.
The Guy who'd be generating in the

2407
01:38:50,971 --> 01:38:52,590
primaries.
It was bill mcbride,

2408
01:38:52,591 --> 01:38:54,390
I think is his name.
This was for Florida?

2409
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:55,740
Yeah,
when he was reelected.

2410
01:38:55,741 --> 01:38:58,100
Governor of Florida.
So he was a beast again,

2411
01:38:58,110 --> 01:39:01,140
back in the day.
And then you have these debates and he's

2412
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,060
standing there,
you know?

2413
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:05,000
I mean it was,
it was hilarious too.

2414
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:06,890
I think he just didn't want to do it.
The thing was like,

2415
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,870
I don't think fast.
I don't think any of them have ever

2416
01:39:09,871 --> 01:39:13,620
known what to do with a trump figure,
especially who's leading them.

2417
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:15,510
And when the guy's been trump's on stage
saying,

2418
01:39:15,511 --> 01:39:18,270
this guy's a real sick guy.
He said he was going to pull down his

2419
01:39:18,271 --> 01:39:20,010
pants and moon everyone.

2420
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:22,290
And Jeff's like,
what do you say to that?

2421
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:24,010
Is that what trump says?
Yes.

2422
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:29,250
And
it will be really fascinating if Alec

2423
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:31,470
Baldwin ran against trump.
You think he's gonna run?

2424
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,393
No,
I don't.

2425
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:36,270
But it would be fascinating because
there's a guy who not only did trump on

2426
01:39:36,271 --> 01:39:39,990
Syrah live,
but is more than capable of holding his

2427
01:39:39,991 --> 01:39:44,660
own and that kind of a fist to cuff sort
of a debate like if he,

2428
01:39:44,661 --> 01:39:47,100
if it insults being thrown back and
forth,

2429
01:39:47,101 --> 01:39:48,810
and that kind of.
I told us a great [inaudible] you

2430
01:39:48,811 --> 01:39:51,960
remember when Alec Baldwin lost the Shit
and the reporter and called him a fag

2431
01:39:51,961 --> 01:39:53,400
and all this other stuff.
Remember this.

2432
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,460
So Alec was that.
But it wasn't that guy a popper off to

2433
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:58,560
fine.
The point is he's taking pictures of his

2434
01:39:58,561 --> 01:40:00,090
family.
He's got emotionally worked up,

2435
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:03,510
he's got thin skin.
And that's not in those,

2436
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:04,350
in those debates.

2437
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:05,660
Trump knows how to swing.
Right?

2438
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:07,740
But Alec Baldwin's never been in debate.
The point is,

2439
01:40:07,741 --> 01:40:10,680
if Alec Baldwin loses his shit,
he's trying to present himself as the

2440
01:40:10,681 --> 01:40:13,890
same of alternative to this lunatic.
So if they're both saying they're both

2441
01:40:13,891 --> 01:40:16,350
fucking lunatics,
was baldwins advantage?

2442
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:20,610
Better looking.
I'm not nearly as power hungry,

2443
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:25,730
not a billionaire oligarch type.
Anyone thought trump was power hungry?

2444
01:40:25,981 --> 01:40:30,330
That wasn't the knock against him.
But they definitely thought it was money

2445
01:40:30,331 --> 01:40:31,560
hungry.
Well yeah,

2446
01:40:31,561 --> 01:40:34,380
but like Ted Cruz came up as much more
power hungry.

2447
01:40:34,381 --> 01:40:37,920
I think that trump did well.
The Ted Cruz was kind of sunk by those

2448
01:40:37,921 --> 01:40:42,450
weird commercial out clips.
We the outtakes where you got to see

2449
01:40:42,451 --> 01:40:43,770
them Redo it.
Oh yeah.

2450
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:47,250
I remember when he said it was my.
It was my mother play prays for me for

2451
01:40:47,251 --> 01:40:51,420
an hour everyday and she was like,
his daughter wouldn't kiss him.

2452
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:53,560
Yeah.
His daughter wouldn't kiss ever.

2453
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:54,340
There was awkward

2454
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:56,560
hugs and they had a redo takes and it's
like,

2455
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:59,230
whoa.
My favorite thing during the primaries

2456
01:40:59,231 --> 01:41:01,990
was ted Cruz's regardless,
like the best debater in Washington.

2457
01:41:01,991 --> 01:41:02,770
Right?
Izzy?

2458
01:41:02,770 --> 01:41:04,380
Yeah.
They all respect him that he was like,

2459
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:06,580
it has this long debate history from
what was it?

2460
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:10,390
Harvard or Yale or where he went to.
And this guy could practice for 100

2461
01:41:10,391 --> 01:41:13,540
years with 100 different fake opponents.
And in that time,

2462
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,430
no one would ever think of throwing at
him.

2463
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:20,640
Your Dad Shot Jfk.
What was that about?

2464
01:41:21,370 --> 01:41:24,790
How about the Zodiac killer shit.
He kept calling the Zodiac cat.

2465
01:41:25,130 --> 01:41:28,960
That's the green frog approach.
That's the green frog effect.

2466
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:30,520
Yes.
It's wonderful trolls.

2467
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:34,750
I started calling Hillary America's
mother-in-law and that caught on a bit

2468
01:41:34,751 --> 01:41:37,990
and that's how you have to take down
these people is not through their ideas,

2469
01:41:37,991 --> 01:41:41,590
but just kind of take their strengths
and turn them into weaknesses.

2470
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:44,470
That's hilarious.
I remember there was a real clear moment

2471
01:41:44,471 --> 01:41:48,190
during the campaign were Ted Cruz had
not yet stepped away,

2472
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:48,710
not,
not,

2473
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:49,870
not,
not yet resigned,

2474
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:54,430
but there was.
He was at a speech and somehow or

2475
01:41:54,431 --> 01:41:58,150
another some trump supporter was in the
front row wearing sunglasses,

2476
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:02,080
telling them to quit and calling them
lying Ted and saying,

2477
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:03,760
you've already lost.
When are you going to quit?

2478
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:08,170
And he was trying to engage.
This guy was outside and I was like,

2479
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:09,520
oh,
this guy's fucked up.

2480
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,650
He doesn't know how to deal with like a
real person.

2481
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:14,560
What about when he had fear?
Rena as his running mate and she follows

2482
01:42:14,561 --> 01:42:18,190
up the stage at their announcement.
It was like this curb your enthusiasm

2483
01:42:18,191 --> 01:42:19,330
moment.
It was amazing.

2484
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,670
How is this ever going to turn it
around?

2485
01:42:21,671 --> 01:42:24,070
Like what?
What do you anticipate happening?

2486
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:27,760
My whole 2020,
my hope is that the gears of government

2487
01:42:27,761 --> 01:42:31,660
are going to be increasingly shut down,
that political communication becomes

2488
01:42:31,661 --> 01:42:34,120
impossible and we start breaking this
stuff apart.

2489
01:42:34,150 --> 01:42:35,680
That's my goal.
But don't you?

2490
01:42:35,681 --> 01:42:39,190
Don't you think it will take like
forever to come up with some new sort of

2491
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:42,290
structure to run this?
I don't think we need to angled con.

2492
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:45,370
I don't think we need a structure.
I think a lot of the structures in place

2493
01:42:45,371 --> 01:42:49,240
that most of the interaction you have
between humans is already there with

2494
01:42:49,241 --> 01:42:50,830
structure.
We didn't have any structure here for me

2495
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:51,790
to get here,
right?

2496
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:54,220
So I don't think we're gonna need much
replacing.

2497
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:55,050
Right?
But,

2498
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:58,720
but there's no way that the people that
are in the positions of power right now,

2499
01:42:58,721 --> 01:43:00,850
whether there'll be senators,
republican congressmen,

2500
01:43:00,851 --> 01:43:01,870
Republicans,
Democrats,

2501
01:43:01,871 --> 01:43:03,130
whoever the fuck it is,
no way.

2502
01:43:03,131 --> 01:43:05,510
They're just going to accept the fact
that the structure doesn't exist in.

2503
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:07,600
Correct.
So the way to do that as technology.

2504
01:43:07,601 --> 01:43:09,610
And here's,
here's an example I always use like

2505
01:43:09,611 --> 01:43:11,320
let's suppose it's 1980,
right?

2506
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:14,140
And me and you are technologically
advanced.

2507
01:43:14,141 --> 01:43:15,540
Humans have walked on the moon,
you know,

2508
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:18,340
we have mobile phones,
so on and so forth and you and I are

2509
01:43:18,341 --> 01:43:22,120
having an argument about censorship and
you're saying we need to censor some

2510
01:43:22,121 --> 01:43:24,400
things might come for child pornography.
I'm like,

2511
01:43:24,401 --> 01:43:28,330
we have to have free speech and Jamie
appears from 2017 and he goes,

2512
01:43:28,331 --> 01:43:32,800
you guys are wasting your time because
soon you will be able to copy any book

2513
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:36,820
with one button and with one button you
can send it anywhere on earth at the

2514
01:43:36,821 --> 01:43:38,440
speed of light.
How much does it cost?

2515
01:43:38,441 --> 01:43:41,380
It's free and if you have to have a
magic words to other people can read

2516
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:43,600
this books.
A censorship is technically impossible.

2517
01:43:43,870 --> 01:43:45,520
You would.
We would both look at him like he's

2518
01:43:45,521 --> 01:43:46,690
crazy,
but that's what's happened.

2519
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:51,830
So technology is increasingly.
I'm binding the hands of government.

2520
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:55,520
When we were kids,
the idea that apple with apple didn't

2521
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:57,740
exist then maybe,
but the apple would tell the government,

2522
01:43:57,950 --> 01:44:02,570
we're making a lock on our phones that
even we can't open because we understand

2523
01:44:02,571 --> 01:44:05,150
that you are the problem.
That would have been unthinkable.

2524
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:08,630
And now we have corporations openly
defying the state because they realized

2525
01:44:08,631 --> 01:44:11,450
that they are often the enemy.
And that's wonderful.

2526
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:12,180
Uber,
look,

2527
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:14,840
his whole model is we're gonna,
we're gonna ask for forgiveness,

2528
01:44:14,841 --> 01:44:17,900
not permission.
We're going to break the law until you

2529
01:44:17,901 --> 01:44:20,510
guys say it's illegal.
We're not going to have licensing.

2530
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:24,940
It's great and we're going to become
entrenched in the city until you know,

2531
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,170
then you can't get us out.
And then someone might lift,

2532
01:44:27,171 --> 01:44:28,490
comes along and says,
well,

2533
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:29,750
they're doing it,
but they're not doing it.

2534
01:44:29,751 --> 01:44:30,290
Right,
right.

2535
01:44:30,290 --> 01:44:31,770
Exactly.
Yeah.

2536
01:44:31,910 --> 01:44:33,890
And then that's the spirit of
competition.

2537
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:35,570
Yes.
It's a beautiful thing.

2538
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:37,880
I just wonder how that applies to
government.

2539
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:39,770
Well,
because if the government's hands are

2540
01:44:39,771 --> 01:44:43,430
tied with religions,
then people are going to negotiate

2541
01:44:43,431 --> 01:44:46,820
through piece
just like we do now.

2542
01:44:46,821 --> 01:44:48,380
Like I mean if you have a problem with
macy's,

2543
01:44:48,381 --> 01:44:50,330
you either return the sweater,
you take the loss,

2544
01:44:50,331 --> 01:44:51,680
but it's,
it's fine.

2545
01:44:51,740 --> 01:44:54,680
But how does that play out though in
like a real life scenario?

2546
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:58,580
I think what's going to have to happen
is just like with books and books,

2547
01:44:58,581 --> 01:45:00,050
you know,
it can go anywhere or at the speed of

2548
01:45:00,051 --> 01:45:02,180
light.
Once you have people being able to move

2549
01:45:02,181 --> 01:45:05,360
very quickly from place to place,
they're going to start becoming

2550
01:45:05,361 --> 01:45:06,440
effectively the

2551
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:10,630
property of whatever country they happen
to be in because right now we have

2552
01:45:10,631 --> 01:45:14,160
things divided by geography,
but if you have your have landline

2553
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:17,690
technology when it comes to government
as a in a cell phone world or even a

2554
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:20,860
beyond cell phone world,
if you had it where I'm the government

2555
01:45:20,861 --> 01:45:23,920
or whatever cell phone provider I have
that would carry with me if I'm in

2556
01:45:23,921 --> 01:45:28,360
Taiwan or Russia or the United States as
opposed to when I'm in the between these

2557
01:45:28,361 --> 01:45:30,700
two oceans,
it's US law when I'm in between these

2558
01:45:30,701 --> 01:45:31,870
two oceans is British law.

2559
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:36,710
That's fascinating.
So do you think that in the future we'll

2560
01:45:36,711 --> 01:45:41,711
see like a dissolving of borders for the
ability to travel back that I think a

2561
01:45:42,081 --> 01:45:43,970
lot of people support that that's
already started happening.

2562
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:44,840
Yeah,
it's.

2563
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,070
I mean the idea.
Like right now,

2564
01:45:46,071 --> 01:45:49,100
I could go any country on earth,
including North Korea right now,

2565
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:50,570
let's listen to case a hundred years
ago,

2566
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:54,800
this trump thing that got him elected.
One of the things was build that wall,

2567
01:45:54,830 --> 01:45:56,050
build that wall,
this.

2568
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:59,300
Do you think that this is like a retro
idea or an idea of like almost like a

2569
01:45:59,301 --> 01:46:03,620
longing for nostalgia,
like a pushing back against technology,

2570
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:06,860
pushing back against progress.
Think it's the pushing forward for the

2571
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:11,150
idea of self segregation and the idea
that you should surround yourself with

2572
01:46:11,151 --> 01:46:14,120
people that you choose as opposed to
people that you are forced to surround

2573
01:46:14,121 --> 01:46:18,290
yourself with and that people are pack
animals and I shouldn't have to.

2574
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:20,810
The idea that me and my neighbors in my
building,

2575
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:23,060
I get to sit down and make a consensus
is bullshit.

2576
01:46:23,061 --> 01:46:25,130
I want to sit down with my friends and
make a consensus.

2577
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:26,390
Right?
But that's what you're talking about.

2578
01:46:26,391 --> 01:46:28,920
The whole entire United States though,
the building,

2579
01:46:28,921 --> 01:46:31,490
the wall between us and Mexico,
but the point seems to me that they're

2580
01:46:31,491 --> 01:46:33,860
just wanting to keep out the unfortunate
people.

2581
01:46:33,890 --> 01:46:35,660
Well,
they also want to keep themselves as a

2582
01:46:35,661 --> 01:46:36,830
cohesive whole,
right,

2583
01:46:36,831 --> 01:46:38,840
so they want to maintain this idea of
Americanness,

2584
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:41,420
whereas they're being told that
Americanists means everyone on earth can

2585
01:46:41,421 --> 01:46:43,580
come here.
Well,

2586
01:46:43,581 --> 01:46:45,170
they're not saying that.
They're just saying.

2587
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:47,510
I mean no one's really saying that
anybody can come here.

2588
01:46:47,511 --> 01:46:49,440
A lot of people,
I mean if you're going to what?

2589
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:52,560
I've never heard any criteria for saying
we can't let this group in.

2590
01:46:52,890 --> 01:46:55,740
There's always some reason for letting
each and every group in and there's

2591
01:46:55,741 --> 01:46:56,940
never a reason to say no.

2592
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:59,010
While the.
The rational filter would be,

2593
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:02,730
we don't want anyone in here that has an
extensive violent criminal history,

2594
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:05,100
right?
Or I mean it could be levels of

2595
01:47:05,101 --> 01:47:07,800
education,
levels of vacation,

2596
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:10,200
of education.
Rather someone who wants to come to this

2597
01:47:10,201 --> 01:47:12,630
country.
This is a country of immigrants.

2598
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:14,700
This is a country where people try to do
better,

2599
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:16,800
right?
If you're coming here from somewhere

2600
01:47:16,801 --> 01:47:19,760
else and you want to come to America,
but you would,

2601
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:22,770
you would be coming here because you
want to do better.

2602
01:47:22,771 --> 01:47:26,340
You want to elevate yourself or elevate
your family or give your children the

2603
01:47:26,341 --> 01:47:29,460
opportunity to be educated in a way that
you weren't sure.

2604
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:32,310
That's kind of what this is founded on.
That way it was founded on it,

2605
01:47:32,311 --> 01:47:33,960
so it's become.
It's certainly wasn't founded on the

2606
01:47:33,961 --> 01:47:36,480
idea for a country of immigrants.
The founding fathers weren't like,

2607
01:47:36,481 --> 01:47:37,110
yeah,
yeah,

2608
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:37,620
immigrants.

2609
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:39,360
My hero,
Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant.

2610
01:47:39,361 --> 01:47:41,310
I'm an immigrant,
but certainly.

2611
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:46,260
I mean there's plenty of reasons to have
criteria for why people are let it just

2612
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:47,840
kind of.
But how do you define immigrants?

2613
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:51,210
Just because like if I'm in a war torn
country,

2614
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:53,100
hell yeah,
I want to go to America because it's

2615
01:47:53,101 --> 01:47:54,840
going to be better for me and my family
a hundred percent.

2616
01:47:54,841 --> 01:47:57,060
That's understandable.
That doesn't mean that I'm bringing

2617
01:47:57,061 --> 01:47:59,820
something to the table to America.
Not always.

2618
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:00,600
Right.
Well,

2619
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,810
I mean you can't say that even about
someone who comes from a thriving.

2620
01:48:03,820 --> 01:48:07,020
Correct me
to come over from England,

2621
01:48:07,021 --> 01:48:09,840
as I said earlier and they're ugly,
ugly,

2622
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:14,250
looser,
so maybe we should have a contest of six

2623
01:48:14,251 --> 01:48:16,030
or above us.
How do you feel?

2624
01:48:16,050 --> 01:48:17,170
Do you feel you're a six?
Uh,

2625
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:20,310
I,
I think I'm above a sex the way you are,

2626
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:23,100
but if you were in Holland,
the men are all giant,

2627
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:23,730
handsome.

2628
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:25,920
I think he might not be as sick as well.
Good thing I'm not in Holland.

2629
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:28,910
Don't let any of those people over here.
Yeah,

2630
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:31,590
we got to Sweden.
Mr. President,

2631
01:48:31,591 --> 01:48:34,860
please.
New comment if I would make them bigger

2632
01:48:34,861 --> 01:48:36,990
though.
Not going to be 20 feet tall,

2633
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:37,711
but the.
Yeah,

2634
01:48:37,711 --> 01:48:40,110
right.
They'll grow Godzilla lions.

2635
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:42,540
Exactly.
Under pressure.

2636
01:48:42,541 --> 01:48:43,580
Right.
But I mean,

2637
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:45,580
but going back to the immigrant thing,
I mean,

2638
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:49,590
this country,
essentially everyone who is here who's

2639
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:52,890
not native American at one point in time
was an immigrant.

2640
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:54,960
Sure.
But I mean there's different types of

2641
01:48:54,961 --> 01:48:57,020
differences.
The immigrants who try to assimilate and

2642
01:48:57,021 --> 01:48:59,220
there's the immigrants who don't
assimilate and just because we've done

2643
01:48:59,221 --> 01:49:01,020
some assimilate,
I don't see anybody walking around with

2644
01:49:01,021 --> 01:49:04,380
Buckskin on wearing feathers.
I mean there's no one assimilate it from

2645
01:49:04,381 --> 01:49:06,090
Europe.
What do you mean I've assimilated?

2646
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:06,901
Well,
sort of,

2647
01:49:06,901 --> 01:49:08,790
but I mean the original people that came
here,

2648
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:10,110
people that came here.

2649
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:12,180
If you're going to assimilate,
you're going to assimilate with the

2650
01:49:12,181 --> 01:49:14,250
native Americans.
No one did that.

2651
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:15,360
Sure.
They conquered them.

2652
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:17,760
He can say that.
Yeah.

2653
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:19,710
I mean it was more like genocide than
conquering,

2654
01:49:19,711 --> 01:49:22,170
but Jenna isn't genocide just when you
conquer really well?

2655
01:49:22,230 --> 01:49:23,063
Well,
yeah,

2656
01:49:23,070 --> 01:49:25,380
in a lot of it is unfortunately because
of disease.

2657
01:49:25,410 --> 01:49:26,280
Well,
it's also the fact.

2658
01:49:26,281 --> 01:49:30,000
I mean the idea that it genocide.
I mean these native Americans were tough

2659
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:32,970
cookies.
These were not these like nature hippies

2660
01:49:32,971 --> 01:49:34,950
that they're made out to be.
I mean there's the reason that baseball

2661
01:49:34,951 --> 01:49:37,640
teams are native to native Americans
because they were mean.

2662
01:49:37,650 --> 01:49:38,740
They chopped up.
Uh,

2663
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:40,290
uh,
what's her name?

2664
01:49:40,291 --> 01:49:41,700
The one who founded Rhode Island.
I mean,

2665
01:49:41,701 --> 01:49:43,440
we know the rock.
She was hiding behind which before,

2666
01:49:43,441 --> 01:49:47,530
and she got Scout Scout,
so they were tough warlike populations,

2667
01:49:47,531 --> 01:49:48,580
many of them.
So.

2668
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:53,260
But the idea that just because we're
this many immigrant populations means we

2669
01:49:53,261 --> 01:49:54,520
have to continue being that way.

2670
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:56,530
That's not a really a good argument.
Well,

2671
01:49:56,531 --> 01:49:58,750
it's not really an argument.
I'm just saying that we're essentially

2672
01:49:58,751 --> 01:50:02,180
founded by immigrants.
Not Saying we have to keep doing this is

2673
01:50:02,190 --> 01:50:05,170
what what we became,
but we were counted here from somewhere

2674
01:50:05,171 --> 01:50:06,520
else.
Everyone came here from somewhere else,

2675
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:09,490
but we were founded by immigrants from
very specific places.

2676
01:50:10,030 --> 01:50:12,220
Now whether that's good or bad is a
separate issue,

2677
01:50:12,221 --> 01:50:13,320
but the idea that,
you know,

2678
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:15,850
the founding fathers,
some of them were from Syria and some of

2679
01:50:15,851 --> 01:50:18,610
them were from then as well as not true.
Right.

2680
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:21,070
They're mostly from Europe,
mostly specifically from British

2681
01:50:21,071 --> 01:50:23,260
speaking Europe.
Yeah,

2682
01:50:23,410 --> 01:50:24,340
that's true.
I mean,

2683
01:50:24,341 --> 01:50:26,470
but there were still plenty of
immigrants from Germany,

2684
01:50:26,471 --> 01:50:29,170
plenty of immigrants from Czechoslovakia
and Poland.

2685
01:50:29,230 --> 01:50:34,030
Poland was a huge immigrant population
early in the birth of the United States.

2686
01:50:34,130 --> 01:50:36,910
Right.
And they were thinking of making German

2687
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,820
the official language because they hated
the British so much at one point.

2688
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:41,940
And there's still a huge German speaking
populations,

2689
01:50:41,941 --> 01:50:45,670
but I think this argument is much more
complicated than people make it out to

2690
01:50:45,671 --> 01:50:47,620
be.
And the idea that like,

2691
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:49,060
you know,
we're going to have complete open

2692
01:50:49,061 --> 01:50:52,030
borders without consequences is crazy.
And listen to my.

2693
01:50:52,090 --> 01:50:56,380
My mom still lives in a Russian
neighborhood in Brooklyn and it's a very

2694
01:50:56,381 --> 01:50:59,080
different place from the rest of New
York and I think that's a good thing,

2695
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:01,150
but the idea that it's not a thing at
all.

2696
01:51:01,151 --> 01:51:02,020
It's false.
We're.

2697
01:51:02,030 --> 01:51:03,360
Yeah.
Well you can't say it's not a thing at

2698
01:51:03,361 --> 01:51:05,860
all.
So is the question whether or not the

2699
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:09,100
consequences of open borders or worth
the.

2700
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:14,120
The eventual gain some sort of
egalitarian society where everyone has

2701
01:51:15,101 --> 01:51:16,420
the opportunity to advance?
Well,

2702
01:51:16,421 --> 01:51:18,940
I think a lot of times when people are
on the left,

2703
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:22,060
they don't think of costs.
They think if this is a good thing,

2704
01:51:22,061 --> 01:51:24,550
we don't have to worry about the cost
and it's the right thing to do.

2705
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:26,410
And then when you bring up the cost,
like they're,

2706
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:27,850
they're saying,
well you're a terrible person.

2707
01:51:27,851 --> 01:51:30,070
It's like sometimes the cost is worth
it,

2708
01:51:30,071 --> 01:51:31,900
but you have to acknowledge that there
is a cost.

2709
01:51:31,901 --> 01:51:34,860
Like we're seeing this right now with
transgender athletes when people are

2710
01:51:34,861 --> 01:51:36,130
like,
well what happens when someone who's

2711
01:51:36,131 --> 01:51:38,890
grown up mail is fighting someone who's
a female?

2712
01:51:38,891 --> 01:51:40,180
Like this is something we have to
grapple with.

2713
01:51:40,181 --> 01:51:40,751
It's like,
oh,

2714
01:51:40,751 --> 01:51:43,150
you're making up imaginary scenarios
like this is happening now,

2715
01:51:43,151 --> 01:51:45,100
like let's,
maybe it's the right thing to do,

2716
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:49,150
but you still have to consider what are
the costs and radical inclusive

2717
01:51:49,151 --> 01:51:50,830
progressivism is,
they're just,

2718
01:51:51,090 --> 01:51:53,890
there are no differences.
There's no difference between gender.

2719
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:56,740
There's no biological difference in
gender.

2720
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:00,760
So there are so fundamentalist,
believe in creationism that God created

2721
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:03,970
the world in seven days.
They have their own creation is in which

2722
01:52:03,971 --> 01:52:05,600
is that everyone was created equal and
remain.

2723
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:07,150
So yeah.
Well,

2724
01:52:07,151 --> 01:52:09,730
it doesn't work when it comes to combat
sports for sure.

2725
01:52:09,790 --> 01:52:11,200
And that's like,
that is the,

2726
01:52:11,410 --> 01:52:13,000
that's where the rubber meets the road,
right.

2727
01:52:13,330 --> 01:52:15,340
Heel doesn't work in any aspect.
I mean,

2728
01:52:15,341 --> 01:52:16,250
if I grew up in,
uh,

2729
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:17,093
in my,
my,

2730
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,880
my dad's,
my parents are lawyers,

2731
01:52:18,881 --> 01:52:21,520
not that they are in real life.
I'm going to certainly have that

2732
01:52:21,521 --> 01:52:23,350
background and that advantage that other
people don't have.

2733
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:25,480
Now that might be a good thing or it
might be a bad thing,

2734
01:52:25,481 --> 01:52:26,710
but it's a thing.
Yes,

2735
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,540
it is a thing,
especially if you want to continue in

2736
01:52:28,541 --> 01:52:29,374
that business,
right?

2737
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:30,401
Yeah.
While there's.

2738
01:52:30,401 --> 01:52:32,080
Yeah,
I mean the idea that we're all,

2739
01:52:32,110 --> 01:52:35,170
that we come from a,
an even position that we're all the

2740
01:52:35,171 --> 01:52:37,090
same.
Starting Line is pretty preposterous.

2741
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,210
Correct.
Yeah.

2742
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,730
The idea is just,
I mean,

2743
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:40,780
if you want to,
like,

2744
01:52:40,781 --> 01:52:42,400
you can't fix that,
you can't change that.

2745
01:52:42,401 --> 01:52:44,110
That is what it is and you shouldn't
want to change it.

2746
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:46,130
We should try to do is make the best

2747
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:48,050
out of whatever hand you've been given.
Right?

2748
01:52:48,530 --> 01:52:49,370
Right.
I think that,

2749
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:53,090
I think if you want to look at this
country and the real issues that we face

2750
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:54,440
there,
you know,

2751
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:59,120
they're multifaceted,
but one of the biggest ones is that

2752
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:03,080
there are some areas of our country that
continue to,

2753
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:06,110
um,
have people that are impoverished and in

2754
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:08,840
crime ridden areas and these areas don't
ever change.

2755
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:10,670
Right.
And that's one of our biggest problems.

2756
01:53:10,671 --> 01:53:12,590
I mean,
we're so concerned with all these

2757
01:53:12,591 --> 01:53:17,300
different issues and all sorts of valid
issues that are happening all over the

2758
01:53:17,301 --> 01:53:20,510
world,
but the issues of our own impoverished

2759
01:53:20,511 --> 01:53:23,390
communities that continue to be
impoverished south side of Chicago,

2760
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:25,750
you know,
horrible areas of Texas are.

2761
01:53:25,751 --> 01:53:29,360
So there's some areas that just don't
get any better and they stay that way

2762
01:53:29,361 --> 01:53:32,450
generation after generation after
generation and they don't.

2763
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:38,020
There's not enough interest in them in
terms of like broad mainstream focus

2764
01:53:38,690 --> 01:53:39,400
where they say,
look,

2765
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:43,430
well we have to dedicate and allocate a
massive amount of resources to fixing

2766
01:53:43,431 --> 01:53:44,210
these inner cities.

2767
01:53:44,210 --> 01:53:46,760
And maybe just one project,
one flint,

2768
01:53:46,761 --> 01:53:49,460
Michigan style project where they say,
listen,

2769
01:53:49,461 --> 01:53:52,700
let's just dump and an x amount of time,
resources,

2770
01:53:52,701 --> 01:53:56,870
money and engineering,
figure out some way to fix these areas,

2771
01:53:56,871 --> 01:53:59,630
provide jobs,
make things more safe,

2772
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:01,880
you know,
established community centers.

2773
01:54:01,881 --> 01:54:06,350
Do something and let's see if we can do
that and have it one case study one

2774
01:54:06,351 --> 01:54:08,030
impoverished city,
see if he could bring it up.

2775
01:54:08,090 --> 01:54:10,850
And then once you do,
move forward and try this in other

2776
01:54:10,851 --> 01:54:14,870
places I've always had like the best way
to make America stronger is to have less

2777
01:54:14,871 --> 01:54:17,150
losers.
Like what's the best way to have less

2778
01:54:17,151 --> 01:54:17,751
losers?
Well,

2779
01:54:17,751 --> 01:54:20,150
one one,
one way is to give people more of a

2780
01:54:20,151 --> 01:54:21,380
chance.
Give people.

2781
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:25,010
Like if you grew up in suburban Los
Angeles and you live in some nice

2782
01:54:25,011 --> 01:54:27,860
neighborhood and you know,
studio city or something like that,

2783
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:31,880
it's fairly safe and you have a much
higher likelihood of success than

2784
01:54:31,881 --> 01:54:36,800
someone who grows up in a crime ridden
drug filled environment where people are

2785
01:54:36,801 --> 01:54:41,270
constantly going to jail and those,
those sort of recurring cycles of

2786
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:44,240
poverty and crime,
they happened generation after

2787
01:54:44,241 --> 01:54:47,480
generation after generation and some in
some cases,

2788
01:54:47,481 --> 01:54:50,540
like in Baltimore,
there's clear evidence of systematic

2789
01:54:50,541 --> 01:54:51,650
racism,
you know,

2790
01:54:51,651 --> 01:54:55,130
that literally people were stopped from
buying houses in certain areas.

2791
01:54:55,310 --> 01:54:58,370
Stop from moving into areas.
But in other areas it's like,

2792
01:54:58,550 --> 01:55:01,940
it's just almost like it does it itself
because he's right,

2793
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:03,311
right.
And,

2794
01:55:03,311 --> 01:55:04,071
and they,
they,

2795
01:55:04,071 --> 01:55:06,770
I always have this litmus test for
people to find out if they're left wing

2796
01:55:06,771 --> 01:55:09,080
or right wing.
So people like to pretend I'm neither,

2797
01:55:09,081 --> 01:55:11,870
I'm both.
You ask them are some people better than

2798
01:55:11,871 --> 01:55:13,370
others?
And if you're right wing you're going to

2799
01:55:13,371 --> 01:55:15,140
say yes.
And if you're left wing,

2800
01:55:15,141 --> 01:55:17,870
you're going to start babbling a whole
speech better in like,

2801
01:55:17,871 --> 01:55:19,850
what does better mean?
Whatever you think.

2802
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:23,430
In any sense of the word,
but it's sucking dicks as some people

2803
01:55:23,590 --> 01:55:25,370
who are better and some people are clear
that's right here,

2804
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:27,890
but what causes that?
Some people are like,

2805
01:55:27,891 --> 01:55:29,120
no,
they just need to learn how to suck

2806
01:55:29,121 --> 01:55:29,954
dicks better.
Right?

2807
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:31,390
Right.
And not everyone that I get,

2808
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:33,360
I don't.
This is not a road on,

2809
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:36,270
I know enough about to go down,
but dare you.

2810
01:55:36,590 --> 01:55:37,910
Okay.
Let's say play the flute,

2811
01:55:37,990 --> 01:55:38,220
right?

2812
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:41,510
So the skin flute or regular flu.
Some people are better at it,

2813
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:43,620
right?
Some people are better at math,

2814
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:45,930
some people and that's going to be a
function of the mind,

2815
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:47,530
you know,
and that's something that not everyone's

2816
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:51,000
going to be able to equally good at.
And you have to start with that point

2817
01:55:51,001 --> 01:55:53,700
that we are born with different gifts,
um,

2818
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,850
or we have different interests and we
pursue those specialty focus and

2819
01:55:56,851 --> 01:55:58,410
determination.
Yeah,

2820
01:55:58,411 --> 01:56:00,420
I mean there's certain things like
guitarists,

2821
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:02,040
like there's,
there's no doubt about it.

2822
01:56:02,041 --> 01:56:04,230
This isn't like Stevie Ray Vaughan,
Jimi Hendrix,

2823
01:56:04,231 --> 01:56:07,950
Gary Clark Jr is people that have like
an exceptional ability to play

2824
01:56:07,951 --> 01:56:10,540
incredible music out of a guitar.
Does that,

2825
01:56:10,590 --> 01:56:11,790
what does that,
is that mean?

2826
01:56:11,850 --> 01:56:12,810
Where's that coming from?
Well,

2827
01:56:12,811 --> 01:56:14,370
it's also,
you and I are both self taught.

2828
01:56:14,371 --> 01:56:16,230
I'm sure you never get a major in
podcasting.

2829
01:56:16,231 --> 01:56:17,730
I never took an English course,
you know,

2830
01:56:17,731 --> 01:56:19,500
and,
and you've had many different careers

2831
01:56:19,501 --> 01:56:20,040
over your life.

2832
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,590
So vi and that's just a function of the
self.

2833
01:56:22,591 --> 01:56:23,940
It's not a function of,
of uh,

2834
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:25,030
the culture,
the,

2835
01:56:25,070 --> 01:56:26,610
it is,
it's also luck.

2836
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:28,800
It's also being in the right place at
the right time.

2837
01:56:28,801 --> 01:56:33,801
It's also finding a job that exists that
fills my very unique personality and

2838
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,960
making that job exist.
No one,

2839
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:38,640
you know,
no one made me write this book.

2840
01:56:38,641 --> 01:56:41,760
I did a kickstarter,
I raised the 30 grand and I'm like,

2841
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:44,430
now I'm going to do it myself.
So the publishing industry didn't know

2842
01:56:44,431 --> 01:56:46,320
what to make of it.
And how's it been?

2843
01:56:46,350 --> 01:56:47,520
How's it?
It's,

2844
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:48,420
I mean,
just,

2845
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:50,140
I got it.
I was the first one to have a,

2846
01:56:50,141 --> 01:56:53,220
a cspan book TV for a kickstarter book a
whole hour.

2847
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:55,050
I mean,
I'm on all these different shows talking

2848
01:56:55,051 --> 01:56:58,480
about it because they didn't know it and
it's been a great success with as that

2849
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:01,410
in that way it's got parallels I think
to podcasting.

2850
01:57:01,410 --> 01:57:04,440
Yes,
in that once you find something that

2851
01:57:04,441 --> 01:57:07,740
you're really passionate about this and
people realize that you're really

2852
01:57:07,741 --> 01:57:10,170
passionate about and you put so much
effort and focus into it,

2853
01:57:10,171 --> 01:57:11,790
they can see that in your work.
Yes,

2854
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:14,430
and they appreciate that and I think
people are very much,

2855
01:57:14,431 --> 01:57:16,770
and this is another reason I load
cynicism.

2856
01:57:17,070 --> 01:57:20,460
People are drawn to earnestness,
they are drawn into passion and they are

2857
01:57:20,461 --> 01:57:22,720
drawn to sincerity and honesty and like
La,

2858
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:26,190
La and we're hungry for it and we're
desperate for it and especially I think

2859
01:57:26,191 --> 01:57:29,580
increasingly young males because there's
so much eye rolling and there's so much

2860
01:57:29,581 --> 01:57:31,500
snark and all this other stuff which I
like,

2861
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:33,600
but they like,
I want to be a better guy.

2862
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:37,590
I want to be a smarter person.
One of the big lies I was told growing

2863
01:57:37,591 --> 01:57:40,230
up is that the jocks and the nerds hate
each other,

2864
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:43,050
and when that was working with Matt
Hughes on his book and hanging out with

2865
01:57:43,051 --> 01:57:45,780
his fighter buddies,
it was a total mutual admiration

2866
01:57:45,781 --> 01:57:46,500
society.

2867
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:50,010
There was no eyebrow raised,
there was no shit talking.

2868
01:57:50,011 --> 01:57:50,910
It was complete like,
wow,

2869
01:57:50,911 --> 01:57:52,360
you're a smart dude,
you know,

2870
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:53,490
let me learn from you.
And I'm like,

2871
01:57:53,491 --> 01:57:54,570
wow,
you guys are athletes.

2872
01:57:54,571 --> 01:57:56,670
Let me learn from you.
And it's totally mutual respect.

2873
01:57:56,671 --> 01:57:58,020
It totally blew my mind.
Well,

2874
01:57:58,021 --> 01:58:02,130
one of the things about martial artists
is that there's everybody kind of.

2875
01:58:02,190 --> 01:58:05,310
I mean some people start off with a
certain physical talents and physical

2876
01:58:05,311 --> 01:58:08,280
gifts,
but when it comes to like technique and

2877
01:58:08,281 --> 01:58:10,390
ability,
you have to learn this,

2878
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:12,660
you know,
and it's something that's very humbling

2879
01:58:12,661 --> 01:58:15,120
along the way.
And so they have this understanding that

2880
01:58:15,121 --> 01:58:19,470
hard work and focus and technique and
knowledge.

2881
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:21,900
Yes.
All applied together equals results.

2882
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:24,300
Yeah.
And they're awesome people and obviously

2883
01:58:24,301 --> 01:58:25,890
this is your world,
but I mean I've been.

2884
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:29,310
I was blown away by these guys and had
such respect for them and I didn't think

2885
01:58:29,311 --> 01:58:30,690
I would.
I think it's changing.

2886
01:58:30,691 --> 01:58:33,360
I think perception of who fighters are
is changing and I think that's one of

2887
01:58:33,361 --> 01:58:38,361
the reasons why there's such a big blow
back when someone is like a thuggish

2888
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:42,160
bully asshole ish sort of and that

2889
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:46,360
these people aren't respected nearly as
much as someone like a George St Pierre

2890
01:58:46,361 --> 01:58:47,440
who is a gentleman,
right?

2891
01:58:47,650 --> 01:58:51,060
Conor mcgregor who was just this wild,
brilliant trash talker.

2892
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:52,750
Right?
And these people like you,

2893
01:58:52,751 --> 01:58:53,180
you,
you,

2894
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:57,670
you could recognize that there some
significant mind games going on.

2895
01:58:57,950 --> 01:59:01,900
There's some real thinking and they're
not macho in the sense of they're not

2896
01:59:01,901 --> 01:59:04,060
posturing.
Like they don't need to stand up and be

2897
01:59:04,061 --> 01:59:05,260
like,
I can kick your ass like all the

2898
01:59:05,261 --> 01:59:07,210
fighters.
I knew if people go up to the bar and be

2899
01:59:07,211 --> 01:59:07,601
like,
you know,

2900
01:59:07,601 --> 01:59:08,860
I bet you I could kick your ass.
They'd be like,

2901
01:59:08,861 --> 01:59:10,060
I'm sure you can.
You know what I mean?

2902
01:59:10,130 --> 01:59:13,300
It still happens to these guys.
They have to walk away from fights all

2903
01:59:13,301 --> 01:59:15,190
the time,
but they do it gladly because they don't

2904
01:59:15,191 --> 01:59:16,100
have a chip.
Some of them do.

2905
01:59:16,101 --> 01:59:17,980
I'm sure you have a chip on the shoulder
of most of the ones I met.

2906
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:19,480
None of them did and they would just be
like,

2907
01:59:19,481 --> 01:59:20,314
okay,
that's fine.

2908
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:23,980
I saw it in person one night at a
nightclub in Vegas with some guy was

2909
01:59:23,981 --> 01:59:27,070
talking shit to chocolate Dell.
It was so ridiculous.

2910
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:29,470
I mean I was just like,
what is this guy doing?

2911
01:59:29,590 --> 01:59:32,650
And then chocolate Dell just kind of
looked at him dead eyed and you know,

2912
01:59:32,651 --> 01:59:35,680
it said something to them and you see
the guy like saw his life passed before

2913
01:59:35,681 --> 01:59:39,100
his eyes and eventually realized came to
his senses and people pulled them away.

2914
01:59:39,101 --> 01:59:41,140
But I was like,
what is this fucking guy doing?

2915
01:59:41,230 --> 01:59:44,320
And it's so funny that one of the
scariest moments of my life when I was

2916
01:59:44,321 --> 01:59:47,770
working with he was on his book.
He's such a happy go lucky guy.

2917
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:50,380
And then once I got an argument his face
changed and I'm like,

2918
01:59:50,381 --> 01:59:52,540
oh yeah,
that's who you are.

2919
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:55,930
It,
I completely forgot that he killed her.

2920
01:59:56,980 --> 01:59:58,990
He's one of the greatest welterweight
champion.

2921
01:59:59,810 --> 02:00:01,120
It was like,
Oh yeah,

2922
02:00:01,121 --> 02:00:02,560
Shit.
Then I felt stupid to.

2923
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:07,680
Well Matt was with first guy that
incorporated great wrestling with real

2924
02:00:08,141 --> 02:00:11,950
high level submissions.
When you see submitted Matt Frank Trigg,

2925
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:14,980
when he submitted George St Pierre,
like he submitted George Saint Pierre

2926
02:00:14,981 --> 02:00:18,160
with very advanced move.
He hit him with a farsighted armbar.

2927
02:00:18,190 --> 02:00:21,490
George committed to a memorial but
didn't have control of Matt's body and

2928
02:00:21,491 --> 02:00:23,880
Matt hit the far side arm bar and spun
around on him.

2929
02:00:23,881 --> 02:00:27,010
I remember watching that was for.
It was at 4:59 of the first round.

2930
02:00:27,011 --> 02:00:29,350
I believe he had one second to go and
George tapping really quick.

2931
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:33,010
I don't remember what time it was,
but I remember that just a brilliant

2932
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:34,440
move.
He said he,

2933
02:00:34,450 --> 02:00:36,580
when he was starting out was he was
like,

2934
02:00:36,581 --> 02:00:38,260
I know I'm strong and I'm a good
wrestler.

2935
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:40,540
I got to learn technique or else it's
going to be used against me.

2936
02:00:40,541 --> 02:00:42,640
So it was very,
very strategic with his approach.

2937
02:00:42,730 --> 02:00:45,430
He really wasn't a big factor in that
whole camp.

2938
02:00:45,431 --> 02:00:50,320
That miletich fighting system camp was
Jeremy Horn who was like really like

2939
02:00:50,321 --> 02:00:53,860
kind of a nerdy guy and a lot of.
He's not a bully type guy at all,

2940
02:00:54,070 --> 02:00:56,800
not a very strong guy,
not a freak athlete,

2941
02:00:56,801 --> 02:01:01,801
but had more than a hundred and 50
professional fights and one a shit ton

2942
02:01:01,961 --> 02:01:04,340
of them and was really.
It was the first guy to beat chocolate.

2943
02:01:04,341 --> 02:01:07,510
They'll put them to sleep from the
bottom with an arm triangle from the

2944
02:01:07,511 --> 02:01:12,160
bottom because he was just a brilliant
tactician and just very good at staying

2945
02:01:12,161 --> 02:01:15,370
calm.
Very good at figuring out like it was

2946
02:01:15,371 --> 02:01:18,310
all technique.
Jeremy was all technique and still is.

2947
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:19,210
Yeah.
I never met you.

2948
02:01:19,210 --> 02:01:21,590
I met,
always spoke extremely highly of.

2949
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:24,400
He's a great guy and all those people
and he's a super polite,

2950
02:01:24,430 --> 02:01:27,670
really kindhearted guy who just happens
to be a trained killer.

2951
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:29,680
Right.
A lot of these guys that's not super

2952
02:01:29,681 --> 02:01:30,700
polite,
but he is.

2953
02:01:30,780 --> 02:01:32,390
He's very polite.
You don't think he's super blessed.

2954
02:01:32,391 --> 02:01:34,930
So the thing with that,
I mean I can't say enough good things

2955
02:01:34,931 --> 02:01:36,700
about him,
like having been friends with him and

2956
02:01:36,701 --> 02:01:38,800
his family.
To this day I still go out to

2957
02:01:38,801 --> 02:01:41,630
hillsborough to visit them,
has changed my life so profoundly,

2958
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:44,240
but he would.
Matt Hughes meets you.

2959
02:01:44,241 --> 02:01:47,410
He'll be making fun of you and people
have them on a pedestal so they won't

2960
02:01:47,411 --> 02:01:49,250
respond back and he looks like an
asshole.

2961
02:01:49,370 --> 02:01:51,620
So when I first got the project,
this is a great story.

2962
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:53,960
I was on the phone with his manager and
his manager goes,

2963
02:01:53,961 --> 02:01:56,870
Matt's got a twin brother and when they
start messing with you,

2964
02:01:57,200 --> 02:01:59,120
you just got to stand there and take it
until they're tired.

2965
02:01:59,121 --> 02:02:00,140
And I thought to myself,
Nigga,

2966
02:02:00,141 --> 02:02:01,280
I'm from Brooklyn,
we don't play that shit.

2967
02:02:01,281 --> 02:02:03,830
I swear to God as much as I thought it,
I thought it.

2968
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:06,850
And then I think racist words to
yourself during.

2969
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:07,873
I'm thinking one now.

2970
02:02:10,730 --> 02:02:15,730
So I meet Matt and he starts with me and
I hit him back hard and he loved it.

2971
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:20,750
He loves being the butt of a joke
because he wants to be a regular guy.

2972
02:02:20,751 --> 02:02:23,090
He hates being on a pedestal.
He hates being.

2973
02:02:23,091 --> 02:02:27,110
I'm the world champion.
He's those normal dude and I think it

2974
02:02:27,111 --> 02:02:29,480
kind of bothers him that people won't
make fun of him back.

2975
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:31,490
Well,
that's sort of fight gym culture though.

2976
02:02:31,491 --> 02:02:32,880
Everybody makes fun of it.
It's the.

2977
02:02:33,130 --> 02:02:35,930
But they're scared to make fun of him
because it's all my God Matt Hughes and

2978
02:02:35,931 --> 02:02:36,380
it's like,
no,

2979
02:02:36,380 --> 02:02:36,691
no,
no,

2980
02:02:36,691 --> 02:02:37,670
no.
Please hit me.

2981
02:02:37,710 --> 02:02:39,990
Like he's always cackling and laugh,
you know,

2982
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:42,110
as the best instagram page.
Who?

2983
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:43,650
Derrick Lewis,
Derek,

2984
02:02:43,670 --> 02:02:46,340
the beast,
Lewis he's got were just knocked out.

2985
02:02:46,341 --> 02:02:48,590
Travis Brown is one of the top
heavyweights contenders.

2986
02:02:48,770 --> 02:02:51,850
His fucking instagram is whole Arius.
What?

2987
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:56,600
Hilarie he just finds the most fucked up
shit online and puts it on his instagram

2988
02:02:56,601 --> 02:02:57,380
page.

2989
02:02:57,380 --> 02:03:02,380
Like one of them was a picture of a girl
with like 15 hot dogs and her mouth and

2990
02:03:02,931 --> 02:03:05,000
it said something like,
don't worry about it.

2991
02:03:05,001 --> 02:03:06,860
These guys are all just like brothers to
me.

2992
02:03:06,861 --> 02:03:11,300
We're just going to hang out.
What do you remember?

2993
02:03:11,301 --> 02:03:13,200
Forrest Griffin for Halloween with
supergirl,

2994
02:03:14,710 --> 02:03:16,760
supergirl with the crop top and he
captioned it.

2995
02:03:16,761 --> 02:03:18,170
Does this make me look gay?
And he's like,

2996
02:03:18,171 --> 02:03:19,004
how about.
No,

2997
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:20,940
it was hilarious.
Well,

2998
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:24,150
that's problematic.
Left.

2999
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:26,030
Yeah,
I mean these guys,

3000
02:03:26,210 --> 02:03:28,820
look,
there's a lot of gallows humor and a lot

3001
02:03:28,821 --> 02:03:33,500
of like really funny guys that are
involved in like these fight gems.

3002
02:03:33,620 --> 02:03:35,480
Oh yeah.
It's because they're dealing with such

3003
02:03:35,481 --> 02:03:38,510
incredible stress levels that they need
some sort of a blow off valve.

3004
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:39,530
Right.
You know,

3005
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:43,700
Derrick Lewis is one of the top
heavyweight cage fighting fighters on

3006
02:03:43,701 --> 02:03:44,720
the planet earth.
I mean,

3007
02:03:44,721 --> 02:03:47,120
he's one of the best in the UFC right
now.

3008
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:48,950
He's just knocked out.
Travis Browne,

3009
02:03:48,951 --> 02:03:52,340
knocked him out cold and recovered from
a rough first round,

3010
02:03:52,341 --> 02:03:54,170
got hurt,
came back and knocked him out.

3011
02:03:54,171 --> 02:03:59,120
So his instagram just like,
you would think that he'd be like this

3012
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:03,170
crazy psychopaths running hills and
screaming into the night,

3013
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:04,970
you know,
like I remember when I was a kid,

3014
02:04:05,230 --> 02:04:09,040
um,
there was a video of Mostafa Ham show

3015
02:04:09,290 --> 02:04:12,050
versus Marvin Hagler.
They will do it showing this promo clip

3016
02:04:12,290 --> 02:04:15,740
and they were,
I lived in Boston and Hagler was a

3017
02:04:15,741 --> 02:04:19,940
Boston guy was from brockton and he used
to train in the Cape because it was

3018
02:04:19,941 --> 02:04:23,390
freezing cold in the winter and they'd
have him running these sand dudes in the

3019
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:24,690
renter.
And while he's running them,

3020
02:04:25,010 --> 02:04:29,960
he was screaming war and Hagler was
terrifying because he was just ripped

3021
02:04:29,961 --> 02:04:34,130
and muscular and he had a bald head and
he just was a destroyer.

3022
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:37,740
And so that was my idea of like what a
fighter is like a daily,

3023
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:39,120
like this solemn.

3024
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:40,630
Right,
you know,

3025
02:04:40,790 --> 02:04:44,370
character clowns in the best possible
way.

3026
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:45,510
Yeah.
A lot of them are very,

3027
02:04:45,511 --> 02:04:48,290
very funny and it just and appreciate,
even if they're not funded,

3028
02:04:48,291 --> 02:04:52,180
the appreciate a good sense of humor.
A lot of joking around for breezy over

3029
02:04:52,181 --> 02:04:54,090
doom jokes around a lot.
He's pretty funny.

3030
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:56,070
Yeah.
There's a lot of them that are like

3031
02:04:56,071 --> 02:04:57,540
that.
It's interesting.

3032
02:04:58,110 --> 02:05:01,470
You know.
And then when people are too serious and

3033
02:05:01,471 --> 02:05:04,530
they lose,
that's when the public goes after them.

3034
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:06,090
Right?
Like Ronda Rousey.

3035
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:07,010
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3036
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:09,300
Like I can beat anyone on earth,
man.

3037
02:05:09,301 --> 02:05:13,140
When the public one after her boy woo
dark.

3038
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:15,480
And Matt always said,
if you're not losing,

3039
02:05:15,481 --> 02:05:17,550
you're not fighting the right people.
Well,

3040
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:18,563
it's true.
Yeah.

3041
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:20,910
I mean,
unless you're some fucking freak of

3042
02:05:20,911 --> 02:05:23,790
athleticism and some top of the food
chain,

3043
02:05:23,791 --> 02:05:27,120
Roy Jones Jr type character.
And there's always gonna be those guys

3044
02:05:27,140 --> 02:05:28,770
just go,
there's always outliers,

3045
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:29,100
right?

3046
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:33,630
Who essentially their bar movers,
like they change expectations.

3047
02:05:33,631 --> 02:05:37,110
Like there was expectations for
performances inside the UFC.

3048
02:05:37,111 --> 02:05:40,020
And then there was Anderson Silva and
then Anderson Silva came along and

3049
02:05:40,021 --> 02:05:40,651
everybody went,
okay,

3050
02:05:40,651 --> 02:05:43,290
well we now we know that's possible.
But were you,

3051
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:46,350
were you calling the fight when he broke
his shin?

3052
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:49,250
Yes.
What was that like in real life to see?

3053
02:05:49,300 --> 02:05:52,920
So second time I've seen that first time
I saw it was Corey Hill broke his shin.

3054
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:54,780
And um,
I,

3055
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:59,220
I had to scream at the referee that time
because the referee didn't realize it

3056
02:05:59,221 --> 02:06:00,870
had happened.
Oh my God.

3057
02:06:00,910 --> 02:06:01,740
And so,
uh,

3058
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:04,920
because he was in a different position,
the referee was not in a position to

3059
02:06:04,921 --> 02:06:08,370
see.
And then corey went down and um,

3060
02:06:08,610 --> 02:06:10,500
I forget his name,
I know the dude,

3061
02:06:10,501 --> 02:06:13,770
I'm sorry.
But when his opponent was attacking him,

3062
02:06:13,771 --> 02:06:15,990
the referee hadn't realized that core
his leg,

3063
02:06:15,991 --> 02:06:17,220
it's snapped in half yet.

3064
02:06:17,550 --> 02:06:21,630
So I'm fucking screaming.
I took my headphones off and I stood up

3065
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:23,430
and I'm screaming,
stop.

3066
02:06:23,431 --> 02:06:26,580
The fight stopped the fight.
And it was,

3067
02:06:26,810 --> 02:06:27,631
did they stop it?
They heard,

3068
02:06:27,631 --> 02:06:29,070
you know,
I think he figured it out.

3069
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:31,260
I don't know if it helped I,
but I just couldn't help it.

3070
02:06:31,410 --> 02:06:33,120
I just had to jump up.
It means it was.

3071
02:06:33,570 --> 02:06:37,950
I'd only seen it on film before.
I've never seen anybody's leg snap like

3072
02:06:37,951 --> 02:06:39,090
that in real life.
Right.

3073
02:06:39,091 --> 02:06:41,200
And it's seen in a few times and
kickboxing match.

3074
02:06:41,510 --> 02:06:44,460
Oh,
you had a lot live only on video.

3075
02:06:44,550 --> 02:06:46,620
And it's like,
I can't believe the human body can do

3076
02:06:46,621 --> 02:06:47,820
that.
I knew I could do it.

3077
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:50,400
I've seen it happen a few times.
It happened to one of the best kick

3078
02:06:50,401 --> 02:06:53,730
boxers in the world.
Tyrone spong just a couple of years ago.

3079
02:06:53,731 --> 02:06:56,200
And it essentially shut his kickboxing
career now.

3080
02:06:56,670 --> 02:06:59,450
He was fighting go.
Saki was also one of the best kickbox is

3081
02:06:59,451 --> 02:07:01,710
in the world.
And go checked one of his kicks and

3082
02:07:01,711 --> 02:07:05,590
tyrone's leg just act like a joint.
Yeah.

3083
02:07:05,790 --> 02:07:08,510
And spong is just elite of the elite.
He's one of the.

3084
02:07:08,860 --> 02:07:12,270
It was like these two guys,
tyrone spong and go con sock.

3085
02:07:12,280 --> 02:07:15,510
It was like a world class,
kickboxing fight where the whole

3086
02:07:15,810 --> 02:07:19,140
kickboxing community,
like people that are like myself,

3087
02:07:19,141 --> 02:07:20,430
there are big fans were like,
whoo,

3088
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:22,380
here we go.
Here we go and see it.

3089
02:07:22,381 --> 02:07:25,800
And like that there.
When you had the Anderson one was very

3090
02:07:25,801 --> 02:07:28,920
unfortunate,
but you know that they think he broke

3091
02:07:28,921 --> 02:07:31,980
his leg actually with a kick earlier in
that round.

3092
02:07:32,070 --> 02:07:34,770
Oh yeah.
It was hurting him apparently already.

3093
02:07:34,930 --> 02:07:38,260
And then he threw that and it just
snapped in half so it might have been

3094
02:07:38,261 --> 02:07:41,710
already compromised by a similar
situation.

3095
02:07:41,710 --> 02:07:44,890
And then that one maybe like a hairline
fracture and that one just snapped it

3096
02:07:44,891 --> 02:07:48,280
all in half that I couldn't handle that.
It's rough.

3097
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:50,080
It's a rough game,
man.

3098
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:51,580
Corey Hill,
the guy,

3099
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:53,620
the first guy that had happened to,
he's dead now.

3100
02:07:53,621 --> 02:07:55,840
He died.
I don't remember what he died of,

3101
02:07:55,860 --> 02:07:57,040
but he died real young.
Yeah,

3102
02:07:57,060 --> 02:07:59,740
there's Corey Hill.
Dale Heart.

3103
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:00,880
Yeah,
that's who it is.

3104
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:03,580
Yeah.
That was a rough,

3105
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:07,390
rough fucking fight to watch men seat
snap in half like that.

3106
02:08:07,510 --> 02:08:10,600
So it's only happened twice in the UFC
in that way.

3107
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:11,573
But we've had,
you know,

3108
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:13,870
we've had a significant number of broken
bones,

3109
02:08:14,590 --> 02:08:18,100
like Frank Mir snapped Tim Silvia's arm
and half.

3110
02:08:18,130 --> 02:08:20,440
That was pretty fucked up.
I'd met Tim.

3111
02:08:20,441 --> 02:08:21,880
He was a good guy.
He's a good guy.

3112
02:08:21,910 --> 02:08:23,080
Quiet guy.
Yeah.

3113
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:24,990
He's,
you know,

3114
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:30,060
he's a guy that just didn't have like a
lot of athletic talent,

3115
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:31,030
right?

3116
02:08:31,030 --> 02:08:33,760
Just hard work,
determination and a little bit of

3117
02:08:33,761 --> 02:08:36,150
steroids and a great coach.
Yeah.

3118
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:37,350
And Pat Miletich,
she's like,

3119
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:39,310
well,
let's work with what I have and I'm

3120
02:08:39,311 --> 02:08:41,650
going to make you a champion.
That's what you did back in the day,

3121
02:08:41,651 --> 02:08:43,600
man,
when he fought Rico Rodriguez.

3122
02:08:43,601 --> 02:08:47,050
And back in the day when Mexicans
supplements were a lot easier to get

3123
02:08:47,051 --> 02:08:49,780
away with Tim.
Sylvia was a fucking destroyer.

3124
02:08:50,170 --> 02:08:55,170
Tim Silvia.
He missed like that era was the era of

3125
02:08:55,211 --> 02:08:58,570
the guys who fought in pride,
the wild West era where you could just

3126
02:08:58,571 --> 02:09:02,590
kind of do whatever the fuck you want.
If Sylvia existed in that era,

3127
02:09:02,620 --> 02:09:04,090
just Jesus Christ,
man,

3128
02:09:04,330 --> 02:09:05,890
he might've been one of the best at
best.

3129
02:09:05,891 --> 02:09:10,891
Like if you go back to like go see if
you can find Tim Silvia versus Rico

3130
02:09:11,050 --> 02:09:12,490
Rodriguez.
That's when he won the title dude.

3131
02:09:12,491 --> 02:09:16,780
He was a fucking destroyed.
He had to cut weight to make to 65.

3132
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:19,600
He was fucking 70 feet tall,
jacked.

3133
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:23,050
And this was an Tim Silvia was people
think of Tim Silvia.

3134
02:09:23,051 --> 02:09:26,200
They think of Tim Silvia being
overweight when he fought rate mercery

3135
02:09:26,230 --> 02:09:29,770
got knocked out with one punch.
You in the early days of Tim.

3136
02:09:29,771 --> 02:09:31,120
Sylvia,
when he was on top of his game,

3137
02:09:31,121 --> 02:09:33,590
he was fucking terrifying.
That's.

3138
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:36,670
See if you can find like a better photo
of it though.

3139
02:09:36,671 --> 02:09:39,370
Like you could see like how fucking huge
was.

3140
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:40,580
Yeah,
there he is right there.

3141
02:09:41,110 --> 02:09:45,700
He was jacked and so big.
That was when he fought cabbage.

3142
02:09:45,850 --> 02:09:49,360
Beat the fuck out of cattle.
I was backstage when he fought randy and

3143
02:09:49,361 --> 02:09:51,640
remember randy got him knocked out
within like 20 seconds.

3144
02:09:51,641 --> 02:09:54,610
He had him on the ground,
went through a crazy punch and branded

3145
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:56,530
it and tim didn't see coming.
It was.

3146
02:09:56,590 --> 02:09:58,090
It was insane.
Yeah.

3147
02:09:58,091 --> 02:10:00,580
Well,
Tim was friends with Randy,

3148
02:10:00,581 --> 02:10:04,780
so he was really shocked that a randy
wanted to fight him in the first place

3149
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:07,780
and that was when randy was a light
heavyweight.

3150
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:12,760
Tim was heavyweight and randy hit him
with a fake inside leg kick and a giant

3151
02:10:12,761 --> 02:10:16,390
bottle of an overhand right right away
and tim didn't even know what the fuck

3152
02:10:16,391 --> 02:10:18,700
happened.
He was out on his feet and he came back

3153
02:10:18,701 --> 02:10:20,350
to that locker room is I was all
swollen.

3154
02:10:20,351 --> 02:10:22,060
She was like,
Holy Shit.

3155
02:10:22,061 --> 02:10:24,030
I just saw you two minutes ago.
It was crazy.

3156
02:10:24,370 --> 02:10:25,790
That's the fight game.
Yeah.

3157
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,460
It's a fight game.
Yeah.

3158
02:10:27,461 --> 02:10:29,620
Tim Silvia doesn't get enough love.
It really doesn't.

3159
02:10:30,070 --> 02:10:32,230
Now I see him now.
Like it's just enormous.

3160
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:34,670
Three hundred 71 pounds.

3161
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:36,530
Yeah.
Is this a recent one?

3162
02:10:37,970 --> 02:10:40,760
When is this from it.
I don't think he's fighting anymore.

3163
02:10:40,770 --> 02:10:42,560
He's.
He does a lot of bowhunting now.

3164
02:10:42,561 --> 02:10:47,090
I think that's what he does with
medically unfit to two years ago,

3165
02:10:47,570 --> 02:10:51,320
ruled medically unfit to compete and
reality fighting because it was 371

3166
02:10:51,321 --> 02:10:52,131
pounds.
See?

3167
02:10:52,131 --> 02:10:52,964
That was.
That's.

3168
02:10:53,190 --> 02:10:56,870
That's crazy.
That means he gained a hundred 10 pounds

3169
02:10:56,871 --> 02:10:58,560
from the time he was in his prime.
He says,

3170
02:10:58,770 --> 02:10:59,630
no,
it's not good.

3171
02:11:01,070 --> 02:11:05,720
Not good,
but when he was at his best,

3172
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:08,540
he's a very under appreciated
heavyweight.

3173
02:11:08,810 --> 02:11:12,600
No,
I just think I hope I people being

3174
02:11:12,620 --> 02:11:15,950
friends with these people has helped me
out so much in regular life and they

3175
02:11:15,951 --> 02:11:18,410
talk about a lot how this carries over
and it really,

3176
02:11:18,411 --> 02:11:20,120
really does.
The way they carry themselves,

3177
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:22,190
the way they think.
Like Matt always said,

3178
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:24,380
for every move there's a counter for
every counter,

3179
02:11:24,381 --> 02:11:27,770
there's a counter and that's the kind of
thing where like if you're going to move

3180
02:11:27,771 --> 02:11:29,720
someone in your career,
you're going to have to leave some blank

3181
02:11:29,721 --> 02:11:34,520
exposed and you have to become less risk
averse and make that shot and sometimes

3182
02:11:34,521 --> 02:11:36,920
you're not gonna make that shot,
but you still have to go for it.

3183
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:40,130
Just because you see the dangerous
doesn't mean there's always going to be

3184
02:11:40,131 --> 02:11:42,050
dangerous.
You have to fucking go for it.

3185
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:45,620
Yeah.
There's definitely some lessons to be

3186
02:11:45,621 --> 02:11:49,520
learned from all martial arts training
that what I've always said is this.

3187
02:11:49,521 --> 02:11:53,230
Something that I learned from my
earliest taekwondo instructor was the

3188
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:58,010
taekwondo and all martial arts are
essentially a veil of vehicle for human

3189
02:11:58,160 --> 02:11:59,450
potential.
Devo,

3190
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:03,290
developing your human potential and that
these difficult things that you do,

3191
02:12:03,291 --> 02:12:06,260
if you can overcome them,
you'll find lessons in those that you

3192
02:12:06,261 --> 02:12:09,050
could apply to business.
Personal relationships.

3193
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:11,120
Like anything life throws at you.
Oh yeah.

3194
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:12,350
And,
and also,

3195
02:12:12,580 --> 02:12:14,030
uh,
there's a North Korean story.

3196
02:12:14,031 --> 02:12:16,790
We're in 1978,
I think there were,

3197
02:12:16,791 --> 02:12:19,070
there in the DMZ,
the border between north and South Korea

3198
02:12:19,071 --> 02:12:21,830
and the Americans wanted to chop down a
tree or to prune it.

3199
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:24,860
And the North Koreans took their ax and
chop them up and killed them.

3200
02:12:24,860 --> 02:12:26,660
That acs is on display now in North
Korea.

3201
02:12:26,661 --> 02:12:28,760
I saw it chopped up the Americans,
but they,

3202
02:12:28,790 --> 02:12:31,030
they,
they boast that they use taekwondo dell

3203
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:33,260
to,
to conquer these greater numbers of

3204
02:12:33,261 --> 02:12:34,850
Americans because it's a Korean martial
art.

3205
02:12:34,930 --> 02:12:35,800
Oh,
right.

3206
02:12:35,870 --> 02:12:38,120
They did it because they're like,
you're not chopping down this tree fund.

3207
02:12:38,121 --> 02:12:41,240
So they killed them because they wanted
to chop down a tree and they Americans

3208
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:45,290
launched Operation Paul Bunyan and came
back with like 200 guys and carriers.

3209
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:47,360
We look at job at that,
this trade and is,

3210
02:12:47,380 --> 02:12:50,570
did they left the stump to be like,
fuck you.

3211
02:12:50,810 --> 02:12:52,820
America?
Yeah.

3212
02:12:53,380 --> 02:12:54,240
Yeah.
Um,

3213
02:12:54,350 --> 02:12:59,350
I think the real issue with fighters is
making sure that they recognize that

3214
02:12:59,511 --> 02:13:04,511
father time is real and that the
expiration date is real and that there's

3215
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:07,520
only a certain amount of punishment.
The physical frame,

3216
02:13:07,790 --> 02:13:10,550
your meat vehicle that you're carrying
through this life can endure.

3217
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:12,920
And then after awhile it's downhill.
Well,

3218
02:13:12,980 --> 02:13:15,500
you know what,
that hit close to home for me because I

3219
02:13:15,501 --> 02:13:17,060
always wanted to have abs,
right?

3220
02:13:17,420 --> 02:13:19,940
And let's not laugh.
And Joe Rogan,

3221
02:13:20,870 --> 02:13:23,390
I work with my coach Dick Talents and
he's like,

3222
02:13:23,391 --> 02:13:25,400
I can get you to abs.
He got me to abs.

3223
02:13:25,450 --> 02:13:26,210
You got it.
ABS.

3224
02:13:26,210 --> 02:13:27,260
Ceos.
What's the.

3225
02:13:27,270 --> 02:13:29,060
Yeah.
I wrote an article about how getting out

3226
02:13:29,061 --> 02:13:31,000
changed my life.
You.

3227
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:34,620
Here's the spoiler was zero positive
outcome.

3228
02:13:34,830 --> 02:13:36,070
I put,
I put the APP,

3229
02:13:36,090 --> 02:13:37,800
vote on tinder.
No one fucking cared,

3230
02:13:38,130 --> 02:13:43,130
but now I have to maintain them or else
I'm going to be the men and decline and

3231
02:13:43,351 --> 02:13:45,630
I'm going to be scared.
I'm losing my peak,

3232
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:47,160
you know,
so that's something that every guy goes

3233
02:13:47,161 --> 02:13:49,170
through.
So now I'm in this fucking trap of

3234
02:13:49,171 --> 02:13:51,000
having to stick by this fucking regimen.
Okay,

3235
02:13:51,001 --> 02:13:51,960
well I can help you right there.

3236
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:53,400
How's that starts?
The way you're looking at it,

3237
02:13:53,430 --> 02:13:58,260
you're looking at it like it's trap
expectations that must be maintained,

3238
02:13:58,290 --> 02:14:00,300
right?
That's just a mind trap.

3239
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:02,460
Will have in it.
Just not.

3240
02:14:02,700 --> 02:14:03,600
You know,
you're not.

3241
02:14:03,601 --> 02:14:08,601
You could instead look only towards
always improving and don't ever think of

3242
02:14:08,611 --> 02:14:11,970
it as a trap.
Think of it as a perpetual life like

3243
02:14:12,450 --> 02:14:14,400
path.
Oh sure I am improving at.

3244
02:14:14,401 --> 02:14:17,620
The point is I can't be like this.
Body fat can increase a certain policy.

3245
02:14:17,621 --> 02:14:19,830
That's like what people do like you hear
about that.

3246
02:14:19,831 --> 02:14:23,070
When people become famous,
like when they become famous or become

3247
02:14:23,071 --> 02:14:25,080
wealthy,
they get panicky and they want to cling

3248
02:14:25,081 --> 02:14:29,940
to isolate and insulate themselves.
They lose what got them.

3249
02:14:29,941 --> 02:14:33,180
They become risk averse.
They lose what got them to the dance in

3250
02:14:33,181 --> 02:14:35,370
the first place.
My abs did not get me to any dance.

3251
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:35,880
They Florida.

3252
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:36,750
They should.
Well,

3253
02:14:36,751 --> 02:14:39,180
they showed them to the right people.
You're a single guy.

3254
02:14:39,270 --> 02:14:40,950
I am a desperate yes.
Desperately.

3255
02:14:40,951 --> 02:14:42,870
Single Guy.
Pull up that shirt and right in front of

3256
02:14:42,871 --> 02:14:45,670
that camera going to be preaching mamas
to send you.

3257
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:50,730
Send some pussy or way you could fill up
the photo that I've already had to start

3258
02:14:50,731 --> 02:14:52,800
tanning I.
I had to.

3259
02:14:52,830 --> 02:14:55,470
Yeah,
it's been required of you because I do a

3260
02:14:55,471 --> 02:14:58,890
lot of TV and my body fat was low enough
that I looked holocaust,

3261
02:14:58,891 --> 02:15:00,300
the unscreened.
Oh Jesus.

3262
02:15:01,820 --> 02:15:05,720
So your body fat.
It's low enough that I looked sick and

3263
02:15:05,721 --> 02:15:08,160
like my family,
I didn't really speak to thought I was

3264
02:15:08,161 --> 02:15:09,200
literally starving.
Cool.

3265
02:15:09,230 --> 02:15:10,950
What are you eating?
Nothing.

3266
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:12,750
Oh,
look at that dude.

3267
02:15:12,751 --> 02:15:14,250
You're good.
That's very good.

3268
02:15:14,251 --> 02:15:15,240
It's pretty good,
dude.

3269
02:15:15,241 --> 02:15:16,074
That's good.
Yeah.

3270
02:15:17,190 --> 02:15:18,480
I think you're gonna.
Get some pussy now.

3271
02:15:19,650 --> 02:15:23,580
I think so.
He's drinking monster energy drink.

3272
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:26,120
Kind of maintained his fucking
metabolome monster on the podcast.

3273
02:15:26,140 --> 02:15:27,470
Monster in the bedroom.
This.

3274
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:29,050
Oh,
you son of a bitch.

3275
02:15:29,051 --> 02:15:31,110
I just mean it like choking.
That's the sugar stuff.

3276
02:15:31,530 --> 02:15:34,260
Sugar,
sugar freestyle with low sugar,

3277
02:15:34,261 --> 02:15:35,370
low carb,
low carb.

3278
02:15:35,650 --> 02:15:36,460
Scammy.
Joe.

3279
02:15:36,460 --> 02:15:37,710
It was a little bit of sugar,
right?

3280
02:15:37,780 --> 02:15:41,550
It's 10 calories for the can.
I mean 10 grams or calories.

3281
02:15:41,580 --> 02:15:43,650
Ten grams of sugar.
10,

3282
02:15:43,890 --> 02:15:45,540
25 calories for the can.
Oh,

3283
02:15:45,541 --> 02:15:46,111
that's not bad.
Yeah.

3284
02:15:46,111 --> 02:15:47,580
Yeah.
There's nothing.

3285
02:15:47,610 --> 02:15:50,190
There's seven grams of carbs.
Those things are tasty.

3286
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:51,890
They're a little too tasty.
I can't drink those.

3287
02:15:52,170 --> 02:15:54,630
That's a sponsor of the UFC,
so they always had them laying around

3288
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:56,940
and some.
So sometimes I'll drink one during a

3289
02:15:56,941 --> 02:15:58,980
broadcast,
but then you have to fucking pee.

3290
02:15:59,190 --> 02:16:01,190
The problem is that stuff runs through
you fast.

3291
02:16:01,220 --> 02:16:03,610
Thanks for telling me that.
As I'm sitting here initially.

3292
02:16:04,110 --> 02:16:06,910
I know on the stomach.
Hang in there.

3293
02:16:06,980 --> 02:16:09,210
I can hang in there.
It's 4:00.

3294
02:16:09,211 --> 02:16:11,160
I'm thinking we're going to go for
another like 15 minutes.

3295
02:16:11,161 --> 02:16:12,140
Perfect.
Really?

3296
02:16:13,250 --> 02:16:15,090
Do we just.
Wow.

3297
02:16:15,250 --> 02:16:17,790
Got.
We've got to do this format.

3298
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:20,190
This Sean,
you're a Brooklyn guy.

3299
02:16:20,191 --> 02:16:21,510
You live in New York.
I Love Brooklyn.

3300
02:16:21,511 --> 02:16:22,111
Yes.
How long are you gonna?

3301
02:16:22,111 --> 02:16:24,270
Be on here for A.
I just left for a couple of days.

3302
02:16:24,420 --> 02:16:25,050
Oh,
beautiful.

3303
02:16:25,050 --> 02:16:26,010
Yeah.
You got any plans?

3304
02:16:26,011 --> 02:16:28,390
What are you gonna do when you're out
here and hanging out with my buddy matt,

3305
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:29,980
who you know,
he's an internet

3306
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:33,730
personality.
I'm just going to do just some work and

3307
02:16:33,731 --> 02:16:36,010
that's it.
Just experienced life on the west coast.

3308
02:16:36,090 --> 02:16:38,830
I'm not an la fan to know what bothers
you about.

3309
02:16:38,870 --> 02:16:41,620
There's a certain corruption about it.
Corruption.

3310
02:16:41,621 --> 02:16:45,070
Yeah.
I feel like there's a veneer of sunshine

3311
02:16:45,071 --> 02:16:47,690
and stability,
but underneath that there's a lot of a

3312
02:16:48,070 --> 02:16:53,070
fakeness and and nastiness and I new
Yorkers were more direct and more

3313
02:16:54,071 --> 02:16:55,750
surface.
That's interesting.

3314
02:16:55,751 --> 02:16:57,930
Fakeness and nastiness.
How so?

3315
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,490
Meaning like when I meet people in La
and they're like,

3316
02:17:00,491 --> 02:17:01,121
Oh,
you're an author.

3317
02:17:01,121 --> 02:17:03,010
Like I'm sorry I haven't heard any of
your books.

3318
02:17:03,011 --> 02:17:03,761
It's like,
why the fuck are you?

3319
02:17:03,761 --> 02:17:04,540
Sorry,
I'm nobody.

3320
02:17:04,540 --> 02:17:06,010
Do you know what I mean?
Like that kind of thing.

3321
02:17:06,190 --> 02:17:07,990
So they don't.
They're scared of offending someone in

3322
02:17:07,991 --> 02:17:11,950
case that might be important
or it's like we should definitely grab

3323
02:17:11,951 --> 02:17:13,540
lunch,
meaning good to see you,

3324
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:15,550
but it doesn't mean literally we should
grab lunch.

3325
02:17:15,550 --> 02:17:20,500
It's all these codes that you could find
a losers like that New York to pull.

3326
02:17:20,501 --> 02:17:23,550
I'm not hanging out with them.
I guess they met the wrong people in la.

3327
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:25,420
Are you meeting them then?
What do you mean?

3328
02:17:25,421 --> 02:17:26,021
In New York?
Well,

3329
02:17:26,021 --> 02:17:27,430
no,
you're generalizing like you're

3330
02:17:27,431 --> 02:17:29,680
generalizing these people that you're
meeting that they're worried about

3331
02:17:29,681 --> 02:17:31,150
offending you.
It's it.

3332
02:17:31,380 --> 02:17:33,910
It's happened enough that it's part of
the culture here.

3333
02:17:33,940 --> 02:17:36,610
It's not just one data point Joe Rogan
and it's just like.

3334
02:17:36,780 --> 02:17:40,150
It's jarring to me.
I'm not used to it from Brooklyn.

3335
02:17:40,151 --> 02:17:41,860
You're a big fan of that data point
line.

3336
02:17:42,020 --> 02:17:42,810
I,
yeah,

3337
02:17:42,810 --> 02:17:44,190
I,
I mean,

3338
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:47,170
but you're limited data points and how
many people you meet.

3339
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:49,210
How often are you here?
Twenty 4 million,

3340
02:17:49,560 --> 02:17:50,870
25.
All of them.

3341
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:54,010
How often do you here?
For like once a year.

3342
02:17:54,140 --> 02:17:57,700
Yeah.
I think the thing about La is there's

3343
02:17:57,730 --> 02:18:01,480
pockets of humanity,
like these voices of interesting people

3344
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:02,530
and I,
I,

3345
02:18:02,530 --> 02:18:04,510
I'm a cultivator of interesting people.

3346
02:18:04,510 --> 02:18:06,700
I like to like when I find them,
I cleaned to them.

3347
02:18:06,701 --> 02:18:08,410
The problem is yes,
that's my approach.

3348
02:18:08,411 --> 02:18:10,660
There's always someone that's trying to
get into that group.

3349
02:18:10,690 --> 02:18:12,550
That's not right.
Yes.

3350
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:13,680
Yeah.
Entry Ism.

3351
02:18:13,810 --> 02:18:15,640
Yeah.
And then you know,

3352
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:18,130
and that they bring their crew and it's
been a.

3353
02:18:18,131 --> 02:18:20,560
it's infected.
Yeah.

3354
02:18:20,561 --> 02:18:24,220
It becomes an issue and especially
amongst comedians becomes an issue.

3355
02:18:24,250 --> 02:18:26,710
Oh God,
they want to work with you and do shows

3356
02:18:26,711 --> 02:18:27,850
with you and stuff like that.
And you're like,

3357
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:29,770
hey.
The same happened.

3358
02:18:29,771 --> 02:18:30,340
And I,
I,

3359
02:18:30,340 --> 02:18:35,340
I did two books with dl Hughley who's
also an amazingly wonderful person and I

3360
02:18:36,371 --> 02:18:39,350
didn't see that much around him.
Like he hangs with their various crew.

3361
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:41,050
He's very smart,
very smart.

3362
02:18:41,470 --> 02:18:43,930
I learned a lot from him.
He's not suffering any fools.

3363
02:18:43,960 --> 02:18:45,010
No,
exactly.

3364
02:18:45,011 --> 02:18:47,860
And it's also really fun being the white
guy with a group of black people going

3365
02:18:47,861 --> 02:18:49,120
to a club or something like that.

3366
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:54,070
And then when she use the n word I,
it's in the chapter in the first book

3367
02:18:54,071 --> 02:18:56,710
about it.
Which book that I did two books with

3368
02:18:56,711 --> 02:18:58,420
him.
The first call I want you to shut the

3369
02:18:58,421 --> 02:18:59,780
fuck up.
And he said,

3370
02:18:59,870 --> 02:19:03,790
Uncle Sam on the cover.
That's the book I want you to shut the

3371
02:19:03,791 --> 02:19:05,110
fuck up.
That is hilarious.

3372
02:19:05,111 --> 02:19:07,240
Title for a book.
The second one's called black man.

3373
02:19:07,241 --> 02:19:10,510
White House.
I came up with both those titles and

3374
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:12,900
their and I want you to shut the fuck up
as a very good time.

3375
02:19:12,901 --> 02:19:16,070
I want you to shut the fuck up.
He's Uncle Sam on the kind of.

3376
02:19:16,630 --> 02:19:18,400
Yeah,
I learned a lot from him.

3377
02:19:18,401 --> 02:19:19,330
Also.
Just a great,

3378
02:19:19,331 --> 02:19:20,630
great guy.
Yeah,

3379
02:19:20,710 --> 02:19:23,020
he's a good dude.
He's a decent guy.

3380
02:19:23,410 --> 02:19:26,140
Like I'm sure you know all the comedians
and who were the assholes behind the

3381
02:19:26,141 --> 02:19:28,730
scenes and who aren't and don't think
anyone thinks badly of him.

3382
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:30,740
He's very.
Whereas this hardness sleeve.

3383
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:31,611
Yeah.
I don't know.

3384
02:19:31,611 --> 02:19:33,890
Deal that well.
I've run into him a few times and had

3385
02:19:33,891 --> 02:19:35,870
good conversations with him and he's
always been very nice,

3386
02:19:36,290 --> 02:19:38,240
but you're right.
I don't ever hear bad things.

3387
02:19:38,720 --> 02:19:41,180
He's a mench.
A mench is interesting.

3388
02:19:41,590 --> 02:19:46,150
I want to know is that I have.
I actually have a blowup of that firm.

3389
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:50,230
We did a book signing and he signed it
to me over my instructions to my Nigga

3390
02:19:50,230 --> 02:19:52,430
Michael Nicholas piece pimping.
It's hanging up in the house.

3391
02:19:52,431 --> 02:19:53,270
Isn't that great?
There's my name,

3392
02:19:53,330 --> 02:19:56,780
little desk.
Audacity of dopes is ruining America.

3393
02:19:56,781 --> 02:19:59,030
That's hilarious.
I love how you can say fuck,

3394
02:19:59,031 --> 02:20:02,450
as long as you put it in like a pound
sign for the you will.

3395
02:20:02,451 --> 02:20:05,750
They wanted a curse because there was a
book called go the fuck to sleep,

3396
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:08,240
which did huge.
So they're like,

3397
02:20:08,241 --> 02:20:09,730
okay,
we need a curse in the title.

3398
02:20:09,730 --> 02:20:10,490
I'm like,
all right,

3399
02:20:10,490 --> 02:20:14,120
so offensive to me that you can cover up
one letter and everybody's like,

3400
02:20:14,121 --> 02:20:14,930
okay,
we're good.

3401
02:20:14,930 --> 02:20:16,040
Yeah,
no my friends,

3402
02:20:16,041 --> 02:20:19,430
new book's going to call fuck whales.
Like fuck whales and all these other

3403
02:20:19,431 --> 02:20:21,810
shit.
You know an f f has a pound signs like,

3404
02:20:21,811 --> 02:20:23,990
oh well this is spot and I'll put this
on the shelf in the supermarket.

3405
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:24,920
Isn't it funny?
Yeah.

3406
02:20:24,990 --> 02:20:26,990
You could just do that.
Such child.

3407
02:20:27,020 --> 02:20:30,470
No language has changed because we used
to not be able to say fuck.

3408
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:32,990
And now we can't say the n word,
but it's when we were kids it was,

3409
02:20:32,991 --> 02:20:33,890
fuck.
That was the problem.

3410
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:36,290
You'd never seen writing ever while you
did.

3411
02:20:36,350 --> 02:20:39,050
Did Archie Bunker's say the n word on
all in the family?

3412
02:20:39,051 --> 02:20:41,060
He must have.
I would imagine he did.

3413
02:20:41,061 --> 02:20:46,061
I know that a Fred Redd Foxx did redd
foxx did on Sanford and sons because I

3414
02:20:46,630 --> 02:20:51,220
remember I remember him saying it about
like,

3415
02:20:51,230 --> 02:20:53,030
I think it was like a jury.

3416
02:20:53,850 --> 02:20:56,990
I think it was like during a trial or
something like that.

3417
02:20:58,190 --> 02:21:00,170
I'm trying to remember what the line
was,

3418
02:21:00,290 --> 02:21:02,900
but it was.
He said the last time I saw this many

3419
02:21:02,901 --> 02:21:05,600
niggers was in a Tarzan movie and I'm
like,

3420
02:21:05,930 --> 02:21:08,000
fuck,
did they put that on tv?

3421
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:11,540
But it was a different world and it was
Red Fox who's by the way,

3422
02:21:11,541 --> 02:21:15,770
like almost like,
I mean him and Richard Pryor.

3423
02:21:15,850 --> 02:21:20,210
We're like one of two of the most
important figures of like black standup

3424
02:21:20,211 --> 02:21:22,160
comedy of any standup comedy.
Yeah,

3425
02:21:22,220 --> 02:21:24,260
for sure.
I mean the comedians are the ones who

3426
02:21:24,261 --> 02:21:28,010
are always pushing the envelope and
that's their job and it enrages me when

3427
02:21:28,011 --> 02:21:29,570
people are trying to.
That's not fun.

3428
02:21:29,610 --> 02:21:32,150
I have my next book.
I have this whole chapter about that's

3429
02:21:32,151 --> 02:21:33,620
not funny.
That's like I knew a North Korean

3430
02:21:33,621 --> 02:21:36,860
refugee and he would,
he went to high school here and he'd be

3431
02:21:36,861 --> 02:21:38,210
hanging out with his friends and they'd
be like,

3432
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:39,500
Hey,
remember when we were kids there was

3433
02:21:39,501 --> 02:21:40,040
pokemon.

3434
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:40,851
He'd be like,
yeah,

3435
02:21:40,851 --> 02:21:43,700
except instead of Pokemon,
I watched my debts starve to death along

3436
02:21:43,701 --> 02:21:47,570
with most of my village.
So you have that dark sense of humor.

3437
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:49,820
He joked around about that because you
have to,

3438
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:51,020
like,
you come from that culture.

3439
02:21:51,021 --> 02:21:53,750
If you don't laugh,
you're not going to be able to kind of

3440
02:21:53,751 --> 02:21:56,030
deal with it.
So you're going to tell him he can't

3441
02:21:56,031 --> 02:21:57,770
joke about starbuck,
his starving family.

3442
02:21:57,771 --> 02:21:59,660
Who the fuck are you?
Why did that guy get out?

3443
02:21:59,960 --> 02:22:00,411
Uh,
you,

3444
02:22:00,411 --> 02:22:02,930
he escaped to China.
He was basically a slave.

3445
02:22:02,931 --> 02:22:05,570
A woman kind of found him.
She was a Christian.

3446
02:22:05,571 --> 02:22:08,480
There's a bit Christian population in
China and then it's a whole process.

3447
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:10,190
Wow.
How do you escape the China?

3448
02:22:10,191 --> 02:22:12,890
Did he bribed the guards in the middle?
During the day?

3449
02:22:12,891 --> 02:22:15,810
He just crossed the Tumen River and they
just happen not to see him,

3450
02:22:15,811 --> 02:22:16,644
but he's a kid.

3451
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:18,110
How old was he?
I mean,

3452
02:22:18,111 --> 02:22:21,080
he was under 16 and over 11,
somewhere in that range.

3453
02:22:21,170 --> 02:22:24,260
So when you,
when someone from your family escapes,

3454
02:22:24,261 --> 02:22:26,610
your whole family's punished.
So the great leader,

3455
02:22:26,611 --> 02:22:29,730
Kim Il Sung said class enemies must be
exterminated.

3456
02:22:29,731 --> 02:22:30,930
Two,
three generations.

3457
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:33,780
So in America,
when people like Rick Santorum say the

3458
02:22:33,781 --> 02:22:36,600
families,
the basic unit of society unit means

3459
02:22:36,601 --> 02:22:39,540
that which can't be subdivided further.
They put that into practice.

3460
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:41,700
So if someone from your family,
there's something wrong,

3461
02:22:41,701 --> 02:22:45,030
three generations are punished.
So if someone escapes,

3462
02:22:45,210 --> 02:22:47,610
that's going to be really bad for use.
They often get fake.

3463
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:49,380
They bribed someone to get a fake death
certificate.

3464
02:22:50,930 --> 02:22:55,050
Yeah.
So someone escapes your parents and then

3465
02:22:55,140 --> 02:22:58,140
grandparents were kids or siblings,
kids or anybody.

3466
02:22:58,141 --> 02:23:02,580
Whoever the fuck can be around is
imprisoned or deported to some

3467
02:23:03,030 --> 02:23:04,620
countryside.
Like if you're in Pyongyang,

3468
02:23:05,460 --> 02:23:07,710
there's something called Sung Monday,
have a caste system,

3469
02:23:07,711 --> 02:23:08,190
right?

3470
02:23:08,190 --> 02:23:10,590
Which has three layers,
which is how loyal you are to the

3471
02:23:10,591 --> 02:23:13,680
government and that determines where you
can live in the country and what your

3472
02:23:13,681 --> 02:23:15,780
job could be.
So you're not allowed to step foot in

3473
02:23:15,781 --> 02:23:18,360
the capital city unless you're loyal to
the regime.

3474
02:23:18,630 --> 02:23:21,660
So what happens is if you're from
Pyongyang and you defect,

3475
02:23:21,930 --> 02:23:24,270
your family's going to get sent to Lex
bumble,

3476
02:23:24,271 --> 02:23:24,960
fuck,
you know,

3477
02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:27,090
who knows?
And now you've got to raise rice and

3478
02:23:27,091 --> 02:23:30,690
anyone from North Korea who's an
ambassador,

3479
02:23:30,870 --> 02:23:33,870
they have family back there.
So make sure that you don't make any

3480
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:35,910
mistakes and try to stay in that
country.

3481
02:23:37,110 --> 02:23:39,750
Yes,
they have layers upon layers of control.

3482
02:23:39,751 --> 02:23:41,700
They're brilliant at it.
It's horrific,

3483
02:23:41,701 --> 02:23:42,511
but brilliant,
right?

3484
02:23:42,511 --> 02:23:43,231
Yes.
Yeah,

3485
02:23:43,231 --> 02:23:45,030
they're,
I mean these are really the supermind

3486
02:23:45,031 --> 02:23:47,250
master,
the super villains of our time,

3487
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:49,800
horrific and its execution,
but brilliant.

3488
02:23:49,860 --> 02:23:52,800
And it's the whole master plan of it.

3489
02:23:53,910 --> 02:23:56,280
Other things,
do they tell people don't wear ripped

3490
02:23:56,281 --> 02:24:00,300
jeans to the DMZ because North Korea
takes these photos and shows US citizens

3491
02:24:00,301 --> 02:24:03,030
go look before the rest of the country,
rest of the world dressed in rags.

3492
02:24:03,430 --> 02:24:04,740
Wow,
that's a brilliant,

3493
02:24:05,220 --> 02:24:06,810
brilliant.
It's absolutely brilliant.

3494
02:24:06,870 --> 02:24:10,770
It is Alaris that were so wealthy in
America that we buy jeans that are

3495
02:24:10,771 --> 02:24:15,090
already scratched up or like acid,
like let's just put acid on your genes.

3496
02:24:15,091 --> 02:24:15,960
All right,
that's fine.

3497
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:19,410
I was watching this video online about
how they make those,

3498
02:24:19,430 --> 02:24:21,570
uh,
what's the word that they use for

3499
02:24:21,580 --> 02:24:26,120
distress is stress where they were
taking like a sander blasting and she's

3500
02:24:26,130 --> 02:24:27,480
like,
what the fuck are we doing?

3501
02:24:27,770 --> 02:24:30,150
I went into this whole gene,
a phase.

3502
02:24:30,151 --> 02:24:32,070
I got 30 pairs because I thought it was
just.

3503
02:24:32,071 --> 02:24:34,620
I started collecting them and then I
got.

3504
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:36,690
The point is when they're raw,
you wear them,

3505
02:24:36,691 --> 02:24:38,640
the ink breaks down and they distress in
their own.

3506
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:42,660
They get these cool fades and I wore my
best pair to like this fancy denim store

3507
02:24:42,661 --> 02:24:45,330
in La and no one praise me.
And I'm like,

3508
02:24:45,331 --> 02:24:49,290
fuck you in this subculture.
And I know one praised you upset.

3509
02:24:49,320 --> 02:24:51,060
Yeah.
At the last parent earth have these

3510
02:24:51,090 --> 02:24:52,440
persimmon died.
You know,

3511
02:24:52,441 --> 02:24:54,960
Japanese do at the time.
This is like two years ago,

3512
02:24:56,840 --> 02:24:59,660
they were cocky sheebu man.
What does that hockey she boo.

3513
02:24:59,670 --> 02:25:03,410
It's unripened persimmon die.
I don't know what that is.

3514
02:25:03,460 --> 02:25:05,520
That person is a person that a person is
a fruit,

3515
02:25:05,521 --> 02:25:05,940
right?
Right.

3516
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:09,840
So they take the unripened juice,
they soak the clothing in it and it

3517
02:25:09,841 --> 02:25:12,750
becomes this pinkish Orange Hue.
And this co company,

3518
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:15,810
sugarcane made jeans that color and they
looked pinkish orange,

3519
02:25:15,811 --> 02:25:17,880
you and they look sick.
They look amazing.

3520
02:25:18,510 --> 02:25:20,460
I know what you're single.
Is that right?

3521
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:23,920
Because that'll just.
That'll show the abs personal fucking

3522
02:25:23,950 --> 02:25:24,520
stained

3523
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:26,560
genes that you're worried about being
praised for.

3524
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:33,160
That was about the ones that call me.
I've got Sour Samurai jeans,

3525
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:37,930
Khakis.
Shubie died 24 ounce cocktail Shubu.

3526
02:25:37,931 --> 02:25:39,190
Sorry.
I got the sugar cane.

3527
02:25:39,191 --> 02:25:41,350
One 24 ounce.
I liked how they weigh them.

3528
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:43,090
Like who gives a fuck how much there was
that?

3529
02:25:43,091 --> 02:25:44,890
The heavier the gene,
the better.

3530
02:25:44,891 --> 02:25:47,200
The fades.
A interesting.

3531
02:25:47,290 --> 02:25:48,640
Yeah.
Huh.

3532
02:25:49,090 --> 02:25:52,420
Okay.
See those kinds of genes don't interest

3533
02:25:52,421 --> 02:25:54,730
me because they.
They seem like it's hard to move around

3534
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:55,140
them.
No.

3535
02:25:55,140 --> 02:25:57,070
Well that's when you break them down.
That's the whole point.

3536
02:25:57,250 --> 02:25:58,480
Yeah.
But they're not like,

3537
02:25:58,710 --> 02:25:59,321
like,
you know what?

3538
02:25:59,321 --> 02:26:01,390
These are right here.
These are barbell jeans.

3539
02:26:01,510 --> 02:26:01,901
Oh yeah.
Yeah,

3540
02:26:01,901 --> 02:26:02,651
I know about those.
Yeah.

3541
02:26:02,651 --> 02:26:05,650
They stretch for big quads.
Do these are like fucking sweatpants,

3542
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:06,700
man.
Throw head kicks.

3543
02:26:06,701 --> 02:26:07,870
Wearing these,
these.

3544
02:26:08,230 --> 02:26:10,180
I like these.
And there's another company called Mott

3545
02:26:10,181 --> 02:26:10,930
and bow.

3546
02:26:10,930 --> 02:26:12,900
They make them and they're like a little
bit thicker.

3547
02:26:12,970 --> 02:26:16,330
They a more expensive pair of jeans,
but it has the same sort of stretch

3548
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:18,450
flexy thing.
That's the kind of Shit I liked it.

3549
02:26:18,550 --> 02:26:20,020
Well,
the company I like called naked and

3550
02:26:20,021 --> 02:26:20,920
famous,
they're Canadian.

3551
02:26:20,921 --> 02:26:23,890
They have genes that change colors.
He knows naked and famous.

3552
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:25,510
They've got A.
I've got a fuck ton of them,

3553
02:26:25,511 --> 02:26:28,390
but they don't.
They're not salmon colored Khaki Shubu

3554
02:26:28,620 --> 02:26:29,800
fucking.
That's true.

3555
02:26:29,801 --> 02:26:31,930
And that looks like sugar cubes are
ridiculous.

3556
02:26:32,030 --> 02:26:34,470
I've got the mud dive.
I got 30 pairs.

3557
02:26:34,480 --> 02:26:36,130
Man.
I just love the fact that you were

3558
02:26:36,131 --> 02:26:40,300
bummed out that nobody prays.
You have no idea.

3559
02:26:42,050 --> 02:26:45,010
It's so honest though.
It's so ridiculous.

3560
02:26:45,620 --> 02:26:48,360
That was the Khaki Shiva.
There was no praise that.

3561
02:26:49,860 --> 02:26:52,630
Who would know the guy at the denim
stores should fucking know.

3562
02:26:53,620 --> 02:26:55,930
That's the one guy who should know
Jamie,

3563
02:26:56,410 --> 02:26:58,480
Jamie.
Whereas Kanye West sneakers.

3564
02:26:58,540 --> 02:26:59,710
That's not.
That's not the whole.

3565
02:26:59,711 --> 02:27:01,690
That's a whole different vibe.
That's basic shit.

3566
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:02,260
No,
no,

3567
02:27:02,260 --> 02:27:03,880
no.
This is a little.

3568
02:27:04,030 --> 02:27:04,990
It is.
It is.

3569
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:06,400
Come on.
I like the hipster stuff.

3570
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:09,720
Shit.
I don't have the actual crazies that are

3571
02:27:09,730 --> 02:27:10,910
like 5,080.
Oh,

3572
02:27:10,970 --> 02:27:12,160
come on.
They have 5,000,

3573
02:27:12,161 --> 02:27:15,910
$8,000 dollars wants to make.
I'm not a fan.

3574
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,430
Not a fan either.
You've got a real collector.

3575
02:27:18,431 --> 02:27:21,060
Gets the stuff that's not that expensive
but is really unique and khaki.

3576
02:27:21,061 --> 02:27:23,560
Shibu is cocky shape.
Do you still wear them or you just

3577
02:27:24,460 --> 02:27:28,120
praise?
I cry and I was gonna Ram today and I'm

3578
02:27:28,121 --> 02:27:29,110
like,
am I gonna wear today?

3579
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:30,940
Nobody brought them up.
I know.

3580
02:27:31,090 --> 02:27:32,020
I know.
Set I.

3581
02:27:32,030 --> 02:27:35,140
I navy.
But you don't seem like a Fashionista.

3582
02:27:35,141 --> 02:27:38,830
You don't seem like the guys who made
the shirt you're wearing,

3583
02:27:38,980 --> 02:27:41,680
man.
It's got epilepsy.

3584
02:27:41,740 --> 02:27:42,670
Oh,
it's good for ugly people.

3585
02:27:42,670 --> 02:27:47,070
Then you're saying you're saying people
who are going to end up,

3586
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:49,330
you know how like board games or like
ages five and up.

3587
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:51,040
So this is ugly and up.
Oh,

3588
02:27:51,041 --> 02:27:51,874
I get it.
Yeah.

3589
02:27:52,360 --> 02:27:54,820
I mean it's not a terrible shirt but
it's,

3590
02:27:55,420 --> 02:27:57,640
you know.
I mean if you're into really being

3591
02:27:57,641 --> 02:27:59,470
praised for your clothes,
I wouldn't imagine that would be your

3592
02:27:59,471 --> 02:28:01,060
best choice.
Well,

3593
02:28:01,061 --> 02:28:03,700
I was going to wear a suit.
I wear suits on,

3594
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:06,910
on Fox all the time and I'm probably one
of the best dressed people network.

3595
02:28:07,150 --> 02:28:09,130
Do you enjoy being on Fox?
I love it.

3596
02:28:09,310 --> 02:28:10,031
Really?
Oh,

3597
02:28:10,031 --> 02:28:11,140
I love it.
Why?

3598
02:28:11,650 --> 02:28:15,490
Because I get to be the same thing that
gets me in trouble at parties and I'm

3599
02:28:15,491 --> 02:28:17,650
rewarded for it.
What is the thing that gets you in

3600
02:28:17,651 --> 02:28:19,240
trouble at parties?
Vicious?

3601
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:22,370
Uh,
if this rating denigrating

3602
02:28:22,370 --> 02:28:24,410
all these things,
like the nasty.

3603
02:28:24,411 --> 02:28:25,930
It's so fun.
What do you,

3604
02:28:25,990 --> 02:28:28,280
why do you like doing that?
Because I think there's a lot of

3605
02:28:28,281 --> 02:28:31,160
horrible people and they need to be
called out on their bullshit and I'm in

3606
02:28:31,161 --> 02:28:34,970
a position to do it.
What kind of arguments do you have on

3607
02:28:34,971 --> 02:28:36,340
file?
I've never seen you on Fox for.

3608
02:28:36,350 --> 02:28:37,370
Well,
I don't watch too much.

3609
02:28:38,110 --> 02:28:38,990
It's fine.
I just,

3610
02:28:38,991 --> 02:28:40,400
I,
it's just like if I'm talking about

3611
02:28:40,401 --> 02:28:42,160
politicians,
I always make it a point to be as

3612
02:28:42,350 --> 02:28:44,630
denigrating and humiliate and to them
personally as possible.

3613
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:46,250
But when you're talking to them
personally,

3614
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:48,050
not personally,
but we're talking about them.

3615
02:28:48,051 --> 02:28:50,000
Whatever the issue is.
I'm not usually in paddle actual

3616
02:28:50,001 --> 02:28:52,310
politicians.
I was on with John Bolton ones,

3617
02:28:52,311 --> 02:28:54,470
which was weird,
but I mean I go,

3618
02:28:54,530 --> 02:28:55,820
I'm out.
I'm shopping for blood,

3619
02:28:56,060 --> 02:28:57,010
you know,
with these types,

3620
02:28:57,460 --> 02:29:01,490
someone's got to be Batman and punching
these people in the face metaphorically.

3621
02:29:01,550 --> 02:29:02,470
Metaphorically.
Yeah.

3622
02:29:03,020 --> 02:29:06,400
So you enjoy it because it gives you an
opportunity to intervene.

3623
02:29:06,650 --> 02:29:09,000
Yeah,
send a message home to will it to be

3624
02:29:09,020 --> 02:29:10,010
mean.
Which I'm good at,

3625
02:29:10,011 --> 02:29:12,560
but it's not culturally socially
acceptable.

3626
02:29:12,561 --> 02:29:15,980
This is why I don't drink because you're
afraid you're going to be more mean.

3627
02:29:15,981 --> 02:29:16,980
I got meaner.
Yeah.

3628
02:29:17,420 --> 02:29:20,840
Oh yeah.
And the thing is I'm really funny for

3629
02:29:20,841 --> 02:29:23,480
people who just listen to you.
You gave me like the sideways looking

3630
02:29:23,481 --> 02:29:24,470
through your eyebrows.
Oh yeah.

3631
02:29:25,110 --> 02:29:26,810
But that's the thing like my,
my,

3632
02:29:26,900 --> 02:29:27,500
my,
my,

3633
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:29,570
my,
my mouth is very quick so I'll have that

3634
02:29:29,571 --> 02:29:32,270
good line and the next day I'm like,
that person's going to feel like shit

3635
02:29:32,271 --> 02:29:34,210
and I shouldn't have said it.
Oh yeah.

3636
02:29:34,310 --> 02:29:35,890
And that they don't deserve that at a
party.

3637
02:29:36,760 --> 02:29:39,410
But you're meant it.
At the time I met the joke,

3638
02:29:39,480 --> 02:29:41,360
it came out.
I mean the joke landed.

3639
02:29:41,870 --> 02:29:43,280
Well,
that's the thing about hanging out with

3640
02:29:43,281 --> 02:29:44,960
comedians to like,
you know,

3641
02:29:44,961 --> 02:29:46,480
you know,
a lot of comics that I know,

3642
02:29:46,540 --> 02:29:49,280
but you can kind of get away with that,
like you could shit on a comic and if

3643
02:29:49,281 --> 02:29:51,950
it's funny they'll laugh with you,
but if it's a regular person,

3644
02:29:51,951 --> 02:29:53,820
especially a female,
you don't want to do that.

3645
02:29:54,170 --> 02:29:57,640
They don't deserve it at all and I feel
guilty for a long time and I shouldn't

3646
02:29:57,641 --> 02:29:59,360
feel guilty.
I should feel guilty,

3647
02:29:59,390 --> 02:30:01,130
especially if they're not used to it.
Yeah.

3648
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:03,140
And especially if they come at you
thinking,

3649
02:30:03,170 --> 02:30:05,150
oh my friends tell me I'm funny,
and it's just like,

3650
02:30:05,180 --> 02:30:08,610
well you started the wrong fucking war.
Yeah.

3651
02:30:08,840 --> 02:30:11,150
Maybe they could make fun of your genes
and it really hurt you.

3652
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:14,630
They wouldn't have those sheebu.
They wouldn't have the language to do so

3653
02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:15,650
they wouldn't know the language.

3654
02:30:16,360 --> 02:30:18,950
Shibu is it?
Was it that obscure?

3655
02:30:19,220 --> 02:30:19,671
Well,
ted,

3656
02:30:19,671 --> 02:30:21,320
you heard of it.
I don't know anything man.

3657
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:23,450
You don't even know the rules to
basketball.

3658
02:30:24,690 --> 02:30:25,523
Khaki.
She was.

3659
02:30:25,730 --> 02:30:28,340
The reason why those jeans are awesome
is because they're obscure.

3660
02:30:28,490 --> 02:30:30,950
Oh,
that's one of those guys.

3661
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:32,480
Yeah,
things rare things are good.

3662
02:30:32,490 --> 02:30:34,730
One hundred percent,
a hundred percent.

3663
02:30:34,910 --> 02:30:36,560
Are you a car guy?
You're interested in?

3664
02:30:36,940 --> 02:30:38,690
I don't know how to drive.
Because you're in New York City.

3665
02:30:38,691 --> 02:30:39,524
Yeah.
Yeah.

3666
02:30:39,890 --> 02:30:41,600
That's weird.
But at like rare plants.

3667
02:30:41,630 --> 02:30:46,130
Rare fish or you're just in a rare shit.
I like having stuff that's only your own

3668
02:30:46,190 --> 02:30:48,470
because when everyone puts their sticky
fingers on it,

3669
02:30:48,471 --> 02:30:51,830
it ruins it.
So like if you really like something,

3670
02:30:51,831 --> 02:30:53,750
be fine.
Other people like it as well and become

3671
02:30:53,780 --> 02:30:55,130
popular.
You get upset.

3672
02:30:55,131 --> 02:30:56,840
Hell on earth.
Are you one of those dudes that gets

3673
02:30:56,841 --> 02:30:58,310
bombed out with a bang?
It's popular.

3674
02:30:59,060 --> 02:31:02,330
It's the worst thing ever.
It's the worst thing.

3675
02:31:02,360 --> 02:31:04,380
It hurts me physically.
It doesn't really.

3676
02:31:04,381 --> 02:31:05,071
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

3677
02:31:05,071 --> 02:31:08,180
It's so silly though.
They're silly because then stupid people

3678
02:31:08,181 --> 02:31:09,770
are liking what you like and then you've
got a question.

3679
02:31:09,771 --> 02:31:11,840
Your choices.
That's stupid.

3680
02:31:11,841 --> 02:31:13,850
People like all sorts of stuff.
That's awesome.

3681
02:31:13,870 --> 02:31:14,571
But if.
Yeah,

3682
02:31:14,571 --> 02:31:16,760
but incorrectly,
they like it for the wrong reasons.

3683
02:31:16,790 --> 02:31:19,040
What about ice cream with have stupid
people like chocolate ice.

3684
02:31:19,290 --> 02:31:20,100
You can calculate what

3685
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:21,450
the hell it can kind of.
Crazy person.

3686
02:31:21,451 --> 02:31:23,190
Are you that you don't like chocolate?
No.

3687
02:31:23,220 --> 02:31:26,340
My favorite ice cream is pink,
is pink bubblegum from Baskin Robbins

3688
02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:30,210
and I fucking had to go to every baskin
Robbins and Manhattan trying to find it

3689
02:31:30,211 --> 02:31:32,610
every year.
And it drives me crazy.

3690
02:31:32,611 --> 02:31:34,800
I go on my instagram,
I finally found it.

3691
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:37,080
Yeah,
but there's nothing wrong with chocolate

3692
02:31:37,110 --> 02:31:39,600
like you don't like chocolate ice cream.
Chocolate ice cream was God damn

3693
02:31:39,601 --> 02:31:41,160
delicious.
Chuck Haagen,

3694
02:31:41,161 --> 02:31:42,660
daas chocolate,
a Haagen Daz.

3695
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:43,710
Ooh,
la La.

3696
02:31:43,740 --> 02:31:48,690
Look at Ms Dot Nancy is
important.

3697
02:31:48,810 --> 02:31:53,220
We got along so well their whole foods.
So we started talking about an ice

3698
02:31:53,221 --> 02:31:56,460
cream.
I'm so fancy.

3699
02:31:56,461 --> 02:31:59,370
I eat Haagen,
Daz fucking supermarket in the country.

3700
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:04,760
That's your baskin robbins.
Say Chocolate guy.

3701
02:32:05,550 --> 02:32:07,300
Haagen Daz with your perrier.
Mr Rogan.

3702
02:32:08,540 --> 02:32:13,080
I enjoy it at like a sparkling water.
So it gives you a little bit of flavor,

3703
02:32:13,900 --> 02:32:16,330
but you don't like the person in juice.
Um,

3704
02:32:16,380 --> 02:32:18,480
well,
your genes are pink.

3705
02:32:18,930 --> 02:32:23,930
They're not paying salmon
pink for people who are struggling with

3706
02:32:24,181 --> 02:32:28,820
their gait thoughts.
I said salmon is the struggle and

3707
02:32:28,821 --> 02:32:29,640
realize that,
right?

3708
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:31,620
My struggle.
You go over someone's house and they

3709
02:32:31,621 --> 02:32:33,060
have salmon code sheets.
You'd be like,

3710
02:32:34,270 --> 02:32:36,330
oh,
I don't have salmon colored sheets.

3711
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:38,040
I have lavender.
I'm kidding.

3712
02:32:38,041 --> 02:32:38,880
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

3713
02:32:38,890 --> 02:32:39,950
Sad,
sad,

3714
02:32:40,170 --> 02:32:41,250
sad.
Everything black.

3715
02:32:41,251 --> 02:32:43,080
The whole house,
including the wallpaper.

3716
02:32:43,370 --> 02:32:44,880
I don't have wallpaper.
No.

3717
02:32:45,090 --> 02:32:47,280
I think wallpaper is super gay.
Wallpapers.

3718
02:32:47,281 --> 02:32:48,120
Gay.
You don't think so?

3719
02:32:48,410 --> 02:32:50,010
Um,
I've never thought about it.

3720
02:32:50,190 --> 02:32:53,610
I think the first time I've ever
entertained that thought and my years in

3721
02:32:53,611 --> 02:32:56,130
this planet,
whether or not wallpapered have anything

3722
02:32:56,131 --> 02:33:00,570
to do with your sexual proclivities,
I think it's all that designery stuff.

3723
02:33:00,690 --> 02:33:01,523
Oh,
okay.

3724
02:33:01,900 --> 02:33:03,270
Like the house,
it's over designed.

3725
02:33:03,271 --> 02:33:03,711
It's like,
well,

3726
02:33:03,711 --> 02:33:06,000
what's up with this dude?
Some people will just really into design

3727
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:07,710
like chains.
Well,

3728
02:33:07,711 --> 02:33:09,390
not anymore.
It's just so critical.

3729
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:12,450
Not other people's weird shit,
but your own weird shit.

3730
02:33:12,451 --> 02:33:15,390
You just like you see through a filter
and loving put on blast.

3731
02:33:15,420 --> 02:33:16,470
No,
it's fascinating.

3732
02:33:16,530 --> 02:33:17,730
And it'd be both.
Yes.

3733
02:33:17,940 --> 02:33:19,890
It definitely can be.
You can live your life through these

3734
02:33:19,891 --> 02:33:21,100
contradictions.
Yeah.

3735
02:33:21,210 --> 02:33:22,950
And it's,
it's a fun life to live.

3736
02:33:23,060 --> 02:33:23,910
Yeah,
sure.

3737
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:27,270
There's nothing wrong to blame me for
getting upset that no one is praising my

3738
02:33:27,360 --> 02:33:28,530
khaki pants.
Yes.

3739
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:31,230
Again,
because I see that you care.

3740
02:33:31,710 --> 02:33:35,790
Like I've never wanted someone to praise
me for a piece of clothing that I wore,

3741
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:39,000
but maybe since I was like 12 and I had
a kiss tee shirt on,

3742
02:33:39,300 --> 02:33:42,180
I searched so long for them and I got
the last pair on earth.

3743
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:44,040
Oh my God.
That's a problem in and of itself.

3744
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:47,550
They even went looking for those fucking
salmon disastrous jeans.

3745
02:33:48,500 --> 02:33:50,520
I got 29 other bears that you'd approve
of.

3746
02:33:51,450 --> 02:33:53,520
I got the stainless steel ones.
Wait,

3747
02:33:53,521 --> 02:33:53,821
wait,
wait,

3748
02:33:53,821 --> 02:33:54,420
wait,
wait.

3749
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:56,090
You have stainless steel pants?
Yeah.

3750
02:33:56,190 --> 02:33:58,230
How's that work?
It's sustaining steel.

3751
02:33:58,250 --> 02:34:00,890
A cotton weave.
Who makes sense?

3752
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:03,540
Naked and famous.
They were like 250 pairs made and I got

3753
02:34:03,541 --> 02:34:04,740
them.
What does it look like?

3754
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:06,450
It's just wrinkly.
The.

3755
02:34:06,500 --> 02:34:08,620
It's as if you're wearing wet jeans,
but they're dry.

3756
02:34:08,621 --> 02:34:11,370
That's how it feels like it's stiff,
but why do they call it stainless steel?

3757
02:34:11,371 --> 02:34:13,710
Because the weave is part 10 percent
stainless steel.

3758
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:15,630
Ninety percent cotton or the chaperone
heavy?

3759
02:34:15,720 --> 02:34:16,590
No,
they're not that heavy,

3760
02:34:16,591 --> 02:34:18,790
but they're aren't weird.
Yeah.

3761
02:34:19,150 --> 02:34:22,900
Pull those up.
Jamie stainless steel naked and famous

3762
02:34:22,901 --> 02:34:23,734
jeans.
Yeah.

3763
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:26,470
That's so odd.
This is like the opposite of barbell

3764
02:34:26,471 --> 02:34:27,160
jeans.

3765
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:28,550
Yes.
Like that.

3766
02:34:28,551 --> 02:34:30,700
You can't throw kicks in them.
That's right.

3767
02:34:30,730 --> 02:34:35,160
And it's was hard to walk in at first
because you're walking a robot

3768
02:34:37,300 --> 02:34:40,090
and I actually more than once to the
airport and I got scared.

3769
02:34:40,091 --> 02:34:40,924
I'm like,
Oh fuck.

3770
02:34:40,960 --> 02:34:41,820
Oh,
metal detector.

3771
02:34:42,210 --> 02:34:45,550
They don't detect metal anymore.
I have those to the pornography pants.

3772
02:34:45,940 --> 02:34:48,820
Pornography.
The inside cuff is a vintage

3773
02:34:48,821 --> 02:34:49,631
pornography.
Oh,

3774
02:34:49,631 --> 02:34:50,830
that's hilarious.
Yeah.

3775
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:56,100
I wonder if you can control with those.
Like it just looks like newsprint of Qa.

3776
02:34:56,290 --> 02:34:58,380
There's the stainless steel wants to the
right of the pinup.

3777
02:34:58,420 --> 02:34:59,740
Yeah,
those are stainless steel ones.

3778
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:02,350
Yeah.
So they're just heavy.

3779
02:35:02,980 --> 02:35:05,020
They're stiff.
They're not actually that heavy.

3780
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:08,230
Huh.
Interesting.

3781
02:35:08,231 --> 02:35:12,250
So like stainless steel thread.
So it's just like a novelty.

3782
02:35:12,540 --> 02:35:14,770
There is no benefit to but they just
look at the.

3783
02:35:15,070 --> 02:35:18,370
The wrinkling looks very cool.
The puckering to the fabric.

3784
02:35:18,490 --> 02:35:20,950
You're an interesting guy.
Michael is a euphemism,

3785
02:35:20,951 --> 02:35:22,200
you know,
I said that to Jamie for the show.

3786
02:35:22,210 --> 02:35:23,980
So I said something about being
interesting and that always means

3787
02:35:23,981 --> 02:35:24,730
something else.
No,

3788
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:26,560
you're an interesting guy.
You are an interesting guy.

3789
02:35:26,590 --> 02:35:29,860
Like I mean it in the most sincere way,
but that word can have many

3790
02:35:29,861 --> 02:35:31,980
connotations.
It can but not.

3791
02:35:32,020 --> 02:35:33,700
It's not how I'm reading it.
Okay.

3792
02:35:33,730 --> 02:35:35,440
Isn't that what's important?
Intent,

3793
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:36,593
right?
Yes.

3794
02:35:36,670 --> 02:35:38,260
One hundred percent intent.
Yes.

3795
02:35:38,350 --> 02:35:40,510
So we should wrap this up,
but uh,

3796
02:35:40,630 --> 02:35:43,360
I really appreciate you coming here.
I really appreciate having a

3797
02:35:43,361 --> 02:35:46,180
conversation with you and finding out
about your weird tastes,

3798
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:49,330
but you're a good dude man.
You're a funny guy and a very smart guy.

3799
02:35:49,360 --> 02:35:52,150
And your book,
dear reader is available pretty much

3800
02:35:52,151 --> 02:35:52,984
everywhere,
right?

3801
02:35:53,300 --> 02:35:54,300
Amazon,
Amazon.

3802
02:35:54,390 --> 02:35:55,780
Are Now an audio?
Yeah,

3803
02:35:55,781 --> 02:35:57,130
we just did the audio.
It was amazing.

3804
02:35:57,160 --> 02:35:58,060
Beautiful.
Did you do it?

3805
02:35:58,090 --> 02:35:59,950
No,
I got a guy in my voice is awful for it,

3806
02:35:59,951 --> 02:36:00,970
but I got it.
Great.

3807
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:04,420
But the guy who did it was like hearing
the voice of the narrator in my head and

3808
02:36:04,421 --> 02:36:06,250
I almost cried because it was like a
magical moment.

3809
02:36:06,251 --> 02:36:07,084
Yeah.
Beautiful.

3810
02:36:07,150 --> 02:36:08,920
And um,
that's it.

3811
02:36:08,921 --> 02:36:11,000
So your twitter.
Michael Mouse.

3812
02:36:11,020 --> 02:36:12,400
