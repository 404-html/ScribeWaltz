00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,040
Joe rogan experience Joe Rogan podcast.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,770
My name's

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,470
Jane Goodall.

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,540
At least 100%

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,360
I found that fascinating.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,523
And um,

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:20,271
the,

8
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:24,900
the reason being is that there's an actual
animal represents called gigantic and

9
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:29,901
it would say that's more than eight feet
tall that lived in the most recently we

10
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:34,650
know of a hundred thousand years ago.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,860
So that's not outside
the realm of possibility.

12
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:40,950
If you look at what we've learned
today about things that we thought were

13
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:41,784
extinct,

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,653
whether it's,

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:42,930
you know,

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,290
the Goblin shark or whatever
it's been looking at,

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,780
or maybe four point there because it's
still within the realm of an ape like

18
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:53,270
thing.

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,640
Yeah.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,230
Which is different from the other cryptos
all logical folks who say they were

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,153
dragging.

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,990
You get life forms that
have no counterpart.

23
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,590
Yes.

24
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,423
Anywhere else.

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,480
It's a real animal.

26
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:06,691
I mean,

27
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,820
they have home stay out of the fossils.

28
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:10,050
They know that it's real animal.

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,320
They actually found their teeth in the
apothecary shop and like a public area in

30
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,840
like the 1920s gigantic
quite make to that,

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,450
that they couldn't understand.

32
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,021
They were like,

33
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:23,250
what the fuck is this?

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,173
They knew it was probably,

35
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,140
we knew it was enormous.

36
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,750
So it eventually led to a digs in China
where they found these gigantic pivots

37
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,940
buried their dead.

38
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,670
Really fascinating stuff.

39
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:40,671
So that that's a high level of
intelligence and respect for their dead.

40
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:41,071
You know,

41
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:42,300
it's really interesting stuff.

42
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,420
And the um,

43
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,460
the Pacific northwest is a crazy spot
and it's exactly where they would come if

44
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:52,860
it came down the Bering
strait with humans.

45
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,280
It's really interesting stuff because
we know they existed with humans.

46
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,630
We know it was a real animal coexistence.

47
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,930
Yeah.

48
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,870
Would they unquestionably side by side
in Asia a hundred thousand years ago,

49
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,680
at least.

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,310
That's,

51
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,150
that's solid.

52
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,470
So it's,

53
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:09,720
that's a blip a hundred thousand years.

54
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:12,750
Especially when you look at like the
Pacific northwest and how dense it is.

55
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,051
Well,

56
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:13,884
she's saying,

57
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,680
she's saying that it
existed at some point,

58
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,550
but she's not agreeing.

59
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:17,980
You're still,

60
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,813
but randomly,

61
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,270
actually this is still there.

62
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,500
She thinks enough people have seen
the same thing when they brought

63
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,693
there.

64
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,141
First of all,

65
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:29,730
they have gray hair like silver,

66
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,243
the big old

67
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,960
six foot tall

68
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,623
gray hair.

69
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,460
They have photos of dead ones,

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,953
couple hundred shot,

71
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,721
no question.

72
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:43,554
It's a totally,

73
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,310
believe it or not,

74
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,430
this is more people go through

75
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,610
at least this particular
where they found these gems,

76
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:01,810
they have a video of one.

77
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,870
So there's an interesting

78
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,630
fundamental fact.

79
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,003
Okay,

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,240
I'm gonna make up a story.

81
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,900
There exist a creature that is large and
each every human who has come up too,

82
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,640
right?

83
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:18,990
Yeah.

84
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,540
Well,

85
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,373
how do you

86
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,470
know what I said about big foot is that
a big foot is due right next to the

87
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,460
grill is no one gives a shit.

88
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,081
And if,

89
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:31,600
uh,

90
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,400
if God didn't exist,

91
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,420
it would be mythological and
animal that is smart as a human,

92
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:42,130
maybe without three before cortex 40%
larger than a person sees people to fall

93
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:44,470
in the ocean and kill sharks.

94
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,671
Kills sharps.

95
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:47,090
Big Four.

96
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,150
Can't kill a fucking sharp know.

97
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,400
Think about the shit that killer whales.

98
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,300
Nothing pops of the killer whale except
for people because that sentence,

99
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,920
big can't kill.

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,490
I like these assertions,

101
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,860
knows the shots from the jacket.

102
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,010
It's not going to be split tasks.

103
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,390
Your arguments they have in comic con,

104
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,880
you know,

105
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,810
or Kevin Smith through.

106
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:13,110
They have a whole four hour podcasts.

107
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,810
Look when big word,

108
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,530
a Sasquatch or big foot or a sharp,

109
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,540
yeah,

110
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,840
it's the idea of the animals.

111
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:24,340
It's just like we were
talking about earlier,

112
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,390
the idea that we're,

113
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,730
that we're actually picking shit.

114
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,193
Brilliant

115
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,140
things that nobody else does.

116
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,930
Scotland.

117
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,840
Let's say I called it,

118
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,353
I told Ya

119
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,640
who was doing all your own stuff

120
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,170
or no,

121
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,730
this one is like seven years old
and this one is like that one.

122
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,873
That's cool.

123
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,610
Graphics that I drew that

124
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,510
do draw

125
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,350
the guy named Danny Williams
Tattoo that he's dead now.

126
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,650
Got Cancer.

127
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,160
The Dixon cause I want to go.

128
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,213
Not Good.

129
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,141
Wow.

130
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:19,300
That's very Japanese style off us.

131
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,740
This is not what I drew.

132
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:21,574
I drew this.

133
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,290
This is load up to massage.

134
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,360
This is Musashi versus Aaron.

135
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,250
Tell the dog what does all this
kind of Japanese like no tattoos.

136
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:33,790
You,

137
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,361
you should go full.

138
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:36,430
Yakuza bar

139
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,470
in [inaudible] will be here.

140
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:42,304
I have to call Rick.

141
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,041
Rick Ross.

142
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:43,750
Okay.

143
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,800
You're going to have her draws on it.

144
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,791
I've had no,

145
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,020
the not the wrapper.

146
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,480
Rick Ross Criminal Syndicate
boss who I went to,

147
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:56,250

148
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,023
Oh.

149
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:58,940
Oh.

150
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,773
Can we do it together?

151
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,610
What?

152
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,570
Three free smoke to off
on the down on the points.

153
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,463
Three like this.

154
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,251
There'll be a couple posts,

155
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:07,840
a message.

156
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,673
I'll get presents.

157
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,280
Okay.

158
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,590
Are you ready?

159
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,423
Ready.

160
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,293
Go.

161
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,503
Oh,

162
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,100
you broke it.

163
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,213
Panics.

164
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,393
I can't tell you that.

165
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,060
A big deal.

166
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,983
That was fine.

167
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:29,711
Oh,

168
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:30,351
that's awesome man.

169
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:32,710
I smoke like you live with us.

170
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,943
Constant.

171
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,093
Okay.

172
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,650
Pop the pop.

173
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,493
Enjoyed it.

174
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,241
I'm glad I did.

175
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:44,060
It was a lot of fun.

176
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,570
Next word.

177
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,720
Match skin.

178
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,043
What is it?

179
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,110
It's dude's would the hard
Dick's in their pants.

180
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,270
Funding their boners thinking third,

181
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,880
their underwear.

182
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,200
Why you paid money for this?

183
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,140
You really want that.

184
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,590
This is one of those things.

185
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,041
Oh,

186
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,120
well if you don't water,

187
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:07,930
I'll say I bought it for you
really drunk the next day.

188
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:08,440
I was like,

189
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,273
why did I,

190
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:16,880
okay.
