00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,650
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,180
There was a video that MTV put out.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,493
Um,

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,710
it was a new year's
resolutions for white guys.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,840
It was one of the worst fucking,

6
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:16,280
most racist sexist videos of Erythrocyte
tweet that it was so ridiculous.

7
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:20,780
Like I imagine if anybody had ever
made a video like that about any like

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,830
generalization,

9
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:24,410
about a hundred million
people and that's what it is.

10
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:25,130
It's a general,

11
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:25,963
like if you say,

12
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,190
how many white guys are in America?

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,271
Let's,

14
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:32,300
let's just guess how many
white males or an American,

15
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:33,134
not enough

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,800
princess layers.

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,830
Dot.

18
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,460
Had a heart attack right now though.

19
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,841
Okay.

20
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:40,674
How many?

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,670
62% of the population is white.

22
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,390
62% of the US.

23
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,210
What percentage of white males?

24
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,053
White males.

25
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:49,731
The majority,

26
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:51,770
which is about 77%.

27
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,900
How many white males?

28
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:54,891
Males.

29
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:57,080
The white men are 31%
of the population there.

30
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:57,770
Okay,

31
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,940
so we're 31% of the population
is 350 million people.

32
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,000
Somewhere around a hundred million people,

33
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:05,420
right?

34
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,940
It's in that neighborhood
between 80 and a hundred million.

35
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:08,774
Right.

36
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,450
That's what a crazy thing to generalize.

37
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,411
Like,

38
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:15,290
just to make a video about white men.

39
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,431
She was like,

40
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:17,630
hey white guys,

41
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,220
how about you get your shit together?

42
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:20,330
Like just white guys.

43
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,530
Just white guys.

44
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:21,950
Like,

45
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,850
Holy Shit.

46
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,010
Do you want to do this
about black guys too?

47
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,290
Why don't you see what happens
when you do it about black guys?

48
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,670
How about you do it about black women?

49
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,570
See how quick somebody
beats the fuck out of you.

50
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,220
How come you can do that
about white guys like this?

51
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:39,221
The idea is that white men are the
privileged and that white men have this

52
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:39,651
advantage.

53
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:42,530
So you should attack that advantage
by being racist towards them.

54
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,250
I the best way to stop racism is to be
racist towards people who you think are

55
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:47,084
racist.

56
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,200
It's hilarious.

57
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,240
It's so stupid.

58
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,040
It's so unbelievable that MTV news stuff,

59
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,410
they should do a video like that.

60
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:56,460
What's really bad?

61
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,720
Mtvs the worse.

62
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,500
I mean like,

63
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,240
have you watched it on TV recently?

64
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,721
I'm sorry?

65
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:00,990
Do you,

66
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,710
do you like MTV?

67
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,543
No,

68
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,670
I try,

69
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,740
I to watch TV anymore.

70
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,790
I don't have cable anymore,

71
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:06,330
so I have,

72
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:06,690
you know,

73
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,150
a ps view or whatever.

74
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,013
It's sling.

75
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,571
And,

76
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:10,020
uh,

77
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,790
so I have certain channels I normally,

78
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,530
but not as many as I used to have.

79
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:16,490
So like I'll watch MTV more
just because I have it.

80
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,120
It's one of 30 channels,

81
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,580
but MTV is just garbage channel now.

82
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,160
Like there's nothing that
we're too old for it.

83
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:27,870
That's like you have to be 18 to 22
to have any fun to have that show.

84
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,320
What does it mean?

85
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,910
Dickless is that on MTV?

86
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,720
God,

87
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,230
that shows just saw a bunch of videos for
people getting jacked on the Internet.

88
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,093
Right.

89
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,701
And then,

90
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,450
um,

91
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,230
everything else is,

92
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,430
they don't have videos anymore,

93
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,323
right?

94
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,580
No videos on youtube.

95
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:41,860
Every videos I'm sending you to one.

96
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,830
What a weird time.

97
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,201
Yeah.

98
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:44,591
But you know,

99
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:48,010
it was cool when they had videos as you
learned about new bands because you saw

100
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:48,810
their video.

101
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:48,920
Well,

102
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,030
nobody wants to watch those anymore.

103
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,610
Yeah.

104
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,100
If they,

105
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,350
yes,

106
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,840
they played videos versus
people falling on their head.

107
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,370
People go to falling on
their head every day.

108
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,470
So they just went where the money is.

109
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,760
So this is the idea is that they're
just trying to appeal to social justice

110
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,020
warriors by making this video.

111
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,270
There's one girl in the video,

112
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:07,720
she goes find out what mansplaining
is and then don't do it.

113
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,003
Oh,

114
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,121
like find out what?

115
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:15,121
Like what a ridiculous idea that you
can be condescending about someone being

116
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:20,680
condescending and it that somehow or
another is going to work like that.

117
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,930
All the thought behind
making a video like that,

118
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,790
it's exactly how Trump got elected.

119
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,530
When you tell people what to do,

120
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,780
they automatically want
to do the other thing.

121
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,960
Even if they wouldn't want to do the
other thing if you hadn't said Shit,

122
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,630
but when you push people and
you tell people just if you,

123
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:38,710
you make up ridiculous standards for
the way people are supposed to behave

124
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:41,950
because you think they should behave like
that and that you are allowed to make

125
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:46,951
gigantic gross generalizations about an
entire group of 100 million people just

126
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:51,580
because you think it's open season on
white guys like that is how people like

127
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,480
Trump get elected because people push
back against your ridiculous political

128
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:58,390
correctness and go towards
what's the enemy of that?

129
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,980
What's the enemy of political correctness?

130
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:00,910
That pussy grabbing guy,

131
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,040
let's fuck a vote modem in
and that's what happens.

132
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,600
That's exactly what happens.

133
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,250
These people are,

134
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:11,190
the people that are so mad that Trump is
in office are directly responsible for

135
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:11,290
it.

136
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,910
Hoards of people voting for Trump
because they are sick of where the the PC

137
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:17,510
generation is pointing fee.

138
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,300
It's an irrational point of view.

139
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,350
It's not objective.

140
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,920
It's not,

141
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,980
if anything has to do with
gender or homosexuality,

142
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,430
whoever has to do with any of those
things is no longer considered as an

143
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,240
individual.

144
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,930
Then you're considered as a part of an
untouchable group that is almost always

145
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:33,760
exonerated of anything
that they've done wrong.

146
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,511
It cheats.

147
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:38,440
You get to this weird fake world
where people aren't people anymore.

148
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:42,490
They're figureheads for ideologies
and that's the problem with political

149
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,001
correctness.

150
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:46,030
As much as it's a problem with people
that are super right wing or people that

151
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:47,140
are born again Christians or

152
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,700
it's fucking up comedy like so many
comedians have been talking about lately,

153
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:55,000
how like they've had to
stop themselves on stage,

154
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,050
you know,

155
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,130
and not go down a route.

156
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:00,190
They normally would always go
down because of the recent,

157
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:00,520
you know,

158
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,370
racist shit and the PC
shit sewed much different,

159
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,701
you know,

160
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:05,380
in the last even six months.

161
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,190
Well there's definitely more pushback,

162
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,560
but there's always been pushback.

163
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,880
Have you noticed a change?

164
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:10,091
Have you,

165
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:13,240
have you noticed like certain things
you won't say now or do now or,

166
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:13,651
well,

167

it makes you just back up
what you want to say better.

your arguments better.

saying.

175
