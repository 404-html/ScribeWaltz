1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,433
Now.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,540
Oh Shit.

3
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:05,440
That means we're live
ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,803
the Joe Rogan.

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:07,770
Oh,

6
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,250
I'm trying,

7
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:08,581
I had,

8
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:13,581
this is the first time ever of using this
laptop and right now it's making noise

9
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,200
and I don't know how to shut the noise
off cause I'm a simple man and the only

10
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:21,180
knows how to you use a Macintosh.

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,990
This bitch there it's
way down in the corner.

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,680
This is my first time using
windows since I was a small child.

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,520
So if you hear an echo folks,

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:36,510
all right,

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,343
that should be it.

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,361
That's it,

17
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:40,100
right?

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,933
Yeah.

19
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,010
Doesn't see me anymore.

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,900
Now this computer's trying
to give me a tutorial.

21
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,640
Just,

22
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,470
just recently started using
these alien where computers,

23
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,830
cause a Alienware is a company that
supports a lot of MMA fighters and they

24
00:00:56,261 --> 00:00:59,350
sponsor a lot of MMA fighters and
I thought it would be cool to a,

25
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,490
to use their products.

26
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,241
So,

27
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:02,074
um,

28
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:02,980
I got uh,

29
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,360
three Alienware laptops.

30
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:05,194
I got this thing was,

31
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,270
this is the [inaudible] 18,

32
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,350
I believe it's called.

33
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:09,520
This is fucking ridiculous.

34
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:10,354
This thing.

35
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,800
And in honor of our guests today,

36
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,260
Giorgio sucralose from ancient aliens.

37
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,110
Perfect God damn laptop for this show.

38
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:17,771
But,

39
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:17,891
uh,

40
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:19,840
this is the biggest laptop
I've ever seen in my life.

41
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:21,160
It's a fucking foldable Imac.

42
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:22,120
That thing is ridiculous.

43
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:22,954
He's in keyboard.

44
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,990
I love the light board is fucking deal.

45
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,190
It feels like you're using something
you're not supposed to you,

46
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,231
you know,

47
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:30,310
you're fucking around with it.

48
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,740
It's all,

49
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,990
it's like a science fiction movie.

50
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:32,824
It's sick.

51
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,670
It's really cool.

52
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,070
The,

53
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,100
the size of it is daunting,

54
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:36,934
but you know what?

55
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,230
I'm a fucking manly man.

56
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,250
I can carry a laptop.

57
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:39,731
You know what I'm saying,

58
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:40,460
son?

59
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:40,760
No,

60
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,620
I can see you Jo.

61
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,483
I don't give a fuck.

62
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,320
I don't have to see me anyway.

63
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:44,710
Um,

64
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,071
so,

65
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:45,810
uh,

66
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,110
uh,

67
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,750
our sponsors if you want.

68
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,190
Uh,

69
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,761
so anyway,

70
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:50,830
check out the Alienware laptops
cause they're pretty bad ass.

71
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:51,341
I'm like I said,

72
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:52,080
they do support,

73
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,360
uh,

74
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,200
MMA fighters.

75
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,650
So that's a while we have
decided to start using them.

76
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,341
So,

77
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:57,780
um,

78
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,010
it can make this a mutually
beneficial situation.

79
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:00,844
You know what I'm saying?

80
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,580
And I'll give you a full details on
how would I think about this thing.

81
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:03,911
My friend,

82
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:05,160
Voodoo chicken has one of these.

83
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,631
He,

84
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:05,750
uh,

85
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,461
he swears by it.

86
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:07,110
He loves that.

87
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,390
If you're going to buy a laptop
and you want it to have some balls,

88
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,920
that's definitely the way to go.

89
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,870
I mean like you're not going to
fucking go get a compact or you know,

90
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,970
is this my past top?

91
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,721
It's a desktop.

92
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:16,554
You can carry route.

93
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:16,920
Right?

94
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,480
But you fucking carried her out bitch.

95
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,881
Why?

96
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:20,160
Why do you need everything so light,

97
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,461
you know?

98
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,780
Do you know what a backpack is?

99
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,141
Yeah.

100
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,720
You throw a backpack on and then
he could take the laptop with me.

101
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,141
You Fuck?

102
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,880
Have you seen the lady at Starbucks?

103
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,751
It's usually a lady.

104
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:31,620
I've only seen it in two different ladies
who bring their whole entire tower to

105
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:32,550
the computer.

106
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,550
Like if there's this
woman that always brings,

107
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,710
she has a tower,

108
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,461
a step,

109
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:40,230
something like a 17 inch monitor.

110
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:40,831
She has,

111
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:41,070
you know,

112
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,040
her power brick.

113
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:45,840
She has a keyboard and mouse and she
sets up like her office and he just works

114
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:46,800
there for four hours.

115
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:47,281
Five hours.

116
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:47,791
That's crazy.

117
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,100
Do poor people do that
because it's the internet.

118
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,470
I think it's just because
it's not a laptop.

119
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,580
Do you get free internet?

120
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,130
Yeah,

121
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,200
and when you go to Starbucks,

122
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,730
you get free Internet.

123
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:58,440
So maybe that's why a lot
of people are working there.

124
00:02:58,441 --> 00:02:59,530
They just can't afford internet.

125
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,380
Tough Times.

126
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,030
Brian,

127
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,200
just imagine the process of
having to do this every day.

128
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,221
Well,

129
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:06,790
it's for a poor person though,

130
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,140
that can't afford the Internet.

131
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,340
It's probably a good deal.

132
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,760
What does,

133
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,900
what is good internet costs?

134
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:11,890
Like 50 bucks a month or so?

135
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,161
I don't know.

136
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:16,690
Because nowadays you can get fucking
like your DSL for like $10 a month.

137
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:16,901
Wow.

138
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:18,100
If you got to cut you back,

139
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:19,810
you've got to cut back
two times are tough.

140
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:22,030
And she's in the middle of writing
the great American supreme screenplay.

141
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:22,511
That's right.

142
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:22,630
Right.

143
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,590
The greatest movie ever.

144
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,120
It's about vampires who make
love to women and become aliens.

145
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,080
That's what it's going to be like.

146
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:29,290
Yeah.

147
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,380
We're going to have to
add aliens to the mix.

148
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,500
Our sponsors for this
fucking ridiculous show.

149
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,663
First of all,

150
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,660
the one and only of course,

151
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:38,470
the flashlight,

152
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,850
our first original sponsor,

153
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:40,810
uh,

154
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,710
we still support them.

155
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,310
God dammit.

156
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:42,641
Spite.

157
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,301
It's ridiculous.

158
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:45,870
It's like God damn solid product kits.

159
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:46,511
Shouldn't say too many.

160
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:49,390
God Damn was already pretty much
used them up for the show bananas.

161
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,070
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link for the fleshlight and enter in

162
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:54,910
the code named Rogan,

163
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:59,350
you will save yourself 15% off
the number one sex toy for men.

164
00:03:59,351 --> 00:03:59,981
And like I said,

165
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:01,840
it's a God damn solid product.

166
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,410
It's,

167
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:02,741
yeah,

168
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:03,491
it's embarrassing.

169
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:03,841
But be a,

170
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:04,674
be a man,

171
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,111
man.

172
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,220
The fuck up and go fuck one
of those things that's really,

173
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,691
really,

174
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:09,430
try it without the plastic case.

175
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,130
Once in a while it's totally different
because you getting them really squeezed.

176
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:14,170
They're rubber and have
like a really tight,

177
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,330
so you do it without the
plastic gets in a while.

178
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:17,164
It's a little different.

179
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,170
So you're basically tricking
yourself off with the snake.

180
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:20,531
Well,

181
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:21,670
it's just like grabbing your dig,

182
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:24,790
but with rubber in between it so you
don't feel your hand on your Dick.

183
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,050
So it's a little different.

184
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:26,884
Try it out.

185
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,130
It's called fish out of the
bucket and fish out of the bucket.

186
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:31,500
Fleshlight tips by red ban.

187
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,620
All right.

188
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,280
In a,

189
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,880
we are also brought to you by
[inaudible] Dot com o n n I t,

190
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:37,960
makers of Alpha brain.

191
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,270
I didn't fucking bring my house.

192
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,701
Got You.

193
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:40,620
Some Alpha brain for you.

194
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,500
Shut that shit this way.

195
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,060
Um,

196
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,530
we all,

197
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,510
we also have a,

198
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:45,820
a bunch of fitness equipment.

199
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:47,800
We just started a caring,

200
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,030
uh,

201
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,430
including the best quality
kettle bells available there.

202
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:52,990
They're these York kettle bells.

203
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,080
We're selling them as cheap as possible.

204
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,480
It's,

205
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,470
it's very,

206
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,910
it's the whole thing like
collecting this and selling,

207
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,650
selling kettle bells and shipping them.

208
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:05,140
It's a huge can't of a pain the ass.

209
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,350
You're basically sending cannon
balls through the fucking mail.

210
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:08,981
I mean,

211
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:09,940
they're ridiculous.

212
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,260
They're,

213
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,630
you know,

214
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,240
it's this cheap as we can sell them folks,

215
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:17,050
but it is the best quality
and they will last forever.

216
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,820
These things are solid iron
and it is an amazing workout.

217
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,000
It is the only workout that I do
now as far as lifting weights,

218
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,960
all I do,

219
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,010
I do kettle bells,

220
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,560
I do body weight squats and I do chin ups.

221
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,010
That's,

222
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,360
that's all I do every,

223
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:35,230
almost every exercise because I'm
interested in functional strength.

224
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,620
I'm interested in the leg strength
that I can use for Jujitsu.

225
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,440
And for me it turned out that
like when I lifted weights,

226
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,930
like doing curls and
bench press and stuff,

227
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:45,820
it's certainly helped
because I was stronger.

228
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,630
But it doesn't make you
use your body athletically,

229
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,240
use your body as one big unit.

230
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,580
And that's what kettlebells do.

231
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,870
Kettlebells are like full body exercises.

232
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,980
You're out and it's it in play in the real

233
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,251
world.

234
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:01,540
Like I bought a bag of dog
food the other day and uh,

235
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,720
it was a couple bags and they were under
a bunch of cat litter fucking things.

236
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,710
And uh,

237
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,011
you know,

238
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:09,440
you go to Petco and you've
got to like reach up and pull.

239
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:10,580
That thing is at the bottom.

240
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,960
I snatched that bitch up in the air
50 pound bag and that lady was like,

241
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:15,291
wow,

242
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,130
you're so strong.

243
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,061
And I flexed,

244
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:18,050
I don't want kettlebells.

245
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:18,884
Yo.

246
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,420
I would've said kettlebells bitch,

247
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,640
but I didn't know her that well
and I didn't want it to be all,

248
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,030
you know,

249
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,080
think I was aggressive.

250
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,340
But if you're interested in
working out and getting in shape,

251
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,450
it is the best way we dude,

252
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,740
we made them as cheapest
humanly fucking possible.

253
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,853
Um,

254
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,810
well that's my whole,

255
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,100
my whole purpose for all this stuff is
to give everybody the best shit we can

256
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:40,730
sell,

257
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,620
sell it at the lowest possible rate
with and make it as clean and as easy as

258
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:46,070
possible.

259
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,840
Like if you buy supplements from us,

260
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,800
the um,

261
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,011
the,

262
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:51,350
the big one is the cognitive
supplement Alpha brain,

263
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,080
which I 100% fucking swear by.

264
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:54,321
You know,

265
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:55,850
you can talk with Cbo all day,

266
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,480
but there's plenty of information
available online about the efficacy.

267
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,410
Make me what you use.

268
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:05,411
Big words of supplements and nutrition
as far as like enhancing your,

269
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:07,280
your brain's ability to function.

270
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:08,390
People with Alzheimer's,

271
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,010
they actually give them certain nootropics
in order to stimulate their brain and

272
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,970
they keep it functioning.

273
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,790
Our whole body relies on nutrients.

274
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,410
You need nutrients for everything,

275
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:18,921
for every,

276
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,240
every cell of your body.

277
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,470
And what these are,

278
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,270
is the best,

279
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,830
most concentrated,

280
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,380
purest form of supplements
that we can sell you.

281
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,230
And if you try this shit
and he don't like it,

282
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:32,870
you get 100% of your money back
guarantee and your first 30 pills,

283
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,460
you don't even have to return the pills.

284
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,300
I'm so concerned with making sure
that people don't feel ripped off.

285
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,340
It's impossible to make people happy.

286
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,710
There's always gonna be
someone that's a cunt.

287
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:48,010
And I try to limit the cont factor as
much as humanly possible and that way we

288
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:48,651
have it set up.

289
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,190
So anything you buy from on it,

290
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,420
whether it's a Alpha brain or
any of the other supplements,

291
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,980
first order of 30 pills,

292
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:56,450
100% money back guarantee.

293
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,500
And if you use a code name,

294
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:58,010
Rogan,

295
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,980
you saved yourself 10% of that number
one sex toy from and what here?

296
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,750
When I go into commercial boat,

297
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,490
I know what I'm doing.

298
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,560
I'm just fucking around
fucking around with toys.

299
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,050
Yes.

300
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,471
That's how I,

301
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,304
that's how I roll.

302
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,570
I'm also a,

303
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:15,170
we have these new battle ropes in
which is the latest product at on it.

304
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,380
And if you've ever seen like Brock
Lesnar workout with these giant fucking

305
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:18,880
ropes,

306
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,090
it is ridiculous.

307
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:20,930
Workout is like,

308
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,090
it's like wrestling a giant fucking snake.

309
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,220
They do this huge heavy,

310
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,850
thick ropes and you tie him to
a tree or you can actually loop,

311
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:30,470
I'm under your kettle bells if you like.

312
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:31,460
You'll go out to a park,

313
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,070
you could have a bad ass
workout just in the grass.

314
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,130
Just bring the ropes and bring the
kettle bells and there's some tutorials

315
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:38,270
online on on it.

316
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:39,170
And there's this dude,

317
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,681
uh,

318
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:42,710
shows you a bunch of different
exercises in techniques,

319
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,540
techniques you can use with the battle
ropes and they will fucking where you

320
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:46,850
are.

321
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,160
But this is all real functional strength.

322
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,701
You know,

323
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:50,151
if you,

324
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:53,300
if you want to like be able to
carry yourself over a fence,

325
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:54,680
if you want to be able
to pick something up,

326
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:57,030
you want your body to be
stronger in everyday life.

327
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,640
That's what it's all [inaudible].

328
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,950
All this shit that I'm interested in and
that's all the shit that we're going to

329
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,120
be interested in on it.

330
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,340
It's funny because at first I thought
this was this jump ropes bad know there

331
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,700
were that big cause they're here,

332
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:08,890
it looks like 40 feet long.

333
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,181
I'm like,

334
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:09,331
wow,

335
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:10,550
that's a weird way to sell.

336
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,810
Jump ropes two inches around,

337
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,000
two inches in 40 feet
long and check it out.

338
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:15,720
Watch the checkout.

339
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,171
That video,

340
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:16,531
if you like,

341
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:17,640
fast forward the video.

342
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,000
You could see like his exercises there.

343
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,810
It's fucking bad ass man.

344
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,820
What's going on here?

345
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,320
You,

346
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,300
you swing these heavy ass ropes.

347
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,700
Oh,

348
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,180
crazy.

349
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,570
Yeah.

350
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,810
And when you're doing it,

351
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,520
like go to one where you can see him
like in the middle of an exercise.

352
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:36,210
Like here's what you're swinging
these giant 40 pound ropes and dude,

353
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:38,220
you get fucking winded.

354
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,310
It's like a constant wrestling
match with an animal.

355
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:41,970
That's wild.

356
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,160
Yeah.

357
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,580
It's weird because the weight on a giant
rope when you're moving you like you've

358
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,240
got to swing it up in the air
and the weight's kind of funky.

359
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,451
You know,

360
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:48,810
it's,

361
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,190
it's all awkward and Shit.

362
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,330
Yeah.

363
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:51,931
Wobbles.

364
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:52,511
You're holding it.

365
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:52,710
You,

366
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,290
you've got to really grab it
so your grip gets amazing.

367
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,380
That's one of the things that I've
found since I started using kettlebells.

368
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,920
My grip for Jujitsu is way better
than it's ever been before.

369
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,750
Just just kettlebells and Chin ups.

370
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,370
And another thing we're
going to get into soon,

371
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,420
it's club bells,

372
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,360
club bells or another amazing exercise.

373
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,171
Not that kind of bells,

374
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:10,680
Brian.

375
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:10,921
They're,

376
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:13,820
they're an an ancient Indian form of a,

377
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,730
of working out.

378
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,070
Do I use a 15 pound one?

379
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,460
It's,

380
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,890
that's how hard these extras are.

381
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,730
It's a 15 pound club bell,

382
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,541
15 pounds.

383
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,321
I'm a manly man.

384
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:22,710
Brian.

385
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,500
It's hard for me to admit that
15 pounds is actually a workout,

386
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,240
but that's how bad ass these ours,

387
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,980
these exercises are.

388
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,581
There's a,

389
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:30,240
um,

390
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,780
the 35 pound kettle bell workout
that will kick your fucking ass.

391
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:34,620
And I know you like,

392
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,200
I can't work out with a 35 pound weight.

393
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:38,910
What kind of a girly man am I?

394
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,140
But I'm telling you this as a kettlebell
extreme cardio workout and you can get

395
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:43,970
the video from,

396
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:44,130
uh,

397
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,750
the company's called dragon door.

398
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,231
See,

399
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:47,790
I'm not even doing my commercials.

400
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,140
I'm hooking people up for free.

401
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,063
Okay?

402
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,470
I'm not even affiliated
with these bitches,

403
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,460
you know.

404
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:53,671
Uh,

405
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:55,380
but they have two of them.

406
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:55,930
He's a,

407
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,160
he's done two of these workouts
and they're fucking incredible.

408
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:02,610
They kick your ass and all you need is
one kettle bell and we're eventually

409
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:06,300
going to have a bunch of different
videos that are going to be available for

410
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:08,250
download on on at.com as well.

411
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,580
We're going to produce them some workouts
for people so that you can just press

412
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:13,190
play and follow along through that.

413
00:11:13,191 --> 00:11:14,040
That's what I like to do.

414
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:18,240
That's why I like that extreme kettlebell
cardio workout because you just press

415
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:20,100
play and he works out
with you and you just,

416
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,740
you just follow what
he does and it's Bruno.

417
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,830
He doesn't have to be in your
house and creeping you out.

418
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,760
It doesn't have to be weird looking at
your dog and should get becoming friends

419
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:29,330
with your wife,

420
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,530
giving you kissy faces,

421
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,120
send a text message to your kids.

422
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,871
I like white wine.

423
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:36,170
Cold thing to note is that the prices
are insane on the kettle bells because I

424
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:40,100
was just at target looking at just us
single kettlebell and you have like this

425
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:42,680
thing called the starter pack that
comes with three kettle bells.

426
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,000
It governs with a a I believe a 35 uh,

427
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,360
or a 25 if fifth in two
fifteens or something like that.

428
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,380
I don't even know what it is.

429
00:11:51,381 --> 00:11:53,980
But you can pull these
different combinations.

430
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,221
Yeah,

431
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:54,450
there's,

432
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,170
there's quite a few
different combinations.

433
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,880
There's so it's like it's set up for
someone who's like a serious athlete to

434
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:01,990
someone who is just,

435
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,853
you know,

436
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,910
a small girl who wants to learn
some strength and it's one of the,

437
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:07,571
for women too,

438
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:08,381
it's not just for men.

439
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:09,101
It's fucking amazing.

440
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:11,560
It just things like Turkish
getups I'm telling you,

441
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:14,770
it doesn't seem like you think like
to work out you have to do like,

442
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,590
you know like bench press
or you have to do curls or,

443
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:21,580
but the reality is something called
the Turkish getup where you just,

444
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,200
you have this little weight,

445
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,840
you put it in your hand and
you just practice getting up,

446
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,840
just getting up in a controlled way
and extending your arm up in the air.

447
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:29,290
It's all,

448
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,490
you can watch videos of it.

449
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:33,340
There's a hundred different videos
explaining how to do it online,

450
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:36,820
but it's an amazing workout and
it's great for core strength,

451
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,930
functional strength,

452
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:42,160
strength that you would actually use in
real life if you had a choke a bitch.

453
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,230
It's good idea that the
package it like that.

454
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,220
That was cheaper than a
single tea kettle bell.

455
00:12:46,221 --> 00:12:46,920
Dot Target.

456
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,800
I see like that one.

457
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:48,634
The beast.

458
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,960
That's a perfect machine.

459
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:50,771
Yeah,

460
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:51,231
the machine.

461
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:51,320
Yeah.

462
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,531
Yeah.

463
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:52,364
Powerful,

464
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,061
powerful.

465
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:56,894
Bert Kreischer.

466
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,600
Um,

467
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:57,871
yeah.

468
00:12:57,871 --> 00:12:59,910
There's a bunch of different
names for the different ones,

469
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:00,391
the beast,

470
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:00,931
the machine,

471
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:01,740
the starter,

472
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,240
but go check it out on it.com.

473
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,410
O.

474
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:04,410
N.

475
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:04,410
N.

476
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:04,410
I.

477
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,430
T use the code name and save yourself
some money on some supplements.

478
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:09,420
You dirty bitches.

479
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,770
Go get your brain right,

480
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:11,604
son.

481
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,391
All right.

482
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,830
That's it for this.

483
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,610
We will move on now to
the actual real podcast.

484
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,533
Holy Shit.

485
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,160
George Ohsu closest here,

486
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,781
trying my day.

487
00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:25,930
Joe Rogan podcast,

488
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,783
my

489
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,450
Paula,

490
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,560
Giorgio,

491
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,393
my man.

492
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,310
We actually do have alien and

493
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:39,330
where computers in respect for you,

494
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,351
they're pretty dope,

495
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:40,591
right?

496
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:41,340
Great.

497
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,450
The whole alien community must be
like really excited about your show.

498
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:47,010
Like people that sell alien ship.

499
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,320
Yeah.

500
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,020
Because if you're a fan
of like ancient aliens,

501
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:51,600
you want to just go out and like
buy as much alien shit as possible.

502
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,690
I was just in Roswell for the
very first time in my life.

503
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,020
Let's get you closer to the microphone
if we can get it right in front of your

504
00:13:58,021 --> 00:13:58,770
face.

505
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,603
Yeah,

506
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,100
yeah,

507
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,450
yeah.

508
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:00,991
Wonderful.

509
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:01,824
Everybody can hear me.

510
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,580
Testing.

511
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,180
Testing.

512
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,420
Yeah.

513
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,100
Perfect.

514
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,440
Well I was just in Roswell
for the first time,

515
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,700
my life and that's impossible.

516
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,650
I thought you'd been there
a hundred times already.

517
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,850
No snooping around.

518
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,660
I haven't.

519
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,260
What's going on?

520
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,400
He tell people who don't know.

521
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:14,630
Uh,

522
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:14,820
what,

523
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,530
what the reason for what Roswell,

524
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:16,720
there's,

525
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,910
there's a few people out there don't
understand the story well in Roswell

526
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:25,070
allegedly there was a Ufo crash or some
type of a crash in 1946 1947 and the

527
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,240
next day when the newspaper
reported something,

528
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,300
they said that a flying saucer,

529
00:14:33,301 --> 00:14:37,620
a flying disc had crashed
there with the potential of,

530
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,160
you know,

531
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,300
one living body.

532
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,630
Out of the three and a three days later
there was a retraction of that story

533
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,120
where the government then
told the Roswell newspaper,

534
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:52,130
there you have to print a
story that flying saucer

535
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,480
crashed but a weather balloon and it
was the only military testing that's the

536
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:56,810
bay,

537
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,970
basically the Roswell Story.

538
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,361
And,

539
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:04,310
and ever since Roswell happened
over the next 10 15 years,

540
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,700
our technological development in
on earth basically snowballed.

541
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,400
There was a company called
the American computer company.

542
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,300
Do you remember them?

543
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,760
It was a American computer company,

544
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:17,840
US computer company,

545
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,050
but it was run by some people who were
claiming to have some sort of technology

546
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,240
and some sort of an infer
information about the,

547
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:30,770
the progress of technology as it pertains
to the government back engineering

548
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:32,540
alien spacecrafts on Roswell.

549
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:32,930
Sure.

550
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,030
I have not heard from that company.

551
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,410
It was a long time ago.

552
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,611
Art Bell Days,

553
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:39,920
I think he was like a sponsor
art bell show or something.

554
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,510
I mean even even the idea of IBM,

555
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,300
there are ideas that the IBM was funded
after they exchanged of some type of

556
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:54,861
information between the government and
a themselves after the Roswell crash and

557
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,840
in some exchange of knowledge.

558
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,820
And then ever since then,

559
00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:00,031
you know,

560
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:04,050
IBM I think is the first company that
came out with a computer chip and things

561
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:04,884
like this.

562
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:09,060
So the question that Phillip Corso
asked himself in his book that they,

563
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:10,020
after Roswell,

564
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:10,854
he said,

565
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,740
where did IBM get this technology from?

566
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:18,670
Because they basically sprung up out
of nowhere and then they have this,

567
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,533
this chip.

568
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,220
So what does work though?

569
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,750
Someone like had an invention.

570
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:22,991
I mean,

571
00:16:22,991 --> 00:16:23,291
wouldn't,

572
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,640
that isn't how things happen.

573
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,840
Like someone had felt some course,

574
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,880
but it do just spring out of nowhere.

575
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,743
It was discussed

576
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,960
and he had basically sprung
out of nowhere and you know,

577
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,850
core so had actually worked
in the government and so
he had all these redacted

578
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:40,870
documents that he was able to read when
they were unredacted and things like

579
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:41,680
that.

580
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,221
And uh,

581
00:16:42,221 --> 00:16:45,760
so he made a point that
he thinks that our,

582
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,803
you know,

583
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,100
very quick industrial revolution and
everything else too until you know,

584
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:54,820
putting a man on the moon and now we're
in the international space station and

585
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:56,440
things like this that,

586
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:56,740
you know,

587
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,970
is this acceleration of technology
must have had some type of an

588
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:02,410
extraterrestrial origin.

589
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,310
And he placed it on,

590
00:17:05,311 --> 00:17:07,780
on Roswell in 1946 47.

591
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,610
That sounds ridiculous.

592
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,430
But if,

593
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,460
but if it was true,

594
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:13,330
what a fucking,

595
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,060
what a mind fuck that they
found a crash sauce and what,

596
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:17,320
how fuck are they doing this?

597
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,610
And they backed the whole thing up.

598
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,280
I have that Roswell,

599
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:22,120
a newspaper clipping on my wall.

600
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:25,180
I have a print of it framed on my wall.

601
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,900
It's a,

602
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,100
it's crazy to look at.

603
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,000
It's crazy to look at.

604
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:28,930
But you know,

605
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:29,161
you,

606
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:29,410
you,

607
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,980
you stop and think if it was
some sort of government craft,

608
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:35,830
how many people would have been in
the know and if it was some sort of,

609
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:36,130
uh,

610
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:36,341
you know,

611
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:39,400
they know the Nazis back then
had some Ufo looking devices,

612
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:39,611
you know,

613
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:41,050
they had some flying discs.

614
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,380
Sure.

615
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,213
Which is a,

616
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,950
makes you wonder like what came
first the chicken or the egg,

617
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:45,883
right.

618
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,070
Did they see some shit and try to like,

619
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:48,881
it was like Whoa,

620
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,160
how fuck did they do in that?

621
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,930
We've got to figure out
how to make one of those.

622
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,350
Right,

623
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:52,841
exactly.

624
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:53,674
You know,

625
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,420
I mean why,

626
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,620
why make a disk?

627
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:55,891
Why,

628
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:56,461
what are you doing?

629
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:57,750
Where are you getting that idea from?

630
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,251
Why is it a disc?

631
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:01,200
Is the disc supposed to
come from a mothership?

632
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,490
Do they have theories on that?

633
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,170
To be honest with you personally,

634
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:09,171
I have no idea because I really am not
into modern a UFO stories and stuff like

635
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:10,080
this.

636
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,560
However I've been told
and due to the shape,

637
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:16,620
cause apparently these things
they spin and they spin.

638
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:19,140
They create some type of a
vortex or an energy field,

639
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,580
and that's how they're able to travel.

640
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,920
So I guess that's the
best shape for again,

641
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:24,810
sounds completely ridiculous.

642
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,590
And let us,

643
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,890
you stop and think about like how about
these cave paintings that they recently

644
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:29,820
found that,

645
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:29,980
uh,

646
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,190
turn out to be a lot
older than they thought.

647
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,380
And our result is 40,000 years ago,

648
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,160
which is making people think that
it perhaps in the enter talls even,

649
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,820
uh,

650
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,050
we're doing cave art.

651
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,660
It wasn't just a homosapien
and not only that,

652
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:47,460
but what many people don't realize
is that neanderthal and Homo sapiens

653
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,863
coexisted.

654
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,060
Yes.

655
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,310
And then in a bread bowl
essentially then died out.

656
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:53,910
But yes,

657
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,743
absolutely.

658
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,920
And a lot of [inaudible] and that
was something that five years ago was

659
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:00,060
completely anathema.

660
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,170
Nobody talked about it.

661
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:02,580
And then the research came out at,

662
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:03,391
hold on a second,

663
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:05,610
we found these new fossils and man,

664
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,570
they coexisted.

665
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:09,800
So why did Neanderthal
Diet over homosapiens?

666
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,120
Because neanderthal was stronger,

667
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,560
had bigger brains,

668
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,720
a bigger bone structure.

669
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:20,930
So if the whole survival of the
fittest evolution theory were true,

670
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,060
then logically you would have to say
that neanderthal should've won out over

671
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:30,210
homosapiens cause we're puny
compared to home with SAPE.

672
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:30,661
Well they were,

673
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:31,351
there were short,

674
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:33,440
but they were really like stalky and wide.

675
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,110
Yes.

676
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,943
Elsewhere.

677
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,180
But there's stupid as fuck.

678
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:37,050
So we ganged him.

679
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,913
That's how it works.

680
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,960
But that's the big question.

681
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,730
Allegedly,

682
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,341
not allegedly,

683
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:43,050
but they had bigger brains.

684
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:43,411
Right.

685
00:19:43,411 --> 00:19:44,310
So does an elephant.

686
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,730
Yeah.

687
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,031
Yeah.

688
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:46,410
But it's the size of the body.

689
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:48,990
They were like five foot three
and they were over 200 pounds.

690
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:52,410
They had like really thick bones and they
would probably be beat the shit out of

691
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:52,950
us.

692
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,920
They were collect closer
to chimps than than we are,

693
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,993
which is why I'm,

694
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,740
I always say I'm mostly Niana tall.

695
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,843
Probably.

696
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,620
If I had to go back and
look at my gene pool,

697
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:03,670
I'm sure someone got fucked by a cave man.

698
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,530
You would.

699
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:04,980
Yeah.

700
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,720
My point was if you,

701
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:07,140
um,

702
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,910
if you look at that cave art from 40,000
years ago and look at anything that we

703
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:12,744
do today,

704
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,310
it would seem completely impossible.

705
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:19,140
And 40,000 years in the span of
the universe is literally nothing,

706
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:19,650
a blip.

707
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,550
Not even nothing.

708
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:21,000
Not even,

709
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,601
you can't,

710
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:23,070
you can't even wrap your head around it.

711
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:28,071
So whenever I talk to someone who's
skeptical about aliens or time travel or

712
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:29,424
anything,

713
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,211
and I was like,

714
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:30,630
bitch,

715
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,540
you are using magic right now.

716
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:33,961
You're,

717
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:35,460
you're on a phone,

718
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,540
you're talking to someone,

719
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:41,490
nowhere near you with a device that you
can also talk to and get fucking answers

720
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,230
from about virtually anything.

721
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,340
You talk to it.

722
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,510
You ask it,

723
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,190
you know who created the Sistine Chapel?

724
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,120
Who did the painting,

725
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:49,630
you know,

726
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:49,871
Oh,

727
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:50,840
it wasn't me,

728
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,150
Michael and Oh we,

729
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:52,781
in order to Vinci,

730
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:54,100
which one of those motherfuckers was it?

731
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,160
Did they find out instantly
on your goddamn phone?

732
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,260
Some shit that happened
thousands of years ago.

733
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,840
So for us to even like,

734
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,550
well of course it's possible.

735
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,800
Something could have an energy vortex.

736
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,653
There you go.

737
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,890
Siri's talking to you.

738
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,760
You could have something some day that
travels by virtue of some sort of anti

739
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:18,700
gravitational field or some new type of,

740
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,180
you know,

741
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,720
uh,

742
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,400
some sort of a harnessing of anti matter.

743
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:22,661
I mean,

744
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:26,980
there's so many possibilities as you
look at energy sources and then you,

745
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,930
you sort of have to extrapolate how far
we've come in such a blip of time and

746
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:33,850
then think of a thousand years,

747
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,590
think of a million years,

748
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:36,191
a million years.

749
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:37,630
Ain't shit for the universe.

750
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,160
A million years is nothing.

751
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:39,701
I mean,

752
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:42,400
there's certain stars that
have lives that are much,

753
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,540
much longer than ours.

754
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,320
Like our star is only going to
last for like a few billion years,

755
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:47,740
right?

756
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,130
Yes.

757
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,030
And then it'd be done,

758
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,480
done.

759
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,590
And then everything on this planet,

760
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:51,520
it's going to be done too.

761
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,820
But they're stars that been fine forever.

762
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,301
You know,

763
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:59,740
there's stars that lasts much longer and
they live in solar systems that don't

764
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:01,630
have er asteroids in them.

765
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:02,770
That's possible too.

766
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,480
It's every solar system doesn't have some
fucking gigantic asteroid belt like we

767
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:07,960
did right.

768
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,580
Between Mars and Jupiter,

769
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,290
there's hundreds of thousands of these
near Earth objects that could just fuck

770
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,340
everything up.

771
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,450
All they have to do is come flying in and
it could happen any second if and when

772
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:21,460
people don't know is Jupiter saves us.

773
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,050
If it wasn't for Jupiter,

774
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,500
there was no way we'd be this
stable Jupiter and our moon.

775
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,180
Those two things are critical.

776
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,840
Our Moon to keep our,

777
00:22:29,841 --> 00:22:30,081
our,

778
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:33,840
our orbit very stable
and very similar like it,

779
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:35,380
it doesn't vary too much.

780
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,990
And the Jupiter is the,

781
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,950
like the magnet for all
the asteroids and the,

782
00:22:40,951 --> 00:22:45,070
this amateur astronomers who have
caught like recent asteroid impacts.

783
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:45,761
It was Jupiter,

784
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:46,331
Saturn,

785
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:47,380
I can't remember which one it was.

786
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,520
Pretty sure it was Jupiter.

787
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,301
But yeah,

788
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:49,781
it was Jupiter.

789
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:51,480
It was a big fucking impact.

790
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:53,080
And this amateur astronomer caught it.

791
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,220
So their shit how fair this shit out
there that comes fucking flying down.

792
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,430
If we lived in a place that
didn't have that shit out there.

793
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,930
So if there was a water base planet like
ours and some place that didn't have

794
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:05,920
the same issues,

795
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:06,760
they could,

796
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,860
they could exist a million
years longer than us.

797
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,950
Wrap your head around
that because they want it.

798
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,780
They wouldn't be extinct at some point.

799
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,760
What us some sort of an impact.

800
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:15,851
Well,

801
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:16,391
not only that,

802
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:17,380
we're late to the game.

803
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,060
This planet is late to the game.

804
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:23,320
This player zone four billionaires have
4.6 billion years old or something like

805
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:23,890
that.

806
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,270
People don't understand the universe.

807
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,470
That ain't shit just for what
their current understanding
of the universe is is

808
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:32,770
somewhere around 14 plus
billion light years old.

809
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,270
God Damn Man,

810
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:35,860
4 billion years and ain't shit.

811
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,723
That's nothing.

812
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,390
Then you got to wrap your fucking head
around the fact that a human being is

813
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:44,680
actually constructed out of star dust
that are the molecules and the the,

814
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:44,881
the,

815
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:45,080
the,

816
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,510
the this,

817
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,980
the actual

818
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,980
ingredients for us literally have to
be made inside stars and then that star

819
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:55,980
blows up and then somehow or
another it becomes a person.

820
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,110
No,

821
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,240
we are all inside.

822
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:03,590
If you take a piece of skin and you
look at it underneath the electron

823
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:04,424
microscope,

824
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,241
you see it.

825
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:06,490
Everything wobbles at the,

826
00:24:06,491 --> 00:24:07,940
the deeper you go into decor,

827
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,080
everything vibrates.

828
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,310
It's all about harmonics.

829
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,290
Now we just looked at a piece of skin.

830
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,220
If you take a piece of stone
and you go at the same core,

831
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,260
you see the exact same thing.

832
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:20,450
You cannot distinguish between the two.

833
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,470
And that to me is absolutely fascinating
because it means there really is no

834
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:29,120
difference between material that's
considered organic and inorganic.

835
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,920
One is alive and one is dead,

836
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,270
but is it really dead?

837
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:37,330
It's not because we all consist of the
same stuff or as a you said of star stuff

838
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:38,901
and that was,

839
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:39,171
you know,

840
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:44,171
an idea that a calls Sagan
brought forth and you know what,

841
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,330
what better brain than him to to you know,

842
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,180
introduce these ideas because it's crazy.

843
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,010
The across Eggo is an amazing guy.

844
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,830
He actually wrote that movie contact
for the folks who don't even know,

845
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:57,230
which I saw recently and still holds up,

846
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,390
still holds.

847
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,170
It's an amazing solid moving.

848
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,450
We we that alone,

849
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,313
just that.

850
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:03,811
Just the,

851
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:04,101
the,

852
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:05,090
just getting to let,

853
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:07,310
just the idea of subatomic particles,

854
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,920
just the idea of cells
and atoms and molecules,

855
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,150
just the idea of that is way
crazier than the idea of aliens.

856
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:14,481
Sure.

857
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:14,961
And you know,

858
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:16,760
what's fascinating to me also is that,

859
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:17,720
you know,

860
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,720
talking about aliens or other solar
systems or actually other galaxies out

861
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:23,804
there,

862
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,320
uh,

863
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,090
astronomers today have sore or,

864
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:26,900
uh,

865
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,490
yeah,

866
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,190
astronomers have,

867
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,190
have suggested that there are more
galaxies in the entire universe than there

868
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:38,090
are grains of sand on all
the beaches in the world.

869
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,010
Now

870
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,010
think about that for just,

871
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:42,640
that's,

872
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,473
you know,

873
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,740
that's insane.

874
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,570
We're so nothing,

875
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,300
and we're so everything and,

876
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,240
and galaxies.

877
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:52,360
And each galaxy has billions of,

878
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,500
of solar systems,

879
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,573
each galaxy,

880
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,450
and there's more galaxies than sand,

881
00:25:57,451 --> 00:25:58,450
the grains of sand.

882
00:25:58,451 --> 00:26:03,070
And then ultimately the ultimate mind
fuck is that they now believe that inside

883
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:04,870
every black holes and other universe,

884
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,570
that a black hole is
literally a dimensional door.

885
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,710
Something will you,

886
00:26:08,711 --> 00:26:09,790
if you pass through that,

887
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:13,840
you will literally go into
a new fucking universe.

888
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,210
No,

889
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,310
there's hundreds of billions of them
because each solar system at the center of

890
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,470
every galaxy is a supermassive black hole.

891
00:26:20,471 --> 00:26:24,040
That's exactly one half of
1% of the entire mass of
the galaxy is something they

892
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,890
figured out and the early two
thousands they didn't know.

893
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:27,810
I mean they didn't know that.

894
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:28,820
They kind of,

895
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,100
there was a bunch of people that knew
that that black holes were around,

896
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:33,611
but the,

897
00:26:33,611 --> 00:26:38,080
to know that they're in the center of
every single galaxy and that is directly

898
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:39,760
proportionate to the size of the galaxy,

899
00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:40,130
the mass,

900
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:40,963
the black hole,

901
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,160
and the latest idea being that if you went

902
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,090
through that black hole,

903
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:48,360
that that black hole literally would bring
you into another universe that may or

904
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,950
may not be anything like this.

905
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,350
It may be exactly.

906
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,160
It may be that what we're seeing is just
like some sort of an operating system

907
00:26:56,161 --> 00:27:01,161
that runs over reality and that we're
not just existing in even one universe.

908
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:03,210
As a person like Lena,

909
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,680
when I say that you can change your life.

910
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,570
If you change your direction,

911
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:07,890
you can change your life.

912
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:08,400
You can,

913
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,010
maybe you actually can for real.

914
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,230
Maybe every time you make a decision,

915
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,230
every second of every day a new
universe has created with a different,

916
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,610
a different set of probabilities
and possibilities and it
all operates inside of

917
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:23,160
the operating system that
you've chosen to accept.

918
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:23,701
You know,

919
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:26,070
Western civilization America,

920
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,880
2012 Giorgio sucralose
with his crazy hair,

921
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,360
Joe Rogan with no hair on computers talk.

922
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,171
I mean what I'm saying like,

923
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:39,171
but what you actually are might be
this like piece of the universe that's

924
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:46,761
expressing itself through different forms
over and over again throughout time.

925
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:47,701
Like you're,

926
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:48,001
you,

927
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:52,590
you are this eternal thing that's a part
of this massive thing that's too big

928
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:53,970
for you to possibly understand.

929
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,220
So your child,

930
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,620
your job is just to try
to go along in this,

931
00:27:58,621 --> 00:27:59,041
this,

932
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,930
this path you're doing and create energy.

933
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,440
See if you could figure out what's the,

934
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,070
what's the best way to
get the good feelings?

935
00:28:05,071 --> 00:28:06,660
What's the best way to have the best time?

936
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:08,040
What's the best way to spread the,

937
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,760
but what you're doing is you're like a
harvester of energy and that it's just

938
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:15,510
done through this body in this life
and that it's going on everywhere,

939
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:16,380
all around you,

940
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:16,951
all the time.

941
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:18,450
And you literally are the universe.

942
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,050
Right?

943
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,780
And then after having said all of this,

944
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,640
which was absolutely beautiful,

945
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,820
there's still people
out there who will say,

946
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,620
we are alone in the universe.

947
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,910
Those people are silly bitches.

948
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,440
That's desk that the Ed to say,

949
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:32,041
you know,

950
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:34,710
it's like people who say that
Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,

951
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:35,311
shut up,

952
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:35,870
bitch.

953
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,490
There's plenty of information that
shows us something was going on.

954
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:43,140
There's a massive amount of fuckery
afoot for you to say in 2012 that you are

955
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:46,320
sure because I've looked at the
information and I just don't see it.

956
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,193
Why don't you're an idiot?

957
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,450
Well,

958
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,920
you're not telling the truth or you have
decided that you don't want the world

959
00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:54,930
to be as complicated
as it really truly is.

960
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,240
And so you're
compartmentalizing no people.

961
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:57,811
Exactly.

962
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:02,811
People always have to be ready to
accept certain realities they want.

963
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,860
They want laws and rules.

964
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,450
And a lot of water or not ready.

965
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:06,900
Yeah,

966
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,450
that's it.

967
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,180
That's it.

968
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,720
That's the real thought about aliens.

969
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:12,120
And that's the one thing when
I think if I was the president,

970
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:12,721
what would I do?

971
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:16,580
I would definitely not tell people the
same mother fuckers that are watching Kim

972
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,070
Kardashian now.

973
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,650
Now I'm not telling you if I
knew that there were aliens,

974
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:22,350
if I knew that there
was hanger f 18 out in,

975
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,200
where was it?

976
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,940
Ohio,

977
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,420
right?

978
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,610
Isn't that where they Wright
Patterson air force base.

979
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,650
They flew the wreckage of,

980
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:29,370
that's the other thing.

981
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:32,460
If you want to think that it was
just a a just a weather balloon.

982
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,690
They flew the fucking wreckage in two
separate planes and Eisenhower met them

983
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,410
there.

984
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,300
They flew it to Wright
Patterson air force base.

985
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,010
And the reason they flew
it in two separate plans
because they didn't want the

986
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,500
plane to crash and then
lose all the information.

987
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,050
So they,

988
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:45,401
they put,

989
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:49,640
they separated it into two planes
just to make sure that they got some,

990
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,830
some of it got there,

991
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:51,940
dude.

992
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,190
They were so worried about plane crashes.

993
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:59,191
They sent two planes and that was
what that Jesse Marcel guy had said,

994
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:00,000
right.

995
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,940
Or W who is the,

996
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:01,090
uh,

997
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:01,300
the,

998
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,270
the rancher was the ranchers
name that discovered it.

999
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,920
To be honest with you.

1000
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:07,240
I don't you don't remember the names.

1001
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:07,780
No,

1002
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,021
it's a,

1003
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:09,820
it's a really fascinating story folks,

1004
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,230
because the people that were there have
like all these crazy stories of what

1005
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:14,801
went down.

1006
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:18,820
Some people saw bodies and there was
one guy who was a local corner and they

1007
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:20,800
asked him to actually make some,

1008
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,310
um,

1009
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,160
some coffin,

1010
00:30:22,161 --> 00:30:22,994
some small,

1011
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,310
three foot long coffins.

1012
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:26,680
And he thought there was
some dead children and they,

1013
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:26,801
uh,

1014
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:27,351
they brought him,

1015
00:30:27,351 --> 00:30:27,850
they wanted,

1016
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,061
he will,

1017
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:28,361
you know,

1018
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:28,551
they,

1019
00:30:28,551 --> 00:30:32,080
they have these things there and they
were rotten and stinking supposedly,

1020
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,521
but me,

1021
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:35,200
it sounds ridiculous,

1022
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,000
but so do we.

1023
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,431
We sound,

1024
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:39,430
we're just the fact that we're
doing this fucking podcast,

1025
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,660
this is ridiculous.

1026
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,620
We're sitting here,

1027
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:45,100
we're talking and somehow or another are
talking gets broken down in a ones and

1028
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:47,080
Zeros and sent through the air.

1029
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,700
I'm not even connecting anything.

1030
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,080
This fucking thing is wireless.

1031
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,040
It is magic.

1032
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,150
It's nuts.

1033
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,590
It's craziness.

1034
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,710
Just that is absolute fucking craziness
and right now thousands of people are

1035
00:30:58,861 --> 00:31:01,300
listening and by the time they sent the
whole thing is over be somewhere around

1036
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:05,170
a half a million people have been
contacted by these words coming out of our

1037
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:05,440
mouth.

1038
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,550
That's nuts.

1039
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,970
It totally is because you know if you
look at the the the status coincides and

1040
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:12,901
all of this,

1041
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:14,230
you know everybody's about physics,

1042
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:14,560
this,

1043
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,930
physics that but if you think about it,

1044
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,910
physics and Newtonian physics that we
apply to our physical world right here do

1045
00:31:21,911 --> 00:31:26,110
not apply on a subatomic level
which is quantum physics.

1046
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,440
Newtonian laws of physics do not
apply at all in quantum physics.

1047
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,590
What you're saying is well for folks who
don't know there was a finance said it

1048
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:35,951
best.

1049
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:37,570
If you think you
understand quantum physics,

1050
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:39,330
you don't understand
quantum physics exact cause.

1051
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,390
Nobody understands it.

1052
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:42,670
Well I shouldn't say nobody
understands it cause there are,

1053
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:45,520
there are certain things that we have
figured out and discovered an under

1054
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:50,740
certain things that we know but there's
some madness in re like what has been

1055
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:51,580
proven.

1056
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,091
It's in,

1057
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:53,050
it's all mathematically,

1058
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:54,700
which makes no sense to
me because I'm an idiot.

1059
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,721
It comes to math.

1060
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:57,490
I am literally a monkey.

1061
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,450
Same here man.

1062
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,410
But what they have figured out is that
there are particles that can exist in a

1063
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:06,340
super position where they were
moving and still at the same time.

1064
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,050
And then things blink
in and out of existence.

1065
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,820
Like they literally aren't there anymore.

1066
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,990
And then they come back,

1067
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:19,020
they go away and then they come back
nature of reality or you have one particle

1068
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:24,310
and you've got a cardboard thing with
two holes and before you know it,

1069
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:29,670
you look away and to particle finds itself
on the other side of those two holes

1070
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,310
really,

1071
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,990
or one hole or two particles go through.

1072
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,551
I mean it's,

1073
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:32,971
it's,

1074
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:33,431
it's this,

1075
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:33,780
uh,

1076
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,090
you know,

1077
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,150
someone actually explained to
me that whole thing about the,

1078
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:37,750
um,

1079
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,250
the results changing
once you measure them,

1080
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,230
that the observer changes the results.

1081
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,010
Exactly.

1082
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,160
But what do you mean sent it out?

1083
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:44,960
This is WIC,

1084
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,130
that friend in the movie or a documentary
called what the bleep do we know?

1085
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:49,930
See,

1086
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,320
I,

1087
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,640
I've,

1088
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,970
I put that up online.

1089
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,700
I'm glad we had this discussion because
there's a lot of fuckery when it comes

1090
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:56,330
to that.

1091
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:01,130
That was all a created by the
same people who did the secret.

1092
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,110
And it's like those,

1093
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:04,610
it's that lady who's like,

1094
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:05,180
uh,

1095
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:05,630
you know,

1096
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,201
I'm talking too much.

1097
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:09,170
She's like some sort
of cult type lady ramp,

1098
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,030
you know,

1099
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,461
talking about,

1100
00:33:10,461 --> 00:33:10,720
okay,

1101
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,450
yes,

1102
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,500
what the bleep do we know?

1103
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:14,720
And through the rabbit
hole and all that stuff,

1104
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,270
there's,

1105
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,030
there's some fuckery
to what they're saying.

1106
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:17,570
And here's,

1107
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,770
here's one of the parts of it.

1108
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,090
It's not that the results change
is because someone's looking at it.

1109
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,040
It's because you're measuring it.

1110
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,670
And so they've decided to
make something really woo woo,

1111
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,590
which is quantum physics is crazy.

1112
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,180
Woowoo enough as it is.

1113
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,920
They tried to add some sort of a mystical
spiritual element to it that secure

1114
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,710
controlling it with your mind.

1115
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,480
I'm doctor Quantom.

1116
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,200
Um,

1117
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,531
you know,

1118
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:44,000
I don't think that's correct.

1119
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:45,230
According to My friend Wick,

1120
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,460
Aka j d,

1121
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,150
um,

1122
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,571
he,

1123
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:48,404
um,

1124
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,820
he said that it is all which totally
makes sense and that this is something

1125
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:55,640
that's really frustrating
to actual real physicists.

1126
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,331
That these,

1127
00:33:56,331 --> 00:33:57,950
these sort of ridiculous,

1128
00:33:57,951 --> 00:33:58,280
uh,

1129
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,380
interpretations of physics that are,

1130
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:00,830
uh,

1131
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,840
expressed really inaccurately,

1132
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:06,250
almost on purpose to make
people think that there's,

1133
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:06,850
you know,

1134
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,390
that the secret is real.

1135
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,051
The secret,

1136
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:09,680
by the way,

1137
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,970
may be real if you're a winner and
if you succeed then the secret trail,

1138
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:14,900
but guess what?

1139
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,900
You get hit in the head by a fucking
media or you didn't ask for that bitch.

1140
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,321
Okay?

1141
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:20,510
You're not really controlling
the whole ball of wax.

1142
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:21,620
That's ridiculous.

1143
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,730
You can't really create,

1144
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:25,130
reality is some randomness is experience.

1145
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,070
You can certainly affect certain things.

1146
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,980
You can certainly with
positive energy affect your,

1147
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:32,420
your immediate environment,

1148
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:32,691
you know,

1149
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:35,750
by creating good feelings amongst
friends and things like that.

1150
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:37,340
But you got controlling asteroids,

1151
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,174
bitch,

1152
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,660
you know,

1153
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,950
they're coming and they killed the
dinosaurs 65 million years ago.

1154
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,813
Maybe,

1155
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,661
maybe,

1156
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:49,100
and they might've killed people
off a 12 point 9,000 years ago.

1157
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:49,963
Have you heard this?

1158
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,660
This is a,

1159
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,700
some of the latest data that's coming out.

1160
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:56,810
And I felt like a bad mother fucker cause
I sent this to John Anthony West and

1161
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:59,030
he had not heard it yet and I was like,

1162
00:34:59,170 --> 00:34:59,991
yeah bitch,

1163
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:01,790
I am your portal to new information.

1164
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:02,810
I got it through Twitter,

1165
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,720
some tweets,

1166
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,990
which is the coolest shit about Twitter.

1167
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:06,411
You know,

1168
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:08,180
someone will send you
like cool shit that you,

1169
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,450
I mean I find out more cool shit
through Twitter than anything.

1170
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:13,100
Now Twitter and my message board,

1171
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:13,934
those are the two things,

1172
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,871
but 12,000,

1173
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:15,740
900 years ago,

1174
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,040
they know that there was some massive
meteor impacts all over the planet.

1175
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,710
They've confirmed it now by the,

1176
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,160
um,

1177
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,993
the um,

1178
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:23,843
uh,

1179
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,840
different parts of the
world have this sort of,

1180
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,170
uh,

1181
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,440
glass that's created from
incredible heat and impacts.

1182
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,250
Yup.

1183
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,010
They have some from the
atomic energy sites,

1184
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,281
you know,

1185
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:34,491
where,

1186
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:36,740
where we tested nuclear
explosions and created it.

1187
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,050
Well,

1188
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,980
they've also found this

1189
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,430
stuff and it's all at 12,900 years old.

1190
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,140
When they do like core
samples and the date,

1191
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,741
the date,

1192
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,520
the time of it,

1193
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,960
it's all to 12,900 which is really
fascinating because that's when all the

1194
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:53,610
people that believe that there was some
ancient civilization that was far more

1195
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,470
advanced than we give them credit,

1196
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:57,410
like ancient Sumeria,

1197
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,860
Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt.

1198
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,740
The idea is that 12,900 years ago,

1199
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:08,040
there was probably already
a hugely advanced culture.

1200
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:13,130
Like we just assume that this tiny amount
of space between 12,900 years ago and

1201
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:14,160
today,

1202
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,410
which is in the galaxy is again,

1203
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,273
it's nothing.

1204
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,140
We may have had to start
over 12,900 years ago.

1205
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:27,141
We may have been bombarded by giant pieces
of rock from the sky that killed off

1206
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:32,460
a huge amount of people and we had to
start from scratch literally as hunter and

1207
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:32,971
gatherers.

1208
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:36,240
We literally had to do it like
a fucking Kevin Costner movie.

1209
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,710
Like we're like the post man.

1210
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,570
I mean that's really possible that at
one point in time there were some really

1211
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:44,790
incredibly sophisticated societies.

1212
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,670
And one of the things that's evidence
is some shit that you brought me right

1213
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:48,150
here.

1214
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,800
The Age Blah from Puma poon coup.

1215
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,820
He brought me a replica of a,

1216
00:36:51,821 --> 00:36:54,660
a real stone that exists.

1217
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,210
You want a mind fuck
on a much larger scale.

1218
00:36:57,211 --> 00:36:57,870
Of course,

1219
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,440
that's just,

1220
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:58,921
Oh of course.

1221
00:36:58,921 --> 00:36:59,041
Yeah,

1222
00:36:59,041 --> 00:36:59,874
this is fine.

1223
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,680
But it's,

1224
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,660
but it's incredible just to look
at it as a tiny thing to thank.

1225
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:05,430
If an ancient civilization created this,

1226
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:09,810
like what kind of amazing machinery did
they have to cut out these right angles?

1227
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:13,410
Cause this really is representative
of the actual stone structure.

1228
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,960
You want a mind fuck folks go.

1229
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:16,380
Um,

1230
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,550
there's video on demand.

1231
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,770
If you have that shit and
you can get ancient aliens,

1232
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,610
watch them.

1233
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,960
The most recent one,

1234
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:25,080
the Puma punk who one
episode in season four?

1235
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,071
Yes.

1236
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:27,450
The mysterious city of Puma,

1237
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,580
Puma [inaudible] mind.

1238
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:30,000
Fuck that places.

1239
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,050
It really is because I think that,

1240
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,760
what's the altitude 12 almost 12,800 feet.

1241
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,800
So that is,

1242
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,251
you know,

1243
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:38,361
an,

1244
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:42,030
an altitude altitude where the
air is already very rarefied.

1245
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,050
Um,

1246
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:43,261
you know,

1247
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:47,610
you get tired real quick when you run
around up there and you have this giant

1248
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:51,900
field of ruins with these
giant stone platforms that way,

1249
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,210
or they start at like 80 tons,

1250
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:56,580
these platforms and you know,

1251
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,890
when archeologist or when
you ask archeologists,

1252
00:37:58,891 --> 00:38:01,410
how did they move these
giant stone platforms,

1253
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,401
they'll say,

1254
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:02,641
oh,

1255
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:03,211
no problem.

1256
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:04,410
They used wooden rollers.

1257
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,090
And of course the entire world goes,

1258
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:06,810
okay,

1259
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,700
plausible idea,

1260
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,790
plausible explanation.

1261
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:09,901
And,

1262
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:10,410
uh,

1263
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,450
the truth of the matter is that a 12,000,

1264
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:13,284
800 feet,

1265
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,540
you're above the natural tree line.

1266
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,930
So no trees ever grew at that altitude.

1267
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,300
And so if you then propose,

1268
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:21,571
all right,

1269
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:23,130
so they went to a lower altitude,

1270
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:27,540
got all the logs up there and
use it then for wooden rollers,

1271
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,290
if you only put a two ton block
on top of a wooden roller,

1272
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,240
the roller breaks.

1273
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,440
So,

1274
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:34,681
you know,

1275
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:36,250
the whole idea of wooden rollers

1276
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,083
and you know,

1277
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:37,900
stuff like that,

1278
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,720
it's just the rollers to go for 20 tons.

1279
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:43,000
What is the biggest block at Puma Puma?

1280
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,063
Uh,

1281
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,570
one stands at 125 tons.

1282
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,270
And just for reference,

1283
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,373
fucking Christ

1284
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,770
one ton is 2000,

1285
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:54,790
200 pounds.

1286
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,230
So you do the math.

1287
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,150
I can't do the math that hurts my head.

1288
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,400
Exactly.

1289
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,610
A hundred tons.

1290
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,970
And that's not even in,

1291
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,813
you know,

1292
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:03,920
in,

1293
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,290
in Baalbek Lebanon,

1294
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:07,180
we have a stone that's 1000,

1295
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,800
250 tons.

1296
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,300
What else?

1297
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:10,691
Fuck.

1298
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:12,760
Heliopolis and it's not on the floor.

1299
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:14,620
It's on actually the third level of,

1300
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:14,880
uh,

1301
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,181
of,

1302
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:15,400
of,

1303
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,780
of stone stone rose.

1304
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:17,681
Uh,

1305
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:18,370
and so,

1306
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,203
you know,

1307
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,320
and we're being told that our ancestors
did this allegedly with chicken bones

1308
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:24,220
and with dental floss.

1309
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:28,820
So know I do agree with,

1310
00:39:28,821 --> 00:39:29,080
with,

1311
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,070
with two ideas.

1312
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,890
Either it had to have to
do with extra terrestrials,

1313
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,350
not that the extra terrestrials
themselves build it,

1314
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,600
but that our ancestors had help from them.

1315
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,780
That's the big differentiation
between the theory of the idea.

1316
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,350
So even if they had a
super advanced civil war,

1317
00:39:43,351 --> 00:39:44,680
he was a super civilization.

1318
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:45,400
Exactly that.

1319
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,220
Then somehow by media rights
or whatever got wiped out.

1320
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:50,680
So what we need to wrap
our heads around those.

1321
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:53,170
If it was a super advanced civilization,

1322
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,690
it was really more advanced than us.

1323
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:56,560
Oh sure.

1324
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,710
When you look at their actual construction
methods and what they could do when

1325
00:39:59,711 --> 00:39:59,920
you know,

1326
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,391
you look at that,

1327
00:40:00,391 --> 00:40:02,170
just just what we know,

1328
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,540
they have dated very accurately,

1329
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,870
the construction of the
Pyramids to 2,500 BC.

1330
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,730
There are really positive about that.

1331
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:10,520
It's,

1332
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:10,910
you know,

1333
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,090
taken all these different samples
from different parts of it.

1334
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,740
So just back then,

1335
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,783
just back then,

1336
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,220
2,500 fucking years ago,

1337
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,840
something existed,

1338
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:24,250
some sort of technology that allowed
these motherfuckers to calculate so

1339
00:40:24,251 --> 00:40:24,971
perfectly,

1340
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:26,140
they could put 2 million,

1341
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:27,880
300,000 stones,

1342
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,950
all of them coming to a point,

1343
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,640
the covered and smooth lines to
what the fuck were they using?

1344
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:34,610
Right.

1345
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,310
What the fuck are these guys using?

1346
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,240
We don't have a clue.

1347
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,770
We literally don't have a clue.

1348
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,030
So for us to wrap our heads
around the idea of like,

1349
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:44,350
well that's preposterous.

1350
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:47,590
Why would you think that aliens
had something to do with it?

1351
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,430
Because even if they were an advanced
civilization that were wiped out,

1352
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:53,800
they were way more advanced than us.

1353
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,330
Like freaky shit.

1354
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:55,960
Right,

1355
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,531
exactly.

1356
00:40:56,531 --> 00:40:56,741
And I,

1357
00:40:56,741 --> 00:40:57,880
and I truly think that,

1358
00:40:57,881 --> 00:40:58,241
you know,

1359
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:00,820
especially when you look at
some of the ancient texts,

1360
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:01,301
you know,

1361
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:05,680
cause a lot of times the ancient
alien theory is attacked for being,

1362
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,530
you know,

1363
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:06,850
uh,

1364
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,550
one way of undermining human ingenuity.

1365
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,820
And in a way I understand the,

1366
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:13,211
the,

1367
00:41:13,211 --> 00:41:13,510
the,

1368
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,380
the upset.

1369
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:15,460
But at the same time,

1370
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,200
what I always say is,

1371
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,063
look,

1372
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:23,370
if we were to subscribe to the ideas
that our ancestors wrote on paper or you

1373
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:25,411
know,

1374
00:41:25,411 --> 00:41:27,940
I had in their oral
traditions or whatever else,

1375
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,690
then they themselves actually
said that they did have help.

1376
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,800
And for us to say today

1377
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,761
they did that,

1378
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:39,380
they did it all themselves because
they even said that they had help.

1379
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:40,430
You know,

1380
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,450
who's really insulting
whom here because you know,

1381
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,750
they're saying the gods came from the
sky and they all speak of things like the

1382
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:52,751
Nephilim or the Anakie and it's
always someone came from the sky.

1383
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,900
But it could have been so bad.

1384
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:56,360
Motherfuckers that lived in the
other part of the world that had,

1385
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,170
they had spaceships are ready and they
were flying around earth and space ships.

1386
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:00,710
Could that,

1387
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:00,951
you know,

1388
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:01,761
is that possible?

1389
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:04,400
Like like make a an airplane,

1390
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,430
not a spaceship and an airplane
that looks like a flying saucer.

1391
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,300
Could we do that today?

1392
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,150
Probably red bull people
have seem to do it.

1393
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:14,450
Or maybe just like some super advanced
dudes would come down and maybe you know

1394
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,320
there was like one of those things
where people go to the Amazon,

1395
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:17,511
I go,

1396
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:18,710
this is a TV,

1397
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,060
you know like cause that,

1398
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:23,630
because that happens today that go to
the Amazon and they'll still apparently

1399
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:28,250
according to Sam Sheridan did he say they
still have uncontacted tribes when he

1400
00:42:28,251 --> 00:42:28,470
was,

1401
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,480
he had spent some time in the
ambulance and he said there was few.

1402
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,720
So I don't,

1403
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,220
I don't know if they were 100% sure about
that because I had recently read about

1404
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,140
one that they contacted that was a hoax.

1405
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,911
There has to be done.

1406
00:42:39,911 --> 00:42:40,271
I mean it's,

1407
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:40,671
it's a big,

1408
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:44,850
those pictures that came out about three
years ago where the helicopter window

1409
00:42:44,851 --> 00:42:46,900
with the tribe and they
tried to hit hit the,

1410
00:42:46,901 --> 00:42:48,200
the helicopter was spears.

1411
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:48,460
Yeah.

1412
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,293
They were always all,

1413
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,500
it was all pretty considerate.

1414
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,590
Painted red.

1415
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,310
Yeah.

1416
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,143
They look dope.

1417
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,200
It was your volume.

1418
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:54,920
But I mean,

1419
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,920
but this whole idea you see is based on
what ethnology is referred to as a cargo

1420
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:00,854
cult,

1421
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,790
where if a technologically primitive
society gets in contact with a

1422
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,830
technologically advanced society,

1423
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,930
that technologically Primitive Society
perceives that technologically advanced

1424
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:13,910
society as being God's,

1425
00:43:13,911 --> 00:43:14,744
God's,

1426
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,860
which they're not.

1427
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:18,650
I mean they're only from
a perception standpoint,

1428
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:19,430
gods,

1429
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,980
but not really from an actual stance.

1430
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,751
So real mind,

1431
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:28,751
fuck is that gigantic Mayan statue
that's carved of a dude in a spaceship.

1432
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,330
I mean this month is slab.

1433
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,270
If you haven't seen
this in [inaudible] Bay,

1434
00:43:35,271 --> 00:43:36,770
there's this huge,

1435
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:39,330
I guess what would you call it?

1436
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:39,920
Mural?

1437
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,151
It's,

1438
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:40,560
no,

1439
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:40,820
it's,

1440
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,050
it's a sarcophagus list.

1441
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,321
Yeah.

1442
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:42,930
It's a lid.

1443
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:43,400
A Lid.

1444
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:43,911
Exactly.

1445
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:46,930
But it's all carved in one
giant piece of stone apps.

1446
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:47,360
Yes.

1447
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:47,841
And it,

1448
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:52,700
the image is a man who is in a like
an astronaut seat before you continue

1449
00:43:52,701 --> 00:43:53,510
through every bus.

1450
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,840
Anybody can go online and
just type in Palenque k slap,

1451
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:57,171
p.

1452
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:59,480
A.

1453
00:43:59,480 --> 00:43:59,480
L.

1454
00:43:59,480 --> 00:43:59,480
E.

1455
00:43:59,480 --> 00:43:59,480
N.

1456
00:43:59,480 --> 00:43:59,480
Q.

1457
00:43:59,480 --> 00:43:59,480
U.

1458
00:43:59,480 --> 00:43:59,481
E.

1459
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:00,740
So while we talk about it,

1460
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,940
you should check it out because you're,

1461
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,610
you're looking in my opinion at a,

1462
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:05,331
at some type of,

1463
00:44:05,331 --> 00:44:05,840
of uh,

1464
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,830
an aerial vehicle.

1465
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:07,041
Yeah.

1466
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:07,731
The guy is,

1467
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:09,410
he's working pedals folks.

1468
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,040
He's got it,

1469
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,280
he's got a shift lever or something
and it looks like he's looking through

1470
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:14,114
optics.

1471
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,661
It's like,

1472
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:17,180
or he has some type of a
breathing thing attached to his,

1473
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:18,500
knows something's going on,

1474
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,850
something's going on.

1475
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:25,270
And he is reclined like in the same
position like modern day astronauts when

1476
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,860
they launch into space.

1477
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,210
Yeah,

1478
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:30,110
there reclined and uh,

1479
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,060
he's wearing some really
bizarre clothes and

1480
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,230
on the outside you see this,

1481
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:35,750
he sits insight.

1482
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,410
This contraption that looks like almost
like a bell shape and the at the bottom

1483
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,244
of it,

1484
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,830
if you look closely on one end,

1485
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:45,510
at the bottom of this machine,

1486
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,840
there is as if there's a carving that
looks like and then exhaust flame or

1487
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:52,260
something like this.

1488
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:56,870
And it's fascinating and archeologists
are interpreting this as um,

1489
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:57,480
you know,

1490
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,040
king precall on his journey to the
underworld and things like this.

1491
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,680
And Linda Sheely right before she died,

1492
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,820
she did,

1493
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,653
uh,

1494
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,220
she translated the glyphs,

1495
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:10,530
the band of glyphs that's around the slab,

1496
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,340
uh,

1497
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,810
in the sixties and seventies.

1498
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:17,130
She translated as king per
Carl's journey to the underworld.

1499
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:21,690
And you can see how is swallowed up by
the underground monster and things like

1500
00:45:21,691 --> 00:45:22,500
this.

1501
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,990
But before Linda died,

1502
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,630
she said that I would like to change my
opinion about one translation I made and

1503
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:32,070
she made a few changes,

1504
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:34,050
but one that she was
very particular about,

1505
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,710
she said that she made a mistake by
suggesting that this was king per Kyle's

1506
00:45:38,711 --> 00:45:42,900
journey into the underworld because
she said that the word she baba,

1507
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,130
which is underworld,

1508
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,660
can have two meanings.

1509
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,400
And the second meeting she said,

1510
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:51,840
which he is more convinced
about is the word Milky Way.

1511
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,290
So what we have five George.

1512
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:00,140
And so what we have here is a depiction
of King [inaudible] journey to the Milky

1513
00:46:01,321 --> 00:46:02,090
Way.

1514
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:03,240
How amazing is that?

1515
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:04,074
So,

1516
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:04,621
you know,

1517
00:46:04,621 --> 00:46:08,010
in one way the ancient alien
theory has set this all along.

1518
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:11,460
That what we're looking at
here is some type of a vehicle,

1519
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,210
uh,

1520
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,600
some shuttle craft with which to
go to the mothership or whatever,

1521
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,960
or an actual spaceship.

1522
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:18,550
Who knows,

1523
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:18,800
right?

1524
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,210
Because one thing I would
like to make very clear,

1525
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,970
none of these things
that we look at today,

1526
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,290
the pyramids,

1527
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,150
uh,

1528
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:26,440
the,

1529
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:26,710
the,

1530
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,860
the [inaudible] that
we're looking at here,

1531
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:31,170
none of the ancient archeological sites,

1532
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,550
none of that stuff.

1533
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,330
Please.

1534
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,400
None of it was built by aliens.

1535
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:37,170
It was all built by human beings.

1536
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:38,850
There's absolutely no question in my mind.

1537
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,130
But as the ancient,

1538
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:41,520
uh,

1539
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,910
our ancestors said it was all built,

1540
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,870
most of it,

1541
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:50,760
the great majority was built
with the help of the gods.

1542
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,740
There in lies the difference.

1543
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,820
I have never said,

1544
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:54,360
you know,

1545
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,193
that hey,

1546
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:55,551
they,

1547
00:46:55,551 --> 00:46:56,760
aliens built the pyramids.

1548
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,130
It's total nonsense to
suggest such a thing.

1549
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,810
Of course he was humans who did it,

1550
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:06,020
but they themselves said that we've had
help and he was this magical stuff that

1551
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:12,060
they gave us with which we were able
to move to stones and things like that.

1552
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:12,520
So,

1553
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:12,750
and,

1554
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,040
and we're looking at it from
a modern day perspective and,

1555
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:15,840
and see,

1556
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,380
you know,

1557
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,870
what were they really trying to tell us?

1558
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,320
It's a real good point that you
made about people saying that,

1559
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:22,740
you know,

1560
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,190
you don't give enough credit
to human ingenuity and that,

1561
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:27,024
you know,

1562
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,650
to really give credit to these people,

1563
00:47:28,651 --> 00:47:30,040
you have to listen to
what the fuck they said.

1564
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:30,641
Exactly.

1565
00:47:30,641 --> 00:47:32,710
And if there's a lot
of photos or excuse me,

1566
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:32,891
uh,

1567
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:37,891
paintings from ancient times that show
and like classic ancient paintings that

1568
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:42,520
show people in what looks like
a flying fucking spaceship.

1569
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,533
Absolutely.

1570
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:44,441
And you know,

1571
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:46,270
to me the whole thing is,

1572
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:48,880
is absolutely it's,

1573
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:49,420
it's,

1574
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,170
it's almost,

1575
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:50,381
I mean,

1576
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:50,981
not almost,

1577
00:47:50,981 --> 00:47:55,981
but it is insulting because we have to
remind ourselves that when writing was

1578
00:47:57,221 --> 00:47:59,350
invented for the very first time,

1579
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,640
imagine for yourself,

1580
00:48:00,641 --> 00:48:00,851
Joe,

1581
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:02,320
for a moment in all of our listeners,

1582
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:04,900
imagine if you've never,

1583
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:05,531
if,

1584
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:08,320
if you've lived now 30 years of your life,

1585
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,470
but in all those 30 years
he didn't know how to write.

1586
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,410
And then all of a sudden
overnight you learn how to write.

1587
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,450
What's the first thing
you're going to write down?

1588
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,460
You're going to write down your name,

1589
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:19,990
you're gonna write down your wife's name,

1590
00:48:19,991 --> 00:48:22,060
you're gonna write down your
kid's name when they were born,

1591
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:22,894
this and that.

1592
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:27,460
And then after that you will tell other
things that happen to you that were

1593
00:48:27,461 --> 00:48:28,360
significant.

1594
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,900
So you're not going to lie in
your first ever recording of,

1595
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:34,780
uh,

1596
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:34,991
you know,

1597
00:48:34,991 --> 00:48:35,850
knowing how to write.

1598
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:36,700
It's possible.

1599
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:39,190
But it's also possible that people
have always been full of shit.

1600
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:40,990
And as soon as they figured
out how to talk to figure,

1601
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:41,291
you know what,

1602
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,820
I don't have to tell the
truth and get in trouble.

1603
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:43,140
Why?

1604
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,200
Just make some shit up.

1605
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,640
Dot is that is correct.

1606
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:46,040
But as,

1607
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,840
and I'm sorry,

1608
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,130
I'm hearing some weird like crackling.

1609
00:48:49,131 --> 00:48:50,230
Do you think that's my headset?

1610
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,850
It's like it's not connected,

1611
00:48:51,851 --> 00:48:52,061
right?

1612
00:48:52,061 --> 00:48:52,481
Or something.

1613
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:53,500
It feels like maybe I,

1614
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,513
maybe it's off.

1615
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:55,503
Is it connected right?

1616
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:56,620
No.

1617
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,240
Now it's kind of like some crazy noise.

1618
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,770
It's got a yes.

1619
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:00,131
Yeah.

1620
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:02,950
Let me see if maybe it's
not connected over here.

1621
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:03,690
I'm sorry.

1622
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,940
What were you in the middle of saying?

1623
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:06,791
Oh No,

1624
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:07,240
that,

1625
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:07,541
you know,

1626
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:12,541
writing at at the back in the day was a
new invention and so I disagreed at our

1627
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:19,180
ancestors that all they did
was sit around a campfire,

1628
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:23,710
smoking dope and getting drunk and coming
up with fantasy stories because every

1629
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:28,711
psychologist and psychiatrist will tell
you that no idea can come about without

1630
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:32,350
a spark of inspiration and you know,

1631
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:34,150
you doing your acts and stuff,

1632
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:34,481
you know,

1633
00:49:34,481 --> 00:49:37,510
you're always inspired by stuff
that's happening in your life.

1634
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,370
If nothing would have
happened in your life,

1635
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:40,810
where would you get your material from?

1636
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:43,540
Material from if you
were to live in a vacuum.

1637
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,840
So that's what they're suggesting
is that these ancient stories,

1638
00:49:46,841 --> 00:49:49,990
especially the further we go back in time,

1639
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:55,290
that the likelihood of them being
nonsense or figments of our ancestors

1640
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,260
imagination are very,

1641
00:49:59,261 --> 00:50:00,310
very slim.

1642
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:05,050
That they actually saw something that's
so far superseded their technological

1643
00:50:05,051 --> 00:50:06,010
frame of reference,

1644
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,520
that they tried to describe stuff,

1645
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,340
what they saw with the words they knew,

1646
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:17,410
they didn't have the vocabulary to
describe an actual spaceship with.

1647
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:18,120
It's uh,

1648
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:18,521
you know,

1649
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:19,400
airlines and,

1650
00:50:19,401 --> 00:50:21,250
and whatever those names are.

1651
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:22,570
And Airlines.

1652
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,110
Well,

1653
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,100
the um,

1654
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,001
how do you call the,

1655
00:50:25,001 --> 00:50:25,834
uh,

1656
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,093
it's on the back,

1657
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,180
a w of the wing of planes.

1658
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,670
Ailerons Stanson ailerons day.

1659
00:50:31,671 --> 00:50:33,320
They make the plane go up and down.

1660
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:37,490
They don't have the specific
jargon for these specific things.

1661
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,000
So then they look at that stuff
and because the Aileron is moving,

1662
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:41,990
they think,

1663
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:42,651
holy crap,

1664
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:43,880
that thing must be alive.

1665
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:47,750
And then they turned this whole thing
into a bird or something like this.

1666
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,870
And so all of a sudden we have birds.

1667
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:55,880
Made of metal in ancient texts that make
a lot of noise when they fly around.

1668
00:50:55,881 --> 00:51:00,140
But what's a one of my favorite
passages from the Bible?

1669
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:00,921
One of my favorite,

1670
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:04,390
what the fuck pastures is the
whole depiction by Ezekiel?

1671
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:04,940
Yes.

1672
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,350
Of the wheel within a wheel.

1673
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:09,810
This fly he's talking about
like what is the actual dino,

1674
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:12,320
do you know the actual quote cause oh no,

1675
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:12,501
no,

1676
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:13,880
it's not an actual quote.

1677
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,830
It's actual quote from the
box versus upon versus it's a,

1678
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:19,081
it,

1679
00:51:19,081 --> 00:51:21,520
it goes on and entirely through the,

1680
00:51:21,521 --> 00:51:21,940
there's the,

1681
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,890
there's two books to
the book of [inaudible],

1682
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,160
first part and the second part.

1683
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,970
And in the first part is he killed,

1684
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:30,110
describes this thing that he sees,

1685
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,640
not while he's asleep,

1686
00:51:31,641 --> 00:51:33,020
but while he's actually awake.

1687
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,110
And,

1688
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:34,320
uh,

1689
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,650
it descends in front of men.

1690
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,850
He refers to it as the glory of the Lord.

1691
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,350
And he says that,

1692
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:39,921
you know,

1693
00:51:39,921 --> 00:51:40,790
as it approached,

1694
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:45,790
it was as if he was hearing a thousand
waterfalls and the earth shook and the

1695
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,520
wind and sand came into the air and the,

1696
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,420
there was an earthquake and just,

1697
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:50,811
you know,

1698
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:55,550
he was trembling and he fell to the
ground in awe because he was being visited

1699
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:57,290
by quote unquote God.

1700
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,730
And um,

1701
00:51:59,360 --> 00:51:59,840
you know,

1702
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,460
it basically,

1703
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:01,731
you know,

1704
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:02,190
my,

1705
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,230
the question then is,

1706
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,910
since when would god need a vehicle
to get from point a to point B?

1707
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:10,760
And of course this is straight
out of star trek five,

1708
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,110
the unknown country.

1709
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:12,831
You know,

1710
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:14,570
where the idea was,

1711
00:52:14,571 --> 00:52:16,330
why would god ever need a via Colby?

1712
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,420
God can create things,

1713
00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:19,550
but he actually still has to walk around.

1714
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,033
You know,

1715
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,910
maybe he's like totally bad ass,

1716
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,661
but you know,

1717
00:52:23,661 --> 00:52:24,920
he can't like fly or anything.

1718
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:25,640
Exactly.

1719
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,690
Needs to make a spaceship.

1720
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,590
Now what's really cool about the
whole is equal story is that this NASA

1721
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,460
scientist by the name of Joseph Bloom,

1722
00:52:32,461 --> 00:52:32,780
Rick,

1723
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,770
he wrote a book called a space,

1724
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:38,720
a space ships of Ezekiel in
which there's NASA scientists.

1725
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:39,920
This rocket scientist,

1726
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,160
he looks at the biblical passages in
the book of Ezekiel and he went to the

1727
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:50,210
drawing board and he actually
created this upside down cone shaped,

1728
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,790
you have pho type flying saucer.

1729
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,160
But how can he do that
from those depictions?

1730
00:52:55,161 --> 00:52:56,840
Cause if depictions are so cryptic,

1731
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:57,741
well of course,

1732
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:58,790
and that is why,

1733
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,420
you know,

1734
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:04,230
he actually approached this whole
idea trying to debunk Eric fun.

1735
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:05,063
Danny can,

1736
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:05,511
uh,

1737
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:08,540
at a lecture that Eric gave in Huntsville,

1738
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:10,550
Alabama at the NASA,

1739
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,410
the NASA headquarters expert explained
people who don't know Eric von Danna,

1740
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:15,651
Ken,

1741
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,560
he's came up with that,

1742
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,060
the book and the movie
chariots of the Gods.

1743
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,060
And that was in the 1970s.

1744
00:53:23,061 --> 00:53:23,421
And,

1745
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:23,690
uh,

1746
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:24,290
uh,

1747
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:24,810
you know,

1748
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:29,810
viewers off the ancient alien theory
recognize Eric with the gray hair and the

1749
00:53:30,451 --> 00:53:31,021
blue suit.

1750
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:32,060
That's Eric [inaudible].

1751
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:37,070
And he basically launched the whole
ancient alien craze in the 70s.

1752
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:38,701
And,

1753
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:39,300
um,

1754
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:39,900
you know,

1755
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,150
there was a bit of a lull,

1756
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:42,870
sort of the 80s into the 90s,

1757
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,260
and we own a business and
now it's booming kids.

1758
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,061
Well,

1759
00:53:47,061 --> 00:53:47,311
you know,

1760
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:48,450
but it's just fascinating that,

1761
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:48,960
you know,

1762
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,700
he is still around and he has just
completed writing book number 34.

1763
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,481
Oh my God.

1764
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,470
Chariots of the gods.

1765
00:53:55,471 --> 00:53:56,400
So you know,

1766
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,331
anybody who says,

1767
00:53:57,331 --> 00:53:57,870
you know,

1768
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:58,890
is he still around?

1769
00:53:58,891 --> 00:53:59,670
He's still alive.

1770
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,371
Of course he is.

1771
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:01,170
And he's a pro.

1772
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,940
He's more prolific than ever before.

1773
00:54:02,941 --> 00:54:04,590
I mean writing 35 books.

1774
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:07,080
What is the latest [inaudible]
roller skates of the wizards?

1775
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:07,531
How many,

1776
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:11,910
how many books can you write about the
same subject lamps up to God or whatever.

1777
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:12,631
You know.

1778
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:13,140
So,

1779
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:13,650
you know,

1780
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,360
to me it's just fascinating that,

1781
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:15,840
you know,

1782
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:20,370
this proves that this is not just
something that he thinks I can just sell a

1783
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:20,971
couple of books,

1784
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:22,560
but he genuinely believes this stuff.

1785
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,390
Otherwise he wouldn't,

1786
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:27,370
I don't think you know that
you would still do this after

1787
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,031
44.

1788
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:28,370
What have,

1789
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:32,200
you would certainly do it if it was
part of your culture and you know,

1790
00:54:32,201 --> 00:54:33,130
as part of your,

1791
00:54:33,131 --> 00:54:33,310
uh,

1792
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:34,390
your social circle,

1793
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:35,700
but you know,

1794
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:37,311
he lives in,

1795
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,350
you might not believe it.

1796
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,380
He lives in Switzerland.

1797
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,230
They're very anti Ufo over there.

1798
00:54:41,231 --> 00:54:43,600
So I believe he believes it.

1799
00:54:43,601 --> 00:54:45,640
I mean I'm not necessarily
sure that he's right,

1800
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:48,730
but I believe that he believes
it when I watch it though,

1801
00:54:48,731 --> 00:54:51,070
it's an amazing documentary
still to this day.

1802
00:54:51,071 --> 00:54:51,904
It's incredible.

1803
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,910
What's incredible about chariots of the
gods is the shit that you cannot fuck

1804
00:54:54,911 --> 00:54:55,480
with.

1805
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,480
I got in an argument when I first came
to California and not an argument,

1806
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:01,330
I was dressed down by
a reporter character.

1807
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:02,440
We were talking about,

1808
00:55:02,441 --> 00:55:02,740
uh,

1809
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,161
you know,

1810
00:55:03,161 --> 00:55:05,170
a Ufo and somehow or another he asked me,

1811
00:55:05,171 --> 00:55:06,100
do you believe in Ufos?

1812
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,270
And I always pretty much have said
the same thing when I was younger.

1813
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:11,740
I wanted to believe them for sure.

1814
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,570
I said most likely they probably exist,

1815
00:55:13,571 --> 00:55:14,160
but who knows.

1816
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:14,340
My,

1817
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,910
my thing has always been who knows?

1818
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:16,780
And uh,

1819
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,081
he said,

1820
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:17,980
well what evidence,

1821
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,340
what evidence have you ever seen that
makes you think that it's possible?

1822
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:21,881
And I said,

1823
00:55:21,881 --> 00:55:22,001
well,

1824
00:55:22,001 --> 00:55:23,290
you ever see that movie charity,

1825
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,040
the Gods,

1826
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,690
they dude got so mad at me.

1827
00:55:25,691 --> 00:55:26,524
It was so funny.

1828
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,890
Cause that's been deep.

1829
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,830
Bunked are you kidding me?

1830
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,830
Are you a child with your information?

1831
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:33,491
And I was like,

1832
00:55:33,491 --> 00:55:33,601
what?

1833
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:37,900
What has been debunked about those
monsters structures that we can recreate

1834
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:38,470
today?

1835
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:38,720
What,

1836
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,060
what has be debunked about,

1837
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:40,480
you know,

1838
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:40,991
but people don't,

1839
00:55:40,991 --> 00:55:41,450
even my,

1840
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:46,270
my wife went to a college for She
Greek history and that was her major.

1841
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:48,790
And so she's fascinated by
like ancient Greece and shit.

1842
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,260
She was talking about the Acropolis,

1843
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:50,981
the Parthenon,

1844
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:51,220
right.

1845
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,680
What people don't understand about
the Parthenon is the top one,

1846
00:55:53,681 --> 00:55:54,220
right?

1847
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:54,581
Yes.

1848
00:55:54,581 --> 00:55:55,930
It's built on the Acropolis.

1849
00:55:55,931 --> 00:56:00,931
The Acropolis is fucking monster stones
that no one even bothers to explain.

1850
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:03,820
They're just,

1851
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:04,061
ah,

1852
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:04,451
yeah,

1853
00:56:04,451 --> 00:56:05,190
some they were,

1854
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,023
it was already there.

1855
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:11,390
You just walk up it and people don't
even realize what they're walking by.

1856
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,880
You are walking by
something that's impossible.

1857
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:14,401
Like you,

1858
00:56:14,401 --> 00:56:16,220
you are stepping on
something that's impossible.

1859
00:56:16,221 --> 00:56:17,180
It's sacred ground.

1860
00:56:17,181 --> 00:56:21,010
Just like Heliopolis in
Lebanon or Bowel Beck.

1861
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,680
Yeah.

1862
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,513
You know,

1863
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,540
they consider it a Roman temple today,

1864
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:26,171
but you know,

1865
00:56:26,171 --> 00:56:29,320
the Romans only took over after the
Greeks and after the Greeks to over and so

1866
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:30,154
on and so forth.

1867
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,450
And uh,

1868
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,493
you know,

1869
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:38,160
they don't know it's the biggest Roman
temple outside of the Roman empire or

1870
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,060
outside of Rome.

1871
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,073
And the question is,

1872
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,660
shouldn't the biggest
temple I've been in Rome,

1873
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:48,220
and the truth is that it wasn't because
they knew what happened at Heliopolis

1874
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,570
thousands of years ago.

1875
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,680
It was sacred.

1876
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:54,760
It's a sacred space like the Acropolis
were allegedly a long time ago,

1877
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,850
Zeus himself to send it from the sky.

1878
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,410
She zoos also descended from the
sky at Heliopolis in Lebanon.

1879
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,680
So it's so fascinating that we have all
these similar stories that all day back

1880
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:10,120
to about the same time.

1881
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:14,590
The bottom line is if
you watch that movie,

1882
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,550
if you look at,

1883
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:16,420
you know,

1884
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,590
the chariots of the gods,

1885
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:18,250
the book,

1886
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,350
if you look at any of these
structures that you brought up,

1887
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:24,490
this Poma punk who there's
some fucking questions,

1888
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:24,790
man.

1889
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:25,623
They are some,

1890
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,660
you cannot say that this is an a mystery.

1891
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:28,900
No,

1892
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,950
this is a mass.

1893
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:30,970
And especially,

1894
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:32,500
especially if we,

1895
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,850
if we are to believe what
the archeologists are doing
that a block of stone,

1896
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:38,620
like this was a,

1897
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:38,981
you know,

1898
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:42,910
cut with copper tools or with chicken
bones and then they pulled it with dental

1899
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,630
floss.

1900
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:43,931
You know,

1901
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:47,200
we have to also remain
within the realms of physics.

1902
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:52,500
You cannot cut a granite stone with a
chicken bones or with a copper tool or a

1903
00:57:53,201 --> 00:57:53,891
bronze tool,

1904
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:56,470
especially this per these
perfect right angles.

1905
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,750
It's completely flat and smooth.

1906
00:57:58,810 --> 00:57:58,961
Oh.

1907
00:57:58,961 --> 00:58:03,400
If you go and touch them with these edges
and you apply a little bit of pressure

1908
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,260
and you lower your thumb or your finger,

1909
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,430
you can cut yourself.

1910
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:08,680
That is how sharp those edges are.

1911
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:09,700
And this,

1912
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,241
by the way,

1913
00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:12,370
thousands of years after they were made,

1914
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,100
yes,

1915
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:14,110
thousand thousand.

1916
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:14,590
Sure,

1917
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:15,070
sure.

1918
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:15,641
We're talking,

1919
00:58:15,641 --> 00:58:15,831
I mean,

1920
00:58:15,831 --> 00:58:16,310
everybody's,

1921
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:17,290
in my opinion,

1922
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:20,350
we're talking at least 12 to 15,000 years.

1923
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,960
Even though the neighboring site,

1924
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:26,170
which is only 250 yards away from Puma,

1925
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:26,980
Pimco is Tiwa.

1926
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:30,560
Norco to knock was a world
famous site in every day.

1927
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,980
Tourists arrive there.

1928
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,380
They'd take pictures of
the Gateway of the son,

1929
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,880
of all those different places,

1930
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:37,301
uh,

1931
00:58:37,301 --> 00:58:38,440
or or artifacts.

1932
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:42,130
But nobody has told and
only 250 yards away,

1933
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,570
it's an even bigger mystery.

1934
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:44,404
Puma Punko.

1935
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,220
Now,

1936
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,890
there are thousands of
glyphs that were found,

1937
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:52,780
hundreds of glyphs that were found at
[inaudible] that have been translated.

1938
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:55,830
And they all say that
this place exists to,

1939
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,070
and aqua exists only because of
the events that happened at Puma,

1940
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:00,130
Puma.

1941
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:02,920
So it's a monument with God's
descending from the sky.

1942
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,150
It's a monument.

1943
00:59:04,151 --> 00:59:09,151
It's a place of pilgrimage and according
to those translations of whatever is on

1944
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:11,590
the backside of the Gateway of the sun,

1945
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:15,700
that significant event
are you guys ready for?

1946
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:18,760
This happened 28,000 years ago.

1947
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:24,660
But our are seeing stuff like this and
they say our ancestors didn't know how to

1948
00:59:26,361 --> 00:59:27,230
keep records.

1949
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,420
They didn't know how to
calculate their years.

1950
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,680
They made mistakes,

1951
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:31,550
this and that,

1952
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:32,960
like Noah was 600 years old.

1953
00:59:32,961 --> 00:59:33,140
Right,

1954
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:33,500
right,

1955
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,101
exactly.

1956
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:35,180
And so that is why,

1957
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:36,270
you know,

1958
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:36,500
uh,

1959
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,170
we cannot pay any credence to,

1960
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,680
uh,

1961
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:39,951
you know,

1962
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:40,671
our ancestors.

1963
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,170
You'd be no was on HGH.

1964
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:43,510
Don't let,

1965
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:43,760
no,

1966
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,211
maybe no,

1967
00:59:44,211 --> 00:59:46,970
it took vitamins and just
went straight Jacko lane on.

1968
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:48,980
But this is the exact,

1969
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,490
you know,

1970
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:53,900
insult to our human ingenuity that I'm
talking about because here we have these,

1971
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:54,770
this giant,

1972
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:55,371
you know,

1973
00:59:55,371 --> 00:59:59,150
gateway where someone or
some artists painstakingly,

1974
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:03,290
you recorded this date and
here we are today saying,

1975
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,940
you didn't know what
the hell you are doing.

1976
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:05,360
Yeah,

1977
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,193
that is,

1978
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:09,110
it's very insulting to say that these
people didn't know what they were talking

1979
01:00:09,111 --> 01:00:09,411
about,

1980
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:13,580
but yet they were able to complete
something that literally we can't do today

1981
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:14,510
and mailing out when you say,

1982
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:14,650
Ooh,

1983
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:14,790
yeah,

1984
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:15,440
you broken.

1985
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,510
Stop saying literally they can't do that.

1986
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:22,660
Do you know what kind of a monumental
fucking construction company you would

1987
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:28,631
need to move a 1000 ton block
bitch to cut and move 1000 tons.

1988
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:30,410
Our,

1989
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:32,090
our cranes today,

1990
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:32,983
Peter out,

1991
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:33,710
and um,

1992
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,670
I might be mistaken,

1993
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:35,810
but somebody told me this,

1994
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:40,100
they Peter out at 1,350 tons,

1995
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:40,840
that's,

1996
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,673
and they're done.

1997
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:42,470
And you know,

1998
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:43,011
having that,

1999
01:00:43,011 --> 01:00:44,890
having that bell back stone or,

2000
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:45,770
or having that,

2001
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:46,230
uh,

2002
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:46,520
you know,

2003
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,440
cornerstone at Heliopolis,

2004
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:51,050
that thing weighs 1000,

2005
01:00:51,051 --> 01:00:52,250
250 tons.

2006
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:53,560
So w you know,

2007
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,040
we're only 100 pounds,

2008
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:56,190
I mean 100 tons off.

2009
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:01,660
But the thing is that this thing was
created at least 8,000 years ago.

2010
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,010
And so,

2011
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:04,580
you know,

2012
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:07,940
to be told that this was all
done with wooden rollers,

2013
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:08,331
man,

2014
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,560
if it was a hundred years ago,

2015
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:13,130
imagine if we were told 200 years
ago before the steam engine,

2016
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,083
because we have

2017
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:17,420
no steam engine was more than 200 years,

2018
01:01:17,421 --> 01:01:17,900
right?

2019
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,800
It's been a few hundred years.

2020
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,240
So let's go 500 years ago.

2021
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:22,400
Could you imagine if we found
out 500 years ago they did this?

2022
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:23,151
They'd be like,

2023
01:01:23,151 --> 01:01:24,980
what the fuck are you talking about?

2024
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,461
And see and,

2025
01:01:25,461 --> 01:01:26,090
and that's,

2026
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:26,630
that's the,

2027
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:27,560
the thing to me that,

2028
01:01:27,561 --> 01:01:27,801
you know,

2029
01:01:27,801 --> 01:01:30,350
how can you even suggest such a thing?

2030
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:31,183
Because,

2031
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,473
you know,

2032
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:34,610
it's tricky because we have records,

2033
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,590
but our records are really shitty.

2034
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,121
You know,

2035
01:01:37,121 --> 01:01:38,420
like just looking at what we know,

2036
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:39,630
like we still stuffed,

2037
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:41,390
fucking just celebrate Columbus Day.

2038
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:44,570
This is why right now it's not,

2039
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:47,090
here's a water Bob behind your laptop.

2040
01:01:47,091 --> 01:01:47,924
It just fell over.

2041
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:48,823
Did it really?

2042
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:49,950
Jesus man's man,

2043
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:51,950
you could ruin my new Alienware.

2044
01:01:51,951 --> 01:01:54,820
Laptops are telling the aliens
would come down and fuck you out.

2045
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,000
It'll be replaced by an alien thing.

2046
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:57,970
I know,

2047
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:01,850
but here's the thing that you know
about us not keeping good records.

2048
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:02,900
We can't keep records,

2049
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:04,010
good records today.

2050
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,360
So how the hell did they do it?

2051
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:06,080
You know,

2052
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:06,850
to kill Kennedy years.

2053
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:11,270
And here's the thing that a lot of
people are freaking out right now,

2054
01:02:11,271 --> 01:02:13,400
but the whole 2012
phenomenon that you know,

2055
01:02:13,401 --> 01:02:14,630
in a 21st of December,

2056
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:15,830
2012 [inaudible] world is gonna end.

2057
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:17,000
It's all bullshit,

2058
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:17,430
man.

2059
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:19,010
I'm just closing right now.

2060
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,490
It's not even

2061
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:24,960
2012 our calendar is off by
at least a hundred years.

2062
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:25,411
But that's,

2063
01:02:25,411 --> 01:02:25,591
you know,

2064
01:02:25,591 --> 01:02:28,800
before I delve into this a
hundred at least at least,

2065
01:02:28,801 --> 01:02:30,100
and I'll give you the arguments in Islam,

2066
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:30,830
not to Leo.

2067
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:31,600
Zoe tries to,

2068
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,170
no,

2069
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:32,311
no,

2070
01:02:32,311 --> 01:02:32,431
no,

2071
01:02:32,431 --> 01:02:32,721
you're,

2072
01:02:32,721 --> 01:02:33,050
you're,

2073
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:33,883
you're months,

2074
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:36,390
your months and your birth month is fine.

2075
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:37,710
Just not the year.

2076
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,680
But the Mayan never suggested.

2077
01:02:40,681 --> 01:02:44,040
Not once that at the
end of their calendar,

2078
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,030
the world will end.

2079
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:46,043
That's all,

2080
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:46,500
you know,

2081
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,910
modern new age bullshit.

2082
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:49,920
This is my thought.

2083
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:53,910
There's a lot of people that just love
believing and like events that events are

2084
01:02:53,911 --> 01:02:54,800
coming love,

2085
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:59,810
like predicting things and the people
that seem to be really into this are

2086
01:03:00,091 --> 01:03:03,000
people that feel like
society cannot evolve.

2087
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:07,890
It has to be taken down and then
we have to rebuild the society.

2088
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:08,724
Like a community,

2089
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:12,150
basically a lot of hippie cult type
people that are looking to fuck your wife,

2090
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,073
right?

2091
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:18,600
Survivalists and shit because with the
thing is all always that they only said

2092
01:03:18,601 --> 01:03:23,460
that a cycle of time will end and after
a calendar and when a calendar ends,

2093
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:24,240
what's next?

2094
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,440
A new period of time.

2095
01:03:25,441 --> 01:03:30,441
A new cycle of time begins afterwards
and so that is exactly what will happen

2096
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,190
because the Maya,

2097
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:37,490
they essentially had knowledge
of a process called precession.

2098
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:42,620
Precession basically means that the
earth is at a certain angle on it's,

2099
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:44,730
but this access that it's on,

2100
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:45,840
it wobbles.

2101
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,930
It makes this big wedding
while it's spinning folks,

2102
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:53,460
there's a 26,000 year cycle where
it wobbles just sort of like a top,

2103
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:53,941
you know,

2104
01:03:53,941 --> 01:03:54,631
or anything else.

2105
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:54,961
It doesn't,

2106
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:56,610
it's not absolutely perfectly in the way.

2107
01:03:56,611 --> 01:03:57,480
It's exactly,

2108
01:03:57,481 --> 01:04:01,080
and because the 2012
phenomena is fantastic,

2109
01:04:01,081 --> 01:04:06,081
are interesting is because that waddled
this rotation returns for the first time

2110
01:04:06,721 --> 01:04:10,290
in 25,600 years to its point of origin.

2111
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,940
Now once that happens,

2112
01:04:11,941 --> 01:04:12,721
which will be,

2113
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:13,021
you know,

2114
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:13,854
soon,

2115
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,220
uh,

2116
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,990
what's going to happen is this wobble.

2117
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:17,610
This has procession cycle going to stop.

2118
01:04:17,611 --> 01:04:18,001
Of course,

2119
01:04:18,001 --> 01:04:18,870
not you.

2120
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:21,630
It'll continue just
like at the end of each,

2121
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,450
each year on the 31st of December,

2122
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:25,740
the following day,

2123
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,030
it's January 1st.

2124
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,690
That is the same thing
with the Mayan calendar.

2125
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:31,140
The world will not end.

2126
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,060
There's no fucking judgment day.

2127
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:35,410
There's no fucking apocalypse there.

2128
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:36,293
No fucking,

2129
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:36,541
you know,

2130
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:38,400
Jesus coming down in a fucking cloud.

2131
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:39,490
But what I think is in is,

2132
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:40,710
and what have you are so wrong.

2133
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:44,460
What if on December 21st you wake
up the fucking skies on fire,

2134
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:45,810
Jesus is on a surfboard.

2135
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,580
Rollerblading.

2136
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:47,851
Yeah,

2137
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:48,151
man.

2138
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,110
What if you're wrong?

2139
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,540
How can you be so confident
that it's not going to end?

2140
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,100
The world could end for you,

2141
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:53,311
right?

2142
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:54,091
When you walk out this door,

2143
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:55,980
you get hit by an asteroid cramp,

2144
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:56,641
a crack,

2145
01:04:56,641 --> 01:04:59,400
open a beer and toasted
Jesus on the surfboard man.

2146
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:03,570
Cause imagine to offices came
back and he was the silver surfer

2147
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:08,160
fucking naked fly around telling
people to love each other.

2148
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:09,220
Yeah.

2149
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,850
I think people recognize that this,

2150
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:16,650
the way we're doing it right now is not
going to be sustainable the way that

2151
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:18,000
we're the ocean,

2152
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,390
the way they were killing all the fish.

2153
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:22,660
And I think people naturally
look to someone to intervene.

2154
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:24,910
Just like when you were a kid
and you lit something on fire,

2155
01:05:24,911 --> 01:05:27,940
you like call dad because you want
someone to come in and intervene.

2156
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,170
And I think for a lot of people,

2157
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:32,140
especially people that fancy
themselves to be intelligent,

2158
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:36,490
two intelligent for religion would
like to believe in something.

2159
01:05:36,491 --> 01:05:40,510
So they go with aliens and they think
that the aliens are going to come down and

2160
01:05:40,511 --> 01:05:41,920
somehow know that they're
going to intervene.

2161
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:42,031
And,

2162
01:05:42,031 --> 01:05:42,521
and so,

2163
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:42,761
and I,

2164
01:05:42,761 --> 01:05:44,560
and I'm very set against that.

2165
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:48,790
I think it's an actual
disservice to this whole field.

2166
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:49,653
Uh,

2167
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:52,210
people who are propagating
ideas like this.

2168
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:54,130
I mean last or two years ago I was asked,

2169
01:05:54,131 --> 01:05:54,760
you know,

2170
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:54,941
hey,

2171
01:05:54,941 --> 01:05:57,960
how come the aliens are not
stopping the oil leak in,

2172
01:05:57,961 --> 01:05:58,170
in,

2173
01:05:58,170 --> 01:05:59,890
in the Gulf of Mexico?

2174
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:00,791
And,

2175
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:01,390
um,

2176
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,223
you know,

2177
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,160
how do you answer that?

2178
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:03,461
It's like,

2179
01:06:03,461 --> 01:06:03,611
well,

2180
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:05,740
because it was us who created,

2181
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:06,580
you say,

2182
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:06,821
well,

2183
01:06:06,821 --> 01:06:10,450
I was talking to them
and say exactly that,

2184
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,470
that crabs and shrimp and things are
just a bunch of country animals and then

2185
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:14,831
not really,

2186
01:06:14,831 --> 01:06:17,010
they don't care if they
get fucked up by oil.

2187
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,340
You know,

2188
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:18,880
I mean,

2189
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,450
the thing to me,

2190
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,150
we can keep having cars.

2191
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:24,310
The aliens are fine with it right now.

2192
01:06:24,311 --> 01:06:26,830
It's just so extremely bizarre to,

2193
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:27,161
you know,

2194
01:06:27,161 --> 01:06:30,580
bank on the idea that to
terrestrial was save us because,

2195
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:31,541
or even Jesus.

2196
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:35,410
Because the thing is that we all know
inherently what's good and what's bad.

2197
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:36,970
We all have a choice to make.

2198
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,340
You either do the right thing
or you did a wrong thing.

2199
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,330
Whatever your,

2200
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,680
your motives are,

2201
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:42,641
but you know,

2202
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:43,120
to,

2203
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,830
to bank upon others,

2204
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:47,410
to salvage the situation is nonsense.

2205
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,660
It's a child is selling.

2206
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,650
It's a childhood thing.

2207
01:06:50,651 --> 01:06:51,190
It's a thing.

2208
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:51,550
You know,

2209
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:51,941
again,

2210
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,950
looking to someone older and smarter,

2211
01:06:53,951 --> 01:06:54,281
yes.

2212
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:55,120
Care of your mess.

2213
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:55,691
Exactly.

2214
01:06:55,691 --> 01:06:56,050
You know,

2215
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:56,620
um,

2216
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,320
but it's,

2217
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,950
it's kind of a weird thing that we want,

2218
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:01,980
we want to be rescued by a daddy.

2219
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:05,050
Daddy's a god or daddy's an alien.

2220
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:05,980
Daddy ain't coming.

2221
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:08,360
But my question is what,

2222
01:07:08,361 --> 01:07:08,470
uh,

2223
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:13,470
what do you think about these different
stories about UFOs hovering around

2224
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:19,320
nuclear test facilities and that shutting
a powered down at certain places,

2225
01:07:19,991 --> 01:07:22,570
stopping missile tests and
things along those lines.

2226
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,070
Do you believe in those stories?

2227
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:25,180
Like I said earlier,

2228
01:07:25,181 --> 01:07:25,481
you know,

2229
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:29,290
I don't follow the modern
Ufo field very closely,

2230
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:30,461
but you know,

2231
01:07:30,461 --> 01:07:33,520
the nuggets that are important,

2232
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,610
this is definitely one
of them where you know,

2233
01:07:36,611 --> 01:07:37,260
there are,

2234
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:37,540
you know,

2235
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:41,950
certain catastrophes that have happened
lately and you would actually see that

2236
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:44,890
right beforehand there would
be some type of UFO activity.

2237
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,300
Now of course,

2238
01:07:46,301 --> 01:07:46,541
you know,

2239
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:51,541
with today's Photoshop technology you
have to be very cautious in this day and

2240
01:07:52,031 --> 01:07:52,510
age.

2241
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:52,841
You know,

2242
01:07:52,841 --> 01:07:56,770
what you can subscribe to and what
you think might be an actual hoax.

2243
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:57,820
And so,

2244
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:58,541
you know,

2245
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,310
not everything is positive with our,

2246
01:08:00,311 --> 01:08:00,521
you know,

2247
01:08:00,521 --> 01:08:01,510
computer developments.

2248
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:02,380
And things like this.

2249
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:03,490
Um,

2250
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:08,490
but the fact that you have full activity
has turned off nuclear power plants is

2251
01:08:09,491 --> 01:08:12,040
not a an idea or an uh,

2252
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:13,623
a rumor.

2253
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,070
There have been military documents from

2254
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:21,070
the 60s that have been recently released
that have recorded exactly such a

2255
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:24,860
events and that's quite fascinating.

2256
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:25,521
Yeah,

2257
01:08:25,521 --> 01:08:26,400
it's quite fascinating.

2258
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:28,850
They would come and let check
these fucking monkeys out.

2259
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,360
Imagine if we went to the Congo and we
found some champs and they had figured

2260
01:08:32,361 --> 01:08:33,320
out how to make guns.

2261
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:33,741
We were like,

2262
01:08:33,741 --> 01:08:34,910
what the fuck are you doing?

2263
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,890
What the fuck are you doing?

2264
01:08:36,891 --> 01:08:37,724
These chimps are,

2265
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:38,751
oh no,

2266
01:08:38,751 --> 01:08:38,931
no,

2267
01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:39,111
no,

2268
01:08:39,111 --> 01:08:39,321
no,

2269
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:39,561
no,

2270
01:08:39,561 --> 01:08:40,251
Nah Bitch,

2271
01:08:40,251 --> 01:08:40,940
Naw Bitch.

2272
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:44,210
We would tranquilizer and we would take
their guns and we would take the really

2273
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:47,000
smart ones that figured out that make
guns and we probably put them in a zoo

2274
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:47,450
somewhere.

2275
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:48,051
Exactly.

2276
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:48,271
We,

2277
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:48,590
we would,

2278
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,030
we would definitely not let that happen.

2279
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:55,210
And the idea is that maybe it's really
fucking super hard to get to earth and

2280
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:58,790
maybe they only come like really rare.

2281
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:01,820
It just seems a long gap
for us a few thousand years.

2282
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:02,930
But for them it ain't shit.

2283
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:03,561
You know,

2284
01:09:03,561 --> 01:09:05,060
it's possible that if you've will know,

2285
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:05,871
because if you,

2286
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:06,170
uh,

2287
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:07,003
if,

2288
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,370
if you fly as if,

2289
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:12,230
if they have that type
of propulsion technology,

2290
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:13,490
if you fly,

2291
01:09:13,491 --> 01:09:14,324
for example,

2292
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:19,630
at a very close to the speed of light
at 99% or 9.9% of the speed of light,

2293
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:26,450
then if five years
elapse on your spaceship,

2294
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,630
5,000 years elapse on earth,

2295
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:30,830
this phenomenon,

2296
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:32,930
anyone can go online and check it out.

2297
01:09:32,931 --> 01:09:36,080
It's called a time dilation phenomenon.

2298
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,240
And this is automatic.

2299
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:37,641
Yes.

2300
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:39,140
And it's a mathematical fact.

2301
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:44,380
So just imagine because we have ancient
stories of these gods that lived in,

2302
01:09:44,841 --> 01:09:48,920
Ain't before the Egyptian Pharaohs
began with their dynasties.

2303
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:54,070
This is all pre dynastic stuff where we
have certain kings ruling 56,000 years

2304
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,820
and it's actually the,

2305
01:09:58,821 --> 01:09:59,180
uh,

2306
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:01,640
the Wy which just keeps coming back pitch.

2307
01:10:01,641 --> 01:10:02,331
What did I tell you?

2308
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:03,110
Fix that shit.

2309
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:04,340
Actually set them a monument.

2310
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:05,750
I'll see in a couple of thousand years.

2311
01:10:05,751 --> 01:10:06,320
Sam,

2312
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,690
imagine you know that this,

2313
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:13,720
this colon called King or space
traveler is on a spaceship for 15 years.

2314
01:10:13,761 --> 01:10:14,181
And you know,

2315
01:10:14,181 --> 01:10:16,430
saunters around the universe
and does something else.

2316
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,880
And then after 54,000 years
have elapsed on earth,

2317
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:25,090
well he basically ruled for 54,000 years
because he never abdicated before he

2318
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:26,270
left.

2319
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:27,800
So that is just,

2320
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:28,250
I mean,

2321
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:32,990
it blows your fucking mind when you look
at these ancient texts and you're like,

2322
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:34,370
what would a really,

2323
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:35,813
yes.

2324
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:36,620
Wow,

2325
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:37,460
that is crazy.

2326
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:41,840
Is it possible that someone
could eventually figure
out how to let something go

2327
01:10:41,841 --> 01:10:44,450
the speed of light without
killing everybody inside of it?

2328
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:46,040
And when they hit a bird,

2329
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:46,993
they thought this,

2330
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,920
when are you going to speed
of light and you hit a bird?

2331
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:49,380
I mean,

2332
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:50,213
you're not going to be,

2333
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:51,450
there'll be pulverized,

2334
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:52,910
you're not going to be
able to dodge birds.

2335
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:54,470
But you question about,

2336
01:10:54,471 --> 01:10:55,250
you know,

2337
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,590
how could you go at this
speed without being crushed?

2338
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:00,830
The asked the same question
when they created cars.

2339
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:01,171
Well,

2340
01:11:01,171 --> 01:11:03,390
how about when the created trains
they thought weren't training.

2341
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,690
If you go 30 miles an hour would kill you.

2342
01:11:05,691 --> 01:11:06,524
That's what they really thought.

2343
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:07,940
Much five and a plane,

2344
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:08,774
you're fine.

2345
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:11,270
Any is newer environment and uh,

2346
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:12,470
you know,

2347
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:14,070
could you imagine getting a dude from like

2348
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,030
the 18 hundreds of thought?

2349
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:17,040
You're going to die in a train
and putting them in a corvette.

2350
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:18,370
She started ready,

2351
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:19,440
but

2352
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,800
just looking at the miles an hour.

2353
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:23,090
He,

2354
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:24,660
if you brought a corvette,

2355
01:11:24,661 --> 01:11:27,180
if you could bring a corvette
like a thousand years ago,

2356
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:28,260
people would,

2357
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,070
they'd be like,

2358
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:29,903
God

2359
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:32,103
under God,

2360
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:33,960
ups undergo which,

2361
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:34,823
and they will kill you.

2362
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:36,450
All the chicks would it blow you?

2363
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:38,790
They would all blow you because
no one else has a corvette.

2364
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:39,953
I mean,

2365
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:43,260
not only do you have a bad ass car
either the only dude on the planet with a

2366
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:43,890
car.

2367
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:44,490
Okay,

2368
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:45,291
chicks would SPI.

2369
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:48,010
So on your jock don't know.

2370
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:48,420
And it's,

2371
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,870
and it's totally fascinating
because that is exactly,

2372
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:52,531
that's what happened.

2373
01:11:52,531 --> 01:11:53,400
That is the idea.

2374
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:54,530
That's the cargo cult died.

2375
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:54,811
Well,

2376
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:55,860
I was thinking today I was,

2377
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:59,370
I was driving in as I often
do when I'm in traffic in La,

2378
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:03,780
that the only way you can really keep
people in line is if you don't let them

2379
01:12:03,781 --> 01:12:04,614
fly around.

2380
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,770
Because as soon as you can imagine,

2381
01:12:07,771 --> 01:12:09,720
if we would have flying cars by now,

2382
01:12:09,721 --> 01:12:10,140
dude,

2383
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,040
there'll be no borders,

2384
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,000
borders and be done,

2385
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,230
it will be death.

2386
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:14,490
You'd have to have nets.

2387
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:14,791
No,

2388
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:19,750
no set up to keep people from flying
over from Mexico like mile high net.

2389
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:22,860
The population would be
decreased by $100 million.

2390
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,630
100 million people
instantaneously really spread out.

2391
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:27,690
Where would they go?

2392
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:30,360
Or they would just crash and die
because they wouldn't know how to handle

2393
01:12:30,361 --> 01:12:31,070
themselves.

2394
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:34,480
If they were magnetized where they were
like two magnets can't come off each

2395
01:12:34,481 --> 01:12:35,250
other,

2396
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:38,910
then you put it on a flying cars
and they're the maglev trains.

2397
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:39,181
No,

2398
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:41,550
they're flying cars with magnets in
the front of them so they could never

2399
01:12:41,551 --> 01:12:42,150
actually touch.

2400
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:42,983
Okay.

2401
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:43,930
I'm always thinking,

2402
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,470
learned to fix the society.

2403
01:12:46,471 --> 01:12:47,890
I'm trying to be a part of Shit.

2404
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,601
Good thing.

2405
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:49,500
The problem.

2406
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,090
Well,

2407
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:51,150
it seems to me if you,

2408
01:12:51,151 --> 01:12:51,510
um,

2409
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,850
listen to the current theory,

2410
01:12:53,851 --> 01:12:55,100
like if you listen to,

2411
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:55,550
um,

2412
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:56,210
what does,

2413
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:58,200
what does that one gentleman's name who's,

2414
01:12:58,201 --> 01:12:58,590
uh,

2415
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:59,670
they always use him.

2416
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:00,061
Stanton.

2417
01:13:00,061 --> 01:13:00,510
Freeman.

2418
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:00,960
Yes.

2419
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:01,231
Yeah.

2420
01:13:01,231 --> 01:13:02,100
He's a,

2421
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:03,070
he's a clear physicist.

2422
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:03,891
Physicist.

2423
01:13:03,891 --> 01:13:05,700
That's a big proponent of,

2424
01:13:05,701 --> 01:13:06,060
uh,

2425
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:06,900
the possibility,

2426
01:13:06,901 --> 01:13:07,900
the reality of Ufos.

2427
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:08,820
Um,

2428
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:09,361
and uh,

2429
01:13:09,361 --> 01:13:09,691
you know,

2430
01:13:09,691 --> 01:13:14,010
he talks about magnetic propulsion systems
at some sort of a magnetic wave could

2431
01:13:14,011 --> 01:13:14,620
be created,

2432
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:16,980
magnetic propulsion systems could be like,

2433
01:13:16,981 --> 01:13:20,250
what is the outside
area when you see like,

2434
01:13:20,251 --> 01:13:20,810
uh,

2435
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,740
like the glow of the saucer,

2436
01:13:22,741 --> 01:13:23,650
what's really going on,

2437
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:25,380
some sort of magnetic sort of a thing.

2438
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,521
If that was a case,

2439
01:13:26,521 --> 01:13:29,430
that would be a way that you could
keep from crashing into each other.

2440
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,260
Like magnets can't touch magnets,

2441
01:13:31,261 --> 01:13:31,450
right.

2442
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,750
Ms Obviously it's different
type of magnetics,

2443
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,100
but I would see if seems like,

2444
01:13:35,101 --> 01:13:35,760
if you can,

2445
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:36,270
you know,

2446
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:37,290
if you can use,

2447
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:37,890
uh,

2448
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:40,170
something and create some
sort of a magnetic field,

2449
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,500
you could possibly also use
it to repel other spaceships.

2450
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:43,711
No,

2451
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:44,130
I agree.

2452
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:45,450
We would stop all car accidents,

2453
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:45,990
but I would,

2454
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:49,740
I would s I would prefer if
before having flying cars,

2455
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:55,130
we now have to realize that we would be
half a technology to build cars or in

2456
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,350
car engines that run on water.

2457
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:00,090
So before we do flying,

2458
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:00,900
flying cars,

2459
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,700
let's run our cars on water,

2460
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:04,470
which as long as they still sound good,

2461
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:05,940
you know,

2462
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:06,660
they can put them.

2463
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:07,410
I like the cartilage.

2464
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:08,041
Sounds good.

2465
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:08,230
I'll,

2466
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:09,900
your car's got a little bass to it,

2467
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:10,860
Paul.

2468
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:10,980
I,

2469
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:11,470
no,

2470
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:12,303
it feels good.

2471
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,390
It makes me feel American.

2472
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:14,400
Want to listen to some fine.

2473
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:18,190
There will be some company
they will come up with it.

2474
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:19,263
And uh,

2475
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:19,571
well,

2476
01:14:19,571 --> 01:14:19,841
you know,

2477
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:22,420
BMW is cheating right
now and they're m fives.

2478
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:23,400
I'm really disappointed.

2479
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:24,100
BMW,

2480
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,210
how dare you do this.

2481
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:29,530
They switched over from naturally
aspirated engines to turbocharged engines.

2482
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:30,311
And when you do that,

2483
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:33,770
you send forced air into the engine and,

2484
01:14:33,771 --> 01:14:33,981
and it,

2485
01:14:33,981 --> 01:14:35,590
it muffles the sound.

2486
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:40,800
It doesn't give you that deep like
v eight Shelby Mustang feeling blah.

2487
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,270
They lose all that sound.

2488
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:47,530
And so the latest m m m five the old one,

2489
01:14:47,531 --> 01:14:48,311
the last model,

2490
01:14:48,311 --> 01:14:49,450
which was an amazing car,

2491
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:52,690
500 plus horsepower was a v 10.

2492
01:14:52,691 --> 01:14:53,980
It was a large nationally,

2493
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,540
naturally aspirated engine,

2494
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:57,560
but now they've switched
over to turbochargers.

2495
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:02,580
So because people love the sound like
the old BMW m five was fucking glorious.

2496
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,860
The sound that thing would
hit when it hits red line.

2497
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,340
It's like,

2498
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:06,641
to me,

2499
01:15:06,641 --> 01:15:10,240
I may freak when it comes to
engineering and technology.

2500
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:15,390
I am absolutely fascinated
by the automobile industry
because although everybody

2501
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:17,410
like likes to think of them as like,

2502
01:15:17,411 --> 01:15:18,430
it's like Frivolous,

2503
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:18,641
Oh,

2504
01:15:18,641 --> 01:15:19,870
you have a nice car,

2505
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:20,500
you know?

2506
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:20,831
Oh,

2507
01:15:20,831 --> 01:15:21,131
you know,

2508
01:15:21,131 --> 01:15:22,600
you're fucking materialistic.

2509
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:23,140
Oh,

2510
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:27,340
I am celebrating cool shit
that human beings have created.

2511
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:30,460
And one of the coolest things that's
going on in the world when it comes to

2512
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:32,440
innovation is the automobile industry.

2513
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:35,200
When you look at like
high end automobiles,

2514
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:35,521
like the,

2515
01:15:35,521 --> 01:15:38,660
the craftsmanship and
intelligence that it's involved,

2516
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:40,510
even if I couldn't afford a nice car,

2517
01:15:40,511 --> 01:15:42,040
I would still be fascinated.

2518
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:45,850
I would always read those magazines
just same way I read Gizmodo or uh,

2519
01:15:45,851 --> 01:15:46,340
you know,

2520
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:46,600
uh,

2521
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,940
we'll buy a copy of wired or end gadget.

2522
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,370
I'm fascinated by the innovation.

2523
01:15:51,371 --> 01:15:53,200
I'm fascinated by the continual,

2524
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:53,710
uh,

2525
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:55,840
the need of d to improve things.

2526
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,310
And when you see it in cars,

2527
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,320
it's incredible what they're doing now.

2528
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:04,410
But BMW unfortunately had to resort to
cheating to make their car sound good.

2529
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,640
So now it comes through the stereo.

2530
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:11,440
There's a v eight sound that comes
through the steroids that sync up with the

2531
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:12,730
computer and the engine.

2532
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:14,160
So as you're revving your car,

2533
01:16:14,161 --> 01:16:14,994
it's gone.

2534
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,260
That's not real.

2535
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:19,510
It's coming through your
fucking stereo speakers

2536
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:22,780
that told me that's a joke.

2537
01:16:22,781 --> 01:16:24,040
Please BMW.

2538
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:25,060
How dare you?

2539
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,070
How dare you?

2540
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:28,533
How dare you?

2541
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:28,841
Well,

2542
01:16:28,841 --> 01:16:30,940
you know Nissan doesn't
do that with the GTR.

2543
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:31,130
I,

2544
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:31,460
I,

2545
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:36,220
I the GTR is one of the fastest cars in
the world and it sounds like a fucking

2546
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:36,820
spaceship.

2547
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:39,820
It's a different sound
that turbocharger Ooh,

2548
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:40,930
it's a different sound,

2549
01:16:40,931 --> 01:16:42,850
but it's still fucking bad ass.

2550
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,940
You got to accept the fact that
this doesn't sound like a Va.

2551
01:16:45,941 --> 01:16:47,470
It sounds like a force induction car,

2552
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:48,520
which may not have.

2553
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,340
It's not as sweet and
as like manly a note,

2554
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:53,140
but it's still pretty fucking trippy.

2555
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,790
You've got to accept what
your car sounds like.

2556
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:55,624
BMW.

2557
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:56,231
I was actually,

2558
01:16:56,231 --> 01:16:57,760
when you're saying this story,

2559
01:16:57,761 --> 01:16:58,120
I was like,

2560
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:58,361
oh,

2561
01:16:58,361 --> 01:16:59,020
the day there,

2562
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,220
it's just not as loud anywhere.

2563
01:17:00,221 --> 01:17:00,490
I was like,

2564
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,181
they shouldn't have it.

2565
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:01,961
Go through this stereo.

2566
01:17:01,961 --> 01:17:02,860
So you think it is.

2567
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:05,960
I was thinking that's
what I fill up first.

2568
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:06,550
That's what I,

2569
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:07,630
how I understood it too.

2570
01:17:07,631 --> 01:17:08,410
Right.

2571
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:10,280
And then it was like they're cheating.

2572
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:10,660
That's,

2573
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:11,550
that's worse.

2574
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:12,451
Make noise,

2575
01:17:12,451 --> 01:17:12,641
you know,

2576
01:17:12,641 --> 01:17:13,570
worse than idea.

2577
01:17:13,571 --> 01:17:14,404
Yeah.

2578
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:14,990
We thought,

2579
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:16,540
well the Porsche,

2580
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,480
the new Porsche,

2581
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,170
um,

2582
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:20,060
one of the things they've
done with the nine nine one,

2583
01:17:20,061 --> 01:17:20,391
the palm,

2584
01:17:20,391 --> 01:17:23,660
I'm a huge fan of Porsche's and I know
it sounds like such a douche bag thing to

2585
01:17:23,661 --> 01:17:24,170
say.

2586
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:24,531
It's like,

2587
01:17:24,531 --> 01:17:24,651
oh,

2588
01:17:24,651 --> 01:17:25,880
you like Porsche.

2589
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:26,810
You know what else you do?

2590
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:27,021
Like,

2591
01:17:27,021 --> 01:17:28,100
do you like playing Polo?

2592
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:29,000
You fucking queer.

2593
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:29,990
You know,

2594
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:32,150
it sounds like something
like the privileged people,

2595
01:17:32,151 --> 01:17:32,691
but again,

2596
01:17:32,691 --> 01:17:34,250
I'm a freak for engineering.

2597
01:17:34,251 --> 01:17:39,251
I'm absolutely fascinated by technological
innovation and cars have come so far

2598
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:41,060
in my lifetime,

2599
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,170
when I was a kid,

2600
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,530
my first car was a 1973 Chevy Chevelle.

2601
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:48,080
It was a piece of shit was a Chevelle ss.

2602
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:50,540
I had it for one day and
it wouldn't fucking start.

2603
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:51,860
And I called the dude up and go,

2604
01:17:51,861 --> 01:17:52,061
man,

2605
01:17:52,061 --> 01:17:53,570
it's fucking car doesn't even start like,

2606
01:17:53,571 --> 01:17:54,710
what's wrong with this fucking car?

2607
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:55,350
And the guy goes,

2608
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:56,121
you can give back to me.

2609
01:17:56,121 --> 01:17:57,020
I'll give you your money back.

2610
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:57,440
And I was like,

2611
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,670
oh you knew it was a piece of shit.

2612
01:17:58,671 --> 01:17:59,504
You son of a bitch.

2613
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,270
So I brought it back to him
and he gave my money back.

2614
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,900
But when you look at that and then you
look at like a Porsche nine 11 like they

2615
01:18:05,901 --> 01:18:07,070
just released the newest one,

2616
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:10,940
the nine nine one it's a
technological masterpiece.

2617
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,650
They have dual clutches now.

2618
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:15,260
You know I prefer a manual gearbox.

2619
01:18:15,261 --> 01:18:16,570
I like shifting my own fears.

2620
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:17,100
It's fun.

2621
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:21,800
Mine has dual clutch is hearing your
Volkswagen does as you're driving annual,

2622
01:18:21,801 --> 01:18:22,520
are you kidding me?

2623
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,320
You shared with the paddles.

2624
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:27,740
These paddles shift in like milliseconds.

2625
01:18:27,741 --> 01:18:31,700
It used to be that automatic sucked and
the reason why you know you got a a four

2626
01:18:31,701 --> 01:18:33,530
speed is cause it was actually faster.

2627
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:34,640
Five-Speed was fast,

2628
01:18:34,641 --> 01:18:35,690
six speed was faster.

2629
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:40,400
But then somewhere along the line that's
the automatics in like they caught up

2630
01:18:40,401 --> 01:18:43,940
to the the manual cars and then
they surpassed him like greatly.

2631
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:48,200
Now if like a manual
Porsche is like 4.6 seconds,

2632
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:53,350
zero to 60 but the automatic you can get
that bitch down to like 3.9 3.6 because

2633
01:18:54,201 --> 01:18:55,270
they have this um,

2634
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:58,340
this dual clutch that where
you can have a launch control,

2635
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,430
like you stop on the gas and it
does it all with the computer.

2636
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:05,360
You stop on the gas and just let off the
brake and it just calculates the amount

2637
01:19:05,361 --> 01:19:07,250
of wheel spin controls.

2638
01:19:07,251 --> 01:19:11,330
It gives you the perfect
amount of acceleration and
it just goes like a fucking

2639
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:12,164
Bat Outta hell.

2640
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,170
They have a launch
control and a Nissan Gtr,

2641
01:19:15,171 --> 01:19:18,260
which was like one of the
most technologically advanced
cars that humans have

2642
01:19:18,261 --> 01:19:18,711
ever created.

2643
01:19:18,711 --> 01:19:21,290
It's a car that they're actually
losing money on selling.

2644
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:25,550
It's such an incredible masterpiece of
technology and they want in it to Nissan.

2645
01:19:25,551 --> 01:19:28,580
So they sell it for like a hundred
grand and they lose money on each one,

2646
01:19:28,581 --> 01:19:30,290
but it's their flagship when it hit.

2647
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,760
When you do launch control and the Nissan,

2648
01:19:31,761 --> 01:19:34,370
it brings you to 2.8 seconds,

2649
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:37,580
zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds.

2650
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:38,693
Wild.

2651
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,610
Does it depend what
surface you're on though?

2652
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,000
Sure.

2653
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,211
Yeah,

2654
01:19:41,211 --> 01:19:41,781
absolutely.

2655
01:19:41,781 --> 01:19:44,720
Of course you would like to be on a
race track ideally where it's nice and

2656
01:19:44,721 --> 01:19:45,650
smooth and flat,

2657
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,760
but you know,

2658
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:47,201
it's,

2659
01:19:47,201 --> 01:19:52,201
it's an incredible masterpiece
of engineering and what
they've done with Porsche

2660
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:53,084
at the combat,

2661
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:54,980
the sound issue is they,

2662
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:55,101
uh,

2663
01:19:55,101 --> 01:19:56,990
they just made a better
fucking exhaust system.

2664
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,760
That's how Germans
rocket for the most part.

2665
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,310
They didn't cheat like
those other BMW assholes.

2666
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,280
I just think it was it just
a bad idea that someone,

2667
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:06,180
someone talked them into
doing their property.

2668
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,500
That's horrible if true.

2669
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:07,680
I mean,

2670
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,100
I believe

2671
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:08,221
it,

2672
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:09,120
but that's just,

2673
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,500
it just does not seem real.

2674
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:10,771
Yeah.

2675
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:11,040
No.

2676
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:11,220
Well,

2677
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,060
BMW in Germany,

2678
01:20:12,190 --> 01:20:14,950
that's Sturman do you read it
all in or all local first year?

2679
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:16,290
It's real.

2680
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:17,123
It's real.

2681
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:17,791
The Porsche,

2682
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:18,601
that solution is,

2683
01:20:18,601 --> 01:20:19,160
they have it.

2684
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,750
I'm baffled that were the sound.

2685
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:21,971
Uh,

2686
01:20:21,971 --> 01:20:22,471
there's like a,

2687
01:20:22,471 --> 01:20:26,580
a valve that they can open up or the
sound like enters into the cabin more,

2688
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,950
but it's a rich sounding
exhaust note anyway,

2689
01:20:28,951 --> 01:20:30,240
they figured out how
to do it the right way,

2690
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:31,980
but that's a naturally aspirated car.

2691
01:20:31,981 --> 01:20:32,700
The new Porsche.

2692
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:33,810
When you get into turbos,

2693
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:35,850
you just got to deal with the
fact that it's a different sound.

2694
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,890
That's one of the
coolest things about the,

2695
01:20:37,891 --> 01:20:38,430
um,

2696
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:38,880
you know,

2697
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,180
the,

2698
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:41,460
the a Ufo is that people see that they,

2699
01:20:41,461 --> 01:20:42,840
they say they're fucking silent.

2700
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:44,970
Like those ones that flew over Phoenix,

2701
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:46,171
they say that,

2702
01:20:46,171 --> 01:20:46,411
you know,

2703
01:20:46,411 --> 01:20:50,970
this is gigantic triangle that's a flying
through the air and it's completely

2704
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:54,840
silent and you see like little glowing
lights around the edges of it and shit.

2705
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:55,291
Your pants,

2706
01:20:55,291 --> 01:20:56,940
cause it's as big as a football field.

2707
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:57,750
Right.

2708
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:00,180
Do you believe that the Phoenix
lights story and all that shit?

2709
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:01,011
It is a,

2710
01:21:01,011 --> 01:21:01,844
it's a different,

2711
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:05,730
it's definitely an interesting
story and I've seen the footage.

2712
01:21:05,731 --> 01:21:06,060
It's,

2713
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,320
it's quite bizarre.

2714
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:08,490
And the flares though,

2715
01:21:08,491 --> 01:21:09,000
right?

2716
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:09,620
Couldn't it be fun?

2717
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:10,081
Oh no,

2718
01:21:10,081 --> 01:21:13,470
because they didn't come down kind of
hovered the way that the players would

2719
01:21:13,471 --> 01:21:15,600
come down and you know,

2720
01:21:15,601 --> 01:21:19,290
the whole Ufo field to me is why not.

2721
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:19,981
Right.

2722
01:21:19,981 --> 01:21:21,840
It could be because you know,

2723
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:26,900
I know personally that a lot of UFO
stories or abduction stories or stories by

2724
01:21:27,271 --> 01:21:28,230
experiencers,

2725
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:29,260
they're all made up.

2726
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,600
A lot of them are made up.

2727
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:31,830
I know some people that,

2728
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:32,760
um,

2729
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:36,450
have told me that they made
stuff up and so first of all,

2730
01:21:36,451 --> 01:21:38,520
it's a huge disservice
to the entire field.

2731
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:40,860
And it's funny that you
keep calling it a field.

2732
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:42,000
Well,

2733
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,140
it is a field of study,

2734
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:45,810
I guess it is or topic when it comes,

2735
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:49,680
when actually when the shit hits the
fan and then Ufo or fucking for sure.

2736
01:21:49,681 --> 01:21:51,570
Really here then it's a field.

2737
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:52,250
Yeah,

2738
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:53,011
100% yeah.

2739
01:21:53,011 --> 01:21:53,890
But then still a field,

2740
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:55,090
all the bunkers,

2741
01:21:55,091 --> 01:21:56,910
hilly field and then all
the debunkers we'll say,

2742
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:57,360
well,

2743
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,590
we knew it all along,

2744
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:00,180
but we just couldn't say something.

2745
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,380
You think so you watch?

2746
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,273
Absolutely.

2747
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:02,970
Wow.

2748
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:03,721
That's interesting.

2749
01:22:03,721 --> 01:22:04,554
Sure.

2750
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:06,300
People like Erich von Daniken,

2751
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:06,581
Zacharias,

2752
01:22:06,581 --> 01:22:08,340
Zechariah stitching will
be left by the wayside.

2753
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:12,480
So he's all this tumor
ologists all the Egyptologists,

2754
01:22:12,481 --> 01:22:12,691
they're all,

2755
01:22:12,691 --> 01:22:12,801
Yo,

2756
01:22:12,801 --> 01:22:12,971
Yo,

2757
01:22:12,971 --> 01:22:13,230
whoa.

2758
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:14,610
We just couldn't talk about it.

2759
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:15,211
Wow.

2760
01:22:15,211 --> 01:22:16,590
You really think that's what's going on.

2761
01:22:16,591 --> 01:22:17,400
Absolutely.

2762
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,900
That'd be fucking fascinating.

2763
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,220
Would be hilarious to watch.

2764
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:25,140
It'd be hilarious to watch the mad
scramble if we really saw actual UFO.

2765
01:22:25,330 --> 01:22:25,861
You believe it.

2766
01:22:25,861 --> 01:22:27,600
That's why it would be in my opinion,

2767
01:22:27,601 --> 01:22:32,310
I think pandemonium because I think people
like you and me and red band and all

2768
01:22:32,311 --> 01:22:33,300
of our listeners,

2769
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:33,841
you know,

2770
01:22:33,841 --> 01:22:35,000
they will be quite all right.

2771
01:22:35,001 --> 01:22:35,671
Cause you know,

2772
01:22:35,671 --> 01:22:39,540
you'd be crazy not to think
that we're alone and um,

2773
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:40,403
you know,

2774
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:45,150
but I think the great majority of
of mankind they would freak out.

2775
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:45,960
Yeah.

2776
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,960
Or what the aliens really are is the
people that are keeping us trapped in the

2777
01:22:52,471 --> 01:22:57,471
simulation and that we live in some really
boring ass fucking future where they

2778
01:22:58,921 --> 01:23:02,940
figured out how to make sex is not
the way you make babies anymore.

2779
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:05,100
Everything's done through
replication and genetics.

2780
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:06,250
They have orgasm pills

2781
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,180
so nobody fucks.

2782
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:07,841
Like in the,

2783
01:23:07,841 --> 01:23:08,500
in the uh,

2784
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,570
judge Dredd Stallone version did that,

2785
01:23:10,571 --> 01:23:12,640
what they did in judge
Dredd exactly like dad,

2786
01:23:12,641 --> 01:23:16,030
they devolve to aliens yet and
the judge Dredd or evolve rather,

2787
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:19,990
I know they have to think our big heads
is troll shit telepathically and not the

2788
01:23:19,991 --> 01:23:22,840
big eyes cause anything
can see the whole space.

2789
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:26,870
You get to see you if my gear and
everything is controlled with their minds.

2790
01:23:26,871 --> 01:23:30,580
So they got like shit for like
physiques cause they don't care.

2791
01:23:30,581 --> 01:23:31,570
They're not trying to get laid.

2792
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:33,340
You don't have to be all swol terrible.

2793
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:33,880
You know,

2794
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,290
aliens never tried to be yoked.

2795
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:36,543
They don't give a fuck.

2796
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,200
So what if the aliens are us?

2797
01:23:38,201 --> 01:23:40,390
It's like if you looked at us and monkeys,

2798
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:40,900
okay,

2799
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:45,370
we know for a fact that human beings
were some sort of primate that was

2800
01:23:45,371 --> 01:23:46,840
initially different than it is now.

2801
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:47,321
Okay?

2802
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:48,100
That's pretty,

2803
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:52,420
pretty much agreed upon by the
evolutionary theorists that you know,

2804
01:23:52,421 --> 01:23:53,650
there's our [inaudible],

2805
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:56,440
there was a bunch of different
types of human beings,

2806
01:23:56,441 --> 01:23:59,050
and then homo sapiens
emerged at one point in time.

2807
01:23:59,200 --> 01:23:59,381
Well,

2808
01:23:59,381 --> 01:24:01,810
whatever the fuck create
what if you look it out?

2809
01:24:01,811 --> 01:24:03,520
We had to somehow or another,

2810
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,350
we were something else
at one point in time.

2811
01:24:05,351 --> 01:24:07,190
That's the whole idea behind the,

2812
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,560
the idea of evolution.

2813
01:24:08,561 --> 01:24:08,951
And again,

2814
01:24:08,951 --> 01:24:11,230
I'm too stupid to understand
whether or not evolutions real.

2815
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,670
That's an entirely different argument.

2816
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:13,151
Well,

2817
01:24:13,151 --> 01:24:14,140
even Darwin is,

2818
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,900
look how much different we
are than a monkey and aliens.

2819
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:18,100
Not that much different than us.

2820
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:22,990
Or You look at a gray alien with the
big fucking almond eyes and the big head

2821
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:25,990
and the fact that it has two
arms and two legs and stands up,

2822
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:29,050
it actually looks more like
us than a gorilla does,

2823
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:29,890
you know,

2824
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:31,720
or a monkey with a tail,

2825
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:32,170
you know,

2826
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:34,990
or some of the other crazy
primates that we know for sure.

2827
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:35,823
A real,

2828
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:38,440
if you look at a backbone and you look
at a person and you look at a person,

2829
01:24:38,441 --> 01:24:39,161
you're looking at an alien.

2830
01:24:39,161 --> 01:24:41,710
I think an alien looks more like
a person than about Boone does.

2831
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:42,670
Right?

2832
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:42,881
No,

2833
01:24:42,881 --> 01:24:43,331
I agree.

2834
01:24:43,331 --> 01:24:44,021
And that is why,

2835
01:24:44,021 --> 01:24:44,231
you know,

2836
01:24:44,231 --> 01:24:45,190
Darwin himself,

2837
01:24:45,191 --> 01:24:46,480
he suggested that,

2838
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:46,601
uh,

2839
01:24:46,601 --> 01:24:46,991
you know,

2840
01:24:46,991 --> 01:24:48,340
he liked his own theory.

2841
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:49,181
However,

2842
01:24:49,181 --> 01:24:51,460
in the end he had to conclude
there was a missing link.

2843
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:54,220
There was something that despite
everything doesn't make sense,

2844
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:55,240
and today's,

2845
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,073
it's a hologram.

2846
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,130
That shit ain't real.

2847
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:57,761
Well,

2848
01:24:57,761 --> 01:24:59,290
we're in a simulation.

2849
01:24:59,330 --> 01:24:59,980
Giorgio,

2850
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:01,720
we exist in a boring ass few.

2851
01:25:01,721 --> 01:25:02,590
Never say never.

2852
01:25:02,591 --> 01:25:02,831
You know,

2853
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:03,150
I mean,

2854
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:03,580
I,

2855
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:04,030
I,

2856
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:05,440
I choose to disagree,

2857
01:25:05,441 --> 01:25:06,480
but we never say never.

2858
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:07,450
Why do you disagree though?

2859
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:08,141
I don't know.

2860
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:08,301
I,

2861
01:25:08,301 --> 01:25:09,730
it's not high enough.

2862
01:25:09,731 --> 01:25:14,200
You're not high enough to be right
here with got the ridiculous.

2863
01:25:14,201 --> 01:25:17,560
What if train is to opt to pockets?

2864
01:25:17,561 --> 01:25:17,820
What?

2865
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:18,820
Tupac is our king

2866
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,153
in this Hologram,

2867
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:23,800
Hologram Tupacs running
shift in the future.

2868
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:25,660
He's really good at rhyming,

2869
01:25:25,661 --> 01:25:26,051
so they said,

2870
01:25:26,051 --> 01:25:26,351
listen,

2871
01:25:26,351 --> 01:25:27,190
you should be in charge.

2872
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:28,250
You rhyme.

2873
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:29,380
The fucking shit out of words.

2874
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:35,830
Isn't that amazing that all you have to
do is be like really good at talking and

2875
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:36,191
people are like,

2876
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:37,420
please keep talking.

2877
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:38,800
How do you do it?

2878
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:40,840
How do you keep rhyming things?

2879
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:41,681
Biggie,

2880
01:25:41,681 --> 01:25:41,951
Biggie,

2881
01:25:41,951 --> 01:25:42,431
biggie.

2882
01:25:42,431 --> 01:25:44,470
Can't you see sometimes you wear,

2883
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,670
they hypnotize me.

2884
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:46,841
How does he do that?

2885
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:47,630
He was alien.

2886
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:48,463
Doesn't matter man.

2887
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:48,941
Yeah.

2888
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:51,310
That's the funniest meme
online as you buddy.

2889
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:52,000
Yeah,

2890
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,481
all your,

2891
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,850
I didn't hear the question
but the answer is aliens.

2892
01:25:55,770 --> 01:25:57,130
What if you must love that though?

2893
01:25:57,131 --> 01:25:58,300
That is so bad ass.

2894
01:25:58,330 --> 01:25:59,170
It's awesome.

2895
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,960
I mean how can you even not love it?

2896
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:04,100
It's absolutely fantastic
and some those memes that,

2897
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,290
I mean they crack me up for real.

2898
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:07,230
Even even the,

2899
01:26:07,231 --> 01:26:07,351
the,

2900
01:26:07,351 --> 01:26:07,730
the,

2901
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:08,750
the crappy ones.

2902
01:26:08,751 --> 01:26:09,411
I mean they're still there.

2903
01:26:09,411 --> 01:26:13,370
It's all funny because if you imagine
people out there that are going through an

2904
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:14,510
effort to,

2905
01:26:14,511 --> 01:26:14,750
to,

2906
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,040
to write something and I think,

2907
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:16,490
you know,

2908
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:17,060
thanks.

2909
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:17,810
It's cool.

2910
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:18,570
Thanks to everyone.

2911
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:19,110
Seriously.

2912
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:20,640
I love fucking awesome.

2913
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,350
There's a bunch of me about weed.

2914
01:26:22,351 --> 01:26:24,420
One of them was sometimes
I don't smoke weed.

2915
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:25,283
Yes I do.

2916
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,473
It's,

2917
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:28,801
it's,

2918
01:26:28,801 --> 01:26:29,071
they're,

2919
01:26:29,071 --> 01:26:29,671
they're awesome.

2920
01:26:29,671 --> 01:26:29,911
Mad.

2921
01:26:29,911 --> 01:26:32,970
The Internet has created some of
the my favorite comedy of all time.

2922
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:37,380
Even shit that's like really completely
inappropriate and he shouldn't laugh at

2923
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:38,460
10 was at one.

2924
01:26:38,461 --> 01:26:38,721
There were,

2925
01:26:38,721 --> 01:26:41,130
there's as this black guy
that had his mouth open,

2926
01:26:41,131 --> 01:26:46,131
his eyes were bugged out of his head and
he was surrounded by watermelons and it

2927
01:26:46,261 --> 01:26:46,590
said,

2928
01:26:46,590 --> 01:26:48,960
Oh Lourdes is I in heaven.

2929
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,003
And I know,

2930
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,770
I know it's rude and it's racist,

2931
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:56,100
but I'm fuck I was crying laughing.

2932
01:26:56,101 --> 01:26:57,600
I was like that is wrong.

2933
01:26:57,601 --> 01:26:58,620
As fucked up.

2934
01:26:58,740 --> 01:26:59,580
But God damn,

2935
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:00,420
that shit is funny.

2936
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:03,900
Cause if you see the look on the guy's
face is ridiculous and the fucking

2937
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:04,780
watermelon.

2938
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:09,120
So why is it racist to fucking say
someone likes a delicious fruit?

2939
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:09,481
I don't know.

2940
01:27:09,481 --> 01:27:13,800
Cause I love watermelon
grape drink and everything.

2941
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:14,610
How about chicken?

2942
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:15,690
Chicken is delicious,

2943
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:19,380
but isn't it fucked up that you
can say like if say you chicken,

2944
01:27:19,381 --> 01:27:19,951
watermelon,

2945
01:27:19,951 --> 01:27:21,270
Eaton person,

2946
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:21,761
you know,

2947
01:27:21,761 --> 01:27:22,320
they'll like that.

2948
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,280
That's an insult.

2949
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:23,941
You're an asshole.

2950
01:27:23,941 --> 01:27:24,870
You're racist.

2951
01:27:25,170 --> 01:27:25,881
Why black people?

2952
01:27:25,881 --> 01:27:26,580
Who's eating chicken?

2953
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:27,450
Fuck you.

2954
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:29,380
Well meanwhile chickens are delicious.

2955
01:27:29,381 --> 01:27:29,640
Yeah,

2956
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:30,570
what's wrong with that?

2957
01:27:30,571 --> 01:27:31,230
Meat and chicken.

2958
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:32,430
There's nothing wrong with that.

2959
01:27:32,431 --> 01:27:33,390
But if you say,

2960
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,040
why are black people
always eating chicken?

2961
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:35,251
They're like,

2962
01:27:35,251 --> 01:27:35,431
man,

2963
01:27:35,431 --> 01:27:36,510
you're a racist bitch.

2964
01:27:36,890 --> 01:27:37,723
They get mad at you.

2965
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,060
It's bullshit.

2966
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:39,870
It is bullshit.

2967
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:40,041
But it,

2968
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:41,160
cause if you ask an Italian,

2969
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:41,551
you know,

2970
01:27:41,551 --> 01:27:43,920
you post heat and motherfucker
and Billy posture's pretty good.

2971
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:46,050
Luckin was audience delicious.

2972
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,340
You know what the fuck is wrong with you?

2973
01:27:47,341 --> 01:27:48,510
Like delicious food.

2974
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:50,760
How sensitive are black people
when it comes to their diet?

2975
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,190
Well,

2976
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:52,760
I don't know.

2977
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,800
Italians are pretty sensitive
though because they get mad.

2978
01:27:54,801 --> 01:27:56,060
Like you get mad at olive garden.

2979
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:57,183
No,

2980
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:02,540
no Italians.

2981
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:04,420
There's a some weak ass bitch of times.

2982
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:06,050
Just like there's weak
ass bitch everything.

2983
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:07,071
But you know,

2984
01:28:07,071 --> 01:28:10,820
like the people that were protesting
about the soprano's that made me disgusted

2985
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:11,721
and made me glad.

2986
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:13,530
And I'm an Italian last name and he said,

2987
01:28:13,531 --> 01:28:14,540
I got an Irish last time,

2988
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:19,130
like you'd dummies Italian American
association that's a Pronto was on fairly

2989
01:28:19,131 --> 01:28:20,930
represents us into media.

2990
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:24,050
You should fall New
Jersey housewives pitch.

2991
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:24,261
Okay.

2992
01:28:24,261 --> 01:28:25,760
That's when the Italians are really like,

2993
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:26,923
fuck you.

2994
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:27,950
There's plenty of them.

2995
01:28:27,951 --> 01:28:28,681
God Damn it though.

2996
01:28:28,681 --> 01:28:29,690
That's my people.

2997
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:30,920
So I'm allowed to shit on them.

2998
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:33,050
It's like a black people
allowed to use the word nigger.

2999
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,280
Like Chris Rock had that,

3000
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:34,730
uh,

3001
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:38,270
that bit the one of the greatest
bits of all time and all comedy.

3002
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,800
I love black people.

3003
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:40,850
I hate niggers,

3004
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:43,790
but that is a genius bit by Chris Rock,

3005
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:44,270
what I,

3006
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:45,103
my opinion,

3007
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,550
top two or three,

3008
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:47,570
all time bits,

3009
01:28:47,571 --> 01:28:50,300
any human being has ever created
and he could get away with that.

3010
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:52,520
Whereas Brian Red band would
just get rocks thrown at them.

3011
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:54,320
I had to do a,

3012
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,150
my first kind of black room the other day,

3013
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:59,680
I did that downtown comedy
club and it's black rock.

3014
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,560
It's not a black room,

3015
01:29:00,561 --> 01:29:01,394
but it's,

3016
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:02,303
and it's like,

3017
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:03,870
it's just people walking
on the street going,

3018
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:04,051
hey,

3019
01:29:04,051 --> 01:29:04,980
let's go see a comedy show.

3020
01:29:04,981 --> 01:29:06,840
So there were people there
with their whole entire,

3021
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:08,850
I don't know what that was.

3022
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,200
It was German,

3023
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,273
but uh,

3024
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,530
but they sat in the front
row tourists and shit.

3025
01:29:13,531 --> 01:29:13,681
Yeah.

3026
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:15,570
They're all wearing like
their suits and stuff.

3027
01:29:15,571 --> 01:29:16,051
Like they were like,

3028
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:17,880
we're going out and seeing a live show.

3029
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:18,090
Oh.

3030
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:19,980
Because a lot of people like
work there and those silos.

3031
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:20,670
Yeah.

3032
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:21,510
And so it was,

3033
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,051
it was,

3034
01:29:22,051 --> 01:29:24,480
it was weird because they don't,

3035
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:24,991
I don't know,

3036
01:29:24,991 --> 01:29:26,460
I feel like a disgusted them,

3037
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:26,950
you know,

3038
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:29,160
like they're talking about sex.

3039
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:29,610
They were just like,

3040
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:32,010
you have to understand that
if people don't know you,

3041
01:29:32,011 --> 01:29:32,730
your gross.

3042
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:33,480
Right.

3043
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:34,080
Do you know that?

3044
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:34,500
Right.

3045
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,440
People love you if they know you well,

3046
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:37,080
he's like,

3047
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:37,711
listen man,

3048
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:38,161
this is,

3049
01:29:38,161 --> 01:29:39,330
this is the way of the world.

3050
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,010
You have to find your audience.

3051
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:41,551
You know,

3052
01:29:41,551 --> 01:29:42,540
people right now,

3053
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:45,060
people will come to see you and they
love you because they hear you on the

3054
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:46,470
podcast and because they,

3055
01:29:46,471 --> 01:29:46,780
they,

3056
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:47,281
they like,

3057
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:48,540
you're silly sense of humor.

3058
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,980
But if they did know you,

3059
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:50,521
they be like,

3060
01:29:50,521 --> 01:29:51,780
what the fuck is going on?

3061
01:29:51,781 --> 01:29:51,991
I mean,

3062
01:29:51,991 --> 01:29:52,621
there was one point,

3063
01:29:52,621 --> 01:29:53,341
there's a little older,

3064
01:29:53,341 --> 01:29:54,240
like a black lady,

3065
01:29:54,241 --> 01:29:54,480
like,

3066
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,780
like pulled out a handkerchief and did
the old like patting her forehead with a

3067
01:29:57,781 --> 01:29:58,650
handkerchief.

3068
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:02,340
You're standing in front of strangers
and you're talking about throwing your

3069
01:30:02,341 --> 01:30:03,980
sperm on hotel walls.

3070
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:06,300
Meanwhile they're staying
in a hotel and they're like,

3071
01:30:06,430 --> 01:30:07,110
oh fuck.

3072
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:09,720
So they're not going back to the hotel.

3073
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:11,370
In my head I was doing that bit that,

3074
01:30:11,371 --> 01:30:11,840
you know,

3075
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:11,991
uh,

3076
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:13,470
about the two or the three pets.

3077
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:15,510
I have two cats and the dogs
and I'm thinking in my head,

3078
01:30:15,511 --> 01:30:15,691
all right,

3079
01:30:15,691 --> 01:30:16,740
this is a clean bit.

3080
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:19,070
You don't have to pop my cats
and dogs and stuff like that.

3081
01:30:19,071 --> 01:30:19,381
And I'm like,

3082
01:30:19,381 --> 01:30:19,711
wait,

3083
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:20,470
no it's not.

3084
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:21,420
And

3085
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:24,660
that's hilarious.

3086
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:26,280
Well that's a funny bit though.

3087
01:30:26,281 --> 01:30:27,540
They got to just relax.

3088
01:30:27,541 --> 01:30:28,680
Stop being silly bitches.

3089
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:29,550
They need to drink more.

3090
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:32,570
I've been hanging out downtown
a lot more trauma and it's,

3091
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:33,330
it's neat.

3092
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:34,620
Have you ever spent time,

3093
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:35,790
like a lot of time downtown,

3094
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:39,420
there's some of the best
restaurants in la or downtown,

3095
01:30:39,421 --> 01:30:41,430
so the best bars are in town,

3096
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:44,910
but what sucks is that it's
like bar cool restaurants,

3097
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:49,170
hot women and fancy people everywhere
and then one block over you're going to

3098
01:30:49,171 --> 01:30:50,210
get shot and killed it.

3099
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:51,840
Like it's just mixed up.

3100
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:56,280
So there's no like spread out
of like wealth and people.

3101
01:30:56,430 --> 01:30:59,610
It's just people mixed in like
not enough class structure for,

3102
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:00,513
you know,

3103
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:03,660
I don't like poor people running
around fucking up your fun.

3104
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:04,021
I mean,

3105
01:31:04,021 --> 01:31:04,950
not just poor people,

3106
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:06,810
like dangerous danger.

3107
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:09,290
What people don't know about downtown La.

3108
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:11,190
It sounds like what
Brian's saying is like,

3109
01:31:11,191 --> 01:31:11,351
well,

3110
01:31:11,351 --> 01:31:12,690
you don't want to be around poor people.

3111
01:31:12,990 --> 01:31:16,110
Downtown la has skid row and
if you haven't seen skid row,

3112
01:31:16,111 --> 01:31:16,950
it is real.

3113
01:31:17,370 --> 01:31:21,690
And skid row is a fucking
huge street that's filled.

3114
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:22,111
It's nice.

3115
01:31:22,111 --> 01:31:23,610
The streets like half downtown,

3116
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:24,990
every single block,

3117
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:25,830
every other block.

3118
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:26,041
Well,

3119
01:31:26,041 --> 01:31:27,570
there's one big area though.

3120
01:31:27,571 --> 01:31:29,120
There's one main area where it is a,

3121
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:30,230
it's a village of,

3122
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:31,090
of homeless people.

3123
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:32,013
It's incredible.

3124
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:32,431
I mean,

3125
01:31:32,431 --> 01:31:33,480
you'd never seen anything like it.

3126
01:31:33,481 --> 01:31:34,081
You're talking about,

3127
01:31:34,081 --> 01:31:35,160
you drive down the street,

3128
01:31:35,161 --> 01:31:38,880
there's hundreds if not thousands of
people and it's like a Zombie movie.

3129
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,020
It's really crazy.

3130
01:31:40,021 --> 01:31:40,341
Really.

3131
01:31:40,341 --> 01:31:41,410
It's like,

3132
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,850
I don't know if like there's areas where
they let them do this and they don't

3133
01:31:44,851 --> 01:31:45,660
fuck with them.

3134
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:48,150
And then there's like a place where
they can go get food that's nearby.

3135
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,430
And so like people were
camped out in front of that.

3136
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:50,841
Like it's,

3137
01:31:50,841 --> 01:31:51,150
it's,

3138
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:54,060
we did a lot of fear factor
down there and it's crazy.

3139
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:55,680
He's not exaggerating.

3140
01:31:55,681 --> 01:31:56,880
It's like it's something where you go,

3141
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:57,540
oh sure.

3142
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:58,170
No.

3143
01:31:58,170 --> 01:32:00,250
What fascinates me is if you looked

3144
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:03,970
at those people and if you look at the
people that are just complete fuck ups

3145
01:32:03,971 --> 01:32:05,710
and they just can't get
their shit together,

3146
01:32:05,711 --> 01:32:06,790
they're fucking losers.

3147
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:10,870
And you stop and think
about the possibility,

3148
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:11,480
the,

3149
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:11,721
the,

3150
01:32:11,721 --> 01:32:13,450
what humans can accomplish.

3151
01:32:13,690 --> 01:32:17,920
What a person who builds a nuclear reactor
can do with someone who's working at

3152
01:32:17,921 --> 01:32:18,550
cern.

3153
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:20,680
The large Hadron collider is capable of,

3154
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:25,270
they know the person who did the people
rather who designed fighter jets and

3155
01:32:25,271 --> 01:32:26,950
drones and the Internet.

3156
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:28,990
And then look at bumps and you go,

3157
01:32:28,991 --> 01:32:29,411
man,

3158
01:32:29,411 --> 01:32:30,250
people are weird.

3159
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,640
What a fucking strange
animal that vary so wildly.

3160
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,800
And yet these things are all surviving.

3161
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:39,850
Whereas if they were like [inaudible]
chickens didn't lay eggs or didn't know

3162
01:32:39,851 --> 01:32:40,750
how to eat with their face,

3163
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,250
they would be fucking dead.

3164
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:42,820
You know,

3165
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:43,360
they'd be,

3166
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,051
that'd be gone.

3167
01:32:44,051 --> 01:32:46,330
Every chicken is like
almost exactly the same.

3168
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:48,610
I mean they vary so slightly,

3169
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:49,930
but human beings,

3170
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:50,501
fuck,

3171
01:32:50,501 --> 01:32:55,501
we vary wildly in appearance and wildly
in our capabilities and our complements

3172
01:32:58,290 --> 01:33:01,210
and our adaptability to
our reality and are the,

3173
01:33:01,211 --> 01:33:03,550
are the environments that we
establish around ourselves,

3174
01:33:03,551 --> 01:33:03,880
the,

3175
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:04,100
the,

3176
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:04,290
the,

3177
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:06,760
the community that were just wildly,

3178
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:07,990
wildly different.

3179
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:11,980
And one of the arguments that I've heard
for the reasons for that is that human

3180
01:33:11,981 --> 01:33:16,330
beings are light dogs in that
they look totally different,

3181
01:33:16,331 --> 01:33:17,830
but they can breed with each other,

3182
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:19,260
which doesn't make sense and no,

3183
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:19,481
no.

3184
01:33:19,481 --> 01:33:20,410
They're part of the animal world.

3185
01:33:20,411 --> 01:33:22,090
Like an elk can't fuck a deer,

3186
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:22,930
you know,

3187
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:23,330
they,

3188
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:23,620
the main,

3189
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:24,453
he could,

3190
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,020
elk is run and shit.

3191
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:26,381
You know,

3192
01:33:26,381 --> 01:33:27,220
elks are huge.

3193
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:28,450
They want to fuck a deer.

3194
01:33:28,451 --> 01:33:28,960
They could,

3195
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,510
but it's not,

3196
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:30,700
nothing's going to come out of it.

3197
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:34,870
But shack can fuck Bridget damage it and
he could get her pregnant and they can

3198
01:33:34,871 --> 01:33:35,501
make a baby.

3199
01:33:35,501 --> 01:33:36,430
And that's legit.

3200
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:37,293
That's real.

3201
01:33:37,330 --> 01:33:39,820
That only exists in the dog world.

3202
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:42,880
And the reason why it exists
is because we engineered dogs.

3203
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:44,800
We made them out of one thing.

3204
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:46,300
Dogs used to all be wolves.

3205
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:48,100
We figured out somehow another,

3206
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,450
which by the way,

3207
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:52,030
if you pay attention to genetic
engineering of dogs or the,

3208
01:33:52,031 --> 01:33:52,930
or rather the,

3209
01:33:52,931 --> 01:33:53,130
uh,

3210
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:53,831
study of,

3211
01:33:53,831 --> 01:33:54,190
uh,

3212
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:54,600
the,

3213
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,800
the genetics of dogs,

3214
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:02,040
they think that all dogs somehow or
another came out of wolves and it happened

3215
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:04,660
more than 10,000 years ago.

3216
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:07,390
They don't know how the
fuck it was accomplished.

3217
01:34:07,630 --> 01:34:08,051
I mean,

3218
01:34:08,051 --> 01:34:13,000
dogs are one of the biggest mysteries
when you look at what is possible when you

3219
01:34:13,001 --> 01:34:15,100
take an animal and you turn
it into something else.

3220
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:17,240
The fact that up fucking chill.

3221
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:18,790
What came out of a wolf.

3222
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:21,820
Somehow they thought it was originally
they thought it was going to be a bunch

3223
01:34:21,821 --> 01:34:23,050
of wild candidates,

3224
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:25,450
a bunch of different kinds
of canines that were,

3225
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,060
that were created that
that's how a dog was created.

3226
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:29,950
And then there's all
kind of bread together.

3227
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:30,110
No,

3228
01:34:30,110 --> 01:34:30,250
no,

3229
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:30,410
no,

3230
01:34:30,410 --> 01:34:30,840
no,

3231
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:31,130
no,

3232
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:31,290
no,

3233
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:31,420
no,

3234
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:31,541
no,

3235
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:31,681
no,

3236
01:34:31,681 --> 01:34:31,821
no,

3237
01:34:31,821 --> 01:34:31,971
no,

3238
01:34:31,971 --> 01:34:32,121
no,

3239
01:34:32,121 --> 01:34:32,710
no,

3240
01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:33,760
no wolves.

3241
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:35,380
They all came from fucking wall.

3242
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:37,810
He can ease if I'm out both from a wolf,

3243
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,760
a fucking wolf.

3244
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:39,971
Yeah,

3245
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:40,151
no,

3246
01:34:40,151 --> 01:34:40,930
it's wild.

3247
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:42,310
Absolutely crazy.

3248
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:44,680
But that idea is that,

3249
01:34:44,681 --> 01:34:49,681
and for sure wolves rather turning into
dogs that was engineered by people we

3250
01:34:49,931 --> 01:34:50,410
made that,

3251
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:50,831
I mean they're,

3252
01:34:50,831 --> 01:34:52,350
they breed bulldogs.

3253
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:53,320
They do it on purpose.

3254
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:55,210
That is,

3255
01:34:55,211 --> 01:34:56,230
in my opinion,

3256
01:34:56,231 --> 01:35:01,231
one of the best pieces of support for
the idea that human beings may have been

3257
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:02,624
created,

3258
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:06,350
that human beings may have
been and said not a selection,

3259
01:35:06,351 --> 01:35:07,220
just due to,

3260
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:07,791
you know,

3261
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:10,400
a branching off in different climates,

3262
01:35:10,401 --> 01:35:11,181
established,

3263
01:35:11,181 --> 01:35:11,601
different,

3264
01:35:11,601 --> 01:35:12,050
you know,

3265
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:14,180
different types of people.

3266
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:15,230
Maybe not,

3267
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,273
maybe not.

3268
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:19,020
Maybe human beings were made.

3269
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,350
Maybe we were created and not just once,

3270
01:35:21,351 --> 01:35:22,184
maybe it was several.

3271
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:23,830
The ancient alien theory suggests,

3272
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:24,220
yeah,

3273
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:24,850
that's one of them.

3274
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:25,090
You know,

3275
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:28,420
the main tenants of the whole
idea bringing the dog thing.

3276
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:29,410
Uh,

3277
01:35:29,410 --> 01:35:33,130
we have brought it in not
with the dogs but for example,

3278
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:38,160
the leopard as an very interesting
genetic history where the leopard just

3279
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:42,160
basically appeared out of nowhere.

3280
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:43,000
Uh,

3281
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:43,750
and uh,

3282
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:46,360
what's fascinating to me is
that if we look at our history,

3283
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:46,990
uh,

3284
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:48,100
genetically speaking,

3285
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:48,840
you know,

3286
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:51,580
in any other species,

3287
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:55,000
if a species reaches a certain point,

3288
01:35:55,001 --> 01:35:59,380
what a population dwindles down to
such low numbers and there isn't enough

3289
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,720
genetic material available in the,

3290
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:02,680
in the gene pool,

3291
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:06,940
then that species has reached
a stadium that's called,

3292
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:08,170
um,

3293
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:12,160
the genetic bottleneck stadium
where the genetic bottleneck effect,

3294
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:16,000
meaning that if that should
happen to any species,

3295
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:19,600
then they are 100% guaranteed to die out.

3296
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:20,770
So like an inbred dog.

3297
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:21,631
Exactly.

3298
01:36:21,631 --> 01:36:22,260
We've all seen in,

3299
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:25,000
but I have a friend who has an inbred
dog and she doesn't want to admit it or

3300
01:36:25,001 --> 01:36:27,070
fucking dogs eyes are that
far apart from each other.

3301
01:36:27,071 --> 01:36:28,300
Dog is stupid as shit.

3302
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:28,901
And I go,

3303
01:36:28,901 --> 01:36:29,681
where did you get this dog?

3304
01:36:29,681 --> 01:36:30,790
She goes like a breeder,

3305
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:31,810
one of the top breeders,

3306
01:36:31,811 --> 01:36:32,461
my top readers,

3307
01:36:32,461 --> 01:36:33,294
that dog,

3308
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:35,190
that dog is brother fucked.

3309
01:36:35,191 --> 01:36:36,180
It's sister fucked.

3310
01:36:36,181 --> 01:36:37,014
It's baby fuck.

3311
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:37,511
That is,

3312
01:36:37,511 --> 01:36:38,940
this is a terrible English.

3313
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:40,470
And what's crazy is that,

3314
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:41,791
like I said,

3315
01:36:41,791 --> 01:36:43,410
it's a mathematical certainty.

3316
01:36:43,411 --> 01:36:46,850
If I would species reaches that
stadium and anybody can go look,

3317
01:36:46,851 --> 01:36:48,870
does online is not something
that I came up with.

3318
01:36:49,110 --> 01:36:50,400
They die out period.

3319
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:54,600
Right now there's one species on planet
earth that has gone through two genetic

3320
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:55,434
bottlenecks.

3321
01:36:56,190 --> 01:36:57,270
US human beings.

3322
01:36:57,570 --> 01:36:58,830
How the hell did we survive?

3323
01:36:58,831 --> 01:36:59,281
How do they know?

3324
01:36:59,281 --> 01:37:03,030
We went through two genetic bottleneck
geneticists or have have researched it

3325
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:04,560
and it's geneticists that have,

3326
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:05,130
uh,

3327
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:08,880
found the evidence for that apparently
in Europe and it's been corroborated here

3328
01:37:08,881 --> 01:37:09,714
in the states.

3329
01:37:09,810 --> 01:37:10,350
So,

3330
01:37:10,350 --> 01:37:10,681
so,

3331
01:37:10,681 --> 01:37:10,921
you know,

3332
01:37:10,921 --> 01:37:11,620
to think about,

3333
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:16,080
and this is why I'm saying that
these two stages where that happened,

3334
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:21,340
there's no way we could have survived
without the guarantee by extraterrestrials

3335
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:22,590
that they ensured our survival,

3336
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:23,573
our breeders.

3337
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:24,300
Yes.

3338
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:26,610
We don't want to accept that
idea as they're called in,

3339
01:37:26,611 --> 01:37:26,941
in,

3340
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:27,140
uh,

3341
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:28,320
prometheus's the engineer's.

3342
01:37:28,350 --> 01:37:28,561
Yeah.

3343
01:37:28,561 --> 01:37:28,890
Yeah,

3344
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:30,300
we don't unaccept that idea,

3345
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:35,100
but yet we do accept the idea that things
will continue to improve of course,

3346
01:37:35,190 --> 01:37:39,630
but that does gotta mean
it's going to go somewhere.

3347
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:42,390
And so how do we know it hasn't
already gone somewhere somewhere else?

3348
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:43,423
Should I know,

3349
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:48,830
to me there's much more evidence
that we are arrogant and that we,

3350
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:49,411
uh,

3351
01:37:49,411 --> 01:37:49,651
you know,

3352
01:37:49,651 --> 01:37:50,461
in the name of,

3353
01:37:50,461 --> 01:37:55,170
of science and calling things science
and academia that we are refusing,

3354
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:56,010
look at

3355
01:37:56,010 --> 01:38:00,090
the reality that this whole
thing is a crazy mystery.

3356
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:04,800
And that although there are some things
that science has a absolutely 100%

3357
01:38:04,801 --> 01:38:07,610
proved and these are fascinating things
and they should be credited for it and

3358
01:38:07,611 --> 01:38:08,221
thought scientists,

3359
01:38:08,221 --> 01:38:08,680
amazing.

3360
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:09,630
And don't get me wrong,

3361
01:38:09,631 --> 01:38:10,464
that's not what I'm saying.

3362
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:14,070
But what I am saying is everyone
is a little bit fucking cocky.

3363
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:18,810
And when you got to be sure 1000
stone ton stones laying around,

3364
01:38:18,990 --> 01:38:23,310
and when you got all these people that
existed thousands of years ago drawing

3365
01:38:23,311 --> 01:38:24,450
shit on cave walls,

3366
01:38:24,451 --> 01:38:27,270
it looked like fucking
aliens and spaceships.

3367
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:31,980
And then these people who were really
classic artists who actually could draw

3368
01:38:31,981 --> 01:38:36,981
what they were seeing and had people
and seated positions with rocket ships

3369
01:38:37,081 --> 01:38:40,950
flying through the background
of a classical like,

3370
01:38:40,951 --> 01:38:41,191
I mean,

3371
01:38:41,191 --> 01:38:45,450
it looks like a Victorian era painting
and they have people flying around in the

3372
01:38:45,451 --> 01:38:46,284
fucking air.

3373
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,333
Like what do they,

3374
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:48,540
what do they depicting?

3375
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:49,850
No end what we're saying.

3376
01:38:49,851 --> 01:38:51,300
Or not us of course,

3377
01:38:51,301 --> 01:38:55,500
but the mainstream archaeologists that
that was nothing else but a figment of

3378
01:38:55,501 --> 01:39:00,150
our ancestors imagination that they had
to put something on the walls in order

3379
01:39:00,151 --> 01:39:01,500
to make sense of nature.

3380
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:06,890
Now what an insulting statement is that
because our ancestors were a people of

3381
01:39:07,651 --> 01:39:08,430
nature,

3382
01:39:08,430 --> 01:39:10,200
they were so familiar with nature,

3383
01:39:10,201 --> 01:39:14,820
you couldn't even fathom how much
they were in touch with nature.

3384
01:39:14,821 --> 01:39:17,340
So to say that they had to,

3385
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:18,090
you know,

3386
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:21,090
make sure to make shit up in
order to make sense of nature,

3387
01:39:21,091 --> 01:39:23,190
in my opinion is total bull shit.

3388
01:39:23,191 --> 01:39:23,461
Okay,

3389
01:39:23,461 --> 01:39:24,600
I got one word for you then.

3390
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:25,673
Ready?

3391
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:27,150
Tell me dragons.

3392
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:30,300
Dragons is the fuck dragons.

3393
01:39:30,301 --> 01:39:30,680
Uh,

3394
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:30,961
you know,

3395
01:39:30,961 --> 01:39:31,231
that's,

3396
01:39:31,231 --> 01:39:33,330
that's another thing that
I'll be addressing tonight.

3397
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:34,310
My,

3398
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:34,760
my,

3399
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:35,593
Oh yeah,

3400
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:38,280
let's everybody let everybody
know about that because that is a,

3401
01:39:38,281 --> 01:39:39,930
if you want to see Giorgio in person,

3402
01:39:39,931 --> 01:39:41,490
you could touch his hair tonight,

3403
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:42,720
tonight,

3404
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:43,260
tonight.

3405
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:47,130
Los Angeles here in Hollywood
at the Universal Sheraton.

3406
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:51,750
Everybody should come out and it's at
7:00 PM it starts and it's a long ass

3407
01:39:51,751 --> 01:39:52,111
lecture,

3408
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:52,440
right?

3409
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:52,651
Yeah,

3410
01:39:52,651 --> 01:39:52,891
it's a,

3411
01:39:52,891 --> 01:39:53,581
it's a two hour,

3412
01:39:53,581 --> 01:39:55,500
two and a half hour
presentation with Q and.

3413
01:39:55,501 --> 01:39:56,250
A.

3414
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:57,390
We're going to take pictures,

3415
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:59,070
audit autographs afterwards.

3416
01:39:59,071 --> 01:40:00,180
I will show folks,

3417
01:40:00,181 --> 01:40:00,930
this is what you do,

3418
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:01,471
everybody.

3419
01:40:01,471 --> 01:40:04,050
You got to flood this place
and every time in the Q and a,

3420
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:06,420
I want to be ready.

3421
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:08,550
I was really going to ask
olive garden questions.

3422
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:10,740
Imagine it was,

3423
01:40:10,741 --> 01:40:14,480
the whole show is just assholes from
this asking about all of gardens.

3424
01:40:14,481 --> 01:40:14,931
A drag.

3425
01:40:14,931 --> 01:40:15,510
I would love it.

3426
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:18,480
The dragon dragons are not a fig
Newton of your immigration or

3427
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:22,591
no,

3428
01:40:22,591 --> 01:40:23,130
they're not.

3429
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:23,311
No,

3430
01:40:23,311 --> 01:40:24,900
no fig Newton enough.

3431
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:25,621
Your immigration.

3432
01:40:25,621 --> 01:40:26,454
I love that.

3433
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:27,271
That's a good one.

3434
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:28,440
It's hilarious that in the future,

3435
01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:29,580
um,

3436
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:30,590
the nose like that upper is,

3437
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,390
I go saying that Shit Bro.

3438
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:33,270
Yeah,

3439
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:34,080
that's a good one.

3440
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:34,913
Um,

3441
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:35,281
no,

3442
01:40:35,281 --> 01:40:39,090
but the thing is we have to ask ourselves
with this idea of dragons come from,

3443
01:40:39,091 --> 01:40:40,740
because our ancestors were very,

3444
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:41,520
uh,

3445
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:41,911
like I said,

3446
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:46,530
in touch with nature and for them to come
up with a story like dragons is quite

3447
01:40:46,531 --> 01:40:50,880
bizarre to me because in many
occasions of these stories,

3448
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:51,990
uh,

3449
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:56,990
those dragons have always been
brought into a comparison with fire,

3450
01:40:57,351 --> 01:40:59,050
smoke and a lot of noise.

3451
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:01,450
And exactly.

3452
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:06,160
And because I say rocket ships or you
say rocket ships and I agree with you

3453
01:41:06,161 --> 01:41:10,180
because whenever these
dragons quote unquote landed,

3454
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:15,190
the belly would open up and the gods
would walk out of those dragons.

3455
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:17,830
So if a dragon and every culture,

3456
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:18,821
most,

3457
01:41:18,821 --> 01:41:19,210
yes,

3458
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:22,690
most every in in India
we have Garuda and uh,

3459
01:41:22,691 --> 01:41:23,220
you know,

3460
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:24,670
the Vimana into vimanas.

3461
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:28,030
And then in China and in
Japan we have to dragons.

3462
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:29,710
But most of the times,

3463
01:41:29,711 --> 01:41:30,820
and also in the Middle Ages,

3464
01:41:30,821 --> 01:41:32,530
in some of the European countries,

3465
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:33,610
um,

3466
01:41:33,610 --> 01:41:37,000
we have these stories where the bellies
would open up and that's where the gods

3467
01:41:37,001 --> 01:41:37,834
would walk out of.

3468
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:38,650
And guns,

3469
01:41:38,650 --> 01:41:39,371
as we all know,

3470
01:41:39,371 --> 01:41:41,800
lower case g has nothing
to do with the university,

3471
01:41:41,801 --> 01:41:42,634
Yada Yada.

3472
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:43,391
So just,

3473
01:41:43,391 --> 01:41:43,661
you know,

3474
01:41:43,661 --> 01:41:46,930
cause gods do not exist
the way it's also our,

3475
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:48,550
our term for these things.

3476
01:41:48,551 --> 01:41:49,384
Like when you,

3477
01:41:49,890 --> 01:41:52,630
when you were transcribing
Sumerian culture,

3478
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:54,850
when you're transcribing their languages,

3479
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:58,270
it's like there's a lot of
it that is very abstract.

3480
01:41:58,271 --> 01:42:00,970
It's very hard to wrap your head
around exactly what they're saying.

3481
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:03,520
And there's a lot of translations
that are really weird.

3482
01:42:03,521 --> 01:42:05,890
So the word God in our eyes,

3483
01:42:05,891 --> 01:42:06,041
you know,

3484
01:42:06,041 --> 01:42:07,120
we're saying it's a god,

3485
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:08,350
we're saying that this is a god,

3486
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,390
but it's very possible that their,

3487
01:42:10,391 --> 01:42:11,950
their word was a different word,

3488
01:42:11,951 --> 01:42:12,231
like the,

3489
01:42:12,231 --> 01:42:13,300
the Nephilim.

3490
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:13,601
Sure.

3491
01:42:13,601 --> 01:42:13,901
You know,

3492
01:42:13,901 --> 01:42:15,550
people look at the Nephilim and they,

3493
01:42:15,551 --> 01:42:15,761
they,

3494
01:42:15,761 --> 01:42:16,011
they,

3495
01:42:16,011 --> 01:42:16,800
they believe,

3496
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:16,930
well,

3497
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:17,411
what did it mean?

3498
01:42:17,411 --> 01:42:17,791
What is the,

3499
01:42:17,791 --> 01:42:18,730
the actual,

3500
01:42:19,450 --> 01:42:22,990
like if you wanted to talk to
a mainstream biblical scholar,

3501
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:24,490
what would they say?

3502
01:42:24,491 --> 01:42:27,910
The nephilim is supposed to
represent the fallen angels,

3503
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:28,840
fallen angels,

3504
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:30,820
and they will pretty much,

3505
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:34,570
that was the way to get away with
inhabiting other gods other than God.

3506
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:34,931
Well No.

3507
01:42:34,931 --> 01:42:37,390
And they were kind of like God's angels.

3508
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:37,601
Yeah,

3509
01:42:37,601 --> 01:42:38,010
there's soup.

3510
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:38,210
Well,

3511
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:39,043
solar dope.

3512
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:43,210
They were messengers between
the gods and human beings.

3513
01:42:43,211 --> 01:42:47,830
And they weren't angels the way
we would think of angels today,

3514
01:42:47,831 --> 01:42:50,380
that they're these ethereal
beings that are invisible.

3515
01:42:50,381 --> 01:42:50,980
And you know,

3516
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:53,920
there's a good one sitting on your left
shoulder and a bad one on your right

3517
01:42:53,921 --> 01:42:55,240
shoulder and things like that.

3518
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:57,200
So it's a,

3519
01:42:57,220 --> 01:42:58,090
you know,

3520
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:02,920
angels also have never been depicted
with wings until fairly later.

3521
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,053
The,

3522
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:05,351
from,

3523
01:43:05,351 --> 01:43:06,760
from the first times angels,

3524
01:43:06,761 --> 01:43:07,630
wherever even,

3525
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:08,310
uh,

3526
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:10,870
described or the word angel even came up.

3527
01:43:10,871 --> 01:43:11,170
I mean,

3528
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:13,870
Angel comes from the Greek
word of Anglos basic,

3529
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:16,210
which means middleman or messenger.

3530
01:43:16,330 --> 01:43:17,163
Holy Shit.

3531
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:17,831
You know.

3532
01:43:17,831 --> 01:43:22,290
So if we look at the electric we did
that we need role do tongue on gallows.

3533
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:23,800
Angulo suppose a check.

3534
01:43:23,801 --> 01:43:24,400
I'd be very,

3535
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,280
very turned on by that formula.

3536
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:32,260
So nationally and you know,

3537
01:43:32,261 --> 01:43:32,710
so,

3538
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:33,640
so the thing is that,

3539
01:43:33,641 --> 01:43:34,000
you know,

3540
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,830
the wings were only added later,

3541
01:43:35,831 --> 01:43:36,910
but why were they added it?

3542
01:43:36,911 --> 01:43:41,911
Because those messengers that were in
touch with those gods had the capability

3543
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:44,710
of flight and that
flight never took place.

3544
01:43:44,711 --> 01:43:49,090
We stupid wings by it took place with
some type of a technological machine.

3545
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:50,860
And of course that is,

3546
01:43:50,861 --> 01:43:51,141
you know,

3547
01:43:51,141 --> 01:43:52,460
subscribing to the engineering

3548
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:52,970
theory.

3549
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:53,230
Chess,

3550
01:43:53,230 --> 01:43:54,170
some other people.

3551
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:54,690
Yes.

3552
01:43:54,690 --> 01:43:58,170
Jetpacks now you watch that or if you um,

3553
01:43:58,730 --> 01:44:00,020
don't know if you have seen this,

3554
01:44:00,021 --> 01:44:02,810
these youtube clips of this
dude that has his rocket pack.

3555
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:03,290
Oh yeah.

3556
01:44:03,290 --> 01:44:07,520
But it's attached to the water with a
long tube and it water shoots out of his

3557
01:44:07,521 --> 01:44:08,121
rocket pack.

3558
01:44:08,121 --> 01:44:09,140
And so he can be,

3559
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,273
you know,

3560
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:13,640
flying around on that thing for hours.

3561
01:44:13,641 --> 01:44:15,850
And if you look at that white water,

3562
01:44:15,851 --> 01:44:18,800
that ejection of that
Whitewater looks like wings,

3563
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:21,860
even though it's technology
and he looks at things,

3564
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:24,980
it looked like aliens are not going
to use that stupid water thing.

3565
01:44:25,070 --> 01:44:25,903
No.

3566
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:26,990
What I'm,

3567
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:30,020
my argument is that if
somebody watches this,

3568
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:32,990
Ryan found having a
technological frame of reference,

3569
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:36,710
then they won't know that what
they're looking at is a jet pack.

3570
01:44:36,711 --> 01:44:38,360
They will think it's something divine.

3571
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:40,670
Well not only that is
misunderstood technology.

3572
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:41,331
Not only that,

3573
01:44:41,331 --> 01:44:46,331
but most likely every single depiction
of any of these events was told as a

3574
01:44:47,631 --> 01:44:52,340
spoken word sort of a thing for a
thousand years before it was ever written.

3575
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:53,211
Exactly.

3576
01:44:53,211 --> 01:44:53,921
So when you,

3577
01:44:53,921 --> 01:44:56,600
you talk about the depictions
in the Bible you are,

3578
01:44:56,601 --> 01:45:01,250
you are already talking about some really
ancient shit anti and the Bible is not

3579
01:45:01,251 --> 01:45:01,880
even an owner,

3580
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:02,870
an original work.

3581
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:06,680
There have been at least six other books,

3582
01:45:06,710 --> 01:45:10,970
holy sacred books that were found before
the Bible that also tell if a flood

3583
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:11,690
story.

3584
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:14,630
So the Bible is not the first sacred book.

3585
01:45:14,631 --> 01:45:15,051
In fact,

3586
01:45:15,051 --> 01:45:16,220
it's a very young book.

3587
01:45:16,221 --> 01:45:19,580
There are other books that go back to
6,000 years especially talking about the

3588
01:45:19,581 --> 01:45:20,390
new testament.

3589
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:21,140
Exactly.

3590
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:24,410
Oh literally know the people
who chose what's in it,

3591
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:27,980
Constantine and all these bishops and
they put it together and the council of

3592
01:45:27,981 --> 01:45:30,590
Nicea and there was some shit
they even left out like they were.

3593
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:31,550
So those are called,

3594
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:33,800
those are called the
epoc and the Apocrypha,

3595
01:45:33,801 --> 01:45:34,750
the apocryphal texts.

3596
01:45:34,751 --> 01:45:37,760
It would have forbidden books
of the Bible where for example,

3597
01:45:37,761 --> 01:45:42,761
you have the apocalypse of Abraham in
which Abrahams ascension into code and

3598
01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:44,480
code heaviness described.

3599
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:47,330
But if you look at it from
a modern day perspective,

3600
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:52,500
what we can read their reads as if he
is entering some type of a spaceship.

3601
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:58,460
He's taken up there and then he is
boarding some type of an orbiting space

3602
01:45:58,461 --> 01:45:59,000
station.

3603
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,230
And guys,

3604
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:05,320
I know that this sounds apps
so lutely bat shit crazy,

3605
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:09,140
but the questions remain.

3606
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:12,890
How did our ancestors
describe something like this?

3607
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:15,860
That if you look at it from
a modern day perspective,

3608
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:18,590
it reminds of a trip to space,

3609
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:18,921
right?

3610
01:46:18,921 --> 01:46:22,100
And why is it that all
these gods exist in the sky?

3611
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:23,570
How come these gods,

3612
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:26,200
I mean this is Gabriel or,

3613
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,051
or rather,

3614
01:46:27,051 --> 01:46:27,440
um,

3615
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:27,711
who,

3616
01:46:27,711 --> 01:46:29,690
who is Satan was Satan Lucifer.

3617
01:46:29,691 --> 01:46:33,680
Lucifer was as original Denise Lucifer.

3618
01:46:33,681 --> 01:46:36,110
That was what he was [inaudible]
and that means bringer of light.

3619
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:40,010
And only then he was turning to Satan
or into something evil because he was

3620
01:46:40,011 --> 01:46:40,581
outcast.

3621
01:46:40,581 --> 01:46:44,390
And I in the ancient alien
theory proposes that,

3622
01:46:44,391 --> 01:46:44,800
uh,

3623
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,130
what we have here is a huge misconception
that this has had never anything to do

3624
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,070
with the devil

3625
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:50,670
or within,

3626
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:50,791
well,

3627
01:46:50,791 --> 01:46:51,001
you know,

3628
01:46:51,001 --> 01:46:52,800
fighting God or God fighting the devil,

3629
01:46:53,190 --> 01:46:56,970
but that there might have been a
mutiny on some type of a spaceship and,

3630
01:46:56,971 --> 01:46:57,271
uh,

3631
01:46:57,271 --> 01:46:57,631
you know,

3632
01:46:57,631 --> 01:46:59,910
they were cast off not because they were,

3633
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:00,691
uh,

3634
01:47:00,691 --> 01:47:01,524
you know,

3635
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:02,311
Satan's,

3636
01:47:02,311 --> 01:47:03,420
but because they were,

3637
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:03,701
you know,

3638
01:47:03,701 --> 01:47:05,970
we get along mute mutineers you know,

3639
01:47:05,971 --> 01:47:09,090
because there were no angels back then.

3640
01:47:09,091 --> 01:47:10,020
There were no,

3641
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:10,831
there was no,

3642
01:47:10,831 --> 01:47:13,890
there was no thing
between God and to devil.

3643
01:47:13,891 --> 01:47:18,000
It's all a total misconception
of a total misunderstood visit.

3644
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:18,780
So they were like,

3645
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:21,480
not extra terrestrials like
the devil's were like Nazis,

3646
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:22,433
like the enemy.

3647
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:25,450
Like if you were going to
have like someone who is your,

3648
01:47:25,451 --> 01:47:26,101
your enemy,

3649
01:47:26,101 --> 01:47:28,170
if somebody broke off and
you want to describe it,

3650
01:47:28,171 --> 01:47:29,160
those are the evil people.

3651
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:29,850
I mean,

3652
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:30,810
you could create,

3653
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:31,590
they were still,

3654
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:32,520
they were still at the same,

3655
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:34,260
the idea that was proposed,

3656
01:47:34,261 --> 01:47:34,800
was it theirs?

3657
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,050
They were still part of the same crew.

3658
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:38,041
And then,

3659
01:47:38,041 --> 01:47:38,401
you know,

3660
01:47:38,401 --> 01:47:38,941
just like,

3661
01:47:38,941 --> 01:47:39,210
uh,

3662
01:47:39,210 --> 01:47:41,010
during a pirate days and stuff like that,

3663
01:47:41,011 --> 01:47:43,170
they would be mutinies going on back then.

3664
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,480
Well maybe that's why you
can start off on an island.

3665
01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:47,520
You burn forever cause they
nuked the shit out of you.

3666
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:48,420
Maybe that's what it is.

3667
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:49,253
Well yeah,

3668
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:50,370
exactly.

3669
01:47:50,371 --> 01:47:51,990
You have to ask yourself the question,

3670
01:47:51,991 --> 01:47:55,860
where did the ideas for heaven and
hell even come from the whole fire and

3671
01:47:55,861 --> 01:47:56,730
brimstone thing?

3672
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:59,400
And if you look at the
orange origins of that,

3673
01:47:59,430 --> 01:47:59,821
you know,

3674
01:47:59,821 --> 01:48:02,310
it all came because of flank furnaces,

3675
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,270
flank furnaces.

3676
01:48:03,271 --> 01:48:03,901
Are you kidding me?

3677
01:48:03,901 --> 01:48:04,734
What was that?

3678
01:48:04,830 --> 01:48:05,260
Couldn't be.

3679
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:05,490
There's,

3680
01:48:05,490 --> 01:48:06,300
we're not idiots.

3681
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:07,320
Supervolcanoes yeah.

3682
01:48:07,321 --> 01:48:08,920
Well what about that?

3683
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:09,900
I mean if you looked at that,

3684
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:11,550
if you looked inside a volcano,

3685
01:48:11,551 --> 01:48:12,510
you'd think that's hell,

3686
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:13,493
that's the center.

3687
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:16,360
But a supervolcano doesn't
take off or fly away.

3688
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:16,920
That's true.

3689
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:17,191
You know,

3690
01:48:17,191 --> 01:48:17,791
so that's why,

3691
01:48:17,791 --> 01:48:17,971
you know,

3692
01:48:17,971 --> 01:48:20,670
the flank furnaces think to me is
very fascinating because they were,

3693
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:22,500
they were familiar with furnaces,

3694
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,990
but they knew as much as anybody,

3695
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:26,250
furnaces don't fly.

3696
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,160
And all of a sudden we have
flying furnaces that are,

3697
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,840
were bigger and made noise.

3698
01:48:30,841 --> 01:48:31,261
And you know,

3699
01:48:31,261 --> 01:48:33,930
the earth trembled and dust
and smoke and craziness.

3700
01:48:34,230 --> 01:48:35,063
So you know,

3701
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,230
they didn't have the vocabulary.

3702
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:38,310
What are these descriptions?

3703
01:48:38,311 --> 01:48:38,431
Yeah,

3704
01:48:38,431 --> 01:48:40,140
what are these descriptions of explaining?

3705
01:48:40,141 --> 01:48:40,501
It is a,

3706
01:48:40,501 --> 01:48:45,501
is a very tricky thing and it's
real easy for people to just go pop,

3707
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:48,570
what is this fucking Ufo nonsense?

3708
01:48:48,571 --> 01:48:50,550
What the fuck are these
people talking about?

3709
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:53,970
But if you really just stopped
and thought about it for a sec,

3710
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,990
if something did happen ten thousand
twelve thousand thirty thousand years ago

3711
01:48:58,991 --> 01:48:59,824
or whatever the fuck it was,

3712
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:02,370
how much do you think would be around?

3713
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:04,140
How much evidence would that is?

3714
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:07,230
That is a wonderful question
because a lot of times they're like,

3715
01:49:07,231 --> 01:49:07,411
you know,

3716
01:49:07,411 --> 01:49:10,410
how come we've never found
a remnant of a machine?

3717
01:49:10,411 --> 01:49:12,480
Or how come we've never
found a crashed spaceship?

3718
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:13,830
Because first of all,

3719
01:49:14,190 --> 01:49:19,140
if it's a technological device and it's
left out in the open on your phone,

3720
01:49:19,141 --> 01:49:19,861
I can find my phone.

3721
01:49:19,861 --> 01:49:20,341
If I lose it,

3722
01:49:20,341 --> 01:49:21,320
you can't find your spaceship.

3723
01:49:21,650 --> 01:49:22,310
Yeah.

3724
01:49:22,310 --> 01:49:22,530
You know,

3725
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:24,480
but you need out there for 12,000 years,

3726
01:49:24,481 --> 01:49:26,940
it will disintegrate into dust number one.

3727
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:28,860
So it depends on where it was stored.

3728
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:30,090
But at the same time,

3729
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:30,451
you know,

3730
01:49:30,451 --> 01:49:33,900
when was the last time you saw a
construction site and after they finished

3731
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:35,010
building everything,

3732
01:49:35,011 --> 01:49:38,460
you walk in there and all the construction
materials and the construction tools

3733
01:49:38,610 --> 01:49:39,443
are still there.

3734
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:40,950
People that build stuff,

3735
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:44,790
they bring their tools and then when they
leave they take their tools with them.

3736
01:49:45,090 --> 01:49:47,010
And I think that that was the same,

3737
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:50,530
those extra terrestrials from thousands
of years ago that those tools were

3738
01:49:50,531 --> 01:49:51,550
extremely valuable.

3739
01:49:51,551 --> 01:49:53,890
So they had an inventory and they said,

3740
01:49:53,891 --> 01:49:54,400
you know,

3741
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:55,350
machine x,

3742
01:49:55,351 --> 01:49:55,441
y,

3743
01:49:55,441 --> 01:49:56,274
Z is missing.

3744
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:57,153
Go find it.

3745
01:49:57,700 --> 01:49:58,840
So they hook people up,

3746
01:49:58,870 --> 01:49:59,740
they let them use a machine.

3747
01:49:59,741 --> 01:50:00,130
Yes,

3748
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:01,270
they build this shit and they all right,

3749
01:50:01,271 --> 01:50:01,990
we're out of here.

3750
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:02,823
Right.

3751
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:04,510
That would explain a lot of things.

3752
01:50:04,690 --> 01:50:06,880
One of the things that
would explain is in this,

3753
01:50:06,881 --> 01:50:07,540
again,

3754
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:08,350
this is real,

3755
01:50:08,350 --> 01:50:13,350
there are certain pieces of construction
that we really have no idea how to like

3756
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:16,150
they did like the h block
that you have right there.

3757
01:50:16,180 --> 01:50:18,220
And how many of these blocks are in Puma?

3758
01:50:18,221 --> 01:50:18,890
Pimco,

3759
01:50:18,890 --> 01:50:19,900
the h blocks,

3760
01:50:19,970 --> 01:50:20,420
uh,

3761
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:25,420
I think either 13 or 17 have been found
and archeologists are at the moment

3762
01:50:25,931 --> 01:50:29,950
trying to reassemble Puma Punko to
its former glory because right now,

3763
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:30,791
and by the way,

3764
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:33,090
if somebody really or in three d graph,

3765
01:50:33,091 --> 01:50:34,510
so literally ambien.

3766
01:50:34,530 --> 01:50:36,160
And the unfortunate thing is,

3767
01:50:36,161 --> 01:50:37,060
and I've seen pictures,

3768
01:50:37,061 --> 01:50:37,990
I haven't been there lately,

3769
01:50:37,991 --> 01:50:42,991
but I've seen pictures through who were
sent to me by friends and the blocks are

3770
01:50:43,301 --> 01:50:46,720
being put together completely
in the wrong places.

3771
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:48,140
Why are they moving blocks?

3772
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:49,013
Well,

3773
01:50:49,150 --> 01:50:51,490
some blocks have disappeared Joe.

3774
01:50:51,670 --> 01:50:52,750
Someone stole blocks.

3775
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:53,111
No,

3776
01:50:53,111 --> 01:50:55,290
actually I think that they used to a,

3777
01:50:55,330 --> 01:50:56,163
um,

3778
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,750
what do you call these hammers
that you use out in the street?

3779
01:50:58,880 --> 01:50:59,560
Jack Hammer.

3780
01:50:59,560 --> 01:50:59,930
Jackhammer.

3781
01:50:59,930 --> 01:51:00,810
So use jackhammers.

3782
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:04,510
And they basically just disintegrated
some of these blocks because they didn't

3783
01:51:04,511 --> 01:51:06,610
fit into the scheme what
they're trying to do.

3784
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:10,780
And it seems as if some of these
professors or scientists have never played

3785
01:51:10,781 --> 01:51:13,750
lego's a treacherous tetris
in their entire lives.

3786
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:14,321
Wait a minute,

3787
01:51:14,321 --> 01:51:14,680
wait a minute.

3788
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:16,320
What a dumb idea to modes.

3789
01:51:16,350 --> 01:51:16,601
Horse.

3790
01:51:16,601 --> 01:51:17,211
A sensor.

3791
01:51:17,211 --> 01:51:18,044
Chabot,

3792
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:18,331
but,

3793
01:51:18,331 --> 01:51:18,550
well,

3794
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:21,550
it's so stupid because it's
going to confuse our ancestors.

3795
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:21,941
Well,

3796
01:51:21,941 --> 01:51:22,301
excuse me,

3797
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:23,410
our predecessor thing,

3798
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:24,760
our heirs,

3799
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:25,331
our heirs.

3800
01:51:25,331 --> 01:51:25,600
Yeah.

3801
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:26,381
Well the thing is that,

3802
01:51:26,381 --> 01:51:27,214
you know,

3803
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:30,140
predecessor tunecore's to
steal the foma Puente cu.

3804
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:30,470
Dot.

3805
01:51:30,470 --> 01:51:33,100
Mine is a place that is in ruins.

3806
01:51:33,130 --> 01:51:34,090
It's not,

3807
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:35,350
it's not like a clear,

3808
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:36,341
exactly.

3809
01:51:36,341 --> 01:51:39,670
So then of course you also have to
have to ask yourself the question,

3810
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:41,290
how the hell was it destroyed?

3811
01:51:41,470 --> 01:51:43,420
How did he get into this stage?

3812
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:46,090
Unless they must've been
some deliberate destruction.

3813
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:46,451
Well,

3814
01:51:46,451 --> 01:51:47,830
for a giant,

3815
01:51:49,330 --> 01:51:51,400
giant cataclysmic event,

3816
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:52,353
who knows?

3817
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:53,200
It could have been easily.

3818
01:51:53,201 --> 01:51:57,130
And maybe that also
explains why at 12,000 feet,

3819
01:51:57,131 --> 01:51:59,770
maybe the environment was different
because one of the things that they're

3820
01:51:59,771 --> 01:52:04,771
saying about the pre dinosaur era and
one of the reasons why they think that

3821
01:52:05,411 --> 01:52:08,880
animals may have been so large back
then and so much different than they are

3822
01:52:08,881 --> 01:52:09,610
today,

3823
01:52:09,610 --> 01:52:14,290
is that the actual atmosphere may have
been different then than it is today.

3824
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:15,940
And the impact in,

3825
01:52:15,941 --> 01:52:16,774
uh,

3826
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:17,051
the,

3827
01:52:17,051 --> 01:52:17,590
uh,

3828
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:20,830
the Yucatan that they believe
happened 65 billion years ago,

3829
01:52:20,831 --> 01:52:22,540
that killed off everything.

3830
01:52:22,541 --> 01:52:23,430
And then from there,

3831
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:25,060
flowering plants emerged.

3832
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:25,451
And you know,

3833
01:52:25,451 --> 01:52:29,230
the emergence of mammals
is as the higher intellect.

3834
01:52:29,231 --> 01:52:31,180
And dominant part of the food chain.

3835
01:52:31,330 --> 01:52:33,100
But before all that
they'd thinking that the,

3836
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:34,780
the environment might have been different.

3837
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:36,070
And if that is the case,

3838
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:38,500
maybe a at 12,000 feet,

3839
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:38,831
you know,

3840
01:52:38,831 --> 01:52:41,320
a long fucking time ago there
was more oxygen up there.

3841
01:52:41,321 --> 01:52:42,850
Maybe it was a different wash here.

3842
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:43,900
Here's the thing that,

3843
01:52:43,901 --> 01:52:44,141
you know,

3844
01:52:44,141 --> 01:52:49,141
some people have that that entire Indian
plateau of the Bolivian highlands was

3845
01:52:51,021 --> 01:52:54,980
at one point way lower
than it currently is.

3846
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:59,330
And if that is the case then you
have to ask yourself the question,

3847
01:52:59,331 --> 01:53:01,130
when was that in number two?

3848
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,370
All around this entire plateau up there,

3849
01:53:04,990 --> 01:53:08,960
you find fossils of a saltwater fish.

3850
01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:14,230
So at some point that whole thing had to
have been covered with ocean water and

3851
01:53:15,411 --> 01:53:15,920
where are,

3852
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:16,281
you know,

3853
01:53:16,281 --> 01:53:19,910
at least a thousand miles
inland from the Pacific Ocean.

3854
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:22,310
So it is such a mind fuck,

3855
01:53:22,311 --> 01:53:23,210
it's not even funny.

3856
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:24,620
So how many years,

3857
01:53:24,621 --> 01:53:25,670
like I know there was,

3858
01:53:25,671 --> 01:53:29,870
is it Tia Naco where they said it was
close to what they believe or what are the

3859
01:53:29,930 --> 01:53:33,410
alternative theories is it
was close to 28,000 years.

3860
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,400
20,000 years ago.

3861
01:53:34,401 --> 01:53:35,300
It was on the water.

3862
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:36,193
Yes.

3863
01:53:36,290 --> 01:53:36,621
Oh No,

3864
01:53:36,621 --> 01:53:36,831
no,

3865
01:53:36,831 --> 01:53:37,011
no,

3866
01:53:37,011 --> 01:53:37,821
no near the water.

3867
01:53:37,821 --> 01:53:42,080
But Puma Pimco might've been a
port on the water at some point,

3868
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:44,030
a harbor of some point in time,

3869
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:45,530
but that would mean that,

3870
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:48,740
that they had there've
been ocean water at 12,000,

3871
01:53:48,741 --> 01:53:50,570
500 feet above sea level unless,

3872
01:53:50,571 --> 01:53:50,871
you know,

3873
01:53:50,871 --> 01:53:55,871
there was a cataclysmic event that
raised the entire plateau in a relatively

3874
01:53:56,211 --> 01:53:57,590
short period of time.

3875
01:53:58,070 --> 01:53:58,491
Now,

3876
01:53:58,491 --> 01:54:02,570
why war that would it do it uniformly so
that everything was like level when it

3877
01:54:02,571 --> 01:54:03,404
got up to him.

3878
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:04,790
I am not a geologist,

3879
01:54:04,791 --> 01:54:05,630
I have no idea.

3880
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:09,940
But what's also fascinating
is that right next to a Puma,

3881
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:12,320
Puma [inaudible] is Lake Titicaca,

3882
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:15,050
which is the highest
navigable lake in the world.

3883
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:16,550
And um,

3884
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:17,300
you know,

3885
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:19,780
people have also suggested that,

3886
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:20,070
uh,

3887
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:25,070
to Lake Titicaca was so big that it
actually connected with Puma Punahou and

3888
01:54:25,311 --> 01:54:29,090
that Puma punker was merely a harbor
by a lake and not by the ocean.

3889
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:30,110
That's what I was thinking of.

3890
01:54:30,140 --> 01:54:30,761
That was the,

3891
01:54:30,761 --> 01:54:30,851
uh,

3892
01:54:30,851 --> 01:54:31,880
the store that I had read.

3893
01:54:32,030 --> 01:54:32,601
It wasn't,

3894
01:54:32,601 --> 01:54:33,141
it was a,

3895
01:54:33,141 --> 01:54:33,820
it wasn't Tinoco.

3896
01:54:33,820 --> 01:54:34,730
Nahko was uh,

3897
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:36,051
the other one will say it again.

3898
01:54:36,051 --> 01:54:36,300
Puma.

3899
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:36,610
Puma.

3900
01:54:36,610 --> 01:54:38,720
Which Gacaca?

3901
01:54:38,721 --> 01:54:39,080
Yeah,

3902
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:41,480
that's what I remembered
that I was trying to recall.

3903
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:43,460
So how far away is that?

3904
01:54:43,461 --> 01:54:44,300
Like in miles,

3905
01:54:44,350 --> 01:54:45,183
but 50,

3906
01:54:45,210 --> 01:54:45,641
50.

3907
01:54:45,641 --> 01:54:46,700
That's shit that ain't show.

3908
01:54:46,850 --> 01:54:47,390
No.

3909
01:54:47,390 --> 01:54:50,300
If you think about how many
different times there's,

3910
01:54:50,301 --> 01:54:50,500
uh,

3911
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:50,850
been,

3912
01:54:50,850 --> 01:54:51,080
uh,

3913
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:55,520
lakes that we found that a dry lake beds
like groom lake where area 51 is used

3914
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:56,250
to be a lake.

3915
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:56,570
Right.

3916
01:54:56,570 --> 01:54:56,931
You know,

3917
01:54:56,931 --> 01:54:57,950
and there there was,

3918
01:54:57,980 --> 01:54:59,420
there's a lot of dry lake beds,

3919
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:02,150
grand the world and used
to be a body of water.

3920
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:04,490
What is it at the bottom
and some spots still?

3921
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:04,621
Well,

3922
01:55:04,621 --> 01:55:04,770
yeah,

3923
01:55:04,770 --> 01:55:05,260
the rivers,

3924
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:06,500
you've got the Colorado River going,

3925
01:55:06,501 --> 01:55:07,670
but it used to be even bigger,

3926
01:55:07,730 --> 01:55:09,200
something cut through all that shit,

3927
01:55:09,201 --> 01:55:12,350
which is incredible if you look at the
Grand Canyon and think that that was all

3928
01:55:12,351 --> 01:55:13,820
carved by all river.

3929
01:55:13,821 --> 01:55:15,620
Like what a saying,

3930
01:55:15,630 --> 01:55:16,463
man,

3931
01:55:16,650 --> 01:55:18,820
river and fucking carved
this shit to the ground.

3932
01:55:18,821 --> 01:55:20,030
How long did that take?

3933
01:55:20,150 --> 01:55:20,900
Exactly.

3934
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:25,900
It's really tough for us to wrap our
heads around the idea of 28,000 years ago

3935
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:26,460
now.

3936
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:26,931
And then,

3937
01:55:26,931 --> 01:55:31,340
and then we miles a lake ain't shit
for 20 and then we claim that we know

3938
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:31,911
everything.

3939
01:55:31,911 --> 01:55:36,830
She to me the moment someone claims to
have all the answers run for the hills

3940
01:55:36,831 --> 01:55:37,130
man.

3941
01:55:37,130 --> 01:55:37,520
Well it's,

3942
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:38,353
nobody knows.

3943
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:43,100
The real issue is a lot of times we have
a few things that we know for a fact

3944
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:45,330
and then we start
teaching those few things.

3945
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:46,550
And then as in,

3946
01:55:46,710 --> 01:55:49,140
especially in terms of ancient history,

3947
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:51,030
there's a lot of speculation.

3948
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:52,470
There's a lot of,

3949
01:55:52,471 --> 01:55:55,470
well what we think is this and
once they start teaching that,

3950
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,120
that's when things get tricky.

3951
01:55:57,300 --> 01:56:00,810
Because if you have a theory and you
teach that theory and then all sudden some

3952
01:56:00,811 --> 01:56:04,710
other shit comes up that might make all
that Shit you've been teaching for 10

3953
01:56:04,711 --> 01:56:05,040
years.

3954
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,240
Utter Horse Shit,

3955
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:08,520
that's hard to accept for a lot of people.

3956
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:12,300
Well cause it's their ego is attached
to what they believe in their,

3957
01:56:12,301 --> 01:56:12,661
you know,

3958
01:56:12,661 --> 01:56:13,650
attached to what they're teaching.

3959
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:14,610
Oh f absolutely.

3960
01:56:14,611 --> 01:56:16,350
All of that is a problem
in academia isn't it?

3961
01:56:16,351 --> 01:56:17,190
And when it comes to,

3962
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:17,821
you know,

3963
01:56:17,821 --> 01:56:18,960
all these ancient sites,

3964
01:56:18,990 --> 01:56:19,830
of course,

3965
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:22,200
and Ellen with likened it
to the same thing where,

3966
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:22,771
you know,

3967
01:56:22,771 --> 01:56:23,520
it doesn't matter.

3968
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:27,300
Here we are in Pasadena and there's
the Huntington Library right here.

3969
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:31,500
And the Huntington Library has some of
the most precious books in the world.

3970
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:33,210
Some of them are textbooks,

3971
01:56:33,430 --> 01:56:38,430
beautifully leather bound textbooks that
were used at universities at the best

3972
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,290
universities in the world,

3973
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:40,831
you know,

3974
01:56:40,831 --> 01:56:43,170
in London or here in the states,

3975
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:44,610
or uh,

3976
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:45,930
well not back then the states,

3977
01:56:45,931 --> 01:56:46,764
but uh,

3978
01:56:46,770 --> 01:56:47,101
you know,

3979
01:56:47,101 --> 01:56:52,101
at different places of
education and those books today,

3980
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:53,230
you,

3981
01:56:53,230 --> 01:56:53,470
you,

3982
01:56:53,470 --> 01:56:57,300
you look at them and I challenge you to
find anything in there that's a science

3983
01:56:57,301 --> 01:56:59,610
book that still holds true today.

3984
01:57:00,190 --> 01:57:00,360
Right?

3985
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:00,630
Yet,

3986
01:57:00,630 --> 01:57:05,630
those books were printed
so that the students at the
universities could read and

3987
01:57:05,911 --> 01:57:08,040
study and perform tests on these things.

3988
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:13,080
And that was the cutting edge
of science back in the day.

3989
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:14,063
And today,

3990
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:14,911
nothing holds true.

3991
01:57:14,911 --> 01:57:19,530
So I think it's going to be the same thing
about the way less stuff that we know

3992
01:57:19,531 --> 01:57:19,770
about.

3993
01:57:19,770 --> 01:57:20,603
We'll be wrong,

3994
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:25,590
but there will be things that a hundred
years from now that we think today is

3995
01:57:25,591 --> 01:57:26,310
true.

3996
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:27,270
A hundred years from now,

3997
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:30,300
we will know that in fact we were wrong.

3998
01:57:30,690 --> 01:57:33,900
Do you think that if the shit
hits the fan and the aliens come,

3999
01:57:33,901 --> 01:57:34,441
the government,

4000
01:57:34,441 --> 01:57:35,190
we'll call you,

4001
01:57:35,190 --> 01:57:38,130
say Giorgio you want to come
down here and take care of this?

4002
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:40,920
We need someone who understands
what the fuck is going on.

4003
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:41,220
Look,

4004
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:42,053
I'll go.

4005
01:57:42,060 --> 01:57:42,631
But no,

4006
01:57:42,631 --> 01:57:43,710
I don't think it's going to happen.

4007
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:44,120
No Way.

4008
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:49,120
Because you volunteering yourself as the
representative of human beings to the

4009
01:57:49,741 --> 01:57:53,280
extra show world that has already actually
been taken care of by someone at the

4010
01:57:53,281 --> 01:57:53,671
UN,

4011
01:57:53,671 --> 01:57:54,504
believe it or not.

4012
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:55,231
Yes,

4013
01:57:55,231 --> 01:57:55,591
yes,

4014
01:57:55,591 --> 01:57:56,380
absolutely.

4015
01:57:56,380 --> 01:57:57,210
They um,

4016
01:57:57,210 --> 01:57:57,481
yeah,

4017
01:57:57,481 --> 01:57:57,580
the,

4018
01:57:57,580 --> 01:57:57,960
he's the,

4019
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:00,540
he's the liaison between
aliens and human being.

4020
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:01,150
That's his gig.

4021
01:58:01,150 --> 01:58:01,990
Should the case comes,

4022
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:02,880
you have another job too.

4023
01:58:02,881 --> 01:58:03,461
I hope he has no,

4024
01:58:03,461 --> 01:58:04,294
no idea.

4025
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:05,990
I hope this isn't something
we're actually finish things.

4026
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,380
It's so funny that you know,

4027
01:58:07,381 --> 01:58:09,810
they have not chosen somebody who,

4028
01:58:09,811 --> 01:58:10,310
you know,

4029
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:10,950
you know,

4030
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:12,420
has chosen this as a,

4031
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:13,830
the stuff that they do.

4032
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:14,760
Um,

4033
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:15,031
you know,

4034
01:58:15,031 --> 01:58:16,890
cause I think that might be important,

4035
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:17,250
but,

4036
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:17,521
you know,

4037
01:58:17,521 --> 01:58:18,390
call me crazy.

4038
01:58:18,750 --> 01:58:19,121
Well,

4039
01:58:19,121 --> 01:58:19,350
uh,

4040
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:22,470
maybe the guy to us as the UN fascinating.

4041
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:23,970
A closet alien dude.

4042
01:58:24,050 --> 01:58:24,210
Oh,

4043
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:25,043
who knows?

4044
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:27,000
You mad that you could get that Gig.

4045
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:27,500
It's like,

4046
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:27,720
what?

4047
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:28,553
Like a girl.

4048
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:29,730
Oh my God.

4049
01:58:29,730 --> 01:58:31,860
I didn't even get to
audition for that role.

4050
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:34,050
And now he's even Chelsea.

4051
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:36,090
And I just think it's funny,

4052
01:58:36,091 --> 01:58:36,511
just like,

4053
01:58:36,511 --> 01:58:37,260
you know,

4054
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:38,220
one of the first,

4055
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:38,650
uh,

4056
01:58:38,650 --> 01:58:39,450
uh,

4057
01:58:39,450 --> 01:58:40,231
alien movies or,

4058
01:58:40,231 --> 01:58:40,460
or,

4059
01:58:40,460 --> 01:58:41,890
or science fiction movies that,

4060
01:58:41,891 --> 01:58:42,724
that

4061
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:44,133
in my opinion,

4062
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:44,870
uh,

4063
01:58:44,870 --> 01:58:48,640
proposed the real idea in
promethium if you go out there,

4064
01:58:48,641 --> 01:58:52,900
you have to bring at
least one archaeologist
prometheus's the first movie,

4065
01:58:52,901 --> 01:58:56,980
who has done that in every other a
science fiction movie that you have.

4066
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:58,810
There's never an archeologist on board,

4067
01:58:58,960 --> 01:58:59,290
you know,

4068
01:58:59,290 --> 01:59:00,160
and to me it's like,

4069
01:59:00,161 --> 01:59:00,911
are you kidding me?

4070
01:59:00,911 --> 01:59:05,860
That's the first person that
you go somewhere because
of comparison of our past

4071
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:08,680
with what's whatever's going
on at the destination planet.

4072
01:59:08,890 --> 01:59:12,010
But instead they bring a whole
bunch of Yahoos with them that,

4073
01:59:12,011 --> 01:59:12,371
you know,

4074
01:59:12,371 --> 01:59:13,600
of course it's all entertainment.

4075
01:59:13,601 --> 01:59:14,410
I understand.

4076
01:59:14,410 --> 01:59:16,390
But I think that the
whole Prometheans thing,

4077
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:16,901
it's a,

4078
01:59:16,901 --> 01:59:17,860
it's a beautiful movie.

4079
01:59:17,861 --> 01:59:19,150
It's a great entertainment.

4080
01:59:19,430 --> 01:59:20,120
I didn't like it.

4081
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:20,751
It's really good.

4082
01:59:20,751 --> 01:59:21,261
Look at,

4083
01:59:21,261 --> 01:59:22,094
but I didn't like it.

4084
01:59:22,130 --> 01:59:25,080
I thought there's just too many
hokey fucking moments in it.

4085
01:59:25,150 --> 01:59:25,590
It's,

4086
01:59:25,590 --> 01:59:27,980
I thought it could have
been an incredible movie,

4087
01:59:27,981 --> 01:59:30,410
but it seemed like
there's seemed like some,

4088
01:59:30,650 --> 01:59:30,980
I dunno,

4089
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:33,110
I would love to sit down with Ridley
Scott and get high with him and go,

4090
01:59:33,111 --> 01:59:33,944
what happened man?

4091
01:59:34,370 --> 01:59:35,510
Get him on the podcast.

4092
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:38,360
Scott's not doing my fucking podcast.

4093
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:40,280
I'm doing a surprise guys.

4094
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:41,193
Podcasts.

4095
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:44,080
Most especially not after I told
them that I don't like for me.

4096
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:44,840
Yes.

4097
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:45,320
He'd be like,

4098
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:45,650
Hey,

4099
01:59:45,650 --> 01:59:46,940
fucking punk ass bitch.

4100
01:59:46,941 --> 01:59:49,640
Did fear factor shitting
on Prometheans but a,

4101
01:59:49,641 --> 01:59:50,720
I loved alien.

4102
01:59:50,721 --> 01:59:51,650
I love gladiator.

4103
01:59:51,651 --> 01:59:52,431
I think he's amazing.

4104
01:59:52,431 --> 01:59:53,390
He does amazing movies.

4105
01:59:53,391 --> 01:59:54,021
But that movie,

4106
01:59:54,021 --> 01:59:54,560
it just was,

4107
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:55,640
it was okay.

4108
01:59:55,641 --> 01:59:57,680
I would even see it again if
it was on TV or something.

4109
01:59:57,681 --> 02:00:00,080
I might even buy the DVD just
to watch it for a little while,

4110
02:00:00,590 --> 02:00:01,021
but it just,

4111
02:00:01,021 --> 02:00:02,180
it could have been so much more.

4112
02:00:02,330 --> 02:00:03,163
But it was a,

4113
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:04,640
the idea behind it that,

4114
02:00:04,670 --> 02:00:05,240
you know,

4115
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:06,890
we were engineered and created.

4116
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:07,640
It's a,

4117
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:09,530
they handled that I thought pretty well.

4118
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:10,720
I thought they handled.

4119
02:00:10,721 --> 02:00:11,210
Uh,

4120
02:00:11,210 --> 02:00:11,541
it was,

4121
02:00:11,541 --> 02:00:12,380
it was fascinating.

4122
02:00:12,381 --> 02:00:14,530
You know the concept behind it though,

4123
02:00:14,570 --> 02:00:16,430
the black stuff that becomes the alien,

4124
02:00:16,431 --> 02:00:19,250
there's a little kind of a pain the
ass and it was hard to wrap your head

4125
02:00:19,251 --> 02:00:19,551
around.

4126
02:00:19,551 --> 02:00:20,940
Like they have a chart of the,

4127
02:00:21,050 --> 02:00:23,360
the morphology and like how,

4128
02:00:23,390 --> 02:00:24,950
how people become that thing,

4129
02:00:24,951 --> 02:00:26,090
how that thing is created,

4130
02:00:26,091 --> 02:00:28,550
how the actual alien from
the first movie aliens,

4131
02:00:28,551 --> 02:00:29,930
he have actually charted it out.

4132
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:31,530
Like where it comes from like this.

4133
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:33,190
Like when a man gets in,

4134
02:00:33,191 --> 02:00:34,790
check that out and gives it to a woman,

4135
02:00:34,791 --> 02:00:37,790
then it creates this kind of a
fucking octopus looking thing.

4136
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:42,590
And when the woman got pregnant that's
why it's because it was a man who got

4137
02:00:42,890 --> 02:00:43,580
infected.

4138
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:47,270
Then he impregnated her and then the
infection takes that form so that it

4139
02:00:47,271 --> 02:00:52,271
produces one type of offspring or if one
of the engineer's gets infected then it

4140
02:00:52,371 --> 02:00:54,350
produces another type of thing.

4141
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:57,650
And it's like they've
all plotted it all out.

4142
02:00:57,651 --> 02:00:58,730
Like at the end when the end,

4143
02:00:58,790 --> 02:00:59,480
spoiler,

4144
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:00,313
spoiler alert,

4145
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:01,970
shouldn't be saying any spoilers.

4146
02:01:02,270 --> 02:01:04,490
I shouldn't tell people what happened.

4147
02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:05,440
It's not bad way,

4148
02:01:05,510 --> 02:01:07,460
but it's just not as
good as alien alien one.

4149
02:01:07,461 --> 02:01:09,530
It's the shit still to this day,

4150
02:01:09,531 --> 02:01:13,490
one of the greatest movies of all time
aliens was good to aliens is good and

4151
02:01:13,550 --> 02:01:14,750
differently different but good.

4152
02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:15,903
Very Fun.

4153
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:17,270
But the aliens were too easy to kill.

4154
02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:18,170
That's what pissed me off.

4155
02:01:18,171 --> 02:01:20,960
It's like all of a sudden you can kill
him like that because the first one,

4156
02:01:20,961 --> 02:01:24,170
that one alien was super
sneaky and fucked everybody up.

4157
02:01:24,350 --> 02:01:28,340
Now they're like real obvious
in your face running at you.

4158
02:01:28,370 --> 02:01:28,581
Like,

4159
02:01:28,581 --> 02:01:29,510
come on man.

4160
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:32,000
Like they were like masters.

4161
02:01:32,001 --> 02:01:35,480
Like the first alien was always creeping
up on bitches and then jacking him and

4162
02:01:35,481 --> 02:01:39,500
the second one like and is running
at you and then you have to shot it.

4163
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:40,140
Um,

4164
02:01:40,140 --> 02:01:41,330
it was still a fun movie,

4165
02:01:41,331 --> 02:01:42,890
but in my opinion,

4166
02:01:42,891 --> 02:01:45,170
they change the
characteristics of the thing.

4167
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:47,120
If aliens was,

4168
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:52,180
all these things were super clever and
all these things are really stealthy and

4169
02:01:52,191 --> 02:01:52,650
they moved on,

4170
02:01:52,650 --> 02:01:54,800
that would've been an even
more terrifying movie.

4171
02:01:54,801 --> 02:01:55,210
It was.

4172
02:01:55,210 --> 02:01:56,870
It was really hard to kill them.

4173
02:01:57,230 --> 02:01:59,240
But they're just out there
running at you and you shoot them.

4174
02:01:59,330 --> 02:01:59,541
I mean,

4175
02:01:59,541 --> 02:02:01,730
it seems change the whole fucking movie,

4176
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:02,580
you know,

4177
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:03,020
Sam,

4178
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:04,820
the advent of video games,

4179
02:02:05,150 --> 02:02:05,940
is that what it is?

4180
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:06,570
That's what it is.

4181
02:02:06,570 --> 02:02:07,690
Became like a,

4182
02:02:08,490 --> 02:02:08,920
uh,

4183
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:09,980
aliens vs Predator.

4184
02:02:10,010 --> 02:02:10,843
How'd that happen?

4185
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:11,690
Terrible.

4186
02:02:11,690 --> 02:02:12,230
Terrible,

4187
02:02:12,230 --> 02:02:13,063
ridiculous.

4188
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:14,990
Combining two fucking silly movies.

4189
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:16,630
One of them takes place in the future.

4190
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:17,390
Fuck.

4191
02:02:17,390 --> 02:02:18,590
Why don't it takes place now?

4192
02:02:18,591 --> 02:02:19,401
One of it takes place,

4193
02:02:19,401 --> 02:02:22,490
like how fucking thousand years
from now and these they're all bat.

4194
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:24,140
Come on right out of here.

4195
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:24,441
No,

4196
02:02:24,441 --> 02:02:25,090
I love it.

4197
02:02:25,090 --> 02:02:27,950
It doesn't have to have some sort of an
alien vs Predator didn't have some sort

4198
02:02:27,951 --> 02:02:30,230
of an ancient aliens yes to it did it,

4199
02:02:30,231 --> 02:02:30,460
did

4200
02:02:30,460 --> 02:02:30,851
that,

4201
02:02:30,851 --> 02:02:31,684
uh,

4202
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:32,650
uh,

4203
02:02:32,650 --> 02:02:37,650
the predators were worshiped
by the Maya and there,

4204
02:02:38,650 --> 02:02:43,210
there was this fight going on between
the predators and to Maya or the aliens

4205
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:44,740
ever since Mayan Times.

4206
02:02:44,741 --> 02:02:47,020
And the mines were in between.

4207
02:02:47,021 --> 02:02:49,810
And that's how they disappear because
they all got eaten up and things like

4208
02:02:49,811 --> 02:02:50,644
that.

4209
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:51,573
So I mean,

4210
02:02:51,730 --> 02:02:52,600
interesting,

4211
02:02:52,601 --> 02:02:53,440
but a trip.

4212
02:02:53,590 --> 02:02:54,423
Yeah.

4213
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:54,970
What,

4214
02:02:54,970 --> 02:02:55,880
what is the

4215
02:02:56,110 --> 02:03:01,110
best version a and you think
in like science fiction of
what alien life is going

4216
02:03:02,441 --> 02:03:02,651
to be.

4217
02:03:02,651 --> 02:03:03,700
Do you think it was for me atheists

4218
02:03:04,530 --> 02:03:05,430
most recently?

4219
02:03:05,431 --> 02:03:06,210
Yes.

4220
02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:08,100
But then you have to ask yourself,

4221
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:08,700
you know,

4222
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:10,020
who created the engineers,

4223
02:03:10,350 --> 02:03:12,540
who engineered engineers and this is why,

4224
02:03:12,541 --> 02:03:12,751
you know,

4225
02:03:12,751 --> 02:03:13,501
in my opinion,

4226
02:03:13,501 --> 02:03:18,501
you can never really lose your belief
in some all encompassing force in the

4227
02:03:18,841 --> 02:03:19,321
universe,

4228
02:03:19,321 --> 02:03:20,820
which I referred to as God.

4229
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:21,840
Uh,

4230
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:22,410
you know,

4231
02:03:22,410 --> 02:03:24,390
or it was actually the vice vice versa.

4232
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:25,440
Um,

4233
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:26,010
you know,

4234
02:03:26,010 --> 02:03:29,550
but other science fiction movies
that portray did wonderfully was,

4235
02:03:29,551 --> 02:03:29,910
you know,

4236
02:03:29,910 --> 02:03:33,060
the first total recall or star gate,

4237
02:03:33,140 --> 02:03:33,411
the,

4238
02:03:33,411 --> 02:03:35,340
the original theatrical release,

4239
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:36,300
um,

4240
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:37,500
mission to Mars.

4241
02:03:37,770 --> 02:03:40,050
All those movies were wonderful,

4242
02:03:40,051 --> 02:03:45,051
ancient alien type movies that describe
the ancient alien theory very nicely,

4243
02:03:46,050 --> 02:03:47,460
not necessarily to the,

4244
02:03:47,490 --> 02:03:48,060
you know,

4245
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:49,350
in Star Gates case,

4246
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:49,861
uh,

4247
02:03:49,861 --> 02:03:51,090
accurately in my opinion,

4248
02:03:51,091 --> 02:03:53,100
because I don't think we
were ever a slave species,

4249
02:03:53,101 --> 02:03:53,701
for example,

4250
02:03:53,701 --> 02:03:58,140
as so many other ancient alien theorists
a subscribe to that decision on as

4251
02:03:58,141 --> 02:03:58,381
well.

4252
02:03:58,381 --> 02:03:58,650
Right?

4253
02:03:58,650 --> 02:03:59,010
Yeah.

4254
02:03:59,010 --> 02:03:59,251
Yeah.

4255
02:03:59,251 --> 02:03:59,940
And that'll always,

4256
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:00,541
and he knows his,

4257
02:04:00,541 --> 02:04:03,600
I told him this when he was still alive
that I actually disagreed with him.

4258
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:04,070
Daniel,

4259
02:04:04,070 --> 02:04:05,430
let's agree with [inaudible] of course.

4260
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:07,800
But the thing is it
doesn't matter very cocky.

4261
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:09,900
It doesn't matter because in the end,

4262
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:15,140
the theory itself that we were visited
remains the same whether we are a slave

4263
02:04:15,331 --> 02:04:16,230
species or not.

4264
02:04:16,231 --> 02:04:17,880
And I chose to think that we're not.

4265
02:04:17,930 --> 02:04:21,210
Why do you choose irrelevant that
why do you make that distinction?

4266
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:26,420
Because he proposed that we were created
as worker bees to mine gold mine gold

4267
02:04:27,061 --> 02:04:31,330
for the Anunnaki who needed gold for their
atmosphere on their home planet named

4268
02:04:31,370 --> 02:04:36,240
Nibiru meets you cock who has
proposed or calculated that,

4269
02:04:36,241 --> 02:04:36,810
uh,

4270
02:04:36,810 --> 02:04:40,050
there is the same amount of gold on any,

4271
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:41,130
um,

4272
02:04:41,130 --> 02:04:43,050
body found in the universe.

4273
02:04:43,170 --> 02:04:47,280
So to suggest that they had to come
specifically here to find gold,

4274
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:49,680
logically speaking doesn't make much sense

4275
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:51,710
saying that gold exists on Saturn.

4276
02:04:51,711 --> 02:04:52,970
Gold exists on Neptune.

4277
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:56,710
Every single planetary body in
all have the same amount of gold.

4278
02:04:56,740 --> 02:04:57,130
Yes.

4279
02:04:57,130 --> 02:04:59,080
Because it all expanded from the Big Bang.

4280
02:04:59,081 --> 02:05:00,760
It all was distributed evenly.

4281
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:01,960
What about gas plants?

4282
02:05:02,110 --> 02:05:02,943
Gas?

4283
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:03,610
You know,

4284
02:05:03,610 --> 02:05:05,440
you would have to ask Kako for this,

4285
02:05:05,441 --> 02:05:10,060
but the whole idea that solid objects
contain the same amount of gold,

4286
02:05:10,340 --> 02:05:12,190
what he proposed that,

4287
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:12,701
you know,

4288
02:05:12,701 --> 02:05:16,420
aliens wouldn't have to come
here if they wanted to mine gold.

4289
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:17,473
Well,

4290
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:19,520
maybe it's both.

4291
02:05:20,210 --> 02:05:23,180
Maybe they came here to engineer people,

4292
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:24,740
but they also need gold.

4293
02:05:24,860 --> 02:05:26,990
So they engineered people to make gold.

4294
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:27,950
But it's both.

4295
02:05:27,980 --> 02:05:28,820
It's not just,

4296
02:05:28,821 --> 02:05:29,520
it's like a,

4297
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:29,720
a,

4298
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:30,920
a dual project,

4299
02:05:30,990 --> 02:05:31,430
Sean.

4300
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:32,270
Just an evolutionary.

4301
02:05:32,350 --> 02:05:32,740
Yeah,

4302
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:32,901
no,

4303
02:05:32,901 --> 02:05:33,190
that's,

4304
02:05:33,190 --> 02:05:34,120
that's an interesting,

4305
02:05:34,121 --> 02:05:34,331
uh,

4306
02:05:34,331 --> 02:05:34,750
um,

4307
02:05:34,750 --> 02:05:35,111
you know,

4308
02:05:35,111 --> 02:05:36,430
approach to looking at it.

4309
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:37,361
However,

4310
02:05:37,361 --> 02:05:38,170
you know,

4311
02:05:38,170 --> 02:05:39,640
the whole slave species thing,

4312
02:05:39,641 --> 02:05:44,641
it feeds into this current belief
that we are beholden to someone else.

4313
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:48,040
That we are not in control of our lives,

4314
02:05:48,280 --> 02:05:53,020
that we and our governments are ruled by
aliens and that there's Reptilians and

4315
02:05:53,140 --> 02:05:55,990
all that bullshit that,

4316
02:05:55,991 --> 02:05:56,200
uh,

4317
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:56,621
you know,

4318
02:05:56,621 --> 02:06:01,300
people really think that they are no
longer in charge of their own lives.

4319
02:06:01,301 --> 02:06:02,710
That everything is,

4320
02:06:02,890 --> 02:06:03,401
you know,

4321
02:06:03,401 --> 02:06:03,761
a,

4322
02:06:03,761 --> 02:06:07,030
a planned and the overlooked
by our alien overlord.

4323
02:06:07,390 --> 02:06:08,440
And that to me,

4324
02:06:09,190 --> 02:06:10,023
you know,

4325
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:15,300
even to a guy like me that is
too fucking far out and come on,

4326
02:06:17,260 --> 02:06:17,950
just go back,

4327
02:06:17,950 --> 02:06:19,300
come back to reality.

4328
02:06:19,420 --> 02:06:23,860
Put your feet on the ground and trying
to differentiate between what's actually

4329
02:06:23,861 --> 02:06:25,990
feasible and something that's just,

4330
02:06:25,991 --> 02:06:26,350
you know,

4331
02:06:26,350 --> 02:06:27,640
the sciences are you

4332
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:29,590
and I part ways cause
I think it is feasible.

4333
02:06:29,620 --> 02:06:32,290
I think if you look at us
and what we do to dolphins,

4334
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:34,150
we forced them to do tricks for fish.

4335
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:35,470
What we do to kill a whale.

4336
02:06:35,471 --> 02:06:35,860
So you know,

4337
02:06:35,860 --> 02:06:37,630
which we know are intelligent creatures,

4338
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:37,770
right?

4339
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:39,100
Just can't understand what they're saying.

4340
02:06:39,310 --> 02:06:42,400
They're intelligent enough to understand
voice commands so they understand when

4341
02:06:42,401 --> 02:06:45,280
we want specific things and
they do them by voice command.

4342
02:06:45,580 --> 02:06:48,060
And yet we don't understand
what the fuck they're saying.

4343
02:06:49,930 --> 02:06:50,351
We don't know.

4344
02:06:50,351 --> 02:06:50,870
Walked down.

4345
02:06:50,870 --> 02:06:54,820
Many people or scientists have been trying
now ever since we were able to record

4346
02:06:54,821 --> 02:06:55,150
stuff.

4347
02:06:55,150 --> 02:06:55,390
Right.

4348
02:06:55,390 --> 02:06:55,901
But the,

4349
02:06:55,901 --> 02:06:59,110
but the point is we know they're
intelligent life forms and we slave him,

4350
02:06:59,290 --> 02:07:00,123
we enslave them.

4351
02:07:00,250 --> 02:07:01,930
We absolutely in slave dolphins,

4352
02:07:01,931 --> 02:07:03,520
we absolutely in slave killer whales,

4353
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:06,490
we know they're intelligent and we just
assume that because they can't create

4354
02:07:06,491 --> 02:07:09,520
culture cause they can't alter
their environment because
they don't have thumbs.

4355
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:12,550
We know they have
language complex language.

4356
02:07:12,551 --> 02:07:15,730
So we know that unlike any
other animal on the earth,

4357
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,020
besides humans,

4358
02:07:17,140 --> 02:07:20,590
that they are actually communicating
with very specific words.

4359
02:07:20,591 --> 02:07:21,011
In fact,

4360
02:07:21,011 --> 02:07:24,280
they have dialects and a very complex
language that we can't decipher.

4361
02:07:24,550 --> 02:07:27,610
We know like monkeys have like certain
things that this means the cat.

4362
02:07:27,611 --> 02:07:27,821
You know,

4363
02:07:27,821 --> 02:07:28,360
this is like the,

4364
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:28,691
you know,

4365
02:07:28,691 --> 02:07:29,830
they communicate with each other.

4366
02:07:29,950 --> 02:07:31,540
Just very rudimentary and crude.

4367
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:32,583
Not like dolphins.

4368
02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:35,470
Dolphins have a complicated
language as do whales,

4369
02:07:35,590 --> 02:07:36,610
but yet look what we do to them,

4370
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:37,030
right?

4371
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:37,900
Put Him in a fucking cage.

4372
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:38,620
I think.

4373
02:07:38,620 --> 02:07:43,620
I think the captivity of animals
except for preservation is barbaric.

4374
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:45,401
It is,

4375
02:07:45,401 --> 02:07:49,990
but it's done and it's done by every
single animal on this planet that has a

4376
02:07:49,991 --> 02:07:51,400
power over another pow,

4377
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:51,730
uh,

4378
02:07:51,730 --> 02:07:52,150
animal.

4379
02:07:52,150 --> 02:07:55,180
It exploited and it seems to
be a pattern in the universe.

4380
02:07:55,181 --> 02:07:55,810
It seems to be.

4381
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:57,610
If you look at biological life,

4382
02:07:57,611 --> 02:07:59,230
completely objective on this planet,

4383
02:07:59,260 --> 02:08:03,040
everything that's more intelligent or
more powerful fucks up everything that's

4384
02:08:03,041 --> 02:08:03,520
not,

4385
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:04,630
and that's just the way it is.

4386
02:08:04,780 --> 02:08:08,590
Monkeys are very intelligent
little things and chimps eat them,

4387
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:11,830
they grab them and they ripped them apart
and they eat them while they're alive.

4388
02:08:11,860 --> 02:08:12,693
And we know that.

4389
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:14,800
And we know that we do
crazy shit to monkeys.

4390
02:08:14,801 --> 02:08:16,090
We do experiments on them,

4391
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:19,510
we take chimps and we put
them in laboratories and
we put lipstick on him and

4392
02:08:19,511 --> 02:08:19,781
shit.

4393
02:08:19,781 --> 02:08:20,614
See if they die.

4394
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:21,131
I mean,

4395
02:08:21,131 --> 02:08:21,964
that's what we do.

4396
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:23,440
That's what we do.

4397
02:08:23,650 --> 02:08:26,830
And I think that if you
look at that pattern,

4398
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:29,140
our pattern of enslaving
dolphins and killer whales,

4399
02:08:29,141 --> 02:08:32,140
because we have the ability to alter
environment that they don't have,

4400
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:33,273
you know,

4401
02:08:33,340 --> 02:08:34,330
because of that,

4402
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:39,360
I would say why wouldn't something much
more intelligent than a human being

4403
02:08:40,180 --> 02:08:41,890
that's been around for a million years.

4404
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:45,700
That's completely unimpressed
with some fucking caveman or some,

4405
02:08:46,210 --> 02:08:46,570
you know,

4406
02:08:46,570 --> 02:08:50,170
Australia [inaudible] some stupid
fuck out there running around picking

4407
02:08:50,171 --> 02:08:50,951
mushrooms off a cow.

4408
02:08:50,951 --> 02:08:51,550
Shit,

4409
02:08:51,550 --> 02:08:56,550
why wouldn't we enslave them if
we is some super alien forced,

4410
02:08:56,591 --> 02:08:58,240
it's a billion years
more advanced than us.

4411
02:08:58,450 --> 02:09:01,840
Why we're saying if we do it to
everything that's on this planet,

4412
02:09:02,050 --> 02:09:02,740
why would you,

4413
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:07,510
we have this weird thing of
assuming that things are altruistic,

4414
02:09:07,570 --> 02:09:11,530
that the universe is going to be
more advanced morally than we are,

4415
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:15,730
but we show zero sign personal evolution.

4416
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:16,241
Personally,

4417
02:09:16,241 --> 02:09:21,241
I think that as society who is able to
travel between the stars has at least

4418
02:09:23,081 --> 02:09:28,081
reached such a level of awareness

4419
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:32,350
that they have at least stopped killing
each other on their own home planet.

4420
02:09:32,380 --> 02:09:35,080
Because I agree with you that
there is good and evil out there.

4421
02:09:35,110 --> 02:09:39,070
I agree with you that there might be
civilizations out there from different

4422
02:09:39,071 --> 02:09:40,600
plans of warring with each other,

4423
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:45,960
but I think that until you can reach
that level that you have to come to the

4424
02:09:46,451 --> 02:09:50,830
understanding that we have
to clean up our house first.

4425
02:09:51,160 --> 02:09:52,050
So that because,

4426
02:09:52,090 --> 02:09:57,010
because I think that you see the
whole warring thing and you know,

4427
02:09:57,550 --> 02:09:58,383
fighting,

4428
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:02,530
creating wars over religion and oil and
all those different things in the end,

4429
02:10:02,531 --> 02:10:06,100
but we have to understand is that we
are on this planet together and once we

4430
02:10:06,101 --> 02:10:07,300
realize that,

4431
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:11,800
I think that is when we will make contact
and that is when we can band together

4432
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:15,640
and potentially fight and
threat if there is one.

4433
02:10:15,790 --> 02:10:16,541
But like I said,

4434
02:10:16,541 --> 02:10:18,310
there's good and evil out there.

4435
02:10:18,460 --> 02:10:23,460
So the fact that we've been around
until 2012 after having gone through two

4436
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:28,720
genetic bottleneck situations on
planet earth with the human race,

4437
02:10:29,170 --> 02:10:34,170
I think we're in pretty good shape
of not being annihilated by whoever

4438
02:10:34,370 --> 02:10:38,660
some are proposing will annihilate
us on the 21st of December,

4439
02:10:38,660 --> 02:10:39,950
2012 which is total nonsense.

4440
02:10:40,010 --> 02:10:43,370
I think if you look at our state
of existence on this earth,

4441
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:44,960
if you look at Kim Kardashian,

4442
02:10:44,990 --> 02:10:48,590
if you look at Obama and uh,

4443
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:49,370
you know,

4444
02:10:49,370 --> 02:10:53,720
Mubarak in Egypt and you look at the
chaos in the world and you look at us

4445
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:58,930
pulling the oil out of the ground and if
you look at us just polluting the ocean

4446
02:10:59,421 --> 02:11:00,620
at pulling the resources out,

4447
02:11:00,621 --> 02:11:05,621
we act like a prison colony that
doesn't have a fucking warden.

4448
02:11:05,930 --> 02:11:08,780
We're just super duper duper complicated.

4449
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:09,291
We,

4450
02:11:09,291 --> 02:11:14,030
our whole culture acts like
someone who got to this place,

4451
02:11:14,390 --> 02:11:14,840
um,

4452
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:16,980
accidentally or was,

4453
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:22,100
was helped by whether it's humans
that are super advanced or aliens or,

4454
02:11:23,791 --> 02:11:24,980
or some sort of a thing.

4455
02:11:25,070 --> 02:11:26,570
It looks like what a prison.

4456
02:11:26,571 --> 02:11:27,740
You've got to go soon we go.

4457
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:31,010
It looks like what you would
expect if a prison was overrun,

4458
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:31,581
I mean were,

4459
02:11:31,581 --> 02:11:36,080
were so irresponsible and how we pollute
the earth so irresponsible in how we

4460
02:11:36,081 --> 02:11:37,970
utilize this incredible technology.

4461
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:38,211
No,

4462
02:11:38,211 --> 02:11:39,860
but then there are religions.

4463
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:40,560
We've slaves,

4464
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:41,090
nutty.

4465
02:11:41,090 --> 02:11:42,920
But then there are religions that propose,

4466
02:11:43,190 --> 02:11:43,820
oh,

4467
02:11:43,820 --> 02:11:46,820
it's all right because
when Jesus comes back,

4468
02:11:46,821 --> 02:11:47,270
he will,

4469
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:52,270
he will pick us up in a spaceship and
we will be brought to new earth now ha.

4470
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:54,320
And in that is the plant
that we should keep.

4471
02:11:54,410 --> 02:11:55,370
It should take care of.

4472
02:11:55,640 --> 02:12:00,260
Now what an irresponsible
teaching or proposition is that,

4473
02:12:00,410 --> 02:12:01,100
oh yeah,

4474
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:03,470
let this mother earth go to fucking shit.

4475
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:04,400
But who cares?

4476
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:07,310
Because we will be picked up
and brought to another planet.

4477
02:12:07,490 --> 02:12:08,900
Are you fucking shitting me?

4478
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:11,030
That is no longer religion,

4479
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:14,630
but that is the height of
human arrogance and insanity.

4480
02:12:14,810 --> 02:12:16,700
That is a crazy argument as well.

4481
02:12:16,701 --> 02:12:18,290
And we were crazy a idea as well,

4482
02:12:18,291 --> 02:12:22,220
but I don't think it's outside the realm
of possibility that we were in fact

4483
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:26,870
created two n and engineered to work
for these super intelligent beings.

4484
02:12:26,930 --> 02:12:27,400
I,

4485
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:27,740
yeah,

4486
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:29,540
I agree with you that it's very possible.

4487
02:12:29,570 --> 02:12:29,751
Well,

4488
02:12:29,751 --> 02:12:31,670
I mean of course it's possible.

4489
02:12:31,940 --> 02:12:32,510
Listen,

4490
02:12:32,510 --> 02:12:35,780
I really do not have the answers.

4491
02:12:35,781 --> 02:12:38,720
But if you think about what I'm saying
is if you think about how we exploit

4492
02:12:38,990 --> 02:12:40,130
everything else below us,

4493
02:12:40,190 --> 02:12:42,740
we're assuming that somewhere
up the ladder that stops.

4494
02:12:43,310 --> 02:12:45,710
But in the life that
we see my proposition,

4495
02:12:45,711 --> 02:12:46,050
yes,

4496
02:12:46,050 --> 02:12:47,690
but you look at the life that we see,

4497
02:12:47,691 --> 02:12:50,570
the intelligent life that we
see despite pita and despite,

4498
02:12:50,571 --> 02:12:51,340
you know,

4499
02:12:51,340 --> 02:12:53,960
people that are trying to propagate piece.

4500
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:55,100
It's not existing,

4501
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:57,500
but that's just more more
today than ever before.

4502
02:12:57,620 --> 02:13:02,620
But there is at the same time a paradigm
shift happening that we're experiencing

4503
02:13:02,751 --> 02:13:03,860
because I agree,

4504
02:13:03,861 --> 02:13:07,760
but there's no lines where people are
trying to break free the Dawes because

4505
02:13:07,790 --> 02:13:08,450
it's,

4506
02:13:08,450 --> 02:13:09,070
it's,

4507
02:13:09,070 --> 02:13:13,100
it's fluctuating that the time of
the dolphins I think will come,

4508
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:18,460
especially since every day more and more
people are embracing vegetarianism and

4509
02:13:18,711 --> 02:13:21,380
even veganism that's frozen closes.

4510
02:13:21,740 --> 02:13:23,510
It's delicious and cows are stupid.

4511
02:13:23,511 --> 02:13:24,320
And that's,

4512
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:24,620
that's,

4513
02:13:24,620 --> 02:13:24,941
that's his.

4514
02:13:24,941 --> 02:13:29,360
But it's a dumb thing is a paradigm
shift that has never happened before and

4515
02:13:29,361 --> 02:13:30,350
it's happening fast.

4516
02:13:30,380 --> 02:13:30,711
Right.

4517
02:13:30,711 --> 02:13:32,040
But isn't the argument that that's because

4518
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:36,810
of surplus and because people have the
first world option of being a vegetarian,

4519
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:37,381
which is,

4520
02:13:37,381 --> 02:13:37,910
you know,

4521
02:13:37,910 --> 02:13:38,190
in,

4522
02:13:38,190 --> 02:13:41,490
in most cultures it's about
staying alive and you need protein.

4523
02:13:41,491 --> 02:13:43,110
And if the only food availables fish,

4524
02:13:43,111 --> 02:13:43,944
you're eating fish.

4525
02:13:43,980 --> 02:13:44,910
If cows are available,

4526
02:13:44,911 --> 02:13:45,744
you're eating cows.

4527
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:47,430
And as our civilization,

4528
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:47,731
you know,

4529
02:13:47,731 --> 02:13:50,010
becomes more and more complex
than we have these uh,

4530
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:51,180
possibilities.

4531
02:13:51,450 --> 02:13:53,970
But I see what you're saying.

4532
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:54,301
You know,

4533
02:13:54,301 --> 02:13:56,430
I see that I would love
it if that was true.

4534
02:13:56,580 --> 02:13:59,650
If everything eventually
got to a point where you,

4535
02:13:59,660 --> 02:14:00,060
these,

4536
02:14:00,060 --> 02:14:04,310
these super intelligent being so far
advanced from us would look at us and go,

4537
02:14:04,330 --> 02:14:04,890
ah,

4538
02:14:04,890 --> 02:14:05,670
you guys are,

4539
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:06,570
you guys are pretty cool.

4540
02:14:06,571 --> 02:14:07,620
We're not going to fuck with you.

4541
02:14:07,621 --> 02:14:08,221
And when we come here,

4542
02:14:08,221 --> 02:14:08,821
we're not going to make,

4543
02:14:08,821 --> 02:14:11,610
you were going to let you play
with house and we're not going to,

4544
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:14,370
we're not going to exploit
you the way you do.

4545
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:17,370
And every other form of
life does on this planet.

4546
02:14:17,700 --> 02:14:22,260
I think that was one thing that Promethean
has got that I thought was pretty

4547
02:14:22,261 --> 02:14:26,580
probably dead on the disdain that the
engineers would have for humans after what

4548
02:14:26,581 --> 02:14:27,450
happened and how are we do,

4549
02:14:27,451 --> 02:14:30,720
how we turned out the same way we
would if we went to the fucking jungle.

4550
02:14:30,721 --> 02:14:34,620
And there was a tribe of chimps that
had created electricity and they were

4551
02:14:34,621 --> 02:14:36,030
shooting lightning bolts at each other.

4552
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:36,691
And you'd be like,

4553
02:14:36,691 --> 02:14:37,051
bitch,

4554
02:14:37,051 --> 02:14:38,760
what the fuck are you doing?

4555
02:14:38,890 --> 02:14:42,390
We would completely take it away from
them and if we were going to change them

4556
02:14:42,391 --> 02:14:43,224
and fix them,

4557
02:14:43,230 --> 02:14:44,150
we would have no problem.

4558
02:14:44,380 --> 02:14:44,641
Hence,

4559
02:14:44,641 --> 02:14:48,180
that's why we have stories of these
UFOS disabling nuclear plants.

4560
02:14:48,210 --> 02:14:50,160
Hence that's why we haven't
tried it and the apes.

4561
02:14:50,330 --> 02:14:53,280
But we take a champion and make it super
intelligent and it gets fucking really

4562
02:14:53,281 --> 02:14:54,114
pissed at us.

4563
02:14:54,330 --> 02:14:55,380
But we do it.

4564
02:14:56,100 --> 02:14:57,840
Giorgio sucralose has to leave,

4565
02:14:57,841 --> 02:14:58,674
ladies and gentlemen,

4566
02:14:58,890 --> 02:15:01,020
but this has been a fucking
awesome talk as always,

4567

if you go to my Twitter and today is a

4595
02:15:55,330 --> 02:15:56,940
the 26th of June,

4596
02:15:57,120 --> 02:15:59,550
he will see Giorgio's Twitter
handle cause otherwise I don't want,

4597
02:15:59,730 --> 02:16:02,790
I don't want you to lose any potential
people that might be coming out to the

4598
02:16:02,791 --> 02:16:05,360
seminar and coming to
hang with you and uh,

4599
02:16:05,690 --> 02:16:06,590
and following you on Twitter.

4600
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:07,530
You're the fucking man dude.

4601
02:16:07,710 --> 02:16:09,960
I love it Georgia and I've been
throwing us for a while now,

4602
02:16:09,961 --> 02:16:10,201
man.

4603
02:16:10,201 --> 02:16:13,290
We met in Vegas and hanged
out and hung out and hung out.

4604
02:16:13,470 --> 02:16:13,861
So,

4605
02:16:13,861 --> 02:16:14,220
uh,

4606
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:15,630
I got to know the real Georgio,

4607
02:16:15,930 --> 02:16:20,040
the man behind the ancient aliens and
I'm fucking flattered that you came by

4608
02:16:20,041 --> 02:16:20,371
again man.

4609
02:16:20,371 --> 02:16:20,881
We had a great time.

4610
02:16:20,881 --> 02:16:21,550
Are you kidding me?

4611
02:16:21,550 --> 02:16:23,280
Is My privilege to brother Joe?

4612
02:16:23,281 --> 02:16:24,390
Thank you so much.

4613
02:16:24,420 --> 02:16:25,290
I do this more often.

4614
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:25,810
Thanks.

4615
02:16:25,810 --> 02:16:26,071
All right,

4616
02:16:26,071 --> 02:16:26,940
my dirty friends.

4617
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:27,180
Uh,

4618
02:16:27,180 --> 02:16:28,710
we got a lot of shit coming up this week.

4619
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:32,200
Tomorrow we've got little Jimmy
Norton that'll be a later show.

4620
02:16:32,201 --> 02:16:34,450
He's doing the tonight show and
he's coming right over here.

4621
02:16:34,451 --> 02:16:36,310
So that'll probably be like a six o'clock.

4622
02:16:36,550 --> 02:16:39,100
And then on Friday we
got my pal Adam Score,

4623
02:16:39,101 --> 02:16:40,360
Ge who is the,

4624
02:16:40,361 --> 02:16:40,571
uh,

4625
02:16:40,571 --> 02:16:41,040
the,

4626
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:42,820
the guy who produced the union,

4627
02:16:42,821 --> 02:16:45,970
the documentary on medical
marijuana in British Columbia,

4628
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:47,260
or excuse me,

4629
02:16:47,830 --> 02:16:49,960
marijuana in British Columbia.

4630
02:16:50,190 --> 02:16:50,530
Uh,

4631
02:16:50,530 --> 02:16:55,390
which is a fantastic documentary on just
the whole history of the illegality of

4632
02:16:55,391 --> 02:16:55,871
marijuana.

4633
02:16:55,871 --> 02:16:56,051
I mean,

4634
02:16:56,051 --> 02:16:59,590
one of the best pro cannabis
documentaries it's ever been done.

4635
02:16:59,591 --> 02:17:01,510
And by way done by a guy
who doesn't smoke weed,

4636
02:17:01,930 --> 02:17:02,470
uh,

4637
02:17:02,470 --> 02:17:03,303
maybe does now.

4638
02:17:03,490 --> 02:17:04,120
Um,

4639
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:04,931
Adam's to shit though,

4640
02:17:04,931 --> 02:17:08,230
and he's going to be here on Friday and
we also have next week we're trying to

4641
02:17:08,231 --> 02:17:10,690
work out Josh Barnett and Kevin Pereira.

4642
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:11,520
So both,

4643
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:11,751
uh,

4644
02:17:11,751 --> 02:17:12,460
are on tap.

4645
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:15,490
We'll figure out when that's happening
next week and perhaps one of our comedian

4646
02:17:15,491 --> 02:17:16,210
friends as well.

4647
02:17:16,210 --> 02:17:17,260
Maybe Justin Martindale.

4648
02:17:17,700 --> 02:17:18,040
Yeah,

4649
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:18,241
he,

4650
02:17:18,241 --> 02:17:18,641
he,

4651
02:17:18,641 --> 02:17:19,030
uh,

4652
02:17:19,030 --> 02:17:20,200
tweeted me today and uh,

4653
02:17:20,210 --> 02:17:22,780
we'll will eventually work that out to Yo.

4654
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:23,201
But,

4655
02:17:23,201 --> 02:17:23,350
uh,

4656
02:17:23,350 --> 02:17:25,600
thank you everybody for
tuning in as always.

4657
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:27,130
We do this because you guys,

4658
02:17:27,131 --> 02:17:27,541
and uh,

4659
02:17:27,541 --> 02:17:29,560
I can speak for Brian
because I know that he,

4660
02:17:29,561 --> 02:17:30,160
uh,

4661
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:30,491
is,

4662
02:17:30,491 --> 02:17:30,790
uh,

4663
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:35,200
just as thrilled and honored and
appreciates all you guys as much as I do.

4664
02:17:35,201 --> 02:17:36,034
Cause this is a,

4665
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:37,360
we're having a crazy time.

4666
02:17:37,570 --> 02:17:40,330
We never thought this podcast would
ever become anything close to what it is

4667
02:17:40,331 --> 02:17:40,721
now.

4668
02:17:40,721 --> 02:17:41,260
And uh,

4669
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:41,950
it's,

4670
02:17:41,950 --> 02:17:42,281
you know,

4671
02:17:42,281 --> 02:17:43,690
the feedback that you guys give us,

4672
02:17:43,691 --> 02:17:45,940
his fucking tremendous and
we'll never stop doing this,

4673
02:17:45,941 --> 02:17:46,774
right Brian.

4674
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:48,310
We ain't going nowhere bitches.

4675
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:50,140
Don't forget we have a show here Friday.

4676
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:50,381
Oh,

4677
02:17:50,381 --> 02:17:51,130
that's right.

4678
02:17:51,130 --> 02:17:55,090
We got another powerful super show here
at the Ice House and we're going to have

4679
02:17:55,091 --> 02:17:57,430
to start calling them super
show shows cause he's deaf.

4680
02:17:57,430 --> 02:17:59,260
Squad shows are just ridiculous.

4681
02:17:59,261 --> 02:17:59,850
We had,

4682
02:17:59,850 --> 02:18:00,100
you know,

4683
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:00,311
I mean,

4684
02:18:00,311 --> 02:18:03,400
we have shows where on any
given night you have dom Irrera,

4685
02:18:03,401 --> 02:18:04,330
Greg Fitzsimmons,

4686
02:18:04,331 --> 02:18:05,260
Doug Benson,

4687
02:18:05,570 --> 02:18:07,600
Doug fucking name.

4688
02:18:07,601 --> 02:18:08,680
I'm Brendan Walsh.

4689
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:09,660
I mean Joe,

4690
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:10,600
Joey Diaz,

4691
02:18:10,601 --> 02:18:11,370
Sam triply,

4692
02:18:11,370 --> 02:18:15,490
Ari should fear so many of our
top comedian friends come by.

4693
02:18:15,491 --> 02:18:19,390
And we usually have like 10 comics that
go up and it's only 15 bucks and it's at

4694
02:18:19,391 --> 02:18:20,950
the Ice House in Pasadena,

4695
02:18:20,951 --> 02:18:23,920
which is easily one of the
greatest comedy clubs on earth.

4696
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:25,930
One of the oldest in the world,

4697
02:18:26,170 --> 02:18:27,003
the comedy club.

4698
02:18:27,030 --> 02:18:27,370
Uh,

4699
02:18:27,370 --> 02:18:31,080
it's been existence in
existence here since the 1950s.

4700
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:31,720
Yeah,

4701
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:33,130
this is a crazy place.

4702
02:18:33,131 --> 02:18:35,770
First it was like a jazz club or something
like that and then it became a comedy

4703
02:18:35,771 --> 02:18:36,041
club.

4704
02:18:36,041 --> 02:18:37,720
But it's also like a museum.

4705
02:18:37,721 --> 02:18:40,990
Like there's all these pictures of
guys in the wall from like the 1970s.

4706
02:18:41,170 --> 02:18:44,860
It's a mind blowing place and it's an
awesome comedy club and the people that

4707
02:18:44,861 --> 02:18:45,220
run it,

4708
02:18:45,220 --> 02:18:48,400
Bob is the coolest guy on the
planet and he's such a nice guy.

4709
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:51,070
The guy owns it and they're
so cool to everybody.

4710
02:18:51,071 --> 02:18:51,401
All the,

4711
02:18:51,401 --> 02:18:52,390
all the comedians here.

4712
02:18:52,391 --> 02:18:52,751
It's a,

4713
02:18:52,751 --> 02:18:55,000
it's an honor to be here and
to do our show out of here.

4714
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:55,781
So,

4715
02:18:55,781 --> 02:18:56,081
uh,

4716
02:18:56,081 --> 02:18:56,501
that's it.

4717
02:18:56,501 --> 02:18:57,131
So this Friday,

4718
02:18:57,131 --> 02:18:58,210
who's joining us so far?

4719
02:18:58,600 --> 02:18:59,190
Uh,

4720
02:18:59,190 --> 02:19:00,040
I mean it started yet.

4721
02:19:00,050 --> 02:19:00,671
You haven't even started.

4722
02:19:00,671 --> 02:19:02,590
We're going to get all
interns who were in town,

4723
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:04,950
but it'll definitely be me
and I'll definitely be Brian.

4724
02:19:05,220 --> 02:19:05,571
Jimmy,

4725
02:19:05,571 --> 02:19:06,404
maybe Jimmy wants to,

4726
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:06,880
I felt,

4727
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:08,590
I think he has to go back to New York.

4728
02:19:08,591 --> 02:19:09,760
I think he's only here until Thursday,

4786
02:20:06,440 --> 02:20:07,610
It's the exact same place.

4787
02:20:07,611 --> 02:20:08,990
The American Comedy Co,

4788
02:20:09,230 --> 02:20:09,441

4789
02:20:09,441 --> 02:20:10,340
it's in San Diego.

4790
02:20:10,341 --> 02:20:11,121
You got to do a live,

4791
02:20:11,121 --> 02:20:12,810
not a show or we're doing two,

4792
02:20:12,820 --> 02:20:13,130
nine,

4793
02:20:13,130 --> 02:20:13,500
two,

4794
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:16,250
two 90 show Saturday and
to test squad shows Friday,

4795
02:20:16,460 --> 02:20:19,580
you should have little booths set off
so people could just beat off while

4796
02:20:19,581 --> 02:20:20,120
they're looking at her.

4797
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:20,451
That's all right.

4798
02:20:20,451 --> 02:20:23,150
Just to have like a little confessional
booths where you just have a little hole

4799
02:20:23,151 --> 02:20:26,090
in the wall that you could peak out at
her and just beat off right in front of

4800
02:20:26,091 --> 02:20:26,600
her.

4801
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:26,900
No,

4802
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:27,381
don't do that.

4803
02:20:27,381 --> 02:20:28,250
That's a terrible idea.

4804
02:20:28,370 --> 02:20:29,090

4805
02:20:29,090 --> 02:20:29,923

podcast on there or something,

4807
02:20:32,841 --> 02:20:33,080
