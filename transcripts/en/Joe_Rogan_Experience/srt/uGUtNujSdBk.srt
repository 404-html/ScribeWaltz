1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,220
Ladies and gentlemen,
the one the only Joey Coco Diaz,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,340
Aka mad flavor.
Tuesday afternoon off the one.

3
00:00:09,341 --> 00:00:11,520
Oh,
one has joined the podcasts.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,980
That's right.
Brian Red Band,

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,320
the master blaster.
Reichel.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Let's up and ladies and gentlemen,
we are still sponsored by the 

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,200
fleshlight.
Before we even get started,

8
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:27,201
we're going to talk about the rubber 
vagina that we use on a weekly who I've 

9
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,760
been using it weekly,
especially initially I many times a day,

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,460
twice a day.
No wonder the fucking thing is falling 

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,221
apart,
falling apart at tropical Humbert juice 

12
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:37,221
this coming out of the helmets.
Fucking kill him.

13
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:37,800
That stuff.
You know what I'm saying?

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,260
Plus he's got barnacles on his dick.
That's what happened to sometimes not 

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,370
rubber burn.
Sometimes you whack off and you leave it

16
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:46,260
on your leg.
You wake up the next month there's a big

17
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:51,261
red spot.
Like the fucking hospital is like a 

18
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:51,261
fucking stain.

19
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:51,330
That's when you know you got to eat more
carrots,

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,430
a carrot or a bowl of fucking soup.
It was like UFC 1:14.

21
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,530
Everybody's feet with fucking yellow.
Did you notice that?

22
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:00,080
It was me.
Everybody,

23
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,580
when they pick up their feet,
when they want,

24
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,570
like the God,
that feet will fucking yellow.

25
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,810
They got to start eating more oranges 
after the weigh in.

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,550
Cocks up.
Nevermind that powdered water drink.

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,610
Anyway,
I don't know what it was.

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,440
That's.
It was a weed.

29
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:14,670
You were smoking meat.
Ayp.

30
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,730
You'd never know.
I always look at the fighters in the 

31
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:19,730
eyes.
I never look at their feet.

32
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah,
I'm just saying they're wrestling there 

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,220
in that God.
Somebody punched them.

34
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:24,550
Their feet are up and I'm like,
dude,

35
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,420
that guy's got fucking jaundice and you 
know what I'm saying?

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,150
You got big foot finish.
Don't you know,

37
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:30,960
I was just thinking about.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You often often talk about feet a lot.
I don't like feet touching me like 

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,960
digital.
Like if a man's foot touches me,

40
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:41,010
I have a fucking heart attack.
I really would like to get their feet in

41
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:46,011
your face and you deal with and you're 
sweaty and their feet are sweaty.

42
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,540
Feet literally on your face all the 
time.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,850
Always have their feet on my face.
I was watching.

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,360
I was watching the toenails.
Listen to that.

45
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:59,361
I was watching an old fight last night 
and they were going for a heel hook and 

46
00:01:59,361 --> 00:01:59,440
I was getting grossed up just watching,
watching.

47
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,540
I touched his feet like I could never 
imagine like grabbing him saying like 

48
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,710
getting the fucking tate with the show,
Nail Polish and have a fucking.

49
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,990
So if you were going to fight in the 
octagon,

50
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:11,350
you'd want to wear socks.
Oh,

51
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:16,351
like chocolate.
Dell at the legends you ever see 

52
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:16,351
chocolate fucking 10th planet got combat
boots.

53
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,520
He wears little socks.
Like chuck's a fucking dude like that.

54
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:25,521
I love all that stuff.
I wonder why you wear socks but maybe 

55
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:25,800
doesn't want to get his feet funky.
The,

56
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:28,440
uh,
the mats at Legend sometimes people walk

57
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,480
on them.
I love more the old place.

58
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,630
The new place is actually separate.
It's killed me with Jujitsu.

59
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:38,631
Was that they said over at the place.
A lot of people show up that at work 

60
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:43,461
directly.
Like they had been working 12 hours 

61
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:43,461
having watched that ass and they go to 
Jujitsu dog.

62
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:46,470
If I catch a whiff of ass,
somebody else,

63
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:49,130
I'm going to be pissed off.
Joe and I can't handle.

64
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,140
I couldn't handle the north south 
position sometimes though I would 

65
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,660
fucking die and arm pit and my face with
onion in it.

66
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,030
I think I called it that position.
Smell your butt.

67
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,150
Oh,
that's a horrible fucking position 

68
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,150
broadcast because that's what it is.
Guys.

69
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,630
Basically hold it onto your hips and 
he's got his ass in your face and he's 

70
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,810
holding you down and it's a fight and 
he's.

71
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,640
Why would you want to do this?
Seriously man.

72
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:15,641
It's like,
like I get nervous when people sit next 

73
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:15,641
to me at Mcdonald's,
you know like man,

74
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:15,990
there's a net good.
Another chair right there.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,940
Go Away.
You know?

76
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,670
And you guys are like putting butts in a
weird thing.

77
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Jitsu twos is you go into like a life 
and death struggle with some guy you 

78
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,270
just met five minutes ago.
Yeah.

79
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,570
Like what's up man?
How you doing?

80
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,850
Okay,
let's roll.

81
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Slap hands and next thing you know 
you're trying to strangle each other 

82
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,440
with a great sport.
That's what's weird when everyone who 

83
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,440
does it is cool though.
That's the thing is like,

84
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,090
it seems like it would be like kind of a
fucked up thing to do,

85
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,330
but the people that do it are so 
friendly and cool and everyone's been 

86
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:45,330
tapped.
Everyone's been through the ringer.

87
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,530
Everyone knows what it is,
just you just go out there and do it.

88
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,960
So it's,
even though it seems like it'd be like a

89
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:51,880
douchey thing,
it's actually very easy.

90
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,920
It's very fun.
You know,

91
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:55,420
it seems like it'd be like,
you know,

92
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,870
you'd be sweating it,
but it's just,

93
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,050
just do it,
you know,

94
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,690
we just do it for so long.
It's just a part of your day.

95
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,850
Yeah.
But what if you didn't know Joey Diaz 

96
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:06,850
and you're like,
all right,

97
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,921
you enjoy going to do today.
And I'm sorry about the air conditioner 

98
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:08,921
is broke and it's $120.

99
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:13,410
Oh,
sometimes we have the windows open 

100
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:13,410
because it's hot as fuck in there.
I've dropped 80 pounds and it's affected

101
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,151
my stomach,
which means my ball sack at three sizes 

102
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:19,680
bigger than the last time.
The other day I stumble.

103
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,180
Your stomach somehow was sucking your 
ball sack.

104
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,190
That was taken,
the pocket was taken the effect and 

105
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:27,730
sucking,
taking the effect of that ball sack.

106
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:32,731
You know what I'm saying?
Looking at me to hear the explosion 

107
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,631
here.
I'm not going to look at the fucking 

108
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:36,631
fire cracker.
I'm going to look at the explosion.

109
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:37,270
So ever since I lost the other day,
I stumbled by a Merino.

110
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,770
Sometimes you walk past them or were you
like,

111
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:39,670
wow,
what happened?

112
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,890
And I looked at my ball sack.
I'm like,

113
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:46,891
dog,
if I ever I could use it as a colostomy 

114
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:46,891
bag.
It's if double.

115
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:47,710
If I ever have a brock Lesnar,
fuck it.

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,830
Don't put a bag of me.
It's fucking gigantic.

117
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:54,790
My balls and my dick still got the size 
and the and the endurance.

118
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,810
The ball sack doesn't even like.
I lost like three pounds on the ball 

119
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,150
sack,
which makes the ball sack tighter.

120
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,010
It's fucking huge.
His balls out and pulled it out.

121
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:08,110
Joey Diaz is famous for showing his 
balls,

122
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:10,020
famous for showing his balls at the 
comedy store,

123
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,190
showing them on stage.
Just walk around,

124
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,020
pulling them out on people because 
they're ridiculous.

125
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:16,480
They really do like,
they look like oranges,

126
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,760
like oranges is in an old ladies 
pantyhose.

127
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,790
That's what it looks.
Not believe how different they fucked 

128
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:23,790
her fucking giant man.
They're like this giant.

129
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,360
Why is it that comics all show always 
love to show their deaths and Bob's.

130
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,480
There's no other profession.
I think that I didn't work at gateway 

131
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,450
and it's like all computer salesman love
ball showing,

132
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,550
hey,
I was listening to open to do the other 

133
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,770
day and Louis Ck was on and he was 
telling a story about,

134
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,370
uh,
about j dot Moore.

135
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,060
It was on an airplane with him once,
when he was really young and j goes,

136
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,140
if I pull out my dick where you spit on 
it and he goes,

137
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,790
it goes from data because I fucking 
hated it so bad because I actually liked

138
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,110
him as a person.
He goes,

139
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:56,420
but it was just fucking fake.
Faggot put away.

140
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,160
It's,
it's really funny.

141
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,590
But the fucking questions pretty funny 
too.

142
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:04,280
If I pull out my dick spit on it.
I mean,

143
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,380
it might've been even funnier if we just
went.

144
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:06,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

145
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,690
Go.
You know,

146
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,540
why is it though of comics are fucked 
up,

147
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,950
man.
We want to do the most.

148
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,230
We want to do the inappropriate thing 
all the time.

149
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,380
That's what it is.
The way it guy becomes a comic is all 

150
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:20,380
your life.
People have been telling you to shut up.

151
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,620
That's mean.
Don't say that.

152
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,490
You know,
you're,

153
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,530
you're looking at it the wrong way and 
you know,

154
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,930
get a job.
That's what everybody tells comics.

155
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,050
So once they become actual comics,
they just can't wait to do what they're 

156
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,991
not supposed to do all the time.
They just want to pull their ticket out 

157
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:34,991
all the time.
They want to say stupid shit.

158
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:39,611
They want to sing on the airplane.
And Joey did that weird man talk about 

159
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:41,930
that because that was.
I thought we were going to jail.

160
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,490
I thought we really going to jail.
That was setting this up for,

161
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,790
you know what's crazy?
Explain what happened.

162
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,620
We were on a plane.
We've done this twice.

163
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,880
We were on a plane and Joey says that 
he's with the band 10 foot screws and 

164
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,990
would like to get on the PA relate to on
the PA and sing a song for everybody.

165
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,820
This is how high we are when we fly.
Okay.

166
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,970
I mean he gets on the fucking pa one,
two,

167
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:08,570
one,
two,

168
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,600
ladies and gentlemen.
And he started to break it into 

169
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,461
notorious B I g but with no swears and 
no one knows what to do and there's 

170
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:18,550
people like staring at the kids and they
and now say like fuse,

171
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,620
ladies and gentleman,
we have a short presentation by the 

172
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:23,620
band.
10 foot screws.

173
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,970
Yeah.
Then they just let us do it.

174
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,510
Everyone on the plane was sitting there 
like,

175
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,150
I shouldn't even say us because if joe 
he goes to jail.

176
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:32,720
I do not want to go down with you.
I shouldn't have been saying I'm against

177
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:33,980
it.
And we was totally against.

178
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,580
I guess that you guys are just sitting 
there like what is going on?

179
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,770
I couldn't believe you not only did it 
there,

180
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:41,060
you did it coming back.

181
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,150
You did it on two different flights and 
these are jets.

182
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,180
These aren't like propeller plane.
This is going to remember the mother 

183
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,661
that was sitting next to us,
the meat and the kid was laughing and 

184
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:52,661
smiling at church camp.
Mom was.

185
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:57,470
Yeah,
church and the girl was like 12 and 

186
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:57,470
she's just looking at the camera because
I'm filming it.

187
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,320
She's looking at the camera like he,
he,

188
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,140
he.
This is not,

189
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,010
you know.
And you're talking,

190
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,950
you're rapping over a PA.
That poor kid was loving the chaos.

191
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:07,940
Wasn't seen post nine slash 11 to 11.
What was it?

192
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,150
Two thousand four.
Something like that.

193
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,840
You can find it online.
What was that Joe Show?

194
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,900
If you Google Joe show.
Joey Diaz ready to die yet.

195
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:18,380
That's what it is.
That it is ready to die on youtube.

196
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,510
Got One's genius.
That's the best one.

197
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,140
Talking monkeys in space or DVD.
That's out right now on Amazon.

198
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,690
Oh yeah,
yeah.

199
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:27,440
That.
That's in the video you made,

200
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,450
right?
It's called a talking monkeys in 

201
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,691
Columbus.
It's one of the DVD extras on the 

202
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:36,500
fucking PA on two planes.
Not just talk,

203
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:41,480
sang songs and had stewardesses clapping
along and it was fucking weird.

204
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,460
It was weird.
That was weird that they let us.

205
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,380
After 9:11.
He just met with it.

206
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,360
They just went with.
How does it weave even know?

207
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,740
How did she know?
I don't know,

208
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:51,530
but it was not American Airlines.
What was it?

209
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,780
Oh yeah.

210
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,360
I think they should have people do shit 
like that more often.

211
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:10,361
Some girl got on the airplane the other 
day in Canada and Air Canada and sang a 

212
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:11,870
song like some funny song about your 
luggage.

213
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,300
It was pretty funny,
you know,

214
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:18,301
and she was pretending that she was 
trying out for Canadian idol and 

215
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:18,301
everybody gives her a big round of 
applause.

216
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:18,340
Come on.
Really?

217
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,580
He's just really,
really gonna sing.

218
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,010
And she got on the PA and this little 
funny song prepared.

219
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,000
It was great.
It was fun.

220
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,730
What do you mean?
It was.

221
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,980
Everybody has to be quiet,
you know,

222
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:29,600
and once you shut your ipad off,
it should be anything goes.

223
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,000
But nobody breaks the in a flight late 
me.

224
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:36,060
One time we flying it next to Joe Rogan 
was fucking brock.

225
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:41,210
The fights,
those four day fucking protein shake 

226
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,981
that.
The one where you were watching the 

227
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:45,440
Antonio banderas thing that you kept 
waking know if it was a nightmare.

228
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,470
I was writing to while I was writing.
He was farting and I put it in the blog 

229
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,130
and his heart was so bad.
I had to put it in the blog entry.

230
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,260
That was the happy pills.
I do not miss that because I mean ms dot

231
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,680
that was really big protein all the time
and he was always like a man handled 

232
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,370
like you'd been at and he would like 
literally tortured me with fucking worse

233
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,720
than my father was the one that the 
bookstore and Houston when I fought it 

234
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,640
and it bounced off the library shelves 
on the second floor.

235
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:20,320
Oh,
fuck it up.

236
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,500
What was the name of that bookstore and 
Houston dog.

237
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,780
Oh,
you talking about?

238
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,400
He was sitting in a chair like,
we're read a magazine.

239
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:32,310
Fuck Joe Diaz.
That's still not as good as tate's at 

240
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,180
the comedy store in San Diego.
The comedy store in La Jolla.

241
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,460
He farted in the law.
It was like somebody lit it on fire.

242
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,350
People were running from it,
man.

243
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,410
They were running from it.
That was when we were standing by the 

244
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:45,410
door.
Yeah,

245
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:45,410
no,
it was.

246
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:45,690
Yeah,
same weekend.

247
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,140
He farted right by the door and like ran
towards the bar.

248
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,510
His faults had this,
this a robot in the middle of the fart.

249
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:58,530
Like first you get a hold of the Fart,
joke around you for like four or five 

250
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,671
seconds.
Then this complete other things will 

251
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:03,460
evolve.
That would just climb into your nose has

252
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,720
and you had to step out of that fucking 
zone and then when you came back into 

253
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,340
that zone,
you still smelled a fart in a postmortem

254
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,710
type way.
It was bad,

255
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:16,100
but not really.
It is flush with fucking real bad.

256
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,240
He said he ain't bars.
Okay.

257
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:17,970
The chemical.
Now,

258
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,560
Omar,
he's farsighted.

259
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:21,190
Better credit credit rating than me.

260
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,490
Oh my God is far to a fucking thick.
Like you could smell the root of the 

261
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,420
fucking asshole.
Like,

262
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,130
Oh God.
They were living space and he would 

263
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,311
laugh his ass off.
He would turn bright red with laughter 

264
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:36,910
because part of it was he thought it was
funny and part of it was shame.

265
00:11:36,911 --> 00:11:40,240
It was all mixed together with horror 
because everybody was dying,

266
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,400
screaming,
I don't care what you say.

267
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:47,401
This part of you.
No one's comfortable with smell and 

268
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:47,830
pretend all you want,
man.

269
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,470
You can cut the kind of far to.
This dude would cut.

270
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,050
Oh my God.
You really never experienced anything.

271
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,710
It.
It's like,

272
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,600
unless you've been around a dude like 
that,

273
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,370
it's like pointless to talk to people 
about it,

274
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:57,820
but like,
yeah,

275
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:58,690
yeah,
farts stink,

276
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,810
but you don't understand.
This is fucking gas warfare.

277
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,380
It was like a salt.
You have a kid.

278
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,350
When I was growing up front of bosses,
pseudo his family owned the restaurant,

279
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,220
bns fucking ferny bosses.
Pseudo.

280
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,290
It was Puerto Rican and Cuban.
His mother may workshops every day you'd

281
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,190
go in there and destroy your fucking 
stomach.

282
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:23,790
Bernie had the same type of farts as 
take a complete different animal of 

283
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,691
Florida that grabs you.
It's just like you have to go home and 

284
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:28,720
change your shirt.
Oh,

285
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,790
intake would light would light up in the
airplane.

286
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:38,791
You could hear people in like 20 rows 
back on Jesus and you will look back and

287
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,900
take with his headphones on sunglasses.
It was a big smile on his face.

288
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Fucking chewing gum and ripping the most
horrendous force known to man up against

289
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:57,640
anyone that's ever lived a tough time 
with Antonio banderas.

290
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,740
Oh,
when I followed it and go,

291
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,110
oh my God,
put them in blog.

292
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,790
Oh,
I put it in the blog.

293
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,630
I was in the middle of writing and just 
add it.

294
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,850
I know where I see joey do this.
Just lean away from me a little bit.

295
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,140
Just a little lean.
And when Joey.

296
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,340
Oh No.
As soon as I realized what he's doing,

297
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,350
just clearing away you cartoon lifting 
up and emotions and stuff like that.

298
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,450
I do that all the time.
Actually went up by myself.

299
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,110
Do you mean not?
Unless I want you to know I'm farming,

300
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:31,310
you know,
if I'm trying to sneak out a fart and I 

301
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:31,310
take the blame for it,
which I do occasionally,

302
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,230
then I'll just sit still.
Have you ever touched?

303
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:37,790
Oh fuck.
In the shower and made Donald Duck 

304
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:37,790
Donald Duck,
I inhaled that far.

305
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,210
There's something very satisfying about 
farting in a pool or a bathtub as well.

306
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,630
The Irvine Improv and I thought you 
would get too high on the wall and you 

307
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:49,630
think like,
I was watching you and I'm like,

308
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,150
ain't nobody walking by me and I cut him
off.

309
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:57,210
I turned around a waitress,
spray a fucking glasses and I'm like 

310
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,900
four girls and they know it's you.
Fuck you.

311
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:02,770
The only thing next to a smell of Shit 
and saying it's 20 feet.

312
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,410
That's a terrible feeling.
When someone walks up,

313
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,090
he just didn't plan it out.
He thought you were in the.

314
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:13,310
In the Solo.
One time I went to Bob Hope Medical 

315
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,850
Center and they did an ekg on me and as 
they will pick me up,

316
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,950
it's a small office.
As they were picking me up,

317
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:23,190
a little came out of my ass.
I just went to the doctor and the nurse 

318
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,880
just sit there and looked at each other 
and I got up real quick.

319
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:26,740
Then block them.
Let me tell you something.

320
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,380
When you find a little doctor's office 
and they kept expanding,

321
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,740
it was one of those tait farm and so 
they just kept getting sicker when they 

322
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:34,740
know it's you,
which fucking embarrassed.

323
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,590
You know,
what I think is interesting,

324
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,680
the whole the idea,
especially amongst comics that you're 

325
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,590
not supposed to talk about farts that 
somehow another far Taylor.

326
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,670
It's like a cheap laugh on stage.
Is it even a cheap?

327
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,870
I mean it.
Is it not a part of how you look at the 

328
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,040
world mean farts are in.
They're in the mix.

329
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,740
I get,
I guess it's like airplanes.

330
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,280
Uh,
if it's about farts,

331
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,170
it's been said airplanes.
You know,

332
00:14:57,171 --> 00:15:01,480
patent did a Joe Patton Oswald did a 
joke on his latest cd about going on jet

333
00:15:01,481 --> 00:15:06,481
blue.
It's an airplane choke and I fucking 

334
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:08,441
loved it.
It's an airplane joke about all the 

335
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:08,441
Europeans,
like a sky bus.

336
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,860
Now I don't care if it's a subject 
that's been beaten.

337
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,990
I want to hear your take on the subject.
I agree.

338
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,350
Yeah.
And Patents Joking airplanes in Lucy Kay

339
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,580
did one recently on Conan,
I think right now.

340
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,750
Who did you do it on it and he did like 
a whole.

341
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,150
Was It on Leno?
Might've done online.

342
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,050
You know,
it's funny though is that we are talking

343
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:26,960
about fart talking about farts and 
airplanes,

344
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,480
but yet we just got done talking about 
farting on airplanes.

345
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,740
That's fascinating.

346
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,630
What is it?
What I was going to say is what is about

347
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:37,150
like things like farts where like,
you know,

348
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:42,151
if you talk about it,
it's like a cheap laugh and a lot of 

349
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:42,151
times it is a cheap laugh like bad 
comics,

350
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,430
but when it's telling the truth,
you know,

351
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,470
when it's you,
you've talked about farts on stage 

352
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:49,850
before and had to be fucking crying 
laughing.

353
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,060
It's the truth.
If anybody's smelled tate's Farts,

354
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,480
you will look at far.
It's completely different and it 

355
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:58,480
wouldn't be a hacky situation.
Well it's,

356
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,741
it's.
I mean it's still one of those things 

357
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:02,741
where you think a lot of comics are 
always worried about what other people,

358
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:04,760
especially other comics think about 
their material,

359
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,530
so they're scared to talk about 
anything.

360
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:08,060
Even if it's something they're really 
thinking about.

361
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:10,730
If it's like a tired premise,
they don't want to talk about it.

362
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,970
Even if it's,
you have your own unique point of view 

363
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:15,970
on it,
they just don't want to touch on it.

364
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:15,970
But I don't think that's good either.
Man.

365
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,740
I think you give,
if you give yourself any restrictions,

366
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,440
I mean you can be dwelling on the 
dumbest fucking thing in the world,

367
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:23,990
like the most obvious premise,
but if you're actually dwelling on it,

368
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,290
you should even address the fact that 
this is obviously a stupid premise.

369
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,150
Why am I fucking obsessed with this?
But you know,

370
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,010
that's like when you start cutting out 
subjects and like fucking,

371
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,040
you know,
like how many comics played the back of 

372
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,040
the room,
right?

373
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,490
How many comics do comedy instead of,
for their own,

374
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:45,491
like their own personal viewpoint.
They do it so that other comics will 

375
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:45,491
like them.
You know?

376
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:48,380
I mean how many guys remember,
remember in the beginning open mic days,

377
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:53,381
there were dudes would only make comics 
laugh and a lot of guys that got stuck 

378
00:16:53,381 --> 00:16:55,760
in this weird spot where they all their,
their audience was comics.

379
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,350
It would be good at making comics lap,
but regular audience members,

380
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,330
which is,
you know,

381
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,020
the comics wanted to see something 
fucked up.

382
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,320
Oh,
hi.

383
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,670
Joe Just kicked in and he sat back at 
whatever.

384
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,200
Joey sits back.
Let me tell you something.

385
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,350
Whatever Joey says,
bag like this and crosses his fingers on

386
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:16,270
his chest.
He's fucking gone.

387
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:21,570
He's gone.
He's on another planet right now with 

388
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:21,570
the acupuncture and then got stone and 
we smoked that stuff.

389
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:26,371
You hadn't.
That put me right the fuck over the 

390
00:17:26,371 --> 00:17:26,371
wall.
Do you worry?

391
00:17:26,371 --> 00:17:27,460
Do you ever think about like what you're
talking about on stage or do you just,

392
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,960
you just write out what you're thinking 
about?

393
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:30,370
Like do you ever look at it and go,
hmm,

394
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,800
maybe this isn't a subject for me.
Maybe I shouldn't touch this.

395
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:39,670
It's maybe three subjects that won't 
touch on stage just because of personal 

396
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,830
references and I'm a failure for not 
touching them.

397
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,280
Really.
You feel like a failure for not touching

398
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,330
them because I'm letting my emotions get
involved.

399
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,440
I don't like abortion.
That's a tough.

400
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,380
That's a tough subject.
I don't like kids with AIDS and punching

401
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:58,020
kids.
I'm not a big fan of that either.

402
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:03,830
I've talked,
I've said shocking shit like that 

403
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,830
before.
That was mean and funny,

404
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,881
but because it's a weakness to be able 
to go off and cover every spectrum of 

405
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:09,570
life.
Right.

406
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:12,890
But maybe you just don't find humor.
I don't find humor.

407
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,030
I want to talk about a rape.
I don't ever.

408
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,600
I told you about fucking people they 
asked that he has.

409
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,170
I've never mentioned the word rape.
Rape makes my fucking neck hair stick up

410
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,380
every time.
So that's,

411
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,740
you know.

412
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,440
Well then that's just you though is you.
There's no reason.

413
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,470
I don't think so,
man.

414
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,580
I don't think so.
I'm thinking.

415
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,360
I think,
you know,

416
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:34,890
you talk about what you want to talk 
about.

417
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:39,891
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with that shit on get it.

418
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,150
I put it on the truth about going to 
prison,

419
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,240
but I just cannot talk.
Cooktop,

420
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:47,660
holding the guy down with a machine gun.
You.

421
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,000
I totally understand what you're saying.
Yeah.

422
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:52,860
It's a tricky.
It's a tricky situation,

423
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,240
man.
Who Does it?

424
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,920
You know,
what gets me about abortion?

425
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,720
Here's what gets me about the abortion 
subject.

426
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,640
It's like there's two sides,
okay,

427
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:02,250
and there's one sign where you are,
you know,

428
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:07,251
you're a pro life and you don't think 
that people should be allowed to have 

429
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:08,370
abortions and that there's other options
and that it's killing it's murder.

430
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,800
And then the other side is,
you know,

431
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:14,050
you support a woman's right to choose 
and it's just a sick.

432
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:19,130
It's just a series of cells in the body.
It doesn't have a sole woman she's 

433
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,160
carrying in our body.
It should be totally up to her.

434
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,830
Why doesn't have to be just two,
two points of view.

435
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,480
I see both.
I see.

436
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:25,860
I should not be able to tell you what to
do.

437
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,920
I should not be able to tell anybody 
what to do and I could totally see 

438
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:30,920
wanting to have an abortion.
You know?

439
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,190
I could totally see not wanting to raise
a child at certain points in your life.

440
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:37,191
I,
I could totally see you having that 

441
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:37,191
option.
But let's be honest,

442
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:37,350
what you're doing is you're killing 
something.

443
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,420
You know,
you got each growing inside you,

444
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,370
but it will eventually become a human 
being.

445
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:41,990
You know?
I mean,

446
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,130
we can,
we can play games and say,

447
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:44,940
you know,
at three days,

448
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:49,941
and it's not at five days,
it is or whatever the fuck you want to 

449
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:52,431
say,
but the bottom line is there's a little 

450
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:54,021
human being growing inside your body and
I think you should be able to do 

451
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:54,021
whatever the fuck you want.

452
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:54,021
I mean,
it's your body.

453
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:55,430
I really don't think anybody could tell 
you.

454
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,640
You know,
but that's,

455
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,960
you're killing something mean you're,
you're choosing not to let it grow.

456
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,410
You're,
you're terminating it.

457
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,110
I mean,
let's be honest about what you're doing.

458
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,350
It's a symbiotic relationship.
Obviously the baby needs you to stay 

459
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,501
alive.
It's a part of you until it becomes its 

460
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:12,660
own individual entity.
But the path has been set.

461
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,950
It's on the way,
you know.

462
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,810
Why is that?
Like how come you can't say that?

463
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,090
I mean everybody you got,
it's either one or the other.

464
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,820
Either you support a woman's right to 
choose or you know,

465
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,470
you think it's murder,
but no one ever says,

466
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,630
well,
I support the right for you to do it,

467
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:26,340
but let's talk about what the fuck it 
is.

468
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,580
I mean,
it is a creepy thing and if I was a 

469
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,231
woman it would creep me out,
but I would have to do something like 

470
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:33,231
that.
You know,

471
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:33,231
especially when you talk to someone 
who's had kits,

472
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,700
once you've had kids,
you understand what,

473
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,300
what babies really are and the whole 
thing,

474
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,110
you know,
you get,

475
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,930
you get this experience of having your 
own child,

476
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,830
you know,
and you go,

477
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,660
oh wow.
It's crazy.

478
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:45,510
The abortions really crazy when you 
think about it.

479
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,250
I'm glad I don't have the option.
I'm glad

480
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,870
you know that I don't get pregnant.
Could you imagine if it was you that got

481
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,950
pregnant if like,
you know,

482
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,000
like a bar.
How many abortions would you have?

483
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,650
You'd have to,
you'd have like 10 abortions.

484
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,660
I mean,
can you have your fucking plumbing break

485
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,790
a ceiling to this?
I went,

486
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,950
I went out with a girl once that it 
sends so many abortions that she can't 

487
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:07,950
get pregnant.
Really?

488
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,480
Say three or four.
She was so crazy.

489
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,050
I,
you know,

490
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,120
I went to this,
she's had,

491
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,130
she's had like five or six.
She,

492
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:19,140
so she was so crazy.
I went to this abortion or a show or 

493
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,160
whatever it was at the Science Museum.
I guess it wasn't a show convention.

494
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,390
No,
it was just a display that showed from 

495
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,460
like every week of a baby's life that 
meet thing,

496
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:35,461
that life thing.
Bodies in motion and they're all in 

497
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:35,950
glass jars though and there.

498
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,900
And at first I was like,
they're not real.

499
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:42,901
These are just little models.
But then you read down that these are 

500
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:42,901
all real.
Start calling the mother.

501
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:47,300
Yeah.
And you look at the very small one and 

502
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:47,530
it looks like a little demon.
Like I don't know if you've ever seen it

503
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:49,570
just looks like an alien or something.
Lizard.

504
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:50,740
Yeah.
And then it just,

505
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,500
it's so weird seeing a girl,
but then you get to the big one and that

506
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:56,380
is the most depressing thing you'll ever
see in your life.

507
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,500
Just as baby sitting there with a face 
that's been frozen in time.

508
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:00,580
Like and just,
you know,

509
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,050
it freaks me out and if you don't know 
the exhibit we're talking about,

510
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:10,051
it's a bodies exhibit and this guy 
invented some new process of preserving 

511
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:13,750
human tissue and he does it somehow or 
another in plastic and they have a whole

512
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:14,500
video on it.

513
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:20,550
I think it's called body worlds,
but I'm trying to think of the process 

514
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:24,151
plasta something anyway,
so it's really like a bunch of bodies 

515
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:28,600
all cut up in like in weird positions 
doing weird things and you know,

516
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:33,601
it gives you a sense of the anatomy,
but it also gives you a sense like how 

517
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:34,600
is this any different than something a 
fucking serial killer would do?

518
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,970
You know?
Actually,

519
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:41,810
could you imagine that this was all 
started by a guy who's just some sick 

520
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:46,351
fuck.
And the way he pawned it off on people 

521
00:22:46,351 --> 00:22:49,120
is like just checking out the anatomy 
because there's some of them that are so

522
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:49,840
questionable.
Dude,

523
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,870
one of them,
they had a chick cut in half at the 

524
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,890
vagina and the vagina and there's 
segments of her.

525
00:22:56,891 --> 00:22:59,620
She's like cut in half at her fucking 
pussy.

526
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,560
Like really tiny.
I really need to see that.

527
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,390
Are you sure?
Are you sure about that?

528
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:05,560
You sure you want to put that fucking 
image?

529
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:07,690
Pretty fucking demented.
It's weird,

530
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:09,790
man.
They're like playing tennis and Shit and

531
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:14,791
you know,
it's just their muscle tissue with no 

532
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:14,791
skin on it.
Fake eyeballs.

533
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:15,850
It's a trip.
Do we go together to see?

534
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,160
I think we did and we saw the imax movie
a body,

535
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:23,250
the body gangs.
I remember being so stoned while seeing 

536
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:23,280
that I almost had a panic attack and had
to.

537
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,060
We were so hot.
We had lollipops,

538
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:26,270
didn't we?
I think we had lost.

539
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,870
This was back in the days.
The rookie days of of edibles will.

540
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,780
We didn't quite understand what was 
going on.

541
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,320
They go to lollipops will be fine.
We didn't know the people who don't 

542
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:37,330
know.
When you eat pot man,

543
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:39,340
you get.
You get way different.

544
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:44,460
It's a way different high.
It's something called 11 hydroxy 

545
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:44,620
metabolites produced by your liver.
We've talked about it before,

546
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:46,100
but that's why people freak

547
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,120
out when the brownies and shit like you,
you.

548
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:53,190
You swore off edibles on Mondays because
the Armenians given me free editable day

549
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:58,241
on Monday,
so I always eat three peanut butter 

550
00:23:58,241 --> 00:23:58,710
cookies and get fucked up.
Once you call,

551
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,550
we will never forget this.
You go like this dog.

552
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,950
That's it.
That's it.

553
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:05,390
Dog.
I got one.

554
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,200
No more fucking had apples.
Apples.

555
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:13,010
Joe Rogan.
I'm done.

556
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,460
I'm done.
Bed had Tivo.

557
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,890
So you feel like you could just record 
this.

558
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,970
The recording would be awesome,
but would be more awesome as the visual,

559
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,040
you know to get some facetime.
Facetime.

560
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:30,050
It's always doing facetime.
Sometimes you eat those edibles and I 

561
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:30,890
them like eight in the morning.
Guys like I get up,

562
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,760
have a cup of coffee,
either fucking chocolate cake by 9:30.

563
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:38,390
I gotta go rewind.
Fear factor was all edibles because that

564
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:43,391
would last the longest.
And this is also when I didn't 

565
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:43,391
understand,
I just knew that I build up a tolerance.

566
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:46,790
If I had a lollipop every day I was 
getting blitz greed.

567
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,390
I mean like so baked.
I was like freaking out about the colors

568
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:55,391
of the sky and you know,
thinking how strange this life is and 

569
00:24:55,391 --> 00:24:56,000
we're pretending it's permanent,
but it's really temporary.

570
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,940
While it was like forced to do this,
not forced,

571
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:03,941
but you know,
while my job was to do this fear factor 

572
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:06,320
show hightest Fox,
if they fuck with you,

573
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:07,400
those edibles,
you know what I'm saying?

574
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,170
Yeah.
No,

575
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,580
they do really do it.
It's way stronger.

576
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,730
People don't.
It's four times more psychoactive than 

577
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:15,730
thc.
When you eat it,

578
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,110
that 11 hydroxy metabolite,
it doesn't feel like pod.

579
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,140
Does it feel like you're high.
It feels like some totally different 

580
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,490
kind of a psychedelic trip,
you know,

581
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,220
very introspective,
you know,

582
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:27,110
really makes you fucking consider your 
life.

583
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:29,120
You know,
when you're alone and you ate a Brownie,

584
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,790
you start going deep into your childhood
and Shit,

585
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,660
don't you thinking about like your 
relationship with your parents and 

586
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,591
fucking all sorts of weird shit that 
made you become who you are and you 

587
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:42,350
start like really fucking going deep.

588
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,910
Last time I did edibles was that at UFC 
and oh,

589
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,220
it was with you.
And uh,

590
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,780
it got to the point where there was a 
good match going on and everyone was 

591
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:53,780
murmuring,
you know,

592
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,950
at once,
like an arena started that murmur 

593
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,490
started to get in me and I start feeling
my heart,

594
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,050
Ms.
Clay,

595
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,140
Guido Diego Sanchez.
I could feel the smacks was one flurry 

596
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,330
of the first round where they were both 
just look for like a minute,

597
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,060
they must have connected on 20 punches a
piece.

598
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,450
I felt all 20 punch.
I remember that I woke up like this,

599
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:20,380
like just holding onto myself like I 
can't even walk these fucking punches.

600
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:25,381
That Diego's thrown at me and all of 
sudden I realized I had Brian Redman 

601
00:26:25,381 --> 00:26:28,751
next month.
And people like jake shields is over 

602
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:28,751
here.
I'm like,

603
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:31,890
what's happening?
But I caught myself fucking blocking 

604
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,740
Diego's body kicks the shit like twisted
and everything.

605
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,760
That's what,
you know,

606
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:37,150
fuck three d glasses.
When I was in that bucket,

607
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,620
when they broke,
that was a,

608
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,440
that was a very intense first minute if 
you remember.

609
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,160
That's what think about edibles.

610
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,470
It swept you.
It just swept me.

611
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,890
I'm like turning and fucking fading and 
you know,

612
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:52,320
make it believe he was jabbing.
Here's the question.

613
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:54,030
Here's the question.
Do you think it's real?

614
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,120
Do you think that the connection that 
you have when you get super high,

615
00:26:57,121 --> 00:27:02,121
like especially with edibles,
that weird feeling that you have where 

616
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:02,250
you feel like you can tell that people 
are lying,

617
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,980
you can tell if people are upset with 
you and they're not talking about it.

618
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:07,080
If you could tell if they have issues,
I think that's real.

619
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,370
Yeah.
I think it's 100 percent,

620
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,660
100 percent.
It's real,

621
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:14,661
right?
There's a different level of perception 

622
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:17,421
that comes.
It's like you have a new sense that you 

623
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:19,311
usually don't have,
but when you get sober you all of a 

624
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:21,981
sudden start thinking it's ridiculous 
when you sober up because you're not 

625
00:27:21,981 --> 00:27:21,981
feeling the same sense and.

626
00:27:21,981 --> 00:27:25,840
Exactly,
but it doesn't mean it's never more 

627
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,581
ridiculous.
There is no more ridiculous story than 

628
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:30,951
you're telling someone that you have an 
enlightened perspective because you got 

629
00:27:30,951 --> 00:27:31,860
intoxicated.
People will always make fun of that.

630
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:32,540
Like,
Oh yeah,

631
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:32,880
yeah,
yeah.

632
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,930
You're high on mushrooms and you figured
it out the world.

633
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,100
Sure you did.
You know,

634
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,730
because when you're sober it seems so 
preposterous,

635
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:44,030
but when you're really,
really high you can see some shit and 

636
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,141
you figure out some shit.
Every time you get high you get getting 

637
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:48,150
your car.
Even if it's just go to starbucks,

638
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,520
you always figure out one component of 
your day,

639
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,790
like one decision is made and it's made 
you know,

640
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,840
and you stick to it.
Since that we'd every reason why people 

641
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,850
think it makes you paranoid.
It's making you think about shit.

642
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,730
It's making you consider shit that you 
don't ordinarily consider.

643
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,850
And let me tell you something.
We'd in the isolation tank,

644
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,400
my God,
Joey Diaz,

645
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:11,130
that fucking thing has changed my whole 
brain.

646
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,050
It's rewired my brain.
Like I,

647
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:16,020
I have like all the hardware from my old
brain.

648
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,360
It's still like laying around,
but it's not even connected anymore.

649
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,910
That fucking isolation tanks and just 
smoking weed.

650
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:26,150
I'm trying to figure out how to live my 
life as if like I just entered into this

651
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:32,571
world like 10 years ago.
I entered into a body that's already 

652
00:28:32,571 --> 00:28:36,111
existed and already had a history and 
already had a bunch of things that it's 

653
00:28:36,111 --> 00:28:36,300
already done and dealt with,
and so what have I done?

654
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:37,530
I've done all this.
Jesus Christ.

655
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:39,000
What was I thinking when I did that?
You know what I mean?

656
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:41,970
It's like become a totally different 
human being.

657
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,410
Managing like a new life.
That's what like the tank does to you.

658
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,870
The tank is the fucking freakiest thing 
ever.

659
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:50,550
I wish more.
You guys would be into it.

660
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,710
You know nobody.
Nobody does it.

661
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:54,690
I don't know why you guys wouldn't do 
it.

662
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,280
It's I,
I always talk about it.

663
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:59,580
It is the craziest fucking experience 
that I ever do.

664
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,890
It's like doing a crime and going home 
and locking your door to smoking a joint

665
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,920
for eight hours.
Sitting there thinking the cops are 

666
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:08,920
going to break in.
That's a horrible feeling.

667
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,950
You get to see fucking life.
Whether it is when you sit in that 

668
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,680
corner listening by the stairs to see if
they come in.

669
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,800
It's a fucked up experience.
You think,

670
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,910
well,
you clean your brain out of all the shit

671
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:22,911
that you've done that's making you worry
about people coming to get you all that 

672
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:22,911
shit.
All the shady shit,

673
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:24,510
you know,
it makes you clean your brain out.

674
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,730
How come you've never done the tank?
How come you never go in?

675
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,220
I don't fit.
You fit.

676
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,710
There's a giant one.
They have the guy in Venice can make any

677
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:34,000
size one.
It's a huge door,

678
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,120
Joe.
It's not like you have to.

679
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,440
There's two places.
One is soothing solutions in Burbank.

680
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:44,480
You could go that's near you real close 
and it's a very nice lady.

681
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,230
Death Squad trip and tape it over there 
and see what happens.

682
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,860
Let's do it.
Shit.

683
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,560
She's a nice lady.
She's very nice.

684
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,250
Yeah,
let's do it.

685
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:52,600
I'll do it with you guys.
Let's do this.

686
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,620
Tape it and see what happened.
Make a video.

687
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,680
I feel when I'm taking you guys all 
Eddie to and already to.

688
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,380
Let's see how I was going to fuck it up.
Don't start screaming.

689
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,900
He's faking it.
No,

690
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,730
no,
he wouldn't.

691
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,550
If we just all said,
let's,

692
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:14,610
let's all have an experience that we can
advertise that lady's business too and 

693
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:19,250
the guy in Venice to let's advertise him
too because his place is share.

694
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,110
Is it really bad for labs to shit that 
guy his.

695
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:27,111
He's on another level.
See everybody else's making these tanks 

696
00:30:27,111 --> 00:30:27,111
like my old tank,
the one I gave away,

697
00:30:27,111 --> 00:30:27,220
which is excellent.

698
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,930
I mean it's better way better than 
nothing.

699
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,980
You know,
it's good.

700
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:34,981
It works good.
But his are like super thick steel and 

701
00:30:34,981 --> 00:30:39,001
insulated and his like maintain 
temperature much better and it's much 

702
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:43,110
bigger so you have more oxygen inside of
it and he actually adds an oxygen 

703
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,110
pumper,
you know,

704
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,920
an oxygen scrubber.
So it scrubs oxygen,

705
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:46,750
pure oxygen out of the air and pumps it 
into you.

706
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,460
He's just got it down.
He's like,

707
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,240
he's nuts.
I had to float that Dotcom.

708
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,470
He's crazy dude.
But a cool.

709
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,500
The cool kind of crazy and it was like a
mad scientist and he's got this new 

710
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,500
thing that I tell you about the new 
thing,

711
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,610
the video cameras.
This motherfucker,

712
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:05,611
you know,
what if you don't know about the 

713
00:31:05,611 --> 00:31:07,051
isolation tank with the isolation tank 
is it's a tank that was invented by a 

714
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:10,831
guy named John Lilly.
John Lilly was this crazy psychedelic 

715
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:10,831
pioneer from the sixties.

716
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:15,570
He used to take ketamine and and fucking
lay in the tank for days like he was 

717
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:20,041
nuts.
He used to take acid and this is how I 

718
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:22,241
figured out how to make the tank.
He felt he wanted to figure out a way 

719
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:25,831
where he was completely separate from 
his senses so his brain doesn't have to 

720
00:31:25,831 --> 00:31:27,820
listen to his body at all and he first 
he started out with.

721
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:31,930
He would be in a tank where he would be 
upright and the the head you would float

722
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,600
by the head,
so basically be hanging from your chin,

723
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,780
which is probably not that comfortable,
but you get used to it and then you,

724
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,820
you know,
the rest of you feels like you're 

725
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,251
weightless.
But then he figured out all you have to 

726
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:44,251
do is just put a ton of salt in the 
water and that'll make your point.

727
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:46,540
Then you can lie on your back and then 
like half of your body's exposed,

728
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,430
so that's the new models.

729
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:53,430
They all,
they all have like minus 800 pounds of 

730
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,161
salt and 11 inches of water and you're 
lying in it and the water is 93 point 

731
00:31:56,161 --> 00:32:00,121
five degrees,
which is the same temperature as your 

732
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:01,801
skin and so as you lie in it,
you don't feel the water anymore and it 

733
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:05,430
you just dissolve.
You have no body sensation at all and 

734
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,680
it's just pure mind.
It's just the mind with no connection to

735
00:32:08,681 --> 00:32:09,670
any,
any input,

736
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,560
so the mind doesn't have any 
distractions.

737
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,680
You mind gets to look at your whole life
completely objective.

738
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:19,681
We're not thinking about your back or 
your fucking feet smell or you know 

739
00:32:19,681 --> 00:32:21,910
you're touching the couch or you're 
hearing the sounds and seeing lights.

740
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,150
It's just pure mind.
And in that state,

741
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,370
that's one of the rarest states on 
earth.

742
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,100
There's very,
I mean it's pretty simple to achieve,

743
00:32:30,101 --> 00:32:35,101
but if you think about it,
there's no place like that on earth 

744
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:35,170
where you couldn't be separate from your
body.

745
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,410
Like literally you don't feel your body.
It's just your mind,

746
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,440
you know,
and,

747
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,630
and you get destroyed.
We all get distracted.

748
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:44,880
Like it's like having a conversation in 
front of a giant crowd of people.

749
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:46,670
Like when you're on stage that's 
distracting,

750
00:32:46,671 --> 00:32:47,520
you know,
talking to people,

751
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:49,880
what people are next to you screaming,
that's distracting.

752
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But what we don't realize is life is 
distracting and sometimes you got too 

753
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,871
much.
Like why do people who have fucked up 

754
00:32:58,871 --> 00:32:58,871
lives like to have a bunch of shit going
on.

755
00:32:58,871 --> 00:33:03,130
You know how many dudes you know,
that complicate their lives on purpose 

756
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,460
because they got,
they got some shit going on so they'll 

757
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:06,460
just throw.
I'm starting up a business like the fuck

758
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,840
are you talking about?
You're starting up a business man.

759
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,470
You're a fucking comic,
you're gonna,

760
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:10,800
you're gonna start up a business.
It's,

761
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,500
but what?
Why is he really starting up a business?

762
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:17,501
He's trying to distract himself with 
more shit so he doesn't have to think 

763
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:17,501
about as shit.
You know?

764
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:21,101
It's like,
it's a classic psychological ploy your 

765
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:21,290
whole life as a distraction.
You don't even realize it.

766
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,800
Everything you do is constant input 
coming in.

767
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,460
You've got to navigate your way through 
this world.

768
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,910
It takes away resources,
takes away resources that your brain has

769
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,100
got to get in there.
Joey d is,

770
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,950
let's go burbank next week to fucking 
break.

771
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:36,590
Lets me know if you don't do it,
you have never done it

772
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,540
because I,
you know,

773
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,510
I just,
I don't know.

774
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,640
That's the thing.
It's one of those things.

775
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:47,780
So if you ever been in the tub before,
you think you avoid that kind of like 

776
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,840
heavy lifting when it comes to like the 
mind?

777
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,150
Uh,
no.

778
00:33:51,151 --> 00:33:52,380
You know,
to me I,

779
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,730
I have my own kind of relaxing things 
that I do and it seems like,

780
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,990
I don't know,
I guess it's not a necessities,

781
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,580
so I don't really need to blow money on 
something that,

782
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,960
you know,
do

783
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,460
you have to kind of be a certificate?
Was free.

784
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,070
I would do it every day.
Well let's get you on it then.

785
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,320
We're going to do that.
That's going to be our next video.

786
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:16,530
We're gonna do the isolation tank.
I'm going to convert all you guys 

787
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,171
because I think it's ridiculous that 
I've been using this thing for seven 

788
00:34:19,171 --> 00:34:21,301
years and you guys don't use it.
I'm sure it's better than a tanning bed 

789
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:22,720
and if you guys are way better jerk off 
and if you guys go to,

790
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,080
if you google where to float,
just that term,

791
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,720
there will be a website that will pop 
out from somebody,

792
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:33,721
somebody.com
which are very awesome people that made 

793
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:36,811
my first tank and their um,
their website has a listing of places 

794
00:34:36,811 --> 00:34:38,590
where you can rent time on a tank all 
over the world,

795
00:34:38,591 --> 00:34:40,990
all different countries,
all the different places it's available.

796
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:46,380
And a lot of people have used it and 
emailed me about it and said that they 

797
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:46,380
found a tank,
you know,

798
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:46,990
like an hour away from their house or 
something like that.

799
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,110
It's a fucking great tool.
It's a great tool for the mind.

800
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:55,140
You know,
if you're the type of person that likes 

801
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:55,140
to meditate and I think everyone should 
know everyone.

802
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:55,750
I mean,
you call it medical,

803
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:00,770
you say meditate.
You sound like you're full of Shit and 

804
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:00,770
you're doing yoga with beads on.
You know what I mean?

805
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:04,680
It sounds like the word meditate has 
this connotation is this,

806
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,340
you know,
this fake,

807
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,860
fake spirituality connected to it.
You know,

808
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,700
it's a term,
right?

809
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,370
But that,
but thinking about your life,

810
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,280
it's very important.
Especially in boulder,

811
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,030
they use motherfuck,
Lynn sand,

812
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:22,050
little words.
There was so many sand aware and muddle 

813
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:22,050
falls in boulder.
I tell you what though,

814
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:25,210
they're nice,
but I would talk to people and you know,

815
00:35:25,211 --> 00:35:25,990
it'd be like,
you know,

816
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,270
they would say,
oh,

817
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,980
I've got this back injury.
You know,

818
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,910
I can't go to Jujitsu.
I go,

819
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:31,750
oh,
that's cool man.

820
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:32,800
You know,
you okay.

821
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,640
You're going to be all right.
He goes,

822
00:35:33,641 --> 00:35:34,840
yeah,
I'm going to this healer.

823
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,920
He's doing a lot of body work on me.
A lot of energy work.

824
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:38,960
I'm like,
ah,

825
00:35:38,961 --> 00:35:40,320
you pay for that or do you suck his 
dick?

826
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,840
Fuck.
He talking about.

827
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,480
He was like totally straight face

828
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,230
going to a healer.
You know,

829
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,940
he's working on me doing a lot of body 
work.

830
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:48,360
He's doing,
oh,

831
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:49,800
he's doing bodywork.
Oh,

832
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:54,801
he's healing you rocks and saying 
there's a lot of people that make a 

833
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:54,801
living doing that.
Man.

834
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:58,680
They're healers.
They're like push on parts of your head 

835
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:58,680
and and claim that they healing you.
And.

836
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,030
But the thing is,
if you believe them,

837
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,500
it works.
It works.

838
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,830
That's the crazy thing is like the human
body is so fucking powerful,

839
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:09,831
but we don't know how to use it.
It's like a computer and we don't even 

840
00:36:09,831 --> 00:36:13,101
have a manual.
We're just going into the registry and 

841
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:13,101
fucking with things and you know,
we really don't know how it works.

842
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:16,100
So you can trick somebody with a placebo
and the placebo,

843
00:36:16,101 --> 00:36:17,430
it's a sugar.
It's just bullshit.

844
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:20,520
Doesn't do anything,
but because they think it's medicine,

845
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:24,450
their body fixes itself,
but nobody knows how to fix themselves.

846
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,130
It's crazy.
It's like,

847
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:28,440
could how come you can't?
The placebo method?

848
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:30,270
How come you can't just apply that on 
your own?

849
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,770
Why don't you?
Why can't you just trick yourself?

850
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,380
He can't.
So then you don't have access to that,

851
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,450
that you know,
that pure belief.

852
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,070
You don't have access to the pure 
belief.

853
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:43,071
You have to be literally.
You have to be kind of crazy to have 

854
00:36:43,071 --> 00:36:44,040
access to the pure belief that you can 
fix yourself with this magic pill.

855
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,370
That's just sugar.
It's a fucking mess.

856
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,420
Why can't we use it?
We got like.

857
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,260
It's like,
it's like a hidden part of the operating

858
00:36:52,261 --> 00:36:53,130
system.
You know,

859
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,620
you have to press like for keys at the 
same time to get to it.

860
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,420
You know?
It's fucked up,

861
00:36:57,421 --> 00:36:57,750
man.

862
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,970
No,
it's really cool to do stone.

863
00:36:58,971 --> 00:37:03,971
By the way.
I just thought of this while you were 

864
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:03,971
talking.
I don't want to lose it,

865
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,640
but I get really,
really baked eats and go into your 

866
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,120
garage and get a ladder and if there's a
like one of those lights,

867
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:13,121
like the garage lights go up through it 
with a friend and he both look at each 

868
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:14,660
other's face or you turn off the lights 
and he posts.

869
00:37:14,661 --> 00:37:19,661
They're at each other's space and then 
you wait to your eyes adjust to the 

870
00:37:19,661 --> 00:37:22,181
dark.
Then you flip the light real quick and 

871
00:37:22,181 --> 00:37:22,700
you see the other person's face like as 
a ghost that's burned into your retina.

872
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:26,540
Then he'd come down from the ladder and 
you just walk around and you'll just see

873
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:28,880
like this floating head in front of you.
How long?

874
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,770
It probably lasts a good minute and 
half,

875
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:33,020
two minutes to work with black people.
No,

876
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,520
no it doesn't.
Well,

877
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:39,580
you just,
you just see a community wall upstairs 

878
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,750
to put a light bulb on fucking crazy 
fucking ladder.

879
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,610
What am I doing?
Do I break my ankle as Casper?

880
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:47,510
The friendly ghost?
I put Angel Wings on when I call high.

881
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,620
That's too much drama to get high and 
stuff.

882
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,510
Thing that you've never experienced.
Try it out.

883
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:54,500
Why you scared?
You know what?

884
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,270
That's free.
Float tape.

885
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,320
You know what is cool as fuck when 
you're high.

886
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:02,140
The La um,
planetarium or the Griffith Observatory.

887
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Isn't that awesome?
Like when you lie back and he watched 

888
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,240
that star show.
Amazing fucking incredible man.

889
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,930
Yeah.
When I went to Hawaii and we went to the

890
00:38:13,931 --> 00:38:17,710
big island and uh,
we went up to the Keck observatory.

891
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,980
So in the top of the big island,
it's this gigantic fucking thing they 

892
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,370
have up there.
No telescope.

893
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,740
It's like one of the world's biggest 
radio telescopes.

894
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,980
The fucking view up there is insane.
You go up there every fucking star you 

895
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:36,040
see the whole Milky Way,
like you literally see the

896
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,120
stripe,
the Milky Way,

897
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,900
and like 100,000
times more stars he normally see because

898
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,580
it's way to fuck up there.
It's like 10,000

899
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:44,980
feet above sea level.
You're literally above the clouds.

900
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:47,470
You drive through the clouds to get to 
it because we were driving.

901
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:48,490
I was like,
this sucks man.

902
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:50,170
It's fucking cloudy.
We're going to get up there.

903
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:55,171
We're not gonna.
Be able to see shit and all of a sudden 

904
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:55,171
you pop up above the clouds and that's 
where the observatory is.

905
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:59,260
God Damn Beautiful.
The fucking stars are insane.

906
00:38:59,261 --> 00:39:04,261
It's the best thing you could look at.
It's the best view and we deprive 

907
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:06,280
ourselves from it because the lights 
even in la,

908
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:07,270
man,
even in La,

909
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:09,550
if they shut off all the lights,
if they shut off,

910
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:13,360
everything above you would be fucking 
spectacular.

911
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,210
It's incredible.
It's the most amazing thing.

912
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,670
Like I stood there and Hawaii looking up
going,

913
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,350
is this here all the time?

914
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,540
This is there all the time and we can't 
see it.

915
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:27,541
You know what?
We have all these stupid gay holidays 

916
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:27,541
like Valentine's Day secretaries that 
they.

917
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:31,481
Why don't they have a holiday where 
everybody has to turn off their lights 

918
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:32,320
and there's no electricity for the day?
Have it black out some knuckles.

919
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:37,350
How awesome would that?
That's the greatest idea you've ever 

920
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,740
come up with in your fucking life right 
now,

921
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,040
but you know what?
If we had everybody doing it,

922
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,130
literally there'd be nothing from the 
horizon.

923
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,870
It would be,
God,

924
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:48,850
how amazing would that be?
The earth would reset.

925
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:49,450
It'd be like,
oh,

926
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,480
that's what I wanted to go to Vegas,
and you drive and you're going to the 

927
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,780
mountains of Vegas.
They have beautiful views in Vegas,

928
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,420
but because of electricity,
all the God damn light,

929
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,270
those lights,
you don't see a goddamn thing.

930
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,970
You look up in the Vegas night,
you don't see a fucking thing.

931
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,620
He went,
imagine 20 years from now,

932
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,860
Vegas had to shut the lights from Sunday
to Thursday.

933
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:12,930
You would think of that.
You remember when the Luxor had that 

934
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:12,930
light that shot up in the sky and fuck 
it up in the highlands.

935
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,280
Crazy was so strong.
Was fucking with pilots.

936
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,120
Just the other day in la,
there's some guys were a shining a laser

937
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,860
at helicopters and they shined it on a 
police helicopter and man,

938
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:26,590
they're getting like crazy charges 
against them.

939
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:29,170
They should.
They chased them down to my responsible.

940
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:29,830
Well,
first of all,

941
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:32,730
it shouldn't be so easy to buy a fucking
laser that you can shoot up to the sky,

942
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,110
that new one that,
that could fucking burn you.

943
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,470
But the one that I got in Georgia.
Yeah,

944
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,650
that one got one or two illegal.
Totally illegal.

945
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:39,670
That's the only reason why I got it.
Good.

946
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,840
I told him it's legal.

947
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:50,180
It's like a super powerful laser that 
you can like literally go to the moon 

948
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,030
with pointing at the moon and it'll 
register on some fucking.

949
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:56,110
Some one of those Russian things.
One of those reflectors on the moon.

950
00:40:56,111 --> 00:40:57,580
Like no bullshit.
This is ridiculous.

951
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,900
Yeah.
There you can buy these super powerful 

952
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,011
laser.
That means giant takes d cell batteries 

953
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:05,011
and shit.
Wow.

954
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:05,011
Yeah.
You can just buy it,

955
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:09,580
some asshole can just sell it to some 
asphalt on top of a building and to 

956
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,650
start blinding people.
You're blind,

957
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,670
you're blind,
you're going to fuck with it.

958
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,240
I,
um,

959
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:18,310
I went outside and was putting little 
green lights on all the neighbors' 

960
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:18,310
houses,
like seeing,

961
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:18,790
like how powerful.
It was.

962
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,440
Insane.
You could see it all the way.

963
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,500
I mean literally shot a straight line 
all the way across the valley to this 

964
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,710
house that was half a mile away and I 
could see it.

965
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:31,830
Remember those little laser key chains 
that came out when like lasers first 

966
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:32,170
came out in [inaudible] 99 to the movie 
theater.

967
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:34,030
I fucking shot him on the screen.
You want to kill him.

968
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:39,030
You remember that?
That store two wheels and those guys to 

969
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,320
having those came out in myrtle beach.
Myrtle beach.

970
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,870
What was the name of that Russian dude 
that will always sell shit.

971
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,400
Every Friday.
Bones,

972
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,950
monkey ball.
I still have a bunch of his lighters,

973
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:46,550
man.
Yeah,

974
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:48,100
he had light is.
And those lights.

975
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,240
Sliders.
I just saw one the other day around 

976
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:53,240
here.
Yeah,

977
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,811
they were awesome.
He used to have these lighters flip the 

978
00:41:55,811 --> 00:41:55,811
top and these little titties would light
up.

979
00:41:55,811 --> 00:41:57,650
It was like a bikini is he's such a 
child.

980
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:02,740
Is he still around?
He's been hanging out more at the rock 

981
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:02,740
bars,
you know,

982
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,020
lately,
like the roxy and stuff like that.

983
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,000
How's he been?
See,

984
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:10,340
he's one of those dudes that even though
I wasn't like looking forward to seeing 

985
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:10,340
them when I was at the comedy store,
now that I think about it,

986
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,480
I'm like,
what a cool guy.

987
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,690
I always was nice to that guy.
Always talked to that guy.

988
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:19,870
He gave me his phone number.
The comedy store back in the day had 

989
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,620
such a unique community in that parking 
lot area.

990
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,740
You know,
that parking lot area was like a Lego 

991
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:26,740
club that we would go to.
It was like a hangout,

992
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:31,780
you know?
That was like literally half the show 

993
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,440
was the parking lot show you put on your
best shows first in the parking lot and 

994
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,910
then you started putting on your best 
shows on stage stage.

995
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,570
He used to fuck around a lot and the 
parking you became.

996
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:42,950
You became a much better comic in the 
parking lot because it was like you,

997
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:48,010
you got loose in that parking lot and 
started fucking around with us and you 

998
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:51,200
don't have any restrictions about time 
or agents watching you or managers.

999
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:56,470
You could just be yourself and you would
fucking kill everybody in the parking 

1000
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:59,441
lot and then he would take that and just
go on stage or that stage with the 

1001
00:42:59,441 --> 00:42:59,441
angle.

1002
00:42:59,441 --> 00:42:59,870
But before you were telling jokes,
right?

1003
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,700
You were like,
when you first started out,

1004
00:43:01,701 --> 00:43:03,320
you would like telling jokes on stage,
right?

1005
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,780
Like how would,
how would you look like?

1006
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,600
What was like a typical routine?
I have no fucking idea.

1007
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,250
You remember what you talked about at 
all?

1008
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:16,270
That was a long fucking time.
It was like you would go into a subject 

1009
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:16,270
but you wouldn't.
You wouldn't really go into it.

1010
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:20,640
You will get the scratch it and then you
would go to the next subject.

1011
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:21,910
That's cheating.
You didn't,

1012
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,990
you never figured out how to get that 
momentum.

1013
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,320
You know,
you get the momentum from going into a 

1014
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:29,320
subject and then really exploring that 
subject.

1015
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,470
So like,
you take the audience on a little trip.

1016
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:35,500
I know that's how I feel like when I'm 
in the audience and I'm watching a 

1017
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:35,500
really good comment and they start on a 
subject,

1018
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,100
I want them to really explore that 
subject.

1019
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,450
I'm like,
there's a lot of shit and that subject,

1020
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:43,451
let's go in there.
The best guy at that to me when I was 

1021
00:43:43,451 --> 00:43:43,451
coming up was Richard,
Jeni,

1022
00:43:43,451 --> 00:43:44,150
Richard,
Jenny.

1023
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:49,510
I got to see him a bunch of times.
I got to see him once before ever even 

1024
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:49,510
did stand up.
Uh,

1025
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:49,530
I was just,
you know,

1026
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:54,550
paying as an audience member,
I got to see him at catch a rising star 

1027
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:54,860
in Cambridge.
And it was nice because nobody even knew

1028
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:55,820
who he was back then,
you know,

1029
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:57,260
it wasn't,
wasn't even packed.

1030
00:43:57,261 --> 00:44:02,261
And I sat right on the front and the 
dude would take a subject band and just 

1031
00:44:02,261 --> 00:44:04,310
ring that motherfucker out,
wring it out.

1032
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,350
He would do a subject for like 10 
minutes.

1033
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:07,950
And then right when you thought it was 
over,

1034
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,800
Bam,
he comes up with something else and more

1035
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,260
punchlines and more.
And it was like I was in awe.

1036
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,330
I was like,
I don't think anybody does it like that.

1037
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,360
I think that guy's one of the most under
appreciated standups.

1038
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,410
It was Richard,
Jenny,

1039
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,870
you know,
a lot of people like,

1040
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:24,970
you know,
they didn't give him the credit that he 

1041
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:26,270
deserved because a lot of his premises 
were like kind of common premises,

1042
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:26,930
you know,
like,

1043
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,620
you know,
common,

1044
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:31,650
like almost like a talk show host,
a talk show host.

1045
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:32,280
But like,
you know,

1046
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:37,281
if you're doing a spot on Letterman,
like a lot of his premise is just fit 

1047
00:44:37,281 --> 00:44:37,281
right into the standard,
you know,

1048
00:44:37,281 --> 00:44:38,610
letterman spot.
But he was so good.

1049
00:44:38,611 --> 00:44:43,611
It was great.
His presence was brilliant on stage 

1050
00:44:43,611 --> 00:44:43,611
timing.
His timing was amazing.

1051
00:44:43,611 --> 00:44:45,650
Something that just,
you know,

1052
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:51,010
it's a shame.
He was in a plane with me just a couple 

1053
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:55,850
weeks before he killed himself,
just a maybe maybe a couple months or 

1054
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,030
something,
something along those lines.

1055
00:44:57,031 --> 00:45:01,110
But he was headed to Austin and we were 
headed to Austin to do a cap city comedy

1056
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:01,380
club.

1057
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,120
And he was headed there for corporate 
gig.

1058
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:08,121
And I got a chance to talk to them a 
little bit and say hi to him and he just

1059
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:09,870
like,
you wish it had more,

1060
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:14,930
you know,
but I've never really had like long 

1061
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:14,930
conversations with the dude,
you know.

1062
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:15,240
But I always felt like Richard,
Jenny is always going to be around,

1063
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:20,241
you know,
I always see him at the Improv or 

1064
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:20,241
whatever and say hi.
And he was always friendly.

1065
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:20,241
So it's like,
you know,

1066
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:20,670
you see them there and you're like,
what are you doing?

1067
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:21,630
You're going to a Gig.
Oh cool.

1068
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:22,260
Wait,
what are you doing?

1069
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:23,160
A corporate gig.
Oh cool.

1070
00:45:23,161 --> 00:45:23,460
Cool.
Yeah,

1071
00:45:23,461 --> 00:45:24,640
we're doing the comedy club.
Oh,

1072
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:25,710
all right man.
Have Fun.

1073
00:45:25,711 --> 00:45:27,330
Cool.
And that was like the conversation,

1074
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,290
you know,
it's like,

1075
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,670
man,
I wish I had talked to them,

1076
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,140
you know,
which I picked his brain.

1077
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,810
I've seen bobcat yesterday.
The doctor's office.

1078
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,180
Oh yeah.
How's he doing on the way in?

1079
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:39,090
Looks completely fucking different.
Real life.

1080
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:42,840
Like how just glasses.
Weird glasses.

1081
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,660
And I looked at him at first and he 
looked at me and he's like,

1082
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,250
on my bobcat and

1083
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:51,820
no,
he doesn't do that no more.

1084
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,070
He was a funny comment,
but it was good to see him.

1085
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,860
Bob Camp does not get

1086
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,270
back.
He deserves either because bobcat was in

1087
00:45:58,271 --> 00:46:03,271
those police academy movies,
so people didn't respect them like as a 

1088
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:03,271
comic,
but as a comic,

1089
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:05,740
bobcat was fucking hilarious.
Meet Bob.

1090
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:07,640
Do you remember that cd?
That's fucking

1091
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,260
brilliant.
Brilliant.

1092
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:12,420
I never knew he was a comic.
That was the internet,

1093
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:15,300
so I only saw him is he's still doing 
it.

1094
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:19,460
Still doing it with them like six years 
ago and talking about.

1095
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,160
He's like,
man,

1096
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,960
that's a long time.
Is he still good?

1097
00:46:21,961 --> 00:46:23,100
I mean,
how's your house sets now?

1098
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:24,810
I think he just works for Kim.
All right,

1099
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,960
so when he does stand up,
he just does it every now and then.

1100
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,070
Yeah.
Every now and then.

1101
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:31,350
We didn't even talk about that.
That's a shame.

1102
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:36,351
He was really good.
Would have benefited from the internet 

1103
00:46:36,351 --> 00:46:36,690
like crazy comedy clips or twitter at 
that time.

1104
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:41,691
Totally.
I mean he was that he was a perfect fit 

1105
00:46:41,691 --> 00:46:44,241
for the internet.
If the Internet had come along 10 years 

1106
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:44,241
earlier,
bobcat was a perfect fit.

1107
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:48,561
You imagined people's careers.
If twitter and facebook and all this 

1108
00:46:48,561 --> 00:46:49,230
shit like imagine Richard Pryor,
total prime.

1109
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:51,360
If you had a facebook page,
a twitter page,

1110
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,300
and all of them.
Kenneth mentioned Tennyson's twitter.

1111
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,010
Oh Wow.
Be every day.

1112
00:46:57,011 --> 00:46:58,790
Some copy off.
He'll fuck it.

1113
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,610
No,
that would have his twitter every day.

1114
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,840
It will be awesome.
Yeah.

1115
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:04,560
A lot of guys.

1116
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,710
I mean back then unfortunately there was
one avenue,

1117
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:10,410
there was you had to get on television,
you had to get on Hbo.

1118
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,870
That would be the big one.
Get on one of those comedy specials.

1119
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:16,740
But now there's so many avenues and so 
it's so easy now.

1120
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,150
You know,
I always think about that,

1121
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,160
like I would have been fucked if it 
wasn't for the Internet because I would 

1122
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,830
have been always labeled as like a game 
show host guy.

1123
00:47:25,831 --> 00:47:27,540
Like nobody would have taken my comedy 
seriously.

1124
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,350
You know,
you'd have to,

1125
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:29,960
you'd have to see live,
you know,

1126
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:32,320
to,
to know that I was actually comic first.

1127
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:35,710
I just took fear factor for money back 
then.

1128
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,640
But if you did like something that you 
know wasn't cohesive for a good career,

1129
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:44,820
like nobody forgive you,
you were labeled that guy and then they 

1130
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:44,820
moved onto the next thing.

1131
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,310
You know,
you wouldn't,

1132
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:49,180
you can't now because of the Internet,
you can completely express yourself.

1133
00:47:49,181 --> 00:47:51,790
Like people know exactly who you are,
like this,

1134
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:53,430
this podcast,
you know,

1135
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:58,450
I mean you can't move.
This is like the 26th one that we've 

1136
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:58,450
done.
You know,

1137
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:58,450
by that,
you know,

1138
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:03,070
people know who the fuck you are.
You are who you are and you're 

1139
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:03,970
broadcasting it back then man,
you could fake an image.

1140
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,400
You know,
you could like how many fucking gay guys

1141
00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:11,401
were straight and they decided you got 
married and everything and at the 

1142
00:48:11,401 --> 00:48:12,730
Hollywood image and the studio pushed an
image for them and they had press.

1143
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:17,731
People would talk to the press for you 
and you had a publicist and publicists 

1144
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:17,980
are fucking useless now,
as long as you're twittering,

1145
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,780
people know what you're really like,
right?

1146
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:24,781
You know,
look at Spencer Pratt and all these 

1147
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:24,781
fucking people.

1148
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:24,781
Anybody like that,
you know,

1149
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:25,540
that they become,
they become popular.

1150
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:27,850
And then they just get to talk.
You could have a million publicist,

1151
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:32,851
it doesn't matter.
Everybody's going to know eventually 

1152
00:48:32,851 --> 00:48:33,300
they're going to compile enough data to 
know exactly what you're really like.

1153
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,200
They're going to know your lows and your
highs.

1154
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,180
They're going to get them.
Make an honest judgment,

1155
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,150
you know,
like Google knows everything about us.

1156
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,060
What we were talking about this apple 
iphone thing,

1157
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:48,360
the iphone,
there's some new thing where apple's 

1158
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,420
collecting and sharing iphone users,
precise locations.

1159
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:54,720
And this is what it is,
an updated version of the privacy 

1160
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,971
policy.
The company added a paragraph noting 

1161
00:48:56,971 --> 00:48:59,481
that once users agree apple and 
unspecified partners and licensees may 

1162
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:03,700
collect and store user location data.
So I,

1163
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,380
I,
I see what you're saying.

1164
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,050
You're saying that it's totally 
anonymous and I appreciate that.

1165
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,230
But you're selling it.
You're selling data,

1166
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,330
you're collecting data on me and you're 
selling.

1167
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,540
Yeah,
please don't.

1168
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,370
Yeah,
they're there.

1169
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:21,371
Gets a point where everything,
everyone needs to make money and I get 

1170
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:21,371
that

1171
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:22,610
they're making the money that they're 
making.

1172
00:49:22,611 --> 00:49:25,640
When you're doing stuff like this,
like these ads as spammers,

1173
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,130
you're making money off spammer,
mega money off,

1174
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,780
people are going to find out where you 
are in spam.

1175
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:30,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

1176
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,350
I mean probably that's what it is and 
that's what they're doing.

1177
00:49:33,351 --> 00:49:34,430
They're trying to find out where you're 
at,

1178
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,680
where you're buying things,
what do you mind,

1179
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,670
and when you do eventually your phone is
going to be like,

1180
00:49:37,671 --> 00:49:41,300
it isn't Japan to manage your money.
It's they're trying to customize.

1181
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,220
Just like everything.
Customize your shopping,

1182
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:49,660
shopping experiences and everything.
Like we're talking about satellite 

1183
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,211
radio,
like I am a huge fan of Pandora because 

1184
00:49:52,211 --> 00:49:54,731
it kind of makes you a radio station 
based around what you like and.

1185
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:57,710
And it keeps on getting dreams off your 
phone.

1186
00:49:57,711 --> 00:49:58,410
No problem.
Right?

1187
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,030
Right.
Yeah.

1188
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:04,060
Especially the iphone.
You'd Bluetooth it right to my car and 

1189
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:04,060
it's just,
it's great.

1190
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:08,351
It's like a nonstop radio stations,
satellite radio all based right around 

1191
00:50:08,351 --> 00:50:09,720
what you like and don't like.
Right.

1192
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,570
What I was saying about the phone 
eventually becoming money in Japan.

1193
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,180
You can buy things with your phone.
You literally,

1194
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,460
I don't know if you scan it or you send 
something,

1195
00:50:18,461 --> 00:50:21,820
I don't know exactly how it works,
but it's commonplace and that's going to

1196
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:23,040
happen over here.
Eventually,

1197
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:28,090
totally not going to start sharing data 
and they know where your precise 

1198
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:28,220
locations

1199
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,220
are and you're buying things.
You're going to get spam on your 

1200
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:33,220
fullest.
She goes,

1201
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,860
I'm going to happen once you have a 
photo or wherever the fuck no where you 

1202
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:41,051
at,
but my point is that if why would they 

1203
00:50:41,051 --> 00:50:41,051
be paying for it?
If they're not going to use it,

1204
00:50:41,051 --> 00:50:41,960
if they're gonna use it.
You're going to get some bullshit.

1205
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,240
You shouldn't.
They shouldn't be able to sell your 

1206
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,720
fucking info unless it's benefiting me.
Why would your precise location benefit?

1207
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:55,740
Like the company's development?
I guess that's something that you just 

1208
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:55,740
have to be like,
well,

1209
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:55,740
hey,
they don't use it.

1210
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:59,890
Just like why would they was like a 
douchey thing that they're maximizing 

1211
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:05,051
their profit and one of the ways they're
doing it is by selling your private 

1212
00:51:05,051 --> 00:51:06,200
information,
private information.

1213
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:07,910
You just become a number.
You can become a digit,

1214
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,800
but they know exactly what you are.

1215
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,550
What kind of private information is at 
your bank account or no?

1216
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,280
Or is it.
No,

1217
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:17,750
I think precisely what I think of is 
where you go every day,

1218
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,670
what your,
um,

1219
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:22,400
what your interests are like if you call
800 fucking sex lines.

1220
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:25,430
So now one of those sex cooperation 
calls a t and t and says,

1221
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,000
we want to buy,
you know,

1222
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:30,000
names from you of people who use lines.
They just,

1223
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:30,920
well,
you know what?

1224
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:35,921
At least a t and t is working.
How many times have you gotten a call 

1225
00:51:35,921 --> 00:51:35,921
for a funeral parlor?
Ain't nobody dying with me.

1226
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:41,020
If somebody calls and says,
you want a Dick Sucking at least that 

1227
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,200
now.
And maybe that's what the fuck.

1228
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:50,070
Nobody say,
you go to vegas all the fucking time 

1229
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:50,070
from La.
What do you go to Vegas for?

1230
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:52,210
Either they get your dick suck or the 
fucking gamble.

1231
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,280
A regular consumer.
So maybe that's the data they're 

1232
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:57,340
collecting and when they sell it out to 
him,

1233
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:02,350
you know,
how many times did you get closed joe 

1234
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:02,350
from people trying to sell you 
something?

1235
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:02,350
I'm going emails.
Do you get,

1236
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:07,330
you get a lot of those calls where 
people want you to change banks and 

1237
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:08,450
interest rates and shit like that.
So how do you think they,

1238
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,100
you know,
it's stupid.

1239
00:52:10,101 --> 00:52:15,101
So somebody tells your phone number.
I don't think they saw your panel or 

1240
00:52:15,101 --> 00:52:18,751
your mother's maiden name guys.
I just think they sell your interest 

1241
00:52:18,751 --> 00:52:21,290
what you be with.
It's very annoying when someone calls my

1242
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:23,810
house and they have my name and they 
asked,

1243
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:24,800
you know,
asked me to.

1244
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,030
Joe,
are you talking about home phone?

1245
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:26,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

1246
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,160
You know what?
Home phones are dead,

1247
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:28,560
man.
I,

1248
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:33,670
I've never.
Since I got rid of my home phone like 

1249
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:33,920
five years ago,
I've never had a single stray call ever.

1250
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,450
Man.
I'm a little bit old school.

1251
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:36,980
I like to have a home phone number,
man,

1252
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:40,520
just in case I don't want to be relying 
on my cell phone.

1253
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,050
Right.
I'm a little old school.

1254
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,960
You ever go buy a car a week after you 
buy a car,

1255
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:46,890
you get an application for a credit card
with you.

1256
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,440
If that happens,
it just happens.

1257
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:50,150
I don't get back.
That bought the paper.

1258
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,390
Of course all your shit know what's the 
worst,

1259
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,140
it's where they take a car and put it in
a mall and I was like,

1260
00:52:56,210 --> 00:53:01,210
sign up the witness' car.
That is just the worst thing you could 

1261
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:04,571
possibly ever do.
Two weeks free of the fucking gym or 

1262
00:53:04,571 --> 00:53:08,070
anything like that.
Then you see anything online that you 

1263
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:08,070
can give you information about your 
fuck,

1264
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:11,360
but I always knew they were doing see 
once nine slash 11 came dog,

1265
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,230
this became more available.
That was what law was passed.

1266
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:18,770
We lost a lot of fucking freedoms that 
we don't even know we had.

1267
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,660
That's why there's people are freaking 
out,

1268
00:53:20,661 --> 00:53:22,880
but they don't know that I don't know,
but that's to do with nine slash 11,

1269
00:53:22,881 --> 00:53:26,190
but you're absolutely executive orders 
that Bush

1270
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,800
passed and Cheney pants.
A lot of freedoms pro.

1271
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,430
So this is part of the freedoms that we 
will lose that people complain about.

1272
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:37,560
I you don't know.
This couldn't have happened 20 years 

1273
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,041
ago.
That's why I used to get called from 

1274
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:40,680
Sealy posturepedic trying to sell you a 
fucking mattress and you're like,

1275
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:45,681
what are you talking about?
I don't want no matches because your 

1276
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:45,681
name just got sold.
Well,

1277
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:45,681
let me ask you this.
What,

1278
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:50,570
what do you think that.
Why do you think they concentrate on 

1279
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:53,121
taking rights away?
Do you think they concentrate on taking 

1280
00:53:53,121 --> 00:53:53,850
rights away because they're worried that
shit is eventually gonna hit the fan and

1281
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:58,851
then they're going to have to really 
figure out how to control people so 

1282
00:53:58,851 --> 00:53:58,851
they're going to have to have more 
regulations,

1283
00:53:58,851 --> 00:54:01,380
more ways to lock you up.
Why else would they be struggling to try

1284
00:54:01,381 --> 00:54:06,381
to get more control over people?
Why would they be struggling to take 

1285
00:54:06,381 --> 00:54:09,231
away your rights and liberties unless 
there's profit or unless they can 

1286
00:54:09,231 --> 00:54:11,880
control you in some sort of a time of 
great stress in disasters,

1287
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,510
just protection.
If you know,

1288
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,620
if you don't murder murder one and 
you're fine,

1289
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,740
you know,
I think they're just collecting

1290
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:21,080
not true because the government can 
absolutely target people who are enemies

1291
00:54:21,081 --> 00:54:26,081
of the government.
People have taken people out of the 

1292
00:54:26,081 --> 00:54:26,081
Green Party and put them on terrorist 
watch lists and no fly list just because

1293
00:54:26,081 --> 00:54:28,100
they protest against the war.
That's fact.

1294
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:29,900
That's already happened.
That's already done,

1295
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:33,890
so there's no way they're doing it just 
to protect you.

1296
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,920
They're doing it to profit.
They don't need to protect you like 

1297
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:38,920
that.
If they needed to protect you like that,

1298
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,821
it would be much more obvious.
Sis It at a certain point in time.

1299
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:45,800
It was like how much information is 
going to be available,

1300
00:54:45,801 --> 00:54:50,801
but about.
I mean right now I can Google Brian 

1301
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:50,801
Reichle and find out all kinds of shit 
about you.

1302
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:52,280
I can google your name.
I can google my name.

1303
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,610
When is it going to be?
Just instantly available to everybody.

1304
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:58,310
Not even a google.
You know what the.

1305
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:03,360
What the fuck is the next thing is 
available you think so if somebody is a 

1306
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,880
16 year old computer act that knows what
the fuck he's doing is available to guys

1307
00:55:07,011 --> 00:55:07,850
like me.
I'm a moron.

1308
00:55:07,851 --> 00:55:10,210
I don't know nothing about the computer,
but there's a kid right now.

1309
00:55:10,211 --> 00:55:12,080
I could press three buttons and he'll 
call.

1310
00:55:12,081 --> 00:55:14,210
You hear what your motherfucking pending
on your phone.

1311
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,830
Don't tell me you know nothing about the
computer.

1312
00:55:15,831 --> 00:55:18,740
I saw you twitter from your cell phone.
You're a monster.

1313
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:24,170
Me.
You have a twitter from your cell phone 

1314
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,200
because Brian said that's my witness 
right there.

1315
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,780
You know it's going to be crazy.
Base Times six months from now,

1316
00:55:29,781 --> 00:55:34,781
facetime hackers are going to bust into 
your phone and turn on your cameras and 

1317
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:38,561
just watch you.
Whatever is going on in your room and 

1318
00:55:38,561 --> 00:55:38,561
listen to whatever you're going to 
listen to that.

1319
00:55:38,561 --> 00:55:39,710
Uh,
I totally,

1320
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,690
totally,
totally.

1321
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:45,700
Would that be once it hits a network or 
will it be while it's on three g while 

1322
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:45,890
it's on?
I don't think it matters.

1323
00:55:45,891 --> 00:55:48,020
I don't think it matters.
I think the government could be like,

1324
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,670
you know what?
This is what we're going to do now.

1325
00:55:49,671 --> 00:55:52,370
We're going to bust,
go through a t and t network.

1326
00:55:52,371 --> 00:55:55,400
We're going to fucking use facetime with
team.

1327
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:00,640
Imagine the first fucking court case 
where somebody gets busted doing 

1328
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:00,690
something like that will come up.
Dudes.

1329
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:03,030
Dudes add keystroke things to their 
wives.

1330
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,170
Computers,
you know,

1331
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:09,290
to find out where their wife's going and
meeting up with her ex boyfriend and 

1332
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:09,290
shit like that.
You always hear things like that.

1333
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:10,350
The guy put a keystroke on skies.
Were

1334
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,110
they want to find out what you're doing?
Yeah.

1335
00:56:12,111 --> 00:56:14,690
If you have a girlfriend that's that you
want to stalk,

1336
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:19,750
you know,
here's something completely easy to do 

1337
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:19,750
that I thought of.
And why are you giving us talking?

1338
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:22,490
Now I'm just to talk to you.
I totally don't.

1339
00:56:22,491 --> 00:56:23,060
Have you ever stopped?

1340
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,400
Never.
Never,

1341
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,400
never.
When you were a young kid,

1342
00:56:26,401 --> 00:56:31,230
never drove by a girl's house.
Not like did anything out the windows

1343
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,200
in the car and cried.
Oh,

1344
00:56:34,201 --> 00:56:34,910
okay.
Okay.

1345
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,540
That's cool.
Anyways,

1346
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,390
normal.
It's.

1347
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,520
So if,
say like your girlfriend has an iphone 

1348
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:41,520
setup that,
where are you now?

1349
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,110
Location thing on her mobile.
Goodness.

1350
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,640
And then if you just log in and you know
her password,

1351
00:56:44,641 --> 00:56:47,640
you could always check on where exactly 
your girlfriend or wife is.

1352
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,920
That's just wrong.
Don't do that.

1353
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:54,921
And then,
and then you could send her messages 

1354
00:56:54,921 --> 00:56:54,921
like,
Hey,

1355
00:56:54,921 --> 00:56:54,921
I see you with him.

1356
00:56:54,921 --> 00:56:56,420
See if orange juice Jones had that 
option,

1357
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,140
that song would've never come up to you 
and him.

1358
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:03,340
I flat out busted you for a word from 
our sponsor.

1359
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:08,360
Hit it Joe Rogan.
And uh,

1360
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,230
never be the same.
Boom,

1361
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,290
boom,
boom,

1362
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:12,820
boom,
boom,

1363
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:13,360
boom,
boom,

1364
00:57:13,361 --> 00:57:15,950
boom.
You.

1365
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:20,050
I've missed you so much today.
It's just so much I followed you.

1366
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,470
Please pull that out.
Pull that up and try that.

1367
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:30,150
That is the greatest rapper of all time.
I followed you yet.

1368
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,720
You stone cold.
Busted.

1369
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,780
Close your mouth.
He says a bunch of Shit.

1370
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:35,260
What are you even saying?
Orange juice.

1371
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,290
Jones.
I saw you.

1372
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:42,530
Just press the only have one song that 
don't choose Joe.

1373
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,490
Joe was like one appearance with him on 
soul train.

1374
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:46,810
We were singing something and nobody 
remembered.

1375
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:51,811
That's it.
But I saw you and him walking through 

1376
00:57:51,811 --> 00:57:52,360
the rain is the shit.
Greatest rap song at the end.

1377
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:57,670
You and him walking.
Shut your mouth.

1378
00:57:57,671 --> 00:57:59,260
You cold flat.
Busted.

1379
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,910
Yeah.
I love you so much.

1380
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:02,500
I followed.
Was it silly rabbit?

1381
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:04,960
Trix.
If that's what gave us silly rabbit.

1382
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,130
Trix African.
Okay.

1383
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:06,640
We have it.

1384
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:07,410
Yeah.
I'm waiting for her.

1385
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:08,220
There's a commercial.

1386
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,260
Did you decide what is that?
Stop this.

1387
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:14,900
Why are they 30 seconds now?
I tolerate your 15 second commercials.

1388
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:19,900
If you give me a fucking 32nd commercial
before I watch a youtube clip with a dog

1389
00:58:19,901 --> 00:58:21,400
that's barking.
Okay.

1390
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:26,700
Some fucking ten second video.
I swear to God I will stop buying your 

1391
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:26,700
product.

1392
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:31,190
15 second commercials is good.
Stop being greedy.

1393
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,860
Thirty second.
Microsoft windows.

1394
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,830
No Jelly.
This is old old school before.

1395
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:43,510
Was it 84?
Oh yeah.

1396
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:49,110
Walking boom,
boom,

1397
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:49,650
boom,
boom,

1398
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:50,250
boom,
boom,

1399
00:58:50,251 --> 00:58:51,080
boom,
boom.

1400
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,240
Oh Shit.
You need a video.

1401
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:01,260
A video for ridiculous is what you 
people get in the afternoon.

1402
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:09,940
Can you show the video?
Do that dancing style.

1403
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:16,550
I wonder what he's doing today.
Jones Jones in Dorchester.

1404
00:59:16,551 --> 00:59:21,551
He's probably doing some some nightclub 
and apparently you got it perfect.

1405
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:33,890
Oh yeah.
People podcast.

1406
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,900
Motherfuckers.
What?

1407
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:40,901
The July baby.
Wait until he gets mad at her when he 

1408
00:59:40,901 --> 00:59:41,110
packs up all the shit.
Man.

1409
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,970
He has a conversation with her in the 
end when he breaks it down,

1410
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,010
breaks it down.
Let's a bitch.

1411
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,110
No person.
Strong pimp game.

1412
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,160
No,
no,

1413
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:50,820
no.
You don't need no.

1414
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,860
Come on man.
People can live.

1415
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,410
Look at him.
That's the real black man,

1416
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:05,420
right?
White dudes will floss with their 

1417
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:05,420
clothes like a black guy.
Does.

1418
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:11,100
Very few white guys dress like that were
fucking burgers and suits and shit like 

1419
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,170
that.
Someone's gonna come along and do that.

1420
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:17,030
What does it some white guys not wearing
like crazy suits and birds and shit like

1421
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:19,280
that.
Big fucking diamonds,

1422
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:21,380
but saying like totally white oriented 
movie.

1423
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:26,710
John Meyer.
Magic John Meyer started dressing in 

1424
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:31,620
furs and diamonds and shit.
Big Fat Pinky rings and a fucking cane 

1425
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,960
with a dragon's head on it.
A silver cane.

1426
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,880
I've been.
Why not?

1427
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:38,690
Dude?
That guy is fucked.

1428
01:00:38,691 --> 01:00:40,620
Every famous woman on the planet.
He might have.

1429
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,660
He might as well just go all out.
Just go straight pimp style.

1430
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,330
Have a bucket and diamond encrusted 
staff.

1431
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:52,360
Here it is to a Rambo,
Jamey and flat blast.

1432
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:23,730
Web W.

1433
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:33,360
pretty $700 in 1984.
Hold on my credit card.

1434
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:51,530
Yeah,
it all.

1435
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:17,650
No,
I can't give you advice.

1436
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:25,600
She's on the street now that cars 
driving by.

1437
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:39,430
Silly rabbit.
Trix kids without be let go.

1438
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,830
It's my word.
I forgot all about that.

1439
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:51,840
That was half.
That song was like r Kelly.

1440
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:53,750
Oh beautiful.
Wow.

1441
01:02:53,751 --> 01:02:54,980
That's the original art.
Kelly,

1442
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,200
who's the original art Kelly,
except Bob Kelly's.

1443
01:02:57,201 --> 01:02:58,880
Much more ridiculous.
I didn't have the Internet.

1444
01:02:58,881 --> 01:03:02,300
See they will show him pissing off.
Kelly was so much more ridiculous.

1445
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:06,440
R Kelly's the best guy sent me was 
fucking amazing.

1446
01:03:06,441 --> 01:03:08,580
Yeah.
He's yelling at us saying shit,

1447
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,440
what is it about black black culture 
where the black guy never loses and 

1448
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,760
black culture and am like,
not all obviously,

1449
01:03:16,761 --> 01:03:21,761
but in shit like this,
like these kinds of songs and like the 

1450
01:03:21,761 --> 01:03:22,430
art Kelly type songs or like superfly 
movies or something like that.

1451
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:27,670
There's something about never lose it.
You can't get me out already planned 

1452
01:03:28,461 --> 01:03:30,410
this out.
There's something about being clever,

1453
01:03:30,411 --> 01:03:35,411
like have you ever listened to the 
superfly ever watched super that one of 

1454
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:38,000
the greatest blacksploitation movie 
everlasting and is so brilliant.

1455
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,980
Um,
I took a hit on you.

1456
01:03:39,981 --> 01:03:41,870
So if anything happens to me,
you're dead.

1457
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:43,400
Like damn.
He got them.

1458
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:48,550
He got the man he planned in advance 
that something faced with garbage 

1459
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:49,800
candidate.
Oh,

1460
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:51,290
it's so ridiculous,
man.

1461
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:53,810
Those old blaxploitation movies were 
awesome.

1462
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:58,900
But there's something about that to 
suppress culture that just wants to win 

1463
01:03:58,900 --> 01:03:58,900
no matter what.
You know,

1464
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,770
I don't think white people will ever 
understand that.

1465
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:05,830
You'll never understand.
Never understand what that's like to be 

1466
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:07,100
an orange juice Jones.
I mean that's why.

1467
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,320
That's why white people can't wear those
links.

1468
01:04:09,321 --> 01:04:10,500
Coats,
you know,

1469
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,150
who is that kid in Miami?
There's one kid who's like a beat maker.

1470
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:19,151
He's made a bunch of beats for like 
really famous hip hop artists and he 

1471
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:23,530
made millions of dollars.
But then he wound up blowing it all on 

1472
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:24,110
cocaine is a big article about him and I
think it was esquire,

1473
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,480
esquire or Gq big article about them 
recently.

1474
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:28,430
No idea.
Some famous beat guy.

1475
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:31,370
I'm sure if you go look on Orange Juice 
Jones now did he die?

1476
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:33,920
Dorchester Bro.
Can you imagine?

1477
01:04:33,921 --> 01:04:36,250
Like if he just works at a grocery store
now and he.

1478
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:41,251
But he still goes,
I'm ordering students Jones and I 

1479
01:04:41,251 --> 01:04:41,640
recommend this orange juice like a 
years.

1480
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:45,530
Google,
Google orange juice.

1481
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,530
Where is he today?
Yeah,

1482
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:49,370
I bet he's got a website and a 
community.

1483
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,540
Hey,
check my twitter.

1484
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,140
I told Scott Storage.
Thank you very much.

1485
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:57,590
A Y,
k o seven o was another guy.

1486
01:04:57,591 --> 01:05:00,590
Got It.
Get mobile to you.

1487
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:04,490
Take your iphone and that way you with 
miss.so

1488
01:05:04,491 --> 01:05:09,491
much a fighter jet,
silly rabbit really wasn't following.

1489
01:05:10,161 --> 01:05:15,161
It wasn't even stocking.
You were allowed to what you had to 

1490
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:15,860
because he couldn't just text somebody 
and say,

1491
01:05:15,861 --> 01:05:17,830
where are you bitch?
Those days,

1492
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:22,510
man,
guys must've just had extra families all

1493
01:05:22,511 --> 01:05:23,010
over the place.

1494
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:23,830
Right?
I found him.

1495
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:25,240
Where was he?
Alex?

1496
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:28,510
After Joan's failed to have significant 
follow up success,

1497
01:05:28,511 --> 01:05:33,511
he left the music industry to tend to 
his terminally ill mother and raise a 

1498
01:05:33,511 --> 01:05:36,961
family.
He helps us son Douche or into that 

1499
01:05:36,961 --> 01:05:41,421
orange,
one orange [inaudible] better known as 

1500
01:05:41,421 --> 01:05:41,421
Mooky with his rap career in addition to
producing it,

1501
01:05:41,421 --> 01:05:43,600
score music for commercials and 
independent movies.

1502
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:47,080
Jones also contributes to a number of 
hip hop blogs,

1503
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:50,980
including Houston's just flipping.com
or global grind.

1504
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:52,940
That's it.
Wow.

1505
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:58,380
Well,
now we know about orange juice Jones 

1506
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:58,930
fucking out there in the community 
keeping shit popping.

1507
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,960
He said,
I've done standup comedy if he wrote 

1508
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:03,960
those lyrics,
you know,

1509
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,360
because that sounds like pretty,
pretty funny.

1510
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:06,900
He would have to be funny on purpose 
now.

1511
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:09,760
That wasn't funny.
Seemed kind of humorous.

1512
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:10,900
No,
I don't think so.

1513
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,240
Humorous in like.
Got You.

1514
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:13,710
Yeah.

1515
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:22,110
What?
You're laughing at his and he doesn't 

1516
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:24,091
understand what you're laughing at.
You're laughing at it because it's 

1517
01:06:24,091 --> 01:06:24,091
ridiculous.
If you laugh,

1518
01:06:24,091 --> 01:06:27,601
he would even look at you go when you 
left without out what I'm talking about 

1519
01:06:27,601 --> 01:06:27,601
woman,
fine clothes.

1520
01:06:27,601 --> 01:06:31,740
Gucci is diamonds,
37 lakes poetry.

1521
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:38,430
It is,
but you have to really mean it in order 

1522
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:38,430
for it to be poetry.
If you're just pretending like,

1523
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:43,051
you know,
is that there was that black 

1524
01:06:43,051 --> 01:06:44,460
exploitation,
a parody that came out recently with 

1525
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:44,650
Michael John White.
I didn't hear anything about it,

1526
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,790
but I,
I didn't.

1527
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:50,970
I didn't have a desire to see it because
they were trying to pretend they were 

1528
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:52,360
making a fake movie.
Like there were doing it on purpose.

1529
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:57,570
Like they were acting funny.
If you're acting ridiculous and you 

1530
01:06:58,421 --> 01:07:03,421
think it's cool,
it's not funny if you're trying to be 

1531
01:07:03,421 --> 01:07:03,421
funny,
acting ridiculous.

1532
01:07:03,421 --> 01:07:03,421
You know what I'm saying?

1533
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:04,930
It's like,
it's funny.

1534
01:07:04,931 --> 01:07:09,931
I mean it's okay,
but it's never as funny as someone who 

1535
01:07:09,931 --> 01:07:09,931
really,
you know,

1536
01:07:09,931 --> 01:07:13,170
saw you sit down baby.
Not unless it's way more funny when he's

1537
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:18,360
like r Kelly.
That's the genius of the r Kelly video 

1538
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,820
is that that guy really thinks that way.
I guarantee what I always used.

1539
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,240
Joseph went to the studio,
started saying that like,

1540
01:07:22,241 --> 01:07:25,690
people just like,
I know what I'm doing.

1541
01:07:25,691 --> 01:07:30,691
All right,
let me just lay this shit down on this 

1542
01:07:30,691 --> 01:07:30,691
bitch,
Bro.

1543
01:07:30,691 --> 01:07:33,040
They ain't going to work.
Watch my shit that he just said it.

1544
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:33,730
And he goes,
I said,

1545
01:07:33,731 --> 01:07:35,440
it's staying.
They argue for a little while.

1546
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:35,960
I wonder when

1547
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,730
people break up with orange juice,
Jones said like,

1548
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,280
what are you going to do?
Walk in the rain.

1549
01:07:39,281 --> 01:07:42,600
You're fucking retarded.
You know,

1550
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:43,870
like,
write a song about me,

1551
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:46,810
asshole.
Move on with good life.

1552
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:49,120
Keep me out of your shitty fucking cds.

1553
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,560
Ooh.

1554
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,020
Then have you ever had a girl tell you 
to not talk about her in your act?

1555
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,920
No.
Could you see the other thing is stan 

1556
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,661
hope road about a Bobby Barnett.
You know he's got that joke about this 

1557
01:08:03,661 --> 01:08:04,820
chick Bob Barnett to fuck them.
That's like way too hot to fuck him,

1558
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:10,140
but she fucked him and you know,
it's like you can't take that back at 

1559
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:10,950
thousand repo men can't take that back 
by minute.

1560
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:14,530
You fucked me and he put it in is taking
to take the edge off.

1561
01:08:14,531 --> 01:08:15,500
It was like,
it's closing bit.

1562
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:16,130
Well apparently

1563
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,480
this chick contacted him.
It's on.

1564
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:22,481
If you go to Doug Stanhope Dot com,
it's on his website with one of his 

1565
01:08:22,481 --> 01:08:22,481
blogs.
This chick contacted him,

1566
01:08:22,481 --> 01:08:22,880
you know,
just like you sick.

1567
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:27,881
Fuck,
I'm a born again Christian now and all 

1568
01:08:27,881 --> 01:08:28,280
this.
So he wrote this fucking a new basically

1569
01:08:28,281 --> 01:08:31,760
a new bit explaining you fucked me.
You can't take that back.

1570
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:35,150
He redid the bit,
like even funnier in a blog,

1571
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:36,860
you know,
talking about times and things that have

1572
01:08:36,861 --> 01:08:37,830
happened and what,
you know.

1573
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:40,310
I always wondered what you were you up 
to these days.

1574
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,500
The where are you now?
Screen.

1575
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:44,560
That plays in my mind.
Very funny man.

1576
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:47,660
Very funny shit.
You never had a check till.

1577
01:08:47,661 --> 01:08:48,800
You're not talking about her in your 
act.

1578
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:54,480
I had one ticket man,
because she 99 point nine percent 

1579
01:08:55,160 --> 01:09:00,160
positive cheated on me.
She went away and she went on vacation 

1580
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,060
and she got fucking rug burn on her 
back.

1581
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,450
She went to Florida to visit her cousin 
or cousins a whore.

1582
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,790
Okay.
She went to visit her cousin in Florida.

1583
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:12,930
She had fucking rug burn on her back and
I had my hand on her back and I felt 

1584
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:13,150
something and I pulled up her skirt,
turned around.

1585
01:09:13,151 --> 01:09:13,640
I looked at,
I go,

1586
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:15,050
I go,
what the fuck is on your back?

1587
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:17,600
And she goes,
I was drinking.

1588
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:19,760
Oh,
I was drinking and I was leaning against

1589
01:09:19,761 --> 01:09:21,620
this thing and there was like a nail on 
it.

1590
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:22,760
I go,
there's a nail.

1591
01:09:22,761 --> 01:09:24,020
I got nailed in that.
I go,

1592
01:09:24,021 --> 01:09:26,870
you didn't feel the nail.
You just kept rubbing your back back and

1593
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,010
forth on the nail.
I go,

1594
01:09:28,011 --> 01:09:30,680
that's not carpet brand.
What are you saying?

1595
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:32,120
What are you saying?
I'm saying somebody fucked,

1596
01:09:32,121 --> 01:09:33,760
you know.
No,

1597
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:34,400
I go,
okay.

1598
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:37,020
You're saying that no one fucked you.
No,

1599
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,120
it's not carpet burn.

1600
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,990
I told you I was drinking.
I didn't know what I was doing and I was

1601
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:45,590
like leaning against this thing.
I was like this crazy lion bitch.

1602
01:09:45,591 --> 01:09:48,020
It was like the dumbest lie ever.
Like this dumb whore.

1603
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:53,140
Didn't even know that she had this 
fucking scab on her back getting fucked 

1604
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:53,990
so hard.
Probably in the dirt somewhere.

1605
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:59,350
Crazy bitch.
She's probably on destruction site and 

1606
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:01,530
an asphalt parking lot of broken glass 
and 21 or 22.

1607
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,820
I think maybe I might have been a little
older.

1608
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:07,010
Um,
but it was ridiculous,

1609
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,230
but I'd already cheated on her so I 
didn't care.

1610
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,550
She was like,
it was a bad relationship.

1611
01:10:10,551 --> 01:10:11,900
I didn't enjoy it.
It wasn't a fun one,

1612
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,240
but I,
she keeps,

1613
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:17,210
she keeps a comedy show that night with 
me,

1614
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:19,580
you know,
as she got back or can you close on this

1615
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:20,690
and that.
And we went and we left.

1616
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:25,870
I don't even remember if I fucked her.
Probably not because I was probably 

1617
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:26,120
grossed out,
but it took her to my comedy show.

1618
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:27,500
She wanted to come with me and she was 
planning on it,

1619
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:32,710
so I got on stage and immediately go 
into the whole fucking story about my 

1620
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:36,791
girlfriend,
go into a spring break and coming back 

1621
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:36,890
with rug burn and I had,
you know,

1622
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:37,940
like what,
you know,

1623
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:40,790
what's worse,
and then I put that one out.

1624
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:43,580
Like how would you react to that one?
And then I tell the whole story.

1625
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,850
She was fucking furious.
She was so mad.

1626
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,680
She's like,
if you have fucking believe me,

1627
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:49,820
I go,
I believe you.

1628
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:51,320
But it's funny.
It's just a joke.

1629
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:56,500
I'm just making.
I'm just pretending that you really did 

1630
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:56,500
fuck somebody on stage.
The best thing about facebook,

1631
01:10:56,510 --> 01:11:01,080
the best thing about facebook is finding
your old babysitter and like,

1632
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:06,360
I remember this babysitter,
it was just fucking hot and she's still 

1633
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:06,360
pretty hot,
you know,

1634
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,100
now she's still the church.
You have a kitchen.

1635
01:11:07,101 --> 01:11:09,160
She never touched me,
but what she let me do it.

1636
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:11,850
Let me put my head in her crotch.
Like,

1637
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,010
like sleep in her crotch.
You know

1638
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:19,010
what I mean,
and then like I would move my head 

1639
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:19,010
around and she would like kind of like,
you know,

1640
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:22,770
squeezing my head and it was,
I just remember what's so fucking.

1641
01:11:22,771 --> 01:11:25,350
How old were you?
I'd probably say 11,

1642
01:11:25,351 --> 01:11:28,170
10 little pussy,
Pussy.

1643
01:11:28,171 --> 01:11:30,260
He was giving her a fucking forehead and
then,

1644
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:35,280
and then the shorts,
I remember she would just have the 

1645
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,900
blanket over her and like be watching TV
and I'll be like underneath the blanket,

1646
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:41,901
just do whatever I wanted to.
And then there was this one time I 

1647
01:11:41,901 --> 01:11:43,440
remember if it's the best feeling in the
world,

1648
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:48,620
I remember I climbed up,
put my hands on both sides of her tits 

1649
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,370
and just laid on top of her since she 
let you do that.

1650
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:50,970
Yeah,
that's great.

1651
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:52,590
So anyways,
I found her on facebook.

1652
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,070
Chick is crazy.
She's a fucking child molester.

1653
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:57,340
Ten years old,
making you eat a box.

1654
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,400
She's fucking high.
It doesn't matter.

1655
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,590
It's like your bit.
I fucking loved it.

1656
01:12:01,591 --> 01:12:04,140
It was the greatest thing in the whole 
entire room you think it is.

1657
01:12:04,141 --> 01:12:07,470
Do you think that she's just a total 
attention whore and she just couldn't?

1658
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:11,980
I don't think anyone was.
I think she was probably 16 or 18.

1659
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,170
She was just like,
okay,

1660
01:12:13,171 --> 01:12:14,850
this is great.
Anyways,

1661
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:17,150
I found her on facebook and she's still 
kinda hot and she's divorced.

1662
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:17,520
I said,
hey,

1663
01:12:17,521 --> 01:12:19,530
will you get drinks sometime?
Wouldn't that be cool?

1664
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:25,170
Wish you wish you live a Delaware,
the Delaware,

1665
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:33,710
Maryland shoe.
You are you planning on trying to bang 

1666
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:37,641
this out?
But I think that would be kind of high 

1667
01:12:37,641 --> 01:12:39,270
to Banger to bang them.
Know we started something 30 years ago.

1668
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,780
That would be the longest relationship 
I've ever had.

1669
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:47,170
Maybe like five years old than you.
So she'd be like 40 you think?

1670
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:48,960
Yeah,
something like that.

1671
01:12:48,961 --> 01:12:51,600
So 40.
So it's probably still lubing up itself.

1672
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,940
Still still do it once.
Get out of,

1673
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:55,680
in and out.
See what's all about.

1674
01:12:55,681 --> 01:13:00,681
If you got her pregnant,
she got her pregnant and then we both 

1675
01:13:00,681 --> 01:13:03,440
have molested a girl child.
See you just did what we were talking 

1676
01:13:05,611 --> 01:13:06,410
about earlier.
Don't.

1677
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:08,970
I'm just kidding.
That was completely.

1678
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:09,930
Yeah,
I know.

1679
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:11,610
I need a cell phone.
Wait,

1680
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:16,910
what if she fell in love with you?
What is she's always been a love with 

1681
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:18,440
when you were 11,
but now I do know.

1682
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:23,480
I know.
I know how gross is the when when 

1683
01:13:23,671 --> 01:13:28,671
someone says we were meant to be 
together and you just want to get the 

1684
01:13:28,671 --> 01:13:29,900
fuck away from them.
Like be the kids.

1685
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:31,830
See that and you're like,
oh my God,

1686
01:13:31,831 --> 01:13:33,390
do you know how much you annoy me?

1687
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:38,960
You know how much I can't wait to get 
the fuck away from you telling me we 

1688
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:39,360
were meant to be together.
Some people just want someone.

1689
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:44,560
They get so poisoned by music and songs 
and stories that they want it to work 

1690
01:13:45,691 --> 01:13:48,270
out the way it does in the movies.
They want it to be like that.

1691
01:13:48,271 --> 01:13:50,310
They wanted to be some special person in
their life.

1692
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:53,250
So even if it's not a special connection
that you have with some person,

1693
01:13:53,251 --> 01:13:58,251
they're like,
pretend it is because that's what 

1694
01:13:58,251 --> 01:14:00,111
they've always wanted.
They want to be in a fucking Sandra 

1695
01:14:00,111 --> 01:14:00,111
bullock movie.
Right?

1696
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:01,080
It's tough,
man.

1697
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:03,540
I can't stop thinking about my 
babysitter's tits.

1698
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:08,990
Oh,
that's a doctor or do any of that?

1699
01:14:08,991 --> 01:14:12,090
Creepy Shit when you were a child.
I had a 21 old chick that used to grab

1700
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,710
my deck when I was 13.
I didn't actually fuck her,

1701
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:19,711
but she would make out with me.
I would tongue kiss her and she grabbed 

1702
01:14:19,711 --> 01:14:19,711
my dick.
I was try,

1703
01:14:19,711 --> 01:14:21,700
I was going to fuck her,
but I told I couldn't get it up.

1704
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:24,460
I was like totally paranoid panicked and
I was like,

1705
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,290
I couldn't.
I didn't know exactly what was going on.

1706
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,500
Like I had never even orgasm before.
I never masturbated before.

1707
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:32,110
Nothing.
So I went from nothing to this woman.

1708
01:14:32,111 --> 01:14:37,111
She was 21,
she had tits and ass and she was 

1709
01:14:37,111 --> 01:14:39,820
Indiana,
have a boyfriend who was a construction 

1710
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:41,761
worker who was this fucking big manly 
dude with hairy chest and he would be 

1711
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:44,140
doing his fucking construction work bare
chested,

1712
01:14:44,141 --> 01:14:45,430
like in the neighborhood.
And I was like,

1713
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:48,600
this was her boyfriend and this bitch 
was right.

1714
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:53,880
Apparently anybody could fuck her.
Oh you have to do is ask and she would 

1715
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:53,880
just let the whole neighborhood just 
fucked her.

1716
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
You know?
She was just completely insane and she 

1717
01:14:59,000 --> 01:14:59,000
had me come over when I was like 13 and 
I was like,

1718
01:14:59,000 --> 01:14:59,890
there's no way this is really going to 
happen.

1719
01:14:59,891 --> 01:15:01,330
She's fucking 21.
I'm 13.

1720
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:03,680
How she even living at home with all 
these thoughts are going through my head

1721
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:08,710
right.
Next thing now she's grabbing my Dick 

1722
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:08,710
and she's sucking my tongue.
Wow.

1723
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:09,970
What the fuck?
I'm like this crazy birch.

1724
01:15:09,971 --> 01:15:11,370
Once I fucked me and I'm 13.

1725
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:13,280
Wow,
that's awesome.

1726
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:15,110
There's a lot of those chicks out there,
man.

1727
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:20,140
I used to take,
me and my friend would take all the 

1728
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,301
neighborhood girls.
There was like four of them and we'd 

1729
01:15:22,301 --> 01:15:25,120
line them up and make them all take off 
their pants and it would stick like 

1730
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,810
pencils and him and smell ironman and my
friend was just like,

1731
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:27,940
he was.
He was more.

1732
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:29,920
You put pencils in their pussies.
Yeah.

1733
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:34,921
And what do things like that like was 
like playing doctor or something like 

1734
01:15:34,921 --> 01:15:34,921
that.
You fucking great.

1735
01:15:34,921 --> 01:15:38,470
How many girls?
You must've cancels in your fuck.

1736
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:41,310
You grow.
Fuck that up.

1737
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,370
That fucking sexiest neighborhood.
You know?

1738
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:46,430
It was the sexiest neighborhood in the 
whole entire world.

1739
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:49,460
Pencils,
pencils up your snack.

1740
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:51,330
My cousin was.
She wasn't really,

1741
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:57,770
you know,
when your parents are tight with 

1742
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:57,770
somebody.
Right,

1743
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:57,770
right,
right.

1744
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:58,200
Same time.
And I found her on facebook too and then

1745
01:15:58,201 --> 01:16:00,840
when she didn't reply back to me,
I started thinking about all those times

1746
01:16:00,841 --> 01:16:03,210
I used to give her a stabbing when I was
like 11,

1747
01:16:03,211 --> 01:16:08,211
that she was like nine.
I would feel a stomach and explore with 

1748
01:16:08,211 --> 01:16:08,211
this theme.
She was pregnant.

1749
01:16:08,211 --> 01:16:09,060
I was fucking with Y'all when you were 
11.

1750
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:12,830
I would go down to Miami for the summer 
Banger Banger.

1751
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,000
You put your Dick in your ass up like a 
cat.

1752
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:17,280
You know what I'm saying?
So you didn't actually get it in there.

1753
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:18,060
Who knows

1754
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:23,220
that you started sex at 11.
Then I had another girl that had hair on

1755
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:27,000
them.

1756
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:29,740
Let's see.
She lives in the Bronx and I wouldn't go

1757
01:16:29,741 --> 01:16:34,741
up there to spend it with her and her 
family on the weekends and I give her a 

1758
01:16:34,741 --> 01:16:34,741
little fucking millennium.

1759
01:16:34,741 --> 01:16:36,410
The girl that I told you that had a 
bunch of abortions,

1760
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:41,590
that was also.
I was very young by the time I got 

1761
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:41,590
older,
she had all the abortions,

1762
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:42,500
but when I was young I dated her and 
this girl,

1763
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,660
all you have to do is touch or tense,
just touch them.

1764
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,330
And she would start freaking out and go 
with this.

1765
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:55,020
I,
I don't know what it was like and I 

1766
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:55,020
thought that like that would happen with
other girls too.

1767
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,150
And he touched a test and I'm like,
yeah,

1768
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:57,770
okay.
Touching my tests.

1769
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:58,820
Come on,
let's keep going.

1770
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:00,530
You know,
but it wasn't the same effect.

1771
01:17:00,531 --> 01:17:01,610
I'm like,
are you the broken?

1772
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:03,860
What's grabbing your ted?
Why don't you freaking out?

1773
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:07,880
Right.
It's like go into like spasms.

1774
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:08,880
Oh,

1775
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:13,010
just touching her fence.
Catholic school.

1776
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:13,720
That's that ship.

1777
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:16,040
I would get new babysitters and I 
thought they were all the same.

1778
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:18,560
So like I would get a new one and she'll
walk in and I was smack her in the ass.

1779
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,020
She's like,
what?

1780
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:21,670
What is that?
That happened to me,

1781
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:26,420
the girl who molested me when I was 21 
when she was 21 and I was 13.

1782
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:29,210
I started playing with real girls after 
that,

1783
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:31,820
like my age and when they're my age,
you know,

1784
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:33,440
I'm like crying to try to grab their 
aunts or something.

1785
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:34,640
They'd be like,
what the fuck are you doing?

1786
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:36,350
I'm like,
I thought we were going to do it.

1787
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:40,340
Boys and girls do we know they didn't 
want nothing to do with it.

1788
01:17:40,341 --> 01:17:42,830
They're like,
you can't just jump right into finger in

1789
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:43,970
me.
You've crazy asshole.

1790
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:49,490
That's the problem with any early sexual
experience.

1791
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,830
If you're having a sexual experience 
with someone who's older than you,

1792
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,050
like you're just jumping right into the 
pool.

1793
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,030
So all the,
all your contemporaries,

1794
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:57,680
you know,
like everyone's going to go through this

1795
01:17:57,681 --> 01:18:02,681
like trial and error process.
It's normally 15 year olds and 16 year 

1796
01:18:02,681 --> 01:18:06,251
olds and whatever.
They just start playing with each other 

1797
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:06,251
and then they start fighting,
but they're doing it all together.

1798
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:10,370
You just hop right into someone sucking 
your dick some crazy bitch that fucks 

1799
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:10,640
everybody on the block and you're like,
what?

1800
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:13,040
So this is what we do.
We just start fucking right and we'll go

1801
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:14,720
from nothing to hanging out with this 
whore.

1802
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:20,520
There's funny,
that first girl ever tongue kissed a I 

1803
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,581
found on facebook recently and I,
she is the biggest white piece of trash 

1804
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:28,980
ever and she's got like a hundred kids 
and she lives in Florida and we found a 

1805
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:29,830
video of her and she's like,
oh,

1806
01:18:29,831 --> 01:18:31,840
I don't know who's talking about snoop 
dog,

1807
01:18:31,841 --> 01:18:36,841
but I don't like it was and she was fat 
and it was like this dream girl that I 

1808
01:18:36,841 --> 01:18:39,760
think about all the time in my head,
like frozen in my head and now I see her

1809
01:18:39,761 --> 01:18:41,050
and I'm like,
oh my God,

1810
01:18:41,051 --> 01:18:42,100
that is so awful.

1811
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:44,990
It's funny when you look back on the,
the,

1812
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:50,050
you know,
the different types of people that you 

1813
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:50,050
kind of experiment with when you first 
start dating,

1814
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:51,690
when you're young and you don't even 
know what the fuck you like and all of a

1815
01:18:51,691 --> 01:18:54,780
sudden you catch yourself out with some 
chick who's just completely nuts.

1816
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:57,900
Think about how many fucking nasty 
bitches you dated in your life.

1817
01:18:57,901 --> 01:18:58,530
Joey Diaz.

1818
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,570
One that showed up at rasp was done on 
the show.

1819
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:06,230
Oh,
in between shows and she weighed 400 

1820
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:06,230
pounds.
It looks like she had the add.

1821
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:08,010
Thanks.
She called rascals the night before.

1822
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:13,780
Joey.
You don't remember me from the sixth 

1823
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:13,780
grade?
Yeah.

1824
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:13,780
Marjorie.
Oh fuck.

1825
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:13,780
Yeah.
Come on down.

1826
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:16,230
That showed up.
That bitch was for 80.

1827
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:21,740
Tipping the scales.
A nickel and you should've seen me 

1828
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:21,740
backpedal.
It isn't.

1829
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:24,780
I'm going to suck your fucking come 
down.

1830
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:26,710
I can't wait to fuck you.
All this shit.

1831
01:19:26,711 --> 01:19:28,560
And she didn't tell you to fuck 10 years
ago,

1832
01:19:28,561 --> 01:19:32,040
but she threw her when she.
Here's the Franklin at the black dog guy

1833
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:33,960
came to get me.
He's like dog,

1834
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:39,350
there's a fun bitch wait for the door.
But to a black dude for 80 blonde with a

1835
01:19:41,251 --> 01:19:42,820
fucking cadillac.
He went bananas,

1836
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:46,240
bananas and I went out and I was like,
rascals down.

1837
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:51,241
Let's show off route 34 down the block 
from that crazy strip club where they 

1838
01:19:51,241 --> 01:19:51,370
have no air conditioning.
No.

1839
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:53,040
What's the name of that place?
I forget this,

1840
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:57,620
that all that shit was on the shore was 
the rascals down the show is to shut.

1841
01:19:57,630 --> 01:20:00,810
Those were totally different animals 
than the rascals in west orange.

1842
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:02,330
Yes,
totally different humans.

1843
01:20:02,331 --> 01:20:02,660
Yes.

1844
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:03,770
Rascals,
West Orange,

1845
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:08,790
like a lot of cool people,
normal people that worked in the city 

1846
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:08,940
and commuted,
lived in Jersey and you know,

1847
01:20:08,941 --> 01:20:11,210
it was a nice neighborhood,
rascals down the shore.

1848
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:14,670
We're fucking savages.
They were barbarians.

1849
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:16,410
They're a totally different crowd.
Right?

1850
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:21,030
The sure savages they are.
It's funny.

1851
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:26,060
We knew about that a long time ago,
but now the whole world knows about 

1852
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:26,060
that.
Those you ever do those?

1853
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:27,590
Bob Gunzel gigs?
Dental Jersey shore.

1854
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:33,750
He just contacted me on facebook saying,
Oh yeah,

1855
01:20:33,751 --> 01:20:36,290
he's buckled a few rooms.
I was thinking about going to Jersey and

1856
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,730
uh,
he does,

1857
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,390
uh,
Asbury park or something,

1858
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:41,370
but like six rooms.
Those rooms.

1859
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:42,720
Yeah,
the summer.

1860
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,820
I did a bunch of his gigs.
Fuck yeah,

1861
01:20:44,821 --> 01:20:46,740
I did all.
I did the TV show for him.

1862
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:51,800
I did one where he had,
there's a guy named uncle something or 

1863
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:51,850
another uncle floyd.
No uncle political,

1864
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:53,240
Lloyd's comedy,
something.

1865
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:55,800
Uncle Floyd was at this guy and like 
puppets and shit.

1866
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:58,470
And he apparently had a TV show that was
like really popular in Jersey.

1867
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:03,770
I did that show and uncle floyd would do
standup and I didn't know who the fuck 

1868
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:07,491
he wants and this uncle floyd goes up 
and fucking levels the place and I can't

1869
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:09,810
believe this.
I can't believe what I'm watching it.

1870
01:21:09,811 --> 01:21:11,790
But to them it's like nostalgia,
you know,

1871
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:13,530
like they're loving it,
they're going crazy and I'm like,

1872
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,360
wow,
I had no idea this guy was popular.

1873
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:18,300
So I had a fall uncle floyd and I was 
eating Dick,

1874
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:21,450
eating Dick onstage falling uncle floyd.
Nobody wanted to hear me,

1875
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:26,900
you know,
like they had just heard this guy and 

1876
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:26,900
was like really famous,
you know,

1877
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:27,270
and I had no idea.
Where did you shoot this at?

1878
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:29,370
It wasn't a shot.
This wasn't a TV show,

1879
01:21:29,371 --> 01:21:31,590
this was just doing standup in Jersey.

1880
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:36,970
It wasn't cheap,
but it was right on 68th and was right 

1881
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:36,970
over the bridge.
I don't even remember that.

1882
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:41,961
It was a place that was on the beach.
It was a place that was actually on the 

1883
01:21:41,961 --> 01:21:46,431
beach.
It was like an outdoor little venue and 

1884
01:21:46,431 --> 01:21:46,980
it probably sat like maybe a few hundred
people,

1885
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,390
maybe two,
300.

1886
01:21:48,391 --> 01:21:51,240
I don't remember,
my memory's real shaky from this time,

1887
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,580
but I remember this guy went up and I 
had never heard of them,

1888
01:21:53,581 --> 01:21:55,470
but they went nuts when he went onstage 
almost like,

1889
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,740
wow.
And then they told me,

1890
01:21:56,750 --> 01:22:01,750
oh,
there's a local New Jersey television 

1891
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:01,750
shows,
like really popular,

1892
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:02,430
like Whoa.
But it was like really clean too.

1893
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:07,760
So after that,
that's the worst thing you want is 

1894
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:07,760
someone killing when they're clean and 
then you go on.

1895
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,840
I have to run 30.
Especially if nobody knows you,

1896
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:11,820
you just feel like such a sack of shit.

1897
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:16,480
There's a really great topic that I 
started on your forms that just has been

1898
01:22:16,481 --> 01:22:18,580
becoming popular again in the last two 
days.

1899
01:22:18,581 --> 01:22:22,720
And I don't know if you've ever read it.
It's called the story of Haley Riley and

1900
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:24,970
uh,
I just retweeted it on my twitter at red

1901
01:22:24,971 --> 01:22:29,971
band,
but it's about this girl that I used to 

1902
01:22:29,971 --> 01:22:32,581
be really good friends with that I met,
met on the Internet and every time I 

1903
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:32,581
was,
uh,

1904
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:34,150
I would talk to her on the phone.
She would send me pictures.

1905
01:22:34,151 --> 01:22:39,151
She was fucking gorgeous.
And one time in Arizona we were talking 

1906
01:22:39,151 --> 01:22:39,151
and she wanted to meet me,
but,

1907
01:22:39,151 --> 01:22:39,560
uh,
she,

1908
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:42,580
she acted really weird and wouldn't come
see me and stuff like that.

1909
01:22:42,581 --> 01:22:44,380
And she said she has a secret or 
something like that,

1910
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:45,940
whatever.
It was kind of fucking weird.

1911
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,210
So I stopped kinda talking to her after 
that because it was kind of creepy.

1912
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:50,590
Anyways,
uh,

1913
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:51,340
I,
uh,

1914
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,580
lately I got an email from a guy and he 
goes,

1915
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:59,970
you know,
he's asking me if I knew that knew her 

1916
01:22:59,970 --> 01:22:59,970
and what I thought about her and stuff 
like that.

1917
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:04,411
And there's this long email and there's 
this whole backstory of this thing on 

1918
01:23:04,411 --> 01:23:04,480
your forms on,
so check it out.

1919
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,010
But it turns

1920
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,490
out this girl was just like a huge crazy
fat girl,

1921
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:13,390
you know,
and she just made up a fake personnel if

1922
01:23:13,391 --> 01:23:15,700
faith name.
She stole somebody's identity,

1923
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:19,240
like took all their photos from like a 
myspace or facebook.

1924
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:22,090
And she's been doing this for about 10 
years.

1925
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,360
And uh,
this guy flew down,

1926
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:30,390
got a hotel,
fucking spent all this money than met 

1927
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:33,751
the girl.
And she was completely different from 

1928
01:23:33,751 --> 01:23:33,751
what she is.
And,

1929
01:23:33,751 --> 01:23:37,320
and now there's photos of what the real 
person looks wise guide took this photo 

1930
01:23:37,391 --> 01:23:40,110
and took like the whole story and made 
like an article about it.

1931
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:40,590
No,
he,

1932
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:43,660
me and him just emailed back and forth.
He started sharing photos.

1933
01:23:43,661 --> 01:23:45,610
We start talking.
I have the whole thing of like know that

1934
01:23:45,611 --> 01:23:49,860
you knew about it because uh,
I think back in the day I,

1935
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:54,960
uh,
somewhere like in live journal or 

1936
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:54,960
something like that.

1937
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,990
Uh,
I had my old website on their connected 

1938
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:58,780
to our somehow and he was just asking if
I ever knew her,

1939
01:23:58,781 --> 01:24:03,781
if I still talked to her and he was just
trying to know that he wasn't some fat 

1940
01:24:03,781 --> 01:24:05,530
guy pretending to be some guy because 
she's totally.

1941
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:10,870
She sent me,
like he starts sending me photos and we 

1942
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:11,380
figured it out and everything out.
And I tried to confront Haley and,

1943
01:24:11,381 --> 01:24:12,730
and you know,
she wouldn't respond.

1944
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,390
Anyways,
that was two years ago and now there's a

1945
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:19,780
new victim read on the message board is 
called what it's called,

1946
01:24:19,781 --> 01:24:24,781
the story of Haley Riley.
And it's on the front page of the messy 

1947
01:24:24,781 --> 01:24:28,320
l e y h a I l e y last name is r e I l e
y and it's all my people go to forum dot

1948
01:24:32,261 --> 01:24:35,530
Joe Rogan Dot net.
It's in the shit talking one on one.

1949
01:24:35,550 --> 01:24:37,890
Yeah.
I posted on my twitter to read band.

1950
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,190
Wow.
Interesting.

1951
01:24:39,191 --> 01:24:42,180
Can you imagine being that person?
That's gotta be a weird fantasy world.

1952
01:24:42,181 --> 01:24:45,030
Some new guidance is emailing me like it
just happened again.

1953
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:50,040
Then playing the sims.
How's that different than playing world 

1954
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,010
of warcraft?
What's the playing world of warcraft?

1955
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:52,030
Yeah.
What's the point?

1956
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,400
She's talking.
You're not a fucking wizard.

1957
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:55,870
Okay.
She's not a hot chick,

1958
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:58,360
but she's pretending and she's having a 
good God damn time.

1959
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:03,570
She's running around just scamming dudes
and getting them to fly in and visit 

1960
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:03,570
her.
And she's.

1961
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:07,020
She's probably crazy.
So weird though because your forum 

1962
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:07,020
members,
four members have been saying,

1963
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:08,320
oh,
I got the same thing happened to me.

1964
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:13,350
Oh.
And there's like three different side 

1965
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:13,350
stories now.
The completely of the same topic.

1966
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:14,160
That's kind of cool.
Yeah,

1967
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:16,300
I think it's kind of interesting.
You know?

1968
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:17,790
Crazy.
I mean,

1969
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:20,080
she's not hurting anybody,
it's not asking for money except for the

1970
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:23,250
guy that's flying out and spending money
on fucking promise.

1971
01:25:24,230 --> 01:25:26,350
If you play that fucking game,
you should get busted.

1972
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:30,860
Did I ever tell you this is a crazy 
story that tries to fly her out?

1973
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,970
Supposed to fly her out?
He played fucking stupid.

1974
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:36,790
I totally made a bad move.
Rook takes bond.

1975
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:39,660
I totally forgot about a story that I've
never told you and I.

1976
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:41,410
It's the only time I've ever fucked a 
fat chick.

1977
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:44,720
The same thing happened at one time,
like a really fucked one.

1978
01:25:44,730 --> 01:25:45,880
Fat,
like a real one,

1979
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:46,920
you know?
Not like a,

1980
01:25:46,921 --> 01:25:48,580
like a little chunky.
I'm familiar.

1981
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:56,710
It was making me fucking nervous when 
they're around me to hug him.

1982
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,830
It was an aol first came out,
they used have profiles,

1983
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:03,970
kind

1984
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,980
of like facebook Spec in the days and he
would chat to people and stuff like 

1985
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:11,891
that.
This girl had a fake all these fake 

1986
01:26:11,891 --> 01:26:11,891
photos of.
Actually it wasn't fake.

1987
01:26:11,891 --> 01:26:12,320
It was when she lost a lot of weight or 
something like that,

1988
01:26:12,321 --> 01:26:17,321
and then she gained the back maybe 100 
pounds or something and she wanted to 

1989
01:26:17,321 --> 01:26:17,321
get laid.
She lived near me.

1990
01:26:17,321 --> 01:26:18,960
We used to private chat all the time.
Uh,

1991
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:24,110
so I was like,
one day I got really horny and I was 

1992
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:24,110
like,
fuck,

1993
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:24,110
you know what,
let's meet and I'll pick you up,

1994
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:24,470
come back to my place drinking and 
fucking.

1995
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:25,130
She's like,
Oh yeah,

1996
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:26,120
let's do it.
So anyways,

1997
01:26:26,121 --> 01:26:28,460
I come to her sorority,
her sorority house,

1998
01:26:28,461 --> 01:26:29,570
I come there and I'm like,
uh,

1999
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:31,980
I see this big group of girls and I see 
this,

2000
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,530
this hot girl.
And I'm like,

2001
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,370
oh,
there she is.

2002
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:39,510
And then that whole,
that whole girl got blocked like an 

2003
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:39,510
eclipse of this fat girl that came into 
my vision,

2004
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:44,500
like,
and like stepped in front of the girl 

2005
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:44,500
and it was her and she was like a blonde
chick,

2006
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:48,650
probably about one 80 maybe or 200 
maybe.

2007
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:52,340
I mean she was big and tall,
like five,

2008
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:53,310
four,
five.

2009
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:59,110
It was big,
but her face was cute type thing and I 

2010
01:26:59,110 --> 01:26:59,110
was so like,
I remember driving back to my place.

2011
01:26:59,110 --> 01:26:59,480
I'm like,
this is bullshit.

2012
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:01,160
What do I do?
Do I just stopped the car?

2013
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:03,440
Why do even let her in the car?
So anyways,

2014
01:27:03,441 --> 01:27:07,130
I got drunk and I fucked her and then I 
took her right home and I,

2015
01:27:07,131 --> 01:27:07,160
I

2016
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,830
deleted her.
I've never talked again.

2017
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:11,800
And.
But you know what if some of the best,

2018
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:17,100
some of the best pussy over there,
fucking juicy chicken weight watches.

2019
01:27:17,361 --> 01:27:20,920
Now that's she's about one 90.
Yeah,

2020
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:23,290
bitches banging and I feel like talk to 
her.

2021
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:28,570
I feel like going up to him going,
what the fuck you want to lose weight 

2022
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:28,570
for a look at that.
As you know,

2023
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:32,920
we'll look at that fucking monster.
But monster that she said that counting 

2024
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:33,140
points,
it's a waste of fucking time.

2025
01:27:33,141 --> 01:27:36,530
This chick's pretty hot.
Some dudes love a thick girl.

2026
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,480
Some,
some dudes just love it.

2027
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:42,080
They do not like fit girl.
Fucking Russian.

2028
01:27:42,081 --> 01:27:47,081
We'd store on sunset across from rock 
and roll routes and you look at that 

2029
01:27:47,081 --> 01:27:48,330
behemoth of a chicken.
You come out and talk to,

2030
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:53,060
you wouldn't fuck this chick to death.
She's hotter than hot and this bitch,

2031
01:27:53,061 --> 01:27:58,061
everybody who goes in there walks out of
there mummified because you can't 

2032
01:27:58,061 --> 01:27:58,700
believe you want to fuck a little 
milkshake and how fat.

2033
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:01,250
Fifty pounds overweight.
Yup.

2034
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:05,630
Big Fat washing.
Her name is Natasha.

2035
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:11,170
She's dirty about.
And this chick just throws heat from the

2036
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:13,500
fucking.
What is it about Russian brides?

2037
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,520
There's like a hardness that's like 
extra dirty,

2038
01:28:16,521 --> 01:28:21,521
but you don't want to go to sleep with a
fucking scar where your kidneys was 

2039
01:28:21,521 --> 01:28:23,520
something need to be taught a lesson.
You know,

2040
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:28,930
I've waited online.
I've seen how the guys looking at guys 

2041
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:29,090
with chicks guys and a handsome guys.
Check her out.

2042
01:28:29,091 --> 01:28:30,140
Like,
you know,

2043
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:31,370
man,
I would fuck.

2044
01:28:31,371 --> 01:28:34,370
Just tell she's dirty.
But you could tell she's hot.

2045
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:35,870
She's young.
Twenty two,

2046
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:39,220
page 22 and big catcher now.
Yeah.

2047
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:44,270
Actually now before it all goes.
So she looks like one of those girls 

2048
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:44,270
that just big boned.
But she'll take you for the ride.

2049
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:49,050
The fucking light that asks is good when
you eat that ass from behind this Steve 

2050
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,150
Pounds overweight and you're eating her 
ass.

2051
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:53,900
50.
Say Bro.

2052
01:28:53,901 --> 01:28:58,901
Sometimes I'd asked is good.
They're eating cake cake val and dairy 

2053
01:28:58,911 --> 01:29:00,020
queen.
That acid is good.

2054
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:02,610
Yummier for me.
I've never been a,

2055
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:07,850
you know what?
I never fucked a chick fat when I was 

2056
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:10,011
drunk or nothing like that.
But I think I had like a girlfriend 

2057
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:12,711
once.
I was little on the heavy side of 

2058
01:29:12,711 --> 01:29:12,711
stabbing.
When you're doing unschooling?

2059
01:29:12,711 --> 01:29:12,711
No,
no headphones.

2060
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:14,330
The um,
the,

2061
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,310
the famous girl ever fuck was probably 
about one slash 70,

2062
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,550
but them,
you bring in some ways.

2063
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:27,360
I was probably about one 70 at the time.
So I looked at a special place for about

2064
01:29:27,361 --> 01:29:32,361
what?
I weigh [inaudible] she's shorter than 

2065
01:29:32,361 --> 01:29:32,361
me,
but thick.

2066
01:29:32,361 --> 01:29:32,361
It's so unfortunate.
You know,

2067
01:29:32,361 --> 01:29:37,341
it's a very sad thing when you see a 
girl who like could be so hot and she 

2068
01:29:37,341 --> 01:29:39,490
just got some weird food thing going on,
you know,

2069
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:43,200
DNA to be thick and this girl would go 
back and forth.

2070
01:29:43,790 --> 01:29:45,210
Fake chicken,
a fat check.

2071
01:29:45,211 --> 01:29:50,211
There's a big difference.
But this girl would like to see if she 

2072
01:29:50,211 --> 01:29:51,780
would have these weird eating things.
Go on this weird eating beyonce.

2073
01:29:51,781 --> 01:29:54,240
She's thick.
You can tell a white burger.

2074
01:29:54,241 --> 01:29:57,000
You asked what the fuck the world up to 
get her a little bit.

2075
01:29:57,001 --> 01:29:57,820
Yeah.
She goes,

2076
01:29:58,010 --> 01:29:59,490
but right now she's perfect.
She's.

2077
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:04,580
She's just.
She's got that one foot up in the air 

2078
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:05,180
and she's balancing.
But as long as she's balancing God.

2079
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:06,480
Damn.
Yeah.

2080
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:07,920
That's,
that's the perfect shape.

2081
01:30:07,921 --> 01:30:09,510
Like beyonce body.
She's not.

2082
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:11,490
So dudes like,
who know who likes.

2083
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:16,700
I don't get that whole skinny obsession.
The girls in Hollywood with this fucking

2084
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:19,350
the stick figure body.
What is that?

2085
01:30:19,351 --> 01:30:20,940
Is that girls doing it for girls?

2086
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:21,600
What does,
what does,

2087
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:24,270
what does that really passionate sheep?
Is that what it is?

2088
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:27,060
It's totally the fashion industry is the
magazine industry.

2089
01:30:27,061 --> 01:30:27,570
It's all that.

2090
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:29,160
Did they look better in those kinds of 
clothes?

2091
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:30,720
But they don't realize.
They don't.

2092
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:34,390
They don't look better to us.
Frank's can't haunted this motherfucker.

2093
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:38,790
Air Conditioning unit was crashed.
This skinny,

2094
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:40,590
skinny,
skinny girl and get stabbed.

2095
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:43,090
Was that pussy good at?
Were you at university?

2096
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:49,980
A little pussy.
So they always get that big bone in 

2097
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:51,550
front of the the doodle doodle.
They're so skinny.

2098
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:54,520
Sometimes you're reading the noon one,
get bang like a fucking.

2099
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:58,930
It takes somebody hits you in the 
fucking fucking bone is right there.

2100
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,230
I want a woman with some fucking heat 
down dog.

2101
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:02,680
Tell me the truth.
Seriously,

2102
01:31:02,681 --> 01:31:03,200
you should have

2103
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:07,370
start a website showing your balls 
dropping as you're losing weight.

2104
01:31:07,610 --> 01:31:10,380
So I'm what your balls are people.
I want to see that they do want to this.

2105
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:15,440
I was just discussing this with you 
because you're a certain interest in 

2106
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:15,440
mind

2107
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:16,540
balls.
No investment on my balls.

2108
01:31:16,570 --> 01:31:21,570
I'm on the new homeless diet and weight.
Trying to lose 35 pounds and I'm not 

2109
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:23,020
shaving to ideal because I fucking hate 
facial hair so much.

2110
01:31:23,021 --> 01:31:28,021
So it's making me want to fucking do it 
quick and I've never met anybody like 

2111
01:31:28,021 --> 01:31:31,861
you who goes so far down.
You lose all the weight and then you 

2112
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:33,250
gain it right back as soon as you start 
dating the chick.

2113
01:31:33,910 --> 01:31:38,910
Because I would go out to eat so much.
I haven't dated someone that likes to 

2114
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:38,910
cook.
You know?

2115
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:38,910
It seems like a date,
all these out.

2116
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:39,220
What it is.
Yeah.

2117
01:31:39,350 --> 01:31:43,630
It's just so it's a food thing.
I eat out every night.

2118
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,900
You get just get crazy and just gorge.
No,

2119
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:46,590
I just,
you know,

2120
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,100
it's just,
it's just normal.

2121
01:31:48,101 --> 01:31:49,120
I just,
I don't know,

2122
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:50,140
but yeah.
Yeah.

2123
01:31:50,141 --> 01:31:55,141
I mean,
but I've lost 14 pounds in a week and a 

2124
01:31:55,141 --> 01:31:55,520
half being skinny.
Skinny.

2125
01:31:55,521 --> 01:32:00,521
You left metabolisms jacked man.
Why don't you just start working out 

2126
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:00,521
hard?

2127
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:02,530
Just just one hour.
One hour.

2128
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,950
Like weightlifting.
When you weight lift man,

2129
01:32:04,951 --> 01:32:07,920
you burn off so many calories.
Just you don't have to like lift heavy.

2130
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:12,160
Just get like 25 pound dumbbells and do 
cleans and kettlebells.

2131
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:13,420
Great.
I'm going to get a Kettlebell.

2132
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:15,310
Twenty five pound kettle bells.
All you need.

2133
01:32:15,311 --> 01:32:20,311
Do I do this one crazy cardio workout?
It's a DVD that I do with just 1:35

2134
01:32:20,771 --> 01:32:22,030
pound kettle bells.
It seems like.

2135
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:23,530
How?
How's that even going to get you tired,

2136
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:24,940
dude?
It gets.

2137
01:32:24,941 --> 01:32:28,300
Your heart is flying and so your heart's
like 100 8,690

2138
01:32:28,301 --> 01:32:31,780
beats a minute and it takes forever to 
recover.

2139
01:32:31,781 --> 01:32:32,980
It's fucking hard,
man.

2140
01:32:32,981 --> 01:32:34,270
It's a brutal,
brutal workout.

2141
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,310
One little cowbell just moving your 
whole body,

2142
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,380
making your whole body when you do 
something like that.

2143
01:32:38,381 --> 01:32:39,910
Dude,
you can eat whatever the fuck you want.

2144
01:32:40,010 --> 01:32:45,010
You know,
it's crazy as that resveratrol or 

2145
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:45,010
whatever I've been taking for the last 
three weeks.

2146
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:46,410
That shit has destroyed my,
uh,

2147
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:51,500
appetite.
Like I get full so fast now in or I 

2148
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:54,530
don't even feel hungry.
Will you show that seems like a bunch of

2149
01:32:54,531 --> 01:32:56,660
different changes in your personal?
Absolutely.

2150
01:32:57,080 --> 01:33:02,080
Absolutely.
But that was one of the things my dad 

2151
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,080
told me that it did for him.
So I'm like,

2152
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,080
oh,
really?

2153
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,270
Yeah.
But now it's like,

2154
01:33:02,271 --> 01:33:03,980
I really have a hard time trying to eat 
right now.

2155
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:06,290
It's ridiculous.
It's like I'd be halfway through a salad

2156
01:33:06,291 --> 01:33:07,190
and I'll be like,
oh,

2157
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:12,640
we're going,
we're going with Joey Italian Deli 

2158
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:15,560
place.
Placed the sausage and pepper subs.

2159
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:17,390
Oh,
put some makeup.

2160
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:19,490
Brave dog.
It makes dieting easier.

2161
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:23,690
You're hanging onto bill burrs comb like
it's your best touching that.

2162
01:33:23,691 --> 01:33:26,420
There's things in it is

2163
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:28,650
old school.
He carries a Komen,

2164
01:33:28,651 --> 01:33:30,030
has pocket show to the camera.
Joey.

2165
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,940
Bill Burr.
Show that towards the camera.

2166
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:33,940
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2167
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:34,630
Oh,
you got it.

2168
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:36,150
Bill Burr.
So old school.

2169
01:33:36,151 --> 01:33:39,420
He carries a comb in his pocket.
And when he was here he left it.

2170
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:43,020
So we're just going to leave it here out
of respect until bill burr returns.

2171
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:45,150
We're just gonna leave it on his spot.
That's a seat.

2172
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:45,720
I won't let him.

2173
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:50,740
Hey Joey,
smell it and tell me what it smells 

2174
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:50,740
like.
She was like red head.

2175
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:54,130
So it was like red little nubbies shit.
Did you guys hear about that?

2176
01:33:55,461 --> 01:33:56,960
Foxcom Shit.
That company.

2177
01:33:56,961 --> 01:34:01,961
That's a.
We talked about it several times in the 

2178
01:34:01,961 --> 01:34:01,961
past.
This is the,

2179
01:34:01,961 --> 01:34:03,430
but he did.
They make iphone and their employees are

2180
01:34:03,431 --> 01:34:04,390
killing themselves and shit,

2181
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:07,460
right?
Well they put up a suicide nets now.

2182
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:08,830
So,
uh,

2183
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:14,020
thank God that if.
Can you imagine just being somebody 

2184
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:14,020
that's like,
Hey,

2185
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:14,150
I might get a job at Foxconn,

2186
01:34:14,151 --> 01:34:19,151
and then you're like,

2189
01:34:19,151 --> 01:34:19,430

2190
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:21,320
Why would you be like,
oh fuck,

2191
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:24,050
I don't think I want to work here.
This shit.

2192
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:28,370
He didn't commit suicide,
but you got a free pass free shot.

2193
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,020
Imagine you jump.
You're like,

01:34:30,021 --> 01:34:31,420

I should've done this.
A net.

2196
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,390
Yeah,
I think it might be fun.

2197
01:34:35,391 --> 01:34:37,610
That might be what if everyone just 
starts trying to dive in,

2198
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:38,520
dive in.
Fun.

2199
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,010
If you're working in a place that sucks,

2200
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:42,020
is that bad that so many people are 
killing themselves.

2201
01:34:42,021 --> 01:34:47,021
They have to have nets up.
Chances are jumping in those nets be 

2202
01:34:47,021 --> 01:34:47,021
funny as shit.

2203
01:34:47,021 --> 01:34:47,021
Yeah,
but anyways,

2204
01:34:47,021 --> 01:34:49,680
they're about to open another company or
another location.

2205
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:50,440
Really?
Yeah,

2206
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:51,510
for $300,000.

2207
01:34:51,630 --> 01:34:52,200
Well,
you know,

2208
01:34:52,201 --> 01:34:57,201
we've talked about this before.
You can't get a fucking iphone for 200 

2209
01:34:57,201 --> 01:34:57,201
bucks if you're paying the people to 
work for you.

2210
01:34:57,201 --> 01:34:58,730
Yeah.
You just got to get slave labor.

2211
01:34:58,731 --> 01:35:02,480
You got to get people to work for 
fucking bowls of rice or $16,

2212
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:07,070
16 hour days and isn't the iphone and 
most electronics made by precious metals

2213
01:35:07,071 --> 01:35:07,820
or like,
you know,

2214
01:35:07,830 --> 01:35:11,930
like where people were shot daily for 
these,

2215
01:35:11,950 --> 01:35:16,950
you know,
all this shit is going on in 

2216
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:18,341
Afghanistan.
A lot of what they're going to get out 

2217
01:35:18,341 --> 01:35:18,341
of the ground there is shit to make an 
iphone.

2218
01:35:18,341 --> 01:35:18,341
Right?
Exactly.

2219
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:20,330
It is.
It's fucking incredible.

2220
01:35:20,331 --> 01:35:22,350
Fine.
A trillion dollars with a mineral.

2221
01:35:22,351 --> 01:35:24,470
So like we just found it.
We didn't even know it was there.

2222
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:27,860
Meanwhile they said the Soviet Union 
discovered this shit 30 years ago.

2223
01:35:28,150 --> 01:35:30,550
I just couldn't figure out how to get it
out and couldn't figure it out.

2224
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:33,340
How to fucking control the region.
What,

2225
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,270
what the fuck are we do?
Joe Diaz?

2226
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:37,430
Give us your wisdom.
What the fuck are we doing?

2227
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:40,260
Having wars in 2010,
why do people still tolerate it?

2228
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:43,190
Because the heroines kicking over there 
in Afghanistan.

2229
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:44,840
It's got to have something to do with 
the heroin.

2230
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:47,870
To do what you got to fucking do.
It hasn't stopped.

2231
01:35:48,570 --> 01:35:50,320
It hasn't stopped.
Got a stapled.

2232
01:35:50,321 --> 01:35:55,321
Think that it's ridiculous thing that 
heroin has something to do with this 

2233
01:35:55,321 --> 01:35:55,321
war,
but all you need to know,

2234
01:35:55,321 --> 01:36:00,221
and these are real facts,
is that over 90 percent of the world's 

2235
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:04,460
heroine is grown in Afghanistan.
Over 90 percent was the other temple.

2236
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:08,480
Where the fuck is that money going?
Is it going to war lords?

2237
01:36:08,481 --> 01:36:10,430
Because if it is,
where's their private jets?

2238
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:11,770
Okay,
where's the war,

2239
01:36:11,771 --> 01:36:16,771
Lord?
How come the warlord isn't living like 

2240
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:16,771
the fucking Sultan of Brunei?

2241
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:16,771
You know why we're.
Where are they?

2242
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:17,960
How come they don't have that money?
Maybe they don't.

2243
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:19,040
They don't.
They don't.

2244
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:24,070
It's not like Mexico.
It's not just that heroin that shit's 

2245
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:25,700
coming straight to America son.
That shit's been flown in.

2246
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:27,860
Barry Seals and the fucking new world 
order.

2247
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:30,910
They're all flying that shit in and 
propeller Perry's seal.

2248
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:32,270
Look,
barry seal up.

2249
01:36:32,271 --> 01:36:37,271
Educate.
These motherfucking CEO was a guy who 

2250
01:36:37,271 --> 01:36:39,610
got killed.
He was bringing in drugs from South 

2251
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:42,280
America.
Guy Got murdered while he was going to 

2252
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:42,280
testify and he had bushes.
Phone number in his pocket.

2253
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:46,890
Very barry seal was the definitive case.
He was connected to every single,

2254
01:36:46,891 --> 01:36:50,300
like big time drug dealer,
Pablo Escobar,

2255
01:36:50,301 --> 01:36:52,580
all those guys,
everybody in South America,

2256
01:36:52,581 --> 01:36:55,700
this guy is connected to and he got 
busted in Mena,

2257
01:36:55,701 --> 01:36:58,100
Arkansas.
They dropped a package off.

2258
01:36:58,260 --> 01:36:59,720
What they used to do is they would fly 
in,

2259
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:04,870
he would fly in from South America and a
little propeller plane flying to 

2260
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:07,421
Arkansas,
dropped a package off in Paris by 

2261
01:37:07,421 --> 01:37:08,780
parachute,
get out of the plane,

2262
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:11,630
and then the guys would go at the drop 
spot and pick up the parachute.

2263
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:14,210
They show up in a pickup truck or 
whatever they use.

2264
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:19,630
Well,
some kids were fucking around in the 

2265
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:21,101
woods and these kids spotted the 
parachute drop and when they went to go 

2266
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:22,160
pick up the package,
they saw these kids.

2267
01:37:22,161 --> 01:37:27,161
They're so.
They killed the kids and they took the 

2268
01:37:27,161 --> 01:37:28,070
kids bodies and they laid them on the 
tracks and yeah.

2269
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:33,130
And the autopsy came back so that the 
kids were high and they fell asleep on 

2270
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:33,130
the tracks.
So the parents said,

2271
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:33,810
that's ridiculous.
My,

2272
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,480
my,
my children didn't do drugs.

2273
01:37:35,481 --> 01:37:40,481
I don't believe you.
So the parents paid for their own 

2274
01:37:40,481 --> 01:37:41,570
autopsies and their own autopsy was 
concluded that the kids were murdered,

2275
01:37:41,571 --> 01:37:44,120
that they were stabbed,
they found stab wounds on the body,

2276
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:49,420
so the parents like started trying to 
figure out what the fuck went wrong and 

2277
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:53,231
they started figuring out who landed 
planes and what happened and blah blah 

2278
01:37:53,231 --> 01:37:53,231
blah blah.

2279
01:37:53,231 --> 01:37:56,250
And then they busted Scott Barry Seals 
and bearings seals a fucking employee of

2280
01:37:56,251 --> 01:38:00,420
the CIA who had been flying drugs into 
this country for decades.

2281
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,430
And he said that that's just what they 
do.

2282
01:38:02,431 --> 01:38:07,431
That's what they've always done.
There's money out there to be made and 

2283
01:38:07,431 --> 01:38:09,861
they know it and they make it and you 
talking about the same people that are 

2284
01:38:09,861 --> 01:38:10,650
willing to start wars.
They're willing to do that whole Gulf of

2285
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:15,651
Tonkin thing.
We went to the Vietnam War war under 

2286
01:38:15,651 --> 01:38:17,931
false pretenses and false flag attack 
just in order to make sure that we're 

2287
01:38:17,931 --> 01:38:20,340
involved in disputes with other 
countries and one of the things they do.

2288
01:38:20,341 --> 01:38:25,341
We're involved with disputes over other 
countries as they jacked or natural 

2289
01:38:25,341 --> 01:38:26,340
resources and one of their natural 
resources or drugs.

2290
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:31,820
And what you don't think that 
Afghanistan is a fucking gigantic money 

2291
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:33,330
hole for those evil scumbags that are 
willing to do shit like that.

2292
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:34,910
There's so much money there.
How do you,

2293
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:40,040
what the fuck do you do when there's 90 
percent of the world's anything in one 

2294
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:40,500
spot that's worth billions of dollars?
Billions.

2295
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:42,480
Billions.
But it's a ridiculous thing.

2296
01:38:42,481 --> 01:38:43,470
If you say it,
you're a nut.

2297
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:48,710
If you start saying,
part of the reason why we're in 

2298
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:48,710
Afghanistan is because someone's making 
money off drugs.

2299
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:49,560
That's the,
that's definitely got to be something to

2300
01:38:49,561 --> 01:38:51,060
do with it.
People think you're crazy.

2301
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:55,380
It's not the whole reason we're there.
But if you don't think it plays a part,

2302
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,840
you don't think it has a saying who's 
making money during the war.

2303
01:38:57,841 --> 01:39:01,170
You've got to fight that fucking war.
We think finances this shit,

2304
01:39:01,171 --> 01:39:02,460
you know?
Well,

2305
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:05,070
you know,
the whole thing that happened during the

2306
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:08,430
Reagan administration with the Contras,
you know,

2307
01:39:08,431 --> 01:39:09,720
and uh,
when the,

2308
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:14,100
that Michael Rupert Guy Busted the CIA 
selling drugs in Los Angeles,

2309
01:39:14,101 --> 01:39:15,150
ghettos,
you know,

2310
01:39:15,151 --> 01:39:20,151
all that stuff is,
that's just standard operational 

2311
01:39:20,151 --> 01:39:22,911
procedure.
It just takes a while for it to pop out 

2312
01:39:22,911 --> 01:39:22,911
and get into the new sometimes.
You know,

2313
01:39:23,230 --> 01:39:26,140
what the fuck do you see Ari Shaffir on 
tmz today?

2314
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:27,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

2315
01:39:27,070 --> 01:39:28,260
That's great.
I was there.

2316
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:29,740
That was a fun time.
But uh,

2317
01:39:29,741 --> 01:39:34,741
he uh,
him in a way that Rowdy Roddy Piper a 

2318
01:39:34,741 --> 01:39:36,720
got a Roddy Roddy Piper beat him up on 
stage.

2319
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:37,380
Well,
we're,

2320
01:39:37,381 --> 01:39:39,600
I'm thinking that he would really was a 
racist,

2321
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:41,580
which is a big problem with that 
character.

2322
01:39:41,581 --> 01:39:43,380
He does.
People don't know that it's an act,

2323
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:48,630
you know,
that he's just trying to get people's 

2324
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:50,631
reactions and just be a nut and have 
people react to this fake racist 

2325
01:39:50,631 --> 01:39:52,020
characters.
So they get angry at him,

2326
01:39:52,021 --> 01:39:53,100
but he's not really racist.

2327
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:54,020
Right.
Well,

2328
01:39:54,021 --> 01:39:59,021
he kind of is like,
everyone else kidding or he's not a 

2329
01:39:59,871 --> 01:40:04,871
racist.
That is a very open mind and objective 

2330
01:40:04,871 --> 01:40:04,880
person.
So it's kind of funny that already would

2331
01:40:04,881 --> 01:40:09,881
be playing this character,
the amazing racist because it was a 

2332
01:40:09,881 --> 01:40:12,581
joke.
It was national lampoon and it should 

2333
01:40:12,581 --> 01:40:14,811
have moved on,
but do you think he should have moved 

2334
01:40:14,811 --> 01:40:14,811
on?
I think it should have.

2335
01:40:14,811 --> 01:40:15,620
I've told him many times.
Have you told him,

2336
01:40:15,621 --> 01:40:17,600
Brian,
what do you think the character has done

2337
01:40:17,601 --> 01:40:18,250
that was a,
you know,

2338
01:40:18,251 --> 01:40:23,251
the whole idea that character is done 
and you don't want to really be known 

2339
01:40:23,251 --> 01:40:23,251
for that.
If the calculus,

2340
01:40:23,251 --> 01:40:25,280
I would've kept doing videos as the 
character with new ideas,

2341
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:29,050
but I really want you to keep going.
I think at a certain point in time,

2342
01:40:29,051 --> 01:40:31,100
it's like how many stereotypes you're 
going to experience it.

2343
01:40:31,101 --> 01:40:31,850
It's a joke.

2344
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:33,350
You know,
you already did the job.

2345
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,900
There was no reason to keep on doing the
same joke over and over again.

2346
01:40:35,901 --> 01:40:40,901
I think he didn't do a Jewish one and be
done because he had too much success 

2347
01:40:40,901 --> 01:40:42,590
with it and he just got caught up in it 
to keep it going.

2348
01:40:42,591 --> 01:40:43,740
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2349
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,770
That's one of the most successful things
that he's done.

2350
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:47,170
You know,
the National Lampoon thing,

2351
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:52,230
pretty famous.
You don't see me make still making car 

2352
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:52,230
lisman sia videos.
You,

2353
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:56,670
you know that.
That was probably my most successful 

2354
01:40:56,670 --> 01:40:56,840
video I've done,
but yeah,

2355
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:59,170
absolutely the best video I've ever 
done.

2356
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:03,400
That's actually what all the girls like 
to that stuff.

2357
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:05,630
It's Hilarious when the cat reacts to 
your Forte.

2358
01:41:06,510 --> 01:41:07,750
There's one.
You see that one where I did.

2359
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:09,370
Did Lindsay Lohan?
Yes,

2360
01:41:09,490 --> 01:41:11,470
I saw that too.
That was pretty ridiculous.

2361
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:17,170
So now what happened when Lindsay Lohan,
because I drink that Kombucha shit and 

2362
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:19,630
everybody's saying that Lindsay Lohan 
lied and she said that her bracelet went

2363
01:41:19,631 --> 01:41:21,970
off because she was drinking that 
Kombucha.

2364
01:41:22,230 --> 01:41:24,470
Kombucha has a,
there's a level of alcohol,

2365
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:29,500
there's something going on with that 
because it was pulled off the shelves 

2366
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:33,391
off a whole foods and uh,
there's some questioning about the 

2367
01:41:33,391 --> 01:41:35,220
alcohol content that it's less than

2368
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:36,810
one half of a percent,
right?

2369
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:41,840
You don't have to mark it,
but if it's more than one half of a 

2370
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,061
percent,
you have to market and they're saying 

2371
01:41:44,061 --> 01:41:44,061
it's more.

2372
01:41:44,061 --> 01:41:46,190
Right.
So she was wearing winter this scam 

2373
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:47,940
bracelets and it went off and supposedly
that's what made it go off.

2374
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:50,790
Now I don't know if that's true or not,
but

2375
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:55,860
you know,
they say that you're not even supposed 

2376
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:55,860
to have any Kombucha.
If you're an alcoholic,

2377
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:56,980
you're not supposed to drink that shit.
Even taste like alcohol,

2378
01:41:57,010 --> 01:41:57,550
you know,
it does.

2379
01:41:57,551 --> 01:41:58,540
You know,
I was rolling.

2380
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:00,990
I did Jujitsu after I drank one and this
dude's head.

2381
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:03,110
Did you have a beer before you went to 
juices and.

2382
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:04,240
No,
drinking Kombucha.

2383
01:42:04,241 --> 01:42:05,610
It's all healthy and shit.
Right?

2384
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:08,230
But I mean maybe it has this little tiny
bit of alcohol in it,

2385
01:42:08,231 --> 01:42:10,180
but I've never gotten drunk off it or 
even felt a buzz.

2386
01:42:10,181 --> 01:42:12,610
But I'll tell you one thing man.
It's pumped.

2387
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:14,860
My fucking immune system are through the
roof.

2388
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,210
Yeah.
Don't get sick anymore.

2389
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:16,900
How many do you have?
A day?

2390
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:17,830
One.
At least two.

2391
01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:18,690
Wow.
Yeah,

2392
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:20,710
a drink like two a day.
All the time.

2393
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,150
I love them.
I'd fuck it.

2394
01:42:22,151 --> 01:42:23,740
I think they're delicious.
Do you like the regular?

2395
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:24,820
The best?
I like the regular.

2396
01:42:24,821 --> 01:42:25,500
That's my favorite.
Yeah.

2397
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:27,250
I'm not a big fan of that.
That other one?

2398
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,150
No,
they're great.

2399
01:42:28,151 --> 01:42:31,840
One to show gingerade the Ginger Ale.
I like this kind of strong.

2400
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:33,490
It's got a kick to it,
but the regular ones.

2401
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:35,230
Fantastic.
But I'm telling you man,

2402
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:38,080
all this travel I do.
I was getting sick all the time.

2403
01:42:38,081 --> 01:42:40,870
It was like every couple months I was 
battling and I'm still working out.

2404
01:42:40,930 --> 01:42:42,100
Right.
I'm still training,

2405
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:45,250
I'm working out as hard as I've ever 
worked out and I'm not getting sick.

2406
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:48,040
It's crazy and I think it has to do with
the probiotics,

2407
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:50,710
staying really regular with your 
vitamins.

2408
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:55,740
That's very important,
but it's also maintaining a healthy 

2409
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:58,051
bacteria level in your body.
Acidophilus and probiotic drinks on the 

2410
01:42:58,051 --> 01:43:02,701
road.
I take the acidophilus with me and I 

2411
01:43:02,701 --> 01:43:02,701
just,
you know,

2412
01:43:02,701 --> 01:43:05,161
take that.
And when I'm at home I drink those 

2413
01:43:05,161 --> 01:43:05,161
fucking drinks and I'm not getting sick.
It's crazy.

2414
01:43:05,161 --> 01:43:09,540
Yeah.
You're supposed to so many different 

2415
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:09,540
varieties of germs and bullshit when 
you're on the road.

2416
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:12,460
Plus I'm way more careful now,
but like washing my hands before I eat

2417
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:14,790
and strange.
Is that the creek we look at.

2418
01:43:15,030 --> 01:43:19,160
What about the job that got it?
The fucking the fetal this weekend.

2419
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:21,780
Let's,
let's talk about this.

2420
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:24,360
Is this is the bottom line failed or had
never fought.

2421
01:43:24,361 --> 01:43:25,010
A guy who's got a

2422
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,020
garlic for doom and who is he training 
with?

2423
01:43:27,021 --> 01:43:32,021
He's not training with anybody like is 
top of the food chain Abu Dhabi champion

2424
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:35,210
and he's a big man.
He's like six foot three,

2425
01:43:35,211 --> 01:43:35,900
six,
four.

2426
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:39,800
He's a big fucking dude and he's good.
His guard is nasty.

2427
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:41,300
He's got one of the best cars in the 
world.

2428
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:44,340
You try getting sloppy with grounded 
pound leave arms in there.

2429
01:43:44,341 --> 01:43:49,341
He got snatched those arms up quick and 
he's got a tight game and the beginning 

2430
01:43:49,341 --> 01:43:49,910
of the round Fado wasn't slippery yet.
You know,

2431
01:43:49,911 --> 01:43:52,250
no one's sweaty and they're just barely

2432
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:57,250
broken a sweat.
So He's got like a nice grip on a man 

2433
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:57,250
and you know,
we're doing man.

2434
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:59,390
You let them catch you and you in a 
technique battle.

2435
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:02,370
You battle his guard from,
from,

2436
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,460
you know when you're on top and you 
leave an arm in there,

2437
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:07,580
he's gonna fuck you up man.
Because as you go to defend,

2438
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:09,410
he set him up man.
And you know,

2439
01:44:09,411 --> 01:44:11,210
it was really beautiful to watch what he
did.

2440
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:15,350
He attacked the arm and as fate or is 
defending the arm,

2441
01:44:15,351 --> 01:44:18,440
he's got a pull the arm back.
So as he's defending the arm,

2442
01:44:18,441 --> 01:44:20,930
pull the arm back.
That's when he slaps a triangle on.

2443
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:26,000
It's like he just put him in a classic 
Brazilian Jujitsu chain of submissions.

2444
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:26,930
He went,
one,

2445
01:44:26,931 --> 01:44:28,460
you defend this.
He goes to that,

2446
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:30,590
and as you defend the triangle,
you expose the arm.

2447
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:32,990
As you protect the arm,
the triangle gets locked deeper.

2448
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:33,590
Bang,
Bang,

2449
01:44:33,591 --> 01:44:35,120
Bang.
It was beautiful man.

2450
01:44:35,121 --> 01:44:38,300
It was beautiful.
Look fate or is a bad motherfucker.

2451
01:44:38,301 --> 01:44:40,370
He's really like a guy who could fight 
at two.

2452
01:44:40,371 --> 01:44:41,810
Oh,
five easy.

2453
01:44:41,811 --> 01:44:44,120
And he's fighting at heavyweight 
knocking guys out.

2454
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:45,800
You know,
he's only six feet tall.

2455
01:44:45,801 --> 01:44:48,650
He's not a big guy.
Some people say he's actually only 5:11.

2456
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:53,950
He's not a big guy,
but he's incredibly talented and 

2457
01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:53,950
incredibly inspirational.
You know,

2458
01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:55,850
he's a,
he's a dude that makes people,

2459
01:44:55,970 --> 01:44:56,600
you know,
like,

2460
01:44:56,601 --> 01:44:57,440
excited,
you know,

2461
01:44:57,441 --> 01:45:02,441
they love the way he carries himself,
the way he handled the last man to hear 

2462
01:45:02,441 --> 01:45:02,630
what he said afterwards.
I said,

2463
01:45:02,631 --> 01:45:03,190
how do you feel?
Right?

2464
01:45:03,191 --> 01:45:04,990
And he says,
I feel nothing goes [inaudible] you.

2465
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,290
Uh,
you can't stand it.

2466
01:45:06,291 --> 01:45:06,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

2467
01:45:06,981 --> 01:45:11,981
You have to.
People who don't fall don't know what 

2468
01:45:11,981 --> 01:45:11,981
it's like to stand.
When was his last fight?

2469
01:45:11,981 --> 01:45:12,380
Like main fight before?

2470
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:13,610
That wasn't like seven years ago or 
something.

2471
01:45:13,611 --> 01:45:15,160
We don't know.
What are people saying?

2472
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:18,310
You know he beat Brett Rogers less than 
a shit.

2473
01:45:18,370 --> 01:45:20,280
It was only a few months ago.
Months ago.

2474
01:45:20,810 --> 01:45:23,540
Less than probably a blast and I'm 
knocked him out,

2475
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:28,750
but right after he beat them,
Alistair overeem beat the fuck out of 

2476
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:31,040
Brett Rogers.
Alistair overeem own bread.

2477
01:45:31,041 --> 01:45:31,700
Rogers.
He.

2478
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:34,400
The way he did it,
man was so precise on the feet,

2479
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:37,560
just high level.
Fucking Moitai tie.

2480
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:41,270
Slipping the punch and the Shin slams 
into the meat of the lake.

2481
01:45:41,450 --> 01:45:43,730
You could see like right away,
Brett Rogers like,

2482
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:46,250
oh fuck.
Like you could see right away.

2483
01:45:46,251 --> 01:45:47,720
He was in way,
way,

2484
01:45:47,721 --> 01:45:48,530
way,
way,

2485
01:45:48,531 --> 01:45:50,930
way over his head.
And then Alastar got Brett,

2486
01:45:50,931 --> 01:45:52,760
Raj on the ground and fucking pummeled 
them.

2487
01:45:52,761 --> 01:45:54,920
It moves.
It was a ridiculously one sided fight.

2488
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:56,900
What kind of party is Dana White having 
this weekend?

2489
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,620
It's having a big party and having a 
fucking laugh your ass off.

2490
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:05,330
I just saved $30,000,000
because now fate or unfortunately really

2491
01:46:05,331 --> 01:46:09,020
does become irrelevant because part of 
what made him exciting was the fact that

2492
01:46:09,021 --> 01:46:14,021
he was this undefeated guy who seemed to
be a superhuman and destroys tim.

2493
01:46:14,631 --> 01:46:17,870
Silvia destroys Andre Arlovski is like 
there's an aura about him.

2494
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:23,110
Some of the aura was eroded slightly by 
the Brett Rogers fight because Brett 

2495
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:24,340
Rogers got him down,
was grounded,

2496
01:46:24,350 --> 01:46:29,350
pounded him,
was connecting with big shots and you 

2497
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:29,350
looked at it and you're like,
what if brock got him in that spot?

2498
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:33,230
If Baraka Baraka named Brett Rogers pro 
brock gets you in that spot a,

2499
01:46:33,290 --> 01:46:34,790
you're not getting up.
B,

2500
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,530
you're going to eat some giant cinder 
block.

2501
01:46:36,531 --> 01:46:40,500
Fucking canned ham fists this weekend.
They're going to be crazy limitations.

2502
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:41,090
So I,
I,

2503
01:46:41,091 --> 01:46:46,091
so anyway,
that eroded people's confidence in fate 

2504
01:46:46,091 --> 01:46:46,130
or a little bit,
but what eroded my confidence,

2505
01:46:46,131 --> 01:46:49,320
and it is when I saw the way alice star 
handled Brett Rogers,

2506
01:46:49,321 --> 01:46:50,150
I knew Alastar

2507
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:55,180
was going to fuck bro,
but I didn't know he's going to do it 

2508
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:55,740
like that.
The way he did it was perfect.

2509
01:46:55,741 --> 01:46:56,430
I mean,
he just,

2510
01:46:56,490 --> 01:46:59,780
he shows how high level,
his striking is me beat Badr Hari,

2511
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:04,790
not Badr Hari Out,
who is one of the very best kick boxers 

2512
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:04,790
in the world,
you know,

2513
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:05,670
he's,
he's beaten a lot of dudes.

2514
01:47:05,671 --> 01:47:07,710
He fucked up Peter Hertz,
you know,

2515
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:09,180
he,
he knocks dudes out,

2516
01:47:09,181 --> 01:47:14,181
man.
He's a bad motherfucker in kickboxing 

2517
01:47:14,181 --> 01:47:14,181
with the best in the world,
you know,

2518
01:47:14,181 --> 01:47:15,920
he's hanging with those guys.
So when he got in there again,

2519
01:47:15,921 --> 01:47:17,880
it's like an MMA fighter who's just a 
brawler.

2520
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:20,460
He just opened up a can on them and you 
know,

2521
01:47:20,670 --> 01:47:25,670
fate or is not a technical striker.
He's very explosive and very fast and 

2522
01:47:25,670 --> 01:47:27,450
you know,
he's good and tough and his technique is

2523
01:47:27,451 --> 01:47:32,451
good,
but he's not like a guy who could just 

2524
01:47:32,451 --> 01:47:32,451
step into k one the way our star does.

2525
01:47:32,451 --> 01:47:34,530
And Alastar has a nasty ground game as 
well.

2526
01:47:34,531 --> 01:47:37,470
So the transition between the two of 
them is very smooth.

2527
01:47:37,471 --> 01:47:39,840
And when he took Brett Rogers down,
he just controlled him on the ground and

2528
01:47:39,841 --> 01:47:43,140
beat the fuck out of him.
He really made a mockery over Faye doors

2529
01:47:43,141 --> 01:47:43,800
when,
I mean,

2530
01:47:43,801 --> 01:47:45,060
it wasn't,
you know,

2531
01:47:45,670 --> 01:47:47,070
I mean,
obviously it wasn't the same night.

2532
01:47:47,071 --> 01:47:49,620
It's not the same circumstances,
but the way he beat him,

2533
01:47:49,621 --> 01:47:50,370
I was like,
man,

2534
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:55,790
you know,
Alastar to me is more exciting really 

2535
01:47:55,790 --> 01:47:57,951
right now than Fader al stores.
That's one of the scariest guys in the 

2536
01:47:57,951 --> 01:47:57,951
divisionK.
,

2537
01:47:57,951 --> 01:48:02,330
one level,
high level striking and nasty Brazilian 

2538
01:48:02,330 --> 01:48:02,330
Jujitsu one,
the,

2539
01:48:02,330 --> 01:48:04,830
uh,
European Abu Dhabi trials submitted Vito

2540
01:48:04,830 --> 01:48:06,780
Belfort instead of fucking sick.
He a team man,

2541
01:48:06,810 --> 01:48:09,090
what do you think fader or would have to
do to earn back?

2542
01:48:09,091 --> 01:48:09,870
You're like,
wow,

2543
01:48:09,871 --> 01:48:12,420
that is on top of his game.
Like who would he have to fight with?

2544
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:17,420
You have to go to the UFC now or you'd 
have to go to the UFC and I've or fight 

2545
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:18,930
Alastar and then go to the UFC,
but in for doom again too.

2546
01:48:18,931 --> 01:48:20,670
I mean,
I'm excited to see him fight anybody.

2547
01:48:20,671 --> 01:48:22,860
It's not that I'm not afraid or fan.
I love him,

2548
01:48:22,861 --> 01:48:25,890
but I think you've got to fight the best
guys in the world.

2549
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:30,980
You got to be in the heat with the best 
guys in the world and there's really no 

2550
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:31,800
shortcuts for that.
There's no shortcuts for,

2551
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:34,700
for training with a guy like for real 
silver dome.

2552
01:48:34,710 --> 01:48:37,410
There's no shortcuts to learning how to 
get out of a guard like that.

2553
01:48:37,470 --> 01:48:40,300
You've got to experience it and it's 
pretty obvious watching that fight that,

2554
01:48:40,301 --> 01:48:41,280
you know,
he probably hadn't,

2555
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:42,930
hadn't experienced that kind of shit 
before,

2556
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:43,950
you know,
I mean,

2557
01:48:43,951 --> 01:48:45,840
he was,
he's made some critical errors.

2558
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:51,050
There's a beautiful video where I'm 
Henry Gracie and his brother breakdown 

2559
01:48:51,050 --> 01:48:52,800
what would fade or did wrong and what 
we're doing.

2560
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:55,200
It was playing the triangle as 
beautiful,

2561
01:48:55,410 --> 01:48:56,250
you know,
and it's like,

2562
01:48:56,270 --> 01:48:57,480
you know,
people are looking at and they're like,

2563
01:48:57,481 --> 01:49:02,481
this is like simple Jujitsu.
He made mistakes and part of these mix 

2564
01:49:02,481 --> 01:49:05,720
tapes,
because he's got a very unorthodox 

2565
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:07,191
style.
He throws big haymakers inside the 

2566
01:49:07,191 --> 01:49:07,191
guard.
He's been really successful with that.

2567
01:49:07,191 --> 01:49:08,700
But with a guy like for doom,
you can't do that.

2568
01:49:08,701 --> 01:49:09,480
He,
he's just,

2569
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:12,150
he's there to catch those little tiny,
tiny openings,

2570
01:49:12,151 --> 01:49:14,120
you know,
he put a beating on him that,

2571
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,140
you know what it was really exciting 
about that nightmare.

2572
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:20,690
Kung Lee is bringing a taekwondo back 
country,

2573
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:25,020
has that fucking step in turning 
sidekick.

2574
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:30,290
He stands in a southpaw stance with his 
right leg forward and he throws a left 

2575
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:33,030
like steps for throwing a left and dudes
back out of the way,

2576
01:49:33,031 --> 01:49:36,330
just of the punch,
but at turning sidekick comes behind it.

2577
01:49:36,331 --> 01:49:40,650
So it's a 360 degree turning sidekick.
He stands with his right leg forward,

2578
01:49:40,770 --> 01:49:43,000
throws the lefthand,
and as he throws the lefthand,

2579
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:46,020
he steps forward with the left foot and 
then spins.

2580
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:48,370
So there's so much momentum and he's 
like running

2581
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:52,060
at you with that kick and blasts you 
his.

2582
01:49:52,090 --> 01:49:55,360
He's doing shit with kicks man that 
other people aren't doing.

2583
01:49:55,390 --> 01:50:00,390
And that's one of them.
The way he throws that three 60 turning 

2584
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:00,390
sidekick.
I don't see anybody else doing that.

2585
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:04,471
If you guys do a turning sidekick,
but I don't see anybody else doing that 

2586
01:50:04,471 --> 01:50:07,900
three 60 like he does it and his kicks 
are fucking deadly man.

2587
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:10,150
There was a lot of high kicks to,
you know.

2588
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:14,510
What do you think for this weekend so 
far they're sucking.

2589
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:19,600
Talk less.
There's a lot of fights I'm excited 

2590
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:19,600
about on this card.
How about Chris?

2591
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:22,330
Lionel versus Matt?
The shit that man,

2592
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:24,760
that motherfucker that fight has fight 
of the night.

2593
01:50:24,761 --> 01:50:27,550
Written all over at both guys are 
savages.

2594
01:50:27,820 --> 01:50:30,550
Brown is a fucking savage.
And Chris Lidell no.

2595
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:32,500
Back Down to shit.
Chris Lidell.

2596
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:34,180
I've never even seen that guy get 
rocked.

2597
01:50:34,510 --> 01:50:39,510
I've seen them get busted open and 
bloody and smashed in the face and hit 

2598
01:50:39,510 --> 01:50:41,200
with Haymakers,
but he always just bounces right back.

2599
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:44,680
That dude's Chin has made us a meant.
Here's a fucking monster.

2600
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,440
And Him and Matt Brown.
Matt Brown as a warrior.

2601
01:50:47,441 --> 01:50:49,720
Do that guy go fucking fuck.
I strong.

2602
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:51,850
His mind is strong too.
He represses.

2603
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:56,900
He keeps taze onto it and breaks dudes.
So him in Lidl is just a guaranteed 

2604
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,330
fucking guaranteed.
Tons of fun.

2605
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:00,550
By the way.
Mad props to the UFC,

2606
01:51:00,551 --> 01:51:02,710
his new website.
That's fucking amazing.

2607
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:07,740
You like that?
It's fucking awesome if you don't think 

2608
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:07,740
it's too much flash.
Uh,

2609
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:08,890
well,
I mean it's one of those fund websites,

2610
01:51:08,891 --> 01:51:09,450
you know,
like,

2611
01:51:09,490 --> 01:51:12,770
I mean it's kind missed the old one.
Yeah.

2612
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:17,800
Like I liked the,
I mean there's not a choice to do just 

2613
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:17,800
the basic,
like a blog or something like that.

2614
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:23,070
It's pretty dope though.
When you do see like the different 

2615
01:51:23,070 --> 01:51:24,130
fighters and you're like they focus on 
each frame and match up.

2616
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:26,530
It's there like big closeup pictures and
shit.

2617
01:51:26,531 --> 01:51:27,720
And that is Flash,
Huh?

2618
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:29,860
Yeah.
It's unfortunate that it's flash,

2619
01:51:29,861 --> 01:51:31,210
but uh,
it's pretty sweet.

2620
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:33,310
I like it.
They could have done the same thing with

2621
01:51:33,311 --> 01:51:38,311
html five.
I'm sure there probably is a way to do 

2622
01:51:38,311 --> 01:51:39,010
that and that way you could get it on 
your ipad or your iphone.

2623
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:44,100
Right?
Because right now you can't write what 

2624
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:44,190
the fun stuff that's not like 
informative,

2625
01:51:45,290 --> 01:51:48,250
like DVD extras when you want to be able
to get that on your phone.

2626
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:50,440
Yeah,
I guess it's just not.

2627
01:51:50,650 --> 01:51:52,660
It's cool to look at pictures and stuff.
I guess,

2628
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:57,750
isn't it crazy that porn is what's 
pushing the transition to html five when

2629
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:59,860
porn back something?
It's usually pretty legit.

2630
01:51:59,890 --> 01:52:01,090
You know?
Isn't that nuts?

2631
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:03,580
Fuck.
Is anybody still making money off porn?

2632
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:07,090
Know?
You know we've talked about this.

2633
01:52:07,091 --> 01:52:07,660
Yeah.
Tyler,

2634
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:08,880
no.
Tyler night.

2635
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:10,180
That dude,
he's um,

2636
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:12,820
he's making a transition to becoming an 
author.

2637
01:52:12,821 --> 01:52:17,821
He's a really good writer.
He wrote some really fucked up shit if 

2638
01:52:17,821 --> 01:52:19,000
you don't know what his blog is,
but it just look up tyler night blog,

2639
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:22,030
you'll find it online and tyler is a 
really good writer,

2640
01:52:22,031 --> 01:52:26,980
but he's got some ridiculous stories 
about porno sets and scenes and he's got

2641
01:52:26,981 --> 01:52:31,180
a story about failing at a boot khaki 
khaki event.

2642
01:52:31,181 --> 01:52:34,420
Whereas like literally hundreds of dudes
are fucking this chick and you know,

2643
01:52:34,421 --> 01:52:39,421
he's in line with all these dudes and 
he's trying to keep his dick hard and 

2644
01:52:39,421 --> 01:52:42,181
right.
And he gets somebody totally fails and 

2645
01:52:42,181 --> 01:52:42,181
stepping,
stepping other dudes loads.

2646
01:52:42,181 --> 01:52:45,230
There's loads every.
It's so dark,

2647
01:52:45,231 --> 01:52:46,580
but it's so well written too.

2648
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:49,650
It's just really awesome stuff.
But having all true,

2649
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:52,350
I would have those,
a pool shoes and slippers that you.

2650
01:52:53,770 --> 01:52:55,880
How about cleats?
Cleats would be better,

2651
01:52:55,881 --> 01:53:00,881
so softball cleats.
Just dig your way through the fucking 

2652
01:53:00,881 --> 01:53:01,820
sticky loads.
What the fuck?

2653
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:03,740
But this guy was in the porn business 
forever,

2654
01:53:03,741 --> 01:53:08,741
man and had some great,
great stories about the porn business 

2655
01:53:08,741 --> 01:53:10,460
and now he's just writing,
you know and shit.

2656
01:53:10,461 --> 01:53:14,210
Just stories about the porn business can
keep me fascinated for years.

2657
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:17,960
That's a crazy business dude and he's a 
regular really cool.

2658
01:53:17,961 --> 01:53:22,961
Nice guy.
Do you ever see the cosby's episode or 

2659
01:53:22,961 --> 01:53:25,190
the Cosby's porno?
Thomas Ward.

2660
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:27,830
Thomas Ward.
I hang out with that dude two weeks ago.

2661
01:53:28,570 --> 01:53:33,570
Where was he at?
The comedy store with one of his porn 

2662
01:53:33,570 --> 01:53:33,570
star friends.
Real and she was like,

2663
01:53:33,570 --> 01:53:36,560
I needed their contacts and she's all 
like all in my face and I'm like,

2664
01:53:36,561 --> 01:53:38,750
oh,
you smell like crack and Doritos.

2665
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:41,900
Crack and Doritos and VD.
Yeah.

2666
01:53:41,990 --> 01:53:44,360
Oh she was Thomas Ward is a really funny
guy.

2667
01:53:44,361 --> 01:53:46,400
Man.
Thomas Ward was another guy that like.

2668
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:48,650
I always was like,
how come Thomas Ward didn't hit?

2669
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,570
How come?
How come you didn't make it?

2670
01:53:50,810 --> 01:53:52,010
He's loving it now,
man.

2671
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:54,230
It seems like he's.
Looks like he's living large now.

2672
01:53:54,290 --> 01:53:55,340
He's doing porn.
Yeah,

2673
01:53:55,400 --> 01:54:00,400
he's winning awards and stuff.
I don't think he actually does the porn 

2674
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:01,380
part though.
He just does like acting in porn.

2675
01:54:01,450 --> 01:54:03,110
But he's like winning,
winning awards.

2676
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:04,330
Winning porn awards.
Yeah.

2677
01:54:04,370 --> 01:54:06,050
Do those count.
They do count.

2678
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:08,540
Joey.
Joey,

2679
01:54:08,541 --> 01:54:13,541
we lost him still.
I was in said my blood sugars down the 

2680
01:54:13,541 --> 01:54:17,200
air conditioning is what's my air 
conditioning is broke in my office.

2681
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:20,690
It's being replaced on Tuesday.
So what's today?

2682
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:21,890
Wednesday?
Tuesday.

2683
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:24,430
Tomorrow.
You gotta wait a week to week you.

2684
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:26,210
They got to order all the parts and all 
that shit.

2685
01:54:26,211 --> 01:54:27,090
So there's no,

2686
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:27,880

no,

2687
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:28,220
no,
no.

2688
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:29,880
The House has there.
Just not my office.

2689
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:33,950
And he opened the back window.
Yeah.

2690
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:39,700
It gets hot as fuck in the valley.
That's one of the things I miss about 

2691
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:41,040
Colorado and never really got that hot.
My house in Colorado,

2692
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:43,250
no need for air conditioning.
Ever Tie.

2693
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:44,900
Just opened up a window.
Beautiful.

2694
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:49,930
Clean Mountain air.
Have some fucking tap water in your tap 

2695
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:50,210
water is uh.
Well how about that?

2696
01:54:50,211 --> 01:54:52,550
Sun and drinking water out of a fucking 
stream.

2697
01:54:52,551 --> 01:54:53,240
It's in the earth.

2698
01:54:57,200 --> 01:55:00,810
So when I moved back to Colorado,
but Mrs Rogan,

2699
01:55:00,811 --> 01:55:05,360
so not down for getting another dog 
eaten by a monster in the woods.

2700
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:10,960
That's what chloroforms for chloroform,
the fucking dog and chloroforms for it 

2701
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:13,150
and what's not.
Wake up.

2702
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:15,080
Where are we?
You're in California.

2703
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:17,400
You can't live with someone and kidnap 
him.

2704
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:19,820
Moving to another state.
Especially with babies and shit.

2705
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:23,040
It's a lot of work through the 
chloroform run is.

2706
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:24,530
Wait,
where are you at this weekend?

2707
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:27,200
What are you doing this weekend?
I got a couple of shows Friday.

2708
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:28,520
Tell people where to where they can see 
it.

2709
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:30,560
Sounds comedy.
Motherfucking whole.

2710
01:55:30,730 --> 01:55:31,350
Yeah.
Sounds.

2711
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:33,580
Comedy is a new place that I want to 
check it out.

2712
01:55:36,410 --> 01:55:38,130
Tell me about this place on labrea 
cells.

2713
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:40,730
Comedy horror.
You've been there twice though.

2714
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:44,190
Whereas this is very avant garde.
Libray and melrose.

2715
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:46,500
Melrose.
I guess that's where it is.

2716
01:55:46,501 --> 01:55:48,310
What are you asking me fucking because I
want to know about it.

2717
01:55:48,311 --> 01:55:50,160
I've never been there before.
It's a new place in that way.

2718
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:52,200
Just give me some prompts.
I'm fucking tired.

2719
01:55:52,201 --> 01:55:53,520
Let's go get a sausage and peppers 
saying,

2720
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:54,920
oh,
Joey died.

2721
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:55,720
He faded.
Honestly.

2722
01:55:56,770 --> 01:55:58,650
Imagine that,
imagine if your job,

2723
01:55:58,651 --> 01:56:02,880
if you can fall asleep after two hours.
So it's a good spot though.

2724
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:03,920
Comedy,
hold on.

2725
01:56:03,930 --> 01:56:06,060
Friday night,
late night.

2726
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:07,730
I have no fucking idea.
He's going to call it.

2727
01:56:07,731 --> 01:56:09,810
Okay,
so call sales comedy whole.

2728
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,740
I don't even give a fuck.
Don't call comedy.

2729
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:12,720
Hold.
Don't bother me.

2730
01:56:12,721 --> 01:56:17,721
I'm going to the Improv and someone's in
La and they're looking for some comedy 

2731
01:56:17,721 --> 01:56:20,730
late night show at the Improv,
which are the level two weekends.

2732
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:22,290
Ten o'clock.
Friday,

2733
01:56:22,291 --> 01:56:23,820
10.
That's the refi beans?

2734
01:56:23,821 --> 01:56:24,960
Yes.
Okay.

2735
01:56:25,390 --> 01:56:28,650
So what time is your spot?
I have no idea when you're on that show,

2736
01:56:28,651 --> 01:56:31,590
so if you want to see some good comedy,
go to the Improv.

2737
01:56:31,591 --> 01:56:32,340
Ten,
10:00

2738
01:56:32,341 --> 01:56:37,341
show.
Friday night joe is will be there and 

2739
01:56:37,341 --> 01:56:41,030
Brian and I will be a w at the Vegas,
a house of Blues on Friday night.

2740
01:56:41,941 --> 01:56:46,941
Me and Sam Tripoli and then on Saturday 
we're going to go to the UFC Saturday.

2741
01:56:47,650 --> 01:56:49,940
It's from your sponsor and all that 
stuff.

2742
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:55,820
I can't wait for.
What do you think's gonna happen when 

2743
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:55,820
Shankar wouldn't brock lives now?
I've been thinking about it.

2744
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:58,800
I think Brock Lesnar is going to win 
this first round.

2745
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:00,300
First round.
Huh?

2746
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:01,740
What do you think?
Take them down.

2747
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:04,260
Pound on them.
Hound them to death and it's going to be

2748
01:57:04,261 --> 01:57:05,760
stopped.
Do you think that uh,

2749
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:07,890
Shane Carlin won't be able to stop brock
from taking them down?

2750
01:57:07,891 --> 01:57:12,891
Yeah,
I think is just a monster and you can't 

2751
01:57:12,891 --> 01:57:14,931
stop when that fist is coming at you and
it's just gonna keep on coming and I 

2752
01:57:14,931 --> 01:57:15,240
think he's just going to get smashed 
brained.

2753
01:57:15,450 --> 01:57:16,210
Really?
Yup.

2754
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:21,440
So you don't.
What about the fact that chain car one 

2755
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:21,440
is literally.
I mean physically at least on paper,

2756
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:22,120
the same size,
you know,

2757
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:25,750
it weighs the same amount and he's 
knocked out every single person bro.

2758
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:26,960
It's a fucking different dance.

2759
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:32,040
He's a big debts.
There's a big fucking rock has been 

2760
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:32,040
there before.
You know,

2761
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:34,860
how was a big fucking dead rock is so 
competitive and he really feels that.

2762
01:57:34,861 --> 01:57:39,861
I bet he needs to come back.
He's just got a lot of time to think 

2763
01:57:39,861 --> 01:57:41,770
about shit and a lot of training to do 
and he's just,

2764
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:46,820
he's gonna.
He's gonna probably be more ready now 

2765
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:46,820
than he's ever been in his life.
I thought,

2766
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:46,820
well,
you know,

2767
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:48,600
he's not even cutting weight is walking 
around at like two 65.

2768
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:50,490
He's lost weight,
but fat.

2769
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:55,790
He's like ripped.
It was looking really good chicken like 

2770
01:57:55,790 --> 01:57:57,690
his,
his mass is thick because now he's on 

2771
01:57:57,690 --> 01:57:57,690
this really a vegetable diet and you 
know,

2772
01:57:57,690 --> 01:58:02,270
high in fiber and you know Broccoli and 
shit like that to go along with the 

2773
01:58:02,270 --> 01:58:06,831
meat.
So he's got this diet that's like a 

2774
01:58:06,831 --> 01:58:06,831
cleaner diet and he watches his food.

2775
01:58:06,831 --> 01:58:10,910
Like the countdown show was pretty 
interesting when we were talking about 

2776
01:58:10,910 --> 01:58:10,920
him coming back and they started out 
nice and slow.

2777
01:58:11,190 --> 01:58:16,190
He worked out,
they made sure his heartbeat heart rate 

2778
01:58:16,190 --> 01:58:18,531
didn't go over certain beats per minute 
and then they slowly built them back so 

2779
01:58:18,531 --> 01:58:18,900
they could see the beast return,
you know?

2780
01:58:18,901 --> 01:58:23,901
And then before,
you know what he's fucking 280 pounds 

2781
01:58:23,901 --> 01:58:23,901
again,
throwing people around.

2782
01:58:23,901 --> 01:58:27,140
That'd be funny.
If his tattoo grew like ets flower got 

2783
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:27,210
dead,
you know?

2784
01:58:27,211 --> 01:58:30,570
But anyway,
what if someone actually tattooed a dick

2785
01:58:30,571 --> 01:58:32,550
on their chest just like it?
No.

2786
01:58:32,610 --> 01:58:36,120
Look at Dick like no question at all.
Like a dick.

2787
01:58:36,150 --> 01:58:41,150
Would they let them fight in the UFC?
What if you got a guy like Hector 

2788
01:58:41,150 --> 01:58:41,150
Lombard who's like the,
uh,

2789
01:58:41,150 --> 01:58:45,970
bellatore champion,
very highly touted middleweight one of 

2790
01:58:45,970 --> 01:58:48,811
the best in the world.
But what if a guy like that level 

2791
01:58:48,811 --> 01:58:51,390
decided to Kinda like go me would've 
gotten me cable into the UFC and he 

2792
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:51,390
tattooed a dick on his chest.

2793
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:51,830
Probably make them cover it up,
you know,

2794
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:52,960
how are you making.
I cover it up.

2795
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:56,720
They have makeup there was in the way 
and put makeup on fight Madison.

2796
01:58:57,020 --> 01:58:59,480
It would take marker,
maybe like permanent marker.

2797
01:58:59,610 --> 01:59:00,210
Mark.
Draw.

2798
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:02,350
Make it look like a person that someone 
did that.

2799
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:04,150
Um,
from the uh,

2800
01:59:04,151 --> 01:59:05,980
the wolf's lair.
What the fuck is his name?

2801
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:07,390
Shit.
God,

2802
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,770
goddammit.
You know,

2803
01:59:08,771 --> 01:59:11,290
it'd be awesome if a fighter came out,
the English guy,

2804
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:13,300
Paul Kelly,
Paul Teles,

2805
01:59:13,301 --> 01:59:13,930
Kelly,
he,

2806
01:59:13,931 --> 01:59:14,680
um,
he had,

2807
01:59:14,681 --> 01:59:19,681
he left the wolf's lair so he had like 
marker and he put a big x across the 

2808
01:59:19,751 --> 01:59:22,900
wolf's lair on his back because he had 
tattooed the wolf's lair on his back.

2809
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:28,380
You know,
it'd be awesome what a fighter shit do 

2810
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:29,910
what as they said,
draw all over their face that make it 

2811
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:30,190
look like they passed out at a party,
you know,

2812
01:59:30,191 --> 01:59:31,990
like,
like have dicks and Cox,

2813
01:59:32,130 --> 01:59:33,520
those chemicals on your skin.

2814
01:59:33,550 --> 01:59:34,990
You can get someone's.
I would sweat.

2815
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:37,840
You can't do that.
He can't put anything on you.

2816
01:59:37,841 --> 01:59:40,450
Not even mean.
That's why after the GSP,

2817
01:59:40,451 --> 01:59:43,210
Bj Penn fight corners aren't even 
allowed to put vaseline on.

2818
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:45,820
They have to cut man and have to do it.
And they control it.

2819
01:59:46,140 --> 01:59:47,110
Huh?
Yeah.

2820
01:59:47,111 --> 01:59:48,330
It's um.
I don't know.

2821
01:59:48,870 --> 01:59:50,530
What if someone did though,
what if someone did,

2822
01:59:50,590 --> 01:59:53,470
do you think that would be you can't 
fight made event fight main event,

2823
01:59:53,510 --> 01:59:56,920
fight big event like a Tesla car when 
type thing like GSP,

2824
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:02,280
GSP is going to have this fucking big 
crazy fight coming up with Josh 

2825
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:02,280
Koscheck.
Right.

2826
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:02,570
You know,
and as you know,

2827
02:00:02,590 --> 02:00:07,590
he steps into the octagon.
He realized GSP has got a big dick 

2828
02:00:07,590 --> 02:00:08,050
tattooed on his chest,
a real dick vein,

2829
02:00:08,051 --> 02:00:09,550
a black one,
a black dick.

2830
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:13,960
He just got crazy and just decided to 
give something to,

2831
02:00:13,980 --> 02:00:16,560
you know,
my idea is to distract people.

2832
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:20,170
They concentrated on the book Dick,
you know,

2833
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:22,300
somewhere in the contract.
You're not allowed to do that.

2834
02:00:22,301 --> 02:00:24,620
Yeah.
Probably no black dicks in your chest.

2835
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:26,220
Think so.
Yeah.

2836
02:00:26,810 --> 02:00:28,450
It was probably something like that.
To find that out.

2837
02:00:28,451 --> 02:00:28,990
Why?
Guess?

2838
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:30,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

2839
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:32,980
I don't even want to ask them though,
because then looking.

2840
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,360
Why the fuck are you asking me this?

2841
02:00:36,910 --> 02:00:37,520
You.
Hi.

2842
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:40,330
We're going to start testing.
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,

2843
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:45,720
that's about two hours.
So a Joey Diaz is a starving for a 

2844
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:47,520
sausage and pepper sandwich.
Old School,

2845
02:00:47,650 --> 02:00:50,050
like there's the give you a north Bergen
Bergen.

2846
02:00:50,051 --> 02:00:51,850
You go down to get a fucking sausage and
pepper.

2847
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:54,400
You can't even get that shit.
These fucking half a fax.

2848
02:00:54,401 --> 02:00:57,910
They can make a god damn sandwich.
I want a fucking sausage and pepper.

2849
02:00:58,090 --> 02:01:00,670
We'll peppers and fucking Marinara 
sauce.

2850
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:02,920
What?
What's this flashlight thing?

2851
02:01:02,921 --> 02:01:03,880
Joey ideas.
Oh,

2852
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:08,710
the mom totally got to do a word for the
fucking sponsor.

2853
02:01:08,711 --> 02:01:11,230
I've been telling you that we're a half 
hour character.

2854
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:14,730
This motherfucker stop fucking your 
hand.

2855
02:01:14,990 --> 02:01:15,880
No,
that's fine.

2856
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,720
Is the fleshlight a word from our 
sponsor?

2857
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:21,760
We've got to keep the lights on.
Ladies and gentlemen.

2858
02:01:21,761 --> 02:01:25,540
The way we do it is run by assholes.
That's what we do is keep the lights on.

2859
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:27,520
It's soft.
It's wonderful.

2860
02:01:27,521 --> 02:01:29,950
It feels good.
If you leave it out in the sun,

2861
02:01:29,951 --> 02:01:31,440
it gets warm.
Have you can.

2862
02:01:31,470 --> 02:01:35,680
You can.
You can also put it in a tub full of hot

2863
02:01:35,681 --> 02:01:40,681
water.
That's a good move to fill the tub with 

2864
02:01:40,681 --> 02:01:40,681
hot water bath tub with them.
Then

2865
02:01:40,681 --> 02:01:42,680
you squirt some lube,
put some lube in there,

2866
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:45,500
and then you stick your erect penis and 
then you'll like this.

2867
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:50,690
I ain't even thought about doing it in 
the shower.

2868
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:53,510
The only problem with the flashlight is 
as much of a losers.

2869
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:57,050
You feel like when you jerk off,
you feel like five times more of a loser

2870
02:01:57,051 --> 02:02:00,920
when you nut into a rubber pussy,
you just feel like a fucking idiot,

2871
02:02:01,790 --> 02:02:04,700
but it's an outstanding product.
It's not like I'm gonna stop using it,

2872
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:07,820
but you do feel completely ridiculous.
Like if somebody caught you beating off,

2873
02:02:07,821 --> 02:02:12,821
that'd be one thing,
but if you know your girl walks in and 

2874
02:02:12,821 --> 02:02:13,790
you're like what you're putting into a 
rubber pussy,

2875
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:18,920
you're one of the most ridiculous things
you could ever get busted doing.

2876
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:20,560
Yeah.
Fucking a rubber posing.

2877
02:02:20,830 --> 02:02:22,640
A real doll would probably be way worse.
So.

2878
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:23,170
Yeah.
No,

2879
02:02:23,171 --> 02:02:24,290
that'd be totally way worse.

2880
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:26,960
At least this way you like,
I know it's not a person.

2881
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:32,280
I'm just watching porn have beaten off a
real doll is really kind of fucking 

2882
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:35,621
useless when you think about it.
How dumb do you have to be to really 

2883
02:02:35,621 --> 02:02:36,110
think that you were having sex and I 
would want one just to drive around with

2884
02:02:36,111 --> 02:02:38,050
in the car and do practical jokes and 
stuff like that.

2885
02:02:38,051 --> 02:02:43,051
That's a good move.
But I think cops look now because I 

2886
02:02:43,051 --> 02:02:43,051
think people have done shit like that 
before.

2887
02:02:43,051 --> 02:02:44,090
I know people had been busted with masks
and stuff,

2888
02:02:44,091 --> 02:02:46,610
but if you put a fucking seat belt on 
that sunglasses,

2889
02:02:46,611 --> 02:02:48,590
there's no way that cops gonna know 
that's fake.

2890
02:02:48,591 --> 02:02:50,290
You know?
If you have tinted windows for short,

2891
02:02:50,291 --> 02:02:51,650
right?
Then there's nobody's gonna know,

2892
02:02:52,410 --> 02:02:53,000
put,
put,

2893
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:58,120
make it look like put a helmet on him 
and bandages and shit like he's the 

2894
02:02:58,120 --> 02:02:58,120
mommy.

2895
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:01,610
Like something bad happen to him or like
her outfit.

2896
02:03:02,210 --> 02:03:06,410
The cop's going to investigate you.
You're the worst criminal of all time.

2897
02:03:06,810 --> 02:03:10,280
All right.
This weekend Joe Diaz is at Sal's comedy

2898
02:03:10,281 --> 02:03:13,880
whole on Friday night and the 10:00
PM show at the Improv.

2899
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:16,100
Don't miss him.
It's epic.

2900
02:03:16,101 --> 02:03:18,770
Standup comedy.
It's real standup comedy.

2901
02:03:18,771 --> 02:03:19,670
Old School.
Joey,

2902
02:03:19,671 --> 02:03:21,590
we've got to make a fucking cd with you 
this year.

2903
02:03:21,591 --> 02:03:22,460
Okay.
Can we do that?

2904
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:25,730
We make a CD talking monkey productions.
I put that shit out.

2905
02:03:25,850 --> 02:03:29,530
Should we do a DVD or CD?
You should do a God damn DVD DVD.

2906
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:34,280
It pains me to know and the Joe Diaz 
does not have a naval.

2907
02:03:34,370 --> 02:03:37,070
This is going to be.
Even though you got a restraining order,

2908
02:03:37,071 --> 02:03:42,071
I'm still gonna fucking kill you.
That's the name of my app right there.

2909
02:03:43,070 --> 02:03:44,480
I like it.
I like it.

2910
02:03:44,481 --> 02:03:47,540
We will go with that or what else he 
decides tomorrow.

2911
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:49,190
Even though you don't have a restraining
order,

2912
02:03:49,191 --> 02:03:50,950
I'm still going to fucking kill you.
Let's,

2913
02:03:50,951 --> 02:03:53,800
let's plan this out right now.
People know where we're going to play,

2914
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:55,700
where we're going to do this.
Where should we do this?

2915
02:03:55,730 --> 02:03:57,070
Where should we do?
Do some with.

2916
02:03:57,170 --> 02:03:58,130
No,
we should do.

2917
02:03:58,160 --> 02:04:03,160
Here's what we should do.
We should I when I'm doing a weekend 

2918
02:04:03,160 --> 02:04:05,891
somewhere like a Dallas weekend or 
Austin or something like that where I'm 

2919
02:04:05,891 --> 02:04:08,540
doing Friday and Saturday and Sunday.
How about we fly in Thursday?

2920
02:04:08,690 --> 02:04:09,640
Okay.
We,

2921
02:04:09,660 --> 02:04:11,780
we,
we put it up on twitter and the Internet

2922
02:04:11,810 --> 02:04:14,770
and I host it and I bring you up to do 
it.

2923
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:15,620
I bring you up.

2924
02:04:17,710 --> 02:04:19,480
Okay,
so let's plan on doing that next time.

2925
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:24,660
One of the top videos that we shoot with
the tank next week in Burbank.

2926
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:26,670
That'll be,
that's what we'll do.

2927
02:04:26,720 --> 02:04:29,420
I'll host it,
will bring you up and we'll have,

2928
02:04:29,450 --> 02:04:32,180
you know,
you'll do like do 45 minutes in,

2929
02:04:32,181 --> 02:04:34,280
five minutes banging out and we'll have,
you know,

2930
02:04:34,350 --> 02:04:36,260
it'd be fucking perfect.
Get it.

2931
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:38,100
We need to do that.
We've been needing to do that for a long

2932
02:04:38,101 --> 02:04:43,101
time,
so if you need to see joey eventually 

2933
02:04:43,101 --> 02:04:43,101
gonna get to see them on DVD.
But for now,

2934
02:04:43,101 --> 02:04:44,640
go to see him.
If you're in La Sal,

2935
02:04:44,850 --> 02:04:48,780
sal's comedy whole Friday night and the 
Improv 10:00

2936
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:53,780
PM show.
If you want to see me House of Blues 

2937
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:57,390
Night in Vegas Dot Com.
It's going to be the shit,

2938
02:04:57,391 --> 02:04:59,100
the House of Blues and the House of 
Blues.

2939
02:04:59,101 --> 02:05:04,101
By the way,
if you've ever seen me there before and 

2940
02:05:04,101 --> 02:05:05,481
it was chaos.
We completely revamped the whole 

2941
02:05:05,481 --> 02:05:05,481
situation.

2942
02:05:05,481 --> 02:05:06,300
There's no more standing.
After we went to see doug,

2943
02:05:06,301 --> 02:05:11,301
Stan Hope Brian and I went to see Doug 
Stan hope and the army went to and it 

2944
02:05:11,301 --> 02:05:12,210
was so tiring.
Just standing up is awful.

2945
02:05:12,450 --> 02:05:13,710
It's hard.
I did not know.

2946
02:05:13,711 --> 02:05:18,711
Is that hard to watch a show?
I figured it was just like I'm standing 

2947
02:05:18,711 --> 02:05:18,711
on stage for an hour and a half.
I think it's no big deal.

2948
02:05:18,711 --> 02:05:19,830
Stand and watch,
but it's a big deal.

2949
02:05:19,831 --> 02:05:24,831
It's annoying as fuck.
Especially because when I'm on stage I 

2950
02:05:24,831 --> 02:05:27,181
can walk around and move and it doesn't 
feel so made me hate the comedy when 

2951
02:05:27,181 --> 02:05:29,430
you're standing and what you had to 
stand in one spot too.

2952
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:32,630
And I kept like moving my arms,
stretching my backstory,

2953
02:05:33,270 --> 02:05:35,310
not fun.
So I decided after that time,

2954
02:05:35,730 --> 02:05:38,580
no more standing room shows that we've 
made one mistake.

2955
02:05:38,610 --> 02:05:40,860
We did Memphis,
that one fucking show in Memphis,

2956
02:05:41,010 --> 02:05:42,420
which was a disaster,
right?

2957
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:47,440
There was fucking half the show was 
standing and it was all a bar and 

2958
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:48,320
everybody was talking at the top of 
their voice and it was,

2959
02:05:48,450 --> 02:05:51,090
there was no other venue available in 
benefits when we were there.

2960
02:05:51,091 --> 02:05:53,110
So we took it.
But when the,

2961
02:05:53,270 --> 02:05:55,740
when we do the house of blues now 
everybody seated.

2962
02:05:55,980 --> 02:06:00,980
So it,
it's like they had to cut out a few 

2963
02:06:00,980 --> 02:06:00,980
hundred tickets,
a few hundred seats because they used to

2964
02:06:00,980 --> 02:06:05,720
let people,
like a few hundred people stand over by 

2965
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:05,720
the bar area.
But it became a disaster.

2966
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:10,160
Everybody would talk and they would yell
shit out and they would annoy the fuck 

2967
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:10,740
out of the people that were sitting.
And so now it's sweet.

2968
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,240
It's nice.
Everyone's seated.

2969
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:15,690
So that is a 8:00
on Friday.

2970
02:06:15,870 --> 02:06:20,870
And then after that,
if you're around steel panthers at 

2971
02:06:20,870 --> 02:06:20,870
midnight,
we're gonna.

2972
02:06:20,870 --> 02:06:21,180
Go see that.
Two Steel Panther.

2973
02:06:21,181 --> 02:06:23,580
The fucking the rock show.
It's the shit.

2974
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:24,990
Yeah.
I can't wait.

2975
02:06:25,050 --> 02:06:26,010
Yeah,
it was going to be fun,

2976
02:06:26,030 --> 02:06:31,030
man.
God is the greatest Ozzy Osborne 

2977
02:06:31,030 --> 02:06:31,030
impression in the history of the 
universe.

2978
02:06:31,030 --> 02:06:31,030
All Right Ladies,
gentlemen,

2979
02:06:31,230 --> 02:06:33,960

podcast.

2980

We appreciate it.
And we will be back next week.

2981
02:06:36,870 --> 02:06:38,250
And uh,
that's it.

2982
02:06:38,310 --> 02:06:40,120
We love you bitches.
Made it black.
