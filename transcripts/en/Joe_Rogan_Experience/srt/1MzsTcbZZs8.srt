00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,390
Hello Freak bitches.
Do you get blood work done?

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,610
Um,
I haven't,

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,490
I,
I have uh,

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,750
I've got prescription to like measure
like all,

5
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:15,010
like my nutrient levels and I've just
been too lazy to go get it done.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,990
That's ridiculous though.
You're a professional at the highest

7
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:23,290
level of the game and I'm,
I'm an idiot.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,290
I don't know,
I just,

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,250
I just,
I'm a procrastinator with it because you

10
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:30,070
know,
one day I'll,

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,360
I'll feel like crappy and I'll be
talking to my osteopath.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,900
It'd be like go get these blood work
done,

13
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:39,901
see what your deficiencies are.
So we will get a prescription and I'll

14
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:41,560
never go do it.
I'm scared of needles.

15
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,480
It's a big thing.
You're scared of needles.

16
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:45,460
Get the fuck Outta here.
I pass out.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,390
I'm not joking.
I'm not scared to fight in a cage many

18
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:56,530
times doing ivs or stuff like that.
Yeah man,

19
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,640
I hate it.
I sold like when you're rehydrating like

20
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:05,240
when they give you an ivy,
you pass out and faint and then I will

21
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:09,730
wake up and everyone's looking at almost
attacked for us and a couple of guys

22
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:12,760
because I woke up and didn't know where
it was and I was just like,

23
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,010
that's
sucks.

24
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,130
I used to date this girl who couldn't
even watch someone get a needle in a

25
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:22,270
movie.
She would black out.

26
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

27
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:27,520
If I think about it too hard then I'll
let get my stomach will like,

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,630
that's so weird.
Yeah.

29
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,290
But that's the only logical.
I don't understand what that is and it

30
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:36,260
only happened like it only started
happening like four or five years ago.

31
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,740
Reward like blood because you have to
get blood work done for the fights,

32
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,470
right.
Past your HIV and all that stuff.

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,330
And before I would just be like,
yeah,

34
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:46,790
and it's done.
Walk away now.

35
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,320
Then all of a sudden out of nowhere,
every time I see a needle coming my way,

36
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:56,321
I see my face will get white and for no
reason that's so strange.

37
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:58,970
So I have to like,
get on my phone like this,

38
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:02,780
I have to lay down like it's a whole
host of look away and look.

39
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,310
Oh yeah.
Distract myself.

40
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,870
Wow.
Even talking about right now,

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,910
like,
get like a.

42
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,730
that's so strange.
I mean it was,

43
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,460
it would make more sense.
It was something you always had.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,990
Yeah.
It's so weird.

45
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,100
Like my ex girlfriend,
her dad had it and she said that her dad

46
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:19,970
one time,
um,

47
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,280
her brother got like a severe sunburn
and the blisters all over him and the

48
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,490
Dad saw it and the dad fainted.
And what's crazy is that dad was a

49
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:29,800
fucking doctor.
He was,

50
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,340
he was,
he was a dentist.

51
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,040
So I'm like,
how the fuck is this guy like me?

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,770
Obviously you must deal with some fucked
up shit and gory things.

53
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,440
Stills in dentistry too weird.

54
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,700
He,
I guess he was okay with needles,

55
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,460
but he would see certain things like he
saw his son with blisters from

56
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,970
listers
because you know,

57
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,350
like from,
from the sun,

58
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:58,170
from sunburn.
And he apparently had a really bad

59
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:00,170
sunburn.
It's weird.

60
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,540
It's fucking weird,
right?

61
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,560
Yeah,
it's in her family.

62
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,350
I guess,
but it's weird that you acquired it.

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,930
That's virtually nowhere.
It was just like one,

64
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,280
it was,
I was doing blood work for uh,

65
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,660
a fight and I was at the hospital and
that was just like everyday and then I

66
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:17,130
passed out and ever since then it
happens.

67
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,190
So I have to be really careful.
Uh,

68
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,380
but this guy goes around and just
records people.

69
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,300
Regular people walks up to you,
records you and puts it online and

70
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,190
whatever.
He edits it together and puts it on

71
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:31,160
Youtube.
What else?

72
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:33,250
Kinda fucked up.
Fucked up.

73
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,840
That's very fucked up is he agreed.
I wouldn't know who.

74
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:39,730
We know who the guy is,
no idea.

75
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,520
So he doesn't put himself on ever fuck
that guy.

76
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,720
So he walks up to people and gets a
various responses.

77
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:49,510
Some people like he walks up to chew all
this stuff.

78
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:52,060
Got pulled off youtube,
but it's on La live leak now.

79
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,310
He walks up to two mormons,
the ones that go door to door and

80
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,290
they're super polite.
They're like,

81
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,340
whoa.
They're like,

82
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,390
oh,
you're recording us.

83
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:03,610
Whatever.
They have a nice conversation and they

84
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,350
walk off.
But then other people,

85
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:08,020
they're trying to knock them out,
but I think it's so.

86
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,080
It's so interesting how
the camera in and of itself almost has

87
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:17,710
this social view of of like like a
weapon in a way.

88
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:23,050
It's like you're pointing that thing at
me because you're attempting to take.

89
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,170
The person's not doing anything wrong by
pointing the thing.

90
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:26,411
No,
no,

91
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:27,940
no.
I mean the person that's getting

92
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:30,220
recorded,
you're not doing anything wrong.

93
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,010
Why does it make us feel so
uncomfortable?

94
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,550
You're opening up a door for a bunch of
other people to enter into your life.

95
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,870
If you take a guy,
I'll got back.

96
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,910
I took a camera on you.
I don't know you.

97
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:43,720
I find you take a camera and then I put
it on the youtube channel that has a

98
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,880
million subscribers like yours does.
Well,

99
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,130
no,
no,

100
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,860
no.
Let's say the person doesn't know that

101
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,300
when they're being recorded.
Okay.

102
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,280
That right?
Like if you're out in the street,

103
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,550
probably doesn't count for you because
somebody might know who you are and what

104
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,310
in that case,
but if you're a regular everyday person

105
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:01,000
and someone walks up to you with their
smartphone and they're just a few feet

106
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,420
away from you,
recording you that like that's what he's

107
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:05,110
doing.

108
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,180
He's not announcing that it's going to
be on youtube,

109
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,450
but people's reactions are intense.
Shouldn't be phone still is fun and kick

110
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:14,760
him in the Dick.
Fuck that.

111
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,200
But maybe he wins.
He wins that way.

112
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,330
He wins the housing when.
Because I stole his phone.

113
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,400
No,
because that's because that's a way

114
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:23,080
better clip.
If you don't get it,

115
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,920
if you don't get that phone,
oh,

116
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,300
I'll get his phone,
get his phone.

117
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,200
Well,
whatever you may,

118
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,280
you may be more gifted than others who
fail in his clips to get it from him.

119
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,340
Like a sprinter.
While he's,

120
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,550
he,
he starts to get he.

121
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,830
He moves away at the right time.
This guy's crazy.

122
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,900
He interrupts like,
uh,

123
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,070
he,
he.

124
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,670
There are cases where he walks behind
the cash register at Mcdonald's and

125
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:49,720
starts recording people that are making
burgers and they're just like,

126
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:52,090
what the fuck?
Or in certain cases,

127
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:53,820
like he don't,
he walks,

128
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,780
he walks into like a,
um,

129
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,920
a card game that's going on private card
game and he's recording it like he takes

130
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:02,810
risks to,
to get that footage.

131
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:05,600
But I agree with you.
Fuck that guy.

132
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,950
But at the same time,
I think it sort of unveils something

133
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:13,850
about humanity and how we're not
completely ready for a fully recorded

134
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:14,210
future.
