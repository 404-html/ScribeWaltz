1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,310
Uh, hey fucking freaks. What's happening?

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,900
I should probably tweet.
I fucked up.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,130
I forgot to tweet this so I'll tweet while
I'm doing it. I like how you did that.

4
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:14,670
I like how your man,
we got to get better shit at my podcast.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,130
What do you mean what
you guys get the screens?

6
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:20,460
Anything that you're talking about?
Jamie's really quick, man. He's on it.

7
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:21,870
Like anything that you're talking about.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,710
He's already got some visuals
and some cutaways. That's huge.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,930
See that quick?
God Damn,

10
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:32,610
that's an ambulance and serious
production value right there to have.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,630
If you want to talk some shit, I don't
have that. That's what socks. I do not.

12
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:40,290
I we can hook you up. Yeah, yeah. You know
what? I need to step it up. We'll make it,

13
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:44,760
we'll talk after the show. I need
to stop. Good cameras and shit.

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,510
You went from the you,

15
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,880
you guys like right now
we're at the web cam cameras.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,210
You know there are 90 90 bucks
each I cam or something like that.

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,720
That's what all the low budget podcasts.
When I look at it,

18
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:03,450
you got now shit, they're just cameras
man. But those are like 400 $500 each.

19
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,430
They'd probably something like that. Yeah.
Look at you. They're not cheap. Yeah,

20
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,020
the setup. It looks cool.
And now wait a minute,

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,440
are you, this is what my suggestion
are we on? Yeah. Oh my [inaudible].

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,660
I think it'd be cool. You
got, you should start.

23
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:25,830
I'm not just getting one shot of Joe.
Have like four camera shot.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,890
This is not something that talking
about this. Would it be cool?

25
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,170
I need more in my face, bro. [inaudible]

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,070
angle me people tired of looking at
that angle. We're gonna mix it up.

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,120
I want to make a bloody all right. I did
a podcast recently and I had a makeup,

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,080
I'm not joking, there's their cameras.
They had a makeup person. I said,

29
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:46,140
I don't even wear makeup for work for TV.
I don't work makeup.

30
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,260
You can't put makeup on me. Like we're
just gonna put some anti shine. I'm like,

31
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,950
get the fuck out here. Are you crazy for
a podcast? If you're out of your mind.

32
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,640
But that meant, you know,
that's production value.

33
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:56,190
It's what they do while they're
doing a television show.

34
00:01:56,191 --> 00:02:00,360
It's not a fucking plate of
carrots and celery shit. Add that.

35
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:03,870
Then I slowly is tapping into that
television, the television status.

36
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,400
Well I think that's what
they're trying to do.

37
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:09,540
This podcast or granola
bars at the cheap ones, man,

38
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,650
nature's made Granola,
apple and oats. Like

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,190
we have this new a sponsor. We, we
have these things around all the time.

40
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,200
Naturebox is, is uh, our new
sponsor. That's um, they,

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,190
they send you healthy snacks
through the mail. Um, naturebox, I,

42
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,550
there was a bunch of people that
were complaining on my website.

43
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:31,740
There were throwed shoes.
It's pretzels.

44
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,340
The deal with naturebox is
you can go from, you know,

45
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:39,300
better for you then your standard
vending food. Like, you know,

46
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:41,520
you're dealing with if you're,
you know, standard vending food,

47
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,390
what you don't have to deal with with
nature boxes. No high fructose corn syrup.

48
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,050
Partially hydrogenated oils, no
trans fats, no artificial sweeteners,

49
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,980
no artificial flavors, no artificial
colors. Like just that alone.

50
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,970
Just that statement alone to me,
that that gives me ease.

51
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,040
I feel better about
whatever fucking snack I'm

52
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,630
eating. And they also, if you have like
any dietary needs, like gluten free,

53
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:07,390
like I tried to eat gluten
free as much as possible,

54
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:12,070
so they send me a bunch of
gluten free shit. They can
do low sugar shit. Not Shit.

55
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm saying shit, it's really good shit.
It's good stuff. Big Island, pineapples,

56
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,470
delicious. And there's this blueberry
almonds they have. Oh my God,

57
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:25,030
they're so good. And um, you can
get like, like stuff like that.

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,710
Very healthy. Not Bad for you at
all. It's when you get, you know,

59
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,660
into the Pretzel area. What
are you dealing with, man?
You're dealing with doe.

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,400
Doe's never really healthy,
but, uh, it's Yummy as fuck.

61
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,060
And they have an awesome selection
over a hundred snacks to choose from.

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,380
And like I said, if you have certain
dietary needs, uh, they can hook it up.

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,390
We enjoy it. We eat it here in the podcast

66
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,040
podcast listeners get fucking upset
by shit. Pretzels are not fucking,

67
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,750
that's not healthy. I like
it. I like it. I do. I mean,

68
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,040
it's a little picky, but I get it. It's
good. It's good to be picky like that.

69
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,280
Healthy snacks.
There's nothing wrong with that.

70
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,760
They also have this a pistachio thing.
I forget what it's called.

71
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,850
Like a pistachio cluster.

also brought to you by Squarespace.

76
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,880
Squarespace is one of my
favorite experiences on,

77
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,710
on the web as far as like,

78
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,540
if you want to create something and use
a website, then make something easier.

79
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,840
There's a lot of different websites
to give you a nice, nice, uh,

80
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,650
self help services.
And there's,

81
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,320
there's all sorts of different websites
that can help you with all sorts of

82
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,900
things.
But for the longest time,

83
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,550
making a website was fucking hard at shit.
I used to have.

84
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,650
My friend Andrew made
a lot of my websites.

85
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:09,640
He's just a really clever guy who knew
a lot about html and knew how to code

86
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,590
flash and he's make a bad ass website.

87
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,610
But I could never do what he did
on it on my own. But now you can,

88
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,470
you literally can anyone,

89
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,130
you could go on Squarespace and make
the dopest website. Actually Eddie,

90
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:24,220
you should probably do something like
this because you would be really good at

91
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:27,310
that. You'd be really good at
designing your creative guy.

92
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,080
You'd be really good at
designing your own shit.

93
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,950
And Squarespace makes it super easy.
It's just drag and drop.

94
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,690
You can make websites that seem like
massively professional and you can do it

95
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:41,220
all yourself. We had a Squarespace
contest where we let listeners, um,

96
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,650
create their own websites and it was
really not even fair because we only,

97
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:47,920
we only had to pick like quick four or
something like that. It was ridiculous.

98
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:51,280
There was so many good ones.
It's incredible what you can do now.

99
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,570
So you can make a website
easy and it's so easy, easy.

100
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,310
And on top of that you can make a easy,

101
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,870
you can set up an online store like got
Brian has done them while the show has

102
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:03,704
been going on.

103
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,280
He set up a website and a store in the
time that it takes to do the commercial,

104
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,150
like he'll just start selling
goofy shit like fake goofy shit.

105
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:15,560
That's when he sets it up. It's insane.
It's insane. It's literally insane. Huh?

106
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,870
It's better than anything I've
ever seen before. It was car.

107
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,290
As far as like constructing a website.
Well the guys who do it,

108
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,020
they're cool as fuck too. I met them in
New York. So you don't need like a to,

109
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,500
it doesn't need to be super
complex know you don't have to do,

110
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,600
you don't have to like
go to a website company.

111
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:32,660
I mean I have a website company that
designed mine and they're great and I love

112
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:35,660
them and they make my tee shirts
and shit to uprise and creative.

113
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,190
They're really cool guys and girls,
gals, women. They're very cool people.

114
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,420
So I like, I like giving them money.
They're bad ass. You know, I'm, I'm happy.

115
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,270
But if I was going to start my own website
right now, if I didn't have a website,

116
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,620
absolutely I would use Squarespace a
hundred percent. Does it have a forum to,

117
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,000
that's a good question. Date of
24, seven support. Um, they uh,

118
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,200
live chat and email. Um, and uh,
they also have a logo creator,

119
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:05,060
which is pretty dope. You can create
a clean, simple logo in minutes.

120
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,190
Um, it's uh, which is really
interesting. You know,

121
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:11,660
you're talking about starting up a company
like on it and then we have a logo.

122
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,370
Caveman coffee has a logo,
you know, logos, if you can,

123
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,690
if you could put together a
logo, it's like, you know,

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,840
your shit looks more professional than
just text. That's the secret land is,

125
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,870
is to get that logo ingrained in
everyone's brain once they trying to you.

126
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,260
That's why he can't change up your logo.

127
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:33,080
You got to pick a lug who stick with
it because if you keep changing it,

128
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,680
that fucks up the,
that brainwash process.

129
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,600
Didn't Hicks and Gracie catch some heat
from Nike that Nike wanted that Swish

130
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,510
out of his, uh, his awesome triangle
here. And something about that.

131
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,620
I wish I'd asked him. I saw him this
weekend. That dude's still looks great.

132
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,190
He's in his 50s, like
healthiest. Fuck. It looks great.

133
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,190
Excellent motherfucking Gracie.

136
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,480
Another thing I like about Squarespace,
they let you sign up. Do everything,

137
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:08,870
create a website and then enter
in your credit card information.

138
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,960
That's how confident they are of it.
They let you try it first, but try it.

139
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,550
You're going to love it. He tried it and
go, Holy Shit. That's a website. Boom,

140
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,400
and you're going to want to give them
your money. Trust me, it's a good deal.

141
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,630
Anyway,
squarespace.com and enter into code,

142
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:27,320
Joe Squarespace.
A better web starts with your website.

143
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,560
I don't know why they have that in there.
That seems ridiculous.

144
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,360
Better web starts with your website.
How about just make cool shit here?

145
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,780
That's probably better. Right? All right.

146
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,780
That's how those Alpha brains
are starting to take over.

147
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:43,970
So that was like 30 seconds of

148
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,250
reorganizing my neurons. Does
that make sense? Can you say that?

149
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,900
I don't know if that's an actual event.
Uh, we're also brought to you by on it,

150
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,770
not com. O. N. N. I.

151
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,150
T we got a lot of big things that I'm
talking to as you bra about uh, on it, uh,

152
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,020
that I'll be discussing in the future.
We've got some, we got some big moves.

153
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,440
Well we're trying to do with [inaudible]
is we're trying to put together a

154
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,240
company that what we call,
um,

155
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,970
the design is a human optimization website
and what we mean by that is we want

156
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,420
to provide you access to
everything that we find.

157
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:21,990
It's beneficial whether it's anything
that's beneficial for cognitive thinking,

158
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:25,140
like Alpha brain. If it's for
your mood, which like new mood,

159
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,190
which is a five HTP and l trip defense
supplement that actually helps your brain

160
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:30,300
produce more serotonin.

161
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,980
Whether it's things like kettle
bells or battle ropes or hemp powder,

162
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,410
hemp protein powder, the best ham pro
protein powder we can find in hemp force.

163
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,350
We just try to find the very best shit
available. That's our motto. Motto is,

164
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:46,770
what would we want to buy when
it comes to human optimization?

165
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:47,970
What kind of shit would we want to buy?

166
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,650
And so we even hired artists to make
dope exercise equipment like these primal

167
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:56,150
bells. This uh, cool. Um, this guy,

168
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,460
Steven's Shubin Jr is a really
cool artist and his, his,

169
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,160
a work that he did on, um,
the Zombie bells and the, uh,

170
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,830
the primate bells would
pull those images up. Jamie,

171
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,460
the primal bells are all the great
apes and the Zombie bells are all like,

172
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,000
you know,

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,040
if you want to freak yourself out
that you were getting in shape for the

174
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:17,850
apocalypse,

175
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,140
what better way to do it then the sling
around at giant Iron Zombie head or at

176
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,590
shine fucking gorilla head. They're
awesome. I love these things.

177
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,650
They make working out fun and I know
people that have in their house,

178
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:31,470
they don't even use them as a exercise
equipment. They just think they're cool.

179
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:35,580
They leave them as door stoppers and
shit. Anyway, go to [inaudible] Dot Com o.

180
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,620
N n I t use the Codeword Rogan and
save 10% off any and all supplements.

181
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,250
This Thursday night I am in Miami Bitch.

182
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm going to be at the Fillmore,
uh,

183
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:52,740
the Jackie Gleason theater at the
film war and I'm with the Great Tony

184
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,310
Hinchcliffe. So I'm looking
forward to that Thursday
Miami people. It should be a,

185
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:58,560
um, uh, it's part of the South Beach,

186
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,790
South Beach Comedy Festivals and um,

187
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,010
uh, thanks everybody that came out
this weekend as well to, um, uh,

188
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:10,740
to the comedy magic club and I'm going
to definitely start doing more of those.

189
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:12,300
I'll be doing those on
a regular basis now.

190
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,550
Now that Jay Leno was not
doing the tonight show anymore,

191
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,420
they used to be his spot,
the Sunday spot,

192
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:18,210
so they're giving them to a
bunch of different comics.

193
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:21,350
So I love that place and I'll be there
on a regular basis as well as the ice

194
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:26,280
house boom. [inaudible] boom. And
without that, no further ado, boom,

195
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,810
hit the music.
Young Jamie,

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,710
the Joe Rogan experience,

197
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,520
try by day Joe Rogan podcast all day.

198
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,830
Ah,

199
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,280
right where to even begin with this one.
Um,

200
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,210
you think it'd be cool to watch the
fight and instead of thinking of all the,

201
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,310
talking about different pieces of it,
cause it,

202
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,070
there's so many different aspects to it.
We could you think it'd be cool for

203
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,150
the viewer of who watch it and I just
tell you what I'm saying to him. Sure.

204
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,980
But are we allowed to do that? Like
Metamora so they paying people to, uh,

205
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,560
do you have to pay to watch
her? How it is? It's on youtube.

206
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,910
Should we probably should ask though
before we do something? I love it, dude.

207
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:14,460
Are you kidding me? You're kidding
me. That's what's asked him on,

208
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,800
uh,
I hope I can actually call them.

209
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,420
I think it'd be cool to signal on this
place just kind of sketch, um, for the,

210
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,120
just to give people background and
what are we talking about here? Okay.

211
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,690
Eddie Bravo. Uh, one of my favorite
human beings ever walked the earth.

212
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,640
My brother who, uh, I've
known, uh, we became best
friends. Like almost instantly.

213
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,060
We started hanging out together in
the late nineties, late nineties,

214
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,490
like thousand somewhere else.

215
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,600
I knew you from John Jocks in like 97 you
were the guy who was on an actor who's

216
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,360
on a TV show. You were doing news radio,
but I'd never seen news radio, but oh,

217
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:53,770
that's that one actor dude.

218
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:56,800
And you were taking privates and you
didn't do that many group classes.

219
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:59,380
At first you thought you were
doing the dope shit for the group.

220
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:03,820
Classes are for the peasants. Privates
are, that's when you get the real shit.

221
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,220
That's what you were thinking. Well, I
thought it was going to learn quicker.

222
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,660
I wanted to talk bad about that dude.
You know,

223
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:13,540
he was a real good guy that was teaching
me. I really like him, but it wasn't,

224
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,380
it doesn't, you have to roll with a bunch
of other people. It's just the fact,

225
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:20,080
you know, whenever I hear someone
telling me I'm taking private lessons,

226
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:22,550
I'm going to do some Jujitsu,
take private lessons. Like, well,

227
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,610
you can definitely learn
more than the average person,

228
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,780
but if you want to really learn Jujitsu,
you got to get dirty.

229
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,600
You got to get in there. And
uh, I didn't figure that out.

230
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,090
I didn't figure it out until
I started rolling with you.

231
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:37,210
So I started hanging out with you.
It's called Haluk right now.

232
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,400
But uh, the guy was a good guy. He just a,

233
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,270
we've got a story for
you ladies and gentlemen,

234
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,940
this if there's a backstory of this,
but I think he's mad at me, man.

235
00:13:52,941 --> 00:13:56,300
I haven't heard from him. I doubt it.
Yeah, he's mad at me. Don't say that.

236
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,280
He put it out there. He
Jenksen I dunno. I'm saying

237
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,680
hello.

238
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,310
Halogens. Joe Rogan. Hey, before you say
anything, we're on the air right now.

239
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,290
We're live. I just, I wanted to, uh,

240
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,670
I wanted to know what your feelings
were out of respect when it comes to a

241
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:15,860
youtube,
the videos being up on youtube.

242
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,280
Are you trying to pull those
down because we were going to,

243
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,960
we're going to play one and talk about it,

244
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:25,070
but only with your permission
because I, I didn't know if you, uh,

245
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,780
if you were pulling those
down off the Internet.

246
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,363
Okay.

247
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,450
All right. Remember, we're on live, so
don't give out any information right now.

248
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,410
Don't get crazy. So we can play it
though. On the podcast and we can,

249
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,790
we can talk about it over it.

250
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,953
Beautiful.

251
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,843
Long process.

252
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,090
Yeah. Well that's, that's a great attitude
too. I mean, let them know like people,

253
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:20,480
this is a really awesome event you put
on and people should support an event

254
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:22,430
like that just with their own ethics,

255
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,380
regardless of whether
it's available for free.

256
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,610
That's my feeling is metamorris is an
awesome thing for Jujitsu and we should

257
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:29,444
all support it.

258
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,753
Beautiful.

259
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,670
That's a beautiful attitude. I agree
1000% that does not even a real number.

260
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:45,130
Right? You can only get to
a hundred hey listen man,

261
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:47,380
I just want to tell you whatever you need,
man.

262
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:50,830
If you want to have me promote
the next ones, I'm totally down.

263
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,120
That was an awesome event.

264
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:56,830
You had some really high class matchups
with really great Jujitsu talent.

265
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,310
It was a pleasure to watch, man. I
really, really enjoyed it. So I just,

266
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,340
I'm going to support you in any way with
this cause I just think it's an awesome

267
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:04,174
thing you're doing.

268
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,500
Let's do
it.

269
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,490
Let's do it, brother. Let's
do it. Let's do it. All right.
I'm alive. I'm going to go,

270
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:21,480
so we'll talk to you soon. All
right, take care my friend. Hey Man.

271
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,880
Hey Dude.
I Dunno,

272
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:28,030
I haven't heard from him so I thought
he's probably busy and you know,

273
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,100
it was his uncle's probably upset at you.
What happened?

274
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,910
This is what's going on
this for people don't know.

275
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:41,640
Eddie Bravo is a famous for um,

276
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,330
one very particular upset a
long time ago when in 2003,

277
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,960
we went down to Brazil and Eddie
was competing in the Abu Dhabi, uh,

278
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,370
world submission championships, which is
the biggest event in a Nogi grappling.

279
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:55,330
It's a huge,
huge event.

280
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,860
And this is the event that gave birth to
legends like Marcella Garcia. You know,

281
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:03,160
where people got to see him perform for
the first time. And I mean, it's so many,

282
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,280
so much high level matchups
recently chrome crazy who
he had in the podcast head

283
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:09,910
is a huge victory in Abu Dhabi.

284
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,290
Eddie went down there and Hoya Gracie's
maybe one of the most decorated Gracie's

285
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,000
ever when it comes to competition,

286
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,440
I think probably the most right up next
to Hodgett, right? Yeah. At the top two.

287
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:24,400
I mean, the boiler is, he's a legend
of a true multiple g championships,

288
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:27,430
world championships in multiple
Abu Dhabi Nogi Championships.

289
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:29,920
He won it three times in a row and
no one's ever scored a point on him.

290
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,130
The guys about as good as you
can get for that 45 deficient.

291
00:17:33,131 --> 00:17:35,380
His Dad is Helio Gracie.

292
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,390
His Dad was literally the founder of
presenting digit two along with Carlos

293
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,111
Gracie.
I mean,

294
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:46,111
what his dad did was nothing short of
like for when you put into perspective the

295
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,260
like the history of martial
arts and different people.

296
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:55,920
Like Bruce Lee obviously plays a huge
part in many making my martial arts

297
00:17:55,921 --> 00:18:00,030
exciting, uh, getting people into martial
arts. Chuck Norris also huge part.

298
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:00,960
John Claude van Damme,

299
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,080
a very big pie that gets people
into the schools in the first place.

300
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,640
But when you talk about a person who's
like maybe the single most important

301
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:12,750
person in all of martial arts,
it might be Helio Gracie.

302
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,990
I mean it might, he might be
the most important person ever.

303
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,030
A small man who uses leverage and
beautiful technique to submit.

304
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:22,350
People took on all commerce.

305
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,190
We 140 pounds and he's
fighting these giant dudes.

306
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,430
I mean it's an amazing family.

307
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,460
The whole family is just what
a crazy movie type family.

308
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,470
I mean you think about it like a family
that wouldn't even exist in the real

309
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:41,190
world. How about a family
where one bad motherfucker,

310
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,160
this one jujitsu genius.
Elio.

311
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:48,900
Gracie has a bunch of sons and they
all turn out to be bad motherfuckers.

312
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,070
I mean whatever.
What,

313
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,900
what other guy has had
like produced 20 killers,

314
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,910
30 killers and his own brood?

315
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,470
Well if you get into the story with
Carlos Gracie, his older brother,

316
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:05,560
he's the one who actually
learn Jujitsu and showed it to,

317
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,470
to Helia and they both thought and stuff.
But towards the end as they got older,

318
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Carlos fought less and managed Heleo most
cause Heleo became the beast and Haley

319
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:22,210
was the one who refined and and tweak
the system and made it what it is today

320
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,610
technically.
But without Carlos learning it,

321
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,160
Heleo would have never learned Jujitsu.
So it was really,

322
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,700
they were both very Heleo designed
it and polished it and tweaked it.

323
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,680
But Carlos is the one that showed
him the Ra techniques from uh,

324
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,440
what he learned from my Ada. I
think his name is. Yes. Yes. I mean,

325
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:44,220
and I don't even when we're saying this,
this is no disrespect, that's a movie.

326
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:48,360
How come they haven't made a fucking
been out blockbuster James Cameron movie

327
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:51,690
about the Gracies come on.
Who would play Hixon but you know what?

328
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,410
Jujitsu guys would be so disappointed
because in an hour and a half they'd have

329
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:59,450
to just gloss over shit and like the
real story is way more complicated. Yeah.

330
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Yeah it would, it would, can
you imagine an hour and a half?

331
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:07,560
You explained the whole Gracie story
with all the brothers and Carlson and

332
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:12,561
Helson and all their different stories
and health and high end and that's dude,

333
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,350
they would have to have like the high
end edge would be like 10 minutes of the

334
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,290
movie. That's it. They'd
have to high end wood.

335
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,980
You know there are folks who don't know.

336
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:22,530
High end was like the crazy
grace called him Gracie devil.

337
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,290
He was like one of the wildest
cause he fought in pride as well.

338
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,430
A lot of them fought in
pride of course hens. Oh,

339
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:30,360
Henzel fought in pride and
there's so many great people,

340
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,610
great martial artists that
came out of that family, um,

341
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,240
high and Hanzo and how for all brothers.
And they were like,

342
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,220
they were like the Tasmanian devils.

343
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,830
But Hensdale was probably the most,
a friendly,

344
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,460
I think,

345
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,180
high end and how for just ready to
throw down at any time with anybody.

346
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,590
They were the two pit bulls.

347
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,610
How hands on was a pit bull
to and according to the
Machados and their stories,

348
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,350
Hanzo was always the one laughing
and joking and everyone loved him,

349
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:01,510
but he was always in
the middle of a fight.

350
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:07,060
Someone would want to fight
them and they'd be a riot.
And you know, hands on has,

351
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,620
Hanzo is like a super happy go lucky guy.
But he has a,

352
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,500
he has a side to him that he could be,
he could turn it on.

353
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:17,650
And you remember when he live tweeted,
beaten up those muggers,

354
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,900
hence this up. What a bad motherfucker.
Henzel Gracie has any thanked the uh,

355
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:26,490
the mayor for a not allowing guns.
So don't

356
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,860
worry about my gone.
And he went out and these guys,

357
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:35,650
apparently they were following him and
they were thinking about mugging him.

358
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,720
And not only did he beat
these guys up like he,

359
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,980
he was live tweeting it
and chasing after them.

360
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,970
I and m for some reason he knew he was
being targeted and that like they were

361
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,470
targeting Henzel Gracie,

362
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,390
what a human would have to be in the
movie somehow they would have to squeeze

363
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:55,300
that. That would be like a loss
scenes. You know what I mean?

364
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:57,670
That didn't quite make the story
and they couldn't make it fit.

365
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,570
But that's a crazy,
that's a modern day Gracie story.

366
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,190
Cause you hear about all these old
Gracie Dojo storm stories and there's all

367
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:10,510
these legendary, legendary stories.
But he tweeted pictures of his hands.

368
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,400
This is modern day old school Gracie
stories. Right. And it's only a couple of,

369
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:19,420
what is it? A year ago, what
year was it? What year was it?

370
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,290
What did it say up there?

371
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,900
And the crazy thing is I was on
Twitter when it was happening.

372
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,420
I was watching it live
as it was happening.

373
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,360
I was actually on Twitter while he was,

374
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,940
he was tweeting and these guys
are following me, check this out,

375
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,140
and he was taking pictures.

376
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,110
I'm going to lure them and see like some
alley or to your corner fucking show.

377
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,140
These poor guys, he's just took pictures
of his hands. I'll bust it up and bloody,

378
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,490
he's probably has so, so many connections
and Nyp d. You know what I mean?

379
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:51,300
He knew that if he needed a beat up some
muggers that no one would ever go to

380
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,670
him. And he's stressed. He's so connected.
Well he's also talking about it.

381
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:59,470
We'd like such glee, you know, reminded
him of a, you know, growing up in Rio.

382
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,190
He really is like, I mean he's
in New York City, you know,

383
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:07,210
he's about as connected as you
can mother fucking get. Come on.

384
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,160
There's a lot of cops are trained Jujitsu.
We know connected to every,

385
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,710
every side, you know, they know
some serious mobsters and share it.

386
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,340
I would imagine.
Probably knows at least for sure.

387
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:24,020
Mobsters want to hang out with Hanzo.
You know what I mean?

388
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,840
Gangsters would love to hang out with
Enzo. That's a real life killer. I there,

389
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,970
he's aggressive guy to his
personality is so fucking great.

390
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,190
Like when you're around him, he's always
hugging people and super friendly.

391
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,610
Like she's got a great energy to
them and he's a bad motherfucker.

392
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,970
My favorite Gracie of all
time and, and I, I love,

393
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,770
there's a lot of Gracie's
man that I personally,

394
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:48,380
that I know person and there's a lot
that I don't even know. I'm like,

395
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:52,790
I'm never met. Like I've never sat
down and talked to Horry on. Um,

396
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,660
I'm never sat down, talked to
hodge her, you know what I mean?

397
00:23:56,661 --> 00:24:00,380
There's a lot of great Helson. I never
sat down and talked to house and, but the,

398
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,650
the Gracies that I did
have, did have dual, do,

399
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:07,910
have relationships with and did have time
to talk and get to know is my favorite

400
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:12,710
all time is rose Gracie. She, I love her
to death. That is one of the sweetest,

401
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,750
coolest chicks on the planet.
And she's real, you know,

402
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:21,380
you're either come from the Heleo side
of the Carlos side. She's the only one,

403
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:21,930
her and her sister.

404
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:26,000
The come from both because hoary
on her dad married his cousin,

405
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,760
Helio Gracie is our grandfather.
Carlos Gracie is a great grandfather.

406
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,890
Weird, right? So rose
Gracie is the most Gracie,

407
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,660
she's grace. He's doubled. She's
double Gracie. Her blood is,

408
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,680
it's like Damn Pyre, Gracie
blood. You know what I mean?

409
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,290
There's her and her sister.
So Gracie,

410
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,640
double Gracie and she's the
coolest one to me. To me,

411
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:57,080
out of all the ones I've met, I love
her. We worked together and with the,

412
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,900
she runs the Gracie nationals and the
Gracie world and we work together and,

413
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,170
and uh, man, she's, she's, she's
awesome. I can't awesome. I love Henner.

414
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,630
I know. Henner I know here.
They've always been cool to me.

415
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:10,610
I want to get those guys in
the podcast too. Obviously.

416
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:13,550
You just heard that I would do Haluk
I would love to do him on as well.

417
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,170
Henner in here on,

418
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:20,171
I've done a fucking amazing
job of promoting Jujitsu
and in a technical sense by

419
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:24,530
showing those Gracie breakdowns. Those
are great. Those are really fucking,

420
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,560
they're entertaining.
Henry's like really captivating.

421
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:31,270
He's got like a great energy to
him when he's a natural, you know,

422
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,240
natural speaker and natural instructor
from all those years of teaching Jujitsu

423
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:37,970
classes. But he's very, he's very
entertaining, like his cadence,

424
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:40,610
everything but very technical
and they're Jujitsu delivery.

425
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,910
Their passion comes through. It's very
obvious. They really like what they do.

426
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:45,680
And I find that infectious,
you know,

427
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,190
those guys are awesome here on is always
been cool to me and her always been

428
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:53,570
cool. And uh, a crone. Gracie,
I just got to very cool.

429
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:58,640
Now I've met him and we've talked, he's
so cool. He went to my after party.

430
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:02,950
That's how cool. He went to my after
party. That's awesome. Yeah, that's,

431
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,560
that's pretty crazy. Right?
And I told him, I go,

432
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,500
aren't you going to get killed for this?
You do here.

433
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,780
This is like a pure
10th planet after party.

434
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,880
Everybody here is 10th plan and he's
just so cool. That's so damn cool man.

435
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,870
I love that guy. Well they, you know,
there's always these inter family feuds.

436
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,790
Yeah. There's a lot of weird shit
that goes on. Um, point being,

437
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,690
here's the story.
Eddie goes down there under dog.

438
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,580
Gracie is a legend. We're talking about
a legend from the most legendary family.

439
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:35,980
That's one thing you say unequivocably.

440
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,380
What is the most legendary family of
martial arts? The Gracies for sure.

441
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,210
100% there's not even a close second.

442
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:46,330
Probably the most legendary family that's
ever existed like what other family

443
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:50,160
has known for something like that.
Again,

444
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:55,310
like a big huge fan of world champions
known to be experts at strangling human

445
00:26:56,791 --> 00:27:01,410
beings. Not just experts, but think of
the amount of champions, hoists Gracie,

446
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:06,411
the very first UFC champion who
arguably change the world's opinion.

447
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,310
Instantaneousness of martial
arts. That one guy, super legend,

448
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,810
hoists Gracie. Then you've got
Henzel Gracie, another champion.

449
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,570
You've got Heuler Gracie
the most decorated. Him and
Haji are the most decorated.

450
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,210
Hickson who beats all of them? Yeah. Hixon
who's the best or you ask any of them.

451
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,090
They say Hickson's the best. How
crazy is that? That's insane.

452
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,020
That's what Matt [inaudible]
Hixson Lips, Hicks, Euler.

453
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,520
He webs everybody, you know, but all,
even though they get whipped by Hixon,

454
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,740
they're still legends. They're still
better than most of the people walk.

455
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,370
And so it's so crazy.

456
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:46,371
The different levels that is the most
legendary for real family of all time.

457
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
Yeah. I really think about that. They're,

458
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:55,010
the family business is breaking bones and
putting people to their death with our

459
00:27:57,271 --> 00:28:01,200
bare hands. That's the family
business. It's pretty crazy. Who's,

460
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,880
who's more hardcore than the Gracies.
There's uh, there's uh, some video.

461
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,090
Uh, it was like a
demonstration that Hixon did.

462
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,980
We're Hickson and Heuler had like a
little sparring demonstration, you know,

463
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:16,590
I don't know what it was though.
I Dunno. It was orchestrated.

464
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:20,670
It was like at one of those, um,
Japanese events. It'd be pride. Yeah.

465
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:22,200
They were just messing around.
Yeah.

466
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,060
They just sort of demonstrated
some techniques, you know,

467
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,780
but the only video that
I've seen of them rolling,

468
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:31,750
it's like there's some Gnocchi video of
them rolling, you know, but the, the, all,

469
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,880
any video that involves Hickson and his
brothers ultimately leads to the brother

470
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,960
tapping, which is insane. Everyone
gets smashed by Hicks. That's insane.

471
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:44,610
When you think about that, this one guy
and a family, a fucking super champions,

472
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,840
as one guy rises to the top over all
of them universally acknowledged.

473
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,330
And even the Brazilians
that did you get to that,

474
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,240
there's a lot of rivalries between the
Gracies and then it gets really technical

475
00:28:57,241 --> 00:29:00,570
and there's certain Gracie's don't like
other Gracie's and theirs and that's

476
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:05,010
normal. And all families,
it's just normal. So the fact
that it's a Jujitsu family,

477
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,190
that doesn't mean they're immune
to what all families go through.

478
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:09,420
All families have division.

479
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:12,990
This aunt is not talking to that and
my mom is not talking to her sister.

480
00:29:12,991 --> 00:29:15,910
They hate each other. Three are
like, like everyone says, it's,

481
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,900
that's just the way families are,
so they're not admitting to it.

482
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,120
So it's totally normal.
But uh,

483
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,350
when you get into what's really going on,
man,

484
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,110
uh,
it's just,

485
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,520
it's insane is what it is.
It's like the,

486
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,580
this one family that has created such
an empire of martial arts and in my

487
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:42,010
opinion, changed martial arts forever.
I think hoists Gracie and victory in the

488
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,580
ultimate fighting championship was one
of the most important moments in the

489
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:48,610
history of martial arts.
Without a doubt,

490
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,420
if not the most important because
people got to see what really works.

491
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,810
People got to see something in
a way that you never saw before.

492
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:59,530
He never saw a small man who
didn't look physically imposing,

493
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,450
dismantle other people with techniques.

494
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,270
Yeah,
and the whole,

495
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,590
even the hoary on was the guy that
actually made it happen physically.

496
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,960
The whole family was involved because
Horry on is the one who, it was his idea.

497
00:30:11,961 --> 00:30:14,270
We need to put this show on
in the states and prove the,

498
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,560
that Jujitsu is the most effective
martial art puppet by. We could do this,

499
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:23,561
but it was because of what he saw Hixon
doing because of what he saw heuler

500
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:28,460
doing in the, in the Dojo storm
matches and Gracie in action tapes.

501
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,690
It was because what his father
Heleo spread to everyone.

502
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,900
That's what made horian wouldn't have
the drive and the vision if he didn't see

503
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,670
what Hickson was doing on a daily basis.

504
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:43,370
And when his dad did and know
the history of what his dad did,

505
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,220
all that everybody, Carlson, Gracie,

506
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:50,030
he was using all the cars and Gracie
fighters and the Gracie and action tapes.

507
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,000
It was all that, all the Gracie, uh,

508
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:00,580
events and all the Gracie people that
were all involved and hoary on needed all

509
00:31:00,951 --> 00:31:02,450
that to explode the UFC.

510
00:31:02,451 --> 00:31:05,840
So it wasn't just horror
on it was everybody Horian
couldn't have done it alone.

511
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,910
So, uh, that's why there was
some, there was some division,

512
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,690
some guys wanted to go here and say,
you know,

513
00:31:11,691 --> 00:31:14,930
I'm going to do this on this side and
then you know, the people. But that's,

514
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,910
that's totally normal. But, um,

515
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,990
also there was some things
opening up in other countries too,

516
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:24,000
like kicks in and started doing Japan.
Valley two was around the same time.

517
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:26,390
It wasn't only one 94
and it just exploded.

518
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,310
Yeah. When, when Hawaii blew it all up,

519
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,120
all the people that were involved down
the chain, Carlson and all those guys.

520
00:31:32,121 --> 00:31:35,240
And everyone, they said, okay,
this is, we're all part of this.

521
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,810
So that then it just grew
and exploded in the Gracie.

522
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:42,950
It just instantly Jujitsu just
spread all over the world. Instantly.

523
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,970
Everybody needed Hugh Jitsu,
martial arts masters were traveling,

524
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:51,170
all of their all going into Jujitsu.
All these American guys going into Rio,

525
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,220
you know, just became like,
uh, uh, uh, the thing to do,

526
00:31:55,221 --> 00:31:58,470
man in martial arts is
go to Brazil and then we,

527
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,770
we got exposed to chew Scotty as and
[inaudible] and all that shit's here

528
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:04,604
because,

529
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,540
yep. And that's one of
the things about, um,

530
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:12,400
about martial arts at a lot of people
don't realize is that for maybe thousands

531
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,000
of years, it pretty much remained
the same when the Gracies came along.

532
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,020
That was what really kickstarted it
to this level. Right now, you know,

533
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:22,420
you can say that Jujitsu is not
their most important martial art,

534
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,440
but historically it's the most
important martial art. Unquestionably.

535
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,940
Like that one event.

536
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:32,410
People where people got to see a guy
like hoists dominate these bigger,

537
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:35,740
stronger guys and he wasn't a scary
looking physical. It didn't like,

538
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,290
it wasn't built like Mike
Tyson or anything like that
and it wasn't built like

539
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,570
Roy Jones. When you look at them
and go, Whoa, how can that guy move?

540
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:46,550
That guy moves like a coast. It wasn't
that, it was just technique, you know? So,

541
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,760
uh, pretty, pretty amazing thing to watch.

542
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,640
It's one of the things people don't
realize too about Chuck Norris.

543
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,790
Chuck Norris was ahead of the
fucking curve, man. Chuck Norris,

544
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,550
even though like a lot of people
associated with like Walker,

545
00:32:58,551 --> 00:33:01,790
Texas ranger and you know,
like movies and TV shows.

546
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:06,791
Now Chuck Norris was a legit kickboxer
like legit champion kickboxer legit

547
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:12,110
karate champion. He was a
bad mother fucker. And he
really was into martial arts,

548
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:14,570
into training in martial
arts and learning new things.

549
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,450
And when did he start
training with the Machados

550
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,300
way before the UFC? Way
before the UFC, right? Like,

551
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,100
didn't you have like an eighties?

552
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,160
He had like a purple belt or a brown
belt before the UFC for the first year.

553
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:28,760
I've said

554
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,260
he was responsible somehow for,
uh,

555
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:37,100
the UFC getting moved along and there
were, there was some kind of connections,

556
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:39,680
you know, cause once it, Chuck
Norris discovered Jujitsu,

557
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:44,710
he was all over and he just immediately
injected it into his Chuck Norris

558
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,650
System. Anybody that's in the
Chuck Norris Affiliation System,

559
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,120
they have to do Jujitsu.

560
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:54,800
That's a karate association that
requires you to do Brazilian Jujitsu.

561
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,910
Chuck Norris is the map.

562
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:00,010
Yeah. He, um, I met him twice. I met
him once when I was at you with you.

563
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,870
We met him at some kickboxing event.

564
00:34:01,871 --> 00:34:05,270
Remember when went to see
that world combat league.
Thanks Brad. Thought an hour.

565
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:09,040
Yeah, dude, there was, that
was a lot. Raymond Daniels
too, I think was on that card.

566
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,800
Um, a lot of great fighters.
I was fun as hell and,

567
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,580
but just meeting Chuck Norris was
like holy, but I didn't get a picture.

568
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,730
This met him again recently. I got
a picture of them. That guy, the,

569
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:24,340
he's a real deal, man. You know what
he did? And he's such a humble guy too.

570
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:29,000
Like all these guys I was on this,
uh, diocese does deus too. Um,

571
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,380
it's got Jim Harrison,
it's famous karate champion as well.

572
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:37,090
They were a congratulating
him and Chuck Norris was like,

573
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:37,750
he,

574
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:42,750
all of his stories like involve
like bad things happening to him.

575
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:48,280
All of his stories involved.
Like, uh, he, uh, he, he panicked.

576
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:52,210
He couldn't talk in front of people.
So he told this hilarious story about,

577
00:34:52,211 --> 00:34:55,110
I'm not even remembering set,
talking, not even remembering,

578
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,430
giving a speech because he was so
terrified to speak in front of people.

579
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:01,510
Like very self deprecating, you know,
it was where a lot of fellows, you know,

580
00:35:01,511 --> 00:35:04,270
you're getting to that sort of an
event and the guy looks for it as an

581
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:07,840
opportunity to go in the glory days and
talk about his past victories and that

582
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:11,290
kind of shit. Chuck Norris said none
of that. He was laughing and smiling,

583
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,150
you know, just self deprecating.
That guy's a legit martial artists.

584
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,040
Like a real legit martial artist.

585
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,760
Yeah. And, and of course, you
know, with that kind of mentality,

586
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:27,240
as soon as you discovered that
there's a big weakness in your game,

587
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:31,020
you want to fill that shit and, and fill
it immediate immediately. So he got it.

588
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:34,740
He was integrated you jet to then he
started training with the Machados and got

589
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:39,720
really tight with them and
ended up getting his black
belt from Carlos I think.

590
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,980
And that's why Carlos
went to Texas and yeah.

591
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,350
And that's who I got my black belt from.
John Jacques Machado,

592
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,620
one of the Great Machado brothers.
There's five of them, Hagan,

593
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:53,460
Johnny [inaudible] and
John Jock and Carlos.

594
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,590
And uh,
John Jog is another,

595
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,730
I mean the Machado family is another
legendary family as well. I mean,

596
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:02,220
you think he again hodge or John Jock,
I mean that,

597
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,660
that family as well became legendary
for very, very high level black belts.

598
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,040
The we're cousins. Yeah. I mean,
and there's a photo of them.

599
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,540
Look in John. Jack has just a
beautiful human being. I love that car.

600
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,160
No Spartan,
he's just got such a great energy to,

601
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,030
that's a great picture,
right there is,

602
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,010
that's like 1993 five boys,

603
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:31,200
five boys from Brazil,
all bad asses at Jujitsu.

604
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,120
All five of them. That's pretty
crazy. It was crazy, you know,

605
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:36,690
because when Jujitsu exploded,
all the Gracies said,

606
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:37,770
I'm going to make my own shit.

607
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,800
And they all just made their own schools
and hence I went to New York and,

608
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,023
and uh,

609
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,790
you know how of course the San Francisco
and they take their markets and shit

610
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,810
and that Horry on did the Torrance thing.

611
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,700
That was like the main Gracie place and
then all the Gracie started spreading

612
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,890
and some stayed in Brazil. The
machados man, five boys, five brothers,

613
00:36:58,891 --> 00:37:02,250
they all came out and they just opened
up a school together and Redondo beach

614
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,640
and then the second one in the valley and
Tarzana, that's where I ended up going.

615
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:09,640
But man there, it's
pretty crazy man. Yeah,

616
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,730
that five boys and they're all around the
same age. Can you imagine? Pop, pop, pop,

617
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:17,500
pop.
You have five boys and they all look,

618
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,310
they all look very similar
and they're all yoked.

619
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:25,290
They're killers and they're every one of
them. Every one of them is a bad asset.

620
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,670
Jujitsu, that's pretty remarkable,
but the Gracies got, that's,

621
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,910
that's just another day in the park
for the Gracies like every family.

622
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,050
If you're a Gracie man and you've got
a Gracie last name and you're not doing

623
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:42,000
Jujitsu, what happened? I want
to document. I don't know.

624
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:42,811
That's a good question,

625
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:45,840
but that would be a really hilarious
comedy sketch like a Tim and Eric Sketch.

626
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,370
The one grace you didn't want
to do Jiu Jitsu is one grace.

627
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:53,610
He's just into like dance or
something like that happens.

628
00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:55,180
Sometimes I bet that you know what?
I don't,

629
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,410
everyone in the family does
Jujitsu and then I want to do this,

630
00:37:58,411 --> 00:38:00,390
I want to be an artist or I want to be,

631
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,460
and then you try that for a
while and you're like, shit,

632
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,300
I can make some easy money just using
my name and Jensen and then you realize,

633
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:09,060
fuck it. You realize what you have.
You know, like you have a great thing.

634
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,850
Your whole family are experts.

635
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:16,080
It's choking people and taking their arms
and you're choosing this other sheet.

636
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:18,870
You have this life for you right here.

637
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,450
So you just want to be their
own individual though, you know?

638
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:25,650
But that is a good question.
What percentage of Gracie men didn't do g?

639
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,250
Zero. Zero. Wow. That would be remarkable.

640
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,120
I think they raised him with it from
the time they were children. Yeah.

641
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,040
Gracie is your last time. You have no
choice. You're going to do Jujitsu. That's

642
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,060
incredible. Right? It's pretty
incredible. So 2003 and we're in Brazil.

643
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,890
Giant match.
Um,

644
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,600
Eddie Beats Gustavo's [inaudible] who
was a very high level Jujitsu black belt

645
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,880
and uh, he taps him. He gets
his back. So I saw that you're
pumped up. You know, you,

646
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:56,680
you felt very confident, you felt good
and you were, you know, you were zoned in,

647
00:38:56,681 --> 00:39:01,330
but the idea that you were going to
fight oiler Gracie seems so crazy to me.

648
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,760
It just deep knowing what
I know about the Gracies,

649
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:05,950
knowing what I know about
the history of the family,

650
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:11,130
knowing what a legendary fan with there
to see you my best friend standing there

651
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,620
with a boiler, Gracie and you guys
are about to grapple. I'm like,

652
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:17,930
and we're in Brazil, Mike too. This
is a fucking trip. I was starstruck.

653
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:23,260
Thought it wasn't as I was watching
some three d TV or something.

654
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,720
It feels like you're right
there on the mat. And uh,

655
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,720
Eddie wound up catching him in a triangle
and it was the craziest fucking thing

656
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:34,990
I've ever seen in my life. And
uh, it was like time stopped.

657
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,970
It was like when you slapped that triangle
on him, it seemed like time stopped.

658
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:43,390
It didn't even seem real. And you
kept, you kept jailbreaking man,

659
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:45,760
which is why it was hilarious.

660
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:50,350
That dexterity that you have with your
legs and you're setting up this alma plot

661
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:54,820
to here
and you got them in like full,

662
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,950
full rubber guard here.
Yeah.

663
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:59,980
That Michigan's trolls at the beginning
of the rubber guard, right? Yeah. You,

664
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,350
what you had then was the
ability to control people.

665
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,260
You just didn't have as many
variations on technique to attack with,

666
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,010
but you had this unbelievable fucking
flexibility that a lot of people aren't

667
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:09,844
aware of.

668
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:14,800
You got some weird flexibility and not
just flexibility but dexterity like in

669
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:19,210
places that maybe some people
can grab their leg and put it,

670
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,500
you could put your leg there on its own.
But um,

671
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:27,190
there's so many guys that are out there
that W it's not that weird flexibility.

672
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,240
It's just getting into Lotus.

673
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,890
Like if you got into yoga and
you've got obsessed with it,

674
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,160
eventually two years,
three years, five years,

675
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:40,170
you'd have to be able to get into
the very basic low disposition. Yes.

676
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,540
There's a little more than that fell. Are
you being nice? Yeah. That's what it is.

677
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,020
I know what you're saying. But the
reality is you got some crazy legs,

678
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,720
something weird about your legs.
Your legs are like arms.

679
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,790
They move in strange ways, right? Hairs.

680
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,180
If he didn't try to pass right there
and if we had just stayed in my guard,

681
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,220
I wouldn't have gotten them this one.
And a half in this transition. Oh

682
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:05,770
yeah. He got uh, aggressive and he
shouldn't have got aggressive. He,

683
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,630
if he would've just been conservative,

684
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:12,040
I wouldn't have been able to go
right here, right into the triangle,

685
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:16,850
boom over hook. Oh, John Jack right there.

686
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:17,390
That's all Jay.

687
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:21,500
You control that wrist and then slapped
it over and now this right here where

688
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:25,970
you had the triangle locked in once here,
like right there, I was like, Holy Shit.

689
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,090
Because before it was like one of
those things where you're not breathing

690
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,930
because it's not totally locked in, but
once you had it locked behind the knee,

691
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,300
I was looking, I was like, how is this
guy going to survive? And he's tapping.

692
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,570
I was like,
he can't survive like no one can.

693
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,580
It's a human being when you have a guy
your size and you slap a triangle on him

694
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:49,600
this tight. See right here.
I wasn't sure Pam there.

695
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:53,450
I knew like when once he dropped out, I
was like, Holy Shit, that's locked in.

696
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,690
You were screaming, man. Oh my God.

697
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:59,750
And we were the only one screaming
because everybody else was freaking out.

698
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,140
There's Brazilian TV station.
It's set up cameras there.

699
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:06,950
They shut down the other matches so they
could better light this match because

700
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:10,070
Hoya grace, she's a hero and
they were going to show a boiler.

701
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:14,390
Gracie dominating the first time
Abu Dhabi came to Sao Paulo.

702
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:19,550
When you slap this triangle on them, dude,
all you heard was me and Jamie Walsh.

703
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,810
Me and Jamie Walter yelling out,
pull the head, pull the head.

704
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:29,090
Oh my God. Oh my God. It was
just madness. Like, Oh shit,

705
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:31,130
what?
W We couldn't even believe it.

706
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:35,590
And then once you did pull
the head and once he did tap,

707
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,930
it was like the world froze. It was weird.
It was like a, it didn't make sense.

708
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,660
The world just became some new place.

709
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:48,710
The world is a totally new element opened
up like the world became a new place.

710
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:53,340
Now all of a sudden Eddie Bravo was
a champion martial artist. Well,

711
00:42:53,341 --> 00:42:55,140
I didn't win the championship.
It doesn't matter.

712
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,180
You just have toilet Gracie like
you're capable of tapping oil grease.

713
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:02,100
That's championship level shit. He tapped
one of the greatest guys of all time.

714
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,980
It was,
it was a whole new world opened up.

715
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,880
It was just all of a sudden it was
like, Whoa, this is weird. Yeah, it was,

716
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,130
it was weird. It was weird to watch
too, man. Cause I'm, when I met you,

717
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:15,560
you're a purple belt, you
know, you were really good,

718
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:17,840
prayerful belt and we're
crazy moves and shit.

719
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,080
And then all of a sudden you brown belt
and you were a brown belt and Abu Dhabi

720
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:26,570
Bro. That's crazy. You tapped
them when you were a brown belt.

721
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:32,110
So 11 long years go by and this
Saturday night they had a rematch.

722
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,280
Um,

723
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,370
Eddie and boiler had a rematch
and metamorris and that's
what we were talking to

724
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:38,570
at Gracie about on the phone.

725
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,440
They're promoting these professional
Jiu Jitsu matches and uh, it's awesome.

726
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:47,690
Keenan Cornelius fought,
um, uh, Kevin Casey,

727
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,790
Kevin Casey took out. I'll just
describe the whole event. Um,

728
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,260
a lot of really,
really high level fighters.

729
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:57,860
Fought a lot of really good a
Jujitsu fighters fought and I'm,

730
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:02,500
the main event was Eddie
versus Heuler Gracie and uh,

731
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,340
11 years running.
I mean,

732
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:09,140
it's a long time in between
matches and there was so much talk,

733
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,980
so much, so many haters,
so many believers, so many.

734
00:44:12,981 --> 00:44:17,120
I mean there's so much back
and forth between, you know,

735
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:20,030
the people that thought that Eddie
winning the first time was a fluke.

736
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:25,270
And the people that legitimately thought
that Eddie has a brilliant mind and a

737
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:28,610
creative mind for Jujitsu
that's really unique.

738
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,820
And he can come up with a
lot of techniques and his
deck, like he's talking,

739
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,650
he doesn't want to admit that he's
got weird dexterity in his legs,

740
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:37,170
but he can move his legs in weird ways.

741
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,250
He can wrap you up and triangles and
stuff and weird ways without a lot of

742
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:44,240
people have to grab their foot
and place it in places. Um,

743
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:49,380
so he has these techniques that he's
developed and like really created a bunch

744
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:54,240
of paths like been and a lot of a Jujitsu
guys do this. This is not unique. Um,

745
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,630
but his past where uniquely his and
that he came up with a lot of different

746
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:04,140
techniques and approaches and refined
a lot of other approaches that,

747
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:08,460
so he sort of adopted or
adapted to Jujitsu. And um,

748
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:12,990
the system in 2003 was really,

749
00:45:12,991 --> 00:45:16,140
I'm not even a 10th of what it is now.
Um,

750
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,670
after 2003 Eddie started teaching
and then it became crazy.

751
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:25,671
Then the system started growing and new
techniques were added and that there

752
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:30,900
became guys like Denny proper goes who's
a a a world champion as a brown belt

753
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,090
guys came out of there that
we're showing that your,

754
00:45:35,091 --> 00:45:38,580
your techniques weren't just for
you and your crazy dexterity,

755
00:45:38,581 --> 00:45:42,890
but you had broken down things
in a way that you know, uh,

756
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,530
other people hadn't done before and a
weird way your, your, your positions,

757
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:49,850
your very unique.
And um,

758
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,380
there was a lot of people that do
want accept that for whatever reason.

759
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,560
And there was all this, oh, he
got lucky. Oh, Fluke, oh this.

760
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,580
So Saturday night rolls around and
I couldn't imagine there being more

761
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:01,680
anticipation in a room before something.

762
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,100
And it was a cool anticipation too
because one of the things I like about

763
00:46:05,101 --> 00:46:08,130
Jujitsu is no one's going
to get knocked the fuck out.

764
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,860
Even if you get choked out,
you know,

765
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:15,360
there's something about like seeing a
friend fight. It gets real rough. I mean,

766
00:46:15,361 --> 00:46:16,770
we've been friends with MMA fighters,

767
00:46:16,771 --> 00:46:19,830
but I've never been as friendly with an
MMA fighters. I am with you, you know,

768
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,450
I've,
but no one,

769
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:24,810
a guy and liking a guy and then watched
him get head kicked as hard to do,

770
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:28,560
you know, so it didn't have the
date that, that aspect to it,

771
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:33,480
but it was all positive is what I'm
trying to say. It was all just holy shit,

772
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:37,800
it's going down. Um, and once it did,

773
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,160
there was no points because
it's a 20 minute match.

774
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,490
So for 20 minutes it's either
submission or no points,

775
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,420
but in that 20 minutes you
swept him on multiple occasions.

776
00:46:48,421 --> 00:46:53,250
You've got side control. He never
threatened you in any way, shape or form.

777
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,380
You swept in with electric chairs.

778
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:59,460
You threatened him with a neck crank
and you threatened him with his nasty

779
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:02,790
fucking submission move on his
knee. Which I don't, you know,

780
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:06,570
I don't know how he didn't tap cause
that was hard to watch man when we were

781
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:09,840
sitting there watching. That was the
move. I got you on a high time. Yes.

782
00:47:09,841 --> 00:47:13,680
You know that movie vaporizer,
that move is so painful.

783
00:47:13,681 --> 00:47:17,520
Just that photo shoot, that
shit hurt man. It hurts.

784
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,710
And somehow or another a boiler just,
I mean, look, he's a warrior. He just,

785
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,910
he didn't want a tap. He just
decided he wasn't going to tap. Um,

786
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:32,000
for people who have never
seen Jujitsu before, um,

787
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:37,050
that was like the perfect introduction
match because it was so exciting.

788
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:42,490
There was so much madness and there was
a bunch of times where you were, uh,

789
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:46,240
you were working on shit and he rolled
you over onto your back and then he swept

790
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:49,630
them again. So there's all these
like saws when he would role,

791
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:51,070
you'd be on your back.
Oh, she, he's on his back.

792
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,700
But you on your back is different than
a lot of people on your back because

793
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:57,400
that's how he tapped him in the first
fight. You tapped him from your back.

794
00:47:57,401 --> 00:48:02,200
Your back is, you know your,
your guard is crafty. So it was,

795
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,280
it was an incredibly thrilling match
because there was constant threat at all

796
00:48:06,281 --> 00:48:10,330
times and even from him,
man, he's still Hoya. Gracie,

797
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,320
you always knew. I mean, he's still
that champion. If something went wrong,

798
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,740
if you didn't dot your
i's and cross your t's,

799
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,760
I was not sure I was going to win
this fight. How could you be sure?

800
00:48:20,761 --> 00:48:24,660
It's fucking crazy. I mean, he's oiler
fucking Gracie. He never said that.

801
00:48:24,661 --> 00:48:28,230
I'm going to go out there and just
strangle them. I was just, I didn't know.

802
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,880
I hadn't competed in so long.
Look right here,

803
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:31,170
I'm faking like I'm going to wrestle

804
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,270
because I didn't think he was just going
to let me pull them into quarter guard.

805
00:48:36,271 --> 00:48:39,690
I thought at this point my
wow. He just, he didn't,

806
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:42,390
I thought he was just going to
try some totally different ship.

807
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,780
But this is what he always does.
Every morning before I work out,

808
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,110
I warm up on the stair master,
I go to Youtube,

809
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:53,520
put Heuler ADCC pick one of his matches
and that's how I get that gives me all

810
00:48:53,521 --> 00:48:57,690
the motivation. I just watch him
roll and he's so good at this.

811
00:48:57,691 --> 00:48:59,910
But I thought he would try
to pass to the other side.

812
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,190
And I thought this position,

813
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:05,940
I thought this position was going to be
the hardest to get and this was the key.

814
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:10,290
If I could just get quarter guard in this
position, I felt like I could get them.

815
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,290
And there's a bunch of crazy
rules in this match as well.

816
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,610
One of the rules was that boiler was
wearing like these skin tight shorts.

817
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,010
Eddie was wearing khaki pants.
Um,

818
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,250
and Heuler was allowed
to grab addies ski pants,

819
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:26,970
but Eddie wasn't allowed to grab toilet
shorts. So it was weird to watch man.

820
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,730
Cause there's times where he's like
giving you a Wedgie and pulling on your

821
00:49:29,731 --> 00:49:30,400
pants.

822
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,140
Yeah, he's pulling them down.
I could see my underwear.

823
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:32,690
Yeah.

824
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:36,650
And when and when he got to that a leg
lock and he's trying to defend that leg

825
00:49:36,651 --> 00:49:41,000
lock and you're tearing his knee apart
and he's hanging onto your, your cough.

826
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,570
It's saved him. The pat saved him.
Yeah. Cause he didn't have the pants.

827
00:49:44,571 --> 00:49:47,270
I would have stomped on that foot
and got the extra power because he,

828
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,390
oh I mean a man,
his,

829
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:53,900
I think his knee popped at least
seven times. We were talking.

830
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,840
I'm like we could stop this now. You sure?
He goes, no, I'm fine. And I'm popping.

831
00:49:57,841 --> 00:50:00,440
I'm like what about that?
Because I'm fine. I'm like,

832
00:50:00,441 --> 00:50:03,560
it just kept popping on my damn.
Well you sure cause everything's good.

833
00:50:03,561 --> 00:50:06,920
I said everything's fine. Like we're
talking throughout this whole match.

834
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,320
Like right here. He wanted the
under hook really, really bad.

835
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,810
So I was saying it's hard
to get this time. Huh?

836
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:16,270
Cause the first time he got the under
under a lot of word that I'm a lot of work

837
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,450
cause that's a hard one.

838
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:23,080
It's only because I would rather go
against a guy who wasn't really mad at me.

839
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:27,650
If I could joke with you and get like a,
like this is just for fun. Right? Right.

840
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,170
Then I feel like, okay, I,

841
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:33,590
I can get this guy now because I could
win because he's not mad, but it was map.

842
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:34,521
Oh Shit.

843
00:50:34,521 --> 00:50:37,460
Like I would never want to find like a
Diego Sanchez type guy was mad at me.

844
00:50:37,461 --> 00:50:40,580
I'm like, oh no, no, no. I want to find
a guy that's like friendly and shit.

845
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,730
So it's hilarious.
Yeah.

846
00:50:44,731 --> 00:50:49,340
So I was just constantly joking
with them constantly. And uh,

847
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:52,200
during, like after I swept him, when
I get on top of the electric turn,

848
00:50:52,201 --> 00:50:54,800
I'm holding, I go, you can't move
from here. So just hang on and relax.

849
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,970
I need about a minute to rust. And I
go, you can't do nothing. Just relax.

850
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,050
Because there are some positions
where they're, I don't know,

851
00:51:06,051 --> 00:51:09,410
maybe three or four positions are like
cradles there, like rustling cradles.

852
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:12,920
And it happens here where the guy on
the bottom just can't do anything.

853
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,830
He's not getting tapped, but he can't
move. He's to completely wrapped up.

854
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:20,660
And I used those spots to rest. So, uh,
but it's hilarious that you told though,

855
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:24,980
just relax. When me and John, Jack Russel,

856
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:28,220
we are always talking smack to each other.

857
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:33,380
Me and John Jock always goof and we're,
oh, it's always a joke. It's always,

858
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,500
always me and Sean.
It's like a thing we do and I do.

859
00:51:36,501 --> 00:51:38,840
There's certain guys that I
rolled with that I do that too.

860
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:41,900
I don't like to do it too much to my
students because then it seems like, um,

861
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,890
acting all arrogant against a guy that I,
he's one of my students,

862
00:51:45,891 --> 00:51:50,280
he's a blue belt or a white belt that
would look really Douchey, playful.

863
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:53,990
But because John Jack can
smash me anytime he wants.

864
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,690
I talk like I pretend like I'm arrogant
cause it's funny because he could do

865
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:02,660
anything you want.
So no matter how Douchey I get,

866
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:06,830
we know it's just doesn't make any
sense cause he's killing me. But um,

867
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:11,540
uh, so same thing here. I have
so much respect for him that,

868
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,720
that I feel like I could just joke around
with them and I don't want him to be

869
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:16,010
mad at me.
Well that's good.

870
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,610
That's a good attitude to have man,

871
00:52:17,611 --> 00:52:21,640
especially after 11 years
between the matches. Um,

872
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:25,270
it's cool that you, uh, you kept that
feeling and you were completely destroyed,

873
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:30,060
completely respectful, rather,
uh, the entire way up to
the promotion of it. Your,

874
00:52:30,061 --> 00:52:31,590
your opinion of him, you know, you were,

875
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,420
you were like praising what a legend he
is and you were very self deprecating

876
00:52:36,421 --> 00:52:39,290
about your first victory to um,

877
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:43,350
this was a 20 minute match and because
there was no submission, uh, it's a draw.

878
00:52:43,351 --> 00:52:45,390
Metamorris is doing a
unique thing and they,

879
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,090
I don't know if they've got the rules
totally ironed out where they want them to

880
00:52:48,091 --> 00:52:49,160
yet,
but what the,

881
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,350
what they're trying to do is
discourage people from point fighting.

882
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,830
And what that means is work
towards submission at all times.

883
00:52:55,831 --> 00:52:59,920
And you may get a submission and you
may not get a submission, but the, the,

884
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,010
the idea is you're,

885
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,990
you're seeing real Jujitsu here
and they've accomplished that.

886
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,330
Like everyone was going for submissions,

887
00:53:06,331 --> 00:53:10,200
whether it was Guy Mendez or Hoffa
Mendez or you know, Kenan Cornelia is,

888
00:53:10,201 --> 00:53:14,100
everyone was going for submissions.
Um, sometimes they didn't get them,

889
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:18,290
but it was really exciting because of
that because guys couldn't just sort of

890
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:21,580
wrestle to a certain
position and then hold. Um,

891
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:25,980
but if this was a scored match,
you would beat them handily.

892
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,720
I mean you swept him multiple times,

893
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:30,830
you've got side control on them
and you had two near submission.

894
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:32,120
This is where he gets the under hook.

895
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:35,270
This is the crowd goes nuts because he
was been fighting for the under hood for

896
00:53:35,271 --> 00:53:37,220
five minutes and he finally gets it.

897
00:53:37,221 --> 00:53:39,620
And this is the position that
we're in and our first match.

898
00:53:39,621 --> 00:53:43,710
So all the grades it was like, yes, he got
the undercuts. So technical that right.

899
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,380
He finally got it.

900
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:50,120
And I still have them in quarter
guard here so I was a little worried,

901
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:52,340
but you see what I'm
doing with my right hand.

902
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,750
I'm going under the knee right here.

903
00:53:53,751 --> 00:53:57,650
I never really do that and I was keeping
him from going, no ham pass. So I'm like,

904
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,300
oh okay cool.
This is nice.

905
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,090
He can't go no ham pass cause I'm
holding his leg out like that.

906
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:04,430
And I've never really done that before.
This is the first time.

907
00:54:04,431 --> 00:54:08,270
It's crazy to see how my left hand.
Yeah. She can't go. No Ham pass.

908
00:54:08,271 --> 00:54:11,840
I'm holding open his legs,
so I felt comfortable.

909
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,590
Even though I didn't have the under hook,
I just had to somehow get a lockdown,

910
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:19,850
so for my people, they know,
they see me fighting like this.

911
00:54:19,851 --> 00:54:24,560
All this is every day in the gym. This is
how it looks. I start in this position.

912
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:27,560
This is how it looks.
So to the Gracie side,

913
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:31,850
they probably thought he was a winning
right here. My mom was freaking out.

914
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:33,530
My mom thought he was killing me.

915
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:37,590
This at this moment you got the lockdown
somewhere in here you got the lockdown

916
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:42,420
and when you got the lock down here, the
crowd went fucking crazy. That was crazy.

917
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:45,420
I get the lock down. My guys go
nuts. Yeah. He gets the under hook.

918
00:54:45,421 --> 00:54:48,750
His crowd goes nuts. I get the lock
down. My crowd goes nuts. That was,

919
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:52,330
it was crazy. The lockdowns way
bigger though. The the what? What?

920
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,080
For folks who don't know the lockdown.

921
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,710
When you got a guy who's really good
at it and he has you in half guard and

922
00:54:58,711 --> 00:55:03,270
slaps it on your legs in jeopardy,
you might tear your fucking knee.

923
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,090
You're getting manipulated,
you've got two legs against one,

924
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,430
and when a guy's really good at it,
a guy like Eddie,

925
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:11,280
when they're really good at it and
they have two legs against one,

926
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,380
it puts you in a precarious
position and it's,

927
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,830
it makes you vulnerable to
a lot of different sweeps.

928
00:55:16,831 --> 00:55:20,220
And here you're flipping it
backwards. Like that's when
the crowd went nuts. Well,

929
00:55:20,221 --> 00:55:23,670
dude, you're, you're, you've got
his leg in a mangled position. Here

930
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,410
is electric chair right here.
I didn't think this was the plan.

931
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:30,950
The plan was exactly what happened.
That was the plan. I was going to go,

932
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:34,160
just do what I do at the gym every night.

933
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,790
This is exactly what I do every night.
This is nothing new.

934
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:39,950
It wasn't a special strategy for Heuler.

935
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:45,190
So that was John jocks whole plan is to
get me to do what I normally do the best

936
00:55:46,971 --> 00:55:50,610
shit I'm, I'm at. Uh, did, did
do it out there on him and then

937
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,670
reversed you for a second.

938
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,920
I didn't have the leg on my shoulders so
I go let us go back and boom and get it.

939
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:58,970
So it looked like he swept me.

940
00:55:58,971 --> 00:56:02,540
But I went back to put that leg back on
my shoulder and I went rock right back

941
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:06,920
up people. Dude, I do it
all the time, you know.

942
00:56:06,921 --> 00:56:08,420
So now I'm in a position,

943
00:56:08,421 --> 00:56:11,420
this is where you rocked it with momentum
cause you had full control over that

944
00:56:11,421 --> 00:56:13,640
leg. It was just wasn't on
my shoulder. I had to go

945
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,170
and scoop it up.
So now I'm on top and now I'm an,

946
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,060
I'm in the electric chair on top and this
is where I'm talking to him. I'm like,

947
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,760
you can't do anything here. Just
relax. This is where I rest.

948
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:26,570
I went through a lot of explosion and I
rest right here. I have control of it.

949
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,410
That's why he was doing that thing with
his hands because people would want to

950
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:31,720
like, why is he throwing his hands
up in the air? Like, you know,

951
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,510
like he did that a couple of times when
you got them into side control and they

952
00:56:34,511 --> 00:56:37,810
did that and then I passed the guard.
Boom in right here. I'm, I'm still,

953
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,820
he's still stuck.
I got him in a cradle,

954
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:42,820
but that makes sense now because everybody
wondered why he was doing that with

955
00:56:42,821 --> 00:56:44,950
his hands. People are like, oh,
Hoyle, he was complaining. No,

956
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:46,870
he's complaining because you
were talking shit to him. Yeah.

957
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:51,070
You're saying you're stuck here and
maybe he was saying, I can't do nothing.

958
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:54,950
He's holding me. He's like, this is
Jiu Jitsu we're holding, we're square,

959
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,200
we're clinching and squeezing. Right.
You know, and he's all like, well,

960
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:02,110
how could he complain about that? He's
totally a mobile here. Even though I pass,

961
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:04,660
I pass, I let go the lockdown
and passed his guard.

962
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,970
The reason why the past was guaranteed,

963
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:10,540
it's because of the control I have on his
leg. I have a head and arm and the leg,

964
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,490
so that pass was easy.
As soon as I let go,

965
00:57:12,491 --> 00:57:15,190
the lockdown didn't want to let
it go until I rest a little bit.

966
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,460
And then finally I let go the leg
last and now I'm in side control.

967
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:21,280
And here's the big transition.
I thought he was going to turn into me,

968
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:24,040
but he turns away. So I'm
like, Ooh, that's even easier.

969
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:28,510
But he's rolling in a nice way.
But I had to turn it into a 100% here.

970
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,650
So this is halfway.

971
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:34,270
This is a neck crank that I do to
get the guy to give me his back.

972
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:39,120
So I'm net cranking them here and if he
pulls his left arm all the way out, um,

973
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,980
I usually transition to the back
and that's what he did right there.

974
00:57:41,981 --> 00:57:44,500
So now I'm getting up and
his left arms free now.

975
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:48,760
So all I gotta do is get up on my right
knee and then swirled in the back.

976
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:52,390
That's what I'm going to do here. I
wanted the twister. That was the plan.

977
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,010
The plan was to get them in a twister,

978
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:57,370
but he did a really good job
of just shrugging me off.

979
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:00,310
So now I gotta start over again.
So at this point I'm thinking,

980
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:02,290
this is what I'm really thinking.
Um,

981
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:07,320
I thought the most important thing is
for me is to go out there and not get

982
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:12,400
smoked and I get tapped in 20 seconds
or 30 seconds cause that would be,

983
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,580
that would crush me.
I would be the worst possible thing.

984
00:58:15,581 --> 00:58:19,570
So let's make sure that doesn't
happen. And if I lose, if I tap,

985
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:23,650
at least let me go out there and give,
we have 20 minutes.

986
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,890
Let's see some good 10 planet techniques
from my people just to show that it

987
00:58:26,891 --> 00:58:30,790
works if he taps it. So at this point I'm
thinking I did so much to them. Right.

988
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:31,630
Their Textbook,

989
00:58:31,631 --> 00:58:36,631
10th planet shit all the way through
note for note that I thought if he the

990
00:58:37,451 --> 00:58:39,400
worst case now if he
taps me on one second,

991
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,180
at least I got some good shit in my mind,
in my mind.

992
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:46,180
Cause that's how much respect I have for
right. I'm like he could still get me,

993
00:58:46,181 --> 00:58:50,560
I'm not over. We got like 13
minutes. So in my mind I already won.

994
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:54,490
I go, I want, so when you
think that way and you're,

995
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:58,990
I thought I already did all this shit.
So the worst case scenario, he tasks out.

996
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,220
I did a good job.

997
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:03,970
So for some reason that made me
just want to attack a more and go,

998
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:07,270
let's just keep putting, let's just keep
piling it up. Oh, here's another one, Dan,

999
00:59:07,271 --> 00:59:10,270
and see if I could do another
one. Oh, here's another one.
And the, I just changed.

1000
00:59:10,271 --> 00:59:12,610
Should it go? Damn. I'm not
going to go for a twister.

1001
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:15,390
I'm going to go for a vaporizer.
So when I,

1002
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,620
when I get them in an electric
chair and he doesn't tap,

1003
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:20,260
when I test this flexibility,
if they don't tap,

1004
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,630
I can just sweep them and get on
top and set them up for a twister,

1005
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:27,080
which I already tried, but
I made the decision. I go,
you know what? There's a lot.

1006
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,940
He's pretty good at shaking me off the
bat. If I just go to the vaporizer,

1007
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:33,710
it'll justice cools the twister.

1008
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:38,780
And I do it all the time and that's
good enough. So that was the plan. I go,

1009
00:59:38,781 --> 00:59:42,020
he's not stopping the electric chair.
So I'm a go back and get another another.

1010
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:44,630
I thought about rubber guard for a second,
third, and I thought, you know what?

1011
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:49,640
You see how he got the under hood? You see
that I went, rubber guard, locked down,

1012
00:59:49,641 --> 00:59:53,270
whipped him. He had the under hook, but
that whip boom, I sucked and wham Bam,

1013
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:57,290
that's a little whipped down combo,
a very important combo to master.

1014
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:58,430
And now I got the under it.

1015
00:59:58,431 --> 01:00:01,700
So I thought he's not stopping the
electric charge tonight because if he

1016
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:05,780
would've been able to, he can I,
I'm able to do electric chairs easy.

1017
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:08,000
So I knew I could just go back
and more money in the bank.

1018
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,660
I knew he couldn't stop it.
He just was perplexed here.
So I go, you know what, I'm,

1019
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:13,580
I got to go to the vaporizers that,

1020
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:18,581
which means I got to get his leg over
to my left shoulder on the other side.

1021
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,690
I need to get my head.
I want me,

1022
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:25,720
I just need to squash his leg down and
get on top in a leg drag type position,

1023
01:00:26,571 --> 01:00:30,320
but a leg drag with a
lockdown to maintain control.

1024
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:34,040
So right now I'd go back to the electric
chair for the third or fourth time and

1025
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:35,660
I was really confident at this point.

1026
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:39,080
I just knew he wasn't going to tap from
the electric chair and I didn't want to

1027
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:42,410
pass his guard, get on top and tried the
twister. I already made the decision.

1028
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:44,220
I don't know what we're
talking about here.

1029
01:00:44,221 --> 01:00:47,460
The electric chair is a move where you've
got a guy literally in a full split

1030
01:00:47,461 --> 01:00:50,130
and he could, you're controlling his
bottom leg and the other leg, your,

1031
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,960
you're forcing it up towards his head.

1032
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:55,350
Most people don't have the flexibility
to tolerate it and a lot of times they

1033
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,600
tap just from that.
You're like literally ripping their crotch

1034
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:01,660
part. Yeah. And, and right here,
you know what I didn't get,

1035
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:03,340
I didn't get the position I wanted,

1036
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:08,170
so I'm letting him get on top
so I can set it up again. I go,

1037
01:01:08,171 --> 01:01:10,510
he cannot stop it.
He can't stop my under hugs.

1038
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,300
I already knew I had him beat
on the inside. So I'm, uh,

1039
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:17,080
I'm going to set it up again and go back
to the cause. I wanted the vaporizer.

1040
01:01:17,081 --> 01:01:21,010
He foiled to vaporize. I lost control of
his leg, so I got to start over again.

1041
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:24,390
So all of these times where he's on top,
where the audience is,

1042
01:01:24,391 --> 01:01:27,720
I call the tide has shifted back and
forth. This was just you resetting

1043
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:30,620
did he could not stop my half guard game.
I've just,

1044
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,960
the confidence just kept
growing and growing.

1045
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:34,910
So even though he has
the under a guy go watch,

1046
01:01:34,911 --> 01:01:37,970
I'm going to get the under hook back.
I was already getting it back.

1047
01:01:37,971 --> 01:01:42,090
There's no way you could stop it. It
see that boom, whipped down. I go,

1048
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:44,750
I'm just going to keep doing
it. He can't stop it. So,

1049
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:48,290
and then I'm going to start all over.
I know he's not going to be able to,

1050
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,590
he's not going to shake the lockdown.
The lockdown is too strong.

1051
01:01:51,591 --> 01:01:56,060
He was never close to ever getting his
leg out. I was so confident at this point.

1052
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:59,720
I was getting a little gassed and um,
I knew I could recover.

1053
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:04,710
All he needed was like a little
time. So, um, um, to, to uh,

1054
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:09,520
hide, uh, the, the gas
enos or the gas in is, uh,

1055
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,530
the fact that I would stop breathing.
I'm dying inside,

1056
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:14,260
but I would stop breathing.
You know,

1057
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:18,800
like when Jason Walks into your house
and you're in the closet and you're like,

1058
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:23,180
but then you'd go, yeah, I was doing
that just so he wouldn't smell.

1059
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,990
Now I did it again.
I knew I could do it again.

1060
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:28,920
Now I got to get his leg to the other
side. I don't want it. Look at it at sea.

1061
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:32,520
I'm holding onto his leg. I need to get
it to the other side of my body, right?

1062
01:02:32,521 --> 01:02:35,790
So I'm like, you know what? Damn, I lost
it again. Let me, let me do it again.

1063
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,480
So look at that. I have you do it again.
They thought he reversed me, but I go,

1064
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:42,000
I'm just setting it up now. I've
got the leg over right there. Boom.

1065
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:46,160
That's where I want to be. That's
the transition right there. And I go,

1066
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:49,050
I'm going to go after. It's
like, I thought about it for
a second there, but I got,

1067
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:52,110
no, you know what, I'm going to
roll. I can't just reach back for it.

1068
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:55,260
I got to have set it up. I'm going to
set it up right here. Squash them down.

1069
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:58,770
I thought about it again, but then he
stopped it right there and I go, okay,

1070
01:02:58,771 --> 01:02:59,880
let me set it up differently.

1071
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:02,900
But then we got broke up here and
this is where all the controversial,

1072
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:04,800
what the hell was going on here.

1073
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:09,300
I knew what position we were in was top
stoner control. I knew the position.

1074
01:03:09,301 --> 01:03:12,480
I'm there all the time. He had
no idea what I was doing. So,

1075
01:03:12,481 --> 01:03:16,260
and he didn't know that. I
knew. He thought it was just
some crazy weird position.

1076
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:20,760
And uh, he didn't know where he
was. And uh, I was, I was, see,

1077
01:03:20,761 --> 01:03:23,070
I pulled guard right here and I was
going to say, here, look gimme your leg.

1078
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:23,761
Let me throw it over.

1079
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:26,250
I'm going to get on top and we're going
to go back and I show you exactly the

1080
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:29,790
whole thing. I was going to show it. I
was going to do it from the top. See,

1081
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,520
I'm trying to do it from step one,

1082
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:36,330
and then I was going to take them over
and I was showing him the sweep instead

1083
01:03:36,331 --> 01:03:38,340
of just getting in the position.
He's all confused.

1084
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:42,090
He didn't know what's going on. I'm trying
to, I go, you got to get your leg over.

1085
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,870
And he's not, he keeps
refusing. I'm like, man,

1086
01:03:45,871 --> 01:03:49,230
he's not letting me get in the position
and look. He's like, no, no, no.

1087
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:52,530
And he didn't know, uh, in his
defense, he didn't know the position,

1088
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:54,090
but I know exactly what's going on.

1089
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:58,260
He refuses to get in the position and
then I'm just thinking I need to rest a

1090
01:03:58,261 --> 01:04:01,050
little bit anyways,
so this is bullshit.

1091
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:04,770
I'm not going to argue like we were just
arguing here. He won't let me. I know.

1092
01:04:04,771 --> 01:04:08,070
Exactly. I, then I decided,
fuck that. Fuck this shit.

1093
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,650
I'm not going to get fucked here.
And the crowd was going nuts,

1094
01:04:10,651 --> 01:04:13,080
so you don't replay replay,
replay.

1095
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:17,280
And so Scott Nelson looks over right here.
He looks over to Hallock and he goes,

1096
01:04:17,281 --> 01:04:19,410
what do you want me to do?
Hallock Hallux said stand them up,

1097
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:24,120
start standing and when it like he's
going to walk over right now. And I said,

1098
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:27,390
what did he say? And then they put the
replay on, he goes, hey, Alex said,

1099
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:30,780
stand him up. He said, stand
them up. And I'm like, fuck
that. We're not standing up.

1100
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,820
And then the replay comes on and everybody
looks at the replay and then it just

1101
01:04:35,821 --> 01:04:38,850
gets down and gets into
position. I go, look, look with,

1102
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:43,690
I know a position's going on. So he
let me have it. See he said, okay. No,

1103
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,670
no resistance.

1104
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:48,870
Once the video came out there was trying
to sneak that left knee in. Yeah. Yeah.

1105
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,050
And this is top stone or control
right there. Right there.

1106
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,660
Stolen a control from the back
and there's only half of Tufts.

1107
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,810
He didn't have your risks
before. It didn't matter. It
didn't matter. None of this.

1108
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:02,550
What I want here is I want him to push me
away because I'm going to dip and roll.

1109
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:06,660
I'm going to Tuck and roll, but if he
holds onto me, I can't tuck and roll.

1110
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:07,530
It'd be holds on.

1111
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:10,800
So I got to make it look like I want to
smash them and squeeze them because I

1112
01:05:10,801 --> 01:05:13,380
could pass it anytime
the past is guaranteed.

1113
01:05:13,381 --> 01:05:17,080
Do you want the for sure pass or do you
want to try to Tuck and roll and go for

1114
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:19,270
the kill right away and
go after the vaporizer.

1115
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,280
And I thought I'm going
right for the vaporizer.

1116
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:24,190
Fuck passing his guard and then he
recovers half guard and all that shit.

1117
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,490
I wanted to go for the kill right here.
So right now I'm on my side.

1118
01:05:27,491 --> 01:05:30,130
I'm setting it up.
I need to be up on my knees,

1119
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:32,290
but just all I do is need to get up.
See I'm getting up.

1120
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,030
All they gotta do is really get on top,

1121
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:37,210
but I know I could get on top of him
anytime I want. I know this position,

1122
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:41,110
I'm just waiting. Now I'm on my knees.
I collected some gas, I recovered,

1123
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,800
he can't get out. I'm in control
here. His legs are all mangled.

1124
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:49,570
So what I want to do is turn to my
right and roll on my left shoulder.

1125
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,360
But what I am resting,
all I'm doing is rusting.

1126
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:54,820
I'm going to turn to my right
roll on my left shoulder,

1127
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:57,480
but I need him to push me.
So I see I'm,

1128
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,940
I'm selling the fact that
I want to squeeze him and I
want to see to see and now

1129
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:04,450
he's pushing away. He bought it, he bought
the fact that I want to squeeze them,

1130
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,220
so this is what I always do. So now
I'm gurgling going like I hate this.

1131
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:11,620
Like I hate this, but look, he's
going to help me see how we helped me.

1132
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:14,570
And he pushed me through. He
pushed me through like, Oh shit,

1133
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:18,550
it's done now you got this. And I
thought for sure he was going to tab.

1134
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:23,530
This is the vaporizer. No one has ever
not tapped to this. This is in my arsenal,

1135
01:06:23,531 --> 01:06:25,210
the nastiest leg lock.
This is a,

1136
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:30,130
it's a calf crank and it's a toe hold
at the same time and he can't protect

1137
01:06:30,131 --> 01:06:33,010
himself with his other leg is
other legs were on his other leg.

1138
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:34,150
So his other leg is useless.

1139
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:38,380
I can use both my arms as opposed
to the calf crank from the truck.

1140
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:39,460
The calf came from the truck.

1141
01:06:39,461 --> 01:06:44,330
You can't use both arms for fear of
getting onboard with one of them. Yeah.

1142
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:46,540
So you need to protect that other leg.
Anyways,

1143
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:48,040
he's got a free leg to break shit apart.

1144
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:51,790
But in from the vaporizer he
can't protect with his other leg.

1145
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:55,690
It's out of the mix and you could use
both arms because there's no arm bar and

1146
01:06:55,691 --> 01:06:58,810
it's a, it's, it's a leg
compression and a told in one,

1147
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:03,900
it's the nastiest leg lock in my arsenal
and the fact that his leg popped at

1148
01:07:04,661 --> 01:07:07,540
least seven times, it was popping and
crack. And I'm telling them right here,

1149
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:11,140
I'm sorry, I'm asking him. I go, dude, we
can end this. And he's like, no, see that.

1150
01:07:11,141 --> 01:07:14,200
He's like, no, I go, we can stop this.
It keeps popping. He goes, that's normal.

1151
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:17,800
That's normal. I go, it
keeps popping. And uh,

1152
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,120
he refused the tap. He refused
man. And I was Yanking,

1153
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:26,910
so I thought I'm going to, I was doing
things I never did to that they Bryson,

1154
01:07:26,911 --> 01:07:31,210
I usually just grab the toes with both
hand twisted in pool and it's really easy.

1155
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:34,630
And the calf crank from the truck.
Another thing that you need,

1156
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,720
you need to stomp your left,

1157
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,790
the inside of your left
foot with your right foot.

1158
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:44,830
You got to shove your leg
deeper into the of me nasty.

1159
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,730
But in the CAF crank, you need to stop
in this one. You don't need to stop.

1160
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:52,660
You could just keep your legs figure
for both arms. That's enough pressure.

1161
01:07:52,661 --> 01:07:53,890
Just leave your legs,
figure four.

1162
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,250
But if for some crazy reason
they don't tap like he did,

1163
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,280
then you would go to the stomp
to add even more pressure.

1164
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:05,200
But he was holding the Geeky Pant so
I could see he's holding my right leg.

1165
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:09,520
I need to use my right foot and
stomp on the inside of my left foot.

1166
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,610
I need to pull it up and stomp on
it and Matt can get his hands free.

1167
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:17,420
I can't get my leg free. You see how
he's holding it? But I mean there's,

1168
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:18,890
so I decided, you know what, I'm just,

1169
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:21,110
I generally don't need
to stomp on that foot,

1170
01:08:21,111 --> 01:08:24,500
so I'm still trying to make him tap
like everyone else taps without it,

1171
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,350
but see how he's holding it.
So I grabbed his foot,

1172
01:08:27,351 --> 01:08:30,620
I'm twisting it and I thought
there's like a minute left. I go,

1173
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:31,930
I'm going to give it everything.

1174
01:08:31,931 --> 01:08:34,490
I've got one more time and
I just grabbed his foot,

1175
01:08:34,491 --> 01:08:37,130
something I never do when
I twisted it and shoved it,

1176
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,130
like try to shove it like in his ribs,
man.

1177
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:43,970
And he still wouldn't tap and gear
this popping and he didn't care.

1178
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:45,140
He just kept going.

1179
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:48,680
He knew that if he didn't tab it would
be a draw and that's what he needed.

1180
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:51,140
He couldn't have you tap
twice. Tap him twice. Yeah.

1181
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,890
He has nothing. The fact that he's
holding onto my geek pants there,

1182
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:57,060
that's what's saving him.
You know, he crazy. Yeah,

1183
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,920
he's in serious danger right here.
If you had to do it again,

1184
01:08:59,921 --> 01:09:02,170
would you do with g pants again? Yes. Yes.

1185
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:06,430
Because the g pant made those
electric chairs so easy. He could,

1186
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,250
he was never close to pulling
his leg out of lockdown.

1187
01:09:09,251 --> 01:09:12,880
So I mean the pants,

1188
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,700
the pants were bad for
him and a lot of ways,

1189
01:09:15,701 --> 01:09:19,260
but it saved him might here in this
one position. Yeah, it did save him,

1190
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,340
but I would, yeah, I would, uh,

1191
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:25,450
I would have went back to pants anyways
with that whole pants scandal thing. Um,

1192
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:29,380
uh, asked to wear pants. They said, okay,

1193
01:09:29,381 --> 01:09:31,450
you can wear pants if you
promise not to change your mind.

1194
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:34,930
I want it to change my mind. They
said, you promised not to change it.

1195
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:40,470
And then so they made me wear
what I asked for. So, um,

1196
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,870
I met his lawyer, his lawyer, and it
ended up being really, really cool man.

1197
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:48,000
The guy that was, uh, trying
to protect a heuler from Oh,

1198
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:52,260
situations when you're twisting it. Yeah.
I'm pushing down and trying to smell.

1199
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:56,360
She's obviously in some serious pain here,
but it's incredible. He's not tapping.

1200
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:58,310
What do you think happened to the knee?

1201
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,440
If you had to guess it
was this some damage?

1202
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:03,900
Maybe.
Maybe he is knee always pops.

1203
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,030
No. Say about him. Is that
he won't tap to joint locks.

1204
01:10:07,031 --> 01:10:10,720
Like you remember when a soccer Robin
got him in that Kamora and they stopped

1205
01:10:10,721 --> 01:10:14,920
the fight and he's like, don't stop the
fight. I, I'm there all day. I'm fine.

1206
01:10:14,921 --> 01:10:19,560
Like I don't get tapped from those
things. Yeah, man. Um, so like, uh,

1207
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:24,100
Hallock said, please don't watch this
on youtube. If you do watch on Youtube,

1208
01:10:24,101 --> 01:10:28,810
please support metamorris just go
there and purchase one for 20 bucks.

1209
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,680
There's a lot of high level matches
and uh, people, it's really fun.

1210
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:36,400
People kept saying, you were going nuts.
We were going crazy. They go, dude,

1211
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:40,210
you got to get watch video. If there's
video of Joe Watching your match,

1212
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:43,750
you were just exploding. Dude. I thought
I was going to have a heart attack.

1213
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,880
I left there, I couldn't talk to
people. I ran when the match is over,

1214
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:48,320
how to get out of there.
Cause I wouldn't, it wasn't,

1215
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,440
there's no way I was gonna be able to
have a conversation with like, you know,

1216
01:10:51,441 --> 01:10:55,340
like, uh, people on the street, regular
folks I didn't know and I didn't want to,

1217
01:10:55,341 --> 01:10:58,730
uh, have that conversation with
anybody. I ran out of there. Wow. Dude.

1218
01:10:58,731 --> 01:11:02,540
My heart was pounding. Yeah, they said
you were going nuts. Were you drunk? No,

1219
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:03,374
not at all.

1220
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:04,323
Let me sober.

1221
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:09,160
Where you one of the guys
that that cheered when the
lockdown and where you kind

1222
01:11:09,161 --> 01:11:10,060
of worried in the beginning,

1223
01:11:10,061 --> 01:11:12,910
cause I was like five minutes of Jochin
was never worried. He got the under.

1224
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,160
You don't when he had the under hook?

1225
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:17,170
Nah, I didn't eat. That didn't mean enough
because it looked like the same match.

1226
01:11:17,171 --> 01:11:19,720
It looked like 2003 right.
I know too much about your game.

1227
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,820
I've seen your role too many times.
I felt it too. I know. What about,

1228
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:26,350
I know that lockdown down is hot
death. You get ahold of your leg, man.

1229
01:11:26,351 --> 01:11:29,500
That's scary shit. I hate that
feeling. You're locked down.

1230
01:11:29,501 --> 01:11:31,900
It's like you're being
compressed in between boards.

1231
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:35,290
That sort of feels like it's like you've
figured out a way to do it and you do

1232
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:39,760
it so well and you've done it for so many
years that you know the exact correct,

1233
01:11:39,761 --> 01:11:44,350
perfect angle to hit it where it's like
bone is digging in to meet your shin

1234
01:11:44,351 --> 01:11:48,670
bone is digging into meat and
you just do a thing. You know?

1235
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:51,940
I like the analogy that you always use
with tying your shoes that when you tie

1236
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:54,400
your shoes, he tied his shoes every
day. So when you go to tire shoes,

1237
01:11:54,401 --> 01:11:58,300
it's just automatic. It just
goes, it's magic. Yeah. You
don't even think about it.

1238
01:11:58,301 --> 01:12:01,600
It's just how he didn't have no command
and that just happened on its own.

1239
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:06,100
And when you do Jujitsu long enough and
you drill long enough and you were in a

1240
01:12:06,101 --> 01:12:08,290
certain position long enough,
you develop that too.

1241
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:13,350
You see it with the only
forms of movements that I'm
really knowledgeable about

1242
01:12:13,901 --> 01:12:17,860
or striking movements and
grappling movements. But
you see it in those as well.

1243
01:12:17,861 --> 01:12:20,440
And I guess you see it in everything.
You see it in throwing a football.

1244
01:12:20,441 --> 01:12:22,840
You see it in baseball.
You see it in everything.

1245
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,140
When someone gets some shit down
and they really got it down,

1246
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:31,070
like you know like Paul Sass and
his triangle, that mother Fucker,

1247
01:12:31,071 --> 01:12:31,660
you know,

1248
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:34,630
if you get caught in that guy's triangle
that that dude's been there a thousand

1249
01:12:34,631 --> 01:12:38,230
times, he's just got, he's
got a, just a feel for it.

1250
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:41,230
That extraordinary field
that rarely happens.

1251
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:45,520
Like Ronda Rousey's armbars same
kind of thing and you're locked down.

1252
01:12:45,521 --> 01:12:48,640
It's just death. And I saw that once
I saw the lockdown I was like, oh,

1253
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:51,070
he's in trouble.
Like if he let them get that,

1254
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:53,590
we're that confident.
Fuck yeah man.

1255
01:12:53,591 --> 01:12:56,680
You know I would say people were telling
me if things you were saying before

1256
01:12:56,681 --> 01:13:00,320
that matching or predictions and
man that kind of stuff scares you.

1257
01:13:00,321 --> 01:13:03,620
I'm like dude, they like you or shot
very conservative. You and John.

1258
01:13:03,621 --> 01:13:08,140
John have so much confidence
in me that that's like man,

1259
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,770
like the feeling of getting smoked and
what you guys would think like damn,

1260
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:16,370
like I didn't ever want that.
Look in your eye. That, what that,

1261
01:13:16,371 --> 01:13:20,080
that like third or fourth time that I
did a open Mike night where I was getting

1262
01:13:20,081 --> 01:13:24,310
a little confidence and that one time
I went on stage and I thought I'd,

1263
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:28,520
I'd thought I'd do something different
and not tell jokes but talk about might

1264
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:31,510
be like a comic talking about
his wife and his girlfriend,

1265
01:13:31,511 --> 01:13:35,260
but it's not really his wife and it
ends up being some stripper and he's

1266
01:13:35,261 --> 01:13:38,950
delusional and he thinks it's his
wife and I try to do that on stage,

1267
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,100
you know what I mean? Like
later, but it was, it wasn't, uh,

1268
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:46,660
no one laughed and I got off stage
and you were like, come on, follow me.

1269
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:50,290
You were like this. We
were like, you didn't,

1270
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:53,890
you couldn't even look me in the eye did.
You're like, no, no, no. You were like,

1271
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:56,580
what are we going to do back with me?

1272
01:13:56,650 --> 01:14:00,580
And you took me the back and you fucking
lectured me in a good way. He said, dude,

1273
01:14:00,581 --> 01:14:03,010
you can't do shit like that.

1274
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:06,970
You gotta be a bad motherfucker to pull
something like that. No one gets it, dude.

1275
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:08,080
You got to tell jokes,

1276
01:14:08,081 --> 01:14:12,100
he can't get up there and and try to
tell a story and it's an open mic night.

1277
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:17,170
He goes, dude, I felt like that was
like you talk about bombing on stage,

1278
01:14:17,171 --> 01:14:17,981
eat a thousand Dick's.

1279
01:14:17,981 --> 01:14:22,870
I felt that what I was trying to do is
figure out how I could describe it to you.

1280
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:25,570
The reason why I wasn't looking at you
in the Ui. So it was when we, I was like,

1281
01:14:25,571 --> 01:14:30,370
come on, come here man. All I was
thinking is how, what is the best way?

1282
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,880
Cause this is a very sensitive moment
and I knew that it'd be devastated.

1283
01:14:33,881 --> 01:14:35,620
It was a very sensitive moment.

1284
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:38,530
So I'm trying to figure out how
it look that look, that look,

1285
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:42,010
I don't want that look, I don't
want that look of, Oh that's chose.

1286
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:46,180
Look of how can it be nice to tell
me something I did was terrible.

1287
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:48,460
How could he be nice?

1288
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:53,200
Like if I went out there and the boiler
just going ankle lock in five seconds,

1289
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:56,580
like right away, just right away.
Like let's say I did something stupid.

1290
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,900
I tried to pull guard and I,

1291
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:01,340
I clowned around a little bit for five
seconds and I pulled guard and it got me

1292
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:04,540
ankle lock and I tap like before
even yank and I just happened.

1293
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:07,960
It was like early tap.
It was the worst possible case scenario.

1294
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,740
And what would you, you'd be like the same
thing it'd be um, I'd be like, ah, Shit.

1295
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:17,320
I would just say shit happens bro.
Like what could you say?

1296
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:22,030
Can you say, I didn't want that look on
your face. You know why? You know why?

1297
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:26,950
Because you the more shit you talk to
your friends and all that about I get

1298
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:29,830
Eddie's going to dominate and like
John Talks making bets with people.

1299
01:15:29,831 --> 01:15:31,870
He's betting its house
and shit. I'm like, Ooh,

1300
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:37,060
like not only you can handle me
and you like, dude, you fucked up.

1301
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:39,370
But like all that shit you
talked, you're like, damn,

1302
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:42,190
I talked a lot of shit ends on video.
That's not going to look,

1303
01:15:42,191 --> 01:15:46,200
that's going to stay. I'm going
to eat all those words. Fog.

1304
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:51,280
So that I think about that shit too.
You talk like John John's town,

1305
01:15:51,281 --> 01:15:52,530
everyone like,

1306
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,080
like someone from the Gracie family called
him up and they wanted to make a bet

1307
01:15:56,081 --> 01:15:59,140
and John Jackson, you, you want,
are you serious how sure I am.

1308
01:15:59,141 --> 01:16:01,150
He's going to win a bet your house.
You want to bet your house,

1309
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:05,260
literally bet your house. He made a
real bet and the guy wouldn't take it.

1310
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:10,050
Ooh, that's, that's crazy shit man.

1311
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:12,250
It was when I was a purple belt,

1312
01:16:12,251 --> 01:16:15,980
I was in the finals of a tournament
and John Jack was the uh,

1313
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:20,200
the ref and the dudes that
my opponent in the final,

1314
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:24,100
his coach like John John, you can't
rep this match. That's your student.

1315
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:27,640
This is ridiculous. And then John John
said, okay, you're right, this rough,

1316
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:31,450
this match doesn't need a Rep. And he sat
down next to his other coach and goes,

1317
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:35,010
cause go ahead. Start finding my boy's
going to get your boy and an arm bar.

1318
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:37,750
It's going to be as right arm.
And I,

1319
01:16:37,751 --> 01:16:40,960
everyone heard that and all
of a sudden I'm like, oh no,

1320
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:46,420
I'm fucked. Talk about pressure.
No one's ever done shit like that.

1321
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:50,680
That is a true story, man. That's
a true story. So what he sat down,

1322
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:53,740
I got the guy in iron bar so he
did it because John Jack said it,

1323
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:58,210
he says that it's almost like he says it,

1324
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:03,360
he wants me to hear it so that I have no
choice to go out there and fuck and go

1325
01:17:03,521 --> 01:17:07,930
to war. You know what I mean? Like I have
no choice fucker. You know what I mean?

1326
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:13,000
Whatever he has to say to make it happen,
he goes, I just put, because I like,

1327
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:17,110
I think he, he knows that if
there's enough pressure that I'll,

1328
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:20,900
I'll be forced to do my game. All he
wants to do is play my game. Right.

1329
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:24,590
So he had to play some psychological
warfare with me and my camp. He,

1330
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:28,820
it was all about playing my shit cause
how can I get this motherfucker to do

1331
01:17:28,821 --> 01:17:32,600
what he does here all the time. You know,
cause I haven't competed in a long time.

1332
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:35,690
I could easily folded from the
pressure people get the, you know,

1333
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:40,190
jitters 11 years, people fold.
This is a huge match, man.

1334
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,160
10 planet against,
you know,

1335
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:44,980
versus a Gracie like right
there and our hometowns and,

1336
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:48,500
and everyone's screaming and there's
some crazy shit, a lot of pressure.

1337
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:52,880
My family and my mom, I
thought my, my son, my wife
was there. I'm like, Holy Shit.

1338
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:55,250
My Mom's and my wife's. I was
just like a, this is like,

1339
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:59,060
like I'm at the MGM granted some
main event. I'm like, Holy Shit.

1340
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:03,830
That's what it is. So much pressure
place was pat my head instructors,

1341
01:18:03,831 --> 01:18:07,930
all my students, all the shit you
talk, John Shock, all of these ev,

1342
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:12,500
all this pressure. So I
thought, man, there's a chat.
People fold under pressure.

1343
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:15,530
There's a lot of pressure,
all different kinds of dimensions.

1344
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,030
And will I be one of those dudes a
fault? But what I realize is, is that,

1345
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,840
uh, I do want to, I did want to
win. I did want to do my best.

1346
01:18:23,841 --> 01:18:26,330
That's the most important.
Just clear out all the bullshit.

1347
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:30,200
Do you want to do your best? Yes. The best
thing is to do your shit. Go after them.

1348
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,530
Trust your cardio,
go after.

1349
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:36,350
And all those little leaks on this.
Damn,

1350
01:18:36,351 --> 01:18:38,040
that was about to burst
with all this pressure,

1351
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:41,600
all these leaks I could fix all these
leaks and how to do is focused on one

1352
01:18:41,601 --> 01:18:46,370
thing. Just going after him and trusting
myself. Okay, cool. Cool. So then Bam,

1353
01:18:46,371 --> 01:18:48,350
it was all about, dude,
you have no choice.

1354
01:18:48,351 --> 01:18:50,300
Go out there and fucking make it happen.

1355
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,700
You know you're not folding
under this pressure.

1356
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:56,390
You're going to do it and you're going
to go after him 100% and you're going to

1357
01:18:56,391 --> 01:19:00,920
do your best. Did you think
about doing it? Hi. No, not
at all. No. Too much pressure.

1358
01:19:00,921 --> 01:19:04,010
Too much pressure.
When you're under pressure,

1359
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:07,940
I don't suggest inhalation of cannabis.

1360
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:12,890
What am I a light edible? No, I didn't
even want to take us so much weed in me.

1361
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:16,010
I want them.
The one thing I learned at John Johnson,

1362
01:19:16,011 --> 01:19:20,630
I was never stoned when I went to John
jocks cause I wanted to make sure we

1363
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:24,440
trained at the same time we were going
to compete. I wanted to train right.

1364
01:19:24,441 --> 01:19:26,720
There was that same time,
like six 30 ish,

1365
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:30,310
seven 30 or seven and that
area just get my body going.

1366
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:34,880
A million percent shark tank,
like a motherfucker getting my ass kick.

1367
01:19:34,881 --> 01:19:38,120
And I never had been tapped so much in
my life going through these shark tanks.

1368
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,560
It's crazy.
It feels,

1369
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:43,280
it doesn't feel great to constantly get
tapped by people and getting fucking

1370
01:19:43,281 --> 01:19:47,630
wrecked, you know, trying to last
an hour straight with fresh animals,

1371
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:48,411
black belts,

1372
01:19:48,411 --> 01:19:52,040
waiting to jump on you and start on your
back and starting the mount sort of bad

1373
01:19:52,041 --> 01:19:54,140
position.
I was getting fucked up dude.

1374
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:59,450
And it's the only way to do
it though, right? Yeah. Yeah.

1375
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:03,830
Um, and the swimming, that was really a
fascinating thing that we talked about.

1376
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:08,310
Yeah. The swimming, the swimming was
important because I'm not a real athlete.

1377
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:12,690
I don't ever do cardio.
I do Jujitsu for the it,

1378
01:20:12,691 --> 01:20:16,220
for the fun of it and it, the fact
that keeps you in shape. That's uh,

1379
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:20,520
that's awesome. Beautiful. Kill two birds
with one stone. It's fun. It's awesome.

1380
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:23,520
My job is teaching people on a
strangle each other and break limbs.

1381
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,840
Fucking lucky. Embrace
that shit. I love it. Uh,

1382
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:31,500
competing is different. You're, there
were days where I got to see my son,

1383
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:34,320
five minutes here, five minutes
there, day after day. I'm like, damn,

1384
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:38,100
I'm not seeing might son that much.
I like, can't wait to get home just,

1385
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:40,410
just to get home before he goes to sleep,

1386
01:20:40,411 --> 01:20:43,640
just so I could see them for
five minutes. And Mike, man, uh,

1387
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:46,680
my wife's under a lot of pressure. She's
handling everything. I'm always training.

1388
01:20:46,681 --> 01:20:50,340
Everything's on my schedule.
Everything is priority is me.

1389
01:20:50,341 --> 01:20:53,550
And that's not the way it's always been.
You know, we work together, but the,

1390
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,020
I told her this two months,
I go,

1391
01:20:55,021 --> 01:20:59,880
I could lock my way up in big bear and
I'd be away from you guys and do it that

1392
01:20:59,881 --> 01:21:03,640
way. That's a good idea. If people heard
I did that, they would think, buck,

1393
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,790
he's doing the right thing,
but,

1394
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:10,970
or I could train hard and you let me do
whatever the hell I want to do for this

1395
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:16,110
match. And I don't want to
hear any, uh, I don't, uh,

1396
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:18,780
I have to be able to do with
without any stress. Cause we have a,

1397
01:21:18,781 --> 01:21:23,010
we have a baby boy and we, we turn it off.
It's a, it's a team. It's a management.

1398
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:27,330
I got my time. She's got her time, you
know, and we work together. But this camp,

1399
01:21:27,331 --> 01:21:30,780
I said I can go to big bear and
you have to take care of them 24,

1400
01:21:30,781 --> 01:21:34,050
seven or I could stay here
but you still take care of.

1401
01:21:34,051 --> 01:21:36,150
But I get to see him too
in between all this shits.

1402
01:21:36,151 --> 01:21:37,830
I'm still here with the
family as much as I can,

1403
01:21:37,831 --> 01:21:41,200
but I need you to understand the man.

1404
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:45,990
She was just did everything
and made sure that my geek,

1405
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:47,940
you know,
man,

1406
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:52,530
she's just amazing and I'm so,
it was beautiful though.

1407
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,900
The training camp was beautiful,
so I thought,

1408
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:59,100
should I do the Marcella Garcia
thing? He's, and he says,

1409
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:02,280
I don't do any strength and conditioning.
I don't do any conditioning.

1410
01:22:02,281 --> 01:22:06,850
I just trained you. You'd it too hard
every day. I don't know how many hours.

1411
01:22:06,851 --> 01:22:09,270
See that's what Marcella does. And he
gets away with it. He doesn't do anything.

1412
01:22:09,271 --> 01:22:09,541
Actually,

1413
01:22:09,541 --> 01:22:12,540
he just does Jujitsu and some sense
you've heard that from several people like

1414
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,990
Pedro, his Oh said that all I do is
MMA. That's it. I don't do anything.

1415
01:22:15,991 --> 01:22:18,270
I was to do any card soccer.
Robin ever did cardio,

1416
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:22,860
but generally 99% of professional
athletes have a cardio program.

1417
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:26,610
They got a system and they got trainers
and they'd have clocks and they got,

1418
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:28,080
they got the heart rate,

1419
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:31,050
they got the thing on the heart and then
the pull nothing on the arm and it's a

1420
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:33,930
science and they master
their body and Ooh,

1421
01:22:33,931 --> 01:22:36,600
look what the body does all
its better here and then,

1422
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:41,250
and they've mastered that
Shit. Uh, Marcella doesn't
do that. So I thought, man,

1423
01:22:41,251 --> 01:22:44,820
it's way better. It's
easier, it's lazier. If I,

1424
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,070
if I just fucking just
try to just do Jujitsu.

1425
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:53,010
But I thought about that for the first
week of camp once it was official,

1426
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:54,750
but then I thought,
you know what?

1427
01:22:54,751 --> 01:22:58,290
I don't want to go into this
match with any fucking doubts.

1428
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:01,830
Let me get my cardio on. The
professional tip, you know,

1429
01:23:01,831 --> 01:23:04,110
for once in your life train,
like a professional athlete.

1430
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:07,930
I was already lifting weights three years,
so I was already strong. I was ready.

1431
01:23:07,931 --> 01:23:10,150
I go, when I got offered the
fight, I was like, Kelly,

1432
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:14,620
I'm stronger than I've ever been. I was
already in good shape to teach and stuff,

1433
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:19,090
but I never did cardio. So I decided,
okay, fuck it. I'm going to do cardio.

1434
01:23:19,091 --> 01:23:22,690
Like a professional athlete. What should
I do? I don't like to run. Sign up.

1435
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:27,180
You run, you swim or you bike,
you know, that's good enough. Uh,

1436
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:31,820
for 2003, I did the rock climbing
treadmill. Remember that Shit at 25,

1437
01:23:31,821 --> 01:23:34,930
I can't remember that shit. Right. We
did like three minutes and then pop up.

1438
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:38,390
I don't remember the time thing.
I was just doing rounds. Yeah,

1439
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:42,100
I think it was like whatever the
rounds were. And Abu Dhabi. Yeah. Yeah.

1440
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:46,930
So I don't really remember too much of
what I was thinking back then. Again,

1441
01:23:46,931 --> 01:23:51,540
I never, I just, I did
that for 2005. I would,

1442
01:23:51,541 --> 01:23:54,220
I'll be too, I thought, okay, this
is fun. Treadmill, rock climbing.

1443
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:57,880
But I got hurt 2005 I would dominate.
So this time I thought,

1444
01:23:57,881 --> 01:24:00,820
and then I started swimming when I was
using your pool and I started swimming.

1445
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,880
I think that was for the palm peanut
fight. I go, fuck the Treadmill,

1446
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:07,000
rock climbing, let me try swimming.
So I'd swim, I swam a little bit.

1447
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:10,450
And then that the Katrina had, that
didn't end up happening. So again,

1448
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,540
I'm not a professional athlete, but
I decided, fuck it, I got six weeks,

1449
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:17,050
let me get my cardio together
professionally. We go in there and uh,

1450
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:21,070
the one thing I, I decided to swim, go
into 24 hour fitness down a big ass clock.

1451
01:24:21,071 --> 01:24:23,470
I didn't even know what I was going to
do. I just thought, okay, well let me,

1452
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:28,360
let me do, let me just sprint,
sprint or across the pool.

1453
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:31,900
See how long it takes. There's a, as
soon as the clock hit 12 I sprinted.

1454
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:36,850
And it took me either from like 20
to 30 seconds to get across the pool.

1455
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:39,010
So I decided,
you know what I'm going to do 20 times,

1456
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:43,480
I'm going to sprint across the pool and
and rest the remainder of that minute.

1457
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,300
And as soon as the clock hits the
12 Pam spread across again and,

1458
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:49,400
and then whenever I get their rest,

1459
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:54,640
the rest of the minute and every time
they had hits 12 go and I do that 20 times

1460
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,840
just because we was 20 minute rounds.
I don't know.

1461
01:24:57,850 --> 01:25:00,130
I don't know if it was too much
or too little and said, hey,

1462
01:25:00,131 --> 01:25:01,330
it's symbolic or whatever.

1463
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:05,980
So I know sprinting a hundred
percent running 20 times is a lot.

1464
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:09,430
Sometimes you want to do 10 sprints or
you want to do the sand dunes spring up

1465
01:25:09,431 --> 01:25:13,030
the sand and six times or seven times,
I've said 20 times it's 20 minutes.

1466
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,410
That might not be that much.

1467
01:25:14,411 --> 01:25:18,910
But what I learned about myself
is how long it takes to recover.

1468
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:20,530
That was the most
important thing I didn't,

1469
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:24,550
that would have fucked me up
in this fight. If I didn't
do the cardio I want to,

1470
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:26,770
I would have fell apart.
I would've, I would've,

1471
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,610
I didn't understand how the heart works.
So Jen, you know, I've been training uh,

1472
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:34,180
consistently since 2003 at my gym.

1473
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,480
And the way I treated my cardio
was I would go as hard as I can.

1474
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,270
And then once I start
gassing, I thought, okay,

1475
01:25:40,271 --> 01:25:41,740
the rest of this round
I'm going to hold on,

1476
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:45,460
sit on my ass for maybe five minutes,
maybe 10 minutes,

1477
01:25:45,461 --> 01:25:48,460
depending on I'm not training for anything
and then get my second wind and then

1478
01:25:48,461 --> 01:25:50,440
come back.
That's what I thought cardio was,

1479
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,900
is like you go once you're out
of gas, hey, you're out of gas.

1480
01:25:52,901 --> 01:25:55,990
You're going to need some rest.
Settle down for a while. You got far,

1481
01:25:55,991 --> 01:25:58,270
you've got seven minutes,
you have seven minutes before you gas.

1482
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,493
That's what I thought it was seven.

1483
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:03,620
I didn't know about recovery and the
mastery of recovery and that gas that you

1484
01:26:03,621 --> 01:26:05,510
can recover from that easy.
You just got to know you can,

1485
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:08,900
if you don't think you can, you
won't. So by doing those sprints,

1486
01:26:08,901 --> 01:26:13,130
he gave you confidence that you could
use 100% of your energy like around it.

1487
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:16,640
I would see you doing like what
kind of swimming? Just swim.

1488
01:26:16,641 --> 01:26:21,620
Basic fucking swimming like a lake, you
know what I mean? Your breast stroke like,

1489
01:26:21,621 --> 01:26:25,610
yes. What is that called?
One Rep. Left arm. Right arm.

1490
01:26:25,611 --> 01:26:28,120
What does it freestyle.
Okay.

1491
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:33,790
Just like a retard. I'm not
bad. You just trying to,

1492
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:38,390
I'm just ranting. I'm panicking
across the pool. Okay, so by the time,

1493
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:41,030
the first time I get a bye,
the first one,

1494
01:26:41,031 --> 01:26:46,031
it's not that I get by like that was
the first one I spent it and I'm waiting

1495
01:26:46,711 --> 01:26:49,460
inside of me and I'm like, I could really
just keep going, but I'm just like,

1496
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,880
this is what I'm doing. So at, you know,
after like the third one, I was like,

1497
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:56,720
I'm at the edge of the pool.
I got this,

1498
01:26:57,860 --> 01:26:58,940
I got 30 seconds,

1499
01:26:58,941 --> 01:27:03,860
35 seconds to recover at the 10th one
thinking about quitting after every

1500
01:27:03,861 --> 01:27:07,280
spirit. Am I good people at the pool,

1501
01:27:07,281 --> 01:27:10,330
there's old ladies by the sauna
there likes to watching this go, Ooh,

1502
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:11,770
this tattooed God.
Dang the,

1503
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:15,220
and I got 10 more to go

1504
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:18,800
dying.

1505
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,260
But I know that.
But when there's,

1506
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:24,410
when the clock hits the eight I'm dying.

1507
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:27,350
When it hits the nine I'm dying
when it's a 10 still dying,

1508
01:27:27,351 --> 01:27:32,120
but damn right before his day 11 take a
big deep breath ready to go because you

1509
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:35,660
have to go at that 12 and the crazy thing
about it is you don't need a trainer

1510
01:27:35,661 --> 01:27:39,110
to tell you to hurry up because you're
going across the pool as fast as you can.

1511
01:27:39,111 --> 01:27:41,720
Cause you're, you want an a lot
of time to rest and recover.

1512
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:44,840
You'll racing for that recovery time.
So there's no way,

1513
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:49,250
I never went a hundred percent I had to
go as 100% as fast as I can get across

1514
01:27:49,251 --> 01:27:53,480
that pool so I can rest. So as
you never didn't go 100% yes, yes.

1515
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:55,040
I didn't need anybody
to tell him. I go, dude,

1516
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:58,910
I know I'm trying to rest on that
mother about it. I'm trying to arrest.

1517
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,750
So it makes me, it did. It kicks my ass.

1518
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:07,490
I want to quit it for tech.
I did a lot for teens, a lot
of them. So it's all good.

1519
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:10,910
I could do it. I still gained, I made
gains the day. I don't have to go 20.

1520
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:15,650
I'm like, fuck, I'm not 15. I'm like, I
could do fuck five seems like so many.

1521
01:28:15,651 --> 01:28:18,650
I'm like, fuck, when I'm like at
seven or eight and I'm on my blog,

1522
01:28:18,651 --> 01:28:21,410
I've got 12 more. Ha and you
can't stop. You're on a clock.

1523
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:26,240
When that clock hits 12 you've got
to go. You know? So it's a nightmare.

1524
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:30,440
It's torture. No one's forcing me
to do it, but I just fucking do it.

1525
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,140
And I did it twice a week.
And to some,

1526
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,030
there's some cardio machines
out there that lap at that.

1527
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:38,480
They think that's nothing. And uh, there's
professional athletes go to, we weren't,

1528
01:28:38,481 --> 01:28:40,280
well, that's just because
you build up from a base.

1529
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:43,800
And these guys have been going at
it like that for a long time. Yeah.

1530
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:46,120
But what ended up happening? Hah. Uh,

1531
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:49,160
I dunno how football player would do
it or if that's fucking child's play or

1532
01:28:49,161 --> 01:28:52,040
whatever. But what it did
for my Jujitsu automatically.

1533
01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:55,250
I knew in the middle
of that our shark tank,

1534
01:28:55,251 --> 01:28:59,270
when I hit that first [inaudible] I
knew you just tell yourself, dude,

1535
01:28:59,271 --> 01:29:03,540
you could recover. Find this place to out
conserve your energy. Wait 30 seconds,

1536
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:08,250
it's going to come back. And
then I'm back. Oh my God. Cool.

1537
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,170
So at first you're like,
oh shit,

1538
01:29:10,171 --> 01:29:13,290
I want a two weeks ago
before I started doing this,

1539
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:18,210
I would have said it's over son. I ran
out of gas. I'm going to stop. I got,

1540
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:20,860
I did good. I got seven minutes,
got eight and it's got 12 minutes.

1541
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:25,640
That's not the way it was. So out. Keep
going for an hour, dude. My muscles would,

1542
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:29,310
our muscles would be tired. More tired
than my heart. My heart could keep going.

1543
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:32,880
I used to be dead after that.
That shark tank in the beginning for our,

1544
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,920
I'll be dead just from the shark tank did.

1545
01:29:34,921 --> 01:29:37,650
I wasn't even getting that tired
after shark tank. That's incredible.

1546
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:40,920
There were some, there was times
where a shark tank is people.

1547
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:45,660
You've said that term a couple
times. Um, uh, there's, you know,

1548
01:29:45,661 --> 01:29:48,930
you get as many guys as
you want in the shark tank.

1549
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:52,290
It's dedicated at one person obviously
dedicated to me on this training camp.

1550
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:56,970
I'd get in the middle and they'd be, you
know, three to 10 guys sitting around,

1551
01:29:56,971 --> 01:29:57,661
black belt,

1552
01:29:57,661 --> 01:30:01,080
purple belt and they're all waiting their
turn to get there five minutes with me,

1553
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,930
like starting on my back, starting
in the mouth, all these positions,

1554
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:06,960
some like in my guard
or I'm in their guard.

1555
01:30:07,030 --> 01:30:09,600
Just all of these positions inside
controlling me on the belly with the under

1556
01:30:09,601 --> 01:30:12,360
hook on the back a lot,
a lot,

1557
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:16,500
mount a lot and man,
just fresh guys coming in.

1558
01:30:16,501 --> 01:30:21,240
All my best guys coming in get mangled
and tapped and cause I'm trying to

1559
01:30:21,241 --> 01:30:24,870
conserve my energy. I'm trying to last
an hour, but you know, then you're like,

1560
01:30:24,871 --> 01:30:27,660
dude, you got to trust your cardio. You
can't conserve. You had a bad night.

1561
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:31,770
I was having bad nights, good nights,
bad nights, a lot of shit, Sean shock,

1562
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:32,940
you know.
Uh,

1563
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:37,650
the main thing is I didn't want to go
in there and be too cautious and goes 20

1564
01:30:37,651 --> 01:30:38,610
minutes.
I bet it would be.

1565
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:41,820
Cause I would get that way in shark
tank sometimes where I'm like,

1566
01:30:41,821 --> 01:30:44,220
dude I got Sean Ballinger next,
I got Jared Carlson,

1567
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:46,920
I gotta save my energy
with this dude cause I got,

1568
01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:50,010
I'm looking around as I'm rolling
of the shark tank going, Oh my God,

1569
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,540
these guys are coming after me.

1570
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:55,200
So I would just be really conservative
and what that would happen that would,

1571
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:58,740
I train these killers, right? They
know how to close the fucking deal.

1572
01:30:58,950 --> 01:31:01,710
So anybody pays cautious with you.
That's part of the game.

1573
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,680
You just keep getting deeper and deeper
and deeper. And that's what happened.

1574
01:31:04,681 --> 01:31:08,040
I was just sinking in quicksand with
that mentality of trying to conserve and

1575
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:12,570
not really attacking cause the attack
is what puts them on defense and stops

1576
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:16,650
there forward march.
So you have to constantly,

1577
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:20,910
even if you don't have a game
plan right now, just disrupt them.

1578
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:24,930
So what percentage do you think your your
game improved because your cardio bump?

1579
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:27,270
1000% because now I knew.

1580
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:31,080
Now I knew that I would've
thought that in and I would dive.

1581
01:31:31,081 --> 01:31:35,610
As soon as I started breathing hard
that it was over done, I did what I can.

1582
01:31:35,611 --> 01:31:38,340
Now I'm breathing. I didn't know
that. You can recover over and over.

1583
01:31:38,341 --> 01:31:39,240
When the swim sprints,

1584
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:43,170
you're reminded over and over your dad
and you did another sprint. Your Dad,

1585
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:46,920
you did another sprint, you kept going.
You were dead at 10 and you kept going.

1586
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,950
You kept recovering and you
recover. Quit. And after,

1587
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:53,970
after reminding yourself that
you can recover during Jujitsu,

1588
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,940
during those starts, Angela,
you can recover relaxed.

1589
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:58,830
You're gonna recover instead of panicking
because if you panic and think you can

1590
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,820
now you had a downward
spiral with your cardio,

1591
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:04,000
that panic will suck up more than
it's going to be harder to recover.

1592
01:32:04,001 --> 01:32:05,350
Cause you're panicking.
You think it's over.

1593
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:07,510
But once you get to the point
where you know you can recover,

1594
01:32:07,511 --> 01:32:11,470
you stop telling Yourself, oh, I can
recover it. Relax. You just do it.

1595
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,960
You're huffing and puffing.
You're not even worried.

1596
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:15,940
There's not even an ounce of panic.

1597
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,000
You know you're going to come back and
that is what that performance Saturday

1598
01:32:21,491 --> 01:32:25,780
night was all about is knowing that
I could recover. That was huge.

1599
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:28,540
There were times where I didn't want
to see him smell blood and I go,

1600
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:31,450
I just need the time recover. I would
talk to John John, stop breathing.

1601
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:34,760
I'm trying to recover not just John John,

1602
01:32:34,770 --> 01:32:37,330
how much like time and looking over
trying to act like it's nothing,

1603
01:32:37,331 --> 01:32:40,600
but meanwhile I just want him to
relax. We're not doing it. Just relax,

1604
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:45,310
relax and there are no, no need to hush
now, but those were all mental games,

1605
01:32:45,311 --> 01:32:48,310
but that was only because
I was doing that naturally.

1606
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,350
It was only because I knew I
need a little time to recover.

1607
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:53,470
I didn't know the professional
athletes shit before.

1608
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,840
This is like nothing new
to professional athletes.

1609
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,580
What I'm doing is I'm letting people that
aren't professional answers and never

1610
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:02,420
done cardio.
This is what you discover.

1611
01:33:02,421 --> 01:33:06,880
This is why cardio is so important is
understanding how your body can recover.

1612
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:09,960
Kendall Grovesite asked me once after
he did the ultimate fighter said,

1613
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:14,110
learn from Tito. He just said, cardio
is everything, man. It's everything.

1614
01:33:14,111 --> 01:33:15,520
He just couldn't stop
stressing and he's like,

1615
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:17,920
I'm a different fighter because of cardio.
Yeah.

1616
01:33:17,970 --> 01:33:22,450
If you got the ability to keep going off
to your cardio diminishes the ability

1617
01:33:22,451 --> 01:33:23,880
to recover that,

1618
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:27,550
that and knowing that you can recover
and having faith in your body.

1619
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:31,660
You never panic. You just keep
going. You just know this thing.

1620
01:33:31,661 --> 01:33:32,770
Not that I'm just going to chill here.

1621
01:33:32,771 --> 01:33:35,940
It's going to co there's
back I got now I got power.

1622
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:40,030
Now you can throw a combination and
then you wait for that green light.

1623
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:45,550
Now you can just combination women.
Maury Smith, remember Maury Smith? Yeah.

1624
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:48,660
He used to do a lot of swimming.
Maurice was a UFC heavyweight champion.

1625
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:52,770
He was a champion. Kickboxer he
was a fucking extreme fighting.

1626
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:55,120
Remember he was like one of the first
cars. They were winning by head kick.

1627
01:33:55,360 --> 01:34:00,360
I could barely walk after I was done with
20 I got out of the pool and the main

1628
01:34:00,881 --> 01:34:03,970
thing is at the very end you gotta walk.
You got to keep your body moving.

1629
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:06,100
You got, so I would walk
around the pony up to walk.

1630
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:08,740
It's good to walk when you're super tired.

1631
01:34:08,741 --> 01:34:12,670
So your body gets used to moving while
it's recovering. Yeah. Why is it bad?

1632
01:34:12,671 --> 01:34:14,630
They'll just lie down. I've
heard it's bad to lie down. Yeah,

1633
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:18,490
because then your body gets used to
having to have everything shut down to

1634
01:34:18,491 --> 01:34:19,324
recover.

1635
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:24,100
You want to be able to recover and
still beyond 30% you know what I mean?

1636
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:28,750
It's probably better to recover,
jog a little bit and then cool down.

1637
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:29,470
You know what I mean?

1638
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:31,870
And they get to the point now where
you're recovering and you never stopped

1639
01:34:31,871 --> 01:34:34,390
jogging. That's probably
the best. I'm just guessing.

1640
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:38,650
But for sure when you can barely walk
and you're dead and talk to try to walk

1641
01:34:38,651 --> 01:34:42,400
and to try to keep going,
that's the very least you can do for sure.

1642
01:34:42,401 --> 01:34:44,020
Lying down is not the cause.
John.

1643
01:34:44,021 --> 01:34:46,660
Jack never let me line and get up and
keep walking. You want to recover?

1644
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:48,370
Because when I would get to
that point in the beginning,

1645
01:34:48,371 --> 01:34:51,670
I would have walked around. I'm walking
around in John, I could barely walk.

1646
01:34:51,671 --> 01:34:53,800
I keep walking,
you got to keep the body moving.

1647
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:56,020
So it's all basic shit
that I'm sure people know.

1648
01:34:56,021 --> 01:35:01,021
But for the people that have
never dove into competing or uh,

1649
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:02,030
doing cardio,

1650
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:06,560
I'm telling you a 43 years old and I'm
just discovering the magical powers of

1651
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:10,970
mastering your body and knowing how fast
it can recover and when you have that

1652
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:14,900
kind of confidence, that's, that's
what that performance is all about.

1653
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:18,650
Trusting my cardio and I was able to
do it. It's about putting in the work.

1654
01:35:18,651 --> 01:35:21,560
You just put it in a tremendous amount
of work, two months worth of work,

1655
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:25,790
the cardio work along with all the Jujitsu
Shark tanks and all the training and

1656
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:26,301
sparring.

1657
01:35:26,301 --> 01:35:31,301
And Roland constantly spent a lot
of time with leg lock defense.

1658
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:35,540
A lot of time. Wow. And
those guys out there,

1659
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:40,130
I was getting help from so many guys at
their Max Bishop, uh, catch wrestler out.

1660
01:35:40,131 --> 01:35:45,090
And uh, and uh, I think he's an
Alabama somewhere out there and he's a,

1661
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:49,240
I know him through Alan Belcher.
He was a got helped him with Paul Harris.

1662
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:53,150
He's a lot of guys helped
Alan Belcher with Paul hearts.

1663
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:57,950
Alan Belcher's DVD immunity. That
helped me a lot with, I was, I was on a,

1664
01:35:57,951 --> 01:36:02,951
I'm on a defensive a mission now I'm on
a mission to structurize and just get

1665
01:36:04,071 --> 01:36:07,640
all the best defense from everybody and
that most of it is from John Shock Cause

1666
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:12,660
John John Defensively is probably the
one of the best ever as defenses is

1667
01:36:12,711 --> 01:36:13,544
legendary.

1668
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:18,700
And so I'm just one by one every position
figuring out what are the absolute

1669
01:36:20,091 --> 01:36:24,710
best defense that things to do or should
your hands be, where should the legs be?

1670
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,630
And when it comes to defense,

1671
01:36:26,631 --> 01:36:30,230
it's amazing because it's almost a
hundred times more complex than offense.

1672
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:35,410
There's so much to defense because there's
only a few ways to build a skyscraper

1673
01:36:36,111 --> 01:36:38,030
or you know, to build
it right. There's rules,

1674
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:42,620
but there's a million ways to
knock that motherfucker down.

1675
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:43,761
You know what I mean?

1676
01:36:43,761 --> 01:36:47,240
There's so many ways that disrupt and
it's so many different levels. You know,

1677
01:36:47,241 --> 01:36:48,920
you could come up with all
these different angles,

1678
01:36:48,921 --> 01:36:52,550
so many missiles and demos and all
that shit. You know what I mean?

1679
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:57,220
Same thing with, uh, techniques
and triangles there, the setup,

1680
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,880
there's so many steps to the setup.

1681
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:02,570
So there's so many different places along
the way where you could disrupt that.

1682
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,540
Nip it in the bud at different levels.
And then at the end,

1683
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:10,070
the one thing I've learned is
all these top guys, Alan Belcher,

1684
01:37:10,071 --> 01:37:14,110
Max Bishop, Eric Paulson,
uh, go car to beat you.

1685
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,490
And I was going to work with them.
I just never got around with it.

1686
01:37:16,491 --> 01:37:20,100
But I did work with Caren Darryl
Beatty and from Hyaston, uh,

1687
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:23,990
he came down to a shark tank and
just fucking wrecked my legs. Man.

1688
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:28,820
Current Europeans, a beast. It's
about a mother fucker. Oh yeah. So,

1689
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:33,200
um, I, I dean a dean lister,
we were texting back and forth.

1690
01:37:33,201 --> 01:37:37,280
I was like on like texting people videos
and stuff on my leg lock master friends

1691
01:37:37,281 --> 01:37:40,400
and they're like Eric Paulson and dean
lister and Manny getting parian and all

1692
01:37:40,401 --> 01:37:42,950
these guys getting their advice every,

1693
01:37:42,951 --> 01:37:46,340
but everyone has a different
way of escaping 50, 50.

1694
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:49,430
Everyone has a different way of
addressing a straight ankle lock,

1695
01:37:49,431 --> 01:37:51,080
everything to heal hooks.
Everybody's,

1696
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:55,680
there's so many different ways to fuck
up perfection, a perfect submission,

1697
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:56,820
so many different ways.

1698
01:37:56,821 --> 01:38:01,821
And it's fascinating that there's
way more defense in there,

1699
01:38:02,671 --> 01:38:05,040
his office and all these
different things to learn.

1700
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:08,520
And then what I'm doing is I'm so
fascinated with this, uh, it's,

1701
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:14,060
it's just I'm on a quest to make 10 planet
just known for their defense and it's

1702
01:38:16,711 --> 01:38:19,280
fun. It's like a new thing. Like
why I'm so obsessed with it, man.

1703
01:38:19,281 --> 01:38:21,570
I'm on watching defensive
videos all the time,

1704
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:23,550
just trying to come up
with the ultimate defense.

1705
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:27,780
And what it does is not only is it making
10th planet stronger as an association,

1706
01:38:27,781 --> 01:38:30,960
but it's making my game stronger.
Why wouldn't I want to be,

1707
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:35,550
have like amazing defense? I've always
been focused on Gnocchi or fence.

1708
01:38:35,551 --> 01:38:38,430
That's always been the problem in MMS.
What I was trying to fix,

1709
01:38:38,431 --> 01:38:41,400
that's what 10 plant was all about
is what are the problems and MMI,

1710
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:43,830
the problems or bottom game.
So we're going to be bottom game happy,

1711
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:47,310
we're going to be Nogi heavy and we're
going to have strikes in the mix.

1712
01:38:47,311 --> 01:38:48,780
That's the problem.
Would you Jitsu.

1713
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:52,200
The problem isn't that a Jujitsu
guys are tapping on the UFC.

1714
01:38:52,201 --> 01:38:55,500
There's all these black belts are tapping.
We need to fix the defense.

1715
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:59,370
Nobody was tapping these black belts.
They just were getting beat on their back.

1716
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:02,070
That was the prom song.
Well, our defense is fine.

1717
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:04,950
You keep working on the defense
over that Gracie Baha. Uh,

1718
01:39:04,951 --> 01:39:08,700
we're going to try to fix the pro this,
there's emergency Jujitsu is,

1719
01:39:08,701 --> 01:39:10,110
we needed some urgent care here.

1720
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:14,460
We need some scientists on the case
and all my students, all my moon heads,

1721
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:17,970
my head instructors were all there.
All my and our agents and all my science.

1722
01:39:17,971 --> 01:39:22,360
We need to fix my fucking problem
for Jujitsu. Keep working on your uh,

1723
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:27,000
uh, passing from standing, which is
not a problem. And mmn it's like, man,

1724
01:39:27,001 --> 01:39:28,140
they can't pass standing.

1725
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:33,210
The problem is they're not doing
much off their back authentically.

1726
01:39:33,211 --> 01:39:36,960
And that's what we're trying to do or
trying to fix that problem. And um,

1727
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,130
Ooh,
what's that?

1728
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:43,780
It's a fascinating thing to watch while
she put together this whole system and

1729
01:39:43,781 --> 01:39:47,880
other other guys inside your
system. Watch them add moves. And,

1730
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:52,510
and you know, and, and, and build it all
and figure it all out and watch it evolve.

1731
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:54,850
You know, it's always been
intriguing. Interesting too.

1732
01:39:54,851 --> 01:39:58,000
When I get injured and then come back,
get injured, take a few months off,

1733
01:39:58,001 --> 01:40:01,120
come back, oh no, we're not even doing
that anymore. We found a new path.

1734
01:40:01,150 --> 01:40:04,150
Like there's all these new paths that
come up or a new way to get around

1735
01:40:04,151 --> 01:40:08,950
something. And this cuts to the chase and
this is quicker. Someone once made the,

1736
01:40:08,951 --> 01:40:13,000
uh,
the analogy of Jujitsu to chess and a,

1737
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:17,470
and most people like love that analogy,
but you rejected it immediately.

1738
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:21,780
You know, I said, Jujitsu makes
chess look like checkers. Yeah.

1739
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:26,890
And there's also so many different
things involved too. Not just the moves,

1740
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:28,420
but also the,

1741
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:32,170
the amount of discipline that you have
to have to get your body into position to

1742
01:40:32,171 --> 01:40:36,130
play the game. I mean, you have to like
what you're talking about, what you did.

1743
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:36,790
I mean,

1744
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:40,810
there's not a lot of people that have
that kind of willpower to force themselves

1745
01:40:40,811 --> 01:40:43,930
to do those fucking crazy sprints,
to force themselves to do the shark tanks.

1746
01:40:43,931 --> 01:40:46,990
To force himself to train and when you
can barely walk and you feel like you

1747
01:40:46,991 --> 01:40:50,350
have a heart attack, not everybody has
that in them to push themselves that way.

1748
01:40:50,650 --> 01:40:52,660
So it's not just more,

1749
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:56,860
and it's variations in the attacks
and the counters and defense,

1750
01:40:57,190 --> 01:41:00,040
but it's also much more complex
mentally and emotionally.

1751
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:03,700
It requires more of you.
But I gotta imagine man,

1752
01:41:03,701 --> 01:41:08,320
that like when you put it all together,
like what was that feeling like?

1753
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:10,990
What was it feeling like when it
was over? Look, coiler didn't tap,

1754
01:41:10,991 --> 01:41:15,310
but you dominated that match.
There's just no doubt about it.

1755
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:18,850
And even more so in light of what
you're saying about how you want the,

1756
01:41:18,851 --> 01:41:19,900
the reversals,
which is,

1757
01:41:19,901 --> 01:41:22,600
are you adjusting and then you're
getting back to that position again.

1758
01:41:22,601 --> 01:41:27,130
That's how I roll. I mean, um,
it's just, it's incredible.

1759
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:31,540
It's amazing. What did it feel like?
What it feels like when it was all over

1760
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:35,680
before hoists? Gracie
got it. Got Mad at you.

1761
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:38,150
Yeah.
What did it feel like?

1762
01:41:38,151 --> 01:41:42,590
So mad at me and I don't know what he
thinks he were talking shit about his

1763
01:41:42,591 --> 01:41:44,930
family and about toilet.
Someone lied to him,

1764
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:48,230
someone lied to them because most
of them went up to hoists and told.

1765
01:41:48,231 --> 01:41:49,850
And I want to find out
who the hell that says.

1766
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:54,680
Someone told her voice that I talk shit
on the family and, and uh, you know,

1767
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:58,910
maybe he believes that he shouldn't
believe it, but he came up to me and uh,

1768
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:03,920
but before that you gotta I gotta read you
this really quick. Um, you know, let me,

1769
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:05,870
while you looking for it now that I found,

1770
01:42:05,871 --> 01:42:10,130
found him in my first book
and the Jujitsu unleashed,

1771
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:15,350
it came out in 2005. This was 2005,
two years after you tap toilet.

1772
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:18,830
This was how I opened this,
opened the book with,

1773
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:23,900
this is a very special thanks.
Goes out to the Gracie family though.

1774
01:42:23,901 --> 01:42:25,970
We have different views on the geek.

1775
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,590
I do appreciate tremendously what you
did for the world of martial arts and my

1776
01:42:30,591 --> 01:42:34,880
world. Thank you Heleo for being the
warrior, an innovator that you are,

1777
01:42:34,970 --> 01:42:37,160
who has tougher sons and you know,

1778
01:42:37,161 --> 01:42:42,161
one thank you Carlos senior for taking
in the Machados as sons of your own and

1779
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:46,460
introducing them to the fascinating
world of Jujitsu. Thank you.

1780
01:42:46,461 --> 01:42:49,190
Hoary on for producing the UFC.
Without you,

1781
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:54,350
the MMA industry would not exist and
I would still be deejaying in clubs.

1782
01:42:54,650 --> 01:42:59,330
Thank you [inaudible] for having the
courage to step up and fight and eight and

1783
01:42:59,331 --> 01:43:03,170
16 men tournaments just to prove
the effectiveness of Jujitsu.

1784
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:05,360
You will always be a legend.
Thank you.

1785
01:43:05,361 --> 01:43:08,690
Hixon for being the superman
of the Jujitsu world.

1786
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:11,360
There is no one I would rather
see in the ring than you.

1787
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:15,860
And thank you heuler for being you
without you and you're unbelievable

1788
01:43:15,861 --> 01:43:19,400
accomplishments and the grappling world.
This book would not exist.

1789
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:24,230
That was 2005 and after
Metamora Saturday night,

1790
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:28,010
I was emotional. I was crying. I just
went 20 minutes and they're just,

1791
01:43:28,430 --> 01:43:32,990
it was just, man, I can't tell
you. It was like I W I dunno man.

1792
01:43:33,230 --> 01:43:36,470
It was just glorious. And, um,

1793
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,970
I got on the Mike and I, what I
just read, I just said that again.

1794
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,770
I said the same thing again on the Mike.

1795
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:45,350
I just wanted to let everybody
know we all come from the Gracies.

1796
01:43:45,351 --> 01:43:47,780
We're all Gracie.
It's not 10th planet against the Gracies.

1797
01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:52,040
We're doing this for Jujitsu. The
10 planet thing is to Jujitsu. They

1798
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:54,080
don't want to hear that shit though
because people don't want to hear that

1799
01:43:54,081 --> 01:43:57,770
anybody is, you know, they, they'll,
they're idea is that no, you know,

1800
01:43:57,771 --> 01:43:59,240
we don't need your help.
You know,

1801
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:03,050
their idea is like we're doing this and
you're doing something different and

1802
01:44:03,051 --> 01:44:07,970
your stuffed slugs poke you.
And so then I get off stage,

1803
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:11,030
hugged my wife, hugged my mom. Um,

1804
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:15,610
I mean when I say they're saying
that like, you mean I'm being, um,

1805
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,740
they're not really saying that.
No one's really saying that,

1806
01:44:18,741 --> 01:44:23,090
but there's no one wants to hear that
you're, you know, they have pride.

1807
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:26,810
No one wants to hear that. You're like,
you're trying to fix Jujitsu, you know?

1808
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,520
Yeah.
That attitudes element,

1809
01:44:30,670 --> 01:44:34,010
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu community
that had a dead ignored me.

1810
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:37,730
Let's just say that they're just,
well, let's be honest though. I mean,

1811
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:42,970
it's kind of a tricky situation because
no one has more faith than you than I

1812
01:44:43,881 --> 01:44:48,350
do. No one, no one believes
just you're just a unique dude.

1813
01:44:48,351 --> 01:44:52,550
You can figure shit out. You have a
mind for games and you have a mind for,

1814
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:57,830
for strategy. I mean, you just, and you're
really ridiculously talented, new Jitsu,

1815
01:44:58,460 --> 01:45:02,300
creativity aside and all the other things
aside. But people who didn't know you,

1816
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:05,180
they saw this one match
and then after that match,

1817
01:45:05,181 --> 01:45:08,830
they saw you fight Leo
Vieira and Leo Vieira, um,

1818
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,300
basically dominated you on points.

1819
01:45:11,301 --> 01:45:15,740
You hurt your rib really early in
the match and a half way through.

1820
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,990
He would have still beat
me anyways. It was, it was,

1821
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:22,700
but what I was going to say is there was
after this incredible emotional fight

1822
01:45:22,701 --> 01:45:26,480
and you know, you beat a legend and
then you'd lost to another legend.

1823
01:45:26,481 --> 01:45:29,090
You got dominated by another legend.
So in their mind,

1824
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:30,410
they didn't take anything into account.

1825
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:32,930
They didn't take into account
what a crazy experience.

1826
01:45:32,930 --> 01:45:36,520
It must've been for some kid to be the
first American ever tap at Gracie and

1827
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:40,100
Jujitsu competition. I mean it was
bananas. The whole thing was bananas.

1828
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:43,730
You were crying. I was crying.
We were freaking out. And
then all of a sudden, boom,

1829
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:47,660
you got to fight again. Now you're
fighting Leo. Vieira it's like holy shit.

1830
01:45:47,661 --> 01:45:51,890
Like your whole thought process
was around fighting boiler Gracie.

1831
01:45:52,090 --> 01:45:53,570
Like I remember leading up to it.

1832
01:45:53,571 --> 01:45:56,990
You just kept talking about to boilers
in my division I might fight a boiler,

1833
01:45:57,020 --> 01:46:00,000
I might have to fight Beutler I mean all
the time. What you're training, Euler,

1834
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:02,270
Euler. That name kept coming
up over and over. No, no, no.

1835
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,460
So when it did happen and then boom,

1836
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:09,640
and you won much like you know when you
were throwing up on on Saturday night

1837
01:46:10,761 --> 01:46:15,270
after the event is over,
like this is gigantic dump and release it.

1838
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:19,370
So after all that, I went outside the
tent and I have this, the tough med.

1839
01:46:19,371 --> 01:46:22,940
They're my sponsors. They have this film
crew following me for this documentary.

1840
01:46:22,941 --> 01:46:27,530
They're putting together and they follow
me. I just needed a place to throw up.

1841
01:46:27,531 --> 01:46:29,270
I ran out of the place,
got on my knees.

1842
01:46:29,271 --> 01:46:33,860
It's just like throwing up and then I am
not the no comes from behind and pours

1843
01:46:33,861 --> 01:46:36,170
water on me. John Jocks,
everyone's following me.

1844
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,130
I thought it was funny
because I actually thought,

1845
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:47,090
anyways, I'm throwing up and then I
hear this voice behind me and said,

1846
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:50,250
uh, is good. You say that about my family,

1847
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:53,790
like and I wipe the
throw out from my mouth.

1848
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:55,650
I looked behind me and it's hoists Gracie.

1849
01:46:56,940 --> 01:47:01,940
And when someone says that to you that
that could be followed with a hug or a

1850
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:08,090
shake. Like it's good that you said that
about my family. Right, right, right.

1851
01:47:08,210 --> 01:47:10,410
Well good now. Right? Like what's Max?

1852
01:47:10,411 --> 01:47:14,160
Is it going to be a pound I had or
it could be something else like,

1853
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:19,370
because you were always talking shit
on my family before and I'm like, what?

1854
01:47:19,410 --> 01:47:21,330
I never, that's what he said. Yeah.

1855
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:25,770
He said it was like the craziest
backhanded compliment ever.

1856
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:30,360
He said it's good that you said that about
my family and I turned around and my,

1857
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:34,890
wow. How is Gracie man,
that's hoists Gracie.

1858
01:47:34,891 --> 01:47:38,580
That's like Mike Tyson. You know,
the first time you're meeting him?

1859
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:43,140
The first time ever
talking to him I think,

1860
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:46,800
but I've seen him in different places
and we've been in the same events and

1861
01:47:46,801 --> 01:47:50,400
stuff. And um, but um, he uh,

1862
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:52,950
he uh,

1863
01:47:54,210 --> 01:47:54,800
okay.

1864
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:55,633
Goes,

1865
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:59,030
it's good that you said that about my
family because you used to talk shit on my

1866
01:47:59,031 --> 01:48:01,880
family and I said, I ain't never talked
to you in your family. And my first book,

1867
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:04,870
I thank all of you, including you.
And I'm like kind of pointing out him,

1868
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:08,850
I'm a coil or Heleo.
I'm telling me somewhat,

1869
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:10,850
whenever someone told you about me,
they're lying.

1870
01:48:10,851 --> 01:48:15,230
I've never said it will only
a retard would talk shit
about the crazies in the G.

1871
01:48:15,450 --> 01:48:17,090
And that's in the Jujitsu business.

1872
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:19,820
You're in the Jujitsu business and you
have no respect for the Gracies, right.

1873
01:48:19,821 --> 01:48:24,470
What they've done. And now
just physically, what did
he say that, um, don't,

1874
01:48:24,770 --> 01:48:25,940
don't put your finger at me.

1875
01:48:25,941 --> 01:48:27,710
And then again on my face like
you want me to kick my ass?

1876
01:48:27,711 --> 01:48:32,360
And John Jock had to get between us to
like stop him from like getting in my

1877
01:48:32,361 --> 01:48:35,520
face cause he thought about now I'm
disrespecting him cause I'm like Kinda

1878
01:48:35,540 --> 01:48:39,560
pointing at him. You know he thought
I was, but look what he said.

1879
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:44,010
This is the craziest thing of all
liquid. He said, let me just quote on,

1880
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:46,620
okay.

1881
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:49,590
I don't know what fight he was watching.
I saw what he said.

1882
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:53,700
I'll paraphrase if you want it or not.
Try it here. I got it right here. He said,

1883
01:48:53,701 --> 01:48:58,680
uh, I wanted to talk to them for years
but never had the chance to meet him.

1884
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:00,360
Hoist,
hold MMA fighting.

1885
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:05,460
I met him after the fight and he was
there throwing up heuler dominate him,

1886
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:10,020
dominate him so much.
He did so much strength,

1887
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:12,240
but he threw up after the fight.

1888
01:49:16,290 --> 01:49:18,180
Right?
How crazy.

1889
01:49:18,330 --> 01:49:22,290
I told him that I liked what he said
after the fight but didn't like the fact

1890
01:49:22,291 --> 01:49:25,140
that he was always talking trash
about boiler and my family.

1891
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:28,020
He stood up and started yelling.

1892
01:49:28,410 --> 01:49:31,590
So I also raised the tone of my
voice and told them I didn't like it.

1893
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:35,970
He said he always gave my family credit,
but I know it's not true.

1894
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:40,020
He said he always kept my family credit,
but I know it's not true.

1895
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:41,460
He always seems,

1896
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,720
he always talks trash about my
family enough with this shit.

1897
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:49,870
He said he never talked bad about.
My family always gave us credit.

1898
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:52,630
He kept raising the tone of his voice.
I told him to shut up.

1899
01:49:52,810 --> 01:49:57,250
So as John Jacques Machado came in and
we didn't need this and ask Bravo to

1900
01:49:57,251 --> 01:50:00,610
leave. Wow. And then he goes, ah,

1901
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:04,390
Gracie said he would not compete
against Bravo in a grappling match,

1902
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:08,170
but seemed open to an MMA fight.
Can we slap each other?

1903
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:11,440
Can we beat each other up
or can we beat each other?

1904
01:50:11,650 --> 01:50:15,880
Gracie reply to laugh when asked if
he'd accept a fight and Metamorris I'm a

1905
01:50:15,881 --> 01:50:17,650
valid today.
Valerie Trudeau fighter.

1906
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:20,980
I'm not to score points
of fight with time limit.

1907
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:25,230
Let's fight with no time limit with
punches alive. I'm a valid tuto finer.

1908
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:26,950
I don't compete in grappling tournaments.

1909
01:50:27,710 --> 01:50:32,000
He's the only competed grappling wise.
See that one while ed smile fire, right?

1910
01:50:32,010 --> 01:50:35,440
Yeah. While they strangled him
while he put them to sleep.

1911
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:38,360
That was her after the
UFC. Yeah. So what do you,

1912
01:50:38,361 --> 01:50:42,600
I mean after all that stuff I Reggie
there was in my book and then here like

1913
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:45,850
someone's lions to most likely mean,
you know,

1914
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:49,070
people talk shit and people
want to be friends with him,

1915
01:50:49,071 --> 01:50:52,130
so they probably talk shit to him.
He's never talked to you before,

1916
01:50:52,131 --> 01:50:53,270
so he's never heard you say it.

1917
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:55,520
You definitely haven't said
it in an in print anywhere.

1918
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:58,160
He definitely never set an Nvidia
because I know you haven't said it.

1919
01:50:58,580 --> 01:51:01,760
You were always remarkably
composed about that. You know,

1920
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:04,480
you were always remarkably composed you,
the,

1921
01:51:04,481 --> 01:51:09,330
the worst you ever did was, um,
asked to do it again. You know,

1922
01:51:09,390 --> 01:51:12,050
that was a few years back.
You asked to do it again,

1923
01:51:12,230 --> 01:51:13,760
but you were never disrespectful about it.

1924
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:14,141
Yeah.

1925
01:51:14,141 --> 01:51:19,141
I thought most people in the late
nineties most small Jujitsu players in the

1926
01:51:20,350 --> 01:51:22,140
late nineties our dream
was to go against Heuler.

1927
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:26,050
He was the best for that was the pinnacle.
Imagine, not only is he the best,

1928
01:51:26,051 --> 01:51:30,880
but he's the son of Helio Gracie.
That's the, like the prints, you know,

1929
01:51:30,881 --> 01:51:34,840
at one 45. Damn, that was the
one that was the one 45. Hixon.

1930
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:39,820
So I got lucky enough to go
against them once and man,

1931
01:51:39,830 --> 01:51:41,830
I have a reason to do it twice.

1932
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:45,730
Whether it's like the proof that it was
wasn't a fluke or that it was a fluke,

1933
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:50,380
whatever. It was lucky whatever
you want to say. But I thought,

1934
01:51:50,381 --> 01:51:54,070
damn, I can make this happen. I
have a reason to make it happen.

1935
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:57,350
Do you want to keep doing this? Do
you want to keep competing now? I,

1936
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:02,080
if the money's right, but that's one thing
I don't even want to get into. Like, uh,

1937
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:06,800
the last thing I want to do is stress
about my next opponent or, or, uh, uh,

1938
01:52:06,810 --> 01:52:11,080
a trilogy with them, which
I'm not. I'll be open to it.

1939
01:52:11,081 --> 01:52:14,020
I just don't want to
talk and call people out.

1940
01:52:14,021 --> 01:52:16,270
And what are you going to do with
this and what he could do with that.

1941
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:19,510
I want no stress right now.
That's what I want.

1942
01:52:19,511 --> 01:52:24,400
I want to spend time with my family,
spend time with my students, have fun,

1943
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:27,080
enjoy my life right now.
I don't know,

1944
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:30,970
as soon as there's another opponent and
looming now I've got to study is I'm

1945
01:52:30,971 --> 01:52:34,240
thinking about, I don't want to think
about anything. I just want to have fun.

1946
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:34,660
I think

1947
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:37,480
metamorris has real
potential, man. I really do.

1948
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:38,980
I think there's something they could do.

1949
01:52:39,340 --> 01:52:42,790
I think there's something they can do
if they keep putting on these match ups

1950
01:52:42,791 --> 01:52:47,300
like this. You know, when people saw that
match between you guys Saturday night,

1951
01:52:47,330 --> 01:52:51,340
that was exciting as fuck. That was
really, really exciting. Yeah. You know,

1952
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:53,630
and if they have more matches like that,

1953
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:57,380
more a really good high
level exciting matches,

1954
01:52:57,381 --> 01:52:59,240
you get to see real
good technical Jujitsu.

1955
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:01,430
I think people start to really enjoy it.

1956
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:06,080
And the other thing about
Jujitsu as opposed to a MMA is,

1957
01:53:06,610 --> 01:53:08,720
um,
if it's especially Nogi,

1958
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:12,980
I see no reason why that can't
eventually be on television. You know,

1959
01:53:12,981 --> 01:53:17,010
when I look at like watching
Marcelo Garcia match or watch a, uh,

1960
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:22,290
jock ra was fighting it out with Dhabi
or in any of the really high level guys

1961
01:53:22,641 --> 01:53:25,850
that compete, not with Dobie, they're
fucking murderers. Vinny Magallanes.

1962
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:29,360
These guys are exciting to
watch, man. It's wild techniques.

1963
01:53:29,361 --> 01:53:33,170
Chrome Gracie pulls off, you know,
it's fun to watch him strangled.

1964
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:38,150
Especially submission only. No master Vic
Vic Dobby loud. She's Spanish. Joe Rogan.

1965
01:53:38,151 --> 01:53:40,430
I love that dude.
Me and him are actually,

1966
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:44,510
our first show is June 1st it's the going
to put on a grappling shit going to be

1967
01:53:44,511 --> 01:53:46,910
on Spanish TV. It's done. Oh Shit.

1968
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:52,130
It's called Eddie Bravo invitational and
it's going to be two 16 men submission

1969
01:53:52,131 --> 01:53:52,964
only tournaments.

1970
01:53:53,210 --> 01:53:58,210
One 45 same day weigh in one 70 same
day when and such as sensors for Spanish

1971
01:53:58,341 --> 01:54:01,970
television. We're going to focus
on white people and black people,

1972
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:05,960
but we're going to, the spotlight's
going to be on the Latin fighters and,

1973
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:07,220
and the two Latin fighters,

1974
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:10,670
the one we're going to that's already
in his Geo Martinez is one of my black

1975
01:54:10,671 --> 01:54:12,500
belts.
Amazing.

1976
01:54:12,710 --> 01:54:17,660
He's a breakdancer who just killing
people. He's going to do the one 45,

1977
01:54:17,661 --> 01:54:21,080
he's going to be the feature star and
he speaks Spanish and all that. And uh,

1978
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:25,740
his brother, Richie boogey man
Martinez, who's awesome. Awesome.

1979
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:30,560
He's a brown belt. He's doing MMA. He's
for Roche was talking about Spartan.

1980
01:54:30,710 --> 01:54:35,390
Both those guys are true. Spartans there.
They both have crazy dexterity to yes,

1981
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:39,050
they're super flexible. Break
Dancers, amazing at Jujitsu and uh,

1982
01:54:39,051 --> 01:54:42,950
they're tearing it up right now and
he's going to be the feature at the one

1983
01:54:42,951 --> 01:54:46,760
seven. It's going to be at the
Florentine Gardens Sunday, June 1st,

1984
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:51,020
and then the Florentine
Gardens in Hollywood. It's
Hollywood. Yeah. Yeah. Sunday,

1985
01:54:51,021 --> 01:54:55,880
June 1st Sunday. June 1st in
Hollywood. We're taping it for TV,

1986
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:59,540
so it's, um, uh, but
we're getting, you know,

1987
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:02,360
obviously we want to pack
the place too and afterwards,

1988
01:55:02,361 --> 01:55:05,270
as soon as we finish taping
those two 16 men brackets,

1989
01:55:05,271 --> 01:55:08,720
we're going to have 10 planet anniversary
party there too. It's a giant club.

1990
01:55:08,721 --> 01:55:11,570
It's, it's awesome. Um,
it's a, it's a big venue.

1991
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:16,490
So I'm home and where we have, um,
now it'd be awesome. And we have like,

1992
01:55:16,491 --> 01:55:20,060
schools competing against each other.
Like we got cold Breanna's best guy. Uh,

1993
01:55:20,210 --> 01:55:25,010
they say that gonna see, uh, that
they're going to give us their best guy.

1994
01:55:25,011 --> 01:55:26,660
They haven't confirmed anybody yet,

1995
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:29,920
but they've all agreed that they're
going to send their best guy, uh,

1996
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:35,090
Fabi these two over doom school. His
best guy. I'm Havi Vasquez, his best guy.

1997
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:38,510
Cabrina the Mendez brothers all,
you know,

1998
01:55:38,511 --> 01:55:43,511
we want the best guys submission only
16 man tournament with overtime rounds.

1999
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:47,460
Now let me ask you this. Yeah, that's
what I was going to ask you. What do you,

2000
01:55:47,461 --> 01:55:51,000
what happens in a situation
like, um, these, uh,

2001
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:55,590
th th th there everyone's
going for submission only,
but there's no submission.

2002
01:55:55,591 --> 01:55:59,250
So as a draw and fight to just clearly
aren't draws. Yeah. Like what do you do?

2003
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:03,280
How did you do to effect and Gracie
nationals and Gracie worlds? Um,

2004
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:06,990
if you're in a 16 man bracket,
if you're both disqualified.

2005
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:10,800
So the brackets ended up being
different, you know, after every,

2006
01:56:11,610 --> 01:56:16,610
after every a qualifier or that the
first bracket you see who makes it,

2007
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:19,530
there's going to be some guys
that both got eliminated.

2008
01:56:19,531 --> 01:56:21,690
So you have to restructure it.
It's a different,

2009
01:56:21,691 --> 01:56:25,260
but you can do it and it works great.
So if the guys, if you get to a draw,

2010
01:56:25,261 --> 01:56:28,470
both guys are eliminated. Both guys.
If it's the finals, it's no time limit.

2011
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:31,500
Oh my God. Yeah. So Gracie
nationals and Gracie world,

2012
01:56:31,650 --> 01:56:35,040
those are the most hard core.
That's the hardest tournament to win.

2013
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:39,060
The hardest turning all those,
all those great ideas. That's all.

2014
01:56:39,061 --> 01:56:41,220
It's all about submission.
But Ebi,

2015
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:43,530
which is what we're calling Eddie Bravo
invitation. We're going to have Ebi,

2016
01:56:43,531 --> 01:56:47,530
women, Ebi kids, Ebi, uh, um,

2017
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:52,770
Grand Prix. So who, who organized the
Gracie nationals is that Rose Rose crazy.

2018
01:56:52,820 --> 01:56:56,000
Yeah.
That's a brilliant way to handle it.

2019
01:56:56,910 --> 01:56:57,990
Those are the best tournament.

2020
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:03,020
And this year Gracie worlds is going
to be in Las Vegas at the Cox Pavilion.

2021
01:57:03,530 --> 01:57:06,990
It's blowing up dude. Submission
only is taken over. I mean,

2022
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:11,040
if you're a geneticist, when is
it? When is it a crazy world? Ooh,

2023
01:57:11,041 --> 01:57:15,370
it's like a September 21st or something.
Damn it.

2024
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:19,020
Go to Gracie tournaments.
Dotcom, Gracie tournaments.com.

2025
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:23,580
It's sometime in December, I think
it's the 20th and the 21st of December,

2026
01:57:23,730 --> 01:57:27,780
I'm pretty sure. Or September,
I'm sorry, of September in Vegas.

2027
01:57:27,781 --> 01:57:32,220
Gracie world's submission only. World's
dude submission only. World's, you know,

2028
01:57:32,490 --> 01:57:35,690
so we're doing the same thing though, but
we're not doing it. It's an invitation.

2029
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,380
We're going to pick 16 guys and 16 guys
on one side. 16 guys in the other side.

2030
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:44,610
Uh, also the other 10 plan
planet representative at
one 70 is going to be, uh,

2031
01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:48,360
Nathan Orchard who's one of my assassins.
He's a white guy, but you know,

2032
01:57:48,361 --> 01:57:51,870
we're accepting white guys too. He's
going to, he's going to be at one 72.

2033
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:54,750
So we're, we're taking
advantage of, uh, Vic doors,

2034
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:57,480
connections in the Spanish TV market,

2035
01:57:57,481 --> 01:58:01,950
which are Jorge's producing
this as well or has involved.

2036
01:58:02,070 --> 01:58:06,700
So, yeah, man. So we're just,
we're doing it man. And, uh,

2037
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:11,850
first we wanted to do it and do this
and give $100,000 to the winner just to

2038
01:58:11,851 --> 01:58:15,270
ensure if there's $100,000
prize and those guys,

2039
01:58:15,390 --> 01:58:19,260
what do we got to do to make sure these
matches are as exciting as possible?

2040
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:23,550
You got to make some serious
cash incentives. So that's
what we wanted to do.

2041
01:58:23,610 --> 01:58:26,520
We wanted the first one, we were planning
on doing this. We had some investors,

2042
01:58:26,521 --> 01:58:31,110
got a few of them. It's very hard for
people to invest on a first show, but uh,

2043
01:58:31,111 --> 01:58:33,120
so we decided to do the first one,
no money.

2044
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:35,460
We're just going to do it for
TV and just to get it going.

2045
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:37,200
And then hopefully we attract sponsors,

2046
01:58:37,201 --> 01:58:42,201
but ultimately it's for TV to make it
work for TV to ensure that guys don't

2047
01:58:43,571 --> 01:58:46,960
stall, that there's no reason to stall.
You don't have to have, you have to have,

2048
01:58:46,961 --> 01:58:49,120
um,
incentives,

2049
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:54,010
all these different incentives that
there's no reason for you to slow down,

2050
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:56,200
slowing down.
It's not helping you financially.

2051
01:58:56,350 --> 01:58:59,710
You on the training is going to be
different for these kind of tournaments.

2052
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:03,620
Instead of training for just get really
heavy on the passing and the sweeping

2053
01:59:03,621 --> 01:59:07,660
points tournaments, all you do is train,
sweeps and passes. That said submissions.

2054
01:59:07,661 --> 01:59:09,940
That's extra. You know, you
know, you're wasting your time.

2055
01:59:09,941 --> 01:59:13,300
Just you want to win a tournament
all your time, sweeping and passing.

2056
01:59:13,301 --> 01:59:15,640
That's how you win tournaments.
Because we want points. Yeah.

2057
01:59:15,670 --> 01:59:17,980
Cause that's what I want.
But if it's submission only tournament,

2058
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:19,540
you still work on your sweet been passing,

2059
01:59:19,541 --> 01:59:22,770
but you got to be heavy on the submission
setups because that's how you're going

2060
01:59:22,771 --> 01:59:26,590
to close the deal. That's how you're gonna
make your money. So that's the plan. UH,

2061
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:30,970
June 1st contact master
Vick at Eddie Bravo,

2062
01:59:30,971 --> 01:59:35,140
invitational.com. If, uh, you,
uh, you think you're a bad ass,

2063
01:59:35,141 --> 01:59:39,270
we want the best possible competitors,
the Beth, we'll pump it up before you.

2064
01:59:39,290 --> 01:59:42,560
Well, actually hold the event
when it's about to happen. Cool.

2065
01:59:42,590 --> 01:59:45,650
Have you in here again? Um,
what, what was I gonna ask? Um,

2066
01:59:46,460 --> 01:59:47,830
so this is what I'm going to.
And when you,

2067
01:59:47,831 --> 01:59:50,240
when you come off something like
Metamorris huge success, right?

2068
01:59:50,241 --> 01:59:53,300
I mean everybody was talking about all
over the, the mixed martial arts world,

2069
01:59:53,301 --> 01:59:56,300
Jujitsu world, the, I mean
it really made a big splash.

2070
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:59,820
Why not do another event on the Internet?
Why not do your own events?

2071
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:03,300
Exactly. Why fuck around with
the television show, you know,

2072
02:00:03,310 --> 02:00:07,180
cause metamorris there for pay per view
numbers. Everyone knows what good paper,

2073
02:00:07,181 --> 02:00:10,120
if few numbers off for the UFC and
let bad numbers and like the efficient

2074
02:00:10,121 --> 02:00:11,530
numbers come out and go,
oh shit,

2075
02:00:11,531 --> 02:00:14,950
you have c three had papapa
500 pay per views or whatever.

2076
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:20,280
And a 500,000 proof of a Jujitsu paper
view wasn't as an a big isn't huge digits

2077
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:25,870
is like underground. So if you get
like 5,000 paper views on Internet,

2078
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:27,070
that's pretty good.

2079
02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:31,480
So the biggest show metamorris day was
9,000 paper views and I was pretty,

2080
02:00:31,481 --> 02:00:35,920
I think it was the first one we're Haji
Gracie fought Shesha this one with all

2081
02:00:35,921 --> 02:00:38,800
the promotion you did and
the hype and all this shit.

2082
02:00:39,610 --> 02:00:42,880
I'm thinking if they did nine
k before there are at least 20,

2083
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:46,610
it could be even crazier than that.
This one could be 50. I don't know.

2084
02:00:46,611 --> 02:00:50,590
But you think about at least 20, right?
When did they know? I don't know.

2085
02:00:51,330 --> 02:00:54,040
No, I don't know. I don't know. Do
people, I don't know if they tell you,

2086
02:00:54,041 --> 02:00:57,700
I don't know how it gets out. Well, my
thought on it was that if I like 'em

2087
02:00:57,750 --> 02:01:02,340
RFA, which puts on some great
fights, you know, RFA, um, you know,

2088
02:01:02,341 --> 02:01:06,420
there's always some good matchups
um, you, you'd never hear about it.

2089
02:01:06,570 --> 02:01:09,300
Like an event goes by and you know,

2090
02:01:09,301 --> 02:01:13,260
you have to search the underground to
find results. It's not on the front page.

2091
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:15,900
But if you go to mixed martial arts.com,
boom,

2092
02:01:16,290 --> 02:01:17,970
mixed martial arts.com you hit news.

2093
02:01:17,971 --> 02:01:22,971
The very first picture is bravo dominates
Gracie and metamorris three and it's

2094
02:01:23,551 --> 02:01:25,350
your picture doing this.

2095
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:28,650
That never happens in a grappling match.

2096
02:01:28,651 --> 02:01:33,300
A grappling only match is the number
one thing on mixed martial arts.com.

2097
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:34,570
That's crazy.
That's crazy.

2098
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:37,780
Ariel Helwani had me on and he's all about
him and my doesn't even like Jujitsu.

2099
02:01:38,110 --> 02:01:41,360
And he said, he said, I don't even like
watching Jui Jitsu. I don't like it.

2100
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:46,130
But he said he was, he was thoroughly
entertained enough to want me on the show.

2101
02:01:46,131 --> 02:01:48,140
So I just,
I just did his earlier.

2102
02:01:48,350 --> 02:01:51,450
Why doesn't he like to just
some guys just like him, a man,

2103
02:01:52,850 --> 02:01:56,330
if a good paper view number
for Jujitsu is 9,000,

2104
02:01:56,510 --> 02:01:58,910
but for the UFC,
that'd be disastrous.

2105
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:04,120
There's a large percentage of the u s
or the UFC fan base that is not into Jiu

2106
02:02:04,460 --> 02:02:04,640
Jitsu.

2107
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:09,640
It would be interesting if it got to a
point where guys would not have to do MMA

2108
02:02:10,170 --> 02:02:13,590
to make real money. You know, like
there's a lot of guys like Jake shields,

2109
02:02:13,591 --> 02:02:16,140
a perfect example has an
amazing record in MMA,

2110
02:02:16,350 --> 02:02:20,220
but a lot of people don't
know Jake shields. Fucking
tremendous grapple. I mean,

2111
02:02:20,221 --> 02:02:21,230
a tremendous grasp.

2112
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:26,680
There's a video and this is
obviously a early and John Fitch,

2113
02:02:26,681 --> 02:02:28,680
his career, you know, John
Fitch is much better now,

2114
02:02:28,950 --> 02:02:31,370
but there's a video of Jake Shields,
uh,

2115
02:02:31,530 --> 02:02:36,150
competing in a tournament at Jujitsu
tournament with John Fitch and he fucking

2116
02:02:36,180 --> 02:02:39,870
sweep some, takes us back,
choke some and you're like, wow.

2117
02:02:39,871 --> 02:02:42,210
Like the way he does it hits
the butterflies, sweeps them.

2118
02:02:42,211 --> 02:02:46,290
It's like fucking Jake shields.
Jujitsu is solid. Fuck man.

2119
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:51,210
I would love to see a guy like that.
Like here it is right here. I mean,

2120
02:02:51,211 --> 02:02:56,211
he doesn't even necessarily have to
compete in MMA because the thing about it,

2121
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:59,010
uh, Jake shields, like
Jake shields is a, I mean,

2122
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:02,880
he's only lost three times
in the past fucking 10 years.

2123
02:03:03,150 --> 02:03:07,140
One of 'em was a, a knockout to
Ellenberger right after his dad died.

2124
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:11,070
The other one's a lost GSP.
And then the most recent one,

2125
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:13,200
he got dominated by Hector Lombard.

2126
02:03:13,290 --> 02:03:17,790
And you see him like compete with a guy
like Hector Lombard, especially in, uh,

2127
02:03:17,820 --> 02:03:22,680
in MMA. And you're like, my
God. Like, unless he catches
that guy in a submission,

2128
02:03:22,860 --> 02:03:24,210
look at that beautiful sweet.

2129
02:03:25,230 --> 02:03:27,690
He was working the Guillotine
and he hit that butterfly sweep.

2130
02:03:27,780 --> 02:03:31,200
But unless he catches a
guy in a submission, unless
he can get ahold of a guy,

2131
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:34,920
he's going to have a real hard time
beating a guy like Hector Lombard,

2132
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:37,890
like Lombard move.
So fucking fast man.

2133
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:39,790
Yeah.
The way to make it work for TV,

2134
02:03:39,791 --> 02:03:43,990
for all those millions and
millions of UFC fans that don't,

2135
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:45,650
that are bored by Jujitsu there,

2136
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:48,400
there obviously that's why there's
such a big difference in numbers.

2137
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:53,500
You got to get those fat. You got to make
Jujitsu entertaining enough for them.

2138
02:03:53,530 --> 02:03:57,080
They liked the UFC.
They will like submission,

2139
02:03:57,330 --> 02:04:01,070
a submission only Jujitsu.
I Nogi you can't have the gate.

2140
02:04:02,430 --> 02:04:06,040
The UFC fan base has not,
even though it's beautiful,

2141
02:04:06,730 --> 02:04:08,400
all the burn Bolo stuff and,
and,

2142
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:11,920
and tug of war on the pants when
they're playing tug of war on the pants.

2143
02:04:12,190 --> 02:04:17,140
That's a beautiful, complex,
sophisticated, amazing, uh,

2144
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:21,460
technique. But the people,
it's not good for TV, for TV.

2145
02:04:21,461 --> 02:04:24,270
It's just not good man. As
a TV producer that go, no,

2146
02:04:24,390 --> 02:04:27,830
well John John even said it and he's
like, you know, hey man, I love Jujitsu.

2147
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:30,870
And this ship puts me to sleep. Yeah.
It's, it's hard to watch sometimes.

2148
02:04:30,970 --> 02:04:33,910
Yeah. It's got, if it's going
to be for TV, if I'm, if,

2149
02:04:34,030 --> 02:04:39,030
if someone said we're going to give you
one season and you know a TV producer or

2150
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:43,530
a network head that doesn't give a shit
about tradition about you just they just

2151
02:04:43,531 --> 02:04:46,190
want fucking ratings for sure.

2152
02:04:46,191 --> 02:04:51,191
I would say it's not that we're not
going to have anything that that has that

2153
02:04:51,481 --> 02:04:53,850
can be described by using the word hold.

2154
02:04:53,851 --> 02:04:56,490
If there's any kind of hold in anything,

2155
02:04:56,491 --> 02:05:00,110
we don't want any of the grabbing and
yanking. Got To get rid of the geese.

2156
02:05:00,330 --> 02:05:03,930
It can't be a point system
it because think about this,

2157
02:05:04,290 --> 02:05:07,980
there's still a small percentage of the
people out there that prefer points over

2158
02:05:07,981 --> 02:05:12,210
submission only. It's crazy. Now you have
two matches, right? You have two matches.

2159
02:05:12,930 --> 02:05:16,590
Their both. Both matches have a
million dollar purse for the winner.

2160
02:05:16,650 --> 02:05:20,490
Whoever wins gets $1 million.
One is a points match.

2161
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:25,290
One is a submission only match. Both of
those matches. There's a minute left. The,

2162
02:05:25,291 --> 02:05:28,380
and the points match that the guy on top,
he just passed the guard,

2163
02:05:28,381 --> 02:05:33,180
he's up three nothing and there's a
minute left. If you were his coach,

2164
02:05:33,181 --> 02:05:34,920
the guy on top,
there's $1 million on,

2165
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:36,950
why would you tell them
to go for a submission?

2166
02:05:36,951 --> 02:05:40,140
Or would you tell them to hold Tom
Hall? Fuck yeah, I'd be screaming,

2167
02:05:40,141 --> 02:05:41,190
hold motherfucker.

2168
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:44,040
Especially if you were the coach
and you've got 15% of that shit,

2169
02:05:44,850 --> 02:05:45,970
you already spent that shit.

2170
02:05:46,870 --> 02:05:50,580
You already promised your wife a new
fucking Toyota that was your shit.

2171
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:53,160
You would say, oh, there's $1 million.

2172
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:57,790
Don't do as a submission would be the
last thing on your mind, right? His mind,

2173
02:05:57,820 --> 02:05:59,190
right.
It would be the dose.

2174
02:05:59,370 --> 02:06:03,570
But if it's a submission only
match that end of the match.

2175
02:06:03,570 --> 02:06:07,200
We look way different. They would both
be going nuts for that million dollars.

2176
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:10,960
It would look better for TV.
It'd be more exciting. Yeah.

2177
02:06:10,961 --> 02:06:13,130
So that ultimately better for Jujitsu?
Yes.

2178
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:18,010
So submission only is better for
Jujitsu. It's better for TV. You got to,

2179
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:21,390
you can't have tug of war. The
pants. It's a beautiful thing,

2180
02:06:21,391 --> 02:06:23,970
but it's going to be a niche thing.
It's always going to be underground.

2181
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:27,480
That will never be mainstream.
That what about a standard outfit?

2182
02:06:27,510 --> 02:06:31,440
Like you think that you know, I
know you like g pants, but what?

2183
02:06:31,510 --> 02:06:35,970
What about if it was only tights? Only? I
think you should do what Abu Dhabi does.

2184
02:06:35,971 --> 02:06:39,350
ADCC they figured it out.
You let them wear whatever they want.

2185
02:06:39,370 --> 02:06:40,650
They could wear a g if they want,

2186
02:06:40,890 --> 02:06:43,140
but when you're allowed
to wear whatever you want,

2187
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:46,470
if you could love the Geeky all
you want and worship the Geeky,

2188
02:06:46,471 --> 02:06:49,350
but you are not going to
wear it if you're allowed to,

2189
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:52,890
you're not going to give your opponent
something to grab onto. In pride,

2190
02:06:53,190 --> 02:06:55,620
they would allowed anybody to wear it,
but none,

2191
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:57,780
none of the Brazilian Jiu
Jitsu black belts wore their g.

2192
02:06:57,990 --> 02:07:00,630
None of them never allowed to.
They didn't want anybody to grab them.

2193
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:04,350
So what you do is no,
you let them wear whatever they want.

2194
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:06,180
Some people like wearing
tight booty shorts.

2195
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:07,920
Some people like wearing board shorts,

2196
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:11,460
some people like wearing tight
spandex shorts to go to the knees.

2197
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:14,700
Some guys like short rash guards,
some guys like long rash guards,

2198
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:17,190
some guys compete and Abu Dhabi
and they don't want any rash guard.

2199
02:07:17,191 --> 02:07:19,130
Well here's the deal though about
Abu Dhabi. If I would double,

2200
02:07:19,131 --> 02:07:22,460
if you're allowed to wear a gay,
are you allowed to grab the gay? Uh,

2201
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:27,810
apparently no course but you can't
grab pants. I was wearing shorts.

2202
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:31,560
You can't grab shorts? No, you can't
wear shorts. But it's a weird thing man.

2203
02:07:31,561 --> 02:07:35,920
Cause if I want to ski pants and he was
allowed to grab them, but uh, whatever,

2204
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:38,560
you know, it's all good. I like
all that controversy at the end.

2205
02:07:38,620 --> 02:07:43,390
I liked that the geek that making
me wear the guid backfired on them,

2206
02:07:43,510 --> 02:07:47,080
but it also saved them because it really
like all of those electric chairs,

2207
02:07:47,081 --> 02:07:50,860
that was all those g pants, man, that
[inaudible] pants or there was huge.

2208
02:07:50,861 --> 02:07:53,860
He could, he never got close of getting
out of my lock down. There was no,

2209
02:07:54,070 --> 02:07:58,180
he never even almost went to quarter
guard. That shit was locked in.

2210
02:07:58,510 --> 02:08:03,040
And the pants were a big deal. A big,
big part of it. That's interesting.

2211
02:08:03,190 --> 02:08:04,810
It's interesting to think of what would,

2212
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:09,340
how much different would the game be if
you had to wear tights? Yeah. Tights.

2213
02:08:09,370 --> 02:08:10,900
It would still be hard for
them to pull out his leg.

2214
02:08:10,990 --> 02:08:14,440
And even if I just wear board shorts
and knee sleeves, that'd be good enough.

2215
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:17,240
You know, um, the question of
what the at first find. Yeah.

2216
02:08:17,270 --> 02:08:20,170
The ankle sleeves are huge too.
You put pants, ankle sleeves,

2217
02:08:20,470 --> 02:08:22,680
or if you don't wear pants,
you could just wear knee sleeves.

2218
02:08:22,690 --> 02:08:24,610
And that's what I did in the first one.
That's why I had the knee sleeves.

2219
02:08:24,850 --> 02:08:27,010
Just you don't want,
uh,

2220
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:31,510
I mean somewhere I think in
everyone's mind they think that,

2221
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:36,220
uh, that it's not real grappling.
If it ain't all greasy,

2222
02:08:36,221 --> 02:08:37,870
it's gotta be greasy to be real.

2223
02:08:37,871 --> 02:08:42,430
And why you trying to stop all the grease
and you're supposed to swap sweat with

2224
02:08:42,431 --> 02:08:47,070
your opponent. You're so, you know,
it's like if you were, uh, um,

2225
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:49,210
pants, like, oh, you're cheating.

2226
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:53,350
Don't you want to be all slippery with
another man? It doesn't make any sense.

2227
02:08:53,351 --> 02:08:56,180
But I mean, don't the pants, you
said the pants aid you. Yeah,

2228
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:59,150
but he could grab them too.
So it was, it wasn't, uh,

2229
02:08:59,470 --> 02:09:02,430
he had an advantage that he can grab
them and it saved his ass again.

2230
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:07,960
And I had an advantage where with
my personal gain, my lockdown game,

2231
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:10,360
it helps it,
I wonder if listened to all this,

2232
02:09:10,361 --> 02:09:13,570
if they did decide to do a third one,
if he would say you got to wear shorts,

2233
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:17,070
dude, if I did a third one,
dude, the first rule is I get to,

2234
02:09:17,071 --> 02:09:19,270
well with the whatever
the fuck I want to wear,

2235
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:22,680
that's going to be rule number one.
I get to wear whatever the fuck.

2236
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:28,690
So that's the first
clause. It seems like, um,

2237
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:34,120
promoted correctly. There's obviously a
market for this now. Um, and like I said,

2238
02:09:34,121 --> 02:09:37,510
I, I, I, I'm committed to helping.
I definitely want to help.

2239
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:42,130
I think that something like this is
something that I get behind and you know

2240
02:09:42,131 --> 02:09:44,710
what I'm trying to do, dude, I'm
not trying to make money with Ebi.

2241
02:09:44,711 --> 02:09:49,660
I'm trying to create the best shit, just
like you're trying to create with on it.

2242
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:52,660
You're trying to do the best
shit. There's not like, Ooh,

2243
02:09:52,661 --> 02:09:55,360
there's a lot of money right here.
If I could manage it to show,

2244
02:09:55,570 --> 02:09:58,240
I'm trying to create the
best you just to show.

2245
02:09:58,390 --> 02:10:03,040
So I want everyone in the
Jiu Jitsu community to help
pitch in and help me out.

2246
02:10:03,041 --> 02:10:05,740
Help us out, help out.
Metamorris I'm starting Ubi,

2247
02:10:05,741 --> 02:10:10,120
but I still love them a more and more
metamorris and even though, uh, I'm, uh,

2248
02:10:10,121 --> 02:10:15,100
you know, I'm 100%. I'm not going
to be an m four. I still want to go.

2249
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:17,710
You say no. What I'm saying? Well
when is m four? I don't know,

2250
02:10:17,711 --> 02:10:20,920
but that ain't happening. It's
not happening. It's not happening.

2251
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:25,150
Taking some time off. Um, I'm
for sure going to take time off.

2252
02:10:25,151 --> 02:10:28,180
I don't even want to have, it's going to
do your own shit from here on out. Um,

2253
02:10:28,690 --> 02:10:30,700
I mean if you've got 20 k we saw,

2254
02:10:30,730 --> 02:10:35,730
we saw what could happen with m three
metamorris three we saw the potential to,

2255
02:10:37,660 --> 02:10:42,470
would you say 20? If they said 20 k paper
view that that's, that's a lot. I mean,

2256
02:10:42,471 --> 02:10:44,450
if we're just guessing. No,
I have no idea what it was.

2257
02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:48,590
That's a lot of money I've seen. That
seems like a lot of people to buy Jujitsu.

2258
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:52,010
I don't know though.
So I just,

2259
02:10:52,190 --> 02:10:54,170
I don't want it to really
think about it too much,

2260
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:57,710
but when I do decide to
sit down and talk numbers,

2261
02:10:57,890 --> 02:11:02,090
I mean I want to do what's best
for the security of my family.

2262
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:06,530
That's if I'm going to get back
into training camp, I'm going,

2263
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:07,371
you know,

2264
02:11:07,371 --> 02:11:12,371
and start seeing my son last and my wife
lasts and distress comes back and I'm

2265
02:11:13,191 --> 02:11:17,540
training all day and going through all
that and swimming and hating the swimming

2266
02:11:17,541 --> 02:11:21,920
and the torture. If I'm going to go
through that, I want what's coming to me.

2267
02:11:22,250 --> 02:11:25,040
That's it. I just want what's
fair. I want to be a dick about it,

2268
02:11:25,070 --> 02:11:29,230
but I'm not going to get taken advantage
of. So I hear what you're saying. Yeah.

2269
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:33,070
My man knows his value. Yeah. But I just,

2270
02:11:33,320 --> 02:11:35,170
I just want to enjoy life now.
And the,

2271
02:11:35,171 --> 02:11:40,171
the thing that feels the best about
this is like everybody who's gotten into

2272
02:11:42,681 --> 02:11:45,500
arguments with people
about the legitimate,

2273
02:11:45,650 --> 02:11:49,970
legitimate legitimacy of
the system and the style,

2274
02:11:50,150 --> 02:11:51,140
the 10 plan of stock,

2275
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:56,320
all the arguments that everyone's got
into with people in the haters and all

2276
02:11:56,541 --> 02:11:57,374
that stuff,

2277
02:11:57,710 --> 02:12:02,710
I think about how vindicated they feel
and how I gave them a little boom.

2278
02:12:03,681 --> 02:12:05,000
I could help them personally.

2279
02:12:05,001 --> 02:12:09,170
And their argument now when they argue
with those same guys are like, ah,

2280
02:12:09,350 --> 02:12:14,120
like the little I gave him, like I put
in, oh, that feels really, really done.

2281
02:12:14,510 --> 02:12:19,340
That things are all really good. A
little dig. Yeah, man. I, you know,

2282
02:12:19,341 --> 02:12:24,140
the argument, you know, and,
and again, all I ever try to
do is make Jujitsu better.

2283
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:28,110
And the people that are resisting me,
and uh,

2284
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:33,950
there's so many people on the
Internet who aren't Aquest to,

2285
02:12:34,070 --> 02:12:35,540
who are Jujitsu freaks,

2286
02:12:35,660 --> 02:12:40,660
who are on a quest to shut me down and
they hope the rubber guard fails and the

2287
02:12:41,001 --> 02:12:46,001
system fails and it's a fraud and they're
on a mission and they're generally on.

2288
02:12:47,031 --> 02:12:51,290
Um, there's, I have on the Uttama
Forum, I do frequent the Uttama form.

2289
02:12:51,291 --> 02:12:54,520
It's the Geeky form, probably
the biggest key for him, uh,

2290
02:12:54,530 --> 02:12:59,330
in the world on a mixed martial arts.com
if you go in the tunnel form and I

2291
02:12:59,331 --> 02:13:02,240
would say 75% of the people on there,

2292
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:04,940
they are generally not fans of mine.

2293
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:08,330
So I'm like in there like swimming
with the sharks all the time, man.

2294
02:13:08,510 --> 02:13:12,890
I'll respond to shit and I read their
shit and there's guys that are just can't

2295
02:13:12,891 --> 02:13:17,000
wait for something to happen bad at
10 plan and jump on it. They just

2296
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:21,890
always going to be haters out there.
That shit is such a waste of energy.

2297
02:13:21,891 --> 02:13:25,610
But the crazy thing is I know all these
guys in the fake screen names and who

2298
02:13:25,611 --> 02:13:28,460
knows what they look like and I know
who they are. It's like the same guys.

2299
02:13:28,461 --> 02:13:33,460
And when I, after the fight
I uh, went to my hotel,

2300
02:13:33,490 --> 02:13:36,690
took a shower and I'm just like sitting
there for like five minutes and I looked

2301
02:13:36,691 --> 02:13:38,760
on the underground and I
couldn't believe the headline.

2302
02:13:38,910 --> 02:13:42,630
It was like a one to a one two
punch man who was killed me first.

2303
02:13:42,631 --> 02:13:47,631
I looked at the headline and it said
Bravo dominates Gracie and Metamorris am I

2304
02:13:47,731 --> 02:13:48,720
want the fucking,

2305
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:53,430
it's like the ultimate review
ever front page of my that's,

2306
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:57,390
that's, that's like my home base
man. The underground Kerrick.

2307
02:13:57,391 --> 02:14:00,300
I fucking love Kendrick man and Chris,
Matt.

2308
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:06,000
It was crazy. And then I
immediately, I didn't even read,

2309
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:07,890
I didn't even get on the underground.

2310
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:12,300
I went to the Uttama form and
I wanted to see what they said.

2311
02:14:12,780 --> 02:14:17,190
And Man, a Breton, the towel check
your oil. That's his screen name.

2312
02:14:17,610 --> 02:14:21,440
He's always on there. He's like that.
He keeps the peace. He's like the,

2313
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:25,500
the go between because he also transit
Gracie Baha is like that. The peacemaker,

2314
02:14:26,390 --> 02:14:29,490
cause he won't let anybody trashed term
planet cause he's one of my black belts,

2315
02:14:29,491 --> 02:14:32,730
but he's also training in the Geetu
wants to get a ski black belt.

2316
02:14:32,731 --> 02:14:36,810
So he's the enforcer there.
So he starts a thread. Fluke.

2317
02:14:36,811 --> 02:14:39,840
My Ass said fluke my ass.
I was a threat.

2318
02:14:39,990 --> 02:14:44,820
So I got on to get all them dudes
that fucking couldn't stand me.

2319
02:14:45,510 --> 02:14:48,450
Not usually when something
good happens at 10 planet,

2320
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:51,360
they just stay off the threat and
they're silent and they're just,

2321
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:54,180
they don't even want to bump the
threat up. They just want to let it go.

2322
02:14:54,181 --> 02:14:56,010
Just let it go. Let it
go. Let that video go.

2323
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:59,490
Nice little highlight reel of us
dominating like the Gracie nationals,

2324
02:14:59,610 --> 02:15:02,100
they let that go. No response.
Let it go. Let it go. Let it go.

2325
02:15:02,370 --> 02:15:03,300
Because they know if they hate,

2326
02:15:03,330 --> 02:15:06,780
it's going to backfire because now more
people going to say it. So, but this one,

2327
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:10,770
they all responded. They gave it up and
it was so crazy. Dude, I'm sitting there,

2328
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:15,800
I'll fucking be looking at fucking tears
rolling down my fucking face from that

2329
02:15:15,871 --> 02:15:19,270
shit. Like that is the best
compliment Adler ever when guys did.

2330
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:23,760
We're on a mission when guys that were
on a mission every day to follow me

2331
02:15:23,761 --> 02:15:24,300
around,

2332
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:29,300
fucking just shank me on the side and to
have those guys admit that we're wrong.

2333
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:36,330
Um, man, I dunno man. That
was, there was a combination,

2334
02:15:36,331 --> 02:15:39,630
that front page and
then it was incredible.

2335
02:15:40,040 --> 02:15:43,360
Don't want to be haters and they, they,
they become haters and then it sort,

2336
02:15:43,361 --> 02:15:46,400
it sort of gets away from them, you
know, they just, they almost can't help.

2337
02:15:46,401 --> 02:15:48,170
It just gets out of control.

2338
02:15:48,730 --> 02:15:49,563
Joey,

2339
02:15:50,890 --> 02:15:54,910
Joey Diaz cold. Yeah, but damn you got
18 and I'm going to work in here. Yeah.

2340
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,830
Hung Up. Shit. T and t
doesn't work in here.

2341
02:15:57,430 --> 02:16:01,450
Yeah, but a column call it called
Joe wrote Joey really quick.

2342
02:16:01,451 --> 02:16:04,120
I think he knows I'm on the podcast.
He probably wants to say something.

2343
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:07,780
It's probably hard as fuck right now.
Joe Rogan, what is he going to say?

2344
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:09,520
Pr Predict. Uh, what he would say.

2345
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:13,830
Eddie Bravo. I told you I told you
cock saga. Electric Chair all day

2346
02:16:18,690 --> 02:16:19,840
you have reached the voice.

2347
02:16:20,120 --> 02:16:24,920
Oh, something might have happened. I might
of got pulled into a meeting. Joey Diaz,

2348
02:16:24,921 --> 02:16:28,700
his Bolo on the fuck up. Oh Dude.
He's selling out everywhere.

2349
02:16:28,701 --> 02:16:33,130
He's getting brought in from meetings
and fucking people want them to do movies

2350
02:16:33,131 --> 02:16:34,360
and it's just,
it's incredible.

2351
02:16:34,370 --> 02:16:35,330
Well, it's incredible. So yeah.

2352
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:42,440
Yeah, he's a, okay. I might've went over
the four oh five or something. This is it.

2353
02:16:44,030 --> 02:16:48,770
I have to ask you this. Did the, did
the Indian come out the after party? No.

2354
02:16:48,950 --> 02:16:53,040
No, I don't feel it. I don't know. It was
like, no, probably so tired. Right? Yeah.

2355
02:16:53,670 --> 02:16:55,550
Yeah.
I just didn't feel it Joey.

2356
02:16:55,810 --> 02:16:56,190
Okay.

2357
02:16:56,190 --> 02:16:58,440
Oh, it's ringing. Check this out.

2358
02:16:59,470 --> 02:17:00,570
I think it's gonna work.
Yeah,

2359
02:17:03,450 --> 02:17:05,890
but I'm not sure if he's going to answer.

2360
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:09,760
Feels good to be a gangster.

2361
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:13,630
You're on the radio. Tell him, tell him
you love that you're live on the podcast.

2362
02:17:14,350 --> 02:17:17,710
I'm telling you right now, dawg.
Damn. It feels good to be a gay.

2363
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:19,980
Same wouldn't be any problem.

2364
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:23,380
No.

2365
02:17:23,380 --> 02:17:28,100
14 you got child's black fucking man.

2366
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:36,530
The fucking doors over there
and vote when the child. Ah,

2367
02:17:40,690 --> 02:17:42,100
that's all I love to say.
I love you.

2368
02:17:42,750 --> 02:17:45,660
Hello you man. We love
you too, man. Thank you.

2369
02:17:47,290 --> 02:17:50,310
He came in and just dropped a bomb
right there. He's the greatest.

2370
02:17:50,460 --> 02:17:54,070
Joey Diaz greatest. So, um,

2371
02:17:54,090 --> 02:17:58,030
what's next on the music front? I mean,
it a hilarious thing. You know, you're,

2372
02:17:58,390 --> 02:18:00,960
you're a Jujitsu master,
but your music,

2373
02:18:00,961 --> 02:18:04,410
is it just as important to you
is your Jujitsu? Yeah, no. Yeah,

2374
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:07,290
and I believe just as good.
What's going on with the music?

2375
02:18:07,291 --> 02:18:09,750
What are you doing it I just
dropped. Did I just, we just redid,

2376
02:18:09,751 --> 02:18:13,730
dropped me and Danny loan or x nine
inch nails x perfect circle we read.

2377
02:18:13,731 --> 02:18:18,690
Did drop dude. And I think it's
the best work I've ever done.

2378
02:18:18,750 --> 02:18:20,220
Let's play can we couldn't play?

2379
02:18:20,221 --> 02:18:25,221
I just go to
soundcloud.com/eddie-bravo dude,

2380

2384
02:18:40,201 --> 02:18:44,880
Is headquarters going to be like

2385
02:18:45,060 --> 02:18:48,600
I wish I was training again.
Everything I did in that match.

2386
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:52,230
That's old school shit that I always do.
It's all on mastering the system.

2387
02:18:52,231 --> 02:18:55,740
It's all on my website. It's only five
bucks right now. You could let me fill me.

2388
02:18:56,130 --> 02:18:58,140
Come to class tonight.
I don't know.

2389
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:00,120
You better get them in the film
when you come to class at night.

2390
02:19:00,180 --> 02:19:02,810
Are you fucking kidding me? Are
you fucking kidding me? Yeah,

2391
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:05,940
you fucking kidding me. This
is the class. After that,

2392
02:19:05,941 --> 02:19:09,870
that place is going to be mobbed, bro.
I was going to be fucking bananas.

2393
02:19:10,170 --> 02:19:13,170
I might even come down, man.
I'm still sore as fuck though.

2394
02:19:13,171 --> 02:19:15,660
I'm getting another Regena
keen on my back next week.

2395
02:19:16,410 --> 02:19:19,530
My neck is 100% now.
What does that Ricky rocket

2396
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:27,060
make sure he knows he's live a Ricky,
you're live on Joe Rogan's podcast,

2397
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:28,050
so don't say a

2398
02:19:28,050 --> 02:19:28,940
any crazy shit.

2399
02:19:32,860 --> 02:19:37,330
One thing I do want to stay as the reason
I called because I was trained in this

2400
02:19:37,330 --> 02:19:42,230
morning over in the nod and I heard about
all this stuff with boys and I'm just,

2401
02:19:42,610 --> 02:19:43,630
I don't understand.

2402
02:19:43,631 --> 02:19:48,631
I'm so upset about it and I saw you being
nothing but a fricking class half the

2403
02:19:48,910 --> 02:19:49,680
other night.

2404
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:52,290
Thank you man. Someone must have lied
to him. That's all. It's someone.

2405
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:55,140
Someone's been lying to them and we
need to get to the bottom of that.

2406
02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:56,840
Yeah,

2407
02:19:56,840 --> 02:20:00,350
I don't, I've never heard you say
anything with cool stuff about boys, man.

2408
02:20:00,370 --> 02:20:05,370
You used to talk about him back in the
day about how amazing it was that you

2409
02:20:05,891 --> 02:20:09,860
came to the United States and did what
he did. And that has with so many people,

2410
02:20:09,861 --> 02:20:11,770
it changed the course of martial arts,

2411
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:15,300
you know?

2412
02:20:15,300 --> 02:20:19,620
Yeah. Those are facts. Someone lied to
him. The only thing that makes sense,

2413
02:20:19,621 --> 02:20:20,490
someone had a lie to them.

2414
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:24,970
Yeah, man, I can't believe I wish
I would've been able to stay.

2415
02:20:24,971 --> 02:20:29,770
I had to get home to my kids, but if I
would have been there, man, God, you know,

2416
02:20:31,180 --> 02:20:32,230
I could do on my end.

2417
02:20:32,231 --> 02:20:35,230
I have no idea what my influence
would you probably nothing.

2418
02:20:35,231 --> 02:20:39,190
But if it is just you just
ask me, I'll do it, you know?

2419
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:42,030
Thank you man. How about the
playing drums on one of my tracks?

2420
02:20:42,031 --> 02:20:43,150
How about that as I call?

2421
02:20:43,660 --> 02:20:44,030
Okay.

2422
02:20:44,030 --> 02:20:44,863
Yeah.
Okay.

2423
02:20:47,790 --> 02:20:52,500
No, stop with the twirling of the
sticks. Please. Can you, can you,

2424
02:20:53,510 --> 02:20:56,640
can you play one of my songs
about twirling any goddamn stacks?

2425
02:20:57,460 --> 02:20:58,293
I don't know.

2426
02:21:01,790 --> 02:21:05,790
Hey, but you know what Ricky,
Ricky, I swear to God, man, I,

2427
02:21:06,010 --> 02:21:09,310
one of my good friends is Danny
loaner from nine inch nails. He knows,

2428
02:21:09,610 --> 02:21:12,550
I mean he's, he's, he's
deep, deep, deep, deep.

2429
02:21:12,880 --> 02:21:17,440
And I don't know how many times I've, uh,
always stuck up for Ricky rocket. I go,

2430
02:21:17,441 --> 02:21:18,880
dude,
that mother,

2431
02:21:18,940 --> 02:21:22,990
the shit you do as a showman with the
twirling of the sticks and all that shit,

2432
02:21:23,260 --> 02:21:27,760
that's amazing, man. I can't
do any of that shit. That's
talent. Some people think,

2433
02:21:27,761 --> 02:21:32,230
oh, it's just, it's all tricks and smokes
and mirrors, you know? But I really,

2434
02:21:32,231 --> 02:21:34,650
really respect your showman,
shipping your drama.

2435
02:21:34,651 --> 02:21:37,480
And I think it's fucking amazing,
man. Like Cirque du Solei drumming.

2436
02:21:37,481 --> 02:21:40,840
So I always had your back. I always
had your back. You know that.

2437
02:21:45,070 --> 02:21:46,930
Thank you Ricky. Take it easy, Ricky.

2438
02:21:49,050 --> 02:21:53,480
No problem at all. I have
no idea. Oh Hey, by the way.

2439
02:21:53,780 --> 02:21:56,360
Okay. He's, he's hearing you. He
hears everything I say or you,

2440
02:21:56,361 --> 02:21:57,350
you just can't hear me

2441
02:21:58,950 --> 02:22:00,290
the other night.

2442
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:01,600
Great seeing you too,
man.

2443
02:22:03,330 --> 02:22:04,163
Yup.

2444
02:22:08,350 --> 02:22:11,170
That's what he was asking me.
This dude. How good is Joe Rogan?

2445
02:22:11,171 --> 02:22:15,200
He looks like a fucking destroyer.
I bet he can destroy people. Mike,

2446
02:22:15,220 --> 02:22:17,650
have you seen him kick
the fucking bag on video?

2447
02:22:17,860 --> 02:22:20,380
It doesn't have like 10
million views or something.

2448
02:22:20,630 --> 02:22:23,380
I don't think it to take care of Ricky

2449
02:22:25,110 --> 02:22:28,200
ass in person. You can also
kick out verbally too. I mean,

2450
02:22:28,201 --> 02:22:30,720
it's like a fucking
these guns in Jiu Jitsu.

2451
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:42,830
This is a beautiful podcast. Rikki rocket
by the way. He's a bad motherfucker.

2452
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:46,090
What'd you rock it from? Poison
is legit. Legit black belt

2453
02:22:51,420 --> 02:22:56,100
martial arts his whole life, his whole
life. And a great guy. Super Cool.

2454
02:22:56,310 --> 02:22:58,270
And he's competed as a black belt.
He did the,

2455
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:03,190
the world's or Pan Am's and big Ibj judge
tournament as a blackbody competed in

2456
02:23:03,191 --> 02:23:07,590
others. He's told you totally legit.
And it, like I said, a great guy.

2457
02:23:07,591 --> 02:23:09,290
Just a cool guy.
Um,

2458
02:23:09,330 --> 02:23:12,480
let's just wrap it up with our sponsors
and play that song and get the fuck

2459
02:23:12,481 --> 02:23:14,040
Outta here.
This is a beautiful podcast.

2460
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:18,120
This podcast is the most people
ever on speakerphone, ever.

2461
02:23:19,470 --> 02:23:22,490
We've ever had that many,
three different people on speaker phones.

2462
02:23:22,491 --> 02:23:26,720
That's craziness. It's crazy, man. But it
was beautiful. Congratulations brother.

2463
02:23:26,730 --> 02:23:27,840
It was an honor to be there.

2464
02:23:28,490 --> 02:23:32,240
I got choked up when people were telling
me how nuts you were going. That made,

2465
02:23:32,310 --> 02:23:35,850
I gave me the chills like, go do. Jo
was losing his mind and I was just like,

2466
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:39,630
fuck man. Just knowing that, you know,
Brian Count can't shut the fuck up.

2467
02:23:39,690 --> 02:23:42,150
He never shut the fuck up.
And by the time we got to fuck with Cha,

2468
02:23:42,210 --> 02:23:46,320
I still wasn't breathing right.
Wow. Like my hands were shaking,

2469
02:23:46,321 --> 02:23:48,620
my heart was beating and Brian's
is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2470
02:23:48,650 --> 02:23:51,000
Then I said this and this and I
was like, I thought guys, you know,

2471
02:23:51,001 --> 02:23:53,490
he's like doing all this shit and
I'm, and I'm, I'm like, Brian,

2472
02:23:53,491 --> 02:23:56,130
I didn't even know what you just said.
Half an hour.

2473
02:23:56,131 --> 02:23:59,040
I haven't listened to a fucking word
cause he was, you know Brian Callan.

2474
02:23:59,220 --> 02:24:02,100
When you know how,
like we've talked about this before,

2475
02:24:02,220 --> 02:24:06,330
it's like when you're not thinking about
nothing, you're background defaults.

2476
02:24:06,630 --> 02:24:09,390
Did you get to start thinking about
Jujitsu when you're sitting around and you

2477
02:24:09,391 --> 02:24:10,980
start going over move when you,
you know,

2478
02:24:10,981 --> 02:24:13,590
you got 10 minutes before you have to be
somewhere and you're just sitting there

2479
02:24:13,591 --> 02:24:15,510
and there's nothing going on
and you start thinking, man,

2480
02:24:15,930 --> 02:24:18,990
I got to figure out a better
counter to start going over there.

2481
02:24:19,140 --> 02:24:21,960
That's default for Brian Cowen.
When you stopped talking,

2482
02:24:22,110 --> 02:24:26,770
he defaults to gay jokes. He defaults to
him talking about fucking guys, you know.

2483
02:24:26,790 --> 02:24:29,520
And I told them, look, I
fuck guys. And he's like,

2484
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:34,230
and I remember looking over in the
middle of him say like doing his shtick.

2485
02:24:34,530 --> 02:24:36,360
And I was like, dude, I don't
know what the fuck you just said.

2486
02:24:36,361 --> 02:24:37,590
I literally haven't even heard you.

2487
02:24:37,591 --> 02:24:41,130
All I've been doing is trying to catch
my breath. I almost had a heart attack,

2488
02:24:41,131 --> 02:24:42,840
dude.
I wrote that on Instagram.

2489
02:24:42,990 --> 02:24:46,770
And it sounds like you know something
somebody would say, but God damn,

2490
02:24:46,771 --> 02:24:51,510
my heart was pounding. It was crazy.
I just want you to catch a man,

2491
02:24:52,650 --> 02:24:55,170
dude. When you, when you
went to the truck, when you,

2492
02:24:55,171 --> 02:24:57,540
when you rolled that left
shoulder roll the twister row,

2493
02:24:57,541 --> 02:25:00,630
which is my favorite move,
but the other side,

2494
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:06,450
it's not a role that you do that left
roll when I knew you were going there,

2495
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:08,790
I was hoping you were going
to hit the twister. Oh,

2496
02:25:08,791 --> 02:25:11,850
I was hoping you're going to
adjust and go for the twister. No.

2497
02:25:12,220 --> 02:25:15,060
What the fuck was going on?
Like Jeff Glover in the commentaries.

2498
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:19,830
Like I like to think of myself as a guy
as well versed in Jujitsu and I don't

2499
02:25:19,831 --> 02:25:24,670
even know what's going. This is crazy.
That's why it's so hard to defend.

2500
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:27,970
You know there was not Natto Magno was uh,
tell them you don't want any game.

2501
02:25:27,971 --> 02:25:30,790
You just, no, no. Eddie game. You go
get tap. You don't know Eddie's game.

2502
02:25:30,791 --> 02:25:33,010
You're going to get that.
It's funny.

2503
02:25:33,011 --> 02:25:36,280
But boiler to his credit would not
top and he's a bad motherfucker.

2504
02:25:36,281 --> 02:25:38,590
You got to give him that man.
That guy's got heart. Yeah.

2505
02:25:38,690 --> 02:25:41,740
Cause I know there's a photo of us online,

2506
02:25:41,741 --> 02:25:45,430
the high time shoot where you got me
in the vaporizer. Just that picture,

2507
02:25:45,431 --> 02:25:48,400
like that's a real agony.
Look on my face. I'm like, ah,

2508
02:25:48,580 --> 02:25:50,190
and you're not even pulling on it.
Yeah.

2509
02:25:50,290 --> 02:25:53,650
I couldn't imagine the way you were
yanking it with two hands and Heuler just

2510
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:56,230
let it go.
He just let it get all chewed up.

2511
02:25:56,300 --> 02:26:01,220
Yeah, I'd never gone that
deep with the vaporizer.

2512
02:26:01,221 --> 02:26:04,220
Ever. People tap right the fuck
away. That's the worst one.

2513
02:26:04,500 --> 02:26:07,550
He's a bad motherfucker. He
hung in there, man. So yeah,

2514
