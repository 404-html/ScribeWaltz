1
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,480
No headphones.
I'd rather not have that gene.

2
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:10,810
Grazie no,
because I learned that,

3
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:14,110
I learned that the hearing my own voice
in my head makes,

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,830
makes me focus on it and I don't want to
focus on the sound of my voice.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,290
I want to focus on your thoughts.
I'm focusing on,

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,300
Ooh,
it's like blowing out in my head and all

7
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:24,040
this shit's going on.
That's smart.

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:27,740
What's up?
Oh,

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,580
we're talking about whether or not you
should have headphones on or not have

10
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:33,650
headphones on.
Don't are we up?

11
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,160
No.
If you're hearing the audio recording in

12
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:40,070
this,
what's happening is we switched to a new

13
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:42,680
tri caster.
We were having problems with our old one

14
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:47,480
to tri caster is the machine that allows
Jamie to switch cameras and put

15
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:52,190
everything up on the Internet and
hopefully includes skype so we could get

16
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:54,740
some people from like getting signal,
but there's no video showing.

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,740
Hmm.
Are we going to restart?

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,590
I don't know.
I'm trying to make sure that that's

19
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:01,700
actually true.
Sorry.

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,970
It's okay.
Uh,

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,260
we might have to restart.
Folks would try and live while we're

22
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:08,910
going live with some new shit.
But I want it.

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,650
I want people on Youtube.
Is it audio?

24
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:14,820
But no video.
I don't know why I figured that out.

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,920
Ladies.
Gentlemen,

26
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:17,720
if you are just staring at a blank
screen,

27
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,380
would you have to shut this?
Showed down to get the video back to it

28
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,670
should work,
but all right,

29
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:25,550
just do a double camera.
A two shot.

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,070
So you're never going to be okay now.
Is it live now?

31
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,630
Tech motherfucking,
they would suck.

32
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,300
It would suck if like we did back in
half an hour.

33
00:01:35,301 --> 00:01:38,680
It turns out none of it got picked up or
we did a whole shore.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,750
Camera's going on youtube right now for
sure.

35
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:43,490
It just,
they don't see us right now.

36
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:48,220
He's trying to fix that
motherfucking dollar.

37
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,290
Gee,
we were having problems with our old tri

38
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,140
caster crashing a lot.
So we've got a new tri caster,

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,770
but it turns out that,
what is it that doesn't match up?

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,470
What part is wrong?
The control panel.

41
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,160
It should be okay.
Hey everybody.

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,480
Oh Shit.
Oh Shit.

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,300
Um,
what were we just talking about?

44
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,550
We're talking about material,
headphones,

45
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,600
headphones.
Oh,

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,100
listening to yourself and the
headphones.

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,000
What I think of is though,
it makes me like I close out the outside

48
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:17,810
world.
Totally.

49
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,640
And I just lock in on the conversation.
Yeah,

50
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,230
it's only psychological.

51
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,720
But if you will watch,
if he puts up a video,

52
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:26,000
it'd be nice to hear it and then you
brought your head and you have to put

53
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:29,180
the headphones on.
I just feel like when that's on,

54
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,320
it's just like I pay more attention to
not talking over people too.

55
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,870
Can't stand the sound of my voice.
So hearing you,

56
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,730
thank you.
Thank you.

57
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:41,240
But I can't stand the sound of it and I,
I hear enough.

58
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,680
I don't need it blasting in my ears as I
talked.

59
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:46,690
Then I focus on it and then I think
that's a good get depressed.

60
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,170
It's a good quality to,
he hate your own voice because voice,

61
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,050
he would listen to it all the time like,
Ooh,

62
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,040
you know how hard it is to listen to my
standup.

63
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,250
That's tyree hard for everybody.
It's death.

64
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,440
It kills me.
But I,

65
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,130
but I always

66
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,170
hear your voice.
You've got to listen to your shit.

67
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:04,660
You got to go back and edit,
you got to edit your shit.

68
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:06,730
And I'm like,
I don't want to listen to my self.

69
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,440
I just,
I want to put every,

70
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,020
uh,
every time I go up on stage behind me,

71
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:13,270
I don't want to go back.
But I know that's not the right thing to

72
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:13,841
do.
You,

73
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:16,510
you get a,
you take a lot of time out of the

74
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:21,160
development of a joke process if you
just listened to the previous versions

75
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:22,930
of it.
Cause like I have this new bit that I'm

76
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,800
doing right now.
Um,

77
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,170
and I have like three different versions
of it and it's not right now.

78
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:31,300
It's very shaky.
It's very shaky.

79
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:32,580
It goes one way,
it goes the other way.

80
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,810
Sometimes it gets a big laugh.
Sometimes it's just,

81
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,710
it's just clunky and I've got to figure
out which one's the right formula.

82
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,560
So the only way to do that really is to
listen to how I did it.

83
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,230
Right.
And then play it back and then write it

84
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:45,730
out.
I'll listen to how I said it and I'll

85
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:48,370
write it out.
And then I'll think about like what

86
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,140
would,
I would be thinking if I was sitting

87
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:52,390
there listening to this or if someone
was saying this,

88
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,810
you know what,
I anticipate what they're saying with

89
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:57,250
the punchlines are going to be
beforehand.

90
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:59,170
Because if you do that takes a lot out
of it.

91
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,420
You know?
It's got to find a way to sneak it in.

92
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:05,380
You've got to find a way to make it
where it really relates recordings or

93
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:09,610
ever have an uh,
an old bit that you like an old one from

94
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:11,950
like 10,
15 years ago that you'd think like,

95
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,740
damn,
I should have added that adding shit to

96
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:15,574
it today.

97
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,740
Oh yeah man,
if you kept going,

98
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,320
that's like the argument like already
had a good point about that.

99
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,160
He was like,
if you just keep adding to your bits and

100
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:27,400
making them better and that's why you
don't want to release a special,

101
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,270
you could have used that same creativity
to come up with new bits instead of

102
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,000
doing the same old bits for 10 years.
You could have used that.

103
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,250
You know,
cause there's some guys that think that

104
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,620
like if you got those old old,
old bits there,

105
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:40,840
Samurai swords,
man,

106
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:43,390
they'd just been hammering down and
Polish type

107
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,840
this,
they have this rhythm to them.

108
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:49,540
You're like Jesus Christ.
Like I remember,

109
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,370
um,
I did,

110
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:52,121
uh,
uh,

111
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:55,660
did a special once and I rent,
I didn't have like hardly any new

112
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:59,230
material and so there's like 2009 inch
or something like that.

113
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,350
So I did some of my old old shit from
like 1,999 tiger bit.

114
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:05,630
No,
no,

115
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,463
no.
It was uh,

116
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,260
some other stuff.
What I didn't,

117
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,180
I didn't do that,
but when I retired that bit,

118
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:12,790
I retired that but bringing that,
you can always bring that back,

119
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,070
bring that back.
It's over.

120
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,380
But uh,
but I remember thinking,

121
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:19,570
damn,
these are these old 10 year old bits.

122
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:23,380
And I had for like literally 10 years
before I did my first recording.

123
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,700
I started in 88 and I recorded in like
99 so almost 11 years for actually

124
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:30,700
recording anything there are so tight
because I had been,

125
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,700
I'd never done them on anything so I
could do them all the time.

126
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,251
Yeah,
I do.

127
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,300
I'm on the road or just they would just,
Yup,

128
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,353
Yup.
Yeah.

129
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,360
You learn how that path,
you got a fucking Ninja.

130
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,090
It's unconscious.
Yeah.

131
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,290
Yeah.
I love your description of what you were

132
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,420
talking about,
tying your shoes like you know how many

133
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:53,560
tire shoes you don't think this loops
going in here and this is going here and

134
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:58,010
then I'm going to bring it here and then
he just like that you wouldn't even

135
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,440
be able to eat.
You couldn't even teach it to someone

136
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,480
over the phone rings and it's teaching
me over the phone and be like,

137
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,970
I got to do it a few times first and
figure out what the hell I'm doing

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,840
because I don't even know what I'm
doing.

139
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,630
I have no idea what I'm doing when I
talk about shoes and I do it every day.

140
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,930
My son,
when he learned to tie her shoes like

141
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:13,670
maybe six months ago,
it was,

142
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,020
he never wanted to,
he's like,

143
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:18,510
he wants to do everything.
He wants to decide where we eat every

144
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,420
day,
but he doesn't want to tie his own shoe

145
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,620
laces.
So,

146
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,930
um,
we finally made him,

147
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:23,450
he,
you know,

148
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,550
and he was happy.
He was struggling with it.

149
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:30,551
And I use that as an opportunity to,
to show him how you can master anything.

150
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,930
Anything that you're having trouble
with.

151
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,050
Go look right now you're having trouble
that you could do what he could do it,

152
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,390
but he,
he struggles.

153
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,130
So one day you're going to do it like
Daddy,

154
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:40,970
like,
oh daddy does it.

155
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:45,050
I'm not even looking at my shoes.
Look and I do it and go boom.

156
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,810
And he's like,
I got to look at that crazy.

157
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,910
Isn't that crazy?
I'll do it again.

158
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,980
Look my other shoe and I do.
And he's like,

159
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:53,960
Whoa,
how'd you do that Daddy?

160
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,610
That's like magic.
And I go,

161
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,990
I go,
you can do it.

162
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:00,170
To Watch one day you'll go do it and
you're not even going to look.

163
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,450
So like the next day he's trying not to
look.

164
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:03,284
He's like,
Daddy,

165
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,400
I'm not looking.
Look,

166
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,780
hoodies,
he struggled,

167
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:12,110
but now he's got it that then now I
could use that,

168
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:14,230
that whole story that he won't forget
it.

169
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:15,080
Go.
Remember that.

170
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,190
Remember when you had trouble tying your
shoes and remember how good you can look

171
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:23,840
how you are now this is the same thing,
whether it's gymnastics or break dancing

172
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,640
or Jujitsu,
karate,

173
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,623
whatever we do,
it's,

174
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,960
it's the same exact thing.
Your body is magic.

175
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,620
You just got to tell it a thousand times
and then if I only listens and it'll do

176
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,600
it itself.
I thought about that today.

177
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,130
Not Today,
but like now look,

178
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:40,790
if someone,
if I had to learn today how to do like a

179
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,940
three 60 roundhouse kick.
Yeah.

180
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,560
At 50 years old I'd be like,
what?

181
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,950
What am I going to do?
Yeah.

182
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,690
I'd be like,
what are you doing?

183
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,090
But when I do it,
it just like,

184
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,710
it's just something I've done my whole
life.

185
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,360
Just Push,
you know,

186
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,110
it's like a dance and your bits,
like you were talking about like I bits

187
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:05,111
that you've been like your Noah's Ark
bit was so god Damn Tigers,

188
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,740
we were on the road,
you know,

189
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:08,750
back back in the day we were on the,
you know,

190
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:10,370
if you went on the road,
I hung out with you.

191
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,930
I went on the road and you know,
every,

192
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,850
if you weren't on the road,
we were at the comedy store every

193
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,020
weekend.
You weren't on the road.

194
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,160
So I saw your,
your act over and over and over to the

195
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:24,470
point where I wasn't listening to the
jokes no more.

196
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,780
I was listening to the audience
reaction.

197
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,870
That was what was entertaining.
I got to sit through another hour of

198
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:31,880
your shit.
So for me,

199
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:32,560
I,
uh,

200
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,770
I started,
uh,

201
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,260
being entertained by the audience.
Like,

202
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:39,200
which jokes work and,
and it's very,

203
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:41,600
it's fascinating when,
you know,

204
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,770
there's women out there,
they'd go out there and they had to drag

205
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:48,200
their husband out.
He didn't want to go out.

206
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:50,600
He wanted to stanch cause we,
you never take me out.

207
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,900
And she dragged him out.
He spent a lot of money there.

208
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,740
They're buying money,
they're buying drinks,

209
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,100
she

210
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,520
wants to make sure that they have a
great time.

211
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,390
So there's always like 10 of those wives
that dragged their husbands out and they

212
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:05,010
just want a lab.
So it's,

213
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,680
they're,
they're laughing at stuff that isn't the

214
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,060
punchline.
And you,

215
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:09,691
you,
you,

216
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:11,520
uh,
there was so many things that you would

217
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:14,070
say that just,
just the way you set them and wasn't,

218
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,660
it wasn't the,
the joke at all,

219
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:20,070
but there'd be like four chicks for just
laugh and they're like ready to laugh,

220
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,960
you know?
Well,

221
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,820
people that love standup comedy,
you definitely can get into like certain

222
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:28,060
rhythms,
but then you can,

223
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,250
it's like everything else,
right?

224
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,470
Like you,
you like one level of comedy,

225
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,870
like one kind of comedy,
but then you see a bunch of comedians

226
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:36,900
and then the original stuff that you
liked you'd think sucks.

227
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,060
Oh yeah.
I used to think comic view was the

228
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:40,440
funniest shit.

229
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,120
I was obsessed with coffee.
My whole life was all about music.

230
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:46,860
But my,
my two side things,

231
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,750
we're fighting.
I love boxing.

232
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:50,280
Ever since I was a kid.
I was a huge,

233
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:52,350
gigantic box and fan.
Then I got into the UFC,

234
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,720
but uh,
and then comedy,

235
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:58,440
it was a,
all I taped all I tape at home on my vcr

236
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:04,010
was comedy specials and Tuesday night
fights any kind of boxing.

237
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,760
And it was just comedy,
comedy and fights where my hobby and

238
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:11,010
music was the goal.
That was my life.

239
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,060
I take comm anytime comicview was on
that I have which ones?

240
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:16,710
Comic view.
It was all black.

241
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,300
Is that bet?
Yes.

242
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,860
Yes.
Is that the one that deals you will use

243
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,560
to host?
Okay.

244
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,100
And,
and uh,

245
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,933
you know,
uh,

246
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,830
you know,
live at the Apollo,

247
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,080
the def comedy jam.
I was the biggest fan of black comedy.

248
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,490
The biggest fan.
I mean,

249
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,773
you know,
right away.

250
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,850
And then you look back at like some of
those,

251
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,460
the standups after hanging out with you
though and all,

252
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,440
I started going,
Oh shit.

253
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:41,770
Okay.
That's load up all the,

254
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,220
a lot of those guys who are low level,
well it's just,

255
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:47,190
there's,
there's premises that just get,

256
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,390
you know,
there's,

257
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,420
there's guys out there like bill burr or
Dave Chappelle or the real high level

258
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:57,570
guys that are seeing things and then
they're commenting on things and they're

259
00:10:57,571 --> 00:10:59,760
pointing things out that maybe other
people didn't notice.

260
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,530
Then there's other people that are doing
bits because they know other people have

261
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:09,531
done bits on that subject successfully.
So it's not totally stealing,

262
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,100
but they're not really being creative.
They're just like trying to recreate

263
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,320
some mat.
There's a few guys that do that.

264
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,550
Like you,
you hear them and you go,

265
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,950
man,
you know that Bill Hicks did a bit about

266
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:20,490
that.

267
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,530
Like you know that this guy did a bit
about that.

268
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:25,590
Like I see what you're doing.
Like you're trying to like read,

269
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,740
like you don't have your own original
point.

270
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,440
A lot of those shows were like that.
They were just trying to make it,

271
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,580
cause it was the comedy boom man.
Well you're talking about was like there

272
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:39,060
was a comedy tv boom that included
evening at the Improv.

273
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:41,510
MTV,
half hour comedy hour spotlight,

274
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:46,511
lot spotlight live on vh one some Friday
night thing they had on Fox that uh,

275
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,670
used to be at the laugh factory.
They still have a police show.

276
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,980
It was crazy.
There was so much comedy,

277
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,260
it was out of control,

278
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,730
but there was a lot of guys that just
didn't belong in the business yet.

279
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,480
I mean,
I couldn't say that it couldn't

280
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:04,180
eventually have broke,
but they were basically like,

281
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,240
did you ever notice,
hey like there's a lot of those fucking

282
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:11,230
guys where they would like,
hey and there's a Goddamn wild kingdom

283
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,700
plan out my live in Rome.
Like they had this like comedy rhythm

284
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,890
that they would do,
but they didn't have shit to say.

285
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,540
But it's still worth a lot of those guys
were doing comedy to get a Sitcom.

286
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,480
They weren't tracking,
they didn't really want to do comedy.

287
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:25,780
Exactly.
Exactly.

288
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,540
Exactly.
They thought it'd be easier if they did

289
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,120
it that way.
Well,

290
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,090
there was a lot of actors that I talked
to about it.

291
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:31,691
They're like,
Hey Matt,

292
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:34,750
for me it's real hard to get auditions.
And he goes in for the longest time,

293
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:37,690
I'd sit around and watch you guys get
development deals and I'd be like,

294
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:38,230
fuck that.

295
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,360
These guys don't even act.
And then I realized like,

296
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:42,250
why am I complaining?
Why don't I just do what they do?

297
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,230
How hard could it be?
Yeah,

298
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,490
it's hard.
It's so easy.

299
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:53,610
Sam Aaa did a special last week at the
viper room and Hollywood man,

300
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,080
we've known Sam forever.
I don't know.

301
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,380
I have known him for 15 years or
something like that.

302
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,090
Maybe longer.
God Damn Dude,

303
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,020
God damn this exam special.
It was his first special,

304
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,810
you know,
it took them 10 years to get his shit

305
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,370
together.
But holy fuck,

306
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,430
that hour slammed beautiful.
She did is a viper two washes.

307
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,290
That's a great place to film a special
man.

308
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,240
It was.
I stayed for both shows.

309
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:21,100
He did.
You know when you film you do too,

310
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,650
like you know,
just in case something goes wrong and he

311
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:24,960
would do some stuff to,
it was weird.

312
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,130
I've never seen a comic before.

313
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,990
He fuck up a bit and go,
wait a minute,

314
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:32,020
let's do that one again and then start
again and do that like three times.

315
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:33,370
He just wanted to make sure it was
perfect.

316
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:36,010
You know what I mean?
Because the response was so great.

317
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,710
The he was just on stage.
He couldn't even believe it.

318
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,530
He couldn't,
everybody was dying in Edwards was

319
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:42,364
there.
Beautiful.

320
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:42,960
Yeah,
it was,

321
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,731
he,
it was,

322
00:13:43,731 --> 00:13:45,680
it's really good to see him,
uh,

323
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,040
blossom.
I think that,

324
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,560
you know,
based on the Netflix specials that I see

325
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,900
on average three minutes at a time,
I mean a lot of bad ones,

326
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,270
they're just putting out comedy specials
left and right.

327
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,270
My random dudes you never heard of,
and a lot of,

328
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,890
a of a lot of super vanilla,
Netflix,

329
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:07,540
comedy specials,
Vanilla,

330
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,820
like they're not going beep,
beep.

331
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,710
There's the little bit of that going on.

332
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,620
And there's also,
I think people need to fill more shows.

333
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,020
I think they're just filming one show
sometimes.

334
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,420
Sometimes too.
I really think if you can afford each

335
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:22,600
should do for Ricky Gervais is his new
one.

336
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,620
I was never a giant fan of,
has never really paid attention to him.

337
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:28,120
Like Ricky Gervais'.
Then you do like cartoons or something

338
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:30,520
like that.
His new special on Netflix.

339
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,830
That one is a grand slam.
He's fucking good.

340
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,680
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

341
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,080
That's awesome.
Can you see Chappelle's Oh yeah,

342
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,220
those are great.
Yeah.

343
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:40,920
How about the one in the belly row
about,

344
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,500
I mean I was there for that one.
Do you remember how we ended that shit?

345
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:49,530
Basically telling people exactly why he
went to Africa.

346
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,530
That's pretty crazy.
That took balls as dangerous shit.

347
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,110
Well he's really knows fuck.
I mean cat willy,

348
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:58,760
he's doing a specialist pretty good too.

349
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,150
I didn't like that one as much.
I didn't like it as much as I liked his

350
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,120
other ones.
He spent the first 20 minutes on

351
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,220
Jacksonville cause that's where he
filmed it and I thought,

352
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,120
you know,
okay,

353
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,400
I see what he's doing.
But he had some,

354
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,430
I thought he had some pretty good stuff
considering that,

355
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,440
you know,
all the crazy stuff he went through.

356
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,680
I thought maybe he'll never be back and
he's just going to be like insane or

357
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:20,090
whatever.
But he did.

358
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:22,620
He did come back and he is,
I'm a big fan of his

359
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,130
bolt,
salt stuff.

360
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,510
Some of the best.
Oh my God.

361
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:28,670
The pimp chronicles.
Come on.

362
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,110
Yes.
Katt Williams.

363
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,830
Katt Williams was a,
is one of the guys that if I'm just,

364
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,450
I don't have shit to listen to in my
car,

365
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,820
I just put youtube and just Katt
Williams,

366
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:38,930
just some random bit.

367
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,340
I,
if I don't have anything to go,

368
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:41,690
he's like,
he's a Goto.

369
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,190
Yeah,
he's a Goto for sure.

370
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,600
It's a good time,
man.

371
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,160
Good time for you.
And now the comedy store's unfucking

372
00:15:47,161 --> 00:15:49,310
believable.
It's nothing like we used to hang out

373
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:54,140
there every day and the early 2000 and
2000 2001 before 10th planet was even a

374
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:58,220
thought.
My life consisted of deejaying at strip

375
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:01,370
clubs for money at home,
trying to make it,

376
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:04,010
you know,
in music and hanging out with you doing

377
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:05,210
comedy,
you know,

378
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,190
it's crazy.
That was crazy.

379
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:09,260
And you think about that,
pleasure is always half empty.

380
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,310
Yes it was.
It was like a dying dinosaur.

381
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,730
It was ready to go and shit was ready to
go.

382
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:19,520
And then when you add that men see a
shit and you left man,

383
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,380
that the place was,
it was like,

384
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:24,010
how is it surviving like right there on
sunset,

385
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,970
such prime at the prime spot.

386
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,580
You could put a giant hotel there.
How's that place not going to get

387
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:30,950
knocked down?
And then when you came back,

388
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:32,640
I remember asking you a couple of times
and that,

389
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:35,040
that seven year absence or whatever it
was going,

390
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,030
do you ever get to go back to the comedy
store?

391
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,640
Because I wanted you to to go back and
you were like,

392
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,920
fuck that.
I ain't called back.

393
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:44,240
You were like really?
Like,

394
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,160
you know,
you felt like you got really screwed by

395
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:48,470
them and you did.
Those mother fuckers turned their back

396
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:52,220
on you at the comedy store and took that
dude side and now looking back,

397
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,500
they know they made a big mistake.
So you were like,

398
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,570
you standing in Goddamn ground like fuck
that.

399
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:58,400
I'll go to the ice house.
So I'll go to Improv,

400
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:00,980
fuck the congress store.
And then you came back man.

401
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,720
And it's in,
it's like,

402
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,630
uh,
a different world.

403
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,340
Literally a different world.
Like,

404
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,510
it's fucking booman is selling out every
goddamn night.

405
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,880
Bolt rooms are packed.
It's like,

406
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:15,440
uh,
it's like,

407
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,540
it's unbelievable.
Like you couldn't,

408
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,410
nobody would believe that shit.
It's so alive at the comedy store.

409
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,630
People just go there like during the
week,

410
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:25,160
like it's a big event.
Tuesday nights,

411
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,810
Tuesday,
Tuesday nights sometimes they have two

412
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,890
sold out shows.
Khurram and the original,

413
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:30,960
the comedy chaos Tuesdays.
Yeah.

414
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,150
The father's never been like that,
but no,

415
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,580
it was buck.
They opened up all those,

416
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,430
those old decrepit brooms and made a
bark.

417
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,670
Like they're opening up a everything's,
there's all these bar that used to be a

418
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:42,530
video room.
That back bar is the best he can get

419
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,390
away from people and chill out back
there.

420
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,210
Yeah.
That she wasn't around back in the

421
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,200
[inaudible].
That was probably the whole smoking car

422
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,100
door in the back now.

423
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,610
Yeah.
But he goes out back to south side,

424
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,510
the outside bar.
It's booming.

425
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,850
There's always people there drinking.
It's,

426
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,780
it's crazy weird.
Right.

427
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,070
The Bar's always mobbed.
It helps nuggets.

428
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,700
And then across the street,
House of Blues,

429
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:06,930
they knock that shit down.
Like when you walk outside and you go up

430
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:08,880
that ramp,
you know that ramp is and the parking

431
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,850
lot next door and get that views insane.
Yeah,

432
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,820
the view's incredible.
Like they have the best view in the

433
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:16,980
world.
Comedy stores like,

434
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:20,760
um,
it's like guns and roses slam big and

435
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:25,730
the fucking eighties disappeared for 20
fucking years.

436
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,860
25 years.
And now guns and roses not only made a

437
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:31,110
comeback,
but they're bigger than ever.

438
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,750
They're bigger than ever.
It guns and roses.

439
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,460
Unbelievable.
Everywhere they play,

440
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:39,720
they're just sell it out and it's in,
I saw him in Mexico City and got

441
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,880
completely blown away.
I was like Mexico City,

442
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:45,510
we there for seminar.
I was there for combat.

443
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:46,560
You Tony's fight.

444
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,340
That's crazy.
You saw.

445
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,393
Yeah,
that brings us,

446
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,741
oh,
it was incredible.

447
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:56,250
And I was never a giant guns and roses
fan.

448
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,800
I respected them.
I like their songs and shit.

449
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:00,210
But you know,
as a kid,

450
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,480
once one of your friends claims them as
their favorite and now they can't be

451
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:05,220
your favorite.
So it's like some stupid shit.

452
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,980
It's some stupid shit.
Like my friend Matt,

453
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,960
he claimed guns and roses and I'm like,
okay,

454
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,270
cause we wouldn't,
if,

455
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,530
if he bought a guns and roses record,
I would just tape it.

456
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,920
I wouldn't buy it too.
So whoever actually own that,

457
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:18,450
the master,
you know what I mean?

458
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:19,980
That was their band,
you know what I mean?

459
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:21,090
Fuck you.
That's my band.

460
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,680
It's like a sport.
It really is.

461
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,810
But you have a bunch of teams like
yours.

462
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,240
My band was kiss cause I,
even when everyone made fun of him,

463
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:31,440
I'm the only one who admitted they still
liked him for a while.

464
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,850
Then you get like that with boxers to
no,

465
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,020
with boxing was different.
It was boxing is all racist.

466
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,760
It's completely racist.
And it's okay.

467
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Boxing's the only sport,
it's the only sport you could be racist,

468
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,810
black guy will not ever have generally
is bummer general.

469
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,360
It was Donald Curry getting knocked out
by Mike Mcowen,

470
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,240
Mike,
Mike Tyson font.

471
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,870
When Mike Tyson fought Gerry Cooney,
every white guy,

472
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,510
white guy did Mike Tyson.
I saw what a bunch of white guys,

473
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:08,190
but not anybody famous.
No,

474
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:10,020
not really.
Um,

475
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,420
anybody.
Well,

476
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,500
uh,
Gelada coolish guy who was,

477
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,920
that's right.
That's right.

478
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,090
But does he comes wipe?
Yeah,

479
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,500
he's from Poland.
A lot of them is pretty well times the

480
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:24,080
European whites.
We don't think of them as American war.

481
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,120
The animals.
Yeah,

482
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,460
we definitely,
yeah,

483
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,340
we want like Russians are always going
to go for the Russian guy.

484
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,960
So boxing is the only one.

485
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,680
Like I didn't give a fuck who the
Mexican was fighting.

486
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:40,050
I'm going for the Mexican.
Even if I didn't know the Mexican,

487
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:41,510
I already had love for him.
Yeah,

488
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,910
he wasn't Mexican and he was Panamanian.
That's good enough.

489
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,310
Right.
If he was Argentinian,

490
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,850
you know one role,
Dan,

491
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:51,130
remember him.
I remember Argentina,

492
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,800
that guys,
if he's fighting a Mexican,

493
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:56,440
I'm going for the Mexican.
But if he's fighting a white guy or a

494
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:58,570
black guy,
I'm always going for the Latin guy.

495
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,780
That the only sport where you could be
totally racist.

496
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,060
My best friend was black growing up and
we,

497
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,570
we both watched boxing together and he
always went for the black guy.

498
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:09,340
I always went for the Latin guy and it
was like,

499
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:11,230
it was okay.
There was nothing wrong with that.

500
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,660
Who was another a Argentinian champion
that was champion before?

501
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,940
Um,
Marvin Hagler.

502
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,690
God Damn it.

503
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,050
It's at the tip of my tongue.
I cannot remember.

504
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:24,880
His name was Pepino.
Cuevas.

505
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,390
Alexis are guayle.
As long as there were Latin,

506
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:32,350
there were Mexican to me.
He was right before Marvin Hagler.

507
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,380
God dammit.
I see him.

508
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:39,880
I see his curly hair.
A handsome and fellow calls Mons on.

509
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,260
Thank God I got it.
It was great.

510
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,080
Pull it up.
Jamie's going to pull it up before I go.

511
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,150
Remember [inaudible] zone was a bad
mother fucker,

512
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:51,970
wasn't he from Argentina?
It was beautiful.

513
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,200
Yeah.
He was a tough guy,

514
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:54,370
man.
There was a,

515
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:56,440
those are the blood and guts days of
boxing.

516
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,200
You know,
Roberto Duran can be candidate

517
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:02,110
lightweight,
135 pound killers.

518
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,270
It was a different world back then,
man.

519
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:08,110
Those guys were tough as shit.
15 round fights is different though.

520
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:09,730
I always,
I was always the,

521
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,180
I,
I,

522
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,260
there was a point where I thought
generally overall just black people are

523
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:17,020
way funnier than white people based on
stand up comedy.

524
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,441
I was like,
give,

525
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:20,010
this was like a little Richard Pryor.
Eddie Murphy,

526
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,360
you know,
I really believe that.

527
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,720
And like Mexican communities.
I wasn't like rooting for Paul

528
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,090
Rodriguez.
I was like,

529
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,550
oh good.
I was,

530
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,140
I didn't,
yeah,

531
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:30,850
I know some people do,
but I didn't.

532
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,760
I was,
I,

533
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,760
I was,
uh,

534
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,290
you know,
now he's just against the white and see

535
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,630
him more than anything.
When people found out it wasn't really

536
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,030
Mexican,
they were like,

537
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:41,940
what?
He's on Dorian.

538
00:22:41,941 --> 00:22:43,860
Ron during a German or something.
Yeah.

539
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,980
Did he ever see some Mexican?
Yes.

540
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,070
Yeah.
He was like,

541
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,480
he doesn't anymore.
It was like an end.

542
00:22:52,481 --> 00:22:54,760
Andrew dice clay,
he was kind of raised by Mexican people

543
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:55,620
though.
He should,

544
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,650
he should have said that.
And he said,

545
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:57,510
listen,
this isn't all,

546
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,080
it's just this like,
it's my character.

547
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,530
I'll change your name.
Carlis I'm calling them and see.

548
00:23:01,531 --> 00:23:03,010
I couldn't,
we change Andrew dice clay.

549
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,170
Yeah,
but that's first of all,

550
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:08,110
that's like a character name,
but I'm saying like saying your

551
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:09,380
ethnicity,
maybe Carlos.

552
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,850
I had to put tape on my eyes and trying
to save his Kareo Chan.

553
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,830
He would be like,
what?

554
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,180
Right?
You can't do that.

555
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,450
But if you try to claim,
if I tried to claim German,

556
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
right,
just out of nowhere,

557
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,620
like you don't know any better,
you'd never see my 23 and now maybe you

558
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:25,000
did like a [inaudible] character where
you're,

559
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:27,880
could you do German accent?
Not Arnold Schwarzenegger.

560
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,230
Uh,
that's Austrian.

561
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:30,670
Oh,
okay.

562
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,780
Yeah.
Um,

563
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,060
no.
I don't think I could probably do one if

564
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:37,120
I may.
The Arnold so easy.

565
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,810
So like I can only do sir.
I can't do trump,

566
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:42,480
man.
You can't do trump.

567
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,720
No,
I can't do it at all.

568
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,040
My voice doesn't make those sounds like
I'm

569
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,460
not a good impressionist.
I'm just good at the ones that I can do.

570
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,280
What does Arnold think?
A trump busy.

571
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,890
We've had this conversation before is
not a bad guy.

572
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,150
He's just a guy.
Oh,

573
00:23:56,151 --> 00:24:00,110
that's right.
He's listening.

574
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:02,060
He's doing what everybody wants.
He's making billions.

575
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:04,460
He's fucking porn stars.
And you're mad at him.

576
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,470
This is the fucking American Jean who
looks like Bro.

577
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,480
For real though,
who looks like him and fucks like he

578
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:12,450
does.
I,

579
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,200
I'm a little bit more impressed with
donald after all the scandals.

580
00:24:15,201 --> 00:24:16,950
It backfired.
You guys will try and go,

581
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,460
no Clinton on this guy.
He's not trying to fuck kids so that,

582
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:21,940
hey,
here's a thing about it,

583
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,970
like Roseanne Barr,
they were saying that Roseanne Barr was,

584
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:30,230
uh,
was talking about some conspiracy

585
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:33,570
theories that have been disproven.
This is what some thing,

586
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:35,240
cause she was talking about trump,
break it up,

587
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,380
child sex rings.

588
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,950
But he really did spend a lot of time
concentrating on that and having people

589
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,030
go out and try to break up the sex rings
and sex trafficking.

590
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,820
Like this is not something that is a
conspiracy theory.

591
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,490
This is something that he's discussed
many times.

592
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,330
It's also not a conspiracy that there's
sex trafficking.

593
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,670
So as much as you want to discount
trump,

594
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,490
here's a problem that I have with people
that are on the left right now.

595
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,560
They didn't do not looking at
everything,

596
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,110
throwing,
looking at what they want to look at.

597
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,960
He's bad for the environment.
He's always lying.

598
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,850
He cheats on his wife.
He does this,

599
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:12,470
he does that.
They say all these things that he does

600
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,570
bad.
But when something comes up,

601
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:16,370
like Roseanne says,
ah,

602
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:20,120
I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt
because he's going after sex trafficking

603
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,050
and then it turns out all these other
people.

604
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,110
So that's conspiracy theory.
That's a bullshit online.

605
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,610
No,
he said it.

606
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,790
He's put effort into it.
Like you gotta give the Guy Credit

607
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,250
because if you don't give them credit
for things that he does at are

608
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:33,230
important,
nobody's going to listen to you when

609
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,970
you're criticizing them either because
you,

610
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:38,300
all you're trying to do is when you're
not trying to look at the thing for what

611
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:39,320
it really is.
Yeah.

612
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:41,660
He's this guy and he's not perfect
person,

613
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,960
but he did make note on many times about
at wanting to break up stuff,

614
00:25:47,501 --> 00:25:49,890
just sex trafficking rings.
You know that you're,

615
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,630
uh,
your kid is 20,000 times more likely to

616
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:56,090
get kidnapped them to get shot or to
school.

617
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,320
Does that make sense?
Yeah.

618
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,640
At 20,000 it's conservative.
It's probably really like 70,000,

619
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:06,641
because if you go by the numbers,
800,000 to a million kids go missing

620
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,510
every year in the United States.

621
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,220
And I looked that up though.
That doesn't,

622
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,310
I'd never found a source for that.
You said that before and I looked that

623
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:15,110
up and I couldn't find that.
It wasn't nearly as,

624
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,890
I read it online so it could be wrong.
It cause a problem with these things,

625
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:20,450
like when we say,
especially if you say it,

626
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:22,730
I'm like right now 2 million people are
going to listen to this or whatever.

627
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:27,731
The fucking knows.
Even if it's a 100,100 if it's 102

628
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,060
hundred kids,
that's more than school.

629
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,460
One of y'all.
To my point,

630
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,500
it's more than school shootings.
Like what would you rather have your,

631
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:35,610
you know what's worse?
I don't know what's worse.

632
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,520
Get having your Kubrick shot at any,
right.

633
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,800
Look at this.
According to the National Center for

634
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:42,380
missing exploited children,
citing US Department of Justice report,

635
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:43,830
nearly 800,000 children

636
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,610
are reported missing each year.
That's more than 2000 a day.

637
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,780
The end.
See Mec says 203,000 children are

638
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:54,270
kidnapped each year by family members.
Oh,

639
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:57,930
family.
That's a little bit of six thousand six

640
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:58,330
hundred thousand.
Yeah,

641
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,130
that'd be 600,000.
So what's worse has always having your

642
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:03,340
kid,
cause uh,

643
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,600
cause the conspiracy theory is that
there's this giant international child

644
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:13,740
sex trafficking network going on that is
being covered up.

645
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,160
That's what's going on.
And if you look at a Jimmy Salvo in the

646
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:21,670
UK that brought a lot of light to what's
going saddle savile.

647
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,390
Yeah.
That was a terrifying story.

648
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,390
The story with him is Jimmy Savile.
He's dead now.

649
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:29,700
He died in his eighties at,
in 2011.

650
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,210
He was uh,
uh,

651
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,190
a super famous like Dick Clark kind of
guy.

652
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:38,580
He was a d,
he was the host of a pop top of the

653
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:40,260
pops.
Um,

654
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,710
it's like if your band got on that show,
you're going to be mega.

655
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,680
He was huge.
He was friends with the royal family,

656
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:49,020
with the prime minister's Margaret
Thatcher,

657
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
Tony Blair,
a picture of him.

658
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,390
He looks disgusting.
Pull up Jimmy savile.

659
00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:55,260
This guy looks like a child.
Look at this guy.

660
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,170
Look at this guy.
I was just super fucked by that guy.

661
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:01,800
Check this out.
But he was 12 super,

662
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,920
super famous and you know what he would
do?

663
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,400
He would raise money for hospitals and
specifically psychiatric hospitals and

664
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:17,340
he would bring the queen of England and
he got all this power to raise millions

665
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,310
for these hospitals,
these mental institutions.

666
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:22,770
He,
that's what he prayed on it for kids,

667
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,600
so he would,
what he would do is he would,

668
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,050
he would do so much for these hospitals
that he would put himself on the board

669
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:30,540
and give himself a job.
They're in a position and he would hang

670
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,310
out at these hospitals.
There's all,

671
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:35,880
there's at least five.
There's at least 500 people that have

672
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,940
come forward to say they've been were
raped by him.

673
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,790
When that ran a 500 people,
at least it's in the thousands so that

674
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,250
he's holding up on his neck.
What does that say to me?

675
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,120
Oh yeah,
he would fix it.

676
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,490
He worked,
he worked for the BBC,

677
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,700
super famous super,
and he would,

678
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,170
he had Christmas dinner with Margaret
Thatcher Multiple Times.

679
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,290
What does that red hat?
He's got the,

680
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:01,200
it looks like a maggot hat right above
that.

681
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,063
Yeah.

682
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:09,540
There's a crazy guy who it turns out he
was a child rapist.

683
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,250
Yeah.
And um,

684
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,050
that's the same thing with Sandusky and
the covering Husky guy it up.

685
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,750
The question is becoming this old dude.
Yes.

686
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:22,710
Because people knew they're complicit
and they then trump the mystery.

687
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,240
The mystery is how is he so tight with
the prime ministers,

688
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:30,120
the royal family,
all these politicians,

689
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,390
all this shit comes out when he died.
Cause every time there would be an

690
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:36,240
allegation while he was alive,
she would just sit them down and go,

691
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,580
what are you going to do now?
I'm going to ruin your life.

692
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,920
You better drop this shit.
What are you going to do?

693
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:42,100
You think they're going to come after
me?

694
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,470
You know how many millions are given
this hospital?

695
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,080
So he would just shut everything down.
Right.

696
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,020
And there was all these underground
covered up allegations.

697
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,360
Did getting knighthood was a relief
because it got me off the hook.

698
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,240
What does that mean?
You got me off.

699
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,480
He was knighted.
So got him off the hook.

700
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,330
What do you think is that he got
knighted when you get knighted?

701
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:02,740
Could they,
could they not arrest you anymore?

702
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:04,720
Is that what happens?
Is it like being the president?

703
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,740
Yeah,
there's a,

704
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:09,670
there's a documentary on Youtube called
the ninth circle.

705
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,680
Jimmy Savile,
the ninth circle.

706
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,670
You find out why they covered it up.
Why did they cover it up?

707
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:17,380
Widen this agent,
Dj these.

708
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,510
It's like Dick Clark.
They should've just mashed them up.

709
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,260
Why was it all being covered up?
It's fucking insane.

710
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:26,500
When you find out why has it for dead
bodies in general,

711
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:28,720
the key dead people.

712
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:33,100
Why he loved fucking dead people.
What'd you hear this then the nights are

713
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:38,110
green.
The ninth circle to watch that Jesus

714
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,640
Christ.
It's insane.

715
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,280
It's insane.
When you find out when you watch that

716
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:47,281
shit dude,
it is crazy that you like you're saying

717
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:54,301
this and it sounds like,
like it can never be possible.

718
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,700
It sounds like it never,
it could be possible that some giant

719
00:30:57,701 --> 00:30:59,760
television star that worked with
children.

720
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,990
It was always helping out.
Children could have actually been

721
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:04,930
fucking them the whole time and a bunch
of them,

722
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:07,750
hundreds of raping them and then people
must have known.

723
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,900
There's no way to everybody.
He was killing them too.

724
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,790
He was killing him.
He was killing them,

725
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:13,480
dude.
They got,

726
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,550
they found all these bodies.
It's a [inaudible].

727
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,070
It's a big scandal in the UK.
Hold up right now.

728
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,060
Look,
Jesus Christ,

729
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:26,890
there's an island called Jersey island.
It's owned by the Queen and look into

730
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:27,430
that shit.

731
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,830
I don't even want to get that.
I don't even want to get that deep into

732
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:34,030
it because that I don't have a rape
children as young as nine while working

733
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:37,840
at BBC leaked report on veils.
And this is in the independent.

734
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,161
Yeah.
How come?

735
00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:41,080
Why not?
How come there's not the same kind of

736
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:44,330
effort for this kind of stuff like there
is with the um,

737
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,790
um,
the gun shooting,

738
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,920
the Florida school shooting.
Why isn't there,

739
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,880
because that's not a big event where
it's one thing where all the deaths

740
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:54,340
happen in one deaths or deaths.
I understand.

741
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,750
I'm with you.
I understand.

742
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,680
But I mean this is also why people don't
freak out about 500,000 people dying

743
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:01,360
every year because of obesity.
Like what would you,

744
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:02,290
what's worse?
What's worse?

745
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,320
Having your kid get shot at a school
shooting or having that motherfucker

746
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:11,240
rape your daughter and multiple times
and then kill it.

747
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,210
I don't think what's worse.
They're both hard.

748
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,800
Exactly.
It's horrible.

749
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,730
What's scary is that that is being
protected.

750
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,730
Yes.
There's someone that either knew about

751
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,430
it and now he's trying to cover their
ass because they knew about it.

752
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,840
That was the thing about Sandusky.
Y'All saying Guskey did the same thing.

753
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:33,340
He was raping all these kids and the
whole time he was running these programs

754
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:36,490
for underprivileged children and helping
all these orphaned kids.

755
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,050
You've got to watch your kids,
man.

756
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,550
You got to watch a he away with abusing
500

757
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,970
children and sex with dead bodies.
Whoa.

758
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,010
Hanging out with the queen.
Did this guys tight with the cooking

759
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:52,980
them to God
and all these little kids around him?

760
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,890
You know what you want me to tell you
why he got,

761
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,030
why they left him alone?
You do know according to the ninth

762
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:00,740
circle,
what does the ninth sorts,

763
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:05,090
it's a documentary about the whole thing
I'll cover on because everybody's doing

764
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:06,170
it.
They're all doing it.

765
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:11,120
He was supplying everybody with kids.
That's what he used the hospitals for.

766
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,080
Well this is not a new theory.
This is not a new theory when it comes

767
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:17,600
to like groups of freaks.
He was a pimp.

768
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,170
He was supplying everybody with kids.
This is,

769
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,240
this is something that people have
talked about,

770
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:27,320
like very intelligent people that I know
that have talked about in terms of like,

771
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:29,390
uh,
there's been stories about people that

772
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:34,391
have taken politicians to like islands
and shit because that's where they keep

773
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:35,600
like young girls.

774
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:36,980
You know,
I don't know why I'm looking at you

775
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,690
jammy dude.
And you know what,

776
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,350
but there's,
but someone talked to me about this and

777
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:44,870
they were saying,
you have to understand that if you are

778
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,830
in a group of incredibly wealthy people
and you have extreme,

779
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,540
a desire for extreme sexual scenarios,
whips and,

780
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,400
and you can't,
whatever the fuck it is,

781
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:59,240
you can't young girls,
you can't let anybody know about this.

782
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,950
So people come into these people's lives
that can facilitate these things and

783
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:06,680
then they developed a sort of bond of
silence.

784
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,620
And this is how when this shit gets out
of hand,

785
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,370
you can get a Jimmy savile or you can
get a Jerry Sandusky.

786
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,740
They'll say one thing about [inaudible]
there was like,

787
00:34:15,741 --> 00:34:17,360
this is not,
sky was not on his own.

788
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:21,590
Like he was supplying chill iceberg.
Wasn't that one of the things they,

789
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:26,591
that doesn't come up San Dusky Google
sent Dusky was supplying children to

790
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:30,230
other pedophiles because that was
something that was also speculated about

791
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:32,750
some of the donors that were donors to
his,

792
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:33,950
uh,
his charities.

793
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,950
We're also somehow involved in molesting
those kids.

794
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,470
You know what a death right?
Is death ride,

795
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,730
death ride.
No.

796
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:46,030
Jimmy savile would supply 10,
15 boys to a certain politician.

797
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,730
Um,
he'd have a boat,

798
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,280
he'd take them out on the boat.
He couldn't,

799
00:34:52,281 --> 00:34:54,020
he couldn't afford to have any
witnesses.

800
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:57,980
So those were always the last rides.
Those kids would take their called death

801
00:34:57,981 --> 00:35:00,710
rides.
She couldn't have ways.

802
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,980
This is from that same documentary ninth
circle c,

803
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,200
but how do they know that for a fact?
You just got to watch it and,

804
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:08,390
and uh,
and make the,

805
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,370
uh,
conclusion.

806
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,060
I'm not low.
I'm not ruling it about to get shit

807
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:15,470
back.
So you got to look at him like a

808
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:17,450
prosecuting attorney,
not a defense lawyer.

809
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,950
He's already a shitbag.
He's already confirmed already ripping

810
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,350
kids.
What's the stop of killing?

811
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,840
Exactly.
Exactly.

812
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,230
Yeah.
I mean,

813
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,830
that's a good point because if you're
the type of person that could rate a

814
00:35:26,831 --> 00:35:27,920
child,
what can't you do?

815
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,630
And that's what I'm saying,
right?

816
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,900
In the UK,
the numbers could be wrong,

817
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:37,901
but I heard that every three seconds a
child is reported missing in the UK,

818
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,330
ever.
That's 175,000 kids a year get reported

819
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:44,160
missing in the,
in the UK,

820
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,070
it's a big businessman has got to be
more than that.

821
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,910
It's a Jochen's in a year.
Isn't that every three seconds at

822
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:54,330
175,000 that seems low.
Every three minutes.

823
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:55,980
I'm sorry,
39 every three seconds.

824
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:56,814
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

825
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,550
Is Crazy.

826
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,270
Every three minutes,
every three minutes.

827
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:06,930
This is according to something I saw.
31 million seconds in a day.

828
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

829
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,460
Um,
I'm sure the numbers are probably a

830
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,930
hundred.
175,000 isn't as big as 800,000 a year,

831
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:17,760
but damn,
that's,

832
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:22,761
that should be pick up on all this out.
What we're doing for the Florida

833
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:26,460
shooting and for the shootings and what
that David Hogg Guy Come on man.

834
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,370
That that's what's scary is that people
are buying all that stuff,

835
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:34,490
buying all what stuff?
The whole gun control propaganda.

836
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,340
You know,
it's so obvious.

837
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,030
It's,
it's,

838
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,150
it's ridiculous.
It's ridiculous thing to gun control.

839
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,910
Propagandas it's really simple,
man.

840
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It's like they've been,
you have to disarm the population and

841
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:53,190
that's what they're doing.
And by Ann's trying to disarm it,

842
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,960
they used to say,
they used to say,

843
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,120
oh no,
we just want some restrictions and some

844
00:36:57,121 --> 00:36:58,860
background checks.
Now they're just saying it.

845
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,490
You know,
some people are saying revoke the second

846
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:05,400
amendment.
They're tearing the constitution.

847
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,370
They're tearing the constitution.
Those four kids,

848
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,940
those four kids,
there's a concept.

849
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,041
They weren't,
they weren't,

850
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:11,920
that's not true.
No,

851
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,840
no.
That's photoshop.

852
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,740
No it isn't.
Yeah.

853
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,470
Original image that that girl was
tearing.

854
00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:19,280
It was like a target target.
Okay.

855
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,350
Someone replaced that image with the
constant.

856
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:23,580
Okay,
but they're essentially doing the same

857
00:37:23,581 --> 00:37:24,091
thing.
Yeah.

858
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:24,990
No,
I know what you're saying.

859
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,863
They look,
first of all,

860
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,100
they're 17 they were at a school that
got shot up.

861
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,710
Their friends died.
I get it from their point of view.

862
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,190
If I was 17 I would think,
and also they got cameras in their face

863
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,970
and everybody's paying attention to them
and ever.

864
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,030
The New York Times is interviewing on
the Washington Post.

865
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:40,710
Everyone's calling them up.
If I was them,

866
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:41,790
I'd probably be doing the same thing.

867
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,640
You would probably too,
if you were in high school with those

868
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:48,090
kids and all that shit went down.
I don't blame them by any stretch of the

869
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:49,920
imagination.
I don't even blame people that are

870
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:54,480
trying to revoke the second amendment.
The thing that infuriates me the most is

871
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,790
that all people want to look at is the
guns.

872
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,450
That's all they want to look at.
You need to look at the mental health of

873
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:03,330
individuals that are willing to fucking
shoot up a group of kids.

874
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,640
Like why?
Why the fuck would someone do that?

875
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,870
Psychiatric medications are a big one
that if you bring up people roll their

876
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:10,501
eyes like,
oh,

877
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:14,850
this again.
There are massive changes to the fucking

878
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:17,940
chemical composition of your brain.
When you take these things,

879
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,880
what you're capable of doing,
what bothers you,

880
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,400
what freaks you out,
what you don't give a shit about.

881
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,470
When you got all these people that are
on an Ssri,

882
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,130
antidepressants and anti anxiety
medication and over and over and over

883
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:30,630
again.
When they test these shooters,

884
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,010
they all test positive for something.
The pharmaceutical companies do not want

885
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,960
fucking hear about this.
They don't want to talk about this.

886
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,360
Phil Hartman,
my friend who got shot by his wife,

887
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,570
she was on Zoloft.
They got a settlement from zoloft.

888
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,840
The family got a settlement from zoloft
after she fucking shot him in the head

889
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:48,460
while he was sleeping.
This is,

890
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,640
there's a lot going on.
It's not just guns.

891
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,880
It is crazy that that fucked up kid
could get guns.

892
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,210
It is crazy to just crazy it.
The FBI went to his house two years

893
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,480
before,
but what can you do?

894
00:39:00,481 --> 00:39:02,420
Do you hear about the kid that they just
stopped and China,

895
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,250
the Chinese immigrant kid,
they're sending back that his roommates

896
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:07,800
in college,
we're saying this fucking guy's

897
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:08,980
stockpile and guns.

898
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,860
The cops went to visit him.
He went and bought another gun and he's

899
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:14,770
talking all kinds of crazy shit and
everybody's nervous about him.

900
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,530
Like he's a fucking shooter,
wedded,

901
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,490
ready to happen.
Stop going to class.

902
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,700
And that's how they sent him back
because he's on a student visa.

903
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,270
You can't not be in class.
This kid was like gearing up.

904
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,350
He was gearing up and maybe,
maybe they caught it before it happened

905
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:32,290
and maybe they wouldn't have like two
years ago when they interviewed this,

906
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:35,760
uh,
the kid from Parkland now decayed.

907
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,780
The strangest thing about the parkland
shooting is the interview one of the

908
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:45,130
teachers did on ABC.
That's this,

909
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:47,050
this doesn't make any sense to me at
all.

910
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,660
It's like she said,
um,

911
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,890
I have the video.
I could send it to you,

912
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:52,071
Jen.
I,

913
00:39:52,071 --> 00:39:53,500
it's,
it's less than a minute.

914
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,850
She says,
why?

915
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,000
I opened up,
I heard the,

916
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,910
I heard shots.

917
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,270
I opened up the door.
All the kids ran in the hid behind their

918
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:04,930
desk and there I saw the shooter 20 feet
away from me,

919
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,660
but at first I thought he was a
policeman.

920
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:09,190
I'm like,
what is the police doing here?

921
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:14,470
He had full body armor and mask on a
helmet on and was shooting.

922
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,140
I was like,
what is the cost?

923
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:19,300
What are the cops doing here?
That is the strangers,

924
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,170
uh,
video I've seen because possibly someone

925
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,210
shooting at the kid.
That's not what she said.

926
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,180
She said she saw the shooter.
That's right,

927
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:29,950
but I mean,
how long was she watching for?

928
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,510
Right?
If you're like looking out the window

929
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:34,780
and you see someone that's shooting
someone or shooting a gun or even

930
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:35,920
holding a gun,
first of all,

931
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:38,230
you have to realize that people in those
traumatic situations,

932
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:39,970
their memory is very fucked up.

933
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,880
It's very shaky.
Your brain's flooded with adrenaline.

934
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,190
You may remember your openness
suggestion.

935
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,490
People can put things in your head and
you all of a sudden think that that was

936
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:51,430
a real memory that you saw.
There's been like scientific studies on

937
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:55,250
that and about suggestive memory and
about someone can literally it,

938
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,190
especially during periods of great
duress,

939
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:01,180
they can introduce ideas into your head
and you will tell those ideas

940
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,010
hours later,
days later as your own and you don't

941
00:41:06,011 --> 00:41:07,780
even realize that they put them in your
head.

942
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,410
It's real weird memory in traumatic
situations like guns,

943
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,790
shootouts and shit like that is haywire
because you're on,

944
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,130
you're working on that reptilian part of
your brain.

945
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,510
You're down to the lowest level.
Like my friend Steve Rinella got

946
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:25,990
attacked by a grizzly bear.
He was in a fog neck island.

947
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:27,550
It's a crazy podcast.
Heman.

948
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:30,460
These other guys,
they had killed an elk and they were

949
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:34,100
packing this elk out and they left the
elk by the tree while they were at their

950
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:34,490
camp.

951
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,820
Then they went to go back and a baird
claim the elk and this bear rushed him

952
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,550
and he was like,
the one of the ways you described to me,

953
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:43,850
it's like you have an idea in your head
of like what?

954
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,640
Like an animal instinct is like,
and he goes,

955
00:41:46,641 --> 00:41:48,830
I'm telling you,
this goes way deeper than that.

956
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,611
This goes,
wait,

957
00:41:49,611 --> 00:41:51,860
when you really think your life is in
danger,

958
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,410
you really think it's over.
You don't even exist anymore.

959
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,230
You're moving.
You have no idea what you're doing.

960
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:00,320
You're you're you.
You have to piece together what happened

961
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,870
afterwards and you were barely there in
the first place.

962
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:05,030
You're just gone.
You're gone.

963
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:10,180
You see somebody else like you have no
fucking idea who you even are right

964
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:12,230
there.
And then all these people that like I

965
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:14,510
would have run in the building kicked
that fucking guy's ass.

966
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,630
You barely even know who you are.
You've got this video.

967
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,970
Oh,
I sent you the video,

968
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:25,820
the video of that.
People have to understand memory.

969
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,730
Well,
let's listen to her and then let's see

970
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:29,850
if she sounds like,
okay,

971
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,530
let's hear what she says.
I actually sent,

972
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,340
sent you that the actual clips at the
one.

973
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:38,900
This is not it.
Didn't I send,

974
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,600
I sent you one right on your phone.
This is not it though.

975
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,460
That's,
that's the lady.

976
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:46,560
But I don't know when,
when she's going to say let's just play

977
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:47,990
it cause we don't hear it.
We're not hearing it,

978
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:48,940
Jamie.
That's good.

979
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:54,320
Dick Writing Love Letters.
When the fire alarm went off,

980
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,520
as students filed into the hallway,
she heard gun fire.

981
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,590
The killing had begun.
Okay.

982
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,590
I was about two feet away from my door.
All of a sudden I heard gunshots in the

983
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:05,540
stairwell,
which is about 20 feet away from my

984
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,630
room.
And then kids were screaming and then

985
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:11,600
running back towards me and towards the
end of the hallway.

986
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:15,740
So I just went in this very strange
autopilot mode where I pivoted on my

987
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:18,610
feet.
I unlocked my door and the kids just

988
00:43:18,611 --> 00:43:20,360
start pouring in my room.
I don't know how many kids were in

989
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:22,490
there,
but it was pulling them and getting them

990
00:43:22,491 --> 00:43:24,140
in and shouting at them to get in the
room.

991
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,520
And then I suddenly saw the shooter
about 20 feet from me standing at the

992
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:31,070
end of the hallway,
actively shooting down the hallway,

993
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,400
just a barrage of bullets.
And I'm staring at him thinking,

994
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:38,750
why is the police here?
This is strange cause he's in full metal

995
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:43,040
garb.
Helmet facemask a bulletproof armor

996
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:46,670
shooting this rifle that I've never seen
before.

997
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,150
Huh?
I don't know.

998
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,410
That sounds like a someone who saw
something.

999
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:54,290
Yeah,
very good.

1000
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:57,380
Look at it.
And then there's another video of a girl

1001
00:43:57,381 --> 00:44:00,740
saying yeah we heard shots and we're
running through the hallway and then I

1002
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:03,620
run into Nicholas crews and I looked at
him and I told him,

1003
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,540
Mike,
isn't it weird that everyone thought

1004
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:08,600
this was going to be you?
And then he just stood there and then we

1005
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:11,250
ran off cause we heard more shots.
Wow.

1006
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,830
That's th th it doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't make any sense.

1007
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,470
And that stops those details get taken
down.

1008
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,990
Those videos get taken to dive.
Video's not taking down.

1009
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,820
They've been taking them down when they
find him,

1010
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:25,130
they take,
there's this people actively taken down

1011
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,880
witness testimony that doesn't go with
the official narrative man.

1012
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:34,510
So you think that this is like a flag,
like someone shot up the school food all

1013
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:35,520
the time.

1014
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,530
That's what they do.
And then they focus on it.

1015
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:38,520
They got it.
They got bad.

1016
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:39,900
This Nicholas crews guy and they go,
oh,

1017
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:42,570
we got a perfect guy.
So they come in,

1018
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,750
they have a professional team,
they drag a nicholas crews,

1019
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,760
they do what they gotta do.
They throw him in there,

1020
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,670
arrest him and go,
we got him and then everyone buys it.

1021
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:53,370
That's what's going on in my opinion,
in my opinion.

1022
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:55,710
But this is a,
this is a crazy opinion,

1023
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:58,110
right?
Because you weren't there on the other

1024
00:44:58,111 --> 00:45:02,250
side of the country I'm sure.
But every time there's any sort of a

1025
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,710
mass event,
some horrible event,

1026
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:06,960
there's always conspiracies,
you know,

1027
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,020
because most these star,
they're like to have a,

1028
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,090
what was going on right before this was
the release of the Pfizer Document and

1029
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:15,924
conspiracy,
you know,

1030
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:18,500
and the doctor was bearing that the
five,

1031
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,520
the document was a document that trump
released and got zero zero air play from

1032
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:28,470
mainstream media.

1033
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,520
And it was a document that that showed
that

1034
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:40,130
a lot of really important people in
government from all the agencies were

1035
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:43,440
all colluding together to take down
trump.

1036
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:46,530
And there's text messages and emails.
They're going back and forth.

1037
00:45:46,531 --> 00:45:48,930
So they all work together with
Hollywood,

1038
00:45:48,931 --> 00:45:52,010
with using Hollywood.
So there's this so five's,

1039
00:45:52,011 --> 00:45:54,450
the document was about to get dropped
and everyone was saying,

1040
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,630
wait,
they're they,

1041
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,130
they're backed into a corner.
They're going to pull something off.

1042
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,750
Watch.
Here it comes.

1043
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:02,580
They're going to pull out.
There's going to be up shooting or

1044
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:03,840
something.
Wait for it.

1045
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,670
Here it comes,
and then boom.

1046
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,500
So as soon as it happened,
the reason why conspiracy theorist are

1047
00:46:08,501 --> 00:46:09,420
gone,
that's it.

1048
00:46:09,421 --> 00:46:11,310
And look at all the mistakes.
Look at,

1049
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:13,800
look at all the testimony.
That doesn't make any sense that they're

1050
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:15,950
ignoring like that.
The thing,

1051
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:20,820
the thing that gets me is there's so
many fuck ups in that shooting as a

1052
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:21,660
false flag.

1053
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,790
We're like all these,
these witness test,

1054
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:25,530
the witness testimony.
That doesn't make any sense.

1055
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,370
That to me,
I think they did it on purpose to keep

1056
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:33,200
all the conspiracy theorists busy
because there's so much shit.

1057
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:37,980
It's so cheap to keep everyone away.
That doesn't make any sense to keep

1058
00:46:37,981 --> 00:46:39,790
everybody away from the Fi's document
documentary.

1059
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,730
You know what?
It's also possible that people that were

1060
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:43,890
at that shooting,
their memories all fucked up because

1061
00:46:43,891 --> 00:46:47,100
there were so many shooting people.
That's a real thing,

1062
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,520
like that's 100% she sounded like she
didn't know what she was talking about

1063
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:53,310
then since then,
but that wasn't when the shooting was

1064
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,460
going down.
You got to see people when you see

1065
00:46:56,461 --> 00:46:58,560
people like right when they've seen some
shit,

1066
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,150
their brains scrambled.
Yeah.

1067
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,730
That's something that have to take into
consideration.

1068
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:06,060
Especially some nice lady probably never
saw anybody get shot in their lives.

1069
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:07,530
Probably never saw much violence.
Yeah.

1070
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:08,490
Maybe.
Maybe,

1071
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,870
I don't know.
There's two,

1072
00:47:09,871 --> 00:47:10,900
there's two sides of it.
There's,

1073
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,790
there's people that believe the official
story and then there's people that see

1074
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:15,331
it as,
oh,

1075
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:19,570
this was the false flag to distract from
the Pfizer document lists.

1076
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:21,270
I'm not saying that false flags don't
exist.

1077
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:25,770
I mean you and I was discussed on this
podcast in great detail is important.

1078
00:47:25,771 --> 00:47:27,510
False flag,
which is operation northwoods.

1079
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,830
Yeah.
If they're willing to do that,

1080
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,130
they're willing to do

1081
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,430
anything.
This is also the problem when we say

1082
00:47:33,431 --> 00:47:38,431
they operation northwoods was 1962.
The question is if that's how they did

1083
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:40,630
business back then,
which is what they did.

1084
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,510
I mean operation northwoods,
they were planning on attacking

1085
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,590
Guantanamo Bay with the Cuban going to
arm Cuban friendlies,

1086
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,530
have them attack Guantanamo Bay.
They can sacrifice American lives.

1087
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,590
They were going to blow up a drone.
Jetliner blame it on the Cubans.

1088
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,340
All this was to get us enthusiastic
about going to war with Cuba.

1089
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,350
They were going to sacrifice American
lives.

1090
00:47:59,351 --> 00:48:02,310
This is 100%.
They were going to lie and fake shit.

1091
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:05,140
Normal,
which was normal empires for all

1092
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:07,360
countries is just a normal false flags
are.

1093
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,790
It's nothing new.
It's been going on since the dawn of

1094
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:11,320
time.
False flags.

1095
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,750
That's old school.
The question is,

1096
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,610
and this is for the rational person
who's like,

1097
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:17,650
this is ridiculous.
You have to wonder,

1098
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,630
is that evolved?

1099
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,190
Right?
Everything evolves.

1100
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:21,960
The,
the,

1101
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,700
uh,
the way we use technology evolves,

1102
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:28,030
the way we use literature evolves,
the way we use TV evolve,

1103
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:32,140
everything evolves.
Does that evil corruption in government

1104
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:35,500
evolved to or does it just somehow or
another get snuffed out because of the

1105
00:48:35,501 --> 00:48:37,000
light?
They don't buy that.

1106
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:38,171
I don't,
I don't buy that.

1107
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:41,590
If you look at all the different things
that we've shown that there's collusion

1108
00:48:41,591 --> 00:48:43,810
in,
just look at the fact that someone like

1109
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:48,310
Hillary Clinton can run for president
while she was making hundreds of

1110
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,660
thousands of dollars giving speeches to
banks,

1111
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,150
like when she was in that debate with
Bernie Sanders and Bernie Sanders was

1112
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:54,760
like released his transcripts.
Tell us what you said.

1113
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,940
Tell us what you said to those Nice Bank
are people that give you a half a

1114
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,870
million dollars or whatever the fuck
they gave you.

1115
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,720
Like that's insane to think that some,
I was like,

1116
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:04,630
listen dude,
she is so fucking entertaining.

1117
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:07,750
We're going to give her $250,000 for an
hour.

1118
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:09,400
It's worth it.
Trust me.

1119
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:13,180
I know where in the banking business and
I know we make money with money.

1120
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:14,590
You know what I mean?
We're all about money.

1121
00:49:14,591 --> 00:49:16,900
We know the value of money.
We're in the banking business.

1122
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,440
This lady talking is worth a quarter
million dollars.

1123
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,280
It's the best.
She's going to go up there.

1124
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,650
She's going to knock your socks off.
So she's amazing.

1125
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:29,500
She's funny.
She's hilarious.

1126
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:34,660
She's amazing.
Her speech is super well and she stands

1127
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:37,810
up there on the podium and just knocks
your fucking Dick into the dirt.

1128
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:42,910
Was this Hillary Clinton gets
humiliating $7,000 less than snookie for

1129
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,000
speech at rutgers as her story grows
old.

1130
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,190
Wow.
So she got,

1131
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:52,900
she got a price slash to $25,000 I think
they're kind of thrown under the bus.

1132
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,660
Her standard fee was $200,000 per
speech,

1133
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:01,170
but some folks suggested it may be her
broken record that set the recent slash

1134
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:06,010
price of 25,000 she made so much money
off the Clinton Foundation.

1135
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,470
She's fine.
She's like,

1136
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:12,220
I'll do it for a thousand did I got
fucking 100 million from that Haiti

1137
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,590
earthquake?
Are you getting the but those people,

1138
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,720
people like her.
I think one of the things in the back of

1139
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:18,730
their head is always the potential
litigation.

1140
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:22,480
I think they're always want to stockpile
legal funds cause someone could always

1141
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:25,360
come after them.
If you stop and think about the Clinton

1142
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,210
Foundation and like,
you know,

1143
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,040
if you had 100 million and now

1144
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,120
you have,
you know,

1145
00:50:29,121 --> 00:50:30,850
75 million,
you're like,

1146
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:34,610
oh my God,
we gotta I gotta take some odd jobs that

1147
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:37,310
shit.
Do some speeches and Saudi Arabia,

1148
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:40,610
listen,
it should be illegal for someone to run

1149
00:50:40,611 --> 00:50:42,890
for president.
If someone who they could influence in a

1150
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:46,730
positive way with passing things and
signing legislature,

1151
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,610
if you pushing things forward using
their influence,

1152
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:53,210
if someone is in a position that they
could do that for a company and that

1153
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:56,180
company wants him keeping you $200,000
to talk,

1154
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,150
that's just fucking insane.
That's insane.

1155
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:01,700
That's bribery.
That's are you saying that it's worth

1156
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:04,550
$200,000 if she sucked every dick in the
room,

1157
00:51:04,551 --> 00:51:07,760
it wouldn't be worth $200,000 right.
There's no way.

1158
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,700
Who's going to pay $1,000 for a Hillary
Clinton Bro job other than for the

1159
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,370
story.
I think she didn't get a lot of money

1160
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:14,510
for blow job.
Do you think so?

1161
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,780
I think fucking alt right guys.

1162
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:22,160
A disparate fucking battle on down dude
than Devin Bu cockies.

1163
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,220
You know what I mean?
She'll do do a bit cocky for getting

1164
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,230
this.
I feel this feels like a disrespectful

1165
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:29,110
term we're taking with Hillary.
I'm sorry.

1166
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,770
As a person,
forget about it.

1167
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:32,600
As a woman,
just as a politician,

1168
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,240
no one should be,
it should just be impossible.

1169
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,490
There's enough spirasi theory that,
uh,

1170
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,220
Hillary Clinton's father,
he wrote him,

1171
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:42,630
I,
I'm assuming he's,

1172
00:51:42,631 --> 00:51:47,631
he's not alive anymore,
was a huge Jewish mob boss who is

1173
00:51:48,381 --> 00:51:52,970
responsible for
opium going into Chicago.

1174
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,790
I don't know if that's real,
but it makes sense to me.

1175
00:51:55,830 --> 00:52:00,440
It look what we know for a fact that
some politicians have run drugs before

1176
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,630
the bushes.
But here's the biggest one.

1177
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,450
The fucking Kennedy's open,
open,

1178
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:06,830
flat out.
I mean,

1179
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:09,290
it was moonshine at the time.
But guess what?

1180
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,620
That's drugs.
That's as much of a drug worse than

1181
00:52:12,621 --> 00:52:13,070
wheat.

1182
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,390
It's worse.
Way Worse.

1183
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:17,090
I mean that this how the Kennedy family
made their money.

1184
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,470
We needed a president to run marijuana.
How cool would that have Tommy Chong for

1185
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,910
president,
Jimmy Carter was like,

1186
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,640
he was just doing,
he just stuck to marijuana drug.

1187
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:27,320
John for President Tom,
he's got,

1188
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:31,430
he's got diversity on his side.
Cheech could be the running main cheech

1189
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:33,710
and Chong,
2020 guys get on it.

1190
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:35,600
I have you on the podcast support you
100%.

1191
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:39,560
If you think about all the stuff the
government was willing to do over over

1192
00:52:39,561 --> 00:52:40,130
time,
like,

1193
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:40,750
like,
you know,

1194
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:42,710
uh,
operation northwoods for instance.

1195
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,390
Uh,
they were willing to kill their own

1196
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:45,410
people.
Uh,

1197
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,240
um,
you know,

1198
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:49,310
there's a lot of corruption,
bribery,

1199
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:50,900
lot of shit in the government.
Right,

1200
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:51,823
right.
Yeah.

1201
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:55,880
If you had to equate that to one person,
you could say the u s government is kind

1202
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,110
of like John Gotti.

1203
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,030
Right,
right,

1204
00:52:58,030 --> 00:52:59,130
right.
Kinda right.

1205
00:52:59,131 --> 00:53:00,350
And you're a little bit,
a little bit,

1206
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,510
I killed some people.
Yeah,

1207
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:02,560
for sure.
It's on people.

1208
00:53:02,561 --> 00:53:04,600
If they cross him off boss.
A lot of,

1209
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,920
yeah,
a lot of scamming going on,

1210
00:53:06,921 --> 00:53:08,360
a lot of stealing.
He's Kinda,

1211
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:11,060
he's Kinda like a politician.
He's kind of like the overall,

1212
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,870
you know,
how could anybody trust anything?

1213
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,220
He would say.
Yeah.

1214
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,440
And anytime someone would say,
hey dude,

1215
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,320
like some John Gotti nerd came up,
he goes,

1216
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:21,801
dude,
you know,

1217
00:53:21,801 --> 00:53:24,410
he killed 15 people one night in my
annual,

1218
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,750
you wouldn't did,
where's the proof?

1219
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:28,740
Where's the proof?
Show me.

1220
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,940
He wouldn't say that you would go,
you believe in.

1221
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,160
And even if it wasn't true,
he's like,

1222
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,620
[inaudible] still a douchebag.
He's still a criminal.

1223
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:36,390
He's still killing people.
So yeah,

1224
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:37,920
you were wrong about that.
I was actually,

1225
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,080
you know,
traffic content and it wasn't,

1226
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,071
you know,
but still,

1227
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:41,904
you know what I mean?

1228
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,980
People just naturally,
when it comes to the government,

1229
00:53:43,981 --> 00:53:46,920
they know how corrupt they are.
They know that they're willing to kill

1230
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:49,230
their own people.
They know that the politicians aren't

1231
00:53:49,231 --> 00:53:52,230
waking up going,
how am I going to make everyone's lives

1232
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:54,330
better?
So all those speeches you here,

1233
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,870
you know them trying to like hell.
They're not thinking about helping their

1234
00:53:57,871 --> 00:54:00,210
thinking about keeping,
keeping their power.

1235
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:02,250
They're the criminals.
That's what's going on.

1236
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:06,180
So while they're in a business and this
business has criminal rules,

1237
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,180
they've allowed them to have these
criminal rules.

1238
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:12,840
It's all about how can every politician,
they're all trying to get ahold of that.

1239
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,090
That tax money.
Oh,

1240
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,320
that's the,
that's the,

1241
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:17,154
the,
the,

1242
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,070
the end game right there.
You get that tax money.

1243
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:22,800
You're never,
you could steal tax money and people

1244
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,740
were never going to come after you.
You Steel Corporation money,

1245
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:26,670
you're going to die.

1246
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,420
I didn't even get mad if he still tax
and the tax man,

1247
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,560
this has just come up with the bills.
Come up with something.

1248
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:32,940
Anything.
Just anything.

1249
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:33,470
Okay.
Uh,

1250
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:37,380
W W we this bills to,
to build a churches and uh,

1251
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:41,790
we're going to help children around the
world and we're going to find a cure for

1252
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,290
leukemia and that.
Fuck,

1253
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:44,040
yeah,
cool.

1254
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,210
Boom.
It's really easy.

1255
00:54:45,211 --> 00:54:48,060
You just gotta make up some shit.
You got to pretend that you're going to

1256
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:48,930
help people.
Oh,

1257
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:51,420
this one's the affordable housing act.
You know,

1258
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,320
we can help more people like that.
Politicians really trying to help with,

1259
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:57,750
they're trying to do is rip off tax
money.

1260
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,580
That's it.
It's all allocated.

1261
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,310
Move it,
move it to the people that they wanted

1262
00:55:01,311 --> 00:55:02,290
to have it too.
Yeah.

1263
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,080
It's a,
it's a dirty business.

1264
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,360
I'm open to it.
Then it changes and the seagulls.

1265
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:11,430
I,
I think the way we are being programmed

1266
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:13,830
in doctrinated,
I think it's genius.

1267
00:55:13,831 --> 00:55:18,600
It's working so God damn well because it
works on really smart people.

1268
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:21,090
There's intelligent people all over the
guys.

1269
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,560
Damn.
We're invested in the system.

1270
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:24,060
They,
everybody's invested in this

1271
00:55:24,061 --> 00:55:26,910
indoctrination that the school system
man,

1272
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,530
you know,
school really is designed to get your,

1273
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:34,830
take the kids from the family,
like the kids believe their teachers

1274
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,770
more than their own parents and they,
it that the state takes your kid.

1275
00:55:38,771 --> 00:55:40,440
They're there.
They're raising their kids.

1276
00:55:40,441 --> 00:55:41,670
Yeah.
It's,

1277
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,990
it's ridiculous,
man.

1278
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,560
I think most of what's going on in
schools is not that.

1279
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:50,340
I think most of it is people that are
just totally apathetic about teaching

1280
00:55:50,341 --> 00:55:52,140
people.
They don't give a fuck.

1281
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,050
Most of these people that are teaching,
they're doing it as a job.

1282
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,170
There's a lot of terrible fucking
teachers out there and they don't get

1283
00:55:58,171 --> 00:55:59,004
paid anything.

1284
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:01,710
And it's 30 conspiracy taught,
not taught.

1285
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,540
And told how to teach and what to show.
They're not like,

1286
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:06,870
okay,
just give us your own versions of

1287
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:09,540
English together with educators,
they get together to try to figure out a

1288
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:13,020
way to get people to learn these things,
but it's uninspired.

1289
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,850
That's more,
more than anything.

1290
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,390
There's no money to a conspiracy theory
is that the Rockefeller,

1291
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:23,391
John Rockefeller and Carnegie designed
the school system to slaves and to

1292
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:26,680
separate the family.
What's the conspirators career?

1293
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:29,410
The conspiracy theories they designed to
create workers,

1294
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,830
right?
People that are slaves to the system.

1295
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,050
The conspiracy theories,
they openly said,

1296
00:56:35,051 --> 00:56:39,100
we don't,
we don't need any more philosophers are

1297
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:40,900
geniuses.
We got an offer that we,

1298
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:42,790
we,
we got that and we got science right

1299
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:43,940
here.
We've got jenny sites.

1300
00:56:43,941 --> 00:56:46,630
You need come to us like w when was the
last,

1301
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,180
what was the last science?

1302
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:53,590
Great scientific discovery like in the
last 40 years that wasn't government

1303
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:54,570
funded.
Like there's,

1304
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:57,910
there's no what their,
who's funding these studies.

1305
00:56:57,911 --> 00:56:59,320
Why do you think that they're government
funded?

1306
00:56:59,321 --> 00:57:01,780
Like some new shit they come out with?
Uh,

1307
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:02,710
I don't know.
See,

1308
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:03,271
I don't know.
Yeah,

1309
00:57:03,271 --> 00:57:04,660
I don't know.
No one can name anything.

1310
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,800
I don't know what.
I mean,

1311
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:08,770
we'd have to go over some of the styles,
but I'm sure a lot of them are not

1312
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:13,150
government.
I'm assuming that most scientists are

1313
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:16,390
getting paychecks from the government.
I'm just assuming that I'm just,

1314
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,490
I'm,
I'm assuming that most scientific datas

1315
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,850
is not,
it's coming from a bunch of scientists

1316
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:26,140
who
are getting grants and they can't say

1317
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:27,460
crazy shit.
They got it.

1318
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,440
And there,
you know,

1319
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:32,280
I sent you that one email that one guy
was telling me that there,

1320
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,390
uh,
he worked for a team of scientists and

1321
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,120
they're working for pesticide company
and they're told to the go,

1322
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:41,140
we're going to do some studies here and
we want it to look like this and let's

1323
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:41,860
keep doing it.

1324
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,780
Keep doing the studies until when we
got,

1325
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,280
oh,
that's the worst they can do.

1326
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,100
That is insane.
That's insane.

1327
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,980
They keep doing study until they get the
results they want and then they don't

1328
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:53,260
publish the bad studies.
The only published the good studies and

1329
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:57,280
this is what you have done.
It seems like there's basically in a

1330
00:57:57,281 --> 00:57:59,110
nutshell,
like three kinds of science.

1331
00:57:59,111 --> 00:58:01,110
There's,
there's the sign like pseudoscience.

1332
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:04,030
It's like it's pretend science,
but for sure it's not real.

1333
00:58:04,031 --> 00:58:06,670
It's false science.
Pseudo science and then there's the

1334
00:58:06,671 --> 00:58:11,110
scientific facts like for sure
[inaudible] it's a scientific fact that

1335
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:12,970
I can get on the Internet with my
iphone.

1336
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,190
I don't need to read a study about it
and say,

1337
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:15,640
oh,
I didn't.

1338
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,380
I actually can.
I know it.

1339
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,120
My friends know it.
That's a scientific fact and other

1340
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:24,610
scientific is my car will take me to
point a to point B to point c over and

1341
00:58:24,611 --> 00:58:26,440
over and it may break down every now and
then.

1342
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:27,570
That's a fact.
That's us.

1343
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,640
The science of my car.
I believe that science,

1344
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:34,030
scientific facts and then there's a
science that you,

1345
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,040
you,
you have to take the scientist's word

1346
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:39,790
for it because there's no way that you
can verify that if you have to take,

1347
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,580
do you have to have faith in science?
That's like a religion.

1348
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,260
But scientism,
hold on a second.

1349
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,660
What are you talking about?
Like what particular kind of,

1350
00:58:46,661 --> 00:58:49,060
any kind of science,
whether it's a medical science,

1351
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,740
if you,
you have,

1352
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:55,030
you have a choice to believe in science
that you can't verify yourself.

1353
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,280
You could believe it you,
but you'll have to believe it.

1354
00:58:57,281 --> 00:58:59,620
You could say experts in the field
verify it.

1355
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,840
All the people that understood all the
bop with all the,

1356
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,850
we,
all the science that we know that though

1357
00:59:03,851 --> 00:59:05,050
had been,
has been corrupted.

1358
00:59:05,051 --> 00:59:06,280
Just the big ones.
Uh,

1359
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:07,480
sugar science,
uh,

1360
00:59:07,481 --> 00:59:09,760
tobacco science,
marijuana science,

1361
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:13,960
vaccine signs.
We know for sure all just those four

1362
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,750
that there's been a lot of corruption
and so it's hard to trust.

1363
00:59:16,751 --> 00:59:19,390
So when someone comes out and especially
the government and NGOs,

1364
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,710
yeah,
our scientists,

1365
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,070
scientists say that it's safe

1366
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,690
and effective.
You got to be like,

1367
00:59:23,691 --> 00:59:25,370
damn,
I don't know about that.

1368
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,560
I'm not going to just take your fucking
word for it.

1369
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:28,970
You know what I mean?
You guys are criminals.

1370
00:59:28,971 --> 00:59:31,010
You're John Gotti and you guys are
saying,

1371
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,840
you guys are saying that this is safe
and effective.

1372
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,870
I don't know about that.
You know,

1373
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:36,650
maybe it is.
I hope it is,

1374
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,710
but I don't know.
I don't know cause they can't prove it

1375
00:59:39,711 --> 00:59:42,380
for myself.
Oftentimes drugs that get past as being

1376
00:59:42,381 --> 00:59:46,040
safe and they turn out to not be exactly
the problem with these studies.

1377
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,140
Exactly.
This is like when we were talking about

1378
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:51,590
earlier with that,
nobody wants to discuss the idea that

1379
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:54,380
psychotropic drugs have played a part in
school shootings.

1380
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,230
The salt,
a very recent thing with human beings,

1381
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,620
the reason spike,
but they're talking about the recent

1382
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:03,290
spike in shootings,
even wet by people they know we're mass

1383
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:03,980
shooters.

1384
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,930
Those people are almost all on these
pills,

1385
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,320
but this,
these pills are very recently big.

1386
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:09,740
So when you're talking about,
yeah,

1387
01:00:09,741 --> 01:00:14,060
so when you're talking about just the
history of human beings involved in mass

1388
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:16,280
killings,
it's really recent.

1389
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,080
Craze is ramping up.
It's going crazy.

1390
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:19,580
Yeah.
Well you know what also is ramping up

1391
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,040
people taking pills.
Yeah.

1392
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,540
These things are somehow,
are they?

1393
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:26,210
They might not be the cause of it.
100% it might be society,

1394
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:30,530
it might be suppression,
it might be terrible childhood rearing.

1395
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:35,360
It might be childhood abuse in might be
all sorts of like mental health issues

1396
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:38,330
that are inherited.
All sorts of crazy diseases that people

1397
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:41,150
inherit mental diseases.
Even the vaccine pamphlets.

1398
01:00:41,151 --> 01:00:46,151
There's I think that HPV vaccine that
like girls are taking it at 10 11 and 12

1399
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:49,100
man,
that the shit that it says in the past,

1400
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:52,700
but there's not just one to one site.
Possible side effect is suicidal

1401
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:55,120
thoughts wanting to,
it's called an one,

1402
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,290
it's called impending doom.

1403
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,910
What's up?
Take your pills last night.

1404
01:00:59,911 --> 01:01:01,710
That documentary on Netflix that's been
going around.

1405
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:03,000
How is it?
It's pretty good.

1406
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:04,500
There's not a lot,
a lot.

1407
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,200
A lot of the adderall one isn't.
It is,

1408
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,110
it is,
yeah.

1409
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,030
So there's not a lot of information we
don't already know.

1410
01:01:09,031 --> 01:01:11,670
I feel like they just kind of compile it
and make it look really good.

1411
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,320
But one interesting thing that you'd
like,

1412
01:01:13,321 --> 01:01:15,030
he just brought up.
A doctor says in it,

1413
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:20,250
there's no side effects to pills.
There's just unintended benefits or non

1414
01:01:20,251 --> 01:01:22,380
benefits that you want.
They're all affects.

1415
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:25,050
There's no like side effect of like
diarrhea for instance.

1416
01:01:25,051 --> 01:01:27,900
It's an effect of the pill.
Just wasn't what you wanted.

1417
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:30,660
I see what you're saying.
Don't call it the side effect.

1418
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:32,490
An effect.
Right.

1419
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:36,280
So if he takes something and on some
people it gives suicidal thoughts.

1420
01:01:36,281 --> 01:01:38,600
It's not a side effect.
It's just an effect of taking that to

1421
01:01:38,601 --> 01:01:39,370
those people.
There's,

1422
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:44,200
there's girls wanting to kill themselves
for taking the HPV.

1423
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:47,070
That's his dad for taking acne
medication.

1424
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,690
Accutane is a big that one.
Oh,

1425
01:01:49,691 --> 01:01:51,940
do you know Andrew Santino?
Hilarious comedian.

1426
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,240
Funny Mother Fucker.
He took acutane when he was saying high

1427
01:01:55,241 --> 01:01:56,200
school.
Is that what he said?

1428
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,460
Said it was like the best thing that
ever happened to him because his face

1429
01:02:00,461 --> 01:02:02,530
totally cleared up.
But the worst thing that ever happened

1430
01:02:02,531 --> 01:02:04,750
to him in terms of like how it made them
feel like,

1431
01:02:04,751 --> 01:02:07,210
it just,
it makes me feel a lot of people get it

1432
01:02:07,211 --> 01:02:08,370
and they get suicidal thoughts.
Yeah,

1433
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,880
for sure.
See.

1434
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:11,410
So you got to ask yourself,
you know,

1435
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:12,610
even if,
whether,

1436
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:17,670
whether whether kids really are shooting
up schools or it's a false flag in there

1437
01:02:18,461 --> 01:02:20,010
setting up the kids to

1438
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,390
do it with.
That's the other side.

1439
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,480
Whatever the,
whatever the,

1440
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:28,530
the truth is there.
There's a gigantic problem with these

1441
01:02:28,531 --> 01:02:31,310
pills that are making people crazy and
no one really,

1442
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,690
this is not a big push to stop it or
anything.

1443
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,460
They're being protected there being
retired.

1444
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,460
There's a giant business in it.
There's billions of dollars.

1445
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,410
Sure.
But there's also a lot of people that

1446
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:42,870
liked those pills.
There's a lot of people that loves

1447
01:02:42,871 --> 01:02:44,760
xanax.
Like this is,

1448
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,230
again,
this is one of those things where we

1449
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:47,670
always want to look at the bad side of
it.

1450
01:02:47,671 --> 01:02:50,670
A lot of people love crack to crack
person.

1451
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,190
You could get thrown in jail for that.
Yeah,

1452
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:54,720
no,
for sure.

1453
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:59,400
But I mean people that are functional
people just how you like weed.

1454
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:01,590
I like weed.
Some people like Xanax.

1455
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,710
I'm not saying you can't have that.
It's not my opinion.

1456
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:05,580
It's not,
it's not,

1457
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,910
that's not how I feel.
What I am saying is like we need to be

1458
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:13,040
honest about the consequences of all
these things and that this is somehow or

1459
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:16,410
another left out of the equation when I
think it's a major part of the equation.

1460
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:20,280
I don't think it's the only reason why
people are shooting up schools or any of

1461
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:23,010
this shit,
but I think it absolutely must be

1462
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:26,940
playing a factor and for whatever reason
people don't want to consider that

1463
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:29,280
factor.
And I think some of it is because

1464
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:32,010
there's a lot of people out there who
liked those pills.

1465
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,320
They liked the way they feel on
antidepressants.

1466
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:36,540
They liked the way they feel on anti
anxiety medication.

1467
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:38,520
They like take an ambien before they go
to bed.

1468
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,550
They don't want to hear.
They like what it gives them.

1469
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,890
I know people who can't sleep without
ambient,

1470
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:45,450
they can't sleep without it.

1471
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:49,710
If you tried telling them that Ambien
fucks up your heart rate or does this to

1472
01:03:49,711 --> 01:03:51,240
that or you know,
make up some things.

1473
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:53,700
I don't know if it fucks up your heart
and just saying that if you started

1474
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:56,670
saying that to people they would,
they would just immediately tune out

1475
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,530
whatever dude,
I'm sleeping like a baby.

1476
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,960
You know,
it'd be a great false flag is if they

1477
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:03,630
set up another shooter and just said he
was totally stoned,

1478
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,020
you know,
that way they could reversely because of

1479
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,350
course nobody would buy the legalization
of weed of course to choke.

1480
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,190
Do you know what?
Uh,

1481
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,023
I,
um,

1482
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:14,970
what would I started smoking then
changed my mind.

1483
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,530
They have the power in the media,
ted,

1484
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:19,590
to turn it into that.
Like all of a sudden these guys are

1485
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:23,310
getting really high in Colorado and in
California we need it.

1486
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,100
We need a,
it's a joke.

1487
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,010
It's not funny.
I wouldn't work today.

1488
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:31,320
I've been smoking blunts and I would
like,

1489
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:32,131
I smoked him.
I was like,

1490
01:04:32,131 --> 01:04:33,690
okay,
now I understand rap music.

1491
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,150
Like I was like,
these rappers are so aggressive,

1492
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:37,470
but they're also high.
I'm like,

1493
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:41,310
what the fuck's going on?
It's the God damn tobacco tobacco mixed

1494
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:43,650
in with weed.
That is a different thing.

1495
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,750
That's a different animal.
It's a little too potent.

1496
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:48,600
Sometimes it's a little too woo.
It's like you're like,

1497
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:50,520
you're like,
what are we talking about?

1498
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,720
I like it every now and then.
Every now and then I like to,

1499
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,461
I like,
and I'm like,

1500
01:04:53,461 --> 01:04:55,980
you know what gives you a different kind
of head buzz?

1501
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:57,280
Well,
tobacco things,

1502
01:04:57,281 --> 01:05:01,210
yet I donald's her own,
he got me under dip when he was not a

1503
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,490
not,
I haven't done it since then,

1504
01:05:02,491 --> 01:05:03,780
but when we were in the podcast,
he did it.

1505
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:06,900
I swallowed some of it and uh,
but one thing I liked about it,

1506
01:05:06,901 --> 01:05:07,351
I was like,
oh,

1507
01:05:07,351 --> 01:05:09,090
now I get why you guys do it.
It's like,

1508
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,030
it hypes you up.
It gets you kind of like elevated,

1509
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,310
you know?
It's like you ever smoke a cigar?

1510
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,730
Maybe too.
It's a version of a cigarette.

1511
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:22,120
Like you're getting your time,
some serious fucking nicotine.

1512
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:24,160
Your system.
When you smoke a fat Stokey,

1513
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:29,350
you've got a big old fucking Hoyle de
Monterrey double corona and you're put

1514
01:05:29,351 --> 01:05:31,570
out castle style.
By the time you get to the end of that

1515
01:05:31,571 --> 01:05:33,160
thing,
your highest fuck dude.

1516
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:36,640
You're not high like you can't talk or
like you can't walk or you can't

1517
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:39,670
function,
but you're definitely feeling that

1518
01:05:39,671 --> 01:05:41,240
tobacco,
you're feel it's,

1519
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:46,250
it's doing something to your system and
they say it actually has a cognitive

1520
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:51,301
enhancing function that's similar to
nootropics and coffee as well that are

1521
01:05:51,561 --> 01:05:51,910
like it.

1522
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:56,620
It actually can make you perform better
on tests if you smoked cigarettes or if

1523
01:05:56,621 --> 01:06:00,400
you smoke a cigar and writers always say
that like I know a lot of people who

1524
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:02,500
write like writers for sitcoms and stuff
like that.

1525
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,560
Those guys always smoked cigarettes when
they write and they say they can't write

1526
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:08,620
without smoking.
Steven King said that it's like their

1527
01:06:08,621 --> 01:06:09,660
weed.
Yeah,

1528
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,980
well it,
it does have something going on men,

1529
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:14,250
but it's instead of like,
it's not,

1530
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,950
it's to me it's more like amped than it
is creative.

1531
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,880
We'd is super creative.
Weed makes me think of thoughts while I

1532
01:06:21,881 --> 01:06:24,040
write them down on my,
I can't even claim that.

1533
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,350
That's not even my thought,
but that's weeds thought.

1534
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:30,100
You know what I mean?
Like I would have never just leave me by

1535
01:06:30,101 --> 01:06:32,980
myself with no drugs in a,
in a notebook.

1536
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,510
I would've never come up with that idea.

1537
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:35,560
But the weeds like,
hey man,

1538
01:06:35,561 --> 01:06:38,230
listen to this.
You know,

1539
01:06:38,231 --> 01:06:41,290
the weed weed is way more of a,
uh,

1540
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:45,160
like an idea steroid.
I believe it,

1541
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:47,650
dude.
I see people who don't smoke weed and

1542
01:06:47,651 --> 01:06:48,540
they write and I'm like,
cool,

1543
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:53,560
you're so brave
out there out there with no helmet.

1544
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:58,000
You got no life preserver on.
And now it's crazy legal everywhere.

1545
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,660
This amazing,
this recreational weed in California.

1546
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,240
It's insane.
He just walked nine states now.

1547
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,290
Yeah.
Crazy.

1548
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:09,160
I think 18 states have league,
a legal medical and nine states have

1549
01:07:09,161 --> 01:07:10,270
legal,
recreational,

1550
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,580
nice.
Two-Cents mass.

1551
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:13,301
Yeah.
It's a wave.

1552
01:07:13,301 --> 01:07:16,480
It's going across the whole country.
It's changing everything and it's good.

1553
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:21,510
And you know what the next wave is?
MTMA MTMA therapy for PTSD patients has

1554
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,840
unprecedented results.
Maps is involved in this.

1555
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:30,460
What does it,
multiple [inaudible] Multiple

1556
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,230
Disciplinary Association for Psychedelic
studies or something like that.

1557
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,550
Maps is amazing.

1558
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:37,880
A really above board organization that,
um,

1559
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:41,920
is at the forefront of legalization of
psychedelics and of psychedelic research

1560
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:46,600
and they've been involved in studies
with soldiers and they have amazing

1561
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:49,990
results with this stuff.
Mtma just lets you forgive yourself and

1562
01:07:49,991 --> 01:07:54,180
lets you forget everything.
It reprograms your brain had reprogram,

1563
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,470
lets you forgive other people in your
life.

1564
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,700
It changes.
It could.

1565
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:02,280
One hit of MDM,
MDM and Dma,

1566
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:05,560
I that always confuses me,
molly and said it's a lot easier.

1567
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:10,570
One hit can change your taste in music
for ever,

1568
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:13,810
for ever.
I believe it because before he ever did

1569
01:08:13,811 --> 01:08:15,860
it,
the first time I did it was 1997

1570
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:21,070
and before that I was a dj at this point
and I couldn't stand techno.

1571
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:26,950
I hated techno music so much and I was a
dj and anytime a girl went on stage and

1572
01:08:27,081 --> 01:08:28,040
she was a technocrat,
I'm like,

1573
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:32,060
this is because I played drums for real.
So when you listen to techno or house,

1574
01:08:32,061 --> 01:08:36,050
it's like that's the most basic dump
chute.

1575
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:40,160
Every song,
every fucking drum beat to Sam.

1576
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:43,910
I couldn't accept it as a musician.
And most musicians feel that way about

1577
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,410
tech now.
And um,

1578
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:49,160
I went to a birthday party at the key
club in Hollywood and I walk in and

1579
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:53,900
upstairs is techno and downstairs in the
little bottom club is hip hop and it was

1580
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:55,580
a birthday party and everyone was
downstairs.

1581
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:58,340
And me and my buddy rick,
we walk in and we're standing at the

1582
01:08:58,341 --> 01:09:01,940
edge of the techno floyd and there's
like all these dudes just like dancing

1583
01:09:01,941 --> 01:09:05,330
by themselves or just like mental cases,
right.

1584
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,490
And I was just standing there looking at
him going,

1585
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:10,640
what the fuck is wrong with these
people?

1586
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:13,430
Oh my God.
So I went downstairs or playing hip hop

1587
01:09:13,431 --> 01:09:15,350
and like,
that's what I want to hear it at clubs.

1588
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:18,080
I want to hear hip hop at a club,
I want to dance with a girl,

1589
01:09:18,081 --> 01:09:19,760
not by myself,
you know,

1590
01:09:19,761 --> 01:09:23,660
so I'm downstairs and then they start
passing around some molly.

1591
01:09:23,661 --> 01:09:26,210
And so say we want to do,
and I'll never forget that that first

1592
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:27,680
one was blue.
I'm like,

1593
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:29,930
I dunno,
I dunno.

1594
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,860
So I took it.
Me and my buddy both took it and it hit

1595
01:09:33,861 --> 01:09:37,700
us that that first hit just hits you
like a fucking pile of bricks.

1596
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:42,920
We go upstairs and we're on the dance or
dancing like morons,

1597
01:09:42,921 --> 01:09:44,550
dude,
and we're looking at each other.

1598
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:45,413
Go,
you get it.

1599
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,131
I get it.
I go,

1600
01:09:46,131 --> 01:09:46,580
you'll get it.

1601
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,650
I get it.
From that point on,

1602
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,400
you got all into Trent's?
Yeah.

1603
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,250
From that point,
it wasn't just like that night.

1604
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:57,280
It changed my musical taste right in one
hit and I had a friend at the club,

1605
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,700
it was a total rnb duty,
hate a techno,

1606
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,670
and he would talk shit.
When I play tech and I got one day,

1607
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,300
you're going to do some modeling and
you're going to be all into technical.

1608
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,320
It's a fuck you.
That will never happen.

1609
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:12,650
I can't stand this music.
He starts dating the raver check like

1610
01:10:12,651 --> 01:10:14,930
six months later at the club,
some raver chick,

1611
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,900
he ends up at a ray.
He ends up dropping some molly,

1612
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:21,620
he starts coming in and bringing all
these new tech note cds and he's all

1613
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:24,770
into full blown in the transit tech.
No,

1614
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:26,410
just one hint.
This is the real,

1615
01:10:26,411 --> 01:10:26,480
real

1616
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,800
problem.
It's illegal,

1617
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,000
so when you get it from someone,
you don't know what the fuck you're

1618
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:31,840
getting.
That's the real problem with molly.

1619
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,190
This is a real problem with Mtma.
It's also the dosage.

1620
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:35,780
You don't know what the dosage is
supposed to be.

1621
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,570
Look,
you can overdose on alcohol and

1622
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:40,910
alcohol's everywhere,
but everybody knows what the dose of

1623
01:10:40,911 --> 01:10:43,550
alcohol is was.
You go to a bar and you get a shot of

1624
01:10:43,551 --> 01:10:45,500
Jack Daniels.
You know what that is?

1625
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:47,510
It's not like sometimes you get a shot
of Dac,

1626
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:49,340
Jen,
Jack Daniels in his Jack Daniels.

1627
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:53,990
Sometimes you get it in,
it's super fucking moonshine is 10 times

1628
01:10:53,991 --> 01:10:56,960
stronger and you die.
That's the problem with heroin.

1629
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:58,520
Yes.
The problem with a lot of things,

1630
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:02,180
the real problem with Mtma seems to be
that it's illegal.

1631
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:07,240
That's the real problem and what they're
finding is that there's great benefits

1632
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:08,540
if it's used correctly.

1633
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:10,100
I mean,
anything can be abused,

1634
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:13,320
but that doesn't mean we should make it
illegal and what they want to do.

1635
01:11:13,321 --> 01:11:16,860
I think their,
their timeline is somewhere around 2021

1636
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:20,190
making it legal for,
for therapy.

1637
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:23,190
It's going to change the world.
It's going to change everything.

1638
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:26,640
It's gonna change the way people feel
about the past is going to change the

1639
01:11:26,641 --> 01:11:29,820
way people interact with each other.
You're going to know just by people's

1640
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:31,480
behavior whether or not they've ever
done it right.

1641
01:11:31,481 --> 01:11:34,140
You know where it comes from,
where MTMA comes from?

1642
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:38,580
Well that's the part of it.
The act of ingredient that takes you a,

1643
01:11:38,581 --> 01:11:40,740
that just plant,
right?

1644
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,780
Where's that plan at the of Thailand.
Crazy wars over Thailand or

1645
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:50,160
Cambodia in Cambodia.
It's like the bark,

1646
01:11:50,161 --> 01:11:53,100
like the,
something about the like the root of a

1647
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:54,480
tree trunk or something.
Yeah.

1648
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,760
So it has something to do with a tree,
James pulling it up,

1649
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,890
but it becomes very dangerous for those
people.

1650
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:00,960
Right?
Like all that the trafficking becomes

1651
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:01,860
crazies.
Yeah.

1652
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:05,340
They fuck up for us.
Like for us being chopped down of just,

1653
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:07,710
just for the people being murdered.
It's like,

1654
01:12:07,711 --> 01:12:09,790
it's heavy duty stuff.
Sassafras.

1655
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:11,453
Um,
I dunno,

1656
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:14,130
I googled it and just look at images and
that's what's popping up.

1657
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:18,060
Maybe it was a place Mtma Cambodia
trees.

1658
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,280
Bars.
Sassafras.

1659
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:22,530
Okay.
Maybe that is Sassafras and SEF.

1660
01:12:22,531 --> 01:12:24,330
Rolly Sassafras.
Yeah,

1661
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,090
I guess it Sassafras Dude.
It's a whatever,

1662
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:30,570
whatever that plan is.
They take the see if that just google

1663
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:31,860
vice,
uh,

1664
01:12:31,861 --> 01:12:34,440
the making of ecstasy,
cause I'm pretty sure vice to this.

1665
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:38,760
But could you go with that please?
I think a vice had a special on that.

1666
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,210
I wonder what would happen if he just
ate it raw.

1667
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:44,730
I wonder,
can you do that?

1668
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:47,610
Okay.

1669
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:48,840
Um,
is there a special,

1670
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:51,303
what does it say?

1671
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:55,080
The truth about ecstasy?
Yeah.

1672
01:12:55,081 --> 01:12:58,930
So there's,
there's some sort of a vice episode

1673
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,910
where they grow this stuff anyway.
Um,

1674
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:06,640
this should be something that's not
distributed by criminals were in ski

1675
01:13:06,641 --> 01:13:09,760
masks like you've seen in this video
should be something distributed by

1676
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:12,790
stores and they should be doctors.
And if you wanted it,

1677
01:13:12,791 --> 01:13:15,420
you could have a rave where you even
have medical centers in the rave.

1678
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:20,421
We keep people from overdosing the
transitionary period from people going

1679
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:24,040
from drugs being totally illegal to some
drugs,

1680
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:25,840
having massive benefits.
Like if you're,

1681
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,070
you go to a club,
right?

1682
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,650
And everyone,
there's,

1683
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:29,620
c'mon,
we're doing shots,

1684
01:13:29,621 --> 01:13:31,570
were doing shots,
the whole fucking bars getting wasted

1685
01:13:31,571 --> 01:13:33,190
and drunk.
Everybody's fine with that.

1686
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:36,490
But you're not fine with a club where
everybody does a small amount of

1687
01:13:36,491 --> 01:13:37,470
ecstasy.
Well,

1688
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,890
why can't you do that?
Well,

1689
01:13:38,891 --> 01:13:39,701
that's drugs.
Well,

1690
01:13:39,701 --> 01:13:40,660
the other one's drugs too.

1691
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:43,990
He just used to those drugs.
Once we get past that hurdle,

1692
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,930
and it might take a whole generation
before people get used to places where

1693
01:13:46,931 --> 01:13:48,790
you can go,
one drug gets you violent,

1694
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:51,910
one drug makes you want to have sex.
So listen,

1695
01:13:51,911 --> 01:13:53,860
you're not going to stop that drug.
Here's my point.

1696
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:56,320
It's a powerful,
really useful drug.

1697
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:58,750
People going to find out about it.
It's an amazing experience.

1698
01:13:58,751 --> 01:14:01,450
They're going to do it.
So what's the best way to handle that?

1699
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:04,120
Best way to handle is make it safe,
make it legal,

1700
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:07,930
make it regulated so they know what
actually is in each one of these fucking

1701
01:14:07,931 --> 01:14:10,150
pills.
You're not getting it from some pimp or

1702
01:14:10,151 --> 01:14:13,660
some asshole or some fucking crazy dude
is stuffed in a balloon.

1703
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:16,390
Put it up his ass hole and made it
across the border with it.

1704
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,100
You don't know where the fuck you're
getting this stuff.

1705
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:22,240
All sorts of shit.
Amphetamines and all sorts of crazy

1706
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:23,860
shit.
And people die from it because they

1707
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:25,810
don't know what the fuck is in there.
Here it is.

1708
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,540
Yeah.
Um,

1709
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,830
okay.
It says more a boy,

1710
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:34,750
Mr Mode a h p.
R e w p.

1711
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:36,490
H n.
O.

1712
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:36,850
M.
Trees.

1713
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:41,220
Murray proved pericom trees in Cambodia
and the,

1714
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:43,420
they're found in Cambodia's Oh,
Sassafras.

1715
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,090
The factory has been set up to distill,
sacrificed oil,

1716
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:48,400
uh,
processed by boiling the roots and the

1717
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:51,250
trunk of the exceptionally rare plant.
Oh,

1718
01:14:51,251 --> 01:14:54,190
they're really rare trees to wow.
How crazy is that?

1719
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:56,650
How many of these fucking trees or like
in the middle of the rain forest and we

1720
01:14:56,651 --> 01:14:58,030
don't know about,
you know,

1721
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:59,110
I mean,
there's some,

1722
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:01,510
there's gotta be some shit where they
haven't tapped into it yet.

1723
01:15:01,511 --> 01:15:04,920
They're finding all sorts of different
pharmaceutical drugs that they can

1724
01:15:04,921 --> 01:15:06,380
cocked out of stuff.

1725
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,140
The transplants,
they buy Amazon.

1726
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,660
Yeah.
They find all the

1727
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:16,320
insects are evolving so fast and the
Amazon that they only have names for I

1728
01:15:16,331 --> 01:15:21,331
think 90% 10% of the insects,
90% they have no names.

1729
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:22,270
No,
it's crazy.

1730
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:24,070
Is that true?
They have all sorts of bugs and the

1731
01:15:24,071 --> 01:15:25,660
Amazon for sure that they have an
identified,

1732
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,970
they know that for a fact and they do
evolve.

1733
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:31,910
They're rare thing where you can,
there's like some primitive life forms

1734
01:15:31,911 --> 01:15:33,700
that you could find that didn't exist
before.

1735
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,930
Like they found this crayfish,
I think it's in India or Europe,

1736
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:41,680
maybe Europe,
crayfish that produces by cloning.

1737
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,210
They don't have sex.
So female,

1738
01:15:44,211 --> 01:15:47,400
they're all female and one crayfish just
makes a bunch of other babies.

1739
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:50,740
It just makes babies just need sex.
And they're like,

1740
01:15:50,741 --> 01:15:53,500
what the fuck?
I mean obviously there's no genetic

1741
01:15:53,501 --> 01:15:54,820
diversity.
Right.

1742
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,870
Cause they obviously would need a male
DNA.

1743
01:15:57,890 --> 01:15:59,590
It makes it the female DNA.
There it is.

1744
01:15:59,591 --> 01:16:02,080
Mute and crayfish clones itself and it's
taking over Europe.

1745
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:07,620
So this crayfish doesn't fuck,
they just reproduce like one crayfish

1746
01:16:08,111 --> 01:16:10,960
could just reproduce.
It's really bananas.

1747
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:13,900
So this is a new thing that didn't exist
25 years ago.

1748
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:17,710
This is something that they're very sure
wasn't a,

1749
01:16:17,711 --> 01:16:21,100
a living organism up until recently.
Here's the good thing.

1750
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,310
Crayfish are delicious.
People are starving to death.

1751
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:26,920
Now they've got some mother fuckers that
all you have to do is just throw some

1752
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:28,210
stuff in there.
You don't have to count on them.

1753
01:16:28,211 --> 01:16:30,610
Fucking,
maybe it's the same stuff that made the

1754
01:16:30,611 --> 01:16:32,860
frogs gay.
Could be,

1755
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,550
could be bro.
Maybe it's linked.

1756
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,840
Could be,
but if you,

1757
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:38,650
I mean it could be,
could be pesticides,

1758
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,513
it could be.
Um,

1759
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,560
look,
there's another thing about the amount

1760
01:16:41,561 --> 01:16:44,860
of people that flush pills down the
toilet and how much that shit goes to

1761
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:46,790
water treatment plants and into,
um,

1762
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,080
aqueducts and reservoirs and shit.

1763
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:53,470
Yeah.
There's a lot of pills that get flushed

1764
01:16:53,471 --> 01:16:56,140
down our toilets and some of them make
it into rivers and shit.

1765
01:16:56,141 --> 01:16:59,020
Some of them making it to the ocean.
You know what's supposed to be

1766
01:16:59,021 --> 01:17:01,150
particularly bad.
I never thought about this until a

1767
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:03,850
friend of mine who was a surfer told me
he was a yoga teacher,

1768
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:07,210
was a surfer and said nobody told him
and he got real sick cause he went into

1769
01:17:07,211 --> 01:17:10,910
the ocean right after the rain.
You can't go to the ocean after the rain

1770
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,210
because when it rains in La,
all that bullshit,

1771
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:19,360
all the chemicals and toxins and
cleaners and oil and gasoline and

1772
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:23,240
plastic washes into the water like right
at the shore.

1773
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:26,870
And that's where it's all just swashing
around in there with the waves and you

1774
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:30,860
get in there and you get sick as fuck.
You're basically getting poisoned.

1775
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:36,020
Is there some kind of filtration system
before they just let all the water just

1776
01:17:36,021 --> 01:17:38,240
run right and right is right from the
streets,

1777
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:41,950
from the runoff just from the streets.
I think it,

1778
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:45,170
where does the toilet water go?
Does that water goes through a sewage

1779
01:17:45,171 --> 01:17:48,740
system that goes through a sanitation
system.

1780
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:51,140
But sometimes those break,
I was uh,

1781
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:54,650
at the Charles River in Boston once and
it was a,

1782
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:57,380
it was like right across the street from
where I lived and I'd hang out there all

1783
01:17:57,381 --> 01:18:00,920
the time when I was a kid and I was
standing there on the shore and I saw

1784
01:18:00,921 --> 01:18:04,940
these bubbles and like these chunks of
things floating up to the water.

1785
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,590
And I was like,
what the fuck is that?

1786
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:10,250
And then I saw condom bloke come up and
I went,

1787
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:13,450
ah,
that's a sewer pipe death,

1788
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:17,600
flushing condoms and like shit and
condom water.

1789
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,740
It's coming right through the fucking
ground into this river where all these

1790
01:18:21,741 --> 01:18:23,930
fish lift,
these fish are probably living off a

1791
01:18:23,931 --> 01:18:27,320
human shit.
What's the water like after the s the

1792
01:18:27,321 --> 01:18:29,630
sewage water runs through the filtration
system.

1793
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:31,700
What does that water perfect and where
does it go?

1794
01:18:31,701 --> 01:18:36,590
Fiji puddles that does it go into 99 to
99 for eight ounces.

1795
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:42,080
Based on what I saw online,
it seems like Fiji water is the best

1796
01:18:42,081 --> 01:18:43,310
water out there.
Like they took,

1797
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:48,170
they tested a lot of bottled water and,
and a lot of bottled water has a lot of

1798
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,760
bullshit in it.
Look at this.

1799
01:18:49,761 --> 01:18:52,220
After 50 years,
Boston's Charles River just became

1800
01:18:52,221 --> 01:18:56,060
swimmable again.
Took $500 million in nearly two decades

1801
01:18:56,061 --> 01:18:58,100
of work.
Here's how the city did it.

1802
01:18:58,130 --> 01:18:59,000
That's it,
man.

1803
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:02,450
That was the river that's connected to
over that river.

1804
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:04,100
Went all the way down near my house.

1805
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,700
Why would you say the polluted people
are gross?

1806
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:08,481
Well,
dude,

1807
01:19:08,481 --> 01:19:11,540
when and people started building shit in
the 18 hundreds it didn't give a fuck

1808
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:14,350
about the future.
They took that sewer pipe and just lay

1809
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:17,300
it right there,
pop it right into the fucking ocean.

1810
01:19:17,301 --> 01:19:19,010
I'm gonna take a shit right in that
water.

1811
01:19:19,011 --> 01:19:22,490
It's going to go shooting down at pipe
and drop right in a fish's head.

1812
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:24,260
Who Cares?
They didn't give a fuck when they were

1813
01:19:24,261 --> 01:19:26,600
building things.
They would have all their industrial

1814
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:28,400
runoff just go right into rivers.
They taught,

1815
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,940
they polluted thousands of rivers.
Like who the fuck knows how many fish

1816
01:19:31,941 --> 01:19:34,160
died?
Because people in the early days of the

1817
01:19:34,161 --> 01:19:36,200
industrial revolution were fucking
assholes.

1818
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,030
They didn't have any consequences.
They didn't,

1819
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:41,870
they didn't think about the possibility
of completely destroying the

1820
01:19:41,871 --> 01:19:44,630
environment.
Like that didn't exist before the age of

1821
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:47,510
the industrial machines.
The only time it existed before that was

1822
01:19:47,511 --> 01:19:51,920
in dead bodies would,
would pollute rivers systems after war.

1823
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,940
You know,
like when people would throw bodies into

1824
01:19:55,941 --> 01:19:57,680
rivers like that would,
you know,

1825
01:19:57,681 --> 01:20:00,590
that would fuck up people's wells that
would fuck up.

1826
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,221
Uh,
you know,

1827
01:20:01,221 --> 01:20:02,840
any drinking.
What people got real sick.

1828
01:20:02,841 --> 01:20:04,210
How did king's Shit,
well,

1829
01:20:04,211 --> 01:20:07,890
what did their toilets look like?
Like back in the 1,516 it was like some

1830
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:08,110
dude

1831
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:09,540
the his mouth.
Yeah,

1832
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:12,110
you're exactly right.
I don't have shit right.

1833
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:15,540
Dab Pimp ass toilets for the kings back
in the day.

1834
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:17,820
I'm sure they did.
Once you google it,

1835
01:20:17,821 --> 01:20:22,821
Jamie Google's toilet toilet from King
Henry the eighth that King Henry the go

1836
01:20:24,001 --> 01:20:24,990
killed all his wives,
right?

1837
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:27,200
Toilets from all the way back in the
bcs.

1838
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:29,750
But I'm going to go to more resemble
King Henry.

1839
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,040
A's got tired of those ladies just cut
their fucking heads off.

1840
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:35,750
A king's loaf go to.
Where does it lead to?

1841
01:20:35,751 --> 01:20:38,820
Suspected by by doctors.
They want to make sure it's got enough

1842
01:20:38,821 --> 01:20:42,270
fiber in his diet.
Keep His highness alive.

1843
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:45,030
Where did the changes?
She would just find Jamie,

1844
01:20:45,031 --> 01:20:47,610
what's that face called?
A thunder mug.

1845
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:48,870
Oh,
nice.

1846
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,870
Pull that up.
Here we go.

1847
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,090
Hold on.
Make sure.

1848
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,001
Oh,
okay.

1849
01:20:54,001 --> 01:20:57,240
This is a for the 16 hundreds that's
what he shit into.

1850
01:20:57,810 --> 01:21:00,870
That's why I say is this is a
shakespearian chamber pot,

1851
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:05,900
not the bards own thunder Mug,
but it is a typical chamber pot and

1852
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:07,500
that's what they would call them chamber
pots.

1853
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:12,360
So it's a potty shit in like literally
shit in a pot that looks sturdy.

1854
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:14,880
The,
so it's really like a toilet bowl.

1855
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:17,400
It's like a toilet bowl.
It just doesn't have water in it.

1856
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:20,490
Do you think they've left water in it to
make it easier to clean up next to it?

1857
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,400
Probably smarter to have water in there.
So you plop in the water?

1858
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:26,060
Yeah.
Otherwise you get a couple of slaves and

1859
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:27,410
pull it out.
Dumping your good luck.

1860
01:21:27,411 --> 01:21:31,230
If you ever have to take a shit on a
plane and you see how little water there

1861
01:21:31,231 --> 01:21:33,810
is and that little thing that you drop
in logs into,

1862
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:35,850
and then when you flush it never gets it
all,

1863
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:37,800
you know,
and you've got to think,

1864
01:21:37,801 --> 01:21:39,990
do I just like play stupid and get Outta
here?

1865
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:44,280
I gotta give a courtesy flush.
American revolution is a hole in the

1866
01:21:44,281 --> 01:21:46,410
ground.
Nice magic fallen into that hole.

1867
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:48,960
That's your death.
You choked to death on shit.

1868
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:51,390
It's happened.
100% happen.

1869
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,790
Tapping,
I read about a dude who fell into a

1870
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:57,270
septic tank.
The felony has septic tank and drown had

1871
01:21:57,271 --> 01:22:01,680
a septic tank in his backyard and he was
fixing it somehow or another and it

1872
01:22:01,681 --> 01:22:06,510
broke a fell through and he dragged in a
fucking septic tank.

1873
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,210
How did they get rid of their shit in
the city?

1874
01:22:09,211 --> 01:22:12,270
Just regular peasants.
Like what did they just around in the

1875
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:15,710
streets or did they have to collect it
and drag it out to the woods to,

1876
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,920
good question.
Well,

1877
01:22:16,921 --> 01:22:18,280
there was a real issue,
uh,

1878
01:22:18,281 --> 01:22:21,660
in Rome in the early days of people
shitting in the streets.

1879
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:26,160
And apparently there's a lot of people
in San Francisco right now that a

1880
01:22:26,161 --> 01:22:27,180
shitting in the streets.

1881
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:29,370
It's a real issue.
Jake shields,

1882
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,280
my friend,
uh,

1883
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:32,320
the MMA fighter,
um,

1884
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:34,140
Jujitsu master,
jake shields,

1885
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:37,560
you know,
of course he put a video up on instagram

1886
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:41,130
of some dudes shitting,
like pulling his pants down and like

1887
01:22:41,131 --> 01:22:43,260
shitting right into the street.
Like you said,

1888
01:22:43,261 --> 01:22:46,650
it's happening everywhere.
San Francisco has done an amazing amount

1889
01:22:46,651 --> 01:22:48,360
of bombs.
I think it was jake shields.

1890
01:22:48,361 --> 01:22:51,330
I don't want to speak out of turn.
Pretty sure it was just the best city

1891
01:22:51,331 --> 01:22:53,670
for homeless people for sure.
They let people do whatever the fuck

1892
01:22:53,671 --> 01:22:55,620
they want and that city,
there's so nice.

1893
01:22:55,830 --> 01:23:00,000
It's so open minded and they feel so
guilty because they made $1 billion from

1894
01:23:00,001 --> 01:23:02,370
like brazzers.com or some shit,
you know,

1895
01:23:02,371 --> 01:23:04,440
they take the bait,
all that tech money,

1896
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:05,980
you know,
like it's different kind of

1897
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,340
money there.
They're so liberal in comparison to like

1898
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:13,590
Wall Street banker type dudes.
Those dudes are like cut throat,

1899
01:23:13,591 --> 01:23:16,090
right wing,
like private jet.

1900
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:19,080
Fuck you Minko big watch.
Go cow,

1901
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:23,500
cow doing coke.
Whereas the money on the other side,

1902
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:25,000
like the tech money,
they're all like,

1903
01:23:25,001 --> 01:23:26,890
well diversity is really important.
And,

1904
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:30,040
and women,
they need to be represented in tech and

1905
01:23:30,041 --> 01:23:32,920
this is their space.
This is the space for them to,

1906
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:35,230
we need to let them know,
we need to encourage that.

1907
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:38,770
Like there's so left way,
if they're like these homeless people,

1908
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,350
they also be,
just because they don't have an address

1909
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:43,990
doesn't mean this city is not equally.
There's,

1910
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:47,290
you know,
we have to help them and offer aid

1911
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:51,580
crackheads just taking diarrhea,
splatter shifts against walls.

1912
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:54,050
I think they just let these people get
away with,

1913
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:58,000
they were fucking mentally ill people
and they just let them wander around

1914
01:23:58,001 --> 01:23:59,770
through their streets cause they really
cared.

1915
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:01,480
You know what they would do,
they would,

1916
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:04,480
uh,
really put some money into taking care

1917
01:24:04,481 --> 01:24:06,430
of these people.
So just letting them wander around the

1918
01:24:06,431 --> 01:24:07,540
streets,
shitting all over the place.

1919
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:10,630
Have a place where you can get them
clothes from the salvation army or

1920
01:24:10,631 --> 01:24:12,220
something like that.
Have a place where you'd give him

1921
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:15,250
regular showers,
have something that's like appealing

1922
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:18,340
they can go to all the time.
So you keep them from just shitting on

1923
01:24:18,341 --> 01:24:20,680
the streets in front of everybody.
Like that's crazy.

1924
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:26,040
Billy Corgan had a residency in San
Francisco of up maybe eight years ago

1925
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:30,130
and uh,
it was all about him just writing songs

1926
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:33,610
on the spot and then going on stage that
night and doing brand new songs.

1927
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:38,611
I could weird kind of residency.
And he had this one song that he wrote

1928
01:24:38,651 --> 01:24:40,760
about,
he just hanging out in the park in San

1929
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:45,520
Francisco and just wrote about the bums
and how disgusting it all was and called

1930
01:24:45,521 --> 01:24:46,720
the song peace and love.

1931
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,120
Excellent song.
One of his greatest songs.

1932
01:24:49,121 --> 01:24:51,490
It's deep.
It's about the bums.

1933
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:55,060
There's so many men.
We used to run into him all the time.

1934
01:24:55,061 --> 01:24:58,120
When we did gigs in San Francisco,
we'd go out to eat and you'd have to do

1935
01:24:58,121 --> 01:25:02,470
like this bomb obstacle course on the
way to the restaurant.

1936
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:03,820
Oh,
here comes wanting to get across the

1937
01:25:03,821 --> 01:25:04,541
street.
Oh No,

1938
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:04,721
no,
no.

1939
01:25:04,721 --> 01:25:05,500
I don't have any money,
bro.

1940
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,630
They're super aggressive tests.
Yes.

1941
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:09,520
People were real tolerant there.
Yeah,

1942
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:12,340
but isn't that better?
That's better than the opposite.

1943
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:13,120
It's better.
That's,

1944
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,640
I think it's good to live in a place
that this tolerance as possible.

1945
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:20,641
Even if the super lefties get annoying,
you don't want the opposite to see they

1946
01:25:20,831 --> 01:25:24,880
might fuck up because there's the same
sort of mentality that goes on with

1947
01:25:24,881 --> 01:25:28,480
people on the far left and people on the
far right and that mentality is my way's

1948
01:25:28,481 --> 01:25:29,110
the right way.

1949
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:30,130
I'm right.
You're wrong.

1950
01:25:30,131 --> 01:25:32,140
Fuck you.
I'm going to make you change.

1951
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,030
I'm going to make you do what and that
doesn't work.

1952
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:37,870
That doesn't work on anybody,
but I always feel like it's safer and

1953
01:25:37,871 --> 01:25:42,871
better when that's happening towards
like kindness and compassion and income

1954
01:25:43,181 --> 01:25:47,020
equality and all these things that are,
I see like even though it gets very

1955
01:25:47,021 --> 01:25:50,890
authoritarian,
I see that at least it has like a good

1956
01:25:50,891 --> 01:25:53,530
heart to it all.
Like even if it's misguided,

1957
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,470
some of it's missing,
some is misguided or even if they're

1958
01:25:56,471 --> 01:25:58,690
pretending did,
there's always that.

1959
01:25:58,930 --> 01:25:59,890
That's a good move.
Right?

1960
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:02,380
If you're going to pretend you pretend
towards the left,

1961
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,190
yeah,
she was some money.

1962
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:07,250
Yeah,
you could steal all sorts of tax money.

1963
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:08,084
Just pretend.
Yeah,

1964
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:10,460
you're helping people.
There's definitely a lot of that going

1965
01:26:10,461 --> 01:26:11,780
on.
There's no doubt about that.

1966
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:13,370
Dude.
We haven't talked about Tony Ferguson.

1967
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:14,760
It's two o'clock.
Yeah,

1968
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:17,810
this is the kind of just walk already.
Holy Shit.

1969
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,160
We ramble down.
Um,

1970
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:22,640
we have to talk about Tony Ferguson,
seeing as how you,

1971
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:25,700
his Jujitsu coach.
And I was fucking convinced.

1972
01:26:25,701 --> 01:26:27,770
I told Jamie,
I told Jimmy Smith,

1973
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:28,790
I'm like,
I'm not buying it.

1974
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,670
I'm not buying it.
It's April fools.

1975
01:26:30,671 --> 01:26:33,110
The Shit's coming on April fools.
Fuck you man.

1976
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:36,830
Yo fool me once.
Shame on you fool me 50 times or how

1977
01:26:36,831 --> 01:26:38,470
many times have been busted by April
fools?

1978
01:26:38,471 --> 01:26:39,740
Mike,
There's no fucking way.

1979
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:42,530
Tony Ferguson got hurt a week before the
fight.

1980
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,620
There's no way.
Yeah,

1981
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,470
and it's true.
That's the first thing I thought.

1982
01:26:45,471 --> 01:26:46,041
I'm like,
oh my God,

1983
01:26:46,041 --> 01:26:47,810
everyone's going to think this is April
fools.

1984
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:49,040
This Dana says,
yeah,

1985
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:50,570
everyone's,
no one's going to believe this.

1986
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:55,480
Can I found out,
uh,

1987
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:57,590
late Saturday night,
you know,

1988
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,390
I'm in the studio with Danny loan or
just making some music and,

1989
01:27:01,391 --> 01:27:03,490
um,
you know,

1990
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,740
I knew something,
something might have been wrong because

1991
01:27:09,741 --> 01:27:14,180
we were supposed to work Saturday
afternoon and,

1992
01:27:14,181 --> 01:27:15,014
um,

1993
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:20,450
he never no shows.
He's late a lot,

1994
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,180
but he was late and I'm just hanging out
in front of a studio.

1995
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:27,680
He's got his own gym now and after
awhile he didn't return his tax.

1996
01:27:27,681 --> 01:27:29,090
I'm like something,
you know,

1997
01:27:29,091 --> 01:27:31,640
he's,
he's a fucking superstar.

1998
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:33,350
There's a lot of shit going on inside.
You said,

1999
01:27:33,351 --> 01:27:34,550
okay,
fuck it is,

2000
01:27:34,551 --> 01:27:38,750
I laughed and went on with my day,
went in the studio and then I get the

2001
01:27:38,751 --> 01:27:40,190
tax.
I can 11,

2002
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:42,320
25 at night,
Saturday night.

2003
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,270
He said,
I fucked up.

2004
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:47,010
I fucked up my knee.
Uh,

2005
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:49,820
blew my fucking alcl out.
Um,

2006
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:52,340
he wants to fight,
he wants to fight.

2007
01:27:52,341 --> 01:27:53,420
He does not,
he did not,

2008
01:27:53,421 --> 01:27:55,070
not want to fight,
but his doctor said,

2009
01:27:55,071 --> 01:27:56,660
you can't fight.
And he was like,

2010
01:27:56,661 --> 01:27:59,540
I need a second opinion.
So he went to the UFC doctors and they

2011
01:27:59,541 --> 01:27:59,960
said,
nope,

2012
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:04,130
you can't fight his lcls detached from
his knee according to,

2013
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,660
so it's pulled from the bone.

2014
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,090
It's pulled off the boat.
Yeah,

2015
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:08,270
that's what they said.
It's really,

2016
01:28:08,271 --> 01:28:10,430
it's,
it's not like usually you tell Dana

2017
01:28:10,431 --> 01:28:11,061
described it.
Yeah.

2018
01:28:11,061 --> 01:28:14,360
Usually you tear your lcl,
MCL usually cause I've,

2019
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:18,410
I've done my mcl before.
It repairs on its own so thick according

2020
01:28:18,411 --> 01:28:20,750
to what the doctors tell me.
I don't know shit,

2021
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:23,510
but they're uh,
you know,

2022
01:28:23,511 --> 01:28:26,330
but you need to tell your meniscus.
You probably need surgery for that or

2023
01:28:26,331 --> 01:28:28,820
you tear your acl,
you for sure need surgery for that.

2024
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:29,681
Um,
if it's,

2025
01:28:29,681 --> 01:28:31,040
if it's,
if it's a complete terror,

2026
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:34,440
but the lcl and the MCL,
the only time there they,

2027
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:36,290
again,
according to what I hear,

2028
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:39,620
the only time we need surgery is if it's
fucking blown the fuck out.

2029
01:28:39,621 --> 01:28:44,260
Like motorcycle acts,
acts freak things and uh,

2030
01:28:45,130 --> 01:28:45,360
okay.

2031
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,030
When I say Tony wanted to fight,
he,

2032
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:49,770
he would have fought with that shit.
He didn't give a fuck.

2033
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:51,690
They wouldn't let him fight.
He wanted a fight.

2034
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,550
Was He walking with sunglasses on?
Indoors?

2035
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:57,010
I don't know.
I don't know what he was wearing.

2036
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,110
This is what Dana,
Dana was saying.

2037
01:28:59,111 --> 01:29:02,250
I think said he,
he tripped over some wires.

2038
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:03,430
Some,
you know those,

2039
01:29:03,890 --> 01:29:05,960
those thick cables that they lay down.
Yeah.

2040
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,900
Apparently tripped over the water and
fell.

2041
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:08,790
Fuck,
fuck.

2042
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,670
That's insane.
It's the craziest thing ever.

2043
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,380
It's insane.
It's so crazy.

2044
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:16,020
It's so sad that fight.
It's doomed.

2045
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:19,920
Dana White said he would never put that
fight on again.

2046
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:20,970
I'm like,
are you crazy?

2047
01:29:20,971 --> 01:29:24,330
Book that Shit again.
The thing that sucks is the thing that

2048
01:29:24,331 --> 01:29:27,800
sucks is a four is a magic number.
Dana said in an interview,

2049
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:30,160
kind of hinted at or alluded to the fact
May,

2050
01:29:30,161 --> 01:29:31,650
I hope I'm wrong,
I hope I'm wrong,

2051
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:35,790
but that they would,
they're going to strip tony of his

2052
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:38,730
interim belt like,
you know Robert Whitaker's.

2053
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:39,593
Where'd you see that?

2054
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:43,470
Um,
someone told me I didn't hear it,

2055
01:29:43,471 --> 01:29:44,850
so that's why I'm saying,
I don't know if it's true.

2056
01:29:44,851 --> 01:29:45,511
Someone said,
yeah,

2057
01:29:45,511 --> 01:29:46,800
David,
he just did an interview and he,

2058
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:49,980
he was,
he was a hinton like oil.

2059
01:29:49,981 --> 01:29:54,270
He said it and sell it in such a way
that Tony is going to get stripped of

2060
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:55,104
his belt.
And I,

2061
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:56,610
and I thought,
that's ridiculous.

2062
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:59,010
Here's my question.
If someone is the champ,

2063
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:01,350
right,
and they get injured and they can't

2064
01:30:01,351 --> 01:30:03,330
defend their title,
then they have an interim title.

2065
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:06,510
Right?
But if the interim guy gets injured and

2066
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:09,630
can't defend the interim title,
do they strip the end?

2067
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:11,970
Is that ever happened?
Robert Whittaker,

2068
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,890
he loses interim lightweight title when
number grumet often hallway square off.

2069
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:20,310
So I guess they're taking the time.
They didn't do that.

2070
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:21,780
I mean,
they didn't do that to Robert Whitaker.

2071
01:30:21,781 --> 01:30:23,400
He was the interim interim champion.

2072
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,820
Should they have an interim interim?
No,

2073
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,090
I dunno man.
But um,

2074
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:32,790
it doesn't seem like they let the
whitaker take 11 months off to recover.

2075
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:36,450
Why would they do the exact same thing?
It was the exact same situation.

2076
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:40,830
Robert Whitaker was fighting
for the interim,

2077
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:43,230
or he had the interim title.
He was going to fight,

2078
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,090
I forget who it was.
It was either,

2079
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,470
I forget who it was.
And then he got injured.

2080
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:52,680
They didn't strip him right.
Why they strip Antonio.

2081
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:57,210
Do you feel like it's punishment for him
getting injured a week out?

2082
01:30:57,211 --> 01:30:59,340
Like they're pissed and like fuck it
stripped them?

2083
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,360
Yeah.
I don't know.

2084
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,140
I don't know.
But uh,

2085
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,590
that's,
you can't do that so.

2086
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:05,250
Right.
I mean he got heat.

2087
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,560
Did Tony wanted to fight more than
anybody?

2088
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:12,000
We've got to buy what you do.
Like if he happens four weeks ago and

2089
01:31:12,001 --> 01:31:15,120
it's an injury and training and he tears
it from the bone,

2090
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:18,240
is that they just rescheduled the fight,
right?

2091
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:20,760
Yeah.
And it's still for the interim title.

2092
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,670
Why is it like a week out the interim is
canceled?

2093
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:28,820
Maybe it's because they have to make a
big fight with Max Holloway versus could

2094
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:33,060
be before the world.
They have like that cost that cost Tony

2095
01:31:33,061 --> 01:31:35,550
a lot of money because he has the
interim belt.

2096
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:37,890
He,
he was,

2097
01:31:37,891 --> 01:31:41,190
this was going to be by far is the
biggest pay day ever for him.

2098
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:43,110
I mean,
he was making some good money.

2099
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:45,300
Right?
It's because of the belt.

2100
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:49,620
Because if you strip him his next fight,
he doesn't have that belt anymore to,

2101
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,940
to,
to get money,

2102
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:53,340
you know?
And so he'll get significantly less

2103
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,620
money.
Say what if you don't have a belt?

2104
01:31:55,621 --> 01:31:58,110
Hell yeah.
Let if what if Max or could be wins,

2105
01:31:58,111 --> 01:31:59,380
right?
One of them I assume is going to win

2106
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:03,940
whoever wanted is,
and then Tony gets healthy and then

2107
01:32:03,941 --> 01:32:06,670
they're going to have tony fight one of
those guys for the title.

2108
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,990
Like he would get less than he would
have for this fight if he doesn't have

2109
01:32:10,991 --> 01:32:12,670
the belt.
Really?

2110
01:32:12,671 --> 01:32:16,780
So that's part of the contract.
If you have a bet with you are going to

2111
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:20,410
negotiate for a fight and you have a
belt,

2112
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:23,140
you have way more power than if you
don't have a belt.

2113
01:32:23,190 --> 01:32:24,730
Right.
So by stripping them of the belt,

2114
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:27,340
his next fight,
when he heals up and comes back,

2115
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:30,000
he's going to,
it's going to cost them.

2116
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:34,420
And it's not fair because again,
Robert Winokur didn't get stripped of

2117
01:32:34,421 --> 01:32:37,060
his interim belt.
They should Max Holloway and Khabib,

2118
01:32:37,061 --> 01:32:37,894
she'd just fight.
Just,

2119
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:39,310
you know,
a main event fight.

2120
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,890
It doesn't have to be for a belt because
that's gonna Fuck Tony.

2121
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:45,550
Well,
why would it fuck Tony if he still gets

2122
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:48,160
the interim title?
If he kept the interim title,

2123
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:51,640
then it wouldn't fuck exactly for his
next fight when he negotiates for his

2124
01:32:51,641 --> 01:32:55,550
next fight hung and he would be interim
title holder versus world title holder.

2125
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:59,200
Why does Max Maxon and could be and have
to fight for a bell?

2126
01:32:59,201 --> 01:33:02,950
It doesn't have to be for a belt.
The UFC holds all the cards.

2127
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:05,410
They can make up the rules,
they can do whatever they want when it

2128
01:33:05,411 --> 01:33:07,000
comes to the rankings and stuff.
Right.

2129
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:09,490
They can't do it or whatever they want
when it comes to rules.

2130
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:12,790
So with their,
their position,

2131
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:13,810
they're like,
look,

2132
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:15,760
this is going to cost us shitload of
money.

2133
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:17,740
How do we recover?
Recoup that money?

2134
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:19,000
You know,
how do we a,

2135
01:33:19,001 --> 01:33:20,470
okay,
we get Holloway to fight.

2136
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:21,640
Oh,
that's almost as big.

2137
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:23,110
That's a giant fight to,
okay,

2138
01:33:23,111 --> 01:33:26,760
now we're back.
Now we're back in business and the

2139
01:33:26,761 --> 01:33:29,830
stripping him thing,
I don't know what the policy is on that.

2140
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:32,080
I don't know if there's a public policy
or if it's just,

2141
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,990
they just make the call.
I think they could do whatever they want

2142
01:33:34,991 --> 01:33:35,824
to do.

2143
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:37,320
Hmm.
I don't,

2144
01:33:37,321 --> 01:33:41,890
I don't think they would never give up
that power if they did have it,

2145
01:33:41,891 --> 01:33:44,650
like to some organizing body.
Like why would they write cause

2146
01:33:44,651 --> 01:33:46,510
organizing bodies could even get
corrupted.

2147
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:51,910
But I think you have to be very careful
when you make like interim titles that

2148
01:33:51,911 --> 01:33:54,760
you don't make too many of them and you
don't have them around too often.

2149
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:55,811
You know,
you're like,

2150
01:33:55,811 --> 01:33:57,700
once you have them,
you've got to get them resolved pretty

2151
01:33:57,701 --> 01:33:58,750
quick.
Like they're,

2152
01:33:58,751 --> 01:34:00,490
they,
they're a way to build up excitement

2153
01:34:00,491 --> 01:34:03,280
about the fight.
But yeah,

2154
01:34:03,281 --> 01:34:05,980
I mean I don't think they would have
stripped him if you got injured four

2155
01:34:05,981 --> 01:34:08,170
weeks ago.
But who knows?

2156
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:10,720
I might be wrong.
They might just be,

2157
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:13,450
maybe they have a new policy.
Maybe they just stripping people,

2158
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:16,810
but then conner hasn't fought in 500
days.

2159
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:18,050
It's not stripped.
Yes,

2160
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:20,200
exactly.
Not stripped yet.

2161
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:24,310
Hasn't fought more than 500 days.
MMA.

2162
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:27,630
Last time he fought it was Eddie Alvarez
does his last time in May fight.

2163
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,020
That was a long time ago,
man,

2164
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:31,990
as a long time ago.
And then,

2165
01:34:31,991 --> 01:34:33,070
uh,
he hasn't been stripped.

2166
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:36,310
So imagine being a lightweight,
just sitting around waiting.

2167
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:38,860
Well,
he's on boxing TV,

2168
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:41,350
having a boxing match and floyd
mayweather,

2169
01:34:41,351 --> 01:34:42,790
he doesn't,
if he gets stripped of his title,

2170
01:34:42,791 --> 01:34:45,370
it doesn't defend,
it makes 100 million bucks.

2171
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:46,420
They're like,
when you fight fighting again,

2172
01:34:46,421 --> 01:34:47,830
and I was like,
who fucking knows?

2173
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:51,910
It would be say shit.
It'd be a lot clear as what to do in

2174
01:34:51,911 --> 01:34:55,060
this situation.
If connor would have just fought like a

2175
01:34:55,061 --> 01:34:57,710
regular lightweight champion,
there wouldn't be this,

2176
01:34:58,090 --> 01:34:59,720
this interim,
uh,

2177
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:01,940
confusion.
It's so good for conor though.

2178
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:03,920
All of it just makes it bigger and
bigger.

2179
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,260
It's like Dave,
Dave and changed the rules for him.

2180
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:07,220
You know?

2181
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:08,810
I mean like,
think about that for him.

2182
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:12,020
Like it just makes him bigger.
He hasn't fun 500 days.

2183
01:35:12,021 --> 01:35:15,470
Who fucking cares?
He's just rolling around a bathtub full

2184
01:35:15,471 --> 01:35:18,740
of hundred dollar bills every day.
Just dive in there and swimming.

2185
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:23,420
He can do whatever the fuck he wants to
see that documentary on Netflix.

2186
01:35:23,421 --> 01:35:24,020
No,
I didn't.

2187
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:25,330
It's really good.
Good.

2188
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,830
Yeah,
he knew he was going to be a champion

2189
01:35:27,831 --> 01:35:30,180
back in the day.
It starts when he,

2190
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:32,190
he has just one tattoo,
the one down,

2191
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,100
one down his back.
That's it.

2192
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:37,550
None of the neck tattoos or anything and
he already knew.

2193
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:40,250
He knew he just had dynamite in his
hands,

2194
01:35:40,251 --> 01:35:42,590
you know,
crushing people on the local local

2195
01:35:42,591 --> 01:35:44,030
scene,
crushing them.

2196
01:35:44,130 --> 01:35:45,710
You know one shots,
boom.

2197
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:49,100
Yeah.
I saw him fight in 2013 I think

2198
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:54,150
somewhere around there and his first
chance at DFC,

2199
01:35:54,230 --> 01:35:55,930
I wouldn't have known if I didn't see
this documentary.

2200
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:59,780
It's hard to keep track of everything
but wasn't Sweden.

2201
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:02,240
It was a Swedish show.
It was like last minute replacement.

2202
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:07,241
They brought him in and he fought.
What was his name?

2203
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,950
Black Guy.
Shit,

2204
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:12,740
I forget his name.
Good guy.

2205
01:36:12,741 --> 01:36:15,980
Real good guy.
And he lit him up and that was like damn

2206
01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:18,500
after that one fight,
like there's,

2207
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:21,350
there's footage of of him and Dana and
like Dana was already,

2208
01:36:21,351 --> 01:36:22,071
he already knew it.
He goes,

2209
01:36:22,071 --> 01:36:24,110
man,
I guess the hype was real.

2210
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:27,830
Jesus.
My favorite fights with him or the two

2211
01:36:27,831 --> 01:36:30,230
fights with Nate Diaz though.
You know why?

2212
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:33,410
Because those are the fights where he
couldn't put someone away,

2213
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:36,380
just crack them and put them away.
So had to see him fight.

2214
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,680
He had a fight and it's a totally
different game.

2215
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:41,600
Like if you see what he did to Eddie
Alvarez,

2216
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:44,450
that was a totally different kind of
fight because he's stung.

2217
01:36:44,450 --> 01:36:48,380
Eddie early had him hurt and he was his,
he owned them and then he fucked him up

2218
01:36:48,381 --> 01:36:50,420
and stopped him.
That was a beating.

2219
01:36:50,450 --> 01:36:52,760
What round was that?
I think it was a second single was a

2220
01:36:52,761 --> 01:36:55,220
second and he barely made it out of the
first,

2221
01:36:55,221 --> 01:36:55,940
right.
Yeah,

2222
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:58,640
barely made it.
I mean he got fucked up from the get go.

2223
01:36:59,030 --> 01:37:02,840
Connor just had us number is way faster
weight quicker and like covering

2224
01:37:02,841 --> 01:37:06,080
distance,
just just like laser beams at night.

2225
01:37:06,081 --> 01:37:08,510
And I don't think Eddie fought right.
I think Eddie was a little bit too

2226
01:37:08,511 --> 01:37:11,330
caught up in the moment is the big hype
of the fight getting to fight conor

2227
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:15,050
mcgregor and he just got fucked up,
kind of had his hands behind his back

2228
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,120
and standing right in front of him.
Chicken neck and I'm,

2229
01:37:17,121 --> 01:37:21,080
and then pop them in the face like that
was ugly so that you know,

2230
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:22,500
like what year was that?

2231
01:37:24,230 --> 01:37:29,230
That was 500 of those 500 days ago.
Like that's the kind of fight is a great

2232
01:37:30,321 --> 01:37:33,230
fight for conor,
but that's all hammer.

2233
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:36,920
When he fought nate,
he had to be the nail through a lot of

2234
01:37:36,921 --> 01:37:37,700
that.
Yep.

2235
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:40,610
The whole fucking second round of the
first fight.

2236
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:42,950
When nate got them down,
it was the second round submission,

2237
01:37:42,951 --> 01:37:43,784
right,
wasn't it?

2238
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:47,660
I Dunno when he submitted him,
but nate's submit them in the second

2239
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:48,471
round.
What are you looking at?

2240
01:37:48,471 --> 01:37:52,310
Me Funny when you've got something these
full pull up more than I do with my

2241
01:37:52,311 --> 01:37:54,050
Dick.
That's what connor said.

2242
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:58,530
These pull out more than I do with my
deck and like how we got to specify with

2243
01:37:58,531 --> 01:38:00,840
his dead.
He must have the only pulled out four

2244
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:03,680
times Max.
That's not that great.

2245
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:06,360
The fights with nate were fights,
you know,

2246
01:38:06,361 --> 01:38:08,730
he had to dig deep and he lost the first
one.

2247
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:11,780
He got beat up and got taken down.
He got his back taken.

2248
01:38:11,781 --> 01:38:13,110
He got choked.
He tapped.

2249
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:17,910
I mean he fucking lost that fight.
And then the second fight he drops nate.

2250
01:38:17,911 --> 01:38:20,700
But he can't put nate away.
Nate gets back up,

2251
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,950
they're going after it.
There's fucking times where he's got to

2252
01:38:22,951 --> 01:38:25,590
stand and walk away.
He's got walkway cause he's too tired.

2253
01:38:25,591 --> 01:38:27,020
He can't engage right now.
Please.

2254
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:29,340
So you've walked away a couple of times
in those exchanges.

2255
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:31,470
Those were dig,
dig fights.

2256
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:33,720
What's this buddy?
Round two.

2257
01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:34,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

2258
01:38:34,891 --> 01:38:37,260
Okay.
We're submission real Nigga choke four

2259
01:38:37,261 --> 01:38:38,760
minutes and 12 seconds it around too.
Yeah.

2260
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:41,250
He beat him down,
warm down and then stopped him.

2261
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:46,290
That's and the fight that conard one.
Could that have gone either?

2262
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:47,190
Yes.
Yes.

2263
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:50,430
It was arguments that's very close fight
and a really close fight.

2264
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:54,590
I think under the new rules connor
probably would have won because um,

2265
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,280
I think,
look,

2266
01:38:56,490 --> 01:38:59,610
I think even just one knocked down,
it's not good enough for a 10,

2267
01:38:59,611 --> 01:39:00,180
eight round.

2268
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:01,410
It's just not,
you know,

2269
01:39:01,411 --> 01:39:02,760
in a,
in a five minute round,

2270
01:39:02,761 --> 01:39:04,440
like one knocked down,
it's,

2271
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,330
it's,
it depends on how the other exchanges

2272
01:39:06,331 --> 01:39:08,190
were going.
These changes were all the same and then

2273
01:39:08,191 --> 01:39:10,260
you cracked him once.
He definitely won.

2274
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:13,950
But did you win ten eight ten eight is a
beat down I think,

2275
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:15,780
you know,
but even I think that should be wrong.

2276
01:39:15,781 --> 01:39:18,780
I don't think it should be that.
I think she'd be like a hundred points

2277
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:23,250
and I think they should have like scores
for like one through 10 in striking,

2278
01:39:23,251 --> 01:39:27,060
one through 10 in wrestling,
one through 10 or nonapplicable.

2279
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:28,980
If there's no wrestling at all,
you just attend.

2280
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,390
But you got to look at it this way
though.

2281
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:31,170
If,
um,

2282
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:36,170
if you could have a fight and in one
round it's super close and really

2283
01:39:36,691 --> 01:39:40,410
nothing happened and just super close
and no one really connected anything.

2284
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:43,320
And that happens all the time.
That's a ten nine round.

2285
01:39:43,321 --> 01:39:44,154
Right,
right.

2286
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:45,820
Should,
uh,

2287
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:50,490
and then you compare that to another
round where a guy got dropped but it was

2288
01:39:50,491 --> 01:39:53,190
kind of a flash knockdown.
He pops back up and then they,

2289
01:39:53,191 --> 01:39:54,960
then it's kind of,
even for the rest of the round,

2290
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:56,790
that can't be a ten nine too.
Right?

2291
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,260
So either you got to make more,
10 10 rounds or nine nine rounds,

2292
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:03,000
and then you could say,
okay,

2293
01:40:03,001 --> 01:40:06,720
knock down doesn't necessarily mean ten
eight cause then at ten nine is going to

2294
01:40:06,721 --> 01:40:09,960
mean one dude.
Clearly one any lamb and some good

2295
01:40:09,961 --> 01:40:13,350
shots.
That's a ten nine it's all how you lay

2296
01:40:13,351 --> 01:40:14,430
it down.
So if you're going to give,

2297
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:18,120
you know dude who where the round could
have gone either way and you're going to

2298
01:40:18,121 --> 01:40:22,320
get someone at ten nine and it looks
just like a dude getting knocked down.

2299
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:23,820
It should,
that should be different.

2300
01:40:23,821 --> 01:40:28,821
So it all depends how add more draws or
make it so that if you knock a dude

2301
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:32,010
down,
that's an automatic ten eight round,

2302
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:34,080
you're not going to Dennis ten eight you
knocked him down.

2303
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,890
[inaudible] your ass.
What if he's beating your ass all over

2304
01:40:37,891 --> 01:40:40,890
the place and then you catch them with
like five seconds to go drop him and he

2305
01:40:40,891 --> 01:40:43,230
gets right back up and he cracks you
with a jab.

2306
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:45,270
Do you still get a tenant because you
dropped him?

2307
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:49,050
I think that's a,
I think I would say that's a nine.

2308
01:40:49,051 --> 01:40:51,070
Nine.
Yeah,

2309
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:52,530
it's a nine,
nine maybe.

2310
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,810
Right?
Cause it depends on how much she's

2311
01:40:54,850 --> 01:40:58,600
beating your ass before the guys beating
your ass down the whole round.

2312
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:03,580
And then you clip him once and he drops.
Maybe you weren't really beating him

2313
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:05,800
down that hard.
Maybe it just look like it cause he's

2314
01:41:05,801 --> 01:41:06,730
still cracked.

2315
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:08,500
He,
if you were really beating him down,

2316
01:41:08,590 --> 01:41:12,190
how was he able to to knock you down?
It happens all the time.

2317
01:41:12,191 --> 01:41:14,200
Guys still have power.
Especially if you're running into

2318
01:41:14,201 --> 01:41:17,230
something that's a hard one.
That's a hard one to school and knocked

2319
01:41:17,231 --> 01:41:19,840
down than a beat down.
You get out class,

2320
01:41:19,841 --> 01:41:22,870
the whole match or the whole round and
then you get knocked down once.

2321
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:27,490
Do you remember when the draw Drago Pete
cell fought?

2322
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:28,690
Uh,
Scott Smith.

2323
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:31,180
Scott Smith from rocky four.
No,

2324
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,770
I'm kidding.
That's not that.

2325
01:41:32,771 --> 01:41:35,350
That's your center.
Do you remember who drago in the second

2326
01:41:35,351 --> 01:41:36,590
round against rocky.
We met him.

2327
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:39,670
Remember I talked to Matt Serra's?
I remember Pete Sell Pizza.

2328
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:40,960
Yes.
I know exactly what you're,

2329
01:41:41,290 --> 01:41:42,440
Pete dropped,
uh,

2330
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:43,880
hurt.
Um,

2331
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:46,840
Scott Smith real bad with a left hook to
the body.

2332
01:41:46,841 --> 01:41:50,940
Like Scott doubled over and winced and
pete moved in for the kill and Scott

2333
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:53,770
just landed the perfect picture point.

2334
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:55,570
But he,
but he was at like,

2335
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:57,430
wasn't,
was hurricane it faking it?

2336
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,980
No,
he dropped an agony after he knocked him

2337
01:41:59,981 --> 01:42:00,790
out.
Yeah.

2338
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:03,940
Pete Hook to hook them to the body hurt
him real bad.

2339
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:07,180
And when Pete moved in for the kill,
Scott Smith hit him with a per picture.

2340
01:42:07,181 --> 01:42:08,170
Perfect.
But I do remember,

2341
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:11,590
I remember that just knocked him out.
He falls back and then Scott Smith's

2342
01:42:11,591 --> 01:42:13,270
drops to the ground.
If they stopped the fight and he's in

2343
01:42:13,271 --> 01:42:15,760
agony holding onto his side.
It was crazy.

2344
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:18,010
It was crazy.
So that can't happen.

2345
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:22,120
Like even if you're beating a guy down
there is still moving if they still just

2346
01:42:22,121 --> 01:42:25,750
plant and just uncork one Pat Barry
Check Congo.

2347
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:29,350
Remember that shit?
Pat Barry had check Congo on co we're

2348
01:42:29,351 --> 01:42:32,830
street,
he was wobbling all over the place.

2349
01:42:32,831 --> 01:42:37,540
It looked like the fight was over and
pat moves in for the kill and boom,

2350
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:42,340
check Congo hits him with the hay maker
as he's running in flatlines Pat Barry

2351
01:42:42,341 --> 01:42:46,120
for the first time in his career,
chicken happen.

2352
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:48,820
If you're not knocked out,
you're still moving.

2353
01:42:48,850 --> 01:42:50,830
You still could knock someone out.
It can happen,

2354
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:52,810
especially if they get careless.
There it is.

2355
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:54,880
He hits him with the left lead,
this boom.

2356
01:42:54,881 --> 01:42:57,610
I mean as a picture perfect left hook to
the body,

2357
01:42:57,611 --> 01:42:59,500
but watch this.
He's in agony.

2358
01:42:59,530 --> 01:43:04,530
If Pete moves in back home,
I mean that is a crazy right hand.

2359
01:43:04,990 --> 01:43:08,740
That's like round nine of a lange versus
Balboa.

2360
01:43:09,170 --> 01:43:11,200
I looked at him on the ground and agony
afterwards.

2361
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:15,880
Pizza couldn't even believe it happened.
Yeah,

2362
01:43:15,881 --> 01:43:18,700
you should always faint before you move
in.

2363
01:43:18,780 --> 01:43:20,170
Always.
Always.

2364
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:22,390
Even if you think you got a guy hurt
checks.

2365
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:24,430
Yes.
Fees like this.

2366
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:25,393
Oh,
okay.

2367
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:26,950
Okay.
Give me something.

2368
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:29,890
Show me what you got going on.
I mean the best guys,

2369
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:31,840
they never just charged like Max
Holloway.

2370
01:43:31,841 --> 01:43:33,350
We fished off.
Aldo is.

2371
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,050
It's constant pressure,
constant pressure,

2372
01:43:35,051 --> 01:43:38,500
but when he feels Aldo firing bags,
I'll step back for a second.

2373
01:43:38,650 --> 01:43:40,470
Right back on your baby.
The best painter,

2374
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:42,970
that's always pretty good.
Damn good at it.

2375
01:43:43,290 --> 01:43:46,600
It seems like I just saw someone fight
in the UFC or maybe Bella tour.

2376
01:43:46,601 --> 01:43:49,860
That was always just fainting.
Just one boy.

2377
01:43:50,210 --> 01:43:52,100
Wonderboy might get my,
my vote

2378
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:55,790
for the best fainter because wonderboy
also has like,

2379
01:43:55,791 --> 01:43:57,170
it's like what?
What style?

2380
01:43:57,171 --> 01:44:01,700
Faintings most effective wonderboy has
an extra advantage of having that right

2381
01:44:01,701 --> 01:44:04,100
leg forward or left leg forward,
whichever he chooses.

2382
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:07,370
Sideway stance with that long body of
his,

2383
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:11,810
that's a weird thing I've dealt with
that man and the old martial arts days

2384
01:44:11,811 --> 01:44:14,030
and taekwondo days.
It's the hardest thing to deal with

2385
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:17,600
those long guys that can have a,
that have a powerful front leg.

2386
01:44:17,870 --> 01:44:20,000
He just keeps you away.
You don't know what the fuck he's doing,

2387
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:23,000
so he faints and then Bam,
he comes in with a left hand or he

2388
01:44:23,001 --> 01:44:25,040
faints and boom is a roundhouse kick in
your face.

2389
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,470
I think he's the most,
cause he doesn't also,

2390
01:44:27,471 --> 01:44:30,860
it doesn't move like everybody else.
Everybody else has like sort of a

2391
01:44:30,861 --> 01:44:35,780
modified taekwondo style or a Moy Thai
style rather,

2392
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:37,700
except for the taekwondo guys.

2393
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:41,150
There's a few guys,
like even connor connor has more of a

2394
01:44:41,151 --> 01:44:43,550
karate style.
A lot of the times he'll stand like

2395
01:44:43,551 --> 01:44:45,140
total.
Like when you see him fight Aldo,

2396
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:47,900
he stood totally sideways.
I mean he was,

2397
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:51,170
he was bouncing back and forth,
back and forth like a karate fighter.

2398
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:53,000
Remember how Don the Dragon Wilson is
to,

2399
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:56,390
is to just get up on one leg and just
keep his left leg kind of flip it.

2400
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:58,190
Oh,
it just be on one leg and just keep the

2401
01:44:58,191 --> 01:44:59,570
left leg all the way up.
Dude.

2402
01:44:59,571 --> 01:45:02,090
I sparred with that guy once.
He's annoying.

2403
01:45:02,091 --> 01:45:02,690
Right?
Uh,

2404
01:45:02,690 --> 01:45:05,060
he's very good at that.
He's very good at that.

2405
01:45:05,061 --> 01:45:07,640
He was real nice to try to earn too much
energy.

2406
01:45:07,790 --> 01:45:10,520
Well,
he was just not good high kick him.

2407
01:45:10,521 --> 01:45:12,350
You could tie kick him dude.
He's good at that too.

2408
01:45:12,351 --> 01:45:15,170
If you watch don Wilson's fight with
Dennis Lexio,

2409
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:17,930
Don Wilson fucked Dennis Alexio up back
when?

2410
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:19,640
Dennis Lexia,
I didn't know about leg kicks.

2411
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:24,080
Dennis Alexia want wound up becoming one
of the very best guys that leg kicks.

2412
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:28,040
He was also one of the first guys I ever
saw get his leg broken in a fight.

2413
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:32,060
He fought stan the man longe Anitas and
he had to a grass skirt Australia

2414
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:39,080
and Stan Lodge Nitas he used to work
with my friend Shuki remember Shuki the,

2415
01:45:39,081 --> 01:45:39,880
the,
the uh,

2416
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:44,300
the Israeli guy who was teaching me
kickboxing back in your day,

2417
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:49,190
his leg was all fucked up because he
would hold pads for Stan longe Anitas he

2418
01:45:49,191 --> 01:45:54,191
had that big old type leg pad at home.
Like if you think some people,

2419
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:56,810
like if you see a guy who kicks real
hard,

2420
01:45:56,811 --> 01:46:00,950
right?
The heavyweight world champion Moitai

2421
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:04,250
guys or Thai boxer,
a kickboxer guys like a standalone.

2422
01:46:04,251 --> 01:46:07,850
Janine is the power they have in their
Kik is unfathomable.

2423
01:46:08,050 --> 01:46:10,760
I remember I brought this up with you,
but you say it wasn't you.

2424
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:14,000
I was at Beverly Hills Jujitsu once and
we were watching Pedro his,

2425
01:46:14,001 --> 01:46:14,840
oh,
kick the bag.

2426
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,970
And I was like,
what?

2427
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:20,030
Like you just think of one of those
slamming into your thigh and you're

2428
01:46:20,031 --> 01:46:20,900
like,
there's no way.

2429
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,280
There's no way.
He shook,

2430
01:46:22,281 --> 01:46:25,130
his whole leg was fucked up and holding
the pat on one side.

2431
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:28,250
He was gonna need a hip replacement.
Damn Dude.

2432
01:46:28,490 --> 01:46:30,650
Magic.
I kicked your leg while you're holding

2433
01:46:30,651 --> 01:46:33,200
pads for him so hard.
You need a hip replacement.

2434
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:39,080
What was not worth it on the Dragon?
Wilson beat the beat.

2435
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:41,000
Um,
Dennis Alexia with leg kicks with my

2436
01:46:41,001 --> 01:46:43,580
point.
But Don had that weird style.

2437
01:46:43,581 --> 01:46:47,090
Like he would stand totally sideways and
he didn't take any chances.

2438
01:46:47,091 --> 01:46:50,220
He fought superintelligent.
He fought deep into his forties to man.

2439
01:46:50,490 --> 01:46:51,940
He's an Oj.
Yeah.

2440
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:52,883
Yeah.

2441
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:57,840
Commentary with him.
He was my partner in King of the cage

2442
01:46:57,841 --> 01:47:00,420
for maybe five or six shows.
Man.

2443
01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:05,040
Talk about the worst co commentary ever.
Me and Donna driving was really bad.

2444
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:09,620
Oh yeah.
Can you imagine a na commentary is?

2445
01:47:09,621 --> 01:47:10,740
It's not,
that's not my Gig,

2446
01:47:10,741 --> 01:47:11,910
man.
I could do color,

2447
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:15,090
but being the play by play guy,
that's just a whole,

2448
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:18,360
that's a whole different animal with,
with Phil Baroni.

2449
01:47:18,590 --> 01:47:21,810
Ronnie was fucking hilarious.
It was the Miami show.

2450
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:24,330
Yup.
We got to get tiny UFC in Miami.

2451
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:26,220
I think that was the only one ever.
Right.

2452
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:29,820
Um,
I don't know about that.

2453
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:30,900
This is gone.
The Dragon.

2454
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:32,670
Don Wilson.
Who was he fighting here?

2455
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:34,500
There he is.
Look at him in these red pants.

2456
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:36,630
Oh,
it's him fighting Dennis Lexio.

2457
01:47:36,631 --> 01:47:38,790
Yeah.
See how he would just flip that thing

2458
01:47:38,791 --> 01:47:41,790
out?
Everything was like light and flippy and

2459
01:47:41,791 --> 01:47:42,650
they just,
they couldn't,

2460
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:43,620
he didn't know what to do with it.

2461
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:45,930
They couldn't kick to the legs,
right?

2462
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:46,710
Oh,
they could.

2463
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:47,640
Or they could wait.
Oh,

2464
01:47:47,641 --> 01:47:48,600
look at that site.
You know,

2465
01:47:48,601 --> 01:47:51,390
they could see you just kicked him in
the leg right there.

2466
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:54,420
Don Wilson fucked him up with low kicks
in this fight.

2467
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:56,490
See?
Desolo Alexia was trying to kick them in

2468
01:47:56,491 --> 01:47:59,490
the legs.
This is after what had happened was a

2469
01:47:59,491 --> 01:48:04,460
lot of these guys like Don Wilson that
had a traditional karate background,

2470
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:09,060
learn how to kickbox.
They realized how potent leg kicks were.

2471
01:48:09,061 --> 01:48:13,530
A big factor was rick the Jet Rufus Du
group as his brother,

2472
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:17,850
who was one of the all time best pka
style above the waist.

2473
01:48:17,851 --> 01:48:20,250
Kickboxers Rick Rufus.
When I was a kid,

2474
01:48:20,251 --> 01:48:21,900
man,
I want it to be like Rick Rufus.

2475
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:25,830
He would fight dude sideways stance and
just fucked him up,

2476
01:48:25,831 --> 01:48:29,880
fucked him up with a hook kicks and
roundhouse kicks and dive in with

2477
01:48:29,881 --> 01:48:32,070
punches like blitz karate style punches.

2478
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:36,420
I mean Rick Rufus was doing shit that
nobody was doing and he fought his tie.

2479
01:48:36,421 --> 01:48:38,520
Dude,
I do not remember the gentleman's name,

2480
01:48:38,521 --> 01:48:41,490
but Duke roufus brought it up.
I'll podcast is being like a big

2481
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:45,360
transformation in his life cause that
top side you fight is just chopped.

2482
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:48,450
Rick down.
Just chose those legs like a mix rules,

2483
01:48:48,451 --> 01:48:51,050
a little bit of Muay Thai,
a little bit of American kickbox and

2484
01:48:51,051 --> 01:48:54,150
they allowed the leg kicks but they
didn't allow elbows or something like

2485
01:48:54,151 --> 01:48:57,480
that exact set up and and a k one.
Yes.

2486
01:48:57,630 --> 01:48:59,940
Here it is.
What does it the guy's name?

2487
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:02,280
Yeah,
the fight that hug out was pause that

2488
01:49:02,281 --> 01:49:07,281
real quick.
Chang's Plec Keyapp Song Grit Kyat some

2489
01:49:07,870 --> 01:49:12,020
[inaudible] Chang quick Chinese quick
Yuck Song Grit.

2490
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:13,770
Which okay.
Record.

2491
01:49:14,490 --> 01:49:16,290
Oh well yeah,
he had like more than a hundred

2492
01:49:16,291 --> 01:49:18,240
professional fights.
I mean he was a world champion.

2493
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:19,650
He wasn't an okay guy.
Yeah,

2494
01:49:19,651 --> 01:49:20,220
he was really good.

2495
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:21,660
Okay.
I thought he was a beast.

2496
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:22,801
He,
okay.

2497
01:49:22,801 --> 01:49:25,830
Let's see what his,
what he was fucking him up with his

2498
01:49:25,831 --> 01:49:27,840
hands though.
Rick roof was fucking him up with his

2499
01:49:27,841 --> 01:49:28,740
hands.
Had Him hurt,

2500
01:49:28,741 --> 01:49:30,240
had him almost knocked out a couple of
times,

2501
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:33,900
but he kept landing those leg kicks and
the leg kicks back.

2502
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:37,650
Had to be carried off in a stretcher.
He couldn't fight because he couldn't

2503
01:49:37,651 --> 01:49:40,680
walk down his legs gave out,
gone.

2504
01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:42,210
Well,
he didn't know what it was there.

2505
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:45,420
So I mean it'd be,
this is like a long time ago.

2506
01:49:45,421 --> 01:49:47,860
He didn't understand,
but he tagged with some punches,

2507
01:49:47,861 --> 01:49:48,370
man.

2508
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:50,590
He could hurt.
He could hang with his hands.

2509
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:52,510
No,
we'll get that spinning back fist and

2510
01:49:52,511 --> 01:49:54,520
the punch behind it,
he was fucking him up.

2511
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:57,850
He really was fumbling by little,
he was landing them like his little Thai

2512
01:49:57,851 --> 01:50:02,020
guy is though to take those shots.
One of the greatest back fights ever.

2513
01:50:02,021 --> 01:50:03,370
And kickboxing history.
Just,

2514
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:07,870
just the fact that this is how Rick
Rufus learned the power of who that

2515
01:50:07,871 --> 01:50:10,280
fucking go back there real quick.
Go back there guys.

2516
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:13,030
Almost go back.
Watch this.

2517
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:15,540
Look at this move that he does.
He does that.

2518
01:50:15,541 --> 01:50:19,600
A touch jumping side posts,
spinning wheel kick hit him in the head.

2519
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:21,820
Dudes out on his feet at the end of the
bell,

2520
01:50:21,821 --> 01:50:23,680
they sit them down in the corner,
out on his feet.

2521
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:27,150
Just keep playing.
This one of the greatest matches that's

2522
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:30,250
of all time.
So historically significant in martial

2523
01:50:30,251 --> 01:50:32,590
arts.
This is why this is where they learned.

2524
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:34,300
Yes.
This is one of those American

2525
01:50:34,301 --> 01:50:35,620
kickboxers.
This is,

2526
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:39,040
this is was an eye opener.
This is like UFC one for kickboxing.

2527
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:40,150
Dude.
I remember the first,

2528
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:43,780
the first time someone ever kicked me in
the leg and they didn't even do it hard.

2529
01:50:44,110 --> 01:50:46,960
They did it to show me like how hard it
is when you get kicked in the leg.

2530
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:49,780
It was like a light bulb went off.
Oh No.

2531
01:50:49,870 --> 01:50:51,430
The first time I've ever heard of a leg
kick.

2532
01:50:51,431 --> 01:50:52,120
I was,
uh,

2533
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:56,620
working at the Strip club as a DJ and
one of the managers was all into karate.

2534
01:50:56,621 --> 01:50:59,440
He turned them into,
you always had done tournament karate

2535
01:50:59,441 --> 01:51:00,580
for 12.
Oh Shit.

2536
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:03,100
Look at this dude.
He's lightened him up with his leg

2537
01:51:03,101 --> 01:51:03,821
kicks.
And then,

2538
01:51:03,821 --> 01:51:06,490
uh,
he took me in the back one day and he

2539
01:51:06,491 --> 01:51:07,324
goes,
dude,

2540
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:08,680
stand there.
Let me kick you.

2541
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:09,820
And he kicked me with his shin.
He goes,

2542
01:51:09,821 --> 01:51:12,010
people are doing this now.
How does that feel?

2543
01:51:12,011 --> 01:51:14,290
Does he wasn't,
she was experimenting on mine legs.

2544
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:16,900
Does this hurt their lending with their
shin?

2545
01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:18,010
And I'm like,
damn it.

2546
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:20,530
Fuck that a lot.
Their Shins.

2547
01:51:20,531 --> 01:51:21,400
That's weird.
Well,

2548
01:51:21,401 --> 01:51:25,270
the crazy thing is when you feel it for
like from someone who's just like

2549
01:51:25,271 --> 01:51:26,890
tapping your leg,
how much it hurts.

2550
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:30,310
Now think of this dude whose name I
can't pronounce again.

2551
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,970
Oh look.
So rick would try to throw his own kick,

2552
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:36,940
but his low kicks were like foot kicks.
The,

2553
01:51:36,950 --> 01:51:38,080
I mean,
he was a foot kicker.

2554
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:42,370
He wasn't like a Shin Kicker back then.
Like most karate guys,

2555
01:51:42,371 --> 01:51:45,070
we're in step kickers.
You would hit a guy with a roundhouse

2556
01:51:45,071 --> 01:51:46,570
kick,
but you had hit him in the body with

2557
01:51:46,571 --> 01:51:48,100
your instep.
You hit him in the head with your

2558
01:51:48,110 --> 01:51:48,790
instep.

2559
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:53,790
Almost everything I ever did up until I
started doing Moitai was with my insteps

2560
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:58,000
or the heel like heel kicks.
We'll kicks.

2561
01:51:58,690 --> 01:52:03,690
Stuff like that was incredible that
Americans didn't figure that out.

2562
01:52:04,451 --> 01:52:07,000
You know?
Isn't that killed him in the leg yet?

2563
01:52:07,001 --> 01:52:09,130
I mean this is crazy shit.
Did he hit him with a punch on the way

2564
01:52:09,131 --> 01:52:11,260
down?
Back that up again real quick.

2565
01:52:12,270 --> 01:52:13,540
Just out.
Just a hair.

2566
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:14,980
Look at this.
He goes down.

2567
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:18,100
Yeah.
He elbowed him in the back of the head.

2568
01:52:18,430 --> 01:52:20,560
Holy Shit Dude.
Show that again.

2569
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:24,370
Watch this again.
Watch what happens.

2570
01:52:24,371 --> 01:52:26,290
He goes down and on the way down,
watch this.

2571
01:52:26,291 --> 01:52:27,310
Boom.
See that elbow,

2572
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:29,170
Yo dude,
no doubt.

2573
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:32,260
Dirty elbow to the back of the dome.
One more time please.

2574
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:33,370
One more time.
Please.

2575
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:36,580
Look at this down on its way down.
Watch his left.

2576
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:39,640
Boom.
He fucking cracked the back of his head

2577
01:52:39,641 --> 01:52:42,220
with the help of referee.
Didn't even know what an elbow was.

2578
01:52:42,430 --> 01:52:44,770
That's an invalid technique.
You're tenured,

2579
01:52:44,771 --> 01:52:46,210
you miss a punch.
Landed

2580
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,230
with his elbow,
tried and land a punch.

2581
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:49,083
Buddy.
Dot.

2582
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:51,080
Going to take any points away because
you didn't land,

2583
01:52:53,450 --> 01:52:56,660
Dude.
He's fucking that right leg up south

2584
01:52:56,670 --> 01:52:58,330
potter southpaw.
Oh,

2585
01:52:58,440 --> 01:52:59,990
look at that and made him switch.
Dance is,

2586
01:52:59,991 --> 01:53:02,150
look at that.
He's chopping them down.

2587
01:53:02,151 --> 01:53:04,460
Dude.
You can't even imagine how bad this must

2588
01:53:04,461 --> 01:53:06,590
hurt for Rick Rufus and the middle of
this fight.

2589
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:08,210
He doesn't know how to block these
things.

2590
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:11,090
He's taken one on the front leg,
one on the back leg.

2591
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:13,700
He's just getting crushed.
I mean,

2592
01:53:13,701 --> 01:53:16,130
this is crazy.
You want to cross the front with a Dick?

2593
01:53:16,131 --> 01:53:19,480
Is duties flatfooted now he can't to
bullying.

2594
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:21,860
Can't spin.
He can't spend.

2595
01:53:21,861 --> 01:53:23,750
Look at this.
Accompanied by a stomp.

2596
01:53:24,050 --> 01:53:26,180
He stopped him.
Oh,

2597
01:53:26,181 --> 01:53:29,240
that's top to the body was legit.
Oh my God.

2598
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:33,470
Damn.
They need to make a movie out of this.

2599
01:53:33,471 --> 01:53:34,304
This is crazy.

2600
01:53:34,490 --> 01:53:37,560
They should make a move.
They should make a documentary from the

2601
01:53:38,070 --> 01:53:40,460
boy.
A pour a tie fighter.

2602
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,300
Right,
and rufus like make rick roof is the

2603
01:53:44,301 --> 01:53:46,040
evil white guy.
He can't.

2604
01:53:46,041 --> 01:53:48,350
He wants to blow up the world.
He can't even move.

2605
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:50,990
This is like,
these guys are so important.

2606
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:54,830
It's so important to our understanding
because Rick Rufus was so good.

2607
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:57,680
He was so good and he was doing movies,
shit on people.

2608
01:53:57,890 --> 01:53:59,360
Those jump,
roundhouse kick,

2609
01:53:59,450 --> 01:54:02,420
Spinning Hook kicks.
Look at this round too.

2610
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:07,730
I mean he was doing some really wild
shit and even landing it on this guy

2611
01:54:07,731 --> 01:54:11,000
like he was fucking good.
He was a legit champion,

2612
01:54:11,030 --> 01:54:14,900
no doubt about it,
but he just did not understand the low

2613
01:54:14,901 --> 01:54:18,470
kick game yet and this was,
it was so important for a guy.

2614
01:54:18,471 --> 01:54:19,880
Look at that.
He lands that high kick.

2615
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:22,220
It's,
it was so important that a guy,

2616
01:54:22,221 --> 01:54:26,750
as good as him fought this guy so we
know for sure it wasn't just that,

2617
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:28,820
you know the ric rufus wasn't any good.

2618
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:32,690
No rich rufus was fogging or real good.
Real good.

2619
01:54:32,691 --> 01:54:35,240
Then too.
He's getting crushed with those

2620
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:40,760
and this tie guys look at as open hands
to look how he's moving forward.

2621
01:54:41,330 --> 01:54:44,390
Just open hands.
He's all about protecting himself,

2622
01:54:44,391 --> 01:54:46,640
pushing off and low kicking.
Look at his hands.

2623
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:48,770
See His hand placement.
I mean,

2624
01:54:48,771 --> 01:54:50,390
that's crazy shit.
Look at that.

2625
01:54:50,391 --> 01:54:51,500
Boom,
pushing off.

2626
01:54:51,590 --> 01:54:53,360
He's barely even tried to punch with
them.

2627
01:54:53,450 --> 01:54:57,530
He's basically just using his hands to
create space and distance and give Rick

2628
01:54:57,530 --> 01:55:00,230
Rick roof is something to think about
and to block the punches in the kick

2629
01:55:00,231 --> 01:55:02,690
that rufus throws and then boom leg
kicks.

2630
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:04,970
He just leg kicks him to death.
Look at that.

2631
01:55:05,150 --> 01:55:07,340
He's not punching.
He's just leg kick.

2632
01:55:07,341 --> 01:55:08,360
Leg kick.
Hands up,

2633
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:13,220
hands up like that is crazy.
As soon as he stopped exchanging

2634
01:55:13,221 --> 01:55:15,680
punches,
he just started dominating the space and

2635
01:55:15,681 --> 01:55:17,720
then slamming those leg kicks in.
Look at that.

2636
01:55:17,721 --> 01:55:20,330
Boom.
Fakes with the hand and across both

2637
01:55:20,331 --> 01:55:22,160
thighs.
That's one of the most painful ones,

2638
01:55:22,161 --> 01:55:23,990
man.
The ones across both thighs.

2639
01:55:24,090 --> 01:55:25,360
Ah,
ah.

2640
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:29,510
Rob came in back when I was getting
coaching from him.

2641
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:32,690
He tapped me across the front of my
thoughts with his shin.

2642
01:55:32,691 --> 01:55:34,640
Just dunk.
Just tapped me.

2643
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:38,780
My legs hurt all day.
This guy.

2644
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:41,510
Wow.
Really that throw holy Shit.

2645
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:43,980
Those ties.
Can Chuck each other around.

2646
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:47,490
Two man
round posted a little clip.

2647
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:49,080
Oh Shit.
Look at that.

2648
01:55:49,140 --> 01:55:52,050
Of a fight where they had,
didn't they just wrapped up their hands?

2649
01:55:52,051 --> 01:55:54,170
They didn't have gloves and the head
butts were legal.

2650
01:55:54,171 --> 01:55:57,570
It was kickboxing or you could throw
pieces and you could have,

2651
01:55:57,571 --> 01:56:00,510
but did you see that clip?
No Dude,

2652
01:56:00,511 --> 01:56:04,140
it's evil guy headbutts his opponent
standing up.

2653
01:56:04,141 --> 01:56:07,110
He just,
just spears his head right into a knocks

2654
01:56:07,111 --> 01:56:09,390
the guy down just from a headbutt and
rufus.

2655
01:56:09,391 --> 01:56:12,420
Like he only stands that one way most of
the time too.

2656
01:56:12,570 --> 01:56:16,770
So that that front right leg is so
vulnerable to that left outside kick

2657
01:56:16,771 --> 01:56:20,310
cause they're both southpaw.
If rucc rick see now he's trying to

2658
01:56:20,311 --> 01:56:23,460
switch up and he's putting his left leg
forward cause he's in so much pain.

2659
01:56:23,461 --> 01:56:25,470
Like look,
when he walks back to his corner do he

2660
01:56:25,471 --> 01:56:27,240
could barely walk at the end of the
third round.

2661
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:29,910
Barely.
Was this in Thailand or was in the

2662
01:56:29,911 --> 01:56:31,500
states?
I don't know where it was.

2663
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:33,520
It looks,
it says cores,

2664
01:56:33,530 --> 01:56:36,750
beer on the canvas.
I want to think it's in America and plus

2665
01:56:36,751 --> 01:56:39,270
the way they're making them where he's
wearing those pants.

2666
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:43,230
I got to think it's America.
Those pants look so stupid in

2667
01:56:43,231 --> 01:56:45,630
comparison.
And also Rick Rufus was also wearing

2668
01:56:45,631 --> 01:56:47,070
pads on his feet.
Oh Shit.

2669
01:56:47,071 --> 01:56:49,270
How did he go down their leg?
Kick another leg.

2670
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:52,080
Can you rewind that Jamie?
Look at the pads.

2671
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:53,730
Look at the pads on his feet.
Okay,

2672
01:56:53,731 --> 01:56:54,421
here,
look at this.

2673
01:56:54,421 --> 01:56:57,180
How does he go down?
Oh that was just the leg kick.

2674
01:56:57,181 --> 01:57:00,300
Yeah,
just low kick caught him in the spin and

2675
01:57:00,301 --> 01:57:02,490
just totally took his leg out and he's
wearing those,

2676
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:06,720
those booties on the tops of his feet to
like to protect the bones of his feet

2677
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:07,950
cause he's a foot kicker.

2678
01:57:08,210 --> 01:57:09,720
See what I'm saying?
Like that's extra weight.

2679
01:57:10,110 --> 01:57:12,900
You were an extra four ounces or
whatever the fuck it is on your feet.

2680
01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:17,130
It slows your kicks down and the Thai
guy just says taped up ankles and shorts

2681
01:57:17,131 --> 01:57:18,510
on.
It's really interesting because it's

2682
01:57:18,511 --> 01:57:23,070
really is like kickboxing versus Moitai
pool and we chopped the leg gambling,

2683
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:23,933
we chops late.
Again,

2684
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:27,000
look at this work roof is in so much
danger here.

2685
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:29,910
I mean he's basically just totally
helpless.

2686
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:32,130
And this tie guys going across the
shins.

2687
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:34,390
He's going across the,
if he's blocking with his knee,

2688
01:57:34,391 --> 01:57:36,570
he doesn't give a fuck.
He's just kicking through him

2689
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:38,250
everything.
Boom.

2690
01:57:38,251 --> 01:57:39,480
Look at that.
Boom,

2691
01:57:39,481 --> 01:57:42,330
look at that.
He's just walking him down.

2692
01:57:44,490 --> 01:57:45,840
Boom.
And then another one,

2693
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:48,570
no terrifying.
That must be to have that guy walk you

2694
01:57:48,571 --> 01:57:51,440
down like that.
Hands out like that.

2695
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:56,100
They call the fight,
I think is that jt will the referee is a

2696
01:57:56,101 --> 01:57:59,970
famous referee who got it was will and
like all those karate.

2697
01:58:00,030 --> 01:58:01,950
That's Dick Dude.
That's Duke right there.

2698
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:04,870
Now that's not jql.
That's a duke right there.

2699
01:58:04,990 --> 01:58:07,080
Uh,
telling everybody that he didn't think

2700
01:58:07,081 --> 01:58:09,330
that it took a lot of skill to kick
someone's legs.

2701
01:58:11,570 --> 01:58:15,530
I think
rick should've won the fight.

2702
01:58:15,531 --> 01:58:18,120
He had the guy,
big historical stuff.

2703
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:22,520
The way the cookie crumbles tonight.
Let's take a look at the monitor down

2704
01:58:22,521 --> 01:58:22,980
here,
Jeff,

2705
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:26,840
and
became like the man,

2706
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:28,620
look at this.
Bam there,

2707
01:58:28,621 --> 01:58:30,650
you know,
he says buck on his knees to do the same

2708
01:58:30,651 --> 01:58:33,050
type of injury that Angela football
player's career.

2709
01:58:33,610 --> 01:58:36,350
You know,
I don't think it takes much town to kick

2710
01:58:36,351 --> 01:58:38,440
somebody in the legs as you thought.

2711
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:40,180
Those jumping,
what's crazy now eric?

2712
01:58:40,210 --> 01:58:43,710
We're throwing in all deep and real
town.

2713
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:45,303
Well,
it was crazy.

2714
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:47,440
I mean,
Duke I think was only 19 at the time.

2715
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:48,700
You know,
he's changed.

2716
01:58:48,701 --> 01:58:49,570
He's,
he's learned.

2717
01:58:49,571 --> 01:58:52,990
And one of the reasons why he's so good
is because he's open minded,

2718
01:58:53,230 --> 01:58:55,450
but he became a world champion,
more Thai fighter himself,

2719
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:58,780
which is crazy.
It's just like Jujitsu and leg locks.

2720
01:58:58,860 --> 01:59:00,610
I know what I mean.
It's just like that,

2721
01:59:00,910 --> 01:59:03,310
that doesn't take any town.
You're just jumping on a guy's lag,

2722
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:04,090
dude.
All,

2723
01:59:04,090 --> 01:59:05,890
all martial arts techniques that are
effective,

2724
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:08,110
there's still people that don't believe
in certain techniques.

2725
01:59:08,170 --> 01:59:09,790
And the big,
uh,

2726
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:14,710
another big moment for Maury tie in the
history of that martial art was,

2727
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:16,990
uh,
Paul Varland versus Marco.

2728
01:59:16,991 --> 01:59:19,750
Who else?
That's when we saw was UFC seven.

2729
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:23,860
That's when we saw the damn cause before
UFC seven,

2730
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:25,780
everybody was thinking,
okay,

2731
01:59:25,781 --> 01:59:27,900
you can't really do any kind of striking
you.

2732
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:30,100
You,
you have to learn Jujitsu or you will

2733
01:59:30,101 --> 01:59:31,270
lose.
It's going to be,

2734
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:33,880
people were just losing faith in
striking all together,

2735
01:59:33,881 --> 01:59:36,310
like just work on,
um,

2736
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:38,060
uh,
it,

2737
01:59:38,150 --> 01:59:41,050
it was almost like jabs didn't even work
back then.

2738
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:44,020
Like who throws a jab in mma?
You're going to get taken down and get

2739
01:59:44,021 --> 01:59:46,180
choked out.
And UFC seven,

2740
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:48,040
that's when we learned,
okay,

2741
01:59:48,190 --> 01:59:52,520
leg leg kicks work.
You got to 300 pounds.

2742
01:59:52,521 --> 01:59:53,620
Yeah.
That changed everything.

2743
01:59:53,621 --> 01:59:55,660
Yeah.
Portland's violence was huge.

2744
01:59:55,661 --> 01:59:57,310
The polar bear there.
Call them tech.

2745
01:59:57,311 --> 01:59:59,790
I was gigantic.
And Marco who washes took his legs

2746
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:02,500
and then marco,
who was,

2747
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:06,490
he also beat revco par do that judo
champion.

2748
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:09,210
You remember he mounted them and then
tap.

2749
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:10,083
He goes,
it's over.

2750
02:00:10,150 --> 02:00:13,390
Once you get them out.
That's what he thought.

2751
02:00:13,391 --> 02:00:14,530
That's it.
That is what he thought.

2752
02:00:14,531 --> 02:00:16,030
Isn't that crazy?
Look at this marco.

2753
02:00:16,031 --> 02:00:18,100
Who else would get heel hooks on people
and shit?

2754
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:19,750
Who's he fighting?
Says,

2755
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:22,360
yeah,
I get some in the heel hook right here

2756
02:00:22,361 --> 02:00:25,510
for this.
I think this is the first he'll hook in.

2757
02:00:25,511 --> 02:00:28,030
The UFC.
Might've been if it wasn't him,

2758
02:00:28,031 --> 02:00:28,864
it was,
um,

2759
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:29,710
oh,
that's amazing.

2760
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:30,460
Oh,
wait a minute.

2761
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:33,250
Wait a minute.
Maybe he Ken Shamrock against Patrick

2762
02:00:33,250 --> 02:00:33,790
Smith.
Yes.

2763
02:00:33,790 --> 02:00:35,770
I don't know if that was a heel and
ankle walk.

2764
02:00:36,330 --> 02:00:37,500
[inaudible]

2765
02:00:38,110 --> 02:00:39,430
I dunno.
A heel hook.

2766
02:00:39,630 --> 02:00:41,860
Yeah.
Ken probably had the first ever leg lock

2767
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:43,360
and then I was going to say,
oh look,

2768
02:00:43,361 --> 02:00:45,520
tech tar off didn't all that gets him
heal hooks.

2769
02:00:45,850 --> 02:00:48,640
He got a knee bar and a straight ankle
lock I think.

2770
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:54,080
Oh old school son.
Old Kinda mma show revealing old fights.

2771
02:00:55,660 --> 02:00:58,330
Man King in the streets,
baby.

2772
02:00:58,660 --> 02:01:03,660
Give me five Paul Paul Varland.
It's v a are viral and you were talking

2773
02:01:04,091 --> 02:01:06,760
to Eric Apple about his old days
sparring with Marco.

2774
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:11,170
They would spar Brazilian style,
get ready for concussions.

2775
02:01:12,310 --> 02:01:13,120
It's just,
yeah,

2776
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:14,640
it didn't matter if you get your nose
broken,

2777
02:01:14,660 --> 02:01:17,740
get back in there like everybody was
just going to war.

2778
02:01:18,190 --> 02:01:21,760
That's what dad,
everyone was scared to death of back in

2779
02:01:21,761 --> 02:01:24,310
the early days and I was a white belt
ever.

2780
02:01:24,370 --> 02:01:29,370
You hear about health gracie school up
in it's Paul violence versus that Marco,

2781
02:01:29,711 --> 02:01:32,710
who was versus that's Paul violence
fighting.

2782
02:01:32,711 --> 02:01:36,430
It looks like in a pre UFC fight or
maybe after his UFC career.

2783
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:40,220
He was,
he was a master of was it trapped?

2784
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:41,080
Fighting?
I Dunno.

2785
02:01:41,081 --> 02:01:43,770
I think it was trapped and that you're
really,

2786
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:45,500
there it is right there at the top.
It's the UFC.

2787
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:47,840
UFC.
He wore a singlet.

2788
02:01:47,870 --> 02:01:50,960
Remember he wore a wrestling singlet?
Yeah.

2789
02:01:51,410 --> 02:01:52,400
Like look,
he's six.

2790
02:01:52,401 --> 02:01:54,290
Seven.
Can you get this big fella?

2791
02:01:54,380 --> 02:01:56,530
Can you wear those singlets anymore?
You can't write.

2792
02:01:56,540 --> 02:01:57,440
No.
Why not?

2793
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:58,880
Uh,
it's a good question.

2794
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:01,730
Girls can,
well actually it looks like he's got

2795
02:02:01,731 --> 02:02:03,680
different colored shorts on or is that
the Monitor?

2796
02:02:04,130 --> 02:02:07,040
So he's a tank top.
Is a tank top on?

2797
02:02:07,190 --> 02:02:10,190
He's fighting with a tank top on.
It's not even a single it right.

2798
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:12,290
It looks like a singlet.
It a little bit,

2799
02:02:12,291 --> 02:02:14,270
but doesn't look like different colors.
Well,

2800
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:17,270
maybe you're right.
Maybe it's just we're seeing his legs

2801
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:20,120
and yeah,
it probably is going to the last minute.

2802
02:02:20,130 --> 02:02:22,130
It has a phone.
The last minute of the fight,

2803
02:02:22,131 --> 02:02:23,360
that's where he chops him down.

2804
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,980
He just chopped him down there with the
first one.

2805
02:02:25,010 --> 02:02:27,980
Boom.
He's so much smaller than I look how

2806
02:02:27,981 --> 02:02:30,410
small Marco is in comparison to Marco's
a bit guy.

2807
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:33,920
Boom.
See Paul violence doesn't have any idea

2808
02:02:33,921 --> 02:02:34,830
what to do here.
So he,

2809
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:36,950
he just keeps kicking back.
Oh,

2810
02:02:36,951 --> 02:02:39,060
he just touched his leg.
He did.

2811
02:02:39,090 --> 02:02:41,720
Oh boom.
Oh,

2812
02:02:41,721 --> 02:02:43,190
chop them down.
Your fucks now.

2813
02:02:43,191 --> 02:02:46,160
So,
and Marco just got on top of him a trop

2814
02:02:46,161 --> 02:02:47,450
to hammers on them.
Boom.

2815
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:48,950
Boom.
No gloves.

2816
02:02:49,510 --> 02:02:51,170
Yeah.
Old School.

2817
02:02:51,890 --> 02:02:54,020
After that,
everyone started throwing a leg kicks

2818
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:56,240
firmly believe we need to go back to no
gloves.

2819
02:02:56,330 --> 02:02:59,720
Firmly believe.
I can't emphasize it enough.

2820
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:03,520
I think people would get less hurt.
I think you'd,

2821
02:03:03,521 --> 02:03:06,830
it'd be a more realistic,
you got to have Rogan fighting

2822
02:03:06,831 --> 02:03:09,500
championships on an Indian reservation.
I don't think it makes that.

2823
02:03:09,501 --> 02:03:11,090
I mean,
I'm beating a dead horse.

2824
02:03:11,090 --> 02:03:13,280
I know I'm a broken record.
I just don't think it makes sense to

2825
02:03:13,281 --> 02:03:15,320
tape your wrists up.
Your wrists are very vulnerable.

2826
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:18,200
You shouldn't be able to just make a
cast out of them and slam him into

2827
02:03:18,201 --> 02:03:20,450
things.
I feel the same way about your ankles.

2828
02:03:20,690 --> 02:03:22,550
Like,
imagine if you could tape your wrist up

2829
02:03:22,551 --> 02:03:25,280
to the point where nobody or your ankle
up to a point where nobody could ever

2830
02:03:25,281 --> 02:03:27,260
get you in a foot lock cause your ankle
was protected.

2831
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:28,490
That'd be ridiculous,
right?

2832
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:31,400
We'll essentially,
when you get someone in a wrist lock,

2833
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:34,130
what are you doing?
You're pulling against the wrist.

2834
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:36,020
Well,
is that a valid technique?

2835
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:37,970
Okay.
A valid technique like a wrist lock like

2836
02:03:37,971 --> 02:03:39,830
this,
very hard to do when someone's risks is

2837
02:03:39,831 --> 02:03:42,950
taped the fuck up.
When your wrist is really Rocco right

2838
02:03:42,951 --> 02:03:45,080
across here,
it goes all over your knuckles.

2839
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:47,840
It goes all around new arrest.
He goes all around your wrist and makes

2840
02:03:47,841 --> 02:03:50,630
it much more stable.
You can really dig into things.

2841
02:03:50,631 --> 02:03:53,180
It feels way better.
It feels way better to hit things

2842
02:03:53,330 --> 02:03:56,930
because when you don't,
especially like my hand is bigger than

2843
02:03:56,931 --> 02:03:59,660
my wrist,
so if I hit things on either side,

2844
02:03:59,661 --> 02:04:03,050
it'll be like more wobbly.
You want it that you want that bitch

2845
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:04,850
taped up,
you know?

2846
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:07,370
Yeah.
And even if your hand is the exact same

2847
02:04:07,371 --> 02:04:10,190
size as your wrist man,
it's just,

2848
02:04:10,191 --> 02:04:14,060
this is a joint that is a super
articulating look at this wrist and he

2849
02:04:14,061 --> 02:04:17,030
looked at all the stuff your risk does.
Your wrist is crazy.

2850
02:04:17,330 --> 02:04:19,580
It really think about joints is the only
joint like it.

2851
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:22,430
Your knees don't do that shit.
I guess your shoulders are kind of

2852
02:04:22,431 --> 02:04:24,110
crazy,
but your wrists,

2853
02:04:24,470 --> 02:04:28,010
when you're punching,
you would have to develop some serious,

2854
02:04:28,011 --> 02:04:32,270
strengthen your forearms to be able to
be a really effective bare knuckle

2855
02:04:32,271 --> 02:04:32,510
fight.

2856
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:35,540
I mean truly bare knuckle,
no wraps in your hands.

2857
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:38,390
No nothing.
Just truly knuckle you had.

2858
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:41,850
You had also learned that you must punch
things with the top knuckles.

2859
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:44,070
You have to,
and even then you could break them.

2860
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:47,370
But if you start hitting,
people in the jaw are great there with

2861
02:04:47,371 --> 02:04:49,470
this crack,
this fucking thing is just going to

2862
02:04:49,471 --> 02:04:51,540
break.
Hit somebody in the forehead right here,

2863
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:53,160
crack.
It's going to break.

2864
02:04:53,490 --> 02:04:55,050
You're going to break them.
You get elbows,

2865
02:04:55,051 --> 02:04:56,820
break them for sure you're gonna break
up.

2866
02:04:57,480 --> 02:04:59,700
But with those gloves on,
you get away with that shit.

2867
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:01,320
You can get away with that shit and you
could,

2868
02:05:01,350 --> 02:05:05,010
you could pitty pat guys,
you could do that more and just not even

2869
02:05:05,011 --> 02:05:08,250
like tried to find like specific spots.
Just start hitting them.

2870
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:11,190
You can't do that.
You have to make sure you're getting the

2871
02:05:11,191 --> 02:05:12,000
soft tissue.

2872
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,400
You've got to target soft tissue.
You've got to look for the job.

2873
02:05:14,410 --> 02:05:18,420
Bang.
Body appears to the public to be more

2874
02:05:18,421 --> 02:05:19,260
brutal.
Right?

2875
02:05:19,290 --> 02:05:20,520
If you don't,
right.

2876
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:23,220
Listen man,
all you need to do is watch anybody

2877
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:26,550
kicked somebody.
Just think the fact that we let someone

2878
02:05:26,551 --> 02:05:29,610
slammed their fucking Shin into some
dude's face.

2879
02:05:29,850 --> 02:05:34,850
That is watch Jeremy Stevens when Jeremy
Stevens fought Honney j uh,

2880
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:36,900
what's his name?
Honey.

2881
02:05:36,901 --> 02:05:38,100
Jason,
remember honey?

2882
02:05:38,101 --> 02:05:39,480
Jason.
Jeremy Stevens.

2883
02:05:39,481 --> 02:05:42,570
Hi Jason.
It is like the head kick to end all head

2884
02:05:42,571 --> 02:05:43,900
kicks.
I don't remember.

2885
02:05:43,970 --> 02:05:47,520
Oh shut up.
You guys aren't allowed to pull up like

2886
02:05:47,530 --> 02:05:48,630
a,
you'll see footage.

2887
02:05:48,930 --> 02:05:52,190
I wish we could we switch to have a
special exemption from the past.

2888
02:05:52,350 --> 02:05:54,750
Like maybe like promote bypass every
time you use it.

2889
02:05:54,751 --> 02:05:56,250
That would be good.
Great way to promote it.

2890
02:05:56,251 --> 02:05:58,260
Right?
They would let us thing one time,

2891
02:05:58,261 --> 02:06:00,120
like they reached out and said like
here's an account,

2892
02:06:00,121 --> 02:06:01,170
but then they never responded.

2893
02:06:01,210 --> 02:06:01,880
I was like,
okay,

2894
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:04,200
let and then,
but that'd be a great way to promote it.

2895
02:06:04,210 --> 02:06:05,820
But yeah,
I'll talk to the UFC.

2896
02:06:05,821 --> 02:06:07,770
I'll try to see what we can get done on
your show.

2897
02:06:07,771 --> 02:06:12,400
You could talk about fights and and have
no issues with pulling up the awesome.

2898
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:15,240
That would be huge for them.
That would,

2899
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:17,650
it's free.
They don't pay me for this and that's,

2900
02:06:17,670 --> 02:06:20,700
that's how people would do it at home.
Maybe hanging out with their friends

2901
02:06:20,701 --> 02:06:21,211
going,
fuck,

2902
02:06:21,211 --> 02:06:22,870
remember that one fight.
Put It on fine.

2903
02:06:22,900 --> 02:06:24,390
You coming in New York this weekend
anyway?

2904
02:06:24,450 --> 02:06:25,680
No.
Come to New York.

2905
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:26,600
No,
no.

2906
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:28,890
Cause I gotta be there the next week.
Anyways,

2907
02:06:28,891 --> 02:06:30,810
I got to go to Brooklyn again the
following weekend.

2908
02:06:31,750 --> 02:06:34,710
Geo is fighting Gordon Ryan's brother.
Oh Shit.

2909
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:36,180
That's been,
that's going to be amazing.

2910
02:06:36,181 --> 02:06:37,260
It's going to be awesome,
man.

2911
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:40,410
Those guys are awesome.
I love the level of Jujitsu that's

2912
02:06:40,411 --> 02:06:41,310
available right now.

2913
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:44,640
It's way better than ever.
I mean,

2914
02:06:44,910 --> 02:06:49,910
the level of just the purple belts these
days would destroy purple belts of like

2915
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:51,570
eight years ago.
Amazing.

2916
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:53,870
It's crazy.
And it keeps going up and up to,

2917
02:06:54,330 --> 02:06:57,740
I was watching some videos today online.
Instagram's huge.

2918
02:06:57,741 --> 02:07:01,140
The loop when you watch a technique and
you can just watch it over and over

2919
02:07:01,141 --> 02:07:02,020
again.
Exactly.

2920
02:07:02,021 --> 02:07:03,180
Yeah.
That makes,

2921
02:07:03,181 --> 02:07:06,270
that accelerates the learning process so
much.

2922
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:09,990
I was watching a clip today.
I washed it like 15 times in a row.

2923
02:07:10,350 --> 02:07:14,100
It was,
I'm a Cyborg during that Tornado guard

2924
02:07:14,101 --> 02:07:15,230
pass,
uh,

2925
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:19,860
on some big giant Dude Cyborg Bjj I
think is this thing.

2926
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:22,920
He hit this giant dude with that tornado
sweep,

2927
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:23,641
you know,
he does that.

2928
02:07:23,641 --> 02:07:26,220
He gets under you and spins and rolls
over.

2929
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:28,890
Very,
very interesting to watch be people can

2930
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:30,630
do that.
That's so strong.

2931
02:07:31,230 --> 02:07:33,150
But that's what his post was about.

2932
02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:37,630
His posters about technique.
And is that like your technique is like

2933
02:07:37,631 --> 02:07:39,790
the steering wheel,
but your strength is the engine?

2934
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:40,780
Yes.
I believe that.

2935
02:07:40,781 --> 02:07:44,350
I believe that too.
I mean every top pro athlete has a

2936
02:07:44,351 --> 02:07:46,730
serious strength and conditioning
program.

2937
02:07:46,731 --> 02:07:48,650
You look at Gordon Ryan's body.
Yeah.

2938
02:07:48,730 --> 02:07:51,160
Well that kid's body,
that kids our goal.

2939
02:07:51,170 --> 02:07:54,910
Rilla you know it's not,
it's not a coincidence that he's jacked

2940
02:07:54,911 --> 02:07:58,470
as fuck and has awesome technique and
taps.

2941
02:07:58,471 --> 02:08:02,140
Cyborg.
You think about how good Cyborg as then

2942
02:08:02,141 --> 02:08:05,380
think about him tap and Cyborg and tap
them pretty handedly.

2943
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:07,930
That sweet man,
boom,

2944
02:08:07,931 --> 02:08:11,680
that was Orlando Sanchez is 300 pounds.
Exactly.

2945
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:14,360
That's why it's crazy.
That's why it's quite quick.

2946
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:15,540
Big that sits there.
Look at this suite.

2947
02:08:15,570 --> 02:08:20,500
We get a sweep leg up in the air and a
hand to foot in between the legs and

2948
02:08:20,501 --> 02:08:21,880
then he pushes the hip with his hand.

2949
02:08:21,910 --> 02:08:24,250
That's one of the greatest sweeps of all
time.

2950
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:25,690
Of all time.
The Shit.

2951
02:08:25,691 --> 02:08:26,560
Look,
look at this.

2952
02:08:26,590 --> 02:08:30,580
So he gets hunger.
He using his foot as he tucks him under

2953
02:08:30,850 --> 02:08:33,220
and pushes him.
I'd like to know what the amazing like

2954
02:08:33,221 --> 02:08:35,620
to know where the left hand is left hand
on the hip.

2955
02:08:35,621 --> 02:08:38,530
Watch how he rolls when he rolls him.
Watched his left hand,

2956
02:08:38,690 --> 02:08:40,390
his right hand on top of the left hand
seat on the hip.

2957
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:42,210
See it pushing where?
Hushing hip though.

2958
02:08:42,220 --> 02:08:43,780
Like it looks.
It's hard.

2959
02:08:43,790 --> 02:08:46,120
It's right here.
You probably just getting anything that

2960
02:08:46,121 --> 02:08:47,080
he can.
It's flat.

2961
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:50,020
If you look at the way w w what was he?
The left hand.

2962
02:08:50,070 --> 02:08:52,300
His left hamstring has got to be so
strong.

2963
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:53,590
Oh Dude.
He's a gorilla.

2964
02:08:53,591 --> 02:08:55,030
Left hamstring.
Insane.

2965
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:56,140
Right?
But he is excellent.

2966
02:08:56,141 --> 02:08:59,850
Even just a hamstring cause he looks to
me like his foot sideways and he'd

2967
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:00,130
watching.

2968
02:09:00,130 --> 02:09:00,791
He does it again.
Look,

2969
02:09:00,791 --> 02:09:02,920
it's foot is sideways like a sidekick.
Look,

2970
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:06,370
look at that.
I mean it's like he's going against the

2971
02:09:06,371 --> 02:09:09,100
inside of the leg.
This is what's even crazier.

2972
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:12,970
The strain is like the abductor muscles.
He's going like this way.

2973
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:16,330
That's another look at,
look at his left leg blocking dude's

2974
02:09:16,331 --> 02:09:17,830
left arm ours,
right?

2975
02:09:17,831 --> 02:09:18,670
Like I'm sorry,
the right leg.

2976
02:09:18,700 --> 02:09:19,240
Right,
right.

2977
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:20,440
Yeah.
It's amazing.

2978
02:09:20,650 --> 02:09:24,400
Yeah.
And that guy he just swept is an adcc

2979
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:28,150
gold medalist and 300 pounds and he's a
really good wrestler.

2980
02:09:28,151 --> 02:09:32,110
He's a black belt in Jujitsu.
That right then that shit that he should

2981
02:09:32,111 --> 02:09:34,950
just leave that on a loop at of school.
Yeah.

2982
02:09:34,951 --> 02:09:36,100
You know what I mean?
Well,

2983
02:09:36,101 --> 02:09:38,300
cyborgs of gorilla.
He's got an ma.

2984
02:09:38,330 --> 02:09:40,360
Did you see ever see it as strength and
conditioning routines?

2985
02:09:41,170 --> 02:09:43,570
I know that motherfucker doesn't play,
dude.

2986
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:44,740
He's a real law.

2987
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:47,110
He's a goal.
All the top guy.

2988
02:09:47,290 --> 02:09:50,560
Oh yeah.
I just saw a Andra Galvao doing dead

2989
02:09:50,570 --> 02:09:52,160
lifts today.
Yes,

2990
02:09:52,900 --> 02:09:53,561
garage.
He,

2991
02:09:53,561 --> 02:09:56,130
let me ask you this.
Is it better to just let the deadline,

2992
02:09:56,140 --> 02:09:57,580
I was going to ask you that because of
that.

2993
02:09:57,670 --> 02:10:00,700
When he dead lifts,
is that best way to do it?

2994
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:01,571
You tell me.
I don't know.

2995
02:10:01,571 --> 02:10:02,620
Shit.
I don't know shit either.

2996
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:05,080
I would always think that the negatives
are important.

2997
02:10:05,110 --> 02:10:06,820
I mean the negatives for me are very
important.

2998
02:10:06,821 --> 02:10:10,570
Like for Chin ups,
I go way slower going down.

2999
02:10:10,571 --> 02:10:14,140
It seems like every six months there's a
whole new philosophy on I'm strength I

3000
02:10:14,141 --> 02:10:15,760
can.
It's totally the opposite of the last

3001
02:10:15,761 --> 02:10:16,630
one.
So crazy.

3002
02:10:16,830 --> 02:10:19,810
It's like now the big thing is,
you know with intermittent fasting it's

3003
02:10:19,811 --> 02:10:20,381
like,
okay,

3004
02:10:20,381 --> 02:10:23,950
there's all these diets and eat this and
gluten that and all that and then now

3005
02:10:23,951 --> 02:10:27,130
the new diet is donated for 18 hours and
no,

3006
02:10:27,131 --> 02:10:29,080
it's not crazy.
That is crazy,

3007
02:10:29,260 --> 02:10:30,460
dude.
That shit works.

3008
02:10:30,461 --> 02:10:34,380
You know what's great about that is it
makes you have

3009
02:10:34,510 --> 02:10:39,510
a time every day where you can have the
most fabulous meal ever.

3010
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:41,330
Cause when I,
when I eat,

3011
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:46,600
I'm starving and salads taste.
So good luck.

3012
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:49,750
I want a big key.
I of a double salad.

3013
02:10:50,170 --> 02:10:51,590
Yeah.
And when you're not,

3014
02:10:51,650 --> 02:10:54,020
when you're not that hungry,
it fee it now.

3015
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:57,290
Now I feel like if I'm not that hungry,
I don't want to waste a meal because

3016
02:10:57,320 --> 02:11:01,280
it's so much better when you're starving
and you're out of control.

3017
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:03,740
Yeah.
I eat that way most of the time,

3018
02:11:03,741 --> 02:11:07,340
except on days when I know I have a
really brutal workout in the morning,

3019
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:10,070
like a weight lift and work.
I'll run fasted,

3020
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:12,950
I'll do yoga fasted.
But if I'm going to lift,

3021
02:11:13,430 --> 02:11:16,160
I want to have something I need.
I need some fruit or some,

3022
02:11:16,161 --> 02:11:19,730
it's almost three right now.
I haven't eaten at all and I'm fine.

3023
02:11:19,731 --> 02:11:22,130
I'm fine.
You know,

3024
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:23,150
it's a,
it's a,

3025
02:11:23,151 --> 02:11:25,550
it's um,
interesting diet.

3026
02:11:25,700 --> 02:11:28,610
I hope it isn't bullshit.
No,

3027
02:11:28,611 --> 02:11:31,400
it's definitely not bullshit.
I was never a morning person either.

3028
02:11:31,401 --> 02:11:34,370
Like I never did.
I never really looked forward to

3029
02:11:34,371 --> 02:11:37,730
breakfast was always add and have I got
protein bar or something just cause I

3030
02:11:37,731 --> 02:11:39,950
had to,
did you ever listen to my podcast?

3031
02:11:39,951 --> 02:11:43,850
I did with Dom D'agostino.
He's a scientist from,

3032
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,120
I think he's University of Florida.
Um,

3033
02:11:46,150 --> 02:11:48,620
but uh,
a key to genic specialist does a lot of

3034
02:11:48,621 --> 02:11:52,850
Quito research and research on fasting
and the benefits of fasting and he goes

3035
02:11:52,851 --> 02:11:55,520
into the scientific benefits,
the proven benefits of fasting.

3036
02:11:55,820 --> 02:11:57,050
Very,
very interesting stuff.

3037
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:57,770
What did he,
what were,

3038
02:11:57,770 --> 02:12:00,950
what were the most I would really want
to direct you to that.

3039
02:12:00,951 --> 02:12:05,570
I want to fuck it up,
but it's for a preventative cancer.

3040
02:12:05,630 --> 02:12:06,463
Um,
yeah.

3041
02:12:06,470 --> 02:12:10,130
Ketone bodies in the blood and crease
cognitive improvements.

3042
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:11,600
I just think we eat too much.

3043
02:12:12,070 --> 02:12:14,470
We eat too much meat all the time.
So easy to know.

3044
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:16,980
I like watching TV and snacking,
you know,

3045
02:12:17,110 --> 02:12:20,270
watch a little netflix snacks.
We all do.

3046
02:12:20,660 --> 02:12:22,940
But if I'm watching Netflix and it's
nine o'clock at night,

3047
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:26,870
I really shouldn't be eating.
Isn't it weird that like popcorn became

3048
02:12:26,871 --> 02:12:30,230
the official food watching movies?
Isn't that weird?

3049
02:12:30,470 --> 02:12:33,530
I know it's loud chewing shit.
You can't hear dialogue and have no one

3050
02:12:33,531 --> 02:12:34,364
likes to say,
dude,

3051
02:12:34,570 --> 02:12:36,020
let's go get some popcorn.
No one,

3052
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:39,380
no one ever looks for popcorn and less
they're at the movies.

3053
02:12:39,410 --> 02:12:41,510
That's a good point.
What is it only time?

3054
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:45,650
Maybe a Disneyland because it's like,
Yay,

3055
02:12:45,651 --> 02:12:48,170
I forgot about popcorn.
Fucking and by that while I'm here too.

3056
02:12:48,740 --> 02:12:50,480
Other than that,
like the circus movie,

3057
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:51,690
circus,
circus,

3058
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:54,110
popcorn,
circus got peanuts into the mix.

3059
02:12:54,230 --> 02:12:57,710
Maybe there's something about the
popcorn that like it's like genetically

3060
02:12:57,711 --> 02:13:00,530
modified and it's like it helps with
the,

3061
02:13:00,740 --> 02:13:03,050
with the brainwashing just in the palm
court.

3062
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:05,330
Yeah,
probably do up to microwave,

3063
02:13:05,331 --> 02:13:06,164
dude.
That's what it is.

3064
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:08,870
They might exact curls and it fucks with
your head Bro.

3065
02:13:10,390 --> 02:13:12,620
Basically microwave,
just kill everything.

3066
02:13:12,621 --> 02:13:13,790
Right.
When you might go into your food,

3067
02:13:13,791 --> 02:13:16,250
you basically just don't have anything.
It's just like,

3068
02:13:16,450 --> 02:13:17,260
yeah,
pop,

3069
02:13:17,260 --> 02:13:17,910
pop.
I'm not hung.

3070
02:13:17,910 --> 02:13:19,290
Survived in a way.
Right.

3071
02:13:19,630 --> 02:13:22,560
Isn't it crazy that we haven't really
improved upon micro?

3072
02:13:22,561 --> 02:13:26,360
It's like they mastered that shit 40
years ago and it's still the same

3073
02:13:26,361 --> 02:13:28,550
goddamn micro.
I know it's really bad for you and

3074
02:13:28,551 --> 02:13:30,620
they're going to take out of microwave
popcorn.

3075
02:13:30,621 --> 02:13:32,100
When you get popcorn,

3076
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:35,580
there's fats in there that your body
just doesn't know what the fuck to do

3077
02:13:35,581 --> 02:13:37,200
with.
That's where those things could sit on a

3078
02:13:37,201 --> 02:13:39,120
shelf for so long.
Those little packets,

3079
02:13:39,780 --> 02:13:40,740
I think,
what is it?

3080
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:44,340
What is the toxic ingredient in
microwave popcorn that they're

3081
02:13:44,341 --> 02:13:45,810
eliminating?
It's hilarious.

3082
02:13:45,811 --> 02:13:46,541
They decided,
Oh,

3083
02:13:46,541 --> 02:13:48,630
this shit kills you,
but we're going to let you sell it for

3084
02:13:48,631 --> 02:13:52,710
two more years.
They didn't just make it illegal.

3085
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:55,020
They made a moratorium.
I think it's trans fats.

3086
02:13:55,021 --> 02:13:58,740
I think it just might be a vegetable.
Oil Fats.

3087
02:13:58,770 --> 02:14:01,110
There's certain certain trans fats that
are just,

3088
02:14:01,140 --> 02:14:05,210
your body's just like,
what in the fuck is this non food?

3089
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:07,110
You're,
you're making me.

3090
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:10,530
Yeah.
We were talking about delicious protein

3091
02:14:10,531 --> 02:14:13,320
bars before the show.
That gives you the most unbelievable

3092
02:14:13,321 --> 02:14:15,660
farts.
That's how I know I shouldn't be eating,

3093
02:14:15,670 --> 02:14:18,390
so if I'm,
if I'm eating something and I'm just

3094
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:22,110
lighten the inside of my car on fire
chemical here it is.

3095
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:26,160
Chemicals used in aligning of
microwaveable popcorn bags including

3096
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:31,280
look per fluoro.
[inaudible]

3097
02:14:31,890 --> 02:14:36,210
acid or Pfo are part of a class of
compounds that may be linked to

3098
02:14:36,211 --> 02:14:39,030
infertility and humans.
According to a recent study from Ucla

3099
02:14:39,210 --> 02:14:41,700
and animal testing,
the chemicals caused liver cancer,

3100
02:14:41,701 --> 02:14:45,030
tech,
testicular cancer and pancreatic cancer.

3101
02:14:45,450 --> 02:14:48,750
So that's one thing,
but I know that they banned trans fats.

3102
02:14:48,751 --> 02:14:51,040
I might have conflated the two stories.
Did that,

3103
02:14:51,130 --> 02:14:54,570
cause what is the ban of trans fats is
the one where they're giving them like

3104
02:14:54,571 --> 02:14:59,571
all the like hostess cakes,
those bullshit cakes that sit on the

3105
02:14:59,731 --> 02:15:02,370
shelf forever.
Ding dongs are my favorite.

3106
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,720
Those things,
those,

3107
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:07,070
those pop,
those pie cakes that you get from hosted

3108
02:15:07,071 --> 02:15:10,800
to like the lemon filling,
those are just trans fats to the gills.

3109
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:14,370
Twinkie method.
They last 20 years or whatever.

3110
02:15:14,700 --> 02:15:19,170
How long do they last?
Twinkie like you and I were laying

3111
02:15:19,171 --> 02:15:21,750
around in fucking bored,
smoked a little weed,

3112
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:23,220
watching some TV and up to God.

3113
02:15:23,220 --> 02:15:24,570
I'm so hungry.
When he got here,

3114
02:15:24,571 --> 02:15:28,800
man cabinet and you had like ring dings,
twinkies and my grab a twinkie.

3115
02:15:28,990 --> 02:15:32,820
If I'm starving laying around watching
survival chillin,

3116
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:36,060
I might eat a twinkie.
These are like the worst wedding cake.

3117
02:15:36,240 --> 02:15:36,811
It's just,
well,

3118
02:15:36,811 --> 02:15:39,060
you know what I had last night at
strawberry shortcake,

3119
02:15:39,210 --> 02:15:44,040
US popcorn makers could face long,
expensive road to lose trans fats.

3120
02:15:44,580 --> 02:15:46,950
Okay?
This is why I conflated it.

3121
02:15:47,130 --> 02:15:50,580
Microwave popcorn makers could face a
long and difficult task.

3122
02:15:50,820 --> 02:15:55,050
Ridding their snacks of trans fats,
US Food and Drug Administration proposal

3123
02:15:55,051 --> 02:15:59,520
to ban the additive goes into effect.
So you s is banning.

3124
02:15:59,521 --> 02:16:02,880
So the u s ban on Trans Fats is what I
uh,

3125
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:07,280
what I got confused with us ban on trans
fats is like a,

3126
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:09,390
they're given these people like two
years.

3127
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:12,840
Isn't it crazy that they're there?
They're going to make it a big deal out

3128
02:16:12,841 --> 02:16:13,140
of this.

3129
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:15,990
They're going after the trans fats,
but they don't go after like,

3130
02:16:16,140 --> 02:16:17,640
like,
like real shit.

3131
02:16:17,641 --> 02:16:21,030
Like alcohol is like killing people all
day every day.

3132
02:16:21,031 --> 02:16:21,631
I know,
right?

3133
02:16:21,631 --> 02:16:22,770
It's like you,
you say,

3134
02:16:22,950 --> 02:16:25,260
why don't you say this is going to kill
you if you keep eating it,

3135
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:28,020
but it's awesome but you're going after
trans fats.

3136
02:16:28,270 --> 02:16:31,030
Maybe it's like someone,
someone in the popcorn industry just

3137
02:16:31,031 --> 02:16:33,580
pissed off and I illuminati Mammogram,
you know where to go after him.

3138
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:35,140
And this,
is this like a smear campaign?

3139
02:16:35,270 --> 02:16:37,230
Trans Fats,
danger?

3140
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:39,040
No,
they're bad for you once they know

3141
02:16:39,041 --> 02:16:41,200
they're bad for you.
But what about just take him,

3142
02:16:41,380 --> 02:16:44,590
what about the,
that one drug that everyone's getting

3143
02:16:44,591 --> 02:16:46,550
addicted to that's legal.
Uh,

3144
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:48,010
adderall.
No,

3145
02:16:48,011 --> 02:16:49,150
it's,
it's a Carolyn.

3146
02:16:49,420 --> 02:16:51,270
It's morphine.
No,

3147
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:53,380
no,
no.

3148
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:56,200
Very popular.
Very popular prescription.

3149
02:16:57,190 --> 02:17:00,190
Oxycontin.
Oxycontin for sure.

3150
02:17:00,310 --> 02:17:03,880
Fuck your life up 100% but he have
serious pain.

3151
02:17:03,881 --> 02:17:06,220
It also leaves yeates pain.
And the thing is,

3152
02:17:06,221 --> 02:17:08,460
can you,
can you just write it for a few and

3153
02:17:08,461 --> 02:17:11,020
they're going after trans fats here.
It's crazy.

3154
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:14,830
Let them have their popcorn.
Fuck Aa.

3155
02:17:14,831 --> 02:17:17,140
They're going,
they're making like news articles about

3156
02:17:17,141 --> 02:17:18,790
it.
[inaudible] after Trans Fat.

3157
02:17:18,940 --> 02:17:21,400
What about the 800 kids that go missing
every year?

3158
02:17:21,460 --> 02:17:22,520
What about,
why don't you cold weld?

3159
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:24,650
Different people go look for that.
Okay,

3160
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:26,380
that's true.
But these are different people.

3161
02:17:26,381 --> 02:17:30,340
These are food scientists.
But I think the point is that this stuff

3162
02:17:30,370 --> 02:17:32,530
that there's other ways to make food,
but the thing is,

3163
02:17:32,531 --> 02:17:34,630
I don't know what is the benefits of
Trans Fats?

3164
02:17:34,631 --> 02:17:36,340
Does it make processing easier?
Like,

3165
02:17:36,341 --> 02:17:39,190
why do they use that as opposed to like
other healthy fats?

3166
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:42,130
I don't know why.
It probably has something to do with

3167
02:17:42,131 --> 02:17:43,750
shelf life maybe.
Yes,

3168
02:17:43,780 --> 02:17:45,790
probably.
That's probably why it fucks you up too.

3169
02:17:46,180 --> 02:17:47,950
You got to think about what a
preservative is.

3170
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:49,810
You know,
like someone was explaining,

3171
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:50,790
did you see,
uh,

3172
02:17:50,830 --> 02:17:52,780
what's wrong with wheat or what's with
wheat?

3173
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:56,230
Did you see that documentary?
Maybe they were talking about roundup

3174
02:17:56,231 --> 02:17:58,990
and glyphosate and they were talking
about roundup,

3175
02:17:59,020 --> 02:18:01,810
this stuff that they spray on some
plants that they said,

3176
02:18:01,811 --> 02:18:04,960
well don't worry,
this only affects a bacteria.

3177
02:18:05,030 --> 02:18:06,750
Yeah,
and so they said that,

3178
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:07,211
well,
this one,

3179
02:18:07,211 --> 02:18:09,820
they were creating it and this is one of
the reasons why they allowed it to be

3180
02:18:09,821 --> 02:18:11,320
used,
but what they are explaining in this

3181
02:18:11,321 --> 02:18:12,430
documentary,
it's just,

3182
02:18:12,431 --> 02:18:14,860
I don't know if it's true or not,
but what they were explaining was,

3183
02:18:14,980 --> 02:18:17,050
yeah,
you have bacteria in your body dummy.

3184
02:18:17,350 --> 02:18:19,150
Like you're taking this stuff into your
body.

3185
02:18:19,151 --> 02:18:21,640
They didn't say it that way.
You have bacteria in your body.

3186
02:18:21,641 --> 02:18:24,070
You're taking this stuff into your body
that only kills bacteria.

3187
02:18:24,250 --> 02:18:28,570
It's going to kill a part of your body.
Like your body is partly bacteria.

3188
02:18:28,690 --> 02:18:31,000
In fact,
there's more bacteria cells in your body

3189
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:32,320
than there are human cells.

3190
02:18:32,630 --> 02:18:36,850
That's just a fact of being a person.
So this is a crazy thing that they don't

3191
02:18:36,851 --> 02:18:40,930
know that and they either know it and
they did it anyway or they didn't know

3192
02:18:40,931 --> 02:18:43,300
that in which the case,
what you were saying earlier,

3193
02:18:43,330 --> 02:18:46,540
they should have no business telling
people what's the good science and the

3194
02:18:46,541 --> 02:18:48,880
bad science if they allow that to go
through it.

3195
02:18:48,881 --> 02:18:50,680
Yeah.
That's another example of bad science.

3196
02:18:50,700 --> 02:18:53,350
Yeah,
well it's definitely example of maybe

3197
02:18:53,351 --> 02:18:55,930
they didn't know when they first came up
with the stuff,

3198
02:18:56,180 --> 02:19:00,430
but as technology has advanced,
they haven't eliminated it either way.

3199
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:04,360
Whether they didn't know or they did
know and there was a diabolical plan,

3200
02:19:04,450 --> 02:19:05,560
whatever it is,
it's just,

3201
02:19:05,561 --> 02:19:08,890
it's that science is bogus.
Yeah,

3202
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:12,940
but should you be allowed like we know
diet cokes,

3203
02:19:12,941 --> 02:19:15,130
terrible for you.
Should you be allowed to sell diet coke

3204
02:19:15,970 --> 02:19:18,100
if you want,
but just most do most people know how

3205
02:19:18,101 --> 02:19:20,800
bad diet coke is for you or Diet Soda?

3206
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:23,380
I should say the most people know.
Most people don't.

3207
02:19:24,010 --> 02:19:25,540
Most people don't.
They don't know.

3208
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:28,100
Mostly Park.
I'll have a diet every now and again

3209
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:30,410
once a month or so I'll have a diet
coke.

3210
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:33,640
I been pretty good at keeping sodas at
my life now.

3211
02:19:33,870 --> 02:19:35,450
We discovered a,
the Pellegrino.

3212
02:19:36,130 --> 02:19:37,790
Yeah.
Pellegrinos great.

3213
02:19:37,900 --> 02:19:38,870
Yeah,
just water.

3214
02:19:39,860 --> 02:19:44,150
I love it.
I used to struggle with being at a

3215
02:19:44,270 --> 02:19:48,290
restaurant and you're struggling with,
should I just drink water or can I get a

3216
02:19:48,291 --> 02:19:49,790
fucking,
I'm gonna have a coke and then I have to

3217
02:19:49,791 --> 02:19:52,380
coax and then I feel guilty all night.
Uh,

3218
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:55,120
that struggle went on my whole life,
dude.

3219
02:19:55,160 --> 02:19:56,510
I been drinking way too much.
Water.

3220
02:19:56,660 --> 02:20:00,950
Pellegrino,
the Pellegrino that tie that in Perrier,

3221
02:20:00,951 --> 02:20:03,950
that,
that satisfies me enough.

3222
02:20:04,370 --> 02:20:07,010
ZV is a good one too.
And um,

3223
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:09,420
there's a couple of other like flavored
waters.

3224
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:10,850
They're like more carbonated.

3225
02:20:11,210 --> 02:20:12,800
It's carbonated water.
Ah,

3226
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:15,710
the Cla,
the Cla is Pellegrino and carbonated

3227
02:20:15,711 --> 02:20:16,940
waters.
Is that bad for you?

3228
02:20:16,941 --> 02:20:20,030
Is that gonna is that gonna come out
that we get cancer from that are the

3229
02:20:20,031 --> 02:20:23,690
bubbles fucking me up.
They are not good for your teeth.

3230
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:25,250
What do they do?
The bubbles,

3231
02:20:25,630 --> 02:20:26,930
just as bad as soda.
Water is.

3232
02:20:26,931 --> 02:20:30,450
I mean it's just not good for your,
it's soda isn't Pellegrino has settled

3233
02:20:30,460 --> 02:20:31,640
water.
It's the same thing.

3234
02:20:31,910 --> 02:20:35,420
And carbonated water is bad for your
teeth and mass amounts.

3235
02:20:35,421 --> 02:20:37,310
I mean like one or two,
probably not a bad thing.

3236
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:40,580
So we'll just drink it about once it
gets in your stomach that do the

3237
02:20:40,581 --> 02:20:43,310
bubbles,
do the bubbles like fuck you up.

3238
02:20:43,311 --> 02:20:44,840
Gas,
Illuminati Bro.

3239
02:20:44,841 --> 02:20:46,330
They're all ideas.
Those,

3240
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:50,750
those ideas in those bubbles getting you
to buy into bonds.

3241
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:51,871
Who knows?
Who knows?

3242
02:20:51,871 --> 02:20:54,330
Maybe maybe they find out that the
bubble of your guns,

3243
02:20:54,340 --> 02:20:57,110
your system do something,
uh,

3244
02:20:57,111 --> 02:20:57,944
bad for Ya.

3245
02:20:58,140 --> 02:20:59,150
Yeah,
right.

3246
02:20:59,240 --> 02:21:00,200
I mean,
I wouldn't be surprised.

3247
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:03,800
I hope not shit out.
It's completely benign because I turned

3248
02:21:03,830 --> 02:21:05,960
her,
we've heard about the shit out of it.

3249
02:21:06,020 --> 02:21:08,630
I do too.
Here along as it's playing carbonated

3250
02:21:08,631 --> 02:21:10,790
water with no added citric acid or
sugar,

3251
02:21:10,791 --> 02:21:13,310
the answer is no.
The process of carbonation is simple.

3252
02:21:13,311 --> 02:21:16,460
Addition of pasteurized,
pressurized carbon dioxide,

3253
02:21:16,461 --> 02:21:19,580
gas into plain water acids,
sugars and salt,

3254
02:21:19,610 --> 02:21:22,790
or not being added.
It's the addition of those ingredients

3255
02:21:22,791 --> 02:21:26,000
that ups your risk for tooth decay.
So no harm at all.

3256
02:21:26,210 --> 02:21:30,650
So it's just carbonated water is just
carbon dioxide gas or maybe that's an

3257
02:21:30,651 --> 02:21:32,060
Illuminati.
Dude,

3258
02:21:32,061 --> 02:21:33,710
stop freaking me out,
man.

3259
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:36,260
Did you know the funguses fucking like
mushrooms?

3260
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:39,560
They breathe in oxygen and breathe out
carbon dioxide like we do.

3261
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:43,520
Does that make it make it good?
It's like an animal more than it is like

3262
02:21:43,521 --> 02:21:44,354
a plant.

3263
02:21:44,420 --> 02:21:46,310
They're closer to animals than they are
to plants.

3264
02:21:46,990 --> 02:21:49,490
A fungus,
fungus or like an animal.

3265
02:21:49,550 --> 02:21:51,830
Almost.
Not really because it doesn't move.

3266
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:54,170
I mean,
but it's closer to the animal wrangler

3267
02:21:54,171 --> 02:21:56,530
moves
shit.

3268
02:21:56,920 --> 02:21:58,610
Yeah.
Fuck that fungus.

3269
02:21:58,700 --> 02:22:00,530
That's the worst man.
That's the worst.

3270
02:22:00,531 --> 02:22:05,360
But like mushrooms are there.
There's some sort of other thing.

3271
02:22:05,540 --> 02:22:08,840
They're not a plant funguses and a
different kind of thing,

3272
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:14,540
uh,
from another fucking planet,

3273
02:22:14,541 --> 02:22:15,374
man.
That's what I think.

3274
02:22:15,470 --> 02:22:18,050
You think mushrooms aren't legal right?
They're not.

3275
02:22:18,110 --> 02:22:21,830
There's that recreational mushrooms are
the ballot for 2000 coming California.

3276
02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:24,290
Any states already legalized my,
but they should.

3277
02:22:24,440 --> 02:22:26,430
They should do it the same way they do
what

3278
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:27,850
they're going to eventually do with
Mtma.

3279
02:22:27,870 --> 02:22:29,010
Look,
mushrooms are great,

3280
02:22:29,650 --> 02:22:32,880
and remember the first time you,
and I remember the first time you and I

3281
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:34,530
did mushrooms,
you were living at your old house.

3282
02:22:34,740 --> 02:22:36,650
We were chilling in the backyard,
dude,

3283
02:22:36,770 --> 02:22:39,750
and we to do the talking about life
wasn't that much.

3284
02:22:39,751 --> 02:22:42,750
It a small dose,
but it was enough to go whoa.

3285
02:22:42,780 --> 02:22:44,580
Like it just gave me a better
perspective.

3286
02:22:44,610 --> 02:22:48,360
It's just opened up my mind to that.
I was,

3287
02:22:48,630 --> 02:22:53,630
I was relying on all the patterns that
had been explained to me about life to

3288
02:22:54,991 --> 02:22:59,250
be correct instead of like looking at it
with fresh eyes.

3289
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:01,890
And I felt like at 30 years old,
it was the first time I was able to look

3290
02:23:01,891 --> 02:23:04,020
at my,
my life with fresh eyes,

3291
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:05,520
look at life itself and go,
oh,

3292
02:23:05,521 --> 02:23:09,300
this is just this weird temporary
experience eating your comedy,

3293
02:23:09,301 --> 02:23:10,110
tear your comedy.

3294
02:23:10,110 --> 02:23:11,460
Just,
you know,

3295
02:23:11,580 --> 02:23:14,430
from,
from the early Joe Rogan,

3296
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:16,980
like your first CD somebody someday I'm
going to be dead.

3297
02:23:16,981 --> 02:23:18,080
Right.
I'm going to be dead someday.

3298
02:23:18,110 --> 02:23:20,970
I'm going to be dead someday.
From that comedy to the once you started

3299
02:23:20,971 --> 02:23:23,730
getting into psychedelics,
big o difference.

3300
02:23:23,790 --> 02:23:25,830
Yeah.
It changes who you are cause well,

3301
02:23:25,831 --> 02:23:30,120
it also makes you super humble because
even if I don't appear humble,

3302
02:23:30,470 --> 02:23:31,171
um,
when you,

3303
02:23:31,171 --> 02:23:34,800
when you get hit by that,
that the big dose,

3304
02:23:34,830 --> 02:23:36,510
whatever it is,
dmt or whatever you do,

3305
02:23:36,511 --> 02:23:39,500
when you get hit by that dose,
you realize you are just a part.

3306
02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:44,040
You're not the big thing.
It is a part of something that is

3307
02:23:44,100 --> 02:23:47,730
indescribably big.
And the idea that you're important or

3308
02:23:47,731 --> 02:23:49,770
that you're the most significant thing
around you,

3309
02:23:49,771 --> 02:23:52,440
it's pretty ridiculous.
Like you gotta do your best to keep your

3310
02:23:52,441 --> 02:23:56,880
body alive and do your best to do your
part and whatever the fuck you do for a

3311
02:23:56,881 --> 02:23:58,200
living,
do your best at that.

3312
02:23:58,200 --> 02:24:01,470
But you're just a part of something
that's infinite.

3313
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:06,590
Did your experience with mushrooms and
Dmt,

3314
02:24:07,290 --> 02:24:11,640
did that make you think like there's
gotta be a creator to all this?

3315
02:24:12,930 --> 02:24:15,420
Not that there's a creator like a guy in
a lab.

3316
02:24:15,630 --> 02:24:20,630
It's like making a person inside of a
fucking yes to not not a creator in a

3317
02:24:20,671 --> 02:24:22,890
sense of an individual,
but I think that the idea of an

3318
02:24:22,891 --> 02:24:25,830
individual became more ridiculous than
anything.

3319
02:24:26,070 --> 02:24:29,550
It's like I understand that like what we
are is almost like something filtered

3320
02:24:29,551 --> 02:24:33,060
through these predetermined like almost
like we're a membrane,

3321
02:24:33,061 --> 02:24:37,890
like something from another dimension
expresses itself through this physical

3322
02:24:37,891 --> 02:24:42,540
membrane and then we're almost like the
barrier to what comes out on the other

3323
02:24:42,541 --> 02:24:45,480
side that this was the thought that I
had when I was on mushrooms,

3324
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:50,780
that what we are as as as a person is
almost like the the carrier,

3325
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:56,900
like a vehicle for whatever a soul is
and that this thing uses this life to

3326
02:24:57,481 --> 02:25:01,050
pass that,
that thing through onto another

3327
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:06,200
experience that happens in the next
dimension that'll be so fucking alien

3328
02:25:06,451 --> 02:25:10,200
that you can't even imagine it today in
this dimension and this dimension would

3329
02:25:10,201 --> 02:25:14,460
be alien to that dimension that it was
just this never ending infinite process

3330
02:25:14,461 --> 02:25:15,570
of soul traveling.

3331
02:25:15,570 --> 02:25:19,350
I had this very bizarre,
like thought about like if you,

3332
02:25:19,410 --> 02:25:22,290
like people will often say like if you
had to live your life over again,

3333
02:25:22,470 --> 02:25:24,100
you are born tomorrow.
You got to do

3334
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:25,270
it all over again.
Could you do it?

3335
02:25:25,271 --> 02:25:26,104
You'd be like,
what?

3336
02:25:26,650 --> 02:25:28,930
Oh my God,
I got to start over from scratch.

3337
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:32,710
How can I be a baby again and rely on
those same fucking people again?

3338
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:34,930
Oh my God,
I got to go back to first grade.

3339
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:38,770
That was terrible.
That's when my parents broke up and Oh,

3340
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:40,240
and people start freaking out and
thinking,

3341
02:25:40,241 --> 02:25:41,920
but you already did it.
You already did it.

3342
02:25:41,921 --> 02:25:44,080
What'd you have to do it forever?
Could you do it forever,

3343
02:25:44,110 --> 02:25:46,960
forever and ever and ever over and over
and over and over and over again.

3344
02:25:47,050 --> 02:25:48,610
Could you do that?
Like reincarnation?

3345
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:52,000
You might be doing that.
That might be just as possible.

3346
02:25:52,001 --> 02:25:52,870
What,
what hit me?

3347
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:56,860
Is this just as possible that you've
lived this life and infinite number of

3348
02:25:56,861 --> 02:25:59,680
times and you can continue to live this
life and in front number of times.

3349
02:25:59,710 --> 02:26:02,230
And when you do,
maybe so you're saying there's a

3350
02:26:02,231 --> 02:26:04,330
possibility that we have some kind of
soul type thing,

3351
02:26:04,331 --> 02:26:06,430
right?
Some kind of sauce ability that you're

3352
02:26:06,431 --> 02:26:08,320
on a loop.
Just like those,

3353
02:26:08,350 --> 02:26:10,750
those youtube videos,
are those a instagram videos,

3354
02:26:10,751 --> 02:26:11,800
a Cyborg hitting that?
Yeah,

3355
02:26:11,950 --> 02:26:13,620
that sweep.
So we're on a lifeline.

3356
02:26:13,830 --> 02:26:16,980
If so,
if there is a loop and it say either,

3357
02:26:17,310 --> 02:26:22,200
either it's involuntary or voluntary.
Either you say either when you die,

3358
02:26:22,201 --> 02:26:23,460
you wake up and go,
Whoa,

3359
02:26:23,461 --> 02:26:25,530
that was an awesome ride.
Let's do it again.

3360
02:26:25,590 --> 02:26:29,220
Or it just happens automatically.
And you did you get the choice either

3361
02:26:29,230 --> 02:26:30,031
way.
Maybe you do,

3362
02:26:30,031 --> 02:26:32,610
maybe you don't.
Some spiritual gurus say that,

3363
02:26:32,611 --> 02:26:34,290
yes,
some people choose,

3364
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:38,490
some souls choose to keep coming back.
Some stay in the infinite heavens

3365
02:26:38,491 --> 02:26:41,280
forever or whatever,
and then come back some every now and

3366
02:26:41,281 --> 02:26:42,540
then,
who knows what's real.

3367
02:26:42,541 --> 02:26:43,530
But,
um,

3368
02:26:43,770 --> 02:26:45,450
you're,
you're talking about there's some kind

3369
02:26:45,451 --> 02:26:48,800
of soul thing and there's either a,
you're pro,

3370
02:26:48,870 --> 02:26:49,261
you're,
you're,

3371
02:26:49,261 --> 02:26:54,020
you're saying that this probably an
involuntary reincarnation of some sort.

3372
02:26:54,090 --> 02:26:55,170
Yeah.
Right.

3373
02:26:55,310 --> 02:26:56,840
So,
so maybe possible.

3374
02:26:56,880 --> 02:27:01,880
Maybe either if,
if you decide to come back for sure.

3375
02:27:03,811 --> 02:27:06,270
If that's the case,
you would,

3376
02:27:06,570 --> 02:27:07,170
you would say,
okay,

3377
02:27:07,170 --> 02:27:09,810
I'm going to,
I'm going back in to that earth realm

3378
02:27:10,410 --> 02:27:15,410
and you for sure don't want to know
where you came from that it would seem,

3379
02:27:16,231 --> 02:27:19,860
I'm guessing that the beauty of life is
after you dying,

3380
02:27:19,880 --> 02:27:20,850
you realize what the hell.

3381
02:27:20,910 --> 02:27:21,743
Oh,
that's right.

3382
02:27:21,930 --> 02:27:24,090
You,
you don't want to know.

3383
02:27:24,091 --> 02:27:25,730
It's like watching a movie.
Like I'm,

3384
02:27:25,740 --> 02:27:29,010
the other day I watched a movie and I'm
watching the trailer and 30 seconds into

3385
02:27:29,011 --> 02:27:32,940
the trailers unsane the movie at 30
seconds I stopped it because I didn't

3386
02:27:32,941 --> 02:27:34,830
want to watch the rest of the trailer
because now,

3387
02:27:34,890 --> 02:27:36,180
okay,
I got enough.

3388
02:27:36,210 --> 02:27:38,610
I want to see this thing.
I didn't want to see more of the trial

3389
02:27:38,730 --> 02:27:40,800
because I wanted to go to the movie and
be full.

3390
02:27:40,801 --> 02:27:44,520
I didn't want to know what was going on.
I wanted to be confused,

3391
02:27:44,580 --> 02:27:45,720
right?
I didn't want to fit,

3392
02:27:45,721 --> 02:27:47,220
be able to figure something out from a
trailer.

3393
02:27:47,490 --> 02:27:49,260
So,
and most people are like that.

3394
02:27:49,261 --> 02:27:51,390
I'm not special.
Like if you went to a movie and you

3395
02:27:51,391 --> 02:27:54,480
already saw your buddy didn't and you
told them how it ended,

3396
02:27:54,481 --> 02:27:56,910
he would sock you right in the chest.
Fuck you doing.

3397
02:27:56,940 --> 02:27:58,560
You just ruined the movie from you.
Faggot.

3398
02:27:58,890 --> 02:27:59,850
You know what I mean?
Strong word.

3399
02:27:59,851 --> 02:28:01,620
But I mean that I don't mean that in a
homosexual.

3400
02:28:01,621 --> 02:28:03,690
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to be funny and I

3401
02:28:03,691 --> 02:28:06,120
apologize to all gay people out there.
I apologize.

3402
02:28:06,121 --> 02:28:07,980
I love gay people.
I love gay people.

3403
02:28:08,470 --> 02:28:10,560
Um,
there was just me trying to express an

3404
02:28:10,561 --> 02:28:12,030
emotion,
but a,

3405
02:28:12,031 --> 02:28:14,550
and no one's also at the same time going
to go to a movie with the,

3406
02:28:14,551 --> 02:28:16,860
have you already signed say dude,
before it starts telling me the whole

3407
02:28:16,861 --> 02:28:18,100
movie.
Better

3408
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:20,410
analogies that you never get a chance to
see the future.

3409
02:28:20,650 --> 02:28:21,980
You're not going to get a chance to see
the future

3410
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:24,410
once you're reborn again.
This life when you come back,

3411
02:28:24,440 --> 02:28:26,450
do you want to have a memory of your
past and you don't,

3412
02:28:26,451 --> 02:28:28,790
you don't get it.
It's a part of the system.

3413
02:28:29,010 --> 02:28:32,210
I think it's either,
whether it's voluntary or involuntary,

3414
02:28:32,480 --> 02:28:36,530
it's best to not know where you came
from at first.

3415
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:41,390
It's best to figure it out.
That's probably what this is all about

3416
02:28:41,391 --> 02:28:43,070
is figuring it out.
Cause when we go to the movie,

3417
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:45,800
part of it is it's all about the
journey.

3418
02:28:45,801 --> 02:28:48,010
It's not about the destination.
People always use that as a,

3419
02:28:48,110 --> 02:28:49,160
you know,
an instagram.

3420
02:28:49,161 --> 02:28:51,500
It's not about the journey or thought
about the destination.

3421
02:28:51,501 --> 02:28:54,500
It's the journey.
That's one of the most popular saying

3422
02:28:54,501 --> 02:28:57,110
it's ever and it's beautiful.
You have to say it every now and then to

3423
02:28:57,111 --> 02:28:58,640
remind you,
remind the rum.

3424
02:28:58,740 --> 02:29:00,140
Well My,
another thing to remind you,

3425
02:29:00,141 --> 02:29:01,490
you don't even think about it as a
journey.

3426
02:29:01,490 --> 02:29:04,730
Just be in the moment except the moment
and be in the moment.

3427
02:29:04,731 --> 02:29:07,220
Live in the moment thinking about the
future plan for the future,

3428
02:29:07,221 --> 02:29:08,930
but exist in the moment.
You know,

3429
02:29:08,931 --> 02:29:10,940
don't think of it as a journey or a
destination,

3430
02:29:10,941 --> 02:29:13,940
but the people that are the most fucked
or the people that are trying to make it

3431
02:29:14,370 --> 02:29:16,300
one day I'm going to make it.
And then when you make,

3432
02:29:16,340 --> 02:29:17,930
there's no making.
It never happens.

3433
02:29:17,970 --> 02:29:18,950
It doesn't,
it doesn't change.

3434
02:29:19,630 --> 02:29:21,980
It doesn't matter if you're an illusion.
I fell for it.

3435
02:29:21,981 --> 02:29:23,570
Hook,
line and sinker.

3436
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:26,810
Oh my God.
The the wanting to be a rock star my

3437
02:29:26,811 --> 02:29:28,670
whole life.
They got me good.

3438
02:29:29,030 --> 02:29:30,650
I wanted that man shit.
Oh,

3439
02:29:30,651 --> 02:29:35,651
I was going to have that mansion and
just filled with the shakes and that's

3440
02:29:35,780 --> 02:29:39,380
what I was after my whole life.
They got me good.

3441
02:29:39,381 --> 02:29:41,660
When I saw kiss and I saw that shit,
I'm like,

3442
02:29:41,870 --> 02:29:43,400
I want that.

3443
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:44,241
I knew,
right,

3444
02:29:44,241 --> 02:29:45,650
right.
When I saw kiss meets the phantom of the

3445
02:29:45,651 --> 02:29:48,230
park,
1978 on NBC,

3446
02:29:48,290 --> 02:29:53,290
one of the worst movies of all time.
It just blew me the fuck.

3447
02:29:53,350 --> 02:29:55,160
Oh,
he was a power outage.

3448
02:29:56,680 --> 02:29:59,090
I was watching it at home and the power
went out and I was devastated.

3449
02:29:59,150 --> 02:30:03,350
The weird thing about that,
that Arrow's 1978 and if you followed

3450
02:30:03,351 --> 02:30:04,450
kiss,
if you were older,

3451
02:30:04,460 --> 02:30:07,610
I was eight and if you followed kiss and
you know from 73 on,

3452
02:30:07,850 --> 02:30:12,850
they already had their early cool years
and then after kiss alive that a few

3453
02:30:13,521 --> 02:30:17,180
more awesome albums and then they got to
the point where I started doing disco

3454
02:30:17,360 --> 02:30:21,320
and that was 1978 that's when I got into
them when they started doing disco.

3455
02:30:21,321 --> 02:30:23,330
So I didn't,
I didn't even know what selling out was.

3456
02:30:23,331 --> 02:30:25,430
I just heard I was made for loving it
and I loved it.

3457
02:30:25,700 --> 02:30:26,930
You know what I mean?
I had no idea.

3458
02:30:27,260 --> 02:30:29,510
But um,
man,

3459
02:30:29,511 --> 02:30:30,950
I don't even know where my fucking point
was.

3460
02:30:30,951 --> 02:30:32,960
What were we talking about?
I don't remember either.

3461
02:30:32,961 --> 02:30:36,050
The point was you're never going to get
to know what the future holds.

3462
02:30:36,490 --> 02:30:39,470
You just going to be living your life
and that's how it is with everybody.

3463
02:30:40,430 --> 02:30:41,870
I don't remember what the fuck your
point was.

3464
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:45,350
Swallow the rockstar thing Roxanne to be
a rock star.

3465
02:30:45,950 --> 02:30:47,210
They get you.
They get,

3466
02:30:47,211 --> 02:30:49,580
you can,
there's so many different ways they can,

3467
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:52,130
like,
you get your,

3468
02:30:52,430 --> 02:30:53,660
you get yourself too.
I mean,

3469
02:30:53,661 --> 02:30:54,820
you gotta,
you gotta think about what you're

3470
02:30:54,830 --> 02:30:55,740
exposed to,
but look,

3471
02:30:55,741 --> 02:30:56,840
it's like,
like music videos,

3472
02:30:56,841 --> 02:30:58,760
what they sell in music videos.
They sell that.

3473
02:30:58,761 --> 02:31:01,970
It's like they're offering it.
The book I got and a lot of those

3474
02:31:01,971 --> 02:31:04,190
rappers that are flashing on the cash,
it's not even their money.

3475
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:05,720
It's not even there,
their mansion.

3476
02:31:05,990 --> 02:31:10,990
But it's pushing that you like pushing,
like you want to do whatever it takes,

3477
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:15,380
whatever it takes to make it.
I was so zeroed in on that,

3478
02:31:15,381 --> 02:31:16,030
you know me?
Yep.

3479
02:31:16,030 --> 02:31:20,010
Up until up until a few years ago,
I was zeroed in on it.

3480
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:22,080
Uh,
then I began to realize,

3481
02:31:22,081 --> 02:31:23,250
wow,
they got me real.

3482
02:31:23,251 --> 02:31:25,110
God damn good.
You know,

3483
02:31:25,111 --> 02:31:27,060
I was obsessed with some,
some,

3484
02:31:27,270 --> 02:31:28,380
uh,
an illusion.

3485
02:31:28,410 --> 02:31:31,650
Fame is an illusion.
Obsessed with the destination instead of

3486
02:31:31,651 --> 02:31:32,640
the journey.
Right.

3487
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:34,260
Well,
I enjoyed the journey,

3488
02:31:34,261 --> 02:31:38,610
but it was like you're obsessed with,
it was all about conquering the music

3489
02:31:38,611 --> 02:31:40,080
business.
That's all it was about.

3490
02:31:40,380 --> 02:31:42,120
And it's not about that anymore,
obviously.

3491
02:31:42,121 --> 02:31:45,630
Thank God,
thank God I sucked musically because if

3492
02:31:45,631 --> 02:31:48,570
I would've had a record deal and my 20s
shit,

3493
02:31:48,571 --> 02:31:50,700
I have did some crazy illuminati shit
back then,

3494
02:31:50,701 --> 02:31:52,590
I would did whatever I like,
whatever.

3495
02:31:52,590 --> 02:31:56,250
Just I would have been to those parties
with the crazy mask and been doing.

3496
02:31:57,510 --> 02:31:59,310
I'm like,
let's go have parties with the crazy

3497
02:31:59,720 --> 02:32:00,840
shot.
They just let you think.

3498
02:32:00,980 --> 02:32:02,820
Guidewire hit album.
They're like,

3499
02:32:02,821 --> 02:32:03,654
hey,
Eddie Brown,

3500
02:32:05,510 --> 02:32:07,270
come off California.
Come on down.

3501
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:10,680
Thank God my music sucked because I
would have went along with all that shit

3502
02:32:10,681 --> 02:32:14,580
in my twenties I was so obsessed.
I was so obsessed with making it in the

3503
02:32:14,581 --> 02:32:15,960
music business.
I would have did any of the home,

3504
02:32:15,961 --> 02:32:20,070
but you wouldn't have done that.
Gone part of the Jimmy Savile.

3505
02:32:20,680 --> 02:32:23,460
I would have been hanging out with
whoever was famous,

3506
02:32:23,490 --> 02:32:25,700
you know shares.
Well,

3507
02:32:25,710 --> 02:32:28,770
you know it's like retirement is a
lesser example that people are always

3508
02:32:28,771 --> 02:32:32,790
looking to those golden years.
One day I'm going to retire and I with

3509
02:32:32,791 --> 02:32:34,530
our hands at the sunset like,
no,

3510
02:32:34,540 --> 02:32:38,370
you're thinking about death then we
don't do shit anymore.

3511
02:32:38,470 --> 02:32:39,960
You don't have nothing to do.
You know?

3512
02:32:39,961 --> 02:32:42,660
The only time you should think about
retirement is if you have a job that you

3513
02:32:42,661 --> 02:32:46,110
can retire and they pay you still and
then you can go do whatever the fuck you

3514
02:32:46,111 --> 02:32:47,430
want.
That's what you should be thinking about

3515
02:32:47,431 --> 02:32:49,740
retiring.
But thinking about is this time where

3516
02:32:50,050 --> 02:32:51,450
heindel leave,
we get to relax,

3517
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:54,870
she put our feet up and then they turn
you into soylent green,

3518
02:32:55,530 --> 02:32:58,170
turn you in a foot.
That's what you were really green aiming

3519
02:32:58,171 --> 02:32:59,420
for and it,
you know,

3520
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:04,520
and everyone is is a working t to get
that vacation and some far away beach

3521
02:33:05,431 --> 02:33:09,540
where they can have a beer and the
destination is that they go far away at

3522
02:33:09,541 --> 02:33:12,170
least five to eight hours.
You gotta you gotta you can't just use,

3523
02:33:12,300 --> 02:33:14,910
you can't just use that to get just,
you have here these beaches don't count

3524
02:33:14,970 --> 02:33:15,130
it.

3525
02:33:15,130 --> 02:33:17,190
They count for people and not on the
east coast.

3526
02:33:17,370 --> 02:33:19,830
They count cause they come here but you
live here so it doesn't count.

3527
02:33:19,831 --> 02:33:21,510
You got to get on a flight and get on
it.

3528
02:33:21,511 --> 02:33:24,270
Go to a Goddamn beach.
It looks just like Malibu.

3529
02:33:24,510 --> 02:33:27,120
Just like you got to trap you.
Got to go across the country go,

3530
02:33:27,121 --> 02:33:31,410
you've got to go to Fiji,
the Ocean Masco chasing that beach,

3531
02:33:31,500 --> 02:33:32,670
and then what are you gonna do on that
beach?

3532
02:33:32,730 --> 02:33:34,890
The first thing you're going to do is
check to see if there's internet as the

3533
02:33:34,891 --> 02:33:39,891
first hacking thing you're going to do.
It's an illusion and then every time you

3534
02:33:40,501 --> 02:33:44,430
go to the airport you see that picture
of like some dude just lay in there on

3535
02:33:44,431 --> 02:33:47,280
some deserted beach.
Like that's even possible.

3536
02:33:47,310 --> 02:33:50,970
I thought that was possible.
I thought it might've deserted like a

3537
02:33:51,150 --> 02:33:53,100
deserted that you have your own deserted
beach,

3538
02:33:53,310 --> 02:33:57,120
you know that your genome,
see that I off camera,

3539
02:33:57,270 --> 02:34:00,480
out of the frame of the picture is a
bunch of people trying to sell you a,

3540
02:34:00,630 --> 02:34:02,580
an inner tube and some just,
you know,

3541
02:34:02,581 --> 02:34:04,530
people trying to rip you off and sell
you shit.

3542
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:06,810
They don't show that part.
They just show your feet,

3543
02:34:07,210 --> 02:34:09,510
your feet in a beer.
If you have a perfect beach like that,

3544
02:34:09,511 --> 02:34:10,890
you're going to sell it to a bunch of
people.

3545
02:34:11,190 --> 02:34:14,130
And it's not just to be this one dude.
Unless you one of those Richard Branson

3546
02:34:14,131 --> 02:34:15,900
guys,
that's when you go full or you got your

3547
02:34:15,901 --> 02:34:17,890
own beach Wa yes,
yes.

3548
02:34:17,891 --> 02:34:19,050
You have that.
Those,

3549
02:34:19,060 --> 02:34:21,340
those only exist for Jay z.
You know what I mean?

3550
02:34:21,341 --> 02:34:24,670
You've got to buy an island.
Richard Branson type dudes or Tyler

3551
02:34:24,670 --> 02:34:26,740
Perry.
He's got an island and it just seems

3552
02:34:26,741 --> 02:34:28,900
like these vacations are all like rip
offs.

3553
02:34:28,901 --> 02:34:33,580
I remember me and my wife went to Cabo
San Lucas and we looked at the package

3554
02:34:33,581 --> 02:34:34,570
and like,
Oh shit,

3555
02:34:34,690 --> 02:34:38,050
let's get this resort.
There's five different restaurants.

3556
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:39,790
Amazing.
All inclusive.

3557
02:34:40,030 --> 02:34:43,720
This is amazing.
You get there and it's the same kitchen,

3558
02:34:43,990 --> 02:34:46,780
five different restaurants,
but only one is open at a time.

3559
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:49,270
They just take different shifts and it's
the same waiters,

3560
02:34:49,390 --> 02:34:50,660
the same food.
Oh,

3561
02:34:50,680 --> 02:34:54,560
you to come up bunk ass place.
I've got to send you to some good

3562
02:34:54,590 --> 02:34:57,340
places.
There's a good place in uh,

3563
02:34:57,360 --> 02:35:00,250
in Cabo.
It's called the one and only [inaudible]

3564
02:35:00,320 --> 02:35:03,190
never go back there again.
Cabo was amazing.

3565
02:35:03,730 --> 02:35:05,230
I love it.
Oh Man.

3566
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:08,370
Everyone's trying to rip you off growing
up.

3567
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:10,060
Yeah,
that happens.

3568
02:35:10,061 --> 02:35:11,650
What about Hawaii?
Hawaii.

3569
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:13,310
Yeah.
If someone goes on vacation,

3570
02:35:13,560 --> 02:35:17,980
someone gave me a nonstop first class
ticket to Hawaii and a five star hotel

3571
02:35:17,981 --> 02:35:19,240
for two weeks,
I wouldn't go.

3572
02:35:20,460 --> 02:35:22,870
Why not?
I've traveled so much.

3573
02:35:22,871 --> 02:35:26,160
It's an illusion to me.
I want to use up all my shit much.

3574
02:35:26,890 --> 02:35:29,410
I want to sit in my house and look out
the window and she'll fuck.

3575
02:35:29,411 --> 02:35:30,250
Yeah.
You know,

3576
02:35:30,790 --> 02:35:33,400
that's what I want to chill.
I want to be with my family.

3577
02:35:33,401 --> 02:35:34,330
I want to be with my son.

3578
02:35:34,660 --> 02:35:35,830
That's an illusion.
They have,

3579
02:35:35,890 --> 02:35:37,750
you know,
I'm going to travel with my family for

3580
02:35:37,751 --> 02:35:39,580
them,
but I've traveled so much.

3581
02:35:39,640 --> 02:35:42,610
To me it's an illusion.
I've never been to a place where,

3582
02:35:42,740 --> 02:35:44,620
um,
I was pissed that I was leaving.

3583
02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:46,330
I was always ready to go.
Like,

3584
02:35:46,331 --> 02:35:46,930
dude,
I'm ready.

3585
02:35:46,930 --> 02:35:48,790
You want to change our flights and leave
early?

3586
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:49,960
Shit,
when we went to Cabo,

3587
02:35:49,961 --> 02:35:51,670
we change our flights and left early.
It sucked.

3588
02:35:51,990 --> 02:35:53,530
Wow.
Like what are you gonna sit on a beach?

3589
02:35:53,810 --> 02:35:55,870
We got that right here.
We go to Santa Monica.

3590
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:58,170
He had a free vacation we've made.
We got,

3591
02:35:58,630 --> 02:36:01,300
me and my family get hotels because my
son loves hotels.

3592
02:36:01,420 --> 02:36:04,720
We'll just get a hotel in Burbank,
like a VIP hotel in Burbank where you've

3593
02:36:04,721 --> 02:36:07,900
got like this gigantic room and we
stayed there for for a day.

3594
02:36:07,930 --> 02:36:10,510
You got to just do w we'll talk after
the podcast.

3595
02:36:10,550 --> 02:36:13,990
You can do vacations the right way.
There's ways that you could do go zip

3596
02:36:13,991 --> 02:36:15,910
lining in Costa Rica.
Dude,

3597
02:36:15,911 --> 02:36:17,870
I got tricked into going to Costa Rica.
I told you that.

3598
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:20,580
I'll never go to Costa Rica ever again.
Okay,

3599
02:36:20,581 --> 02:36:22,390
that's good.
Unless it's for a seminar.

3600
02:36:22,391 --> 02:36:24,130
I'll go for a seminar.
Like could you just to seminar,

3601
02:36:24,131 --> 02:36:26,890
but I ain't trying to go to the jungle
and anything like that.

3602
02:36:27,490 --> 02:36:29,470
Fuck that shit.
We've got to wrap this up because I'm

3603
02:36:29,471 --> 02:36:31,630
going to Piss my pants.
I've been drinking too much wine.

3604
02:36:31,631 --> 02:36:32,540
I throw a plug.
Yes,

3605
02:36:33,160 --> 02:36:38,160
me and Sam Tripoli or doing tin foil hat
comedy in San Francisco at Cobb's June

3606
02:36:40,060 --> 02:36:44,110
1st and June 2nd at the punchline in
Sacramento.

3607
02:36:44,410 --> 02:36:46,720
Uh,
thanks for the shirt.

3608
02:36:47,200 --> 02:36:48,690
Oh Shit.
Combat Complex.

3609
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:53,170
The world's Eddie Bravo's birth child
along with Ebi Ebi on a tangent

3610
02:36:53,470 --> 02:36:55,900
invitational.
Best fucking Jujitsu tournament in the

3611
02:36:55,901 --> 02:36:56,950
world.
But this,

3612
02:36:57,220 --> 02:36:58,990
this is the shit combat Jujitsu.

3613
02:36:58,990 --> 02:37:01,250
We talked about it many time.
This is going to change Jujitsu,

3614
02:37:01,320 --> 02:37:04,450
make it much more applicable to mma
positions on the ground where dudes are

3615
02:37:04,451 --> 02:37:05,440
allowed to bitch.
Slap you.

3616
02:37:05,620 --> 02:37:07,000
It's strong.
It's crazy.

3617
02:37:07,001 --> 02:37:08,710
People love it.
It was the,

3618
02:37:08,950 --> 02:37:12,160
it's the fastest Ryan.
He's rising video ever on my youtube

3619
02:37:12,161 --> 02:37:14,880
channel.
It got to 300,000 views and like in a

3620
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:17,360
level,
none of my other videos get that kind of

3621
02:37:17,361 --> 02:37:18,171
views.
It was crazy.

3622
02:37:18,171 --> 02:37:19,700
It's next level.
It shows what,

3623
02:37:19,701 --> 02:37:21,530
like these positions where the
vulnerabilities are.

3624
02:37:21,860 --> 02:37:26,860
So it's like a real good first step in
MMA is fighting vagner road shop for the

3625
02:37:26,931 --> 02:37:29,730
combat Jujitsu world championships.
Ebi,

Jujitsu World Championship boogie

3629
02:37:41,030 --> 02:37:43,640

3630
02:37:43,670 --> 02:37:46,030

She's the best checkout there.

3633
02:37:52,490 --> 02:37:56,330
Be a mosquito.
