1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,790
Four,
three,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,710
two,
one.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,030
Ryan sickler brought some Baltimore work
ethic.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,660
I can't believe you got actual piece of
paper that you brought.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,250
Yeah,
I a Kamaka you.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,490
What are you prepared?
I'm prepared.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,000
Unprepared.
Unprepared.

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,400
This is just shit to come back to that.
Baltimore accent is.

9
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:22,260
So when you.
I have two very good friends.

10
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:24,660
My good friend John Rollo and my good
friend.

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,280
Excuse me.
Benno Brian.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,730
Both from Baltimore and both got the
like if you don't know.

13
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,880
Yeah,
that's a weird accident.

14
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:34,080
It's like,
what is that?

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,290
Hey Joe.
Hey Joe Rogan.

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,380
I love your podcast.
Jail.

17
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,970
It's a weird accent.
It's so fucking weird.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,180
It's and people,
they're like hardcore.

19
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:48,160
They say shit like for sync.
They'll say zinc kitchen.

20
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,240
Zinc,
ambulance.

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,840
Think I um,
I didn't realize I had a southern accent

22
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,150
until I moved here.
And I still don't believe I have a

23
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:58,770
southern accent.
I'll give it a draw.

24
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,750
I'll give it a draw is a southern
accent.

25
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:04,680
But overall it's a different one.
It's not Alabama,

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,570
Mississippi,
south.

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,810
It's a friendly southern accent.
Like it's not,

28
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,771
it's not like,
man,

29
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,440
I can't talk to this motherfucker.
Right.

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,440
But it's like,
oh,

31
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:15,030
where are you from?
He's one of those.

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,340
People are always surprised when I say
Maryland.

33
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,190
But when you get into pockets of like a
Virginia,

34
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:23,130
they've got a southern accent there.
Even when you go into like Indiana,

35
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,490
there are certain areas of Indiana that
have a southern accent and other places

36
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,860
that don't like.
It's really weird about these little

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,550
settlements and they've just developed
these accents that just stay there.

38
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,190
I think Baltimore is one of the most
misunderstood though.

39
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,400
That's a weird one because it's a big
city.

40
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,940
I mean Baltimore is a big city.
They call it the big little city.

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,280
How many people in Baltimore?

42
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,990
If I had a guest,
couple million,

43
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,030
I'd say that's fair.
Yeah.

44
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,040
That's a big city.
Bigger than San Diego.

45
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes.
Yeah.

46
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,100
But it's gotten older.
He's got history.

47
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:55,140
You know,
that's a lot of history.

48
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,100
But that weird ass accent that if you
don't know anybody from Baltimore,

49
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:02,310
you don't know that accent.
I had my buddy owns a junk yard in the

50
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:04,980
city and uh,
I took Jay back when we were on tour as

51
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,220
you've got to come meet him.
See this junk yard and shit and you

52
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:09,060
know,
people drop.

53
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:09,571
He's like,
oh,

54
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:10,980
we're doing everything.
And he's like,

55
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,160
just put a k on the end of that right
there.

56
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,530
Everything.
Yeah.

57
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,600
You guys don't know any pick you're
doing over there.

58
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,030
And he's also for for years I said
Washington DC,

59
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,930
Washer and dryer because everyone there
it says it right?

60
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,520
And one day somebody said,
wait,

61
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:30,360
what'd you say?
I said,

62
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,580
put it in the Washer and they're like,
spell washer,

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,030
w a s h e r like there's no r in that.
And I was like,

64
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,450
Huh?
And I started saying to myself,

65
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:38,310
I'm like,
oh my God,

66
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,470
I do fucking say Washington and Washer.
So I trained myself to get out of that.

67
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:45,780
But anytime I see something political on
tv,

68
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:48,510
if I hear someone say,
we're in Washington,

69
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,201
then I'm like,
ah,

70
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,730
you're in that.
You're from that area.

71
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,270
The same way with the days of the week.
I was telling you Monday,

72
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,290
Tuesday we do our podcast crab feast
comes out every Tuesday and I listened

73
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,890
to announcers like Phil Sims.

74
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,590
He's like,
well they were working out on Monday and

75
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:02,981
I'm like,
yeah,

76
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:05,980
you're from that area.
That's how I pick up little shit like

77
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:07,140
that.
Yeah.

78
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:09,910
Well I grew up in Boston.
That's an obvious accent.

79
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:12,550
Everybody knows that accent,
but you don't have it.

80
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:13,660
I got rid of it.
Oh,

81
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:18,661
so you did have shook it loose,
but if you hear me from like tooth that

82
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,590
early before pre 2000 I had it,
you know,

83
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:24,161
I just,
I,

84
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,110
I heard it too much.
I heard it in my own.

85
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,660
I was like iu and then they got rid of
it.

86
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,930
First Time I heard I was 19,
I did this thing and I was on local

87
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:34,840
television at 19 and I heard my voice,
my accent.

88
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,300
I was like,
what in the fuck is that sound coming

89
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,730
out of my mouth?
I got to correct that.

90
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,280
Do you ever slip into it from the
hammered?

91
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,340
If I'm hammered and I'm around Boston
people,

92
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,890
it'll come out a little bit,
but just to touch,

93
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,290
just to touch.
Otherwise it would be fake.

94
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,160
Mine comes out more like I'll go home
for a week in the summer.

95
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:56,830
I just,
by midweek I'm just talking way.

96
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,480
Oh yeah.
I'm home.

97
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm home on the.
That's another one.

98
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,960
Dropping an end on the end of.
Now we're going to come over right now.

99
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,530
Now you swallow your ells.
You say,

100
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,090
uh,
get a salad and a belly.

101
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,650
Belly.
What do you want to have?

102
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,620
He's going to have a salad too.
He's out in the alley right now.

103
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,750
Like there's no l,
there's no l.

104
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,500
How it is that there's no LP.
Some people I say Baltimore with a D.

105
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,350
I put a touch of a d on it.
Bald Baltimore,

106
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,660
Baltimore Versus Baltimore.
Baltimore.

107
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,470
But Baltimore Bet your friends probably
say bomber.

108
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,980
That's how like a hardcore,
like when you ask,

109
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,031
you know,
out here,

110
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:37,810
you can ask anyone.

111
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,790
Where are you from when you ask somebody
back there to like,

112
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,640
they don't even say like another area of
Maryland.

113
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,010
Just go here.
You know I haven't left here.

114
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:46,630
This fucking block right here.
Like,

115
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:49,200
what are you talking about?
This is where I've run this fucking.

116
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,160
Yeah man.
There's something about me that end.

117
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,430
These people that are just like super
locals.

118
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,480
They just say,
fuck,

119
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:57,790
it doesn't miss bought.
That's another great name.

120
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,320
Super locals.
Yeah.

121
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,780
That's the truth.
This people that are like that,

122
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:02,950
right?
They just like,

123
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:05,740
this is where I fucked in my bar.
Like Denver,

124
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:08,710
Colorado.
Everyplace else can go fuck off.

125
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,040
People like them and it's like there's
something to that,

126
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:12,491
right?
You,

127
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:15,190
you know that spot and you're like,
I get it.

128
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,630
I get the rest of the country.
Good.

129
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:18,130
Good luck.
Good luck with all that.

130
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,210
You know.
If you didn't live here chasing those

131
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:24,010
Hollywood dreams,
what would you be?

132
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,940
In a perfect world,
I'd probably have a house right on the

133
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:31,730
white river in Maryland.
A salt water.

134
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,020
I'd have four wheelers.
I'd throw some traps out in the water on

135
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,050
Monday.
Oh,

136
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:41,350
crab traps and buy now.
Here's the.

137
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,440
This is how you say the day Saturday,
and by Saturday,

138
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,980
Saturday,
by Saturday we'll have a fucking crab

139
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,370
feast on God damn right.
Hence the podcasts,

140
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,350
and every week I would have my own.
I'll just throw them out there because

141
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:56,950
I.
that's one thing I really miss about

142
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,130
merit.
Like the Sushi out here

143
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,160
is phenomenal,
but the seafood,

144
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,840
there's different.
We could go,

145
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,090
we could go to a dive bar right now and
have a plate,

146
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,480
a bucket of rocks,
like little pony rolling rocks and a

147
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:12,140
plate of Mussels,
Marinara that will blow any fucking

148
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,810
restaurant out here out in a,
in a dive blues bar.

149
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,010
I miss the readiness of an availability
of delicious seafood

150
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,430
everywhere I go.
That's interesting.

151
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:23,740
Yeah.
There's not a lot of really good seafood

152
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:25,480
restaurants.
There's just Sushi out here.

153
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,160
Yeah,
that's a real good point.

154
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,260
It's like what do you get out here for
seafood?

155
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:33,520
Like some will have salmon on the menu
or maybe this like haddock or something

156
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:35,750
like that.
Or halibut or you don't know.

157
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,770
There's not like.
Like back home in Boston it was legal.

158
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,790
Seafoods was a joint 100 percent.
I mean people went to a seafood

159
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:43,624
restaurant.
Yep.

160
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,820
Seafood restaurants.
Not Popular out here.

161
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,500
No.
Why is that?

162
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:51,180
And we're on the water and then we're a
coastal fucking like,

163
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,030
why aren't we embrace if there's an
ocean right there embracing that.

164
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,810
Not only that,
you go to that ocean,

165
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:58,360
it's hardly anybody fishing.
Yup.

166
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,610
That's a weird one.
Like California,

167
00:07:00,611 --> 00:07:01,444
like go,
go to the,

168
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,920
like all up by Santa Monica.
Malibu.

169
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,380
Hardly anybody fishing.
You might see one or two.

170
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,830
I just looked up best bass fishing out
here in California because my brother

171
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:18,730
just bought a place in Delaware on the
water is brackish,

172
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:21,190
but it's not enough to keep crabs.
Uh,

173
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,470
but he's pulling out large mouth and
sending me pictures.

174
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:25,390
I'm like,
good for you and go fuck yourself.

175
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,260
And he just,
I mean nice big fat ones out here.

176
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:30,970
They grow them big.
They do a,

177
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:33,940
they say mistakes.
Good because I got to get up there and

178
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:37,650
go again.
But pyramid they said I feel like

179
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,660
I feel like pyramid dried up a little
bit.

180
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,421
No,
no,

181
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:41,740
you can drive by it.
You can.

182
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,810
Yeah.
I drive by on the way up to,

183
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,670
to hone ranch.
It's a beautiful lake.

184
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:48,310
Pyramid is like one of them lost lakes
people don't know about,

185
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,040
but yeah,
I would live there on the water and uh,

186
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,900
I mean I miss my dad was an outdoors.
I was talking to you about this at the

187
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:00,270
comedy store.
My Dad hunted and stuff but fished,

188
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,100
but uh,
he really got us into crab and,

189
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:03,690
and not just throwing traps in the
water.

190
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,880
We used to,
we had a trotline we used to run a

191
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:08,370
trotline.
So this is,

192
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:10,740
if I could,
my father died when I was 16.

193
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,170
I've always thought about this.
If I had 24 hours,

194
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,770
if my dad could come back here right now
for 24 hours,

195
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:20,050
what would I do?
And we be up on the water crabbing at

196
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,690
5:00 AM.
Sun Up.

197
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,310
That's right when you're allowed to
start dipping.

198
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,360
And then home by 11 and then steam them
up,

199
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,870
have a big ass fucking crab feast and
Probably Watch a game.

200
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:31,291
I'll be like,
hey,

201
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,770
these are the ravens
here when you die.

202
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,450
And then play catch into the night.
That would be what I would do.

203
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,910
But we had um,
so he,

204
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,150
he had a friend that lived on the
eastern shore that was a crab,

205
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,520
a got crab or man,
I guess.

206
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,810
But uh,
he taught us how to do a homemade one.

207
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:51,900
So we had this,
he went and bought this jon boat,

208
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:54,360
this old Wood Jon boat,
Jon Boat,

209
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,220
Jon boat,
a bottom boat versus

210
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,870
the v bottom.
And it was wood.

211
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,040
I'm not aluminum.
This one was a white painted up just a

212
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:02,874
beater,
you know.

213
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,900
And uh,
we had uh,

214
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,190
uh,
Johnson Motor.

215
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,900
Yeah.
Every time I hear that Alan Jackson Song

216
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:13,620
drive,
he's talks about a 75 johns and with an

217
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,580
electric choke,
I'm like,

218
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,200
oh,
take me back.

219
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,710
So it was our boat that was our little
rig.

220
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:24,711
It's me and my two brothers and my dad.
And what you do to do a homemade,

221
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,050
when you take a bucket five gallon
bucket a,

222
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:30,930
or even just a smaller one,
just some quick Crete with an eye hook

223
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:31,764
in it.
Okay.

224
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,100
Tie your rope here to some chain,
other side of the chain,

225
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:40,740
another rope up to a clorox bottles.
That's your float on this side.

226
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,630
Okay.
Chain,

227
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,590
50 yards of rope chain,
50 yards.

228
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,200
Same setup.
I just told you on the other end.

229
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,970
So the Clark's bottles,
just so you know where you are.

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,770
That's right.
That's your beginning and your end.

231
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,120
And then every three feet,
and this dude was sell ahead of his time

232
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:59,850
like this.
We're talking about mid eighties,

233
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,040
late mid to late eighties were doing
this.

234
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,440
He's like,
go to the butcher and get bullets.

235
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,020
You know the.
Yeah,

236
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,060
the discarded lips of bowls,
actual bullets.

237
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,300
And that's going to be your bait because
crabs are the biggest scavengers you

238
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:14,520
could use.
Chicken necks are popular.

239
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:16,170
That's an easy one.
You just go to the grocery store,

240
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:18,720
but you've got to go to a fucking
butcher to get bullets.

241
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:20,780
I don't know.
Everybody's got those grocery stores.

242
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,440
Is it more effective?
It's just stank and nasty and like using

243
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,590
chicken liver for catfish.
Exactly.

244
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:31,050
But also it's durable because these
things are eating it.

245
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,750
That's going to be your line for most of
the summer.

246
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,640
You know,
you might have to replace one or two,

247
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:40,110
but that's adorable bait that can
withstand the crabs.

248
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:44,100
Tearing it up for three months.
So really three months.

249
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,720
Well,
if you're going out over the summer,

250
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:47,790
I'm saying,
let's say you go crabbing 10 times

251
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,470
during the summer,
you could probably get away with that

252
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,870
whole trotline,
maybe replace one or two that might slip

253
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:54,270
out because you freeze it.
So.

254
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,520
Alright.
So the reason the lips.

255
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,860
Yeah.
Well that you tie him every three feet.

256
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,420
Right?
And then that's your trotline big as a

257
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,490
bullet about that big and buff fat a
couple inches.

258
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,600
Well they caught him.
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:07,381
That's not A.
Yeah,

260
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:10,260
they'll slice them.
So they look like almost like fat eels,

261
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,730
you know,
little tiny or leeches.

262
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,450
Let me say leeches leeches.
So then you get out,

263
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,510
you're allowed sun up.
You're only allowed two bushel without a

264
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,280
permit.

265
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,060
A license.
So we're out there.

266
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,010
[inaudible] yeah.
Two Bushels.

267
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,310
Let's two Bushel liquid.
Is that two Bushel baskets like apple

268
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,190
baskets?
Probably.

269
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,470
But you're getting.
That's the thing is you buy them,

270
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,310
you'll get maybe seven,
eight doesn't.

271
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,620
But if you're going out,
you're throwing shit away.

272
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:36,970
You'd pay good money for it to store
because you're getting,

273
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,730
you're getting the best big suckers.
There is nothing better than pulling it

274
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,490
right out of the water and taking it
home and eating it,

275
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,430
not getting it from the store,
not been.

276
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,530
You know who,
who knows how they stored it and there's

277
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:51,480
dudes on the side of the road that when
they have more,

278
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,950
they'll just pour over in their pickup
truck,

279
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,640
put a fucking cardboard,
sign down,

280
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:56,650
20 bucks a Bushel,
and you just get them and go,

281
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,370
that's something I miss.
You make me hungry.

282
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:03,900
I'm doing.
These are what kind of blue crabs.

283
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,930
Crabs.
That's right.

284
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,050
So you get out,
you put a little two by four across your

285
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:10,480
or holes.
Drop your bolts in there.

286
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,810
That's your wood.
At the end you have an empty spool of

287
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:14,980
rope.
Okay?

288
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:17,740
Mt One,
and you just stealth everything.

289
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:19,870
We were talking about those slow riding
Harley's.

290
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:23,680
You Stealth Roger Boat and you got to be
steady.

291
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,260
Someone reaches over and they pull the
rope up,

292
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,900
put it on the Spool,
and then your natural progression

293
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:33,670
forward slowly brings the line up and
then set it back down the water and you

294
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:37,180
got to go slow because those you're
pulling those crabs up from the bottom

295
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:41,480
and they'll stay on the whole time and
then you're just fucking dip and dumping

296
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,690
dip and endo.
It's.

297
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,180
And then the title come in.
You hop out of the boat,

298
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:48,190
swim around a little bit.
You get the soft crabs,

299
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:51,610
the ones that are coming closer to shore
to molt their shelves so they can get

300
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:54,360
bigger and then those you take and we'd
get about a six,

301
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,040
eight of those.
Take those home crab.

302
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,630
You're having a time.
Your fucking lights off.

303
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,120
Show crabs are fantastic.
It's so good.

304
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,800
Those are so good with lemon and butter.
God the bus.

305
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,230
I love it.
That's.

306
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,840
That's what I would do.
That's exactly where I'd be.

307
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,470
Dude.
I ran into John Reape last night that,

308
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,640
you know,
rape is a,

309
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,710
he's a,
he's a road warrior,

310
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,930
you know,
constantly on the road and we were

311
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:19,770
talking last night.
He's like,

312
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:22,590
I'm not sure why I'm still in La.
He goes,

313
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:24,120
I don't have to live here.
He's like,

314
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,760
I'm here all the time.
I'm doing sets and everything like that.

315
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,890
He goes,
but I'm on the road man,

316
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,240
and I go,
where are you going to move to?

317
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:31,074
And he goes,
dude,

318
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,750
I'm going to get a fucking house on the
lake in North Carolina.

319
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,550
Oh,
I've done this and I keep talking.

320
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,620
You tell me more.
What's it look like?

321
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,430
Look like delay clears the walk,
you know,

322
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,220
that sounds perfect to me.
I got a buddy who's got a place in

323
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,770
quarter lane and uh,
they sent pictures and eat.

324
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,480
Dude,
you could be in like 60 feet of water

325
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,380
and you take a picture and you see every
pebble on the bottom of the water.

326
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:06,120
I mean it was just crystal clear.
It's like a big old bottle of Fiji.

327
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:10,800
You just see everything on the bottom.
Big Old northern pike swimming around in

328
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:13,320
there.
Yeah.

329
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,730
Idaho.

330
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,140
They fishing crab and yeah,
I've been to quarterly and I know

331
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,490
driving to Montana from Seattle,

332
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,410
come through there.
I'd Never Been Idaho.

333
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:25,020
I'm going for the first time.
I'm in Boise this month.

334
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,310
Right?
Right.

335
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,470
Soon.
Someone's sometime soon.

336
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,720
I love that.
I love,

337
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:31,360
I just love country.
I mean we were,

338
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,340
I was born in the city but we only lived
there until my parents had my younger

339
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:38,860
brother almost when we were four.
We got outta there.

340
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,850
I'm bigger house,
more land and stuff like that.

341
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:44,080
So you know,
you live in a row home,

342
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:46,810
there's no,
I mean our backyard was the size of this

343
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,040
tape,
you know what I mean?

344
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,040
Um,
so I grew up out in the county 20 miles

345
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,200
or so outside the city and my dad was
like,

346
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:56,000
look,
I want you to get a good school

347
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:58,430
education.
But all of my family was in Baltimore.

348
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,010
User gets where you're going to go get
your street education.

349
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:04,370
I'm so glad because I see shit from a
mile away,

350
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,560
a mile away.
Larson's always like,

351
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:08,290
I don't even know how you do it.
We were a,

352
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,050
we were at Denver,
we were in Denver at the end of 2016.

353
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,920
We were doing our tour and we like to
walk home from the shows at night.

354
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:17,530
We'll smoke a little joint,
take a walk,

355
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,890
enjoy your city,
whatever.

356
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,101
And he's like,
oh,

357
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:21,140
there's nothing wrong with them around
like,

358
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:22,790
Denver's got a cops episode,
Bro,

359
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:23,180
you know,
like,

360
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,280
settle down,
you got to

361
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,480
go wrong.
And um,

362
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,050
we're about to take this walkway
underneath this tunnel on the sketchy

363
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:38,051
fucking like white dude sketched out.
Just start circling us with those dark

364
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:41,810
eyes and his crazy smile and traffic is
hauling ass,

365
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,940
right?
Close bias,

366
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,510
right?
And Jason,

367
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,010
what are we going to do?
And I was like,

368
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,070
we're going to stay over here by this
traffic and if that dude charges,

369
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:51,470
as I'm shoving them right into that
fucking traffic,

370
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:52,940
that's exactly what the fuck we're going
to do.

371
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:55,100
I'll bait them over here.
Just shove them right out there and let

372
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:55,934
those cars.

373
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,870
Because he said good night.
He said,

374
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:01,730
Shit.
He was saying shit like that.

375
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:02,860
And I was like,
oh,

376
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,520
one of those guys.
Yeah.

377
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,720
What do you do if you kill someone like
that to tell anybody?

378
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,820
Like it was just you and Jay?
Well,

379
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:13,340
these days everything's on camera.
What cameras?

380
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,590
There's.
There's eye in the sky,

381
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,090
but if.
Oh yeah,

382
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,480
I would tell you.
Yeah,

383
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,110
will tell that one.
I will because I feel like that's self

384
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:22,270
defense if you're,
if you're.

385
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,820
Even if you're leaning toward me to
wrong when you say they bring it up at

386
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:27,210
your show.
Hey Bro,

387
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,220
people
kill any veterans.

388
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,100
Shove a guy,
kill many veterans.

389
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,460
You know the guys at veterans,
what if he is could be ptsd all fucked

390
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:41,350
up.
And then I started moving.

391
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,520
Careful.
Maybe the guy just needs a hug.

392
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,820
Problem is you never know.
Not when you say shit like that and

393
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:49,610
you're certainly circle.
And he circled us like four times.

394
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:52,490
Just kept circling.
I hadn't thought they asked if he wanted

395
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:53,620
a hug.
I'm gonna.

396
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,960
Try this shit.
Yeah.

397
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,440
When you hear I was stabbed to death on
the sidewalk endeavor.

398
00:16:59,450 --> 00:16:59,811
Just.
No,

399
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:00,890
I tried to hug it out.

400
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:08,300
Yeah.
You ever been outside of Denver?

401
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,060
Like Evergreen?
Ever go up there.

402
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,670
I've been to know.
I haven't been to evergreen up into

403
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,460
Colorado Springs.
Evergreen has,

404
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,950
uh,
the northern pike has a cousin,

405
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,650
the Musky.
It's the evil cousin,

406
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,320
the eat ducks and shit.
Ever see a musket lunch?

407
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,740
No dude,
they eat.

408
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,560
They're prehistoric.
I'm gonna.

409
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,470
Look,
that shit is a giant ass fish.

410
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:33,710
But when I was up there the week I was
up there,

411
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:35,780
someone on facebook or something like
that,

412
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:37,640
I was like,
I was like damn evergreens,

413
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,770
beautiful.
This place is gorgeous and I just was

414
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:43,700
looking up shit on evergreen and I saw
some guy pulled one through the ice that

415
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:47,410
was fat around like a girl's waist cv.
Get this.

416
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,860
Holy Shit.

417
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,060
Big Ass animals could eat a duck.
I caught that one in Wisconsin.

418
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,800
Yeah,
looking at one above it.

419
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,260
Looking at one above it.
Look at the size of that and they look

420
00:17:58,261 --> 00:17:59,760
like tigers.
The stripes.

421
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,670
It's a tiger meets a python.
Meets a fish.

422
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,010
Yeah.
That's an evil fish.

423
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,400
They're fucking prehistoric in their
ruthless man.

424
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,500
I mean are you.
I feel like you'd be fighting that thing

425
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:12,370
like a Marlin for like two hours.
Yeah.

426
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:14,010
You.
Especially if you have light tackle,

427
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,170
do you need to be strapped in a chair
for that thing?

428
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:18,090
No,
but look going to battle.

429
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:18,781
Hold that.
Well,

430
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:19,740
yeah,
you're going to battle.

431
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,420
You're going to battle.
Look a fucker.

432
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,020
Oh,
that's not a,

433
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,580
that's not a mosquito.
That doesn't look like a mosquito.

434
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:27,840
To me that looks like a Gar.
What does that.

435
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,760
So the caption says are a pie.
Oh,

436
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,380
our apartment.

437
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,170
Yeah.
That's that gigantic fish that lives in

438
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,300
Bolivia and Ecuador.
That our apartment is a fish that lives

439
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:41,850
in the Amazon,
I believe somewhere in the rain forest.

440
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,300
And um,
they used to,

441
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,710
the locals used to catch them all the
time.

442
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:51,711
It was like a big thing for their food,
but they're worth so much money for

443
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,100
Americans to go down and fish for them
and now they protect them.

444
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,750
Uh,
my good friend,

445
00:18:57,751 --> 00:19:02,751
Steve Rinella has a podcast called
mediator and he went down and filmed

446
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:05,520
episode.
He also was a TV show and they filmed

447
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:09,570
some episodes of their show in Peru and
in Bolivia.

448
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,670
And um,
those people,

449
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,330
the locals,
they make a whatever money did,

450
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:18,120
they actually do make.
They make a big portion of it.

451
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,060
Some of them do.
I'm helping people fish for these

452
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:21,940
things.
Um,

453
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,630
you know,
like acting as a guide the size of these

454
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,300
things,
look at that prehistoric giant animal

455
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,240
and they survive in water when there's a
drought.

456
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,140
So when the water gets like super low,
they're surviving and water were like,

457
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:37,140
literally,
like the water's up to their half their

458
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:40,620
face and they're waddling around so you
could just walk right up to him and

459
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:42,600
catch him.
Damn.

460
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:44,340
I want to walk up to anything with teeth
like,

461
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,800
well,
they don't have teeth as big as the,

462
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:48,750
uh,
the muskies.

463
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,550
If you go back Jamie,
to those pictures,

464
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,010
let's see.
There's a bunch of them in like water

465
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:55,750
where their upper body's exposed.
Yeah,

466
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,470
the water's so shallow and they're so
enormous.

467
00:19:58,471 --> 00:19:59,580
I mean,
these are huge,

468
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:01,470
huge dinosaur fit.
Yeah.

469
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,780
There's,
you ever seen a Gar?

470
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,430
Do you know what a garlic side pull up
an alligator gar alligator Gar is.

471
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:10,760
Um,
that is a truly priest,

472
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:13,830
oric fish.
Like I don't think it's changed in

473
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:16,600
millions and millions of years.
That's an alligator.

474
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,360
Had never seen nothing in my life.

475
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,900
These things live in Texas.
They live here in the states.

476
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

477
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:30,240
People fish for them and they get
fucking man.

478
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:34,200
Look that that one right there is clear
that as an head of an alligator in the

479
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:36,060
body of a fish,
it's called a what?

480
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,960
An alligator Gar and their body is
armored.

481
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,870
Like there's those scales.
You have to cut through them with wire

482
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:45,600
cutters.
Like if you try to cut through that shit

483
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:47,770
with like a regular,
like a buck knife or something like

484
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:49,600
that.
No offense to book,

485
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,880
you know,
like a Swiss army knife for some shit.

486
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:53,170
It's not good enough,
man.

487
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,790
Look at the size of that one.
That guy is holding in the,

488
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,280
in the water.
Look at that fucking size of that thing.

489
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,740
Pull up giant alligator Gar.
See if you.

490
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,280
Because I think that.
I think they get into the hundreds of

491
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,113
pounds.

492
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,460
I mean,
what are you catching these with?

493
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:11,770
What is Bait for this?
Like it's a good question.

494
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,460
Something big
Jesus Christ,

495
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,870
but they look at the one in the upper
right corner.

496
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,250
Him in the mouth.
Look,

497
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,133
adapt.
Fuck.

498
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,480
If I saw a glimpse of that pop up out
of,

499
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,170
I cut my own line,
I'd say,

500
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:28,090
fuck that.
Fucking look at that thing.

501
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:32,590
It's such a creepy old dinosaur.
I mean at towers over that guy.

502
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,900
It's not even close.
Eight feet,

503
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:37,570
three inches long.
Two hundred and 30 pounds.

504
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,730
And that's a freshwater animal.
Two to 300,

505
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:46,360
27 broken bow lake,
Oklahoma

506
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,620
is so to dolphins stuck together.
Look at a fuck.

507
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,310
And you look at that.
That's an edible cut through this good.

508
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,720
You cut through all that.
They caught that one in Nicaragua.

509
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,900
So I guess they're all everywhere.
But um,

510
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:05,770
yeah,
you take them,

511
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:11,230
you got to cut through that scale,
that scaly outside with wire cutters.

512
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,900
And then once you get through all that
you,

513
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,180
you take the meat and they really liked
smoking it.

514
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,260
They put it on a smoker.
That's apparently the best way to.

515
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,150
This guy's a little baby ones in his
fish tank.

516
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,780
There are vicious little creature.
I mean they actually stay.

517
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,630
I mean that's what's blows me away as
they start that small.

518
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,280
Yeah.
And he's fucking with them right here.

519
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,140
Yeah,
we mean you can.

520
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,150
I think you can have them in a fish
tank.

521
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,470
Oh,
he's feeding them a fish.

522
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,940
Oh yeah.
That's a whole fish.

523
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,100
Yeah.
Dinosaurs.

524
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,850
Yeah.
How long have alligator guards been

525
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,090
around?
Find out.

526
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,620
I think.
I'm going to guess.

527
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,350
I'm going to guess 30 million years.
They've been that way.

528
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,330
It might be more $30.
Million alligators I think has been.

529
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,120
They've been around before the
dinosaurs.

530
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,850
Straight down and they've been around I
think in the same forum since.

531
00:22:57,851 --> 00:23:00,490
Before that meteor hit looking like
that?

532
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:01,750
Yeah,
I think so.

533
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,670
I might be wrong.
First description is 10.

534
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:07,690
Oh,
three.

535
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,820
The first description of them.
Yeah,

536
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,800
but like how long have they been in
that?

537
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,960
I don't know how you find that out.
How would you find that out?

538
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,110
Whatever.
Oldest fuck.

539
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,570
Dinosaur fish.
I mean I'm used to seeing those people

540
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:22,330
pull out big carp and catfish,
but I've never.

541
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,160
I've never seen anything like that.
Yeah,

542
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:26,680
those are big ass fish.
They bow hunt for them too.

543
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,230
That's what I was going to ask you.
That one picture looked like it had a

544
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:30,970
bow in it,
so they do.

545
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,170
A lot of people do that,
go in those those rivers and they do it

546
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:37,270
at night too,
that they'll have like spotlights.

547
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,430
So you see the fish in the water,
you're shooting something and it's like

548
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:44,260
six feet away from you and they use like
recurve bows that are made designed just

549
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:48,380
for both and they have like a spool on
it and shoot it into it and then they

550
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:52,730
just pull it in by hand or they have a
real say how they pulling that thing

551
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,550
wherever 300 pounds it takes forever.

552
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,530
Yeah.
There's some videos of guys catching

553
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:58,490
them.
It's fucking crazy.

554
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:02,840
When you watch them fight these things.
See if you get a video of a guy catching

555
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,930
an alligator Gar kinda test line.
You got to have for an alligator braided

556
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,540
braided line that they have that like
heavy duty braided line and they use a

557
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:16,370
leader like a wire leader.
Big Ass fucking hooks go for up to 40

558
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,970
grand for a aquarium and the Japanese
black market,

559
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:22,130
it says 40.
Those little ones,

560
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:27,080
like we just saw the size,
it just says that the 40 grand in Japan.

561
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:29,810
Huh?
Fifteen to as high as 40.

562
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,950
Oh,
just say black markets.

563
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:33,710
It's probably illegal.
And there's an article if someone

564
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:35,410
getting arrested for it.
Dude,

565
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,000
that was.
I'm in Maryland.

566
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:40,760
This thing happened,
I don't know the full story,

567
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:42,500
but it was called snake heads.

568
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,260
Um,
and I think somebody put them in the

569
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:48,750
water.
They're from Africa and they bred.

570
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,190
Wow.
That thing.

571
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,051
Yeah.
They,

572
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:54,270
they take over those snake heads.
That's a real common thing.

573
00:24:54,271 --> 00:24:57,660
And sometimes what they do is they'll
poison everything in the lake to kill

574
00:24:57,661 --> 00:25:01,080
the snake heads and then start from
scratch and the restock the lake.

575
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,210
So that's definitely somebody put that
in there.

576
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:03,541
Yeah.
Yeah,

577
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,400
definitely.
I think snake heads,

578
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:06,900
like I said,
I think they're from Africa,

579
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,090
but they're from somewhere else for
sure.

580
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,910
This.
Yeah.

581
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,540
This guy he's got.
Oh,

582
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,780
walk in monster on there.
How do you get the hook out of the

583
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,653
mouth?

584
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,430
Maybe it's just too tired by the end.
It just gives up.

585
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,980
May Look at that.
Yeah.

586
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,010
But again,
they are good to eat this.

587
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:28,770
Apparently they taste delicious.
Especially when you smoke them.

588
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,290
It's got to feel good to fight that
thing all day.

589
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:33,840
Bring it in and eat it.
That's got to feel good.

590
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,930
I've got some pretty good size fish,
but nothing like that.

591
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:41,190
I kind of Marlin,
once they do that was like a 70 pounds.

592
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:42,870
Not,
not a giant one know.

593
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:44,760
But it was like five minutes into
fishing.

594
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,220
Yeah.
How long did it take you to bring it in?

595
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,440
About a half hour.
That's damn good.

596
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,240
Yeah.
It wasn't that big.

597
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,130
Seventy pounds from Marlin.
I'm not.

598
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:58,131
The biggest guy in the boat said that
they've caught him close to a thousand

599
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,710
pounds a thousand.
Your mom,

600
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,570
I think.
I think they go a thousand pounds.

601
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,370
They're fucking huge.
Like what do you think?

602
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,170
What's the World Record Marlin?
Find that out.

603
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,980
Like right off of Malibu.
Malibu sport fishing.

604
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:16,400
It's a great place to go fishing.
It's just there's not a lot of people

605
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:17,234
out here that go.

606
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:22,390
I went deep sea fishing,
so while ago now off of A.

607
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,530
I think it might have been out of
Huntington.

608
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:29,531
We rented a boat just like six of us.
The world record is 1,376 pounds caught

609
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:33,170
off Kona in 1982.
Woo.

610
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:33,670
That's a big,
big

611
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,060
fish.
Dam Twenty.

612
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,870
Damn man.
I mean that's a boat.

613
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,490
Yeah.
As a giant fish and they fly through the

614
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:47,280
air two and you're fighting them.
That's pretty sure that they get up.

615
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,173
Yeah.

616
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,850
Yeah.
I went deep sea fishing out here.

617
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,760
It was like six of us because I didn't
want to do the,

618
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,820
you know,
fucking everybody leaning over your face

619
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:57,840
and stick and,
and shit.

620
00:26:57,841 --> 00:26:59,340
So we go out here,
it's in the more,

621
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:02,400
you know,
before the sun comes up and we're

622
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:06,540
heading out to meet the,
the sardine boat that's coming back in

623
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,640
that's going to sell bait everybody and
we're getting everything.

624
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:10,080
All these guys knew what they were
doing.

625
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:11,550
Everything fresh,
everything fresh.

626
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,720
And just as the sun starts coming up,
we hit a pod of dolphins.

627
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:17,100
I mean baby ones,
everything.

628
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:19,830
And I just was like,
if I don't catch a fish all fucking day,

629
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:21,660
this is app already worth it.
I mean,

630
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:24,120
they're just right next to his playing,
playing,

631
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,000
um,
and if this guy was so good,

632
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:30,810
if we didn't drop our line and pull
something up on the first one,

633
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:32,730
he played,
pick them up and he did take us with his

634
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:34,620
depth finder,
go find something else and we'd go by

635
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:36,660
those big boats,
have everybody reaching across and be

636
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:37,310
like,
look at that guy.

637
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,030
So that could be you.
Today we're having a beer,

638
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:41,790
we're having lunch.
I didn't know,

639
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,760
I just never considered it,
but I didn't know a fish could get the

640
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:47,400
bends.
It fucked me up when I'm selling.

641
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,770
Yeah,
because the eyes were all.

642
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,640
It looked like it at a tongue sticking
out and shit.

643
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:51,390
I'm like,
what says?

644
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,440
He's like,
you gave it the bends.

645
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:53,251
I'm like,
oh,

646
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,200
that makes sense.
I'm bringing it up and I guess a fish

647
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:58,050
can get the bends,
but best fucking fish.

648
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,580
So guy,
you know,

649
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:01,650
on the way back in,
he's cleaning it.

650
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,150
Packs it all.
Nice for you.

651
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,830
It's not here.
It was out here.

652
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,330
Did you go?
It was awful.

653
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:08,310
Huntington,
I think out of Huntington beach there

654
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,240
was like a pro,
you know,

655
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:11,970
just hit them up and it's like a dude
and owns his own boat and he's like six

656
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:12,780
of you come,
you know,

657
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,160
we'll have plenty of room.

658
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,080
You guys can walk to the front and back
of the boat,

659
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:19,080
fish wherever you want.
You got a choice to either chum for

660
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:22,850
shark or fish and he's like,
it's ours a me chumming it's,

661
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,290
it's Kinda boring until we actually
start getting at it.

662
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,940
So if you want to fish,
we'll do this.

663
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:30,150
And we did that through packs it all up.
So nice for us.

664
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,180
I'm all excited.
I just moved out here and not long.

665
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:35,010
I'm living in this dump in north
Hollywood.

666
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:37,560
I put my fish into fucking freezer and a
fridge.

667
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:40,380
What I've never done,
I've never.

668
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,580
It's stuck so bad.
I called my buddy.

669
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:46,290
I'm like,
I'm coming over to have some of your

670
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,124
functions

671
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,790
all ruined.
But it was,

672
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,240
it was such a good time.
Such a careful eating sharks today.

673
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:55,220
People get mad at you for sharks.
Really?

674
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,450
Yeah.
That's a new thing.

675
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,900
People think that sharks are endangered,
they seen so many things about shark fin

676
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:02,960
soup that if you pull on a shark,
people get angry at you.

677
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,930
He used to be biddable caught sharks and
no one gave a fuck.

678
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,160
They saw jaws.
They're like,

679
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:08,870
fuck shark.
But now everyone,

680
00:29:08,871 --> 00:29:13,130
we have to save the sharks.
Save 'em say this sharks,

681
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,860
what are you doing with that chart?
And let it go.

682
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,910
Um,
there was uh,

683
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,530
a photo of.
Was it the governor of New York or the

684
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:23,120
mayor of New York City?
One of those,

685
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,380
I think it was the governor of New York
caught a shark and people were pissed at

686
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:28,220
him and he's like,
no,

687
00:29:28,221 --> 00:29:29,750
we fucking ate it.
We cooked it up.

688
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:31,220
We ate it.
Shark tastes good.

689
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,350
Like it's totally illegal.
Like just had it in restaurant.

690
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,350
Yeah.
Good.

691
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,540
But people are loony with shit.
Like,

692
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,040
here it is.
What is this

693
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,040
heard about?
That he got his dick bid off.

694
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,340
Yes.
I just saw this

695
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,090
guy rips off his penis despite
horrified,

696
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:55,840
sunbathers frantic battle to save his
life under Brazilian beach,

697
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,170
g zealous.
And apparently this is a really,

698
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:04,120
really rare attack.
They don't get a lot of attacks in

699
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:09,100
Brazil because the water's so warm,
but apparently that shark didn't get the

700
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:09,790
menu.

701
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,650
Clearly.
I,

702
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,270
I thought I saw.
They thought it was a tiger shark.

703
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,000
That's a fucking shark shark.
Well,

704
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:20,350
obviously I'm a bit bit his pelvis off,
right with a dick goes.

705
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,170
I can't even.
I mean,

706
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:24,430
that's basically like your leg.

707
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,850
You're swilling around and just gets in
between their

708
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,250
snack.
Fuck.

709
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,440
Fuck that man.
I just,

710
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,960
that's.
It scares the shit out of me about the

711
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:38,890
water man.
That you don't.

712
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:40,960
You don't even see it common.
At least if you're in the woods,

713
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,630
you kinda hear thing is.
That's right.

714
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,290
You got the hearing.
You don't even have that gun.

715
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,030
You know,
you know what's out there.

716
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,200
Nothing out there is ground in the
ocean.

717
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,460
You know what I mean?
Right here.

718
00:30:52,461 --> 00:30:55,150
She'll hear shit until it's too late and
then this will.

719
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,830
It's you,

720
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,280
you read in front of your face.
You're like,

721
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:01,780
fuck,
this is how it's going to end.

722
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,610
All those road gigs I did.

723
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:08,560
Oh,
go on my airline miles airline miles

724
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,560
ago.
Open mikes

725
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,520
go out like this.
You know,

726
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:17,650
um,
I've been thinking about this and

727
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:19,240
talking about this on stage a little
bit,

728
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:22,540
but the,
as far as depth goes to go out of the

729
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:26,600
most beautiful way I've ever seen any
creature on this little rocket outer

730
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:31,090
space go out.
The most original beautiful way is that

731
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:36,091
dove that got killed by Randy Johnson.
It's the best death on planet earth.

732
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,510
What are the odds of.
That's what I'm saying.

733
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,250
That place at that time.
That's what I'm saying.

734
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,570
Do you know how many billions of fucking
birds have been on this planet?

735
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,860
You know what?
They died of,

736
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:49,810
uh,
Randy Johnson fastball one,

737
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,673
one,
one.

738
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,560
You could even narrow it down to how
many birds were in that area that day.

739
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:57,370
I don't care that one one.
And when he hit it,

740
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,600
it blew up into its own.

741
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,140
Like fireworks went out.
Kapo was like,

742
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,790
Oh yeah,
there it is.

743
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,980
It's there.
I know this.

744
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,180
It fucked him up.
Did it?

745
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,120
Yeah.
And then he ended up winning.

746
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:11,920
They won the world series.
This is in spring training.

747
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:14,440
The same year they won the world series.
He won co Mvp,

748
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:18,180
I think he split it with curt schilling
and um,

749
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,440
now he's got it.
I just looked this up recently because

750
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,070
he's got a company now and I think he
uses the logo of like an upside down

751
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:26,500
burden is embraced it,
but he was like,

752
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:28,660
that's not funny.
I don't think that Shit's funny.

753
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,150
You know,
he threw 100 mile an hour fast ball.

754
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,140
I mean pieced.

755
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,940
He was a fucking beast.
Now let me ask you this.

756
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,130
What do they do?
How do they,

757
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,160
how do count that pitch?

758
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,290
They stats.
It's just considered a dead pitch.

759
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:45,860
They said it was a no pitch,
rolled it off like we're going to reset

760
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:46,870
on that.
Wow.

761
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,300
Was,
was randy fucked up like it bothered

762
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:49,791
him.
I mean,

763
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,640
he talked about it like people were
making jokes and shit and he was like,

764
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:54,640
I don't think that Shit's funny.
Uh,

765
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,030
but

766
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,920
it's beautiful.
Even if you don't think it's fun.

767
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,400
It is fun.
Well wonder what they did with the dunk.

768
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,240
They should cook it because doves are
delicious.

769
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,670
I've never have had pheasant.
I've never had dove pheasants.

770
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,570
Delicious.
But dove is a highly,

771
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:14,870
people don't know that it's another one
that people get angry if you bring up

772
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,630
pheasant or because it's a bird of
peace,

773
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,750
but it's a highly prized game.
Bird,

774
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,950
like people go dove hunting and they'll
shoot fuckloads of doves and take them

775
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:26,870
home and cook them.
And He tell people that they get so

776
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:27,710
angry.
Like,

777
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,170
what are you doing?
You're cooking doves.

778
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,290
Stop it.
Stop it.

779
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:38,340
You want some chicken?
I'll have the chicken prisoners ground

780
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:43,910
up into small cubes,
but not the dove.

781
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:46,160
The dove is about peace.
That's it.

782
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,170
It's a fucking bird.
It's just a bird.

783
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:49,460
Has No idea what it is.

784
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:49,761
Like.
Oh,

785
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,920
don't eat that eagle.
Okay.

786
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,300
Okay.
I won't eat the Eagle.

787
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,390
Eagles get so plentiful that like
pigeons.

788
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,950
Do you think they'll let us eat?
Eagles?

789
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,930
No.
Never.

790
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,870
Never.
Never.

791
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,350
Never going to let you touch.
He never.

792
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,400
I don't care if they're starting to
attack us and lift us off.

793
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:06,900
They're not letting us touching it that
way.

794
00:34:06,901 --> 00:34:09,890
Here
they were here first.

795
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:12,920
The Ego was in North America before the
white man.

796
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,000
They were here first.
Yeah man.

797
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,750
Um,
I have friends that live in Alaska.

798
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,370
You go up there,
dude,

799
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,580
and you see eagles everywhere.
Just fucking everywhere.

800
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,530
They're everywhere.
They're like pigeons.

801
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,460
Weird.

802
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,350
It is.
I had this moment.

803
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:28,490
I'm so,
I didn't even think.

804
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:29,930
I'm so glad you said that.
I,

805
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:33,500
um,
my daughter's mother,

806
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:36,560
her family is from Seattle and they live
right on Lake Washington.

807
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,490
They're good friends.
Bill Gates is around the corner.

808
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,920
It's beautiful and they do this.
It's called seafarer weekend where all

809
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:45,620
the boats come out,
blue angels,

810
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:47,090
the whole nine,
like beautiful.

811
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,530
And they rehearse for like a couple days
before the actual event.

812
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:54,650
So I swim out into the middle of.
I smoke a joint,

813
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,600
the beautiful Pacific rim.
We,

814
00:34:57,601 --> 00:35:01,450
they have up in Seattle and I smoke a
joint and I swim out into the middle of

815
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,640
Lake Washington.
I'm just out there treading on my back

816
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:06,770
float and having a good time.
And they had been saying there's this

817
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,930
bald eagle that had been circling.
It's got a nest,

818
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,520
a couple houses up,
whatever.

819
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,700
I swear to fucking God.
This is the God's honest truth.

820
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,160
There's a boat also for people who see
it to two eagles come out together in

821
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:22,030
tandem as a team.
One of them start circling here,

822
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,650
this motherfucker nose dives into the
water.

823
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:26,450
I'm in,
grabs a fish and flies off.

824
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:26,920
And I said,

825
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,410
Oh,
oh my God.

826
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,840
Like it was um,
and the people in the boat or clap

827
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:31,674
clapping.
I was like,

828
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,120
Holy Shit.
It was

829
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,090
fucking amazing.
Wow.

830
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,340
Amazing into the water.
I was and boom,

831
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,120
out.
And they work together.

832
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,180
I don't.
I mean I have no,

833
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:47,190
I to just sorta snatched him.
He gone beacon and out peak.

834
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,430
So maybe it was feet.
He might've went his feet.

835
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:52,530
He had to go feet.
He went feet and boom.

836
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:54,900
Lifted it off.
But his solid feet in real life.

837
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,060
Their town.
The fucking trigger in our hands.

838
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:58,890
Yeah.
It's like a giant basketball player.

839
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:03,891
Hand with clause.
Cause I've seen those videos online

840
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:06,810
where they like lift toddlers up and
start to fly away.

841
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:09,030
But they're a little too heavy.
I don't think so.

842
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:10,710
No.
I think that's been proven that those

843
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,000
were horseshit.
That's bullshit.

844
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:13,560
What about this?
I've seen the goat.

845
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:15,280
That's dropped one down amount.
That's.

846
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,790
Yeah,
that's Golden Eagles.

847
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,620
They're the biggest ones.
They're bigger than bald eagles.

848
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,710
They grab them and they.
I think they even have those in

849
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:23,970
California.
Believe it or not.

850
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,770
Golden Eagles learn a lot today.
Yeah.

851
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,240
Yeah.
This fucker about this one.

852
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,083
This.
So Fox.

853
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,720
Fox.
Fox has got his little boom.

854
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:35,340
The Eagle comes and snatches him.
It's like,

855
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:36,510
no bitch.
Let's go.

856
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,221
No,
no,

857
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:37,521
no,
no,

858
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:37,841
no,
no,

859
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:38,131
no,
no,

860
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:39,350
no.
I'm hanging on motherfucker.

861
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,570
I'm hanging on motherfucker and the
eagles like,

862
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,091
all right,
bitch.

863
00:36:42,091 --> 00:36:42,924
I'll let you go.

864
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,430
Yeah.
It's funny that that's our national

865
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:51,230
animal because it is a ruthless fucking
flying cunt is.

866
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,190
It's heartless.
You look in their eyes is just death.

867
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,530
Yeah,
just twitchy eye.

868
00:36:58,531 --> 00:37:01,560
Fucking death.
Big Old Flying Lizard.

869
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:04,140
You do a good ball.
You go with a hatchet for a face.

870
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,570
Just kinda pair of bolt cutters for a
face.

871
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:09,120
I watched this.
They had this video online.

872
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:13,290
It was live videos of bald eagles having
babies and you could watch them.

873
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,180
They had cameras set up on them and
everything.

874
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:16,710
It was fascinating.
It ended.

875
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,070
It ended terribly though.
The they showed you how the mom would

876
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:25,071
sit and the dad would go out and hunt
and then he came back and he would just,

877
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,360
his shift was like an hour or two and
she was the rest of the time,

878
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:33,660
but he would go out and bring food back
and the poor thing,

879
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,750
I think it was the mom going to get
food.

880
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,090
It got fucking hit by a commercial
airline.

881
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,330
Got Hit by jet on a landing and killed
the mom.

882
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,030
Oh Wow.
And so they had to help the birds

883
00:37:45,031 --> 00:37:47,690
because the dads don't go,
you know,

884
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,340
that would've been the end of their ass.
So I think that'll,

885
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,250
I don't know what they do.
They might.

886
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:56,400
They're savage fucking birds.
Bird Ravens to.

887
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:58,230
I learned about ravens being a raving
fan.

888
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:01,380
I watched this documentary one time,
just the fucking lady in England had a

889
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:02,580
rave in a pet.
Raven,

890
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,200
you know,
that British,

891
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,080
that little that it's like an upside
down u.

892
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,970
That car,
that weird old car.

893
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:10,620
It's just a,
it's just like a little,

894
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,130
like a parentheses upside down.
Yeah.

895
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,300
This,
she had a pet raven.

896
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,380
That was,
they said,

897
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:20,130
I guess they're the most intelligent
bird and this thing.

898
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,340
She would keep the keys in the ignition
and the windows down and she'd be like,

899
00:38:23,341 --> 00:38:26,430
we're going to go for a ride,
and the raven would fly into car,

900
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,670
start the car with its beak,
sit on the door.

901
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,140
She'd get in,
she'd start driving,

902
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,890
and then he would just fly right next to
the car wherever she.

903
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,170
It was unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

904
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:41,430
I could knock it over it.
So she had like a relationship with this

905
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,290
100 percent and this raven knew and
loved it.

906
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,340
Like he was like,
Oh shit,

907
00:38:45,341 --> 00:38:48,940
let me go start the car for you.
She would say,

908
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,940
let's go for a drive.
And the Raven knew what she was saying

909
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,820
out out,
boom in the car,

910
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,680
grabbed that shit with.
It's because they're big.

911
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,280
They're big too,
and just turn those little keys and he

912
00:39:00,281 --> 00:39:02,300
would wait for her to get in.
She'd start driving.

913
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,480
You just fly right next to it.
I don't know.

914
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:06,130
You might look for it,
but I watched it.

915
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:10,030
They're.
So I saw video one using a tool to get

916
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:13,070
another tool.
So that it could get into something like

917
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:17,200
they did these tests to find out how
they intelligent they were to see if

918
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:22,150
they could do problem solving to get
food and so it had to use like one small

919
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:26,140
stick in order to pull out a larger
stick and the larger stick to pull out

920
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:29,410
this thing that got them the food and
they figured it out and figured it out

921
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:32,860
quick,
quicker than my kids would have this

922
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,520
much of this raven like damn this thing
smarter than an eight year old.

923
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,670
It's crazy.
It's crazy watching it do it.

924
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:43,690
It's like this little conniving fucker.
There's a great video.

925
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:46,600
One of my favorite videos online of this
one.

926
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:49,750
Raven that taunts these two cats into a
fight.

927
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,200
It stares at them up into a fight.
Yeah,

928
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,640
they're both.
What is this lady?

929
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:58,390
Go raving crazy bitch.
Whoever you are,

930
00:39:58,391 --> 00:40:01,690
if you stick your penis in that lady,
you deserve everything you got coming to

931
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:02,920
you.
Everything.

932
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:04,780
What the fuck?
You fix it in that bag.

933
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,850
Oh my God.
I don't know.

934
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,870
Look at that heads.
Heads.

935
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,250
Baby heads is dude over here.
Just chill.

936
00:40:13,251 --> 00:40:14,500
And like it's nothing.
Yeah.

937
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,390
That look on her.
If the guy next,

938
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,040
he's just checking his twitter,
he probably doesn't even know.

939
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,140
He hasn't even looked over.
Nobody sitting next to that bitch

940
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:26,440
though.
Like I'll stand all the way I look at

941
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:28,090
it.
I mean everything about her looks weird.

942
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:30,220
She's like,
when do I kill myself today?

943
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:34,450
Not Today.
When she looks crazy.

944
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:37,470
Pitch with metal over boots.
Show your goth.

945
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:38,304
Hold it.
What does it say?

946
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,830
Sure you're goth by.
But are you dejectedly riding the subway

947
00:40:41,831 --> 00:40:45,610
with
the bar right there.

948
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:46,444
Everybody.

949
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,140
See if you can find the raven provokes
hats.

950
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,960
It's one of my favorite videos because
there's just two cats and they're on

951
00:40:55,961 --> 00:40:57,970
opposite rooftops,
like right next to each other.

952
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,300
And they're like,
wow,

953
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,100
look at each other's raven comes over
and fucks with one of the cats.

954
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:02,980
Like,
come on man.

955
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,590
Come on man.
It is.

956
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,550
So the cat's chillin.
And then the raven flies over to where

957
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:13,750
the cat is and starts fucking with him.
And after he starts fucking with them,

958
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:17,230
then he flies over to where the other
cat is and he starts fucking with him.

959
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,210
So he gets behind and he's like,
hey bitch,

960
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,280
what are you doing?
He gets just close enough with the

961
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:22,840
Catholic mother fuckers.
Like none.

962
00:41:22,841 --> 00:41:25,540
Anoma fly back over here and gonna fuck
with this cost.

963
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,720
But he's doing it on purpose.
It's a little cut.

964
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,590
Like you could tell.
He's just getting the cats riled up.

965
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:33,440
Hey Bitch,
look,

966
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:35,370
I'm a bird and I'm right behind you
motherfucker.

967
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,520
He's cats like,
no,

968
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:36,831
no,
no,

969
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:38,030
no.
I'm going to get this other cat.

970
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,470
And then looked at each of the cats
like,

971
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:41,330
fuck you.
Fuck you.

972
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,620
No,
fuck you.

973
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,480
Look,
he's keeps getting closer to the cat.

974
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,240
Why would a rave and get close to a cat?
I mean,

975
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:48,650
why?
Why would any bird?

976
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:50,780
Yeah.
The only reason why is because he's

977
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:52,790
fucking with him.
He's doing it on paper.

978
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:53,620
Him,

979
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:58,080
you know,
it gets over there.

980
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,890
There was like,
oh,

981
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,550
now it's happening.
Oh,

982
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:04,610
they fall off the roof together.
Flies down.

983
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,960
He's right next to my faggots.
These cats are killing each other.

984
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,710
And this rave was like,
you dumb hose.

985
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,440
Oh look.
They fall into that hole.

986
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,660
Now,
raven is just hanging out with them,

987
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,720
an animal that can fly on the ground
vulnerable.

988
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:26,721
Watching these two cats fight two steps.
He jumped into the whole.

989
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,290
That is a crazy ass bird.
That is a crazy fucking bird,

990
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,930
but also confident,
right?

991
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,990
He knows how quick he can move.
He coming in from the side like that

992
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:37,470
happen at his tail.
He's like,

993
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,340
no,
you're not done yet.

994
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,370
That cat is still alive,
motherfucker.

995
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:45,690
What kind of a pussy are you?
It's such a weird,

996
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,870
weird animal.
Like once they found out that these

997
00:42:48,871 --> 00:42:49,860
things are smart,
they're like,

998
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:53,970
look in comparative tests when it comes
to like problem solving there are as

999
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,460
smart or smarter than chimpanzees.
Ravens.

1000
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,050
Yes.
Yeah.

1001
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:57,930
Here,
here's what I hear.

1002
00:42:57,931 --> 00:42:59,460
They're super smart,
super smart.

1003
00:42:59,461 --> 00:43:03,960
Like they don't know how smart that the
limitation is that they've got these

1004
00:43:03,961 --> 00:43:07,120
feet and wings,
but if you gave him like fingers in had.

1005
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,720
I'm like,
problem solve stuff like spell their

1006
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:12,180
name and Shit and you know,
you give them some food.

1007
00:43:12,181 --> 00:43:15,330
They might be able to do that because
chimps can kind of do stuff like that.

1008
00:43:15,331 --> 00:43:17,100
Here's one.
Look at this Raven,

1009
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,890
a crow crow,
raven pro.

1010
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,470
Pretty set.
What is the difference?

1011
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,970
Is the Raven bigger?
Yeah.

1012
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,240
A lot bigger.
Yeah,

1013
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,800
but they're all smart.
So this little fucker realizes that if

1014
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:32,250
he puts these rocks in that water,
that the water float up and he'll be

1015
00:43:32,251 --> 00:43:34,590
able to get that food so you can't quite
reach that food.

1016
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,970
So he keeps dropping those rocks in
there to try to raise the level of the

1017
00:43:38,971 --> 00:43:41,940
water up.
How the fuck does he figure that out,

1018
00:43:41,941 --> 00:43:42,610
man?
Like,

1019
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,550
look at that.
That's crazy.

1020
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,360
Oh,
I said he's like,

1021
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,070
no,
no,

1022
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,250
not quite.
Almost almost

1023
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,150
wish I could just get it.
Oh Gosh.

1024
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,730
Light versus heavy.
What does this all kinds of experiments

1025
00:43:57,731 --> 00:43:59,170
with them.
Oh Wow.

1026
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,540
Look at that.
It says it's a casual understanding of

1027
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:03,880
water displacement by a cro.
Is the name of the video

1028
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,680
study done by Auckland,
New Zealand.

1029
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:09,490
The university will just makes you
think,

1030
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,340
right?
Like we always define intelligence by

1031
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,770
how much can they manipulate and its
environment.

1032
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:17,950
And where that throws us off is like
dolphins and orcas and whales because

1033
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:21,430
they're really smart and they can't.
They can't do anything.

1034
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,680
They have flippers,
but we know they have these really

1035
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:27,940
complex languages and Qa and they have.
They have Baltimore accents.

1036
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,210
Do you know that dolphins,
dolphins,

1037
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,770
and orchids have accents do that?
Yeah.

1038
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,180
I can tell.
They can't tell what the fuck they're

1039
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:38,190
saying,
but they can tell where they're from

1040
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:39,870
really.
So it's a regional thing,

1041
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:43,770
not like a bottle.
Nose versus a spotted has a different

1042
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:46,020
accent from different spots of the
world.

1043
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,360
They have different accents.
They make different sounds.

1044
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,150
No Shit.
Yeah,

1045
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:54,420
I know that.
We used to fuck with bats when we were

1046
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:55,950
little.
You ever mess around bats?

1047
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,250
No,
but I've been in Austin for the largest

1048
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:04,251
migration in the northern hemisphere.
I think Austin has the largest

1049
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:09,831
migration,
like its largest daily migration of bats

1050
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:11,100
in North America.
Daily.

1051
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,350
Yeah.
It's crazy when it gets dark out.

1052
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,830
Look at all those bats.
They fly out from under the bridge.

1053
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,950
There's A.
There's a bridge in downtown Austin,

1054
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,210
Bro.
It's crazy.

1055
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,850
It's crazy.
So we're staying in this hotel and

1056
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:24,481
they're telling us,
hey,

1057
00:45:24,481 --> 00:45:27,240
when it gets dark out,
that bridge over there,

1058
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:30,450
they're like all the bats nest in that
bridge and they come out.

1059
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:34,500
So during the daytime I was with my
family with walked under the bridge and

1060
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:39,000
you hear that cluster is hanging
underneath the bridge.

1061
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,430
You go under the bridge here.
That shit.

1062
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,710
Look at that dude.
It's millions.

1063
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,800
Millions and millions of fucking bats go
flying through the air.

1064
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,320
It's crazy to watch.
What is it about?

1065
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:54,120
What does it say there?
What does this pull it back to?

1066
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:57,330
The beginning it says from March through
April,

1067
00:45:57,331 --> 00:45:59,970
millions of mostly female pregnant
Mexican,

1068
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:04,890
free tailed bats migrate north,
give birth the new Congress Avenue

1069
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,340
Bridge in downtown Austin,
Texas is the spring and summer home to

1070
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:10,440
these bats.
Each night at sunset,

1071
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:15,441
some 2 million bats venture out from
under the bridge to eat an estimated

1072
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:20,660
30,000 pounds of insects.
It is the largest urban bat colony in

1073
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:24,180
North America.
And then he watched the departure play

1074
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:25,590
that video.
Cc this departure.

1075
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:28,020
It's fucking bananas,
Dude.

1076
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,540
You can't believe how many bats fly out.
You're like,

1077
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:33,210
what?
That they all just pick this one

1078
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:35,670
neighborhood.
There's one bridge.

1079
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:38,520
They decided this is our spot,
and so they just live in this bridge,

1080
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,290
so somebody detonated that bridge.

1081
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,660
Look at that.
It looks like night.

1082
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,290
It's crazy,
dude.

1083
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:45,510
It's crazy.
I was there for this is.

1084
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:50,700
It's wild to watch.
You just see them like like a swarm like

1085
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:53,430
insects.
How are they not running into each other

1086
00:46:53,431 --> 00:46:55,110
like that?
Knocking themselves down.

1087
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:57,140
That's a good question.
Look how tight that is.

1088
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:00,090
A head butt.
Each other people could barely get on

1089
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:04,700
the subway together without stepping on
toes and things are flying fly.

1090
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,810
They say that they have some sort of a
magnetic sense.

1091
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,140
They understand like there's a frequency
that each one of those animals gives

1092
00:47:13,141 --> 00:47:14,850
off.
That's how birds do it.

1093
00:47:14,851 --> 00:47:17,400
Like they ever see birds.
They move together in these crazy

1094
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:18,670
patterns.
Yeah.

1095
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,230
No one understands it totally,
but one,

1096
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,600
there's a company called Hex h e c x a
hecs and they make this thing called a

1097
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,490
heck suit.
It's a very controversial thing,

1098
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:35,410
but what the idea behind it is that
there's an electric frequency that all

1099
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,790
humans and animals and especially like a
predators game,

1100
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:44,560
animals give off and that this,
this frequency is it corresponds to the

1101
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:48,520
movement of your muscles and that you
give off this thing that that animals

1102
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:50,830
can see,
especially predators like predators.

1103
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:53,950
Apparently a really good at seeing this,
but holy shit.

1104
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,600
Where are these local stores

1105
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,010
say now?
I've been through something like that in

1106
00:47:58,011 --> 00:47:59,900
Maryland.
They used to have a while.

1107
00:47:59,901 --> 00:48:00,410
They don't.
They.

1108
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,410
They do.
The cicadas would come through and it

1109
00:48:03,411 --> 00:48:07,040
would look like this and they would
litter the streets and the sidewalks.

1110
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,373
Well,
locusts.

1111
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,590
That just grasshoppers under certain
conditions.

1112
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,570
Right.
How does that work?

1113
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:17,830
Grasshoppers under certain conditions
become locus.

1114
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,360
Yeah.
I forget.

1115
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,450
I mean in five seconds he just filled
that Netapp.

1116
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:23,730
Yeah.
What do you do with them though?

1117
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,750
You eat them.
Eat them.

1118
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:29,020
I don't know if I'd eat that.
I'm down to try different shit.

1119
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,880
Yes.
I've had cricket chocolate covered

1120
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:32,620
though.
Mexico.

1121
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,220
We stayed at a resort once in Mexico and
you go into the hotel room,

1122
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,590
you know,
they have like a little table there and

1123
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:42,430
they have like a little table full of
peanuts with like,

1124
00:48:42,431 --> 00:48:45,040
um,
like some hot,

1125
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,340
like hot chili powder on them and stuff
like that.

1126
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:51,700
And then they had these crickets in a
bowl and my kids like,

1127
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,420
why do they have bugs?
I'm like,

1128
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:56,470
you're supposed to eat them.
They're like,

1129
00:48:56,471 --> 00:48:59,080
no way,
you're not eating bugs.

1130
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:01,090
I'm like,
I'm telling you these this year,

1131
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,290
they eat these things.

1132
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,390
And so I picked him up and I started
chewing them.

1133
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:06,340
I'm like,
they're not bad.

1134
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,350
They're like a,
almost like a soy sauce tastes.

1135
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,390
How,
how are they done?

1136
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,900
It looks like they fry them,
like they fried these crickets,

1137
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:17,710
but they're so common that they had a
bowl of them in the room,

1138
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:20,070
you know,
and eat them.

1139
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,160
You know what I would try that.
I would try to,

1140
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,050
I would try that,
but I'm scared of that.

1141
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,720
They say that that might be one of the
futures of,

1142
00:49:28,721 --> 00:49:30,610
uh,
when the weather changes,

1143
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:32,020
grasshoppers turned into,
oh,

1144
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:35,650
it's a weather issue.
Thing I clicked on this from says that

1145
00:49:35,651 --> 00:49:38,580
just by swarming it makes them become a
locus.

1146
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,060
That's it.
I don't know if that's accurate,

1147
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:42,170
but that's what the article is saying.
Oh,

1148
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,980
well it's The New York Times,
unless you listen to Donald Trump,

1149
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,630
which fake news,
right?

1150
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,380
Generally speaking,
I like to trust in New York Times.

1151
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,610
Yeah.
We used to fuck with us,

1152
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,050
so we had a light,
a street light in front of our house and

1153
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:58,120
um,
my brother and I would go out and my dad

1154
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:59,800
was like,
you can go out and play catch as long as

1155
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:01,570
you're in front of that light and I can
see you.

1156
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,540
So we just go start playing catch,
throw a tennis ball round one night.

1157
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:07,630
We're just thrown at high up toward the
light so that you could see it coming

1158
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:11,230
down.
And this bat just starts sweeping at the

1159
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:13,360
ball the whole time.
And I was like,

1160
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:14,410
oh,
this is great.

1161
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,200
So I throw a line,
drive it my brother's fuck of faith,

1162
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:21,700
that fog of battle.
It went right through his hair that the

1163
00:50:21,701 --> 00:50:25,060
gay became became.
You got to be a fucking man.

1164
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:27,860
It's take that shit at your face and
that

1165
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,250
would come down.
It would touch you.

1166
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:33,390
You think the ball was another bad?
I don't know.

1167
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,810
I maybe all the sonar coming after that,
you know,

1168
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,940
I don't know if it thought it was a big
or realized it was a too big of a bug

1169
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,510
when it got there,
you know.

1170
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:43,480
But it would,
it would hit,

1171
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,650
it would come right by your fucking face
man.

1172
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,830
Probably thought is another bat or maybe
something to eat.

1173
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,060
Yeah.
Wow.

1174
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,890
Yeah.
So anyway,

1175
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:55,730
I was seeing this heck suit.
They were these things to destroy their,

1176
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,810
their big with people that go spear
fishing and they wear this suit and you

1177
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:04,130
can like literally get right next to a
fish with his suit on.

1178
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:07,040
It's real weird.
Like whatever this,

1179
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,300
whatever this frequency that human
bodies and bodies in general give off.

1180
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:15,840
This suit masks it and they've been able
to show that with these devices like

1181
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,080
that measure electrical frequencies.

1182
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:23,060
You can rub your arm over Shit,
look like these alligators.

1183
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,590
They just,
for whatever reason,

1184
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,170
don't fuck with this dude while he's
wearing that.

1185
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:31,430
That's a crocodile to do that.
Even though you're moving and there's

1186
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:37,020
what you are and they just don't bother
to understand that it figured out.

1187
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,840
I Dunno,
scientists,

1188
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:42,830
super smart dudes,
but when apparently dudes wear these

1189
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:44,600
suits,
when they go spear fishing,

1190
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:47,780
they're way more successful.
They love these things because you can

1191
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:50,150
get like right up next to these fish and
fuck them up,

1192
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,720
but hunters used them to.
Now they're.

1193
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:55,520
They're becoming popular with hunters.
Oh,

1194
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:58,520
so they don't work just in the water and
I don't know man.

1195
00:51:58,521 --> 00:52:00,740
I've worn them before.
I don't know if they're working or not

1196
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:02,870
working,
so it's hard to tell because what

1197
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:07,040
animals go by is not one thing.
They go buy a bunch of different things.

1198
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,410
The the big one is smell.
If they smell you,

1199
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:12,410
you're fucked.
Like the reason why Cammo works is cammo

1200
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:16,190
breaks up your outline,
like have like a deer saw you.

1201
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:16,821
They'd be like,
oh,

1202
00:52:16,821 --> 00:52:19,070
that's a fucking do.
That is.

1203
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,600
I see the arms,
I see the leg,

1204
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:23,210
that's a dude.
But if you were on camera with all the

1205
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,230
broke,
like my shorts,

1206
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,530
like these shorts broken up pattern.
Right?

1207
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:29,690
So that broken up pattern confuses them.
They were like,

1208
00:52:29,691 --> 00:52:31,250
what is that?
I don't know what I'm seeing.

1209
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,480
And if you just stand still and you were
in Cammo and you don't move a dear look

1210
00:52:35,481 --> 00:52:37,400
at you and go,
I mean shit.

1211
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:39,770
And they'll go back to eating unless
you're close,

1212
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,660
but the smell you.
They're like,

1213
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:43,140
fuck this.
Yeah.

1214
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,000
Especially that real tree stuff.
I see these days look so authentic.

1215
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,960
Like that's not the stuff that works the
best is not interesting.

1216
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,970
No.
Authentic is not what works the best.

1217
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:55,790
What works the best is like there's,
there's a,

1218
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:58,580
a bunch of different companies that make
really good camera,

1219
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,040
but the secret behind it is just
breaking up.

1220
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:03,200
The outline doesn't have to look like
anything.

1221
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,370
It's just a matter of like breaking it
up with like blotches and spots and

1222
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,250
there's a couple of companies like under
armour actually has a really good

1223
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:11,660
pattern.
It's called rich reaper,

1224
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,210
reaper baron,
and that pattern is really good.

1225
00:53:14,211 --> 00:53:19,190
Sitka has probably the best pattern.
They have a pattern called a sub alpine

1226
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,770
open country sub Alpine,
I think it's called,

1227
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:26,670
but it's a,
it's just a bunch of dots and splotches.

1228
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,580
The whole idea is just to break up your,
your outline.

1229
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,370
So when someone looks at you or an
animal looks at you,

1230
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:33,510
they don't know what the fuck they're
saying.

1231
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,230
So the idea is that this heck suit
somehow or another,

1232
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,920
it blocks out your electrical output.

1233
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,000
Whatever that frequency is that these
animals can see and it's,

1234
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:45,830
it's not proven.
It's a,

1235
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:49,140
it's real weird stuff.
It's like we know that there's something

1236
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,720
that gives off,
like these hex companies that they've,

1237
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,130
um,
that one company,

1238
00:53:53,131 --> 00:53:54,720
they have this machine,
they'll show you,

1239
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:58,800
that you wave your hand over this thing
without a heck suit on and it registers

1240
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:02,320
this electrical frequency and then you
wave it with the hexagon and it

1241
00:54:02,321 --> 00:54:05,130
registers nothing.
But if they smell you,

1242
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,990
you're still fucked.
But anyway,

1243
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:11,991
these birds somehow or another,
they're all given off a frequency so

1244
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:15,090
that when they're doing that crazy wave
and they're flying,

1245
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,140
they're flying,
right?

1246
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:19,680
So they're beating their wings together
like a bunch of fucking helicopters,

1247
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:23,070
but they're not touching each other.
They're just floating back and forth

1248
00:54:23,071 --> 00:54:25,080
somehow.
And Somehow it works.

1249
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:27,420
It's a,
it's got to be inches apart,

1250
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:29,220
inches,
inches.

1251
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:34,050
I mean there's these huge migrations of
birds that are flying through the air

1252
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:35,880
and they moved,
like fish in the ocean,

1253
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,740
the same sort of thing,
right?

1254
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,250
And they say that's how fish do it too,
that they have this frequency that

1255
00:54:41,251 --> 00:54:43,860
they're all giving off.
And some somehow or another,

1256
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:47,130
they all know how to move in tandem.
Like Nolan's fuck,

1257
00:54:47,131 --> 00:54:51,870
oh well we're going left and right.
Not Bad to each other.

1258
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:55,260
There's no straggler either.
Like one guy off the fucking side.

1259
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:58,290
It's weird.
I don't understand it,

1260
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,670
but people are trying to capitalize on
whatever that is or high mask,

1261
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:06,060
whatever frequency we give off.
So the idea is that we don't really

1262
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:10,500
totally understand animal senses with.
They've done a bunch of tests on deere.

1263
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:15,090
They know they're colorblind,
they don't see necessarily Greens and.

1264
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:18,220
But they see shapes and the,
they see,

1265
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,850
they just,
their real concern is movement and

1266
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:24,450
outline the outline of a person who's
very recognizable movement is very

1267
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:27,150
recognizable when they smell pretty
good,

1268
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:30,840
but they don't smell nearly as good as
something like bear is apparently one of

1269
00:55:30,841 --> 00:55:35,250
the best at like using their nose.
Bear smell.

1270
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,100
Anything like bears can smell a dead
animal.

1271
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,440
Miles,
miles,

1272
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,320
miles away.

1273
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,153
Yeah.
No,

1274
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:45,710
that would make me nervous if I saw a
dead animal and I was in bear country

1275
00:55:45,711 --> 00:55:47,330
yet.
But we're getting a fuck outta here.

1276
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,510
Fuck Outta here.
My um,

1277
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:54,320
you talking about smells.
So this made me think of this in

1278
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:57,050
Baltimore.
All the street parking's parallel

1279
00:55:57,051 --> 00:55:59,570
parking.
There's no assigned parking spaces and

1280
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:02,330
there's no driveway or anything and my
brother pulls out in front of this guy

1281
00:56:02,331 --> 00:56:03,340
space one,
and the guy's like,

1282
00:56:03,341 --> 00:56:04,480
that's my space.
He's like,

1283
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,620
snipe spaces,
fucking public street.

1284
00:56:06,621 --> 00:56:07,370
I can parker.
He's like,

1285
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:08,870
that's my space in the front of my
house.

1286
00:56:08,871 --> 00:56:10,130
He's like,
dude,

1287
00:56:10,131 --> 00:56:12,260
come on.
So that night,

1288
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:16,700
assuming that guy breaks into his car,
bust his windows out,

1289
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:19,040
takes shit out of his car or whatever.
And he's like,

1290
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:23,710
okay.
And he had some deer piss from hunting.

1291
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:29,050
Any fucking busted that guys when they
dumped it all in his vents and

1292
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:29,831
everything,
I was like,

1293
00:56:29,831 --> 00:56:33,040
I car.
So they're taking turns breaking each

1294
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:36,520
other's what ended after the deer piss
went in there,

1295
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:38,620
that,
that was the last of that shit because

1296
00:56:38,621 --> 00:56:40,090
that stuff.
Do you ever use that?

1297
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:41,770
Do you ever.
You don't ever put it on,

1298
00:56:41,771 --> 00:56:42,970
you know?
Yeah.

1299
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:46,600
That stuff's supposed to it.
I couldn't the smell of it just sitting

1300
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:47,770
on the sidewalk.
I was like,

1301
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:48,980
good God.
Yeah.

1302
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,190
I would think a deer would be like,
why is that though?

1303
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:53,310
Pissing all verse of that crazy
potential.

1304
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:55,600
I want to know if people really use it.
Yeah,

1305
00:56:55,601 --> 00:56:56,390
they do.

1306
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:59,720
They use a cow estrus.
They have like a,

1307
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,990
a smell of a cow.
Cow Bull.

1308
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,600
Like A.
I'm not a cow bull,

1309
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:08,330
a cow elk.
The put it on trees and shit.

1310
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:11,270
Try to drag a bowl over because when,
when bulls are in,

1311
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:14,090
when they're in the Rut and the females
are in heat,

1312
00:57:14,091 --> 00:57:17,060
when they come into estrus and the males
want to breed them,

1313
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,330
apparently they just,
they just smell it and they go fucking

1314
00:57:20,331 --> 00:57:23,840
bananas and some people use that shit.
They'll put it on trees and stuff.

1315
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:27,470
So that's what I wanted to ask you.
Is that more to mask our smell or is it

1316
00:57:27,471 --> 00:57:30,520
more to attract?
They're attracted to attracting them.

1317
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,750
Yeah.
The way they mask our smell,

1318
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:38,050
their sense of smell is so powerful that
it's almost impossible to mask it unless

1319
00:57:38,451 --> 00:57:41,720
you use ozone and so would a lot of guys
do.

1320
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,550
There's a company called Oh,
Xanax,

1321
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:48,290
and what they do is they'll literally
hang a unit above their head and it

1322
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:53,291
blows ozone gas all over your body and
it collects like your scent gets

1323
00:57:55,431 --> 00:58:00,080
combined with the ozone and that hits
the deer and the deer doesn't know what

1324
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:01,970
the fuck you are.
It's like,

1325
00:58:01,971 --> 00:58:03,680
what is that smell?
It just,

1326
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,180
if you ever smelled ozone,
you know what?

1327
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:06,320
No,
I have no idea.

1328
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,990
I'll turn on my tank,
my,

1329
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:08,853
My,
um,

1330
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:11,690
flotation tank,
and you could smell it because they use

1331
00:58:11,691 --> 00:58:14,210
ozone to clean the water,
to purify everything.

1332
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,230
It's got a very distinct smell.
And when you turn the tank filtration

1333
00:58:18,231 --> 00:58:20,570
system on,
you're not supposed to go in it for half

1334
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:22,160
an hour and the ozone disappears.
Dissipates.

1335
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:26,840
But it's got a very distinct smell.
And apparently that smell just

1336
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:31,040
overwhelms the smell of human body.
So when guys sit under a tree stand,

1337
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:34,440
like I've,
I've hunted with my friend John Dudley

1338
00:58:34,441 --> 00:58:38,000
and Iowa,
and he uses this Ozon ics unit above us.

1339
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
He sets it out there on the tree above
us and turns it on.

1340
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:44,420
And it blows ozone over you.
While you're sitting in a tree,

1341
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:49,421
so even if a deer downwind of you,
they might not bolt because the smell is

1342
00:58:49,671 --> 00:58:52,880
confusing to them.
Like what is that fucking weird smell

1343
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,050
like?
They don't know what it is.

1344
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,460
Like if they smell you,
they're like,

1345
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,140
oh,
that's the dude got to go out.

1346
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:59,300
Yeah,
like just a whiff that the wind will

1347
00:58:59,301 --> 00:59:00,320
change.
Like you know,

1348
00:59:00,321 --> 00:59:02,090
most of the times the wind's blowing
east,

1349
00:59:02,091 --> 00:59:03,410
right?
But then a little bit west,

1350
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,450
a little bit of West.
They like the fuck.

1351
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:07,880
They don't take any chances.
They just run.

1352
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,830
But if they smelled that ozone stuff,
they're like,

1353
00:59:09,831 --> 00:59:12,230
what?
What is this fuck?

1354
00:59:12,231 --> 00:59:17,231
Is this?
I don't know.

1355
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:18,743
I just run.

1356
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,160
Take a chance.
Sometimes they just stand

1357
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,220
there when they're horny.
They don't know what their debts.

1358
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:25,880
Why,
why,

1359
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,900
why people like the hunt them in the Rut
because when they're in the Rut,

1360
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:33,020
they come out during the day.
Like a lot of times the older animals,

1361
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:36,620
they become nocturnal.
They just decided it's too risky during

1362
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:40,100
the day people are up.
I'll just just fuck around all night and

1363
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:43,190
sleep during the day.
That's when I was always scared because

1364
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:46,070
we would have a,
there's deer running all over Maryland

1365
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:48,020
when you're driving those country roads
at night,

1366
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,580
I mean three,
four of them will come out cross and in

1367
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:50,991
Shit.
You're like,

1368
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:52,490
holy fuck,
monster,

1369
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,470
Monster.
Um,

1370
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,280
so we had deer whistles,
know if they ever really worked to be

1371
00:59:58,281 --> 00:59:59,220
honest with her.
Yeah.

1372
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,850
You put them in the front of your car
and then you don't hear it.

1373
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:03,710
But apparently they hear it and it's
enough to.

1374
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:06,410
But I had them on and it would still
come right up to the edge of the road

1375
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:07,490
and shit.
Yeah,

1376
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:10,760
they won the ruts going on.
They get confused.

1377
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,980
They don't,
they're just horny and crazy.

1378
01:00:12,981 --> 01:00:15,620
They'll run right out in traffic.
It smashed by cars.

1379
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:19,100
Deers.
That would hide all day long during any

1380
01:00:19,101 --> 01:00:20,580
other time of the year.
Just,

1381
01:00:20,581 --> 01:00:23,830
they just smelled that deer posting just
like,

1382
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:25,640
Oh God.
I mean,

1383
01:00:25,641 --> 01:00:29,030
can you imagine that their nose is a
thousand times stronger than ours?

1384
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,010
Oh fuck.
It is the smell of that posts.

1385
01:00:31,011 --> 01:00:35,570
It must be so tempting.
Run out in traffic in the middle of the

1386
01:00:35,571 --> 01:00:36,560
fucking thing.
For it,

1387
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,230
yeah.
You know,

1388
01:00:39,231 --> 01:00:42,290
and you only got a couple of weeks to
fuck.

1389
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,260
That's all right.
You know it not like they fuck all year

1390
01:00:45,261 --> 01:00:47,810
like us.
They got a couple of weeks to get there,

1391
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:51,760
fuck on.
And then the rest of the year solo know

1392
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:52,970
how weird is it?

1393
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:56,720
Like what kind of a strange system did
nature come up with?

1394
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:02,130
What makes the girls horny and able to
give birth only for a couple of like six

1395
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,930
weeks.
Sometimes they go into estrus again,

1396
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,200
like you have like a second,
a second estrus,

1397
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,230
and then they all figure it out.
Yeah,

1398
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:17,830
it's a male's song and you start
smelling fucking thinking less.

1399
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,910
Apparently as good as they smell,
a bear smells hundreds of times stronger

1400
01:01:22,911 --> 01:01:25,400
than them.
They say a bear smells hundreds of times

1401
01:01:25,401 --> 01:01:28,070
better than a bloodhound does.
That blows my mind.

1402
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:31,010
Great Miles blows my mind mile,
miles away.

1403
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,710
When I drive from here and I get two
miles,

1404
01:01:33,711 --> 01:01:35,120
I'm going to be like,
God damn.

1405
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:37,640
Yeah,
that's a long fucking way to smell.

1406
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:42,590
So what they say is really scary is if
you're in places where bears know that

1407
01:01:42,591 --> 01:01:45,830
people hunt,
they hear a gunshot and they think it's

1408
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:46,730
a dinner bill.

1409
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,180
So like if you shoot a deer,
you only have a certain amount of time

1410
01:01:50,181 --> 01:01:52,910
to get that fucking deer out of there
before bear shows up.

1411
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,830
Especially like Kodiak Island,
Kodiak island is famous for two things,

1412
01:01:57,831 --> 01:02:01,640
is famous for gigantic brown bears,
some of the biggest barriers in the

1413
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:04,230
world.
It's also famous for Sitka blacktail

1414
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,180
deer.
So these,

1415
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:09,380
these sit deer are really delicious deer
and people go over there to hunt them.

1416
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:14,230
But when that gunfire Supine,
that bear hears that as a group and they

1417
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:17,000
go straight towards the sound of that
gunfire because they know there's going

1418
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:20,040
to be a gut pile there soon.
So even if you miss

1419
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,020
you gotta,
there's probably one coming your way.

1420
01:02:22,021 --> 01:02:24,300
Probably no shit.
So you gotta you bought.

1421
01:02:24,301 --> 01:02:27,330
You have to dress it out there too or
just got to get it and haul it out.

1422
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,450
If you got it and leave the gut pile and
take the meat away,

1423
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:33,000
you're likely to just.
The bare probably gonna go to the guts

1424
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,800
and it's probably like,
you're probably going to be safe damn

1425
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:37,920
keyword.
Probably.

1426
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:38,754
Probably.
Yeah.

1427
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,640
I'm a fucking around the Kodiak bear,
my friend Steven Rinella,

1428
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:43,950
who was talking about before they got
attacked last year,

1429
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,680
they got on a fog,
neck island in Alaska.

1430
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:50,760
They got attacked by a gigantic brown
bear and they said it was like 11 feet

1431
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:53,370
long.
It was huge.

1432
01:02:53,371 --> 01:02:56,090
And one of the guys like it ran into
can't.

1433
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,960
Well,
what happened was they had shot an elk

1434
01:02:58,290 --> 01:02:59,440
and they,
um,

1435
01:02:59,490 --> 01:02:59,920
you know,
when,

1436
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,920
when you shoot an elk,
it's an enormous animal.

1437
01:03:01,921 --> 01:03:03,870
You can't really take it out all in one
trip.

1438
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:08,070
You got to make several trips.
So they hung some of it up in a tree and

1439
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:12,000
then they went back to get the rest of
it after they took what they took,

1440
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:14,100
what they could carry,
they went back to get the rest of it.

1441
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,360
When they went back to get the rest of
it,

1442
01:03:15,361 --> 01:03:18,840
a bear had already claimed it and they
didn't know the bear claim because the

1443
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:20,550
bear took off.
I and heard them comment.

1444
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,070
And then the bear when they were hanging
around the meat,

1445
01:03:23,071 --> 01:03:26,410
the was like fuck this,
and decided just to make a run out

1446
01:03:26,411 --> 01:03:28,050
though,
but didn't know how many there were

1447
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:31,400
because it's such thick brush.
And they said it was,

1448
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,240
it happened so quickly like everybody
had this,

1449
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:35,100
well if a bear comes,
I'm going to do this.

1450
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:36,300
You know,
people have this idea.

1451
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,030
It was like,
it happens so fast.

1452
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:41,220
I'll,
I'll send you the podcast because it's

1453
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:43,470
fascinating.
It's a two part podcast.

1454
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:46,500
They did it over two parts where they,
they talked about the experience but

1455
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,790
she's.
Nobody got hurt.

1456
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:52,791
But one guy wound up actually writing
the bears that delay or loud into them

1457
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:59,220
and one guy hit the bear with a trekking
sticks like mountain trekking stick hit

1458
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:01,890
in the head.
And the other guy got knocked over and

1459
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:06,420
was literally on the bears back for
several steps as it was running down the

1460
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:08,250
hill.
And then he fell off of it and then the

1461
01:04:08,251 --> 01:04:09,040
bear took off.

1462
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,920
That thing had momentum downhill coming
at them.

1463
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:13,480
No,
I've seen this video.

1464
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:16,840
They said it was so big,
like my friends who were there,

1465
01:04:16,841 --> 01:04:19,570
four of my friends were there.
They were saying that they could see the

1466
01:04:19,571 --> 01:04:23,740
teeth 10,
11 inches from their face gnashing as

1467
01:04:23,741 --> 01:04:28,270
the thing ran by 11 foot long.
When you're talking what,

1468
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,070
1800 pounds.

1469
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:34,060
So while they're gone on round trip one
disparate already claimed it,

1470
01:04:34,061 --> 01:04:35,950
got scared,
heard them come and then saw,

1471
01:04:35,951 --> 01:04:37,390
oh you're taking my shit.
And it was like,

1472
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:39,310
fuck that.
And came back to the defendant.

1473
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:40,210
Yeah.
So it didn't,

1474
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:43,030
it didn't come by to chase him off.
It came to fight.

1475
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,470
It just didn't know how many there were.
And there was like seven or eight guys I

1476
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:49,480
think at least I think one,
two,

1477
01:04:49,481 --> 01:04:51,370
three.
At least five guys.

1478
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,000
And so I think it just got confused that
there were so many people and didn't

1479
01:04:55,001 --> 01:04:57,370
know where to go or what to do and then
it got hit in the head with a tracking

1480
01:04:57,371 --> 01:05:00,590
sticks and then you know,
fucking bag.

1481
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:05,260
But like one of my friends had,
my friend remy had a pistol just for

1482
01:05:05,261 --> 01:05:06,430
that,
just for bears,

1483
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,790
but he had said is packed down and he
like,

1484
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,960
in his mind he thought,
well if a bear comes I'll be able to get

1485
01:05:10,961 --> 01:05:12,040
to my pack.
Fuck that.

1486
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,480
He's like,
it happens so fast.

1487
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:15,700
There's no getting to your pack.
There's no nothing.

1488
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,680
And these are guys that know what fuck
they're doing.

1489
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:18,850
They're professionals

1490
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,910
with plans in place.
They're out in the woods hundreds of

1491
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:26,910
days a year.
We're so weak were so we're like just

1492
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:32,430
water balloons for a fellow man.
We're just,

1493
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:36,850
we're nothing.
These things are like when you watch

1494
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:39,700
them fight each other and they're biting
each other's faces and shaking each

1495
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:42,340
other back and forth,
and it still doesn't hurt them.

1496
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:43,520
Yeah.
That's,

1497
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,950
we're,
we're so fleshy.

1498
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,810
That's good.
We live here.

1499
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,040
Let's good.
We live in Los Angeles.

1500
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,290
No,
not in the fucking mountains.

1501
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,530
No.
Maryland has a.

1502
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,880
You guys have mountain lions,
right?

1503
01:05:56,210 --> 01:05:59,840
We have mountain lions.
But I saw I went hiking it from in here

1504
01:05:59,841 --> 01:06:03,590
one time.
I hiked it for awhile and I lived in the

1505
01:06:03,591 --> 01:06:05,300
valley.
I hiked there a lot and I would see a

1506
01:06:05,301 --> 01:06:08,150
lot of rattlesnakes.
I was solved a lot of rattle snakes,

1507
01:06:08,151 --> 01:06:10,610
but one night,
I don't know,

1508
01:06:10,611 --> 01:06:13,700
it's probably fall.
It's right around six,

1509
01:06:13,701 --> 01:06:18,380
6:30 and the sun starting to set and I'm
just trying to get through and I've got

1510
01:06:18,381 --> 01:06:21,740
my headphones on.
I'm coming down this hill and this

1511
01:06:21,741 --> 01:06:24,920
fucking bobcat comes off the hill and
it.

1512
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,470
I mean this thing was the size of a big
dog,

1513
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,970
stubby little tail.
It stopped writing.

1514
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:31,680
I mean I was like,
Huh,

1515
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:32,930
you know,
and it just stopped.

1516
01:06:32,931 --> 01:06:34,760
It fucking looked at me and the first

1517
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,150
and only thought that went through my
head because I had nothing.

1518
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:37,881
No,
what do I got to.

1519
01:06:37,881 --> 01:06:39,720
I was like,
maybe I can take my headphones,

1520
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:43,990
choking
a little apple.

1521
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:49,080
And it looked at me like it's your lucky
day in and it ran over the next Ridge

1522
01:06:49,081 --> 01:06:50,490
and was gone and my.
I mean I,

1523
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,800
it's like,
Holy Shit.

1524
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,750
Yeah.
I've seen one of those with its babies.

1525
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:56,020
Yeah,
they're cool looking.

1526
01:06:56,021 --> 01:06:57,690
They're big.
They're bigger than I thought.

1527
01:06:58,110 --> 01:07:00,300
Way bigger than what I thought when I
saw it.

1528
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:01,920
I saw it,
I thought it was a mountain lion.

1529
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:03,270
Yeah.
I was like,

1530
01:07:03,271 --> 01:07:04,260
look at that thing.
And they're like,

1531
01:07:04,261 --> 01:07:04,981
no,
it's a bobcat.

1532
01:07:04,981 --> 01:07:06,090
I was like,
what?

1533
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,950
Oh yeah.
That thing was big,

1534
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:09,240
like 50 pounds.
Yeah.

1535
01:07:09,241 --> 01:07:10,230
I thought,
you know,

1536
01:07:10,231 --> 01:07:12,810
maybe between like a little bigger than
a cat now.

1537
01:07:12,811 --> 01:07:15,450
This thing was like waste.
It was like up to my waist to the fuck

1538
01:07:15,451 --> 01:07:16,051
you out.
I was like,

1539
01:07:16,051 --> 01:07:17,430
I'm dead.
I'm fucking dead.

1540
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,440
Have you ever heard a links?
How?

1541
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:22,950
Only because that's the only reason I've
ever heard it.

1542
01:07:22,951 --> 01:07:23,520
Yeah.
Videos.

1543
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,540
Crazy.
Crazy.

1544
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:24,770
Right?

1545
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:27,500
But they're facing right
now.

1546
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:30,310
Well,
there was one that got into some guy's

1547
01:07:30,311 --> 01:07:33,040
house and the guy made a video of the
thing in his house,

1548
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:34,930
Holland and I was playing it for people
like,

1549
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:36,130
oh,
that's like sound effects,

1550
01:07:36,131 --> 01:07:36,510
right?
I go,

1551
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:36,741
no,
no,

1552
01:07:36,741 --> 01:07:38,130
no.
That's what it's really making this

1553
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:40,420
noise.
It's really making like why it's in his

1554
01:07:40,421 --> 01:07:41,560
kitchen and it's gone.

1555
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,380
Put it up.
This

1556
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:54,883
what

1557
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:02,870
it sounds like.
It sounds like little kids pretending to

1558
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:07,871
be a month
who runs into this.

1559
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:15,230
They get closer to the two.
They don't quite do anything.

1560
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,110
Like neither one of them's

1561
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,110
gangster.
They're both posers.

1562
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:21,260
Ooh.
Headbutts.

1563
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:23,750
And one of them almost swatted and was
like,

1564
01:08:23,751 --> 01:08:24,620
bitch,
don't make maybe slap.

1565
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,680
Slap you.
Yeah.

1566
01:08:27,681 --> 01:08:28,514
That's a big animal.

1567
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:31,300
Links are weird.
That's a weird animal.

1568
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:33,090
Foods kitchen.
Yeah.

1569
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,610
Yeah.
See if you can find the one with the

1570
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:39,670
links is in the kitchen because this
fucking guy standing over it.

1571
01:08:39,671 --> 01:08:41,230
It's only like five feet away from him
and it's like,

1572
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,070
I would say that's a battle cry.

1573
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:45,780
You know,
I'm getting the fuck out of my own

1574
01:08:45,781 --> 01:08:47,970
kitchen or it's sick like this.
Here it is.

1575
01:08:47,971 --> 01:08:48,810
Here it is through this.

1576
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:51,993
No

1577
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:11,470
problem.

1578
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:21,230
We find this guy's phone later covered
in blood playback.

1579
01:09:21,231 --> 01:09:22,250
His last video.

1580
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,470
Exempt.
Scared.

1581
01:09:28,690 --> 01:09:31,430
Like I'm scared of snakes.
My brother gave me a fear of fucking

1582
01:09:31,431 --> 01:09:32,110
snakes.
My.

1583
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:34,400
I have a twin brother.
He's four minutes older than me,

1584
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,740
but we looked nothing like tall and
skinny,

1585
01:09:36,741 --> 01:09:38,240
but I will say,
yeah,

1586
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,560
that's weird.
It's weird,

1587
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:43,470
but there are times when we speak even
now and I'm like,

1588
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,660
oh,
I just hit like it's his voice came out

1589
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:46,381
of me.
It's weird.

1590
01:09:46,381 --> 01:09:47,850
That's the.
That's the weird thing,

1591
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:51,330
but he quit,
he gets hurt and you feel it now.

1592
01:09:51,331 --> 01:09:52,680
I don't feel any.
We used to,

1593
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,920
we used to fuck with like if there was a
girl in high school and I'm like,

1594
01:09:55,921 --> 01:09:58,350
I don't just talk to her.
I want to play video games.

1595
01:09:58,351 --> 01:10:00,210
He would set dates up and shit,
you know,

1596
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,550
like going to the movies,
the ball.

1597
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:02,710
I'm like,
God damn it.

1598
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,250
But uh,
he was Mr outdoors like he wasn't,

1599
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,790
he would play with snakes and he catched
black snakes all the time.

1600
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,770
We'd put them in an aquarium.
We go the,

1601
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:16,920
the pet store and get little feed mice
and you know,

1602
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,200
they won't eat it when it's dead.
Sometimes they'd be dead.

1603
01:10:19,201 --> 01:10:22,380
So my brother would reach in and just
dance the tail and these snakes would

1604
01:10:22,381 --> 01:10:23,820
bite him in the fucking hand and I'll be
like,

1605
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,380
Jesus Christ.
And he wouldn't even.

1606
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,900
He just keep looking at the snake and
rub his handling.

1607
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:32,010
You're fucking nuts dude.
So one day,

1608
01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:34,140
um,
it's my turn to cut the grass,

1609
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,500
right?
We had the same snapper riding mower

1610
01:10:37,501 --> 01:10:38,760
from.
Can't buy me love.

1611
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:41,100
Okay.
That snapper with a bad catcher on the

1612
01:10:41,101 --> 01:10:41,934
back.
Okay.

1613
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,840
I'm in the backyard going around three
doors.

1614
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:48,570
Ups.
Our Buddy Jeff lives there and I see him

1615
01:10:48,571 --> 01:10:51,330
and my brother,
there's a pine tree and I see him with a

1616
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:54,720
broom and they're standing away from it,
but their swat and with a trash can.

1617
01:10:54,721 --> 01:10:55,141
I'm like,
oh,

1618
01:10:55,141 --> 01:10:57,390
they got a big ass,
big ass black snake in there,

1619
01:10:57,391 --> 01:10:59,670
you know,
so I've got my headphones on.

1620
01:10:59,671 --> 01:11:02,750
I'm just going around.
I look up on our deck and my brothers

1621
01:11:02,751 --> 01:11:05,300
stand there holding this fucking snake.
Exactly.

1622
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:06,121
He's going to throw it.
I'm like,

1623
01:11:06,121 --> 01:11:08,550
don't fucking do it then.
Don't fucking do it.

1624
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,850
I got my shirt off.
It's hot as summer.

1625
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:13,620
I'm,
I go back to mine and business.

1626
01:11:13,621 --> 01:11:14,040
I come

1627
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,730
back around a few times later and I just
feel something slapped the back of my

1628
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,600
neck
and I look over,

1629
01:11:21,601 --> 01:11:23,230
this steak is looking at me.
I fuck.

1630
01:11:23,231 --> 01:11:24,960
I said,
I scream like a bitch.

1631
01:11:24,961 --> 01:11:26,580
I grabbed it.
I throw it on the fucking ground.

1632
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:27,391
My brother's like,
don't.

1633
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:30,870
I'll put that blade down,
dump that bag out.

1634
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:32,130
I said,
there's your fucking snake.

1635
01:11:32,131 --> 01:11:35,180
You son of a bitch,
he would do shit like he catch the

1636
01:11:35,181 --> 01:11:36,780
little ones,
I can't remember.

1637
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:40,080
Or they garner gardener snakes.
Maybe guard just a tiny ones.

1638
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,330
I think they're called Gardner,
right?

1639
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:41,900
Yeah.
I,

1640
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,080
I,
I don't remember.

1641
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:45,680
But were garden snakes,
guarder,

1642
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,910
steezy.
Those little slippery guys,

1643
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:49,620
you know.
And we're uh,

1644
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:50,280
my,
my,

1645
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,470
I'll never forget this.
We had a Volkswagen bug.

1646
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:54,780
He and I are sitting in the back.
My little brother's upfront,

1647
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,790
my mom's taking him into the doctor and
she was like,

1648
01:11:56,791 --> 01:11:58,530
you two can stay in the car.
Wait here if you want.

1649
01:11:58,531 --> 01:11:59,030
I'm like,
all right.

1650
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:03,630
We drive them for like 10 minutes.
My brother reaches in his pocket and he

1651
01:12:03,631 --> 01:12:05,340
pulls out one of those snakes.
I'm like,

1652
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,830
what the fuck are you?
How long has that been in there?

1653
01:12:07,831 --> 01:12:08,200
He's like,
oh,

1654
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,270
picked it up.
I'm like,

1655
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:10,920
what is your fucking problem?
Dude?

1656
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:13,500
I was always scared around him with that
shit.

1657
01:12:13,501 --> 01:12:16,830
He would always like,
he thinks he is.

1658
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:17,790
He thinks he's like that

1659
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:21,510
he should go to Florida and try to help
those people out in the everglades.

1660
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,570
You know,
they're hiring people to just shoot at

1661
01:12:24,571 --> 01:12:25,010
them.
Now.

1662
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:26,670
They hired hunters to go names.
Yeah.

1663
01:12:26,671 --> 01:12:30,870
They have so many pythons.
All these crazy dirty white people who

1664
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:33,240
wanted to own a python and the mother's
like,

1665
01:12:33,241 --> 01:12:36,340
you get that thing out of the house.
They just open up the backdoor,

1666
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:40,530
chuck it in the yard and it slithers off
into the swamps of Florida is all filled

1667
01:12:40,531 --> 01:12:42,930
with swamps and the pythons thrive
there.

1668
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,500
Come on.
I didn't know that it.

1669
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:44,860
No,
no,

1670
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:45,661
no,
dude,

1671
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:48,210
there's a giant problem with python
because of man.

1672
01:12:48,211 --> 01:12:50,610
Again,
we get this easy money not for python

1673
01:12:50,611 --> 01:12:53,880
hunters who grappled with everglades
giants for $8 and ten cents an hour.

1674
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:58,500
Fucking they're so big dude.
They found one of them that had eaten an

1675
01:12:58,501 --> 01:13:01,560
alligator and the alligator was popping
out of his body.

1676
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,930
They were both dead.
They were both dead,

1677
01:13:03,931 --> 01:13:07,320
floating in the water,
but this fucking eight foot alligator

1678
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:11,160
was inside this pythons body.
Jesus Christ.

1679
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:16,140
Look at this one,
144 pound reptile up on a levy.

1680
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:19,470
They dispatched it with a nine
millimeter pistol shot to the head.

1681
01:13:19,471 --> 01:13:21,690
Inside.
They found 70 or 80 eggs.

1682
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,720
See their fucking.
There's a plague of um,

1683
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:26,790
the everglades.
There's so many layers.

1684
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,270
It says it.
Yeah.

1685
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,590
More than 800 caught this year,
this year,

1686
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:35,070
six months into the year.
And what may be the most successful

1687
01:13:35,071 --> 01:13:38,370
program ever aimed at this huge
constrictors that are killing the

1688
01:13:38,371 --> 01:13:39,510
everglades.
Mammals.

1689
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:42,390
Wading birds and alligators and
alligators.

1690
01:13:42,391 --> 01:13:44,730
Motherfucker.
Alligator.

1691
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,620
Yeah.
They have python catching contest.

1692
01:13:46,621 --> 01:13:48,810
They track them with dogs.
They're doing everything they can,

1693
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,560
but the,
um,

1694
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,050
you know,
they're not putting a dent in them.

1695
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:53,550
There's so many of them out there.
Man.

1696
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:54,460
I used to the

1697
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:58,060
watch the gator one word.
They chewed them and oh yeah,

1698
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:02,840
swamp people on people because at first
they were extinct and then they dialed

1699
01:14:02,841 --> 01:14:04,100
that back now like,
oh fuck,

1700
01:14:04,101 --> 01:14:06,050
now they're overrunning shit.
Go and get them.

1701
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,140
Well,
I used to live in Florida when they were

1702
01:14:09,141 --> 01:14:10,990
going extinct.
What does this one dear?

1703
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,300
It was a deer that was inside.

1704
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:15,430
Look at what?
Look at the size of the idea.

1705
01:14:15,431 --> 01:14:20,330
That's a big deer and it's inside this
python a

1706
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:25,600
Jesus Christ.
That's funny.

1707
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:29,680
We have people who don't have jobs,
who have day jobs,

1708
01:14:29,681 --> 01:14:31,840
people have night jobs,
some people have computer jobs,

1709
01:14:31,841 --> 01:14:34,090
technical jobs,
and they're all hunters,

1710
01:14:34,091 --> 01:14:36,070
herpetologists,
military veterans.

1711
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,470
All these people are doing this,
going into the everglades,

1712
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:43,330
trying to solve this problem.
They're saying adventure and a desire to

1713
01:14:43,331 --> 01:14:48,331
defend the everglades.
What thrills me is the fight,

1714
01:14:48,641 --> 01:14:53,641
the fight that the snake gives you that
maybe one day you won't when you're

1715
01:14:54,341 --> 01:14:56,650
definitely,
you're not going to bat a thousand at

1716
01:14:56,651 --> 01:14:57,431
that job.
I mean,

1717
01:14:57,431 --> 01:14:59,440
they're capable of killing people for
sure.

1718
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:01,460
When they get that big where they can
swallow a deer.

1719
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,890
I mean a deer's hunger.
That's a small deer.

1720
01:15:03,891 --> 01:15:06,540
I mean,
it's not big like a giant mule deer.

1721
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:07,900
Anything like if you have that one that
they caught,

1722
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:08,890
what in the.
I mean that's

1723
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:12,460
five grown men a good distance apart and
there's still some

1724
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,510
bows in that thing.
It's 130,

1725
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:17,300
two pounds,
17 feet long.

1726
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:21,280
Wow.
Jesus Christ.

1727
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:23,820
That is a big fucking animals.
That is.

1728
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:28,090
This is all just from assholes.
Assholes.

1729
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,430
Just chucking them into the woods and
Glulam.

1730
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,730
I'm done with it.
The thing bit me in the hand,

1731
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,480
can't.
My mouth is open.

1732
01:15:34,481 --> 01:15:37,360
I can't get over that.
That is now a plague because of that.

1733
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:39,760
Oh yeah.
I mean if you think they killed 800 of

1734
01:15:39,761 --> 01:15:41,800
them this year and they're not even
putting a dent.

1735
01:15:41,801 --> 01:15:43,120
Right?
How many are out there?

1736
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:45,850
God Damn.
Yeah.

1737
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:49,990
You know what else they found out?
Their Nile crocodiles there was shoot to

1738
01:15:49,991 --> 01:15:54,991
kill order on Nile crocodiles.
So some ass fuck Dick Wad let Nile

1739
01:15:55,271 --> 01:15:59,950
crocodiles loose and they think there
might be breeding populations of Nile

1740
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:02,210
crocodiles,
those 28 years old,

1741
01:16:02,211 --> 01:16:07,211
the monsters heat willdabeast
with teeth like the size of our hands.

1742
01:16:07,511 --> 01:16:12,511
And two days ago this guy was doing a
baptist baptism and uh,

1743
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:17,560
this dude in Ethiopia and as he's in the
middle of doing the baptism of fucking

1744
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:21,040
crocodile lunges up out of the water and
snatches him in front of his whole

1745
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:25,540
congregation and brought him under
crocodile jumps from Ethiopian Lake

1746
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:26,710
Hills pastor during mass.

1747
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:31,770
Pat,
God's got plans for me children.

1748
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:32,920
Yeah,
no shit.

1749
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:36,363
Fuck man.

1750
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,490
Man.
I,

1751
01:16:38,491 --> 01:16:40,510
um,
I worked in a junk yard growing up.

1752
01:16:40,511 --> 01:16:43,090
My friend's dad had a junk yard out in
Mount Airy,

1753
01:16:43,091 --> 01:16:45,360
was called Mount airy auto wrecking.
And um,

1754
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,550
there was one day where,
uh,

1755
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,350
so we,
we would have our own yard car.

1756
01:16:50,351 --> 01:16:53,490
We're driving where we,
we were in charge were younger kids,

1757
01:16:53,491 --> 01:16:54,100
so he would,
blake,

1758
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:57,610
you're going to go get all the aluminum,
you're going to basically clean up the

1759
01:16:57,611 --> 01:16:59,370
junk yard of all the loose aluminum.
We're gonna,

1760
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:01,050
put it in,
these bins will melt it down.

1761
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:04,720
Then they sell it off in like these
little trays,

1762
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:06,910
you know.
And one day I hear this,

1763
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:10,040
we had a bunch of feral cats but we
didn't any dogs.

1764
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,210
And one day I hear this fucking like
growling or is her,

1765
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:17,540
her and I look over and there's a
fucking rabid raccoon.

1766
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:22,930
It had one solid white I one solid blue
eye and it's bouncing just up and down.

1767
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,680
It's not charging us.
And we're like,

1768
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:27,560
what the fuck?
We start throwing rocks and shit,

1769
01:17:27,561 --> 01:17:28,400
add it.
And then we're like,

1770
01:17:28,401 --> 01:17:31,580
maybe it's protecting babies.
We don't know what the fuck this thing's

1771
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:34,970
due.
And so we go down to tell his dad and

1772
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:37,280
his customers down there,
this is out in the country,

1773
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:40,160
is customers down and he's like,
I got a pistol in my fucking car.

1774
01:17:40,161 --> 01:17:44,870
He brings this thing up to,
to the Dome to put it down to two.

1775
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,730
Took one to the head and it.
And it just was like

1776
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:50,890
laying down ground to,
to put this rabid,

1777
01:17:50,891 --> 01:17:52,370
raccoon,
rabid.

1778
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:53,320
It was test.
Definitely,

1779
01:17:53,321 --> 01:17:54,360
yes.
Definitely read to.

1780
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:58,420
Had to have the whatever animal control
come out and take it away and shit.

1781
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,850
What does rabies coming from?
Like there has to be like.

1782
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,280
I always thought that about VD who's
patient?

1783
01:18:03,281 --> 01:18:06,310
Zero dirty motherfuckers out there
giving.

1784
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:11,340
Everybody said
what did you have to do to get gonorrhea

1785
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:16,630
was the first person to go because it's
crazy that there's diseases that kill

1786
01:18:16,631 --> 01:18:18,250
people.
Like Al Capone.

1787
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:22,690
He got killed by syphilis.
Killed by some shit that you get from

1788
01:18:22,691 --> 01:18:23,524
fucking.
Yeah,

1789
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:26,060
let them eat him alive.
They let them do what they did.

1790
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,490
That's what I've read before.
Like they couldn't get them on anything.

1791
01:18:28,491 --> 01:18:31,940
So they got him on tax evasion and then
when he developed syphilis they didn't

1792
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:33,330
treat it.
Oh really?

1793
01:18:33,331 --> 01:18:34,550
Yeah.
And then he lost his mind.

1794
01:18:34,551 --> 01:18:34,730
You

1795
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:39,030
just ate his brain away like crazy g's
home,

1796
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:40,760
bro.
Did you know that syphilis was the

1797
01:18:40,761 --> 01:18:43,850
reason why all those dudes in the olden
days had powdered wigs?

1798
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:45,690
No.
Yeah,

1799
01:18:45,691 --> 01:18:46,221
man,
man,

1800
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:49,870
I should come here for my education.
God Damn Goofy as education.

1801
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:52,740
You miss out a lot of critical shit.
Like

1802
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:57,730
I repeat it all the time.
We've.

1803
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:00,620
We've covered this several times,
so I'll just be really brief.

1804
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:03,950
There was a these royals from,
was it France?

1805
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,770
Something like that.
Jamie will come to the store,

1806
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:10,220
but they got syphilis and to cover their
syphilis,

1807
01:19:10,221 --> 01:19:14,570
they started wearing wigs and syphilis
was running rampant through this.

1808
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:16,910
So all these rich people started wearing
wigs.

1809
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:18,830
So these big ass wigs.
Can I ask you,

1810
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:22,610
what was it eating their skin like?
Was it like a psoriasis and shit?

1811
01:19:22,611 --> 01:19:23,860
They use noticeable.
Yeah.

1812
01:19:23,861 --> 01:19:26,630
The hair falls out,
falls out a big patchy.

1813
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:30,300
The reason they did it,
I thought it was all to be majestic and

1814
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,800
became that.
It became that and the bigger the wig

1815
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,450
though,
the more money you had,

1816
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:37,670
like if you had a lot of money,
you get a big crazy wait.

1817
01:19:37,671 --> 01:19:40,060
That's why we call like rich people,
bigwigs.

1818
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:45,500
Why do people wear powdered wigs like
those guys?

1819
01:19:45,501 --> 01:19:48,080
And it all came out of these two,
two brothers,

1820
01:19:48,081 --> 01:19:50,840
I think they were serious for nearly two
centuries.

1821
01:19:50,841 --> 01:19:55,841
Powdered wigs called parex were all the
rage that cheek chic hairpieces would

1822
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:58,610
have become pop,
wouldn't,

1823
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:01,250
would have never become popular.
However,

1824
01:20:01,251 --> 01:20:03,140
if it hadn't been for a venereal
disease,

1825
01:20:03,141 --> 01:20:06,320
a pair of self conscious kings and poor
hair hygiene,

1826
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:09,030
the proof begins like many others with
syphilis,

1827
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,730
by 1580,
the std had become one of the worst

1828
01:20:11,731 --> 01:20:14,600
epidemic is tried.
Eastern Europe was strike Europe rather

1829
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:16,950
since the black plague.
And according to William,

1830
01:20:16,951 --> 01:20:19,590
close,
an infinite multitude of syphilis.

1831
01:20:19,591 --> 01:20:24,450
Patients Clog London hospitals and more
filtered each day without antibiotics.

1832
01:20:24,451 --> 01:20:26,580
Victim face the full brunt of the
disease,

1833
01:20:26,581 --> 01:20:28,470
open sores,
nasty rashes,

1834
01:20:28,471 --> 01:20:30,810
blindness,
dementia and patchy hair loss.

1835
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:34,320
Baldness swept the land.
And so,

1836
01:20:34,321 --> 01:20:38,170
um,
these dudes Louis the 14th,

1837
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:40,590
it was only 17 when his mom started
thinning,

1838
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,690
worried about baldus would hurt his
reputation.

1839
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,480
Louis hired 48 wig makers to save as
image.

1840
01:20:45,481 --> 01:20:47,010
Five years later,
the King of England,

1841
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:49,710
Louise,
cousin Charles the second did the same

1842
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:53,340
thing when his hair started to go gray.
Both men likely had syphilis.

1843
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:55,620
Cordy Aes.
Is that how you say that,

1844
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,430
cody?
I would go with that.

1845
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:00,150
And other aristocrats immediately copied
the two kings.

1846
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:03,930
They supported wigs and the style
trickled down to the upper middle class.

1847
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,870
Your Europe's newest fad was born.
And that crazy.

1848
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:08,430
It is.
See where it says there,

1849
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:09,520
the,
the,

1850
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:14,520
the bill for large elaborate Peru
balloon to as high as 800 shillings.

1851
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:20,480
That turn the word big wig was coined to
describe snobs who could afford big,

1852
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,260
poofy Perutz.
So the average was 25 and they're paying

1853
01:21:25,261 --> 01:21:26,490
upwards of 800.
Yeah.

1854
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,920
Look at these dudes.
They had like crazy wigs,

1855
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:30,660
like who?
Those wigs shit.

1856
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,370
All because of an STD.
Yeah.

1857
01:21:32,371 --> 01:21:35,700
They all were bald with fucking sores
and shit everywhere.

1858
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:38,670
It looks like one on his feet flat on
his face.

1859
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:44,060
Probably got a hole in his face.
Losing his teeth still still fucking was

1860
01:21:45,411 --> 01:21:48,150
still fogging up.
Semi getting a semi hard.

1861
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:50,640
They're shooting.
They're poisoning into people

1862
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:53,110
on an education here.
Oh,

1863
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:58,470
imagined life before antibiotics.
I can't imagine life before like the

1864
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:03,190
eighties.
People did shit.

1865
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:05,920
Like when we were having a baby,
I thought about like,

1866
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:07,960
how do people do this in the covered
wagon?

1867
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:09,610
Like just going there.
Yeah.

1868
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:12,400
They still do in bathtubs,
these assholes and rice fields.

1869
01:22:12,401 --> 01:22:15,070
I was reading these things about these
ladies that'll go out and rice field and

1870
01:22:15,071 --> 01:22:18,520
stand in the hold and they'll drop it
into the water.

1871
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:22,240
I don't know if it goes in water,
but they just natural and squat and then

1872
01:22:22,241 --> 01:22:26,200
they'll just have it and have someone
there to catch it and fuck.

1873
01:22:26,201 --> 01:22:27,160
I was like,
Nah.

1874
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:30,550
I think in Baltimore and mercy it's
called Mercy Hospital.

1875
01:22:30,551 --> 01:22:33,430
They were the first,
I'm pretty sure they pioneered the

1876
01:22:33,431 --> 01:22:36,160
underwater birth.
Like you can go get in a tub there,

1877
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:38,650
a big tub,
and then they say,

1878
01:22:38,651 --> 01:22:41,050
I guess that's the most natural way to
have a baby.

1879
01:22:41,051 --> 01:22:43,900
I guess it makes sense if you're in a
placenta and you're just basically

1880
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:47,770
transferring into another one before you
come out instead of just boom out.

1881
01:22:47,771 --> 01:22:49,870
But they say it's.
I don't know how it's natural.

1882
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:53,560
I mean how can it be natural waters not
attached to it either.

1883
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,413
What?
Breathe?

1884
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:57,430
Well,
I think I don't know that quick and

1885
01:22:57,431 --> 01:22:59,670
bring it up.
Yeah,

1886
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:03,160
and it's in like a tank and you sit.
She sits in there and then they just

1887
01:23:03,161 --> 01:23:06,070
deliver it in this big,
big water tank.

1888
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:08,380
Like how's it kid breathing when they're
in the womb?

1889
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,810
I don't,
I never thought about that.

1890
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:14,220
Have literally never thought about that.
I know they're attached to the umbilical

1891
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:15,970
cord.
Biblical cord.

1892
01:23:15,971 --> 01:23:17,200
They're in,
they're there.

1893
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:19,030
They're all curled up in a fetal
position.

1894
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:20,530
How they get in,
they're like,

1895
01:23:20,531 --> 01:23:22,580
what's it going through the court?
I,

1896
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,620
I mean I think all life comes to the
issue.

1897
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:27,940
The court.
So do they not have to breathe while

1898
01:23:27,941 --> 01:23:30,520
they're still attached to the court?
How does that work?

1899
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:32,780
Here it goes.
The fetus is not actually breathing

1900
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:37,830
will.
Mother breeds for the fetus and

1901
01:23:37,871 --> 01:23:42,190
essential oxygen is passed to the fetus
through the umbilical cord to the fetus

1902
01:23:42,191 --> 01:23:44,080
does not make breathing like movements,
though.

1903
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:49,090
These began at nine weeks of pregnancy
and allow the fetus to practice this

1904
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:51,400
breathing movement movement.
Fuck man,

1905
01:23:53,330 --> 01:23:54,760
that is just.
You know what's really weird?

1906
01:23:54,761 --> 01:23:56,110
You take a baby,
you chuck them in the water.

1907
01:23:56,111 --> 01:23:58,210
They immediately hold their breath.
They know exactly what to do,

1908
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,610
but monkeys don't throw a monkey in the
water.

1909
01:24:00,611 --> 01:24:03,160
They fucking panic and start breathing
water and they die.

1910
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,020
Really?
Chimps to now kick.

1911
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:06,610
I can't get over the education.

1912
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:12,190
We tell it to everybody.
All you know chinchillas drown in the

1913
01:24:12,191 --> 01:24:14,410
water.
You know Joe Rogan?

1914
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,910
I did 100 of them.
They all ground 100 rounds.

1915
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,920
This must have a peer review.
Yeah.

1916
01:24:20,921 --> 01:24:23,890
There's something about people like,
we know how to hold our breath even when

1917
01:24:23,891 --> 01:24:25,620
we're babies.
If someone takes a look like that

1918
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:28,060
nirvana picture,
remember that baby?

1919
01:24:28,061 --> 01:24:31,030
That was a real baby swimming,
like kids love it as long as you do it

1920
01:24:31,031 --> 01:24:33,070
to them on an early age and you're there
to catch them,

1921
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:33,881
oh,
this is horrible.

1922
01:24:33,881 --> 01:24:36,040
Don't watch this.
Don't show me this.

1923
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:38,620
I don't want to see this fucking
baptism.

1924
01:24:38,621 --> 01:24:43,621
That slamming this baby into the water.
What races that were Greek Orthodox.

1925
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:45,670
Yeah.
Fuck that.

1926
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:49,260
That's crazy shit of what somebody said.
I think Sarah sent me that.

1927
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:50,170
Like,
what is that?

1928
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:54,640
Or babies in a pool and that popped up.
Let's end all this baby stuff.

1929
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:57,040
That's how the horrible thing that they
do.

1930
01:24:57,041 --> 01:25:00,550
They smash that kid into the water and
pick them up by their arms and smash

1931
01:25:00,551 --> 01:25:03,850
them down in the water again and they do
it a bunch of times and then they cut

1932
01:25:03,851 --> 01:25:05,340
his dick.
Yeah.

1933
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:07,150
Dick don't look pretty bro.
Nope.

1934
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:10,610
Cut it up bro.
One day old Dick up,

1935
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:11,640
man.
Slice,

1936
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:14,410
slice and dice.
I was glad I didn't have a boy because

1937
01:25:14,411 --> 01:25:15,244
I,
I,

1938
01:25:15,790 --> 01:25:16,900
you have.
You have two girls.

1939
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:18,010
All girls.
All girls.

1940
01:25:18,011 --> 01:25:19,090
Three girls.
Three girls.

1941
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:20,680
If you had a boy,
what'd you get?

1942
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:22,420
Circumcised?
See I,

1943
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:24,630
I was glad I didn't have to make the
decision.

1944
01:25:24,631 --> 01:25:28,090
Yes,
stick me Catholic.

1945
01:25:28,091 --> 01:25:29,080
I am,
but I was like,

1946
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:29,943
what?
I do that.

1947
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,110
No way,
dude.

1948
01:25:32,111 --> 01:25:35,050
Sometimes they lose their Dick.
Sometimes it gets infected.

1949
01:25:35,051 --> 01:25:38,230
It happens every year,
every year to shot a little

1950
01:25:38,231 --> 01:25:39,590
circumcision.
Jobs year,

1951
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:44,680
kids get infections from circumcisions
and they lose their Dick every year.

1952
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,910
Also,
kids,

1953
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:49,690
this has happened multiple times.
Kids have been circumcised by a

1954
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:50,770
traditional,
you know,

1955
01:25:50,771 --> 01:25:54,640
what is it?
Oil with the rabbi and the rabbi's had

1956
01:25:54,641 --> 01:25:58,210
herpes and they've transferred it
because the rabbi has to suck the kids.

1957
01:25:58,211 --> 01:26:00,160
Dick stop the bleeding.
Yes.

1958
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:01,570
They still do that.
Yes.

1959
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:03,490
Yes.
They still do that and they still defend

1960
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:06,170
it.
It's a traditional way of doing it and

1961
01:26:06,171 --> 01:26:07,370
you're giving it.
Herpes.

1962
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:11,960
People have given the baby's herpes and
the kids have died from it.

1963
01:26:11,961 --> 01:26:14,420
She says,
yeah,

1964
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:17,270
they've died from it.
Yeah,

1965
01:26:17,271 --> 01:26:20,330
I didn't know that.
Still gone down to they suck the baby

1966
01:26:20,331 --> 01:26:25,250
penis and there's a fucking video of
this one rabbi explaining the necessity

1967
01:26:25,251 --> 01:26:28,040
of doing this because it's the part of
the ancient book.

1968
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:29,300
It's in the Torah,
wherever it is.

1969
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:34,250
Robert Baker estimates 229 deaths per
year from circumcision in the United

1970
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:36,550
States.
Ballinger estimates that approximately

1971
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:41,560
119 infant boys die from circumcision
related each year in the U.

1972
01:26:42,061 --> 01:26:47,061
s one point three percent of all male
neonatal deaths from all causes are from

1973
01:26:48,801 --> 01:26:49,970
circumcision.

1974
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:55,130
These are several cases.
There are several case reports of death

1975
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,820
in the medical literature.
Yeah,

1976
01:26:58,090 --> 01:27:01,710
people die all the time from
circumcision or just understand that

1977
01:27:01,711 --> 01:27:05,460
folks,
this is an elected unnecessary surgery

1978
01:27:05,461 --> 01:27:09,600
that you're doing to a fucking baby and
there's no medical reason to do it,

1979
01:27:09,601 --> 01:27:10,690
but oh well.
Hey,

1980
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:13,590
it's prevents people say stupid shit
like that.

1981
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:14,790
It does.
No,

1982
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:17,040
it does.
It doesn't make any sense.

1983
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:19,830
There's a lot of people that are doing
it to justify the fact they've done it

1984
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:21,720
forever and try to come up with wool
hygiene.

1985
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:24,690
Wash your Dick,
you dirty bitch soap and water.

1986
01:27:24,691 --> 01:27:27,870
Wash your Dick.
I watched a guy at the gym one time as

1987
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:31,290
the old Dube stood underneath.
You know the hand dryers?

1988
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:31,950
What?
His balls?

1989
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:34,560
Yeah,
he rolled his circumcised dick down to

1990
01:27:34,561 --> 01:27:37,400
dry.
I've never used that edge right here to

1991
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:38,070
get out.

1992
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:40,980
There's a fucking there move,
Dude.

1993
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:42,160
That's it.
Dude.

1994
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,250
Doesn't have any shame.
Well,

1995
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:47,100
I don't know if those numbers are
accurate that you just read or that we

1996
01:27:47,101 --> 01:27:50,090
just pulled up on another article
talking about it and this is an

1997
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:55,100
Australian link to talk about the same
information that says that by or

1998
01:27:55,890 --> 01:27:59,940
according to this study that not all
deaths that might be circumstantial,

1999
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:02,880
unrelated are officially recorded.
Oh,

2000
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:04,740
there might be more.
So they hide it.

2001
01:28:04,741 --> 01:28:07,530
I guess they call it something else.
They say it's an infection or something

2002
01:28:07,531 --> 01:28:08,364
like that.
I mean,

2003
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:10,230
man,
it's unnecessary.

2004
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:13,490
It's barbaric.
They're going to look back on this 100

2005
01:28:13,491 --> 01:28:15,080
years,
500 years from now and they're gonna

2006
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,240
make fun of it the same way.
We make fun of powder wigs,

2007
01:28:17,241 --> 01:28:19,310
but it's even worse because you do want
it to babies,

2008
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:20,270
you know,
babies can eat,

2009
01:28:20,271 --> 01:28:22,470
didn't have any of you say by the time
they're adults.

2010
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:23,420
They're like,
what happened to my Dick?

2011
01:28:23,421 --> 01:28:25,910
Exactly.
Like we just thought it was ugly.

2012
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:28,070
We had you cut.
Cut.

2013
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,260
Yeah,
I mean I would.

2014
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,220
You should.
I mean,

2015
01:28:31,221 --> 01:28:33,110
you shouldn't be,
that's a decision a person should be

2016
01:28:33,111 --> 01:28:36,350
able to make because I feel like every
guy at the age where they were old

2017
01:28:36,351 --> 01:28:37,630
enough to make that would be like,
fuck,

2018
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:39,350
I'm not doing that.
I'm not doing that.

2019
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:43,040
Do you just know that some guys are
trying to grow their circumstance?

2020
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:45,850
Their forced back?
Yeah.

2021
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:48,560
This is what they're doing.
They're taking the skin that they have

2022
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:52,220
the regular skin around their dick and
they're stretching it out and there's

2023
01:28:52,221 --> 01:28:55,210
all these devices like the lip poll and
the poll shit.

2024
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:58,960
They're trying to get it to go back so
they've taken like the base of their,

2025
01:28:58,961 --> 01:29:03,130
their Dick where it was cut and that
pulling skin up a little bit every day.

2026
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:09,420
I'm not kidding that this like devices
that they have,

2027
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:18,380
you pull your pants pull before
so they believe by when they can really

2028
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,910
pull it.
It'll reattach and grow.

2029
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:24,511
Will.
It looks weird.

2030
01:29:24,511 --> 01:29:27,180
It looks like a turtle neck.
I'd never really looked like.

2031
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,220
You know,
it's not a single layer of skin.

2032
01:29:29,221 --> 01:29:31,600
At the top you've got a double layer.
Now it's gotTa.

2033
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:34,620
You gotta rolled layer.
You do have skin at the top,

2034
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:36,070
but it's like,
you know,

2035
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,370
fucking.
It's like a blanket.

2036
01:29:38,810 --> 01:29:40,470
It's not like a sheet.
Right,

2037
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,260
right.
I can't get.

2038
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:45,760
I can't get over people doing,
I guess people do every day.

2039
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:48,090
Why am I.
So there's a whole community of people

2040
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:49,410
that are trying to grow their force,
came back,

2041
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:54,440
they're really angry and they feel all
this pain and emotional pain from the

2042
01:29:55,741 --> 01:29:58,170
fact they cut their dick cut when
they're a little baby and they had no

2043
01:29:58,171 --> 01:30:02,280
say in it and apparently it makes your
Dick Dick less sensitive when you do

2044
01:30:02,281 --> 01:30:06,300
that and your Dick is naturally self
lubricating the head of your Dick is,

2045
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:10,520
and as soon as they cut the skin off,
then it dries out and you know,

2046
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:11,600
we're used to dry dick.

2047
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:12,690
I was like,
alright,

2048
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:16,740
I got plenty of that.
But apparently regular discs,

2049
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,810
if you don't cut them,
they're moist.

2050
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:22,320
The tip like you pull that force came
back and that tip has got like a layer

2051
01:30:22,321 --> 01:30:25,370
of mucus on which is why you got to
clean it and cut it off.

2052
01:30:27,450 --> 01:30:29,830
Jesus Christ.
That was man.

2053
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:31,460
Yeah,
it's a weird practice,

2054
01:30:31,461 --> 01:30:32,294
man,
and it's.

2055
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,600
It doesn't make any sense.
The fact that it's still around in this

2056
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,930
day and age with all that we know and
all the risks that we know about where

2057
01:30:39,931 --> 01:30:42,390
kids actually do get sick and die from
it.

2058
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,970
That's a real thing.
It happens every year.

2059
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:49,200
Who knows how many people are out there
that have fucked up dicks that had just

2060
01:30:49,201 --> 01:30:53,990
because some asshole,
ancient tradition that we passed on.

2061
01:30:53,991 --> 01:30:55,410
You're just supposed to do it.
Yeah.

2062
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,420
Yeah.
My friend did it to his kid.

2063
01:30:57,421 --> 01:30:58,560
He goes,
I don't want my kid to have a weird

2064
01:30:58,561 --> 01:31:00,030
looking dick.
Like,

2065
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:03,550
what are you talking about?
New going to be looking at how are you

2066
01:31:03,551 --> 01:31:05,400
going to.
How are you trained that kid?

2067
01:31:05,401 --> 01:31:07,280
Do you really think that that's going to
fuck with them?

2068
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:07,740
Like,
yeah,

2069
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:09,750
he goes to the locker room and all the
kid's gonna Stare at his Dick.

2070
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:10,583
I go,
what?

2071
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:13,410
I've been in locker rooms,
a piece of shit.

2072
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:14,830
Nobody cares.
Nobody.

2073
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:17,850
Joey Diaz,
he calls his dick the Cuban egg roll.

2074
01:31:17,851 --> 01:31:20,100
He wasn't,
he wasn't circumcised.

2075
01:31:20,370 --> 01:31:23,730
I've seen dss,
Dick East at least a hundred times,

2076
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:28,970
at least a hundred times and pull out a
stick for punchlines of jokes and um,

2077
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:29,910
uh,
you know,

2078
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:31,600
we're hanging around the parking lot or
something like that.

2079
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:33,960
I've got pictures of him with his pants
down,

2080
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:37,200
like carrying somebody on his shoulders
and his pants are down.

2081
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:38,610
It doesn't have any underwear on.
And he says,

2082
01:31:38,611 --> 01:31:39,720
Dick,
he's so crazy.

2083
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,140
But nobody was going hanging out with
you.

2084
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:46,110
Hook for skin.
How come you didn't get cut,

2085
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:46,810
right?
Yeah.

2086
01:31:46,810 --> 01:31:48,220
Like what kind of kids?
You know,

2087
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:51,120
what kind of kids you're bringing your
kids around where they,

2088
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:53,670
they're going to tease him.
We can't kid can't take a little

2089
01:31:53,671 --> 01:31:54,570
teasing.
Yeah.

2090
01:31:54,571 --> 01:31:55,410
Hey,
I'm sorry.

2091
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:58,350
My dictate and get mutilated by the
witch doctor.

2092
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,530
That's the fucking.
Yeah,

2093
01:31:59,531 --> 01:32:00,250
exactly.

2094
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,500
Exactly.
Your Butcher Dick over there.

2095
01:32:02,501 --> 01:32:04,210
And this shit's fucking intact right
here.

2096
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:06,920
What did it feel like when that oil was
sucking on your deck?

2097
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:08,530
Yeah,
that's when you were two days old.

2098
01:32:08,531 --> 01:32:11,320
That's the,
that's the thing I didn't know was still

2099
01:32:11,321 --> 01:32:12,190
going on.
Now obviously,

2100
01:32:12,191 --> 01:32:15,040
do they circumcised babies still,
but I didn't know that.

2101
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:18,250
Do they defend it and said it's an
Orthodox Jew tradition.

2102
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:20,000
I wonder if he got his dick.
So when couldn't use

2103
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:22,850
because it was hard.

2104
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:24,840
They were keeping the game.
Yeah.

2105
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:26,290
Alright.
Was deep in the game.

2106
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:29,320
Are already went to Israel and lived on
it.

2107
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:30,760
What is it,
a blitz or something like that.

2108
01:32:30,761 --> 01:32:33,970
One of those things.
He was in one of those colonies where

2109
01:32:33,971 --> 01:32:34,451
you're,
you know,

2110
01:32:34,451 --> 01:32:37,270
you're reading the Torah like fucking 10
hours a day

2111
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:39,630
deep.
And he talked to me about that.

2112
01:32:39,631 --> 01:32:42,720
And you and it's a funded trip.
You pay nothing to go do that.

2113
01:32:42,721 --> 01:32:44,130
It's your um,
said,

2114
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:47,790
I'm probably saying it,
but is it not right of passage or maybe

2115
01:32:47,791 --> 01:32:48,541
it is.
I don't know.

2116
01:32:48,541 --> 01:32:52,200
It's uh,
something that's paid for if you want to

2117
01:32:52,201 --> 01:32:53,850
go.
And he was telling us how he went there.

2118
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:56,340
Yeah.
He's a fascinating guy because he went

2119
01:32:56,370 --> 01:33:01,370
the other way like they did and they got
him over there and after like he just

2120
01:33:02,161 --> 01:33:03,240
experienced it all.
I was like,

2121
01:33:03,241 --> 01:33:04,440
okay,
this is all horseshit.

2122
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:06,030
Sure.

2123
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:10,690
It was crazy braids.
Yeah.

2124
01:33:10,691 --> 01:33:12,700
He had all that stuff.
You had the crazy braids.

2125
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:14,430
He went to Kennis and route.
Yeah.

2126
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:17,100
But yeah,
without the head injury,

2127
01:33:18,170 --> 01:33:20,500
no kid isn't.
All that shit came from digital that,

2128
01:33:20,501 --> 01:33:22,750
that all came from a head injury.
Are you serious?

2129
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:27,390
Kinisons book?
My brother bill or um,

2130
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:29,160
my brother Sam,
um,

2131
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:34,020
his brother Bill wrote a book about him
and he said that Sam was one way and it

2132
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:35,280
like a normal kid,
like,

2133
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:36,300
you know,
calm,

2134
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:39,980
regular kid and he got hit by a car and
when he got hit by a car he was like,

2135
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:44,700
like seriously injured bad head injury.
And then out of that he was a wild

2136
01:33:44,701 --> 01:33:45,530
motherfucker.

2137
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:46,550
Oh,
it all changed.

2138
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:49,280
That happens.
People head injuries.

2139
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:50,180
I,
um,

2140
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:53,360
I had a good friend of mine,
she passed away when she was 16 and I

2141
01:33:53,361 --> 01:33:55,760
was talking to the doctor at the time.
I'll never forget,

2142
01:33:55,761 --> 01:33:59,870
he said this about the soul and you knew
we were just having this conversation.

2143
01:33:59,871 --> 01:34:01,700
He said,
I believe the souls in the brain.

2144
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:02,601
And I said,
why?

2145
01:34:02,601 --> 01:34:03,041
And he goes,
why?

2146
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:06,800
Everyone associates the soul with the
chest and the heart and the soul and the

2147
01:34:06,801 --> 01:34:07,551
heart and soul.
And he said,

2148
01:34:07,551 --> 01:34:12,020
but I can literally replace anything in
your body and you're still Joe Rogan,

2149
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:15,500
but the moment,
the moment I even tweak your brain,

2150
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:18,170
you can become a different Joe Rogan.
And he's like,

2151
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,480
that's why I believe the true soul is in
the brain.

2152
01:34:20,481 --> 01:34:22,280
I was like,
that's really fucking interesting

2153
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:26,300
because you can't manipulate a brain and
still,

2154
01:34:26,450 --> 01:34:29,690
well maybe you can,
but you start changing even a little

2155
01:34:29,691 --> 01:34:32,200
thing on a brain and it can be like you
just said,

2156
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:34,430
become a wild man from that.
Or the other way.

2157
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:38,250
You remember when you were a kid,
they had tvs that weren't that good back

2158
01:34:38,251 --> 01:34:42,760
then in like the TV didn't work good and
you'd fucking smacked that bitch.

2159
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:44,870
It would work.

2160
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:49,240
There
was something with people.

2161
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:54,220
Some people you just fucking rattle
their cage and they become a different

2162
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:56,890
thing and it works better,
but it's like a very inexact,

2163
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:59,810
like people had gotten hit in the head
and all of a sudden been able to play

2164
01:34:59,811 --> 01:35:01,790
music and got really good at math.

2165
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:02,880
Yeah.
That's amazing.

2166
01:35:02,881 --> 01:35:06,480
So Gora talks about that on his special
with a head injury and comes back with,

2167
01:35:07,650 --> 01:35:09,690
Oh man,
is it tourette's or something?

2168
01:35:09,691 --> 01:35:12,180
They come back different yet accent.
That's what it was.

2169
01:35:12,181 --> 01:35:14,480
An accident or sudden accident.
Yeah,

2170
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,290
right.
That's really cool.

2171
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:17,133
Yeah,

2172
01:35:17,190 --> 01:35:19,830
Dude.
Head injuries there.

2173
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:22,350
It's a weird thing.
The Dome is a weird thing,

2174
01:35:22,410 --> 01:35:25,440
you know,
with all the weird fucking shit going on

2175
01:35:25,441 --> 01:35:29,730
up there and all the different synapses
and neurons firing and one little,

2176
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:33,900
you know,
rock the somebody throws at you boxing

2177
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:35,880
the side of that.
Now you're a different person.

2178
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:37,350
Yeah.
Forever.

2179
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:39,480
Forever.
Because there's so many stories about

2180
01:35:39,481 --> 01:35:43,080
that too.
I've talked to so many doctors and

2181
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:45,630
neurologists that are,
you know,

2182
01:35:45,631 --> 01:35:48,900
they study the human brain and it's one
of the most perplexing things is like

2183
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:52,830
you can get the same two people,
one person gets hit the same way,

2184
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:56,790
nothing happens and the other person is
a different human being for the rest of

2185
01:35:56,791 --> 01:35:59,130
their life and they'll struggle with
that injury forever.

2186
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,280
And it's like real similar,
real sick,

2187
01:36:01,310 --> 01:36:03,990
real similar impact.
Real similar circumstances.

2188
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:06,930
And you just never know.
You never know what's going to do it.

2189
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:11,010
That's why these was this.
The Czech dog and round British woman

2190
01:36:11,011 --> 01:36:13,080
wakes up with Chinese accent moment.
Oh,

2191
01:36:13,081 --> 01:36:14,730
play this,
play this.

2192
01:36:14,731 --> 01:36:15,564
I want to hear her.

2193
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,980
Well.
It wasn't always the

2194
01:36:20,830 --> 01:36:22,810
sweet and sour chicken,
Hong Kong style.

2195
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:25,220
There's just been such horrible thing to
go.

2196
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:28,030
She was diagnosed with foreign actors.

2197
01:36:29,190 --> 01:36:30,023
Keep playing

2198
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,270
their reports.
Others who have suffered from the same

2199
01:36:35,271 --> 01:36:40,160
change in voice had severe migraines.
Only 61 cases have been identified since

2200
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:43,550
1941.
One explanation for the new tongue is

2201
01:36:43,551 --> 01:36:46,640
that her migraines,
which she experiences as many as 10

2202
01:36:46,641 --> 01:36:49,940
times or more per month,
are leaving her with neurological

2203
01:36:49,941 --> 01:36:52,610
damage.
The condition usually follows traumatic

2204
01:36:52,611 --> 01:36:56,870
brain injury or a stroke.
Those with fas also experienced loss of

2205
01:36:56,871 --> 01:36:57,950
vocabulary,
but

2206
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:02,090
let me hear it again.

2207
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:06,040
If he files be sweet and sour,
chicken,

2208
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:10,520
Hong Kong style
to go with that is that.

2209
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:13,480
That's her to welcome.
She doesn't have it there.

2210
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:16,300
Let me hear it again.
She was very nice accent.

2211
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:21,360
She literally will cut open.
Geminis wasn't no voice that came out of

2212
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,700
nothing.
If he files be our ticket Hong Kong

2213
01:37:24,701 --> 01:37:27,510
style,
it's just been such horrible thing to go

2214
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:28,360
with.

2215
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:31,630
She was just having an idea that's not a
Chinese accent.

2216
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:34,930
That's the broken English exit with a
Chinese,

2217
01:37:34,931 --> 01:37:37,750
uh,
from a Chinese person at why they giving

2218
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:42,751
her of all things food or
have said anything like that.

2219
01:37:45,190 --> 01:37:49,560
They gave her a food or
order Chinese

2220
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:55,030
sweet and sour.
I don't know if we can understand you in

2221
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:56,430
else with the Chinese

2222
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:57,600
assets.
Let's say this.

2223
01:37:57,601 --> 01:38:00,780
I mean,
that is kind of hilarious.

2224
01:38:00,781 --> 01:38:03,750
Like why play that play?
This one right here was this lady got.

2225
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:06,030
She's got a British just as a Houston
Mama at the British.

2226
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:10,250
What happened to her that she hit in the
head at the Queen's Tomfoolery?

2227
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:14,170
Well,
the surgery I'm having my mom at that

2228
01:38:14,171 --> 01:38:14,630
accident,

2229
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:16,880
Lisa Alameda from England,
sorry,

2230
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:18,490
is 100 percent.
Texas

2231
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:21,100
people who don't know me that,
hey,

2232
01:38:21,101 --> 01:38:24,100
where are you from?
Oh wait,

2233
01:38:24,370 --> 01:38:25,270
where's that?
I'm like,

2234
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:27,620
Oh,
you from here?

2235
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:31,480
How'd you talk like that?
So that's when the whole story comes up.

2236
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:35,340
Six months ago,
jaw surgery to fix an old changed Lisa

2237
01:38:35,341 --> 01:38:35,970
speech too.

2238
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:38,730
At that she was playing around with me.
I thought she was joking with me,

2239
01:38:38,970 --> 01:38:42,090
but then she showed me that the doctor
had told her she was diagnosed with

2240
01:38:42,091 --> 01:38:44,970
foreign accent syndrome and she searched
it and then I was like,

2241
01:38:44,971 --> 01:38:45,600
oh Lord,

2242
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:46,740
Houston Methodist,
hold up,

2243
01:38:46,741 --> 01:38:47,574
hold up,
hold up.

2244
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,130
Pause right here.
Here's the problem with that.

2245
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:53,880
I can talk like this.
It doesn't mean that I talked like this,

2246
01:38:54,030 --> 01:38:56,580
so if I come back,
like say if I got an operation,

2247
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:59,610
I wanted to get a root canal and I came
back and I started talking like this,

2248
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,260
but I've come to the Joe Rogan
experience.

2249
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:02,280
People are like,
what's wrong with you?

2250
01:39:02,281 --> 01:39:04,710
I've diagnosed with foreign accent
syndrome.

2251
01:39:05,110 --> 01:39:06,900
Then we want you to talk like you know
how to talk.

2252
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:09,210
No,
because I've been diagnosed.

2253
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:12,810
I've been diagnosed with a disease.
I have an issue.

2254
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:17,040
Please be more sensitive,
but I'm calling the news.

2255
01:39:17,041 --> 01:39:18,970
I'd like to get on the news today.
Please do.

2256
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:20,850
I can't help it.
This is how I talk now.

2257
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:25,910
Do you think they still possess the
original accent as well or is it just

2258
01:39:26,161 --> 01:39:29,310
that one?
Maybe that bitch is so dumb that I can

2259
01:39:29,311 --> 01:39:34,311
tap into and can't go back.
She says she's got one speed,

2260
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:40,320
just knocked her into second gear and
she's trying to start off the line and

2261
01:39:40,321 --> 01:39:42,650
second.
Now all I have is,

2262
01:39:44,130 --> 01:39:46,650
what is this?
This woman says she's been described as

2263
01:39:46,651 --> 01:39:48,690
speaking in Italian,
French and even Japanese.

2264
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:49,770
Oh,
she's crazy.

2265
01:39:49,771 --> 01:39:51,480
She likes attention.
Let's hear it.

2266
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:54,820
Excellent Syndrome.
Cath joins us now along with Professor

2267
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:59,190
Rosemary.
So 2006.

2268
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:01,210
She was suffering from bad health for a
little while.

2269
01:40:01,211 --> 01:40:06,211
You'd had headaches and then you spoke
to your sister on the phone and noticed

2270
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:07,910
that your voice was changing.
Yeah,

2271
01:40:07,911 --> 01:40:10,640
I started off with just the least and
um,

2272
01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:13,330
I was a good concern.
And I am with ill health.

2273
01:40:13,331 --> 01:40:16,370
I tend to get over fatigue.
So I fought it to start.

2274
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:20,080
So Dutch still there.
The next wounding solely.

2275
01:40:20,081 --> 01:40:22,090
This list was getting a little bit
strange.

2276
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:26,380
I run a stock on trends.
My role rose up there.

2277
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:29,950
Left at that time I could speak.
I record a message.

2278
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:31,390
Nobody back.
I thought,

2279
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:33,340
okay,
nothing to worry.

2280
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:38,350
Wednesday morning it was starting to go
like an alien by first year to go and

2281
01:40:38,351 --> 01:40:41,140
completely and then I lost my swallow at
the same time,

2282
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:44,530
which that's terrifying.
So scary for my family.

2283
01:40:44,531 --> 01:40:47,390
They were still terrified for me,
but we'll stop.

2284
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:48,263
Stuck me in.

2285
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:50,540
Why are they scared?
Because you talking weird or because you

2286
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:52,430
can't swallow.
He couldn't swallow.

2287
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:53,950
Yeah,
she's the only spitting out.

2288
01:40:53,951 --> 01:40:57,970
Now I've been diagnosed as inability to
swallow.

2289
01:40:58,350 --> 01:41:03,350
Come on,
diagnosed and inability to swallow.

2290
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:11,270
Plus I have a new accent.
All of a sudden this bucket with Canada

2291
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:19,770
swallow how to show you the paperwork.
I've got a prescription for a cop syrup.

2292
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:25,460
I want to cough swag,
but here's the thing then maybe.

2293
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:26,571
I mean,
look,

2294
01:41:26,571 --> 01:41:29,540
some people are barely holding onto
reality.

2295
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:33,980
You're right.
Barely need is one fucking smack.

2296
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,090
Smack upside the head and all the
sudden,

2297
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:40,730
oh,
that was sweet and hot toss off.

2298
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:44,840
Tiny former beauty pageant has foreign
accent syndrome.

2299
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:48,020
Okay.
Former beauty queen.

2300
01:41:48,050 --> 01:41:50,840
Let me hear it baby.
I'm terrible with accents.

2301
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:53,830
Okay,
so some people were wondering where I

2302
01:41:53,831 --> 01:41:55,990
got my accent from.
It's really,

2303
01:41:55,991 --> 01:41:57,220
really crazy story.

2304
01:41:58,930 --> 01:42:03,250
Foreign accent syndrome is a rare
condition that only affects crazy

2305
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:09,850
still speaking their native language.
Uh,

2306
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:14,110
let me hear her this week.
Started off with listening to this.

2307
01:42:14,150 --> 01:42:17,630
She's never left the USA Turner.
What?

2308
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:19,570
This was her accent.
Okay.

2309
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:20,481
Hold on,
hold on.

2310
01:42:20,481 --> 01:42:21,920
Stop backup.
Backup.

2311
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:25,020
Is that weed?
Sure.

2312
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:29,890
Is Weed that is fucking weed.
That is a gigantic.

2313
01:42:29,891 --> 01:42:31,960
We'd plant behind this bitch.
She's high as fuck.

2314
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:35,080
She's playing with these people.
She's playing with his people.

2315
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:38,840
This lady's high.
She's barbecued terminal.

2316
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:41,060
What your week is?
She got so high.

2317
01:42:41,061 --> 01:42:42,350
She thought she was British here

2318
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:47,000
yesterday,
which is a September 17th,

2319
01:42:47,630 --> 01:42:51,260
2011.
I started having problems with my voice.

2320
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:53,900
Oh my God.
I've got the same when I tried to talk

2321
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:55,000
and say some things,
my tongue,

2322
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:59,620
like it was right.
I had someone ask me about my ax and say

2323
01:42:59,621 --> 01:43:01,100
like,
just making a new video.

2324
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:03,770
Um,
I had a headache for about three days.

2325
01:43:03,771 --> 01:43:07,040
Got Arrested in Logan's room and this
was in May of 2015.

2326
01:43:07,610 --> 01:43:09,970
And so they put me to sleep.
Observed me.

2327
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:12,920
Pause this back.
This is nonsense.

2328
01:43:12,921 --> 01:43:14,960
This is like people think they're a Fox.
You can't.

2329
01:43:14,990 --> 01:43:17,090
You can't pick.
You can't stay in the one accent because

2330
01:43:17,091 --> 01:43:20,030
you don't know it.
No one can call people crazy anymore.

2331
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:22,700
No one calls people crazy anymore.
You're not allowed to.

2332
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:23,441
Oh,
you.

2333
01:43:23,441 --> 01:43:26,720
You are so rude.
You're insensitive to her condition may

2334
01:43:26,721 --> 01:43:30,140
be she's crazy.
May Be she's fucking crazy,

2335
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:32,870
but if you think you're a Fox like Fox
can,

2336
01:43:32,871 --> 01:43:34,810
you know there's people that are Fox can
do you know about that?

2337
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:40,440
No lot about furbies.
I love talking to you,

2338
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:44,550
right?
Ken are people that really believe that

2339
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:47,790
they're in the wrong life form,
that they should have been born at Fox,

2340
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:50,100
specifically fox,
some of them foxes.

2341
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:50,963
Some of them,
they,

2342
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:53,270
they're UNICORNS.
I think there are all kinds of shit.

2343
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:54,343
So what?

2344
01:43:57,650 --> 01:44:01,250
This is where it gets real tricky
because I think there's people that are

2345
01:44:01,251 --> 01:44:04,340
legitimately transgender,
like they were born in the wrong body.

2346
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:05,510
Legitimately.
You agree?

2347
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:06,680
Yeah,
I've met him.

2348
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:07,940
Absolutely.
I believe it.

2349
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:10,910
Yeah,
but I think there's also people that are

2350
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:15,350
fucking crazy and they just decide that
they should have been born a woman or a

2351
01:44:15,351 --> 01:44:17,990
man or they go back and forth it.
What do we got here?

2352
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:19,750
Other kin,
other Ken,

2353
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:20,720
let's call it.
Oh,

2354
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:22,490
here we go.
Think Demons.

2355
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,800
Angels.
Elvin,

2356
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:27,230
Elvin,
polymorphs.

2357
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:28,310
Oh,
I'm a polymorph.

2358
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:30,320
I've been thinking I'm a polymorph.
Thinking about,

2359
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:32,450
um,
I want to be like one of those people in

2360
01:44:32,451 --> 01:44:34,130
Avatar.
I want to be the Navi,

2361
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:38,960
Navi Kin,
the definition that fight

2362
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:43,370
other kid.
What is the other kin are people who

2363
01:44:43,371 --> 01:44:47,510
identify as partially or entirely non
human at Dragon Alliance,

2364
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:48,830
a Fox,
you name it.

2365
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:52,280
There's probably someone out there feels
like they are more of these things in

2366
01:44:52,281 --> 01:44:54,830
they are human.
The other kin community can be found

2367
01:44:54,831 --> 01:44:58,730
lurking on Reddit,
tumbler TV tropes and other online

2368
01:44:58,731 --> 01:45:02,060
forums.
I believe it.

2369
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:04,730
This poor people.
Look,

2370
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:06,770
I think they get fucked up when their
kids.

2371
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,270
Somebody probably cut the Dick when
they're a baby for all confused in

2372
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:11,240
instant trauma.

2373
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:13,130
I mean,
I have mental illness.

2374
01:45:13,131 --> 01:45:18,131
I have a cousin who is a paranoid
schizophrenia and my dad would tell me,

2375
01:45:18,801 --> 01:45:22,010
but he's my,
I don't remember how the fuck and second

2376
01:45:22,011 --> 01:45:24,110
remove shit works is my father's first
cousin.

2377
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:26,480
Okay.
Still alive dude.

2378
01:45:26,481 --> 01:45:29,330
Smoked a carton of cigarettes in three
days.

2379
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:33,440
I mean we have no idea how he's a throat
fucking left.

2380
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:38,000
But he was really fucking.
He was a black belt in karate.

2381
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:40,840
He was great at Lacrosse.
He had hopkins,

2382
01:45:40,841 --> 01:45:43,700
Syracuse,
big schools looking at him and then

2383
01:45:43,701 --> 01:45:47,260
he'll tell you he started doing drugs
and he went fucking the Syd Barrett

2384
01:45:47,270 --> 01:45:51,710
route and he just went off the fucking
deep end and he's permanent disability.

2385
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:55,550
Diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic and
um,

2386
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:56,593
you know,
he's,

2387
01:45:57,050 --> 01:46:00,380
we all love him but,
and he's fucking hilarious.

2388
01:46:00,381 --> 01:46:02,750
Like he'll play with it because
sometimes he's on his meds and you can

2389
01:46:02,751 --> 01:46:03,291
tell you're like,
oh,

2390
01:46:03,291 --> 01:46:04,260
you're dialing in right now.

2391
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:05,810
He'll start telling family secrets.
And I'm like,

2392
01:46:05,811 --> 01:46:07,850
don't listen to him.
Like not an option right now is when you

2393
01:46:07,851 --> 01:46:10,100
listen to them.
I can see it in your eyes the other

2394
01:46:10,101 --> 01:46:12,260
times when he's off looking over here
like fuck.

2395
01:46:14,030 --> 01:46:18,260
But we would go like,
he had an apartment and I would go visit

2396
01:46:18,261 --> 01:46:23,261
them from time to time and he had poetry
and sayings and stuff written all over

2397
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:25,910
the wall and I'm like,
what is this?

2398
01:46:25,911 --> 01:46:29,360
And he's like,
well at night when I'm home alone,

2399
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:33,590
the doctors come in through my window,
they drop liquid acid in my ears and

2400
01:46:33,591 --> 01:46:36,980
they knocked me out and then they
started taking samples of my body and

2401
01:46:36,981 --> 01:46:40,490
after they leave,
the love of my life comes and I can't

2402
01:46:40,491 --> 01:46:44,150
communicate with her.
So this is how I communicate with,

2403
01:46:44,151 --> 01:46:46,820
are these are there for when she comes
in to speak for me.

2404
01:46:46,821 --> 01:46:47,654
And I'm like,
Oh

2405
01:46:48,810 --> 01:46:51,150
yeah.
So his windows are nailed.

2406
01:46:51,151 --> 01:46:52,720
Shut to keep the doctors out,
Mike,

2407
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:53,700
how's that work?
And he's like,

2408
01:46:53,701 --> 01:46:58,701
it's not.
So one day I'm over there and he's

2409
01:47:00,511 --> 01:47:05,511
watching TV with the volume all the way
down and the radio up and that's how

2410
01:47:06,001 --> 01:47:09,270
he's watching this program.
And I'm telling you,

2411
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:11,310
it started to fucking make sense.
And I was like,

2412
01:47:11,311 --> 01:47:13,170
I gotta get the fuck out.
I gotta get Outta here.

2413
01:47:13,810 --> 01:47:17,100
I'm Outta here on the.
There's a disease that,

2414
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:20,250
I'm trying to remember the name of it,
but it.

2415
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:25,460
It basically is when people are around
schizophrenia looks for too long.

2416
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:29,640
They develop schizophrenia themselves.
Really?

2417
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:31,620
Yeah.
There's some people who are sympathetic

2418
01:47:31,621 --> 01:47:33,120
to it,
to the point where,

2419
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:34,950
God,
I want to say,

2420
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:39,840
I want to say it's called Allah phrenia.
There's a some sort of a disease that

2421
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:45,110
occasionally infects people or gets
people that visit people in the hospital

2422
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:49,140
that are schizophrenia,
so someone will come,

2423
01:47:49,141 --> 01:47:54,141
like family member will come visit you
and they will get diagnosed and they

2424
01:47:54,631 --> 01:47:59,220
will get admitted themselves and now
they'll actually get it.

2425
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:03,070
I don't know to what stage,
but apparently it isn't.

2426
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:06,750
It's a potential issue for some people
because like,

2427
01:48:06,751 --> 01:48:08,940
look,
have you ever been hypnotized?

2428
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:13,380
No.
I thought it was horse shit to my friend

2429
01:48:13,381 --> 01:48:16,890
Vinny shoreman who is a sports
hypnotists worse with a lot of fighters.

2430
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:17,970
He hypnotized me.
I'm like,

2431
01:48:17,971 --> 01:48:19,290
Whoa,
this is real.

2432
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:21,230
It just puts you in a very bizarre
staff.

2433
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:22,620
Feel that date.
Yes,

2434
01:48:22,621 --> 01:48:23,550
you're there,
you're awake,

2435
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,920
you're conscious,
but you're in a strange state.

2436
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:27,370
It's almost feel something.
Yeah.

2437
01:48:27,371 --> 01:48:28,220
I like.
You're like,

2438
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:33,000
like you're in a tube of consciousness
or something like you're in a womb.

2439
01:48:33,210 --> 01:48:34,470
It's very,
very interesting,

2440
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:37,680
but I'm listening to him and he's a
friend.

2441
01:48:37,681 --> 01:48:38,850
I trust him.
He's a great guy.

2442
01:48:38,851 --> 01:48:40,590
So it wasn't weird about it,
so I was like,

2443
01:48:40,591 --> 01:48:41,400
Oh yeah,
you could do it.

2444
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:42,151
Good.
Let's see.

2445
01:48:42,151 --> 01:48:43,640
Let's see what happens.
I was Kinda skeptical.

2446
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:44,473
It's like,
this is horse shit,

2447
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:47,130
but I've been to.
Have you ever been to one of those

2448
01:48:47,131 --> 01:48:49,260
hypnotists comedy shows?
No.

2449
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,860
My friend Frank Santos,
he was a guy who,

2450
01:48:52,861 --> 01:48:54,120
uh,
he's passed away,

2451
01:48:54,121 --> 01:48:59,121
but he was a big time comedy hypnotist,
guy in Boston and in Rhode Island and he

2452
01:49:00,271 --> 01:49:02,610
had a show and he,
I saw his show man.

2453
01:49:02,611 --> 01:49:06,630
He used to do like one night a week at
stitches and one night a week at Nick's

2454
01:49:06,631 --> 01:49:08,220
comedy stop.
And Dude,

2455
01:49:08,221 --> 01:49:11,220
we would go down there on days off just
to watch.

2456
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,410
It was crazy.
He would take people out of the

2457
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:14,580
audience,
like who wants to be able to tie.

2458
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:16,330
And he had a weird way of talking who
wants to be able to,

2459
01:49:16,510 --> 01:49:20,640
you want to be hypnotized con.
It was like a around jolly fellow real

2460
01:49:20,641 --> 01:49:22,060
friendly glasses,
you know,

2461
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:24,100
like totally unassuming.
You didn't think you'd.

2462
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:28,410
And then he would bring these people on
stage and he would just be able to take

2463
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:29,670
sweetie,
you're going to go under.

2464
01:49:29,671 --> 01:49:30,840
You're gonna,
you're gonna fall asleep.

2465
01:49:30,841 --> 01:49:32,730
You're gonna fall asleep.
When I snap my fingers,

2466
01:49:32,731 --> 01:49:35,490
you're going to thank you.
Or Sally fields have right next to you

2467
01:49:35,491 --> 01:49:40,330
is burt reynolds
and you would see these people and they

2468
01:49:40,331 --> 01:49:41,820
really.
They were like smokey.

2469
01:49:41,821 --> 01:49:44,670
We got to get away from the police.
Like they really believed.

2470
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:46,620
He had this one guy.
He told her.

2471
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:47,950
He me what day would actually

2472
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:49,340
speak like that person.

2473
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:49,801
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2474
01:49:49,801 --> 01:49:51,180
yeah.
They didn't know what they were out of.

2475
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:54,500
This one guy,
he told the guy this was the eighties.

2476
01:49:54,590 --> 01:49:57,080
He told the guy that the guy was having
sex with Madonna.

2477
01:49:57,110 --> 01:50:00,200
He's like underneath you as Madonna and
you're squeezing her booties,

2478
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:01,550
your Boobie,
her boobies,

2479
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:03,860
and she's naked and you're about to have
sex with her.

2480
01:50:03,861 --> 01:50:05,630
You're going to have sex.
You're having sex with her right now,

2481
01:50:05,690 --> 01:50:08,750
and the guy had an orgasm on the stage.
He's,

2482
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,220
he's sitting there on the stage,
he's like,

2483
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:12,000
oh,
and the audience,

2484
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:14,990
I'm talking,
people have fallen out of their fucking

2485
01:50:14,991 --> 01:50:16,700
chairs.
The crying,

2486
01:50:16,701 --> 01:50:17,840
laughing,
you couldn't,

2487
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:21,230
but it was real man and some people,
it wasn't real.

2488
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:22,520
Like some people would look at him and
he go,

2489
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:23,211
hey,
hey buddy,

2490
01:50:23,211 --> 01:50:23,961
hey buddy,
look at me,

2491
01:50:23,961 --> 01:50:25,560
look at me.
You're not under good.

2492
01:50:25,570 --> 01:50:26,370
Come on and come off the stage.

2493
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:27,320
I was like,
ah.

2494
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:29,960
And the guy would come up to say he
would know who was under who wasn't

2495
01:50:29,961 --> 01:50:32,120
under this guy was a.
He would work with people who were

2496
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:34,560
trying to quit smoking and trying to
quit gambling.

2497
01:50:34,561 --> 01:50:37,950
A friend that did the smoking thing,
gambling booze.

2498
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:40,680
They can apparently they can do it with
a lot of different things with him,

2499
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:42,910
but smoking is a big one,
but he,

2500
01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:46,010
he just could do it to some people and
I'm telling you quick,

2501
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:48,710
he would do it and there's fucking 300
people in the room,

2502
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:50,840
but he would be like,
I'm going to cut my fingers from the

2503
01:50:50,841 --> 01:50:52,850
count of three.
You're in the car and the police are

2504
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:53,780
chasing you.
One,

2505
01:50:53,781 --> 01:50:54,590
two,
three.

2506
01:50:54,590 --> 01:50:57,080
What are you doing now?
I'm in the car and the cops are chasing

2507
01:50:57,081 --> 01:50:59,440
me and it was just instant man.
I mean it was.

2508
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,580
It was.
Some people,

2509
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:05,330
they just fall into these states of mind
and they're open to suggestion.

2510
01:51:05,331 --> 01:51:09,560
Some people can be hypnotized and this
is why some people I think join cults,

2511
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:12,380
like I'm watching this new netflix
program,

2512
01:51:12,410 --> 01:51:16,670
wild wild country,
fuck crazy.

2513
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:21,890
But some people I think are more
susceptible to suggestion and more

2514
01:51:21,891 --> 01:51:24,890
susceptible to colds and I think that
is,

2515
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:27,360
that's what's happening.
I think that's what's happening with

2516
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:29,750
this Allah phrenia thing,
if that's what it's called,

2517
01:51:29,870 --> 01:51:31,550
I'm.
I might be remembering that incorrectly,

2518
01:51:31,970 --> 01:51:33,910
but this,
this thing that you've been around a

2519
01:51:33,911 --> 01:51:38,440
schizophrenia person,
like whatever weird error,

2520
01:51:38,570 --> 01:51:42,440
their brain is making your.
Your brain tunes into that error and you

2521
01:51:42,441 --> 01:51:43,460
start going crazy too.

2522
01:51:43,590 --> 01:51:46,260
As soon as that shit made sense,
I was like,

2523
01:51:46,261 --> 01:51:48,810
I gotta get the fuck out of here because
he's done.

2524
01:51:50,130 --> 01:51:53,310
He's harmed.
He's never heard anyone but he still,

2525
01:51:53,311 --> 01:51:54,980
you know,
these days he's white.

2526
01:51:54,990 --> 01:51:57,990
He's pro guys probably in his sixties,
not in any kind of shape,

2527
01:51:57,991 --> 01:52:00,390
but back then when he still knew of
martial arts,

2528
01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:04,890
he was dangerous,
but he never hurt anybody but he knew

2529
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:09,720
how to and so one day there's eastern
avenue in Baltimore's,

2530
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:13,530
for lack of a better term,
the Ventura Boulevard of Baltimore shops

2531
01:52:13,531 --> 01:52:16,230
everywhere and everything.
And there was this one woman that had

2532
01:52:16,231 --> 01:52:21,231
cut his hair one time and for him,
excuse me to touch his head,

2533
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:25,980
was a big deal for him this.
So he immediately fell in love with this

2534
01:52:25,981 --> 01:52:27,810
lady.
Her name was Clarissa.

2535
01:52:28,410 --> 01:52:32,520
So he went home and got his guitar and
the thing about this guitar,

2536
01:52:32,521 --> 01:52:35,370
like this dude would pawn his bed,
his guitar,

2537
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:36,233
everything.

2538
01:52:36,270 --> 01:52:41,270
But that guitar was always out of tune
exactly the same way.

2539
01:52:41,590 --> 01:52:43,140
You understand what I'm saying?
Does that make sense?

2540
01:52:43,141 --> 01:52:44,760
Okay.
So always fucked up,

2541
01:52:44,761 --> 01:52:47,300
but always consistently fucked up every
guitar he had.

2542
01:52:47,330 --> 01:52:49,340
That's how he tuned it.
That's how he heard it.

2543
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:53,990
Oh Wow.
So he writes her that he writes her a

2544
01:52:53,991 --> 01:52:57,980
love song and he wants to go up to her
shop and now sing it for her.

2545
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:04,090
So he goes up and he stands out in front
of the shop and he's gets her attention.

2546
01:53:04,461 --> 01:53:07,220
He's got his guitar and he's gone.
It starts off where he goes.

2547
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:08,061
He goes,
Chris,

2548
01:53:08,061 --> 01:53:10,970
I love you in Baltimore accidents.
Her name's Clarissa.

2549
01:53:10,971 --> 01:53:11,870
But he says,
Chris,

2550
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:14,870
Okay Chris,
I love you Chris.

2551
01:53:14,871 --> 01:53:16,070
I need you.
Then he goes,

2552
01:53:16,071 --> 01:53:17,280
chrystal,
daggers of Christian,

2553
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:20,030
all crack because I want to crystal.
And she's freaking out like,

2554
01:53:20,031 --> 01:53:20,510
what the fuck?

2555
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:21,261
Yeah,
like your eyes.

2556
01:53:21,261 --> 01:53:25,190
So they call the police,
he gets arrested.

2557
01:53:26,190 --> 01:53:29,000
He doesn't understand why he's arrested
in his mind.

2558
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:31,940
What did I do wrong?
I just wrote a beautiful song for

2559
01:53:31,941 --> 01:53:33,860
someone I care about and I wanted to
share it with her.

2560
01:53:33,861 --> 01:53:36,200
So my cousins,
all of us were like,

2561
01:53:36,201 --> 01:53:39,480
we gotta go to court and watch this.
This is going to offend because he's

2562
01:53:39,490 --> 01:53:42,370
got,
he's got to go to court.

2563
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:46,470
So they bring them out from the back and
he stands up and it's a,

2564
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:48,190
it's a female judge.
And um,

2565
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:49,071
my,
his mom,

2566
01:53:49,071 --> 01:53:50,450
my aunt Margaret,
she's my great aunt.

2567
01:53:50,451 --> 01:53:54,650
My grandma's sister buys extended family
big time and we're all there watching.

2568
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:58,180
And the judge says,
ask the girl her side of things.

2569
01:53:58,190 --> 01:53:59,510
It's like,
well this happened and he's like,

2570
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:02,090
she's like,
would you like to speak on your behalf?

2571
01:54:02,091 --> 01:54:03,860
And he's like,
I just don't understand what I did

2572
01:54:03,861 --> 01:54:04,220
wrong.

2573
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:07,280
I wrote a song for someone I care about
and I just wanted to share it.

2574
01:54:07,281 --> 01:54:09,680
And she's like,
would you mind sharing some of the

2575
01:54:09,681 --> 01:54:10,640
lyrics?
And we're all like,

2576
01:54:10,730 --> 01:54:13,460
oh shit.
And He fucking Chris,

2577
01:54:13,461 --> 01:54:15,920
I love you Chris.
I need you chrysotile crack because I

2578
01:54:15,921 --> 01:54:16,671
want to die.
She goes,

2579
01:54:16,671 --> 01:54:17,330
okay,
okay,

2580
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:18,500
that's enough.
That's enough.

2581
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:22,640
And then they're about to let him go
because they understand I'm going to put

2582
01:54:22,641 --> 01:54:25,250
a restraining order.
He's under supervision,

2583
01:54:25,251 --> 01:54:26,420
but they're about to let them go.
And she goes,

2584
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:27,283
oh,
wait a second.

2585
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:28,513
Oh,
there's a,

2586
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:31,160
Oh,
there's still an open charge here on the

2587
01:54:31,161 --> 01:54:33,810
books so we're going to have to take you
back to it.

2588
01:54:33,811 --> 01:54:37,820
He starts losing his shit.
Like what my Mr. greet stands up and to

2589
01:54:37,821 --> 01:54:38,654
a judge.
She goes,

2590
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:40,340
Hun,
we dropped those charges.

2591
01:54:40,341 --> 01:54:41,990
Everyone calls,
people hunt in Baltimore.

2592
01:54:41,991 --> 01:54:42,471
She goes,
Hun,

2593
01:54:42,471 --> 01:54:43,304
we dropped the destroyed.

2594
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:44,570
That lady said,
first of all,

2595
01:54:45,570 --> 01:54:48,590
you don't call me honey.
I am a judge.

2596
01:54:48,591 --> 01:54:53,591
You address me as your honor.
We're all like already got gold and they

2597
01:54:54,471 --> 01:54:56,780
fucking took him back and he was
screaming,

2598
01:54:56,781 --> 01:54:58,820
going on.
They put the family,

2599
01:54:58,821 --> 01:55:00,110
put a charge on him.
Yeah,

2600
01:55:00,111 --> 01:55:02,450
he had.
He would do things like he would show up

2601
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:05,390
to their place in a cab demand.
They pay for it.

2602
01:55:05,391 --> 01:55:07,250
They didn't.
He throw a brick through the window so

2603
01:55:07,251 --> 01:55:12,251
they had
a resident for that.

2604
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:17,690
Jesus really did drop the charges,
but it was just a clerical error that

2605
01:55:17,691 --> 01:55:19,400
never made it to the paperwork.
And she's like,

2606
01:55:19,401 --> 01:55:21,440
I got to do what I gotta do.
We're taking you back today.

2607
01:55:21,441 --> 01:55:23,240
And he was,
they were pulling it back and he was

2608
01:55:23,241 --> 01:55:25,190
going nuts.
Oh my God,

2609
01:55:25,191 --> 01:55:27,500
yes.
Ended up fucking haircut.

2610
01:55:28,050 --> 01:55:31,190
He would say shit and he would swear to
me that nurses would give him head in

2611
01:55:31,191 --> 01:55:33,340
the hospital.
He would,

2612
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:35,690
and part of the time they're like,
I don't know,

2613
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:41,200
but one that really blew my mind was um,
he had this scab on his stomach and he

2614
01:55:42,171 --> 01:55:44,640
was like,
they coming in and cut me and tested me

2615
01:55:44,641 --> 01:55:46,140
and they're taking me to the doctor
today,

2616
01:55:46,141 --> 01:55:48,570
Ryan,
I think I got something.

2617
01:55:48,571 --> 01:55:50,730
I think I got a disease and that,
that cut.

2618
01:55:50,910 --> 01:55:51,810
I'm like,
what are you going to do?

2619
01:55:51,811 --> 01:55:52,980
He's like,
I got a plan.

2620
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:55,670
So I talked to him later that day and I
was like,

2621
01:55:55,671 --> 01:55:57,500
what did you do about that disease,
man?

2622
01:55:57,501 --> 01:55:58,880
He goes,
you know what I did with that scab?

2623
01:55:58,940 --> 01:56:02,840
I picked it off and throw it away.
He thought the scab

2624
01:56:04,730 --> 01:56:07,100
and you can just flick it away and be
like,

2625
01:56:07,101 --> 01:56:12,101
that shit's gone.
We're now imagine that's where he gets

2626
01:56:13,010 --> 01:56:14,540
that talk about people like it's not
funny.

2627
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:15,660
Melted and it's not.

2628
01:56:15,690 --> 01:56:18,150
Mental illness is obviously funny,
but the shit he would do,

2629
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:21,090
we would take him.
So it'd be me and my two brothers,

2630
01:56:21,091 --> 01:56:23,490
his daughter in Tucson's on Christmas
Eve,

2631
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:26,010
we'd go over,
we take them a plate of food.

2632
01:56:26,011 --> 01:56:28,890
We'd hang out with them for a little
while and Shit and there'll be times

2633
01:56:28,891 --> 01:56:30,060
where he's like,
you guys got a joint,

2634
01:56:30,061 --> 01:56:35,061
like we shouldn't be smoking,
so we give them a joint and he smokes it

2635
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:38,910
and now we're driving back to my aunt's
in the city,

2636
01:56:38,911 --> 01:56:42,540
which is 12 minutes away.
We get back.

2637
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:45,350
What are you all given him?
We Hebrew.

2638
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:46,810
He would rat us out.
He

2639
01:56:48,950 --> 01:56:50,630
came over and gave it a food.
Thanks.

2640
01:56:50,631 --> 01:56:52,400
By the way,
they gave you a big fat joint.

2641
01:56:52,401 --> 01:56:54,770
So then we would play it at why you
listen to his crazy ass.

2642
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:57,340
Nobody gave him like we all had to be
able to say Tiki.

2643
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:01,673
Oh,
he would.

2644
01:57:01,790 --> 01:57:02,440
He.

2645
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:04,480
He smokes.
He would come to my grandma's house.

2646
01:57:04,481 --> 01:57:08,350
When I live with her,
he'd sit in a chair and he smoked

2647
01:57:08,351 --> 01:57:09,490
cigarettes like this.
I mean,

2648
01:57:09,510 --> 01:57:12,940
he doesn't put any farther away than
three by three inches from his mouth and

2649
01:57:12,941 --> 01:57:14,290
not just down.
Done,

2650
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:14,951
down,
done.

2651
01:57:14,951 --> 01:57:16,360
And he'll do.
He'll go through three packs.

2652
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:19,240
My,
his mom died of breast cancer and she

2653
01:57:19,241 --> 01:57:21,080
would say all the time,
I don't know how he even has a fucking

2654
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:23,980
throat left and I'm dying of cancer over
here and he is.

2655
01:57:23,981 --> 01:57:26,080
He's still alive.
Still alive.

2656
01:57:26,081 --> 01:57:30,850
Smoking cigarettes like that to still
smoking cigarettes or a carton in three

2657
01:57:30,851 --> 01:57:31,870
days.
What does a carton?

2658
01:57:32,110 --> 01:57:33,400
I don't even know.
Twenty packs.

2659
01:57:34,150 --> 01:57:36,240
That's roughly seven packs a day.
Something like

2660
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:39,400
a day for.
For decades.

2661
01:57:39,850 --> 01:57:44,570
For decades.
Oh my God.

2662
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:47,060
That is so crazy.
Now.

2663
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:48,850
What?
Do you remember what he was like before?

2664
01:57:48,851 --> 01:57:49,350
Okay.

2665
01:57:49,350 --> 01:57:52,590
Phrenic.
I don't because when I was a kid he was

2666
01:57:52,591 --> 01:57:55,080
already gone,
but my dad loved them and would bring

2667
01:57:55,081 --> 01:57:56,610
them out to the house because he was
safe.

2668
01:57:56,611 --> 01:57:58,920
He was just crazy.
He would say shit and he'd be like,

2669
01:57:58,921 --> 01:58:00,270
don't you know,
don't give them a break.

2670
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:02,340
Yeah,
don't forget to write and be nice.

2671
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:03,640
Don't give them a bug.
A Brit.

2672
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:06,930
But my dad will tell me all the time.
He was a phenomenal athlete.

2673
01:58:06,931 --> 01:58:08,250
Like I said,
great at karate.

2674
01:58:08,251 --> 01:58:10,920
He had a black belt.
He was cross.

2675
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:12,510
No,
just a sweat.

2676
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:15,630
He tried to tell me,
so highland town is the area where,

2677
01:58:15,631 --> 01:58:17,370
uh,
my aunt never,

2678
01:58:17,371 --> 01:58:19,590
this is the old Greek town in Baltimore.
It's not,

2679
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:20,483
it's,
you know,

2680
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:23,460
Greek as long gone in that neighborhood,
but that's where he grew up and he would

2681
01:58:23,461 --> 01:58:27,150
try to tell me that highland town was
the Haight Ashbury in Baltimore.

2682
01:58:27,151 --> 01:58:28,680
I was like,
get the fuck out of here with that

2683
01:58:28,681 --> 01:58:30,480
garbage.
But he was doing acid,

2684
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,060
you know,
early 11.

2685
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:38,190
And he dabble.
I think he said that early and then

2686
01:58:38,700 --> 01:58:41,170
eventually after like into the college
years,

2687
01:58:41,171 --> 01:58:42,340
the twenties,
he really

2688
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:46,090
fucking ramped it up and he was almost
100 percent.

2689
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:50,500
He made himself crazy story.
The common story is people that have a

2690
01:58:50,501 --> 01:58:55,270
tendency to schizophrenia or they may be
the likelihood of developing it later in

2691
01:58:55,271 --> 01:58:56,980
their life.
Acid trips,

2692
01:58:57,190 --> 01:58:58,630
mushroom trips,
heavy.

2693
01:58:58,631 --> 01:59:01,090
Psychedelics tend to bring out
schizophrenia.

2694
01:59:01,660 --> 01:59:06,010
They tend to make it manifest.
So maybe he was ripe for it because

2695
01:59:06,490 --> 01:59:09,010
there's no other mental illness in the
family.

2696
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:10,900
It's just him.
Just him.

2697
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:11,951
Yeah,
man.

2698
01:59:11,951 --> 01:59:14,410
I think especially when you're young,
you know,

2699
01:59:14,411 --> 01:59:16,630
I mean,
think about how many people have had

2700
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:19,630
horrible,
horrible acid trips just taken way too

2701
01:59:19,631 --> 01:59:24,370
much and tried to fight it and just been
fucked up for days and weeks and then

2702
01:59:24,371 --> 01:59:27,640
you still feel slippery.
You life feels weird.

2703
01:59:27,641 --> 01:59:31,660
Even after those trips.
I had a DMT trip one time that fucked me

2704
01:59:31,661 --> 01:59:34,660
up for a couple weeks,
like for a couple of weeks afterwards

2705
01:59:34,661 --> 01:59:37,000
I'd be driving my car to be thinking
there's going to be a car.

2706
01:59:37,130 --> 01:59:41,470
It's going to launch itself off the
fucking the the oncoming lane and fly

2707
01:59:41,471 --> 01:59:43,720
right into me.
I was thinking I had this image that was

2708
01:59:43,721 --> 01:59:45,280
going to be upside down in the.
The.

2709
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:49,390
The car was going to hit the windshield,
flying upside down and down and just

2710
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:51,850
slammed for weeks,
weeks,

2711
01:59:52,060 --> 01:59:54,430
weeks afterwards.
That's why I'm scared of that shit.

2712
01:59:54,450 --> 01:59:58,300
It's because I tried to think about what
was possibly happening.

2713
01:59:58,301 --> 02:00:03,301
I think it dissolved my ego so much and
it made me think so much about how

2714
02:00:06,460 --> 02:00:11,460
relatively unimportant every single
person is in terms of the greater scheme

2715
02:00:12,521 --> 02:00:17,521
of the universe that whatever it did to
me had broke down all my conceptions of

2716
02:00:18,941 --> 02:00:21,760
myself,
all my preconceived notions of myself so

2717
02:00:21,761 --> 02:00:26,761
much that my ego was freaking out so it
tried to invent danger,

2718
02:00:27,130 --> 02:00:30,550
so I would have to be more primal to
defend myself again,

2719
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:31,510
look out and look out over there.

2720
02:00:31,510 --> 02:00:33,370
There's danger instead of me going,
man,

2721
02:00:33,371 --> 02:00:35,110
what the fuck is life?
What is this?

2722
02:00:35,111 --> 02:00:37,810
What is.
What is the energy that courses through

2723
02:00:37,811 --> 02:00:39,610
your body?
What is the purpose of the human race?

2724
02:00:39,611 --> 02:00:41,110
Like?
What are we moving towards?

2725
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:43,660
Why are we so committed to innovation
and technology?

2726
02:00:43,661 --> 02:00:48,280
I all these crazy thoughts where I was
trying to figure out what the purpose of

2727
02:00:48,570 --> 02:00:53,500
the activities of the human race war
that it was so bizarrely different than

2728
02:00:53,501 --> 02:00:57,070
my normal pattern of thought that my
mind just started coming up with all

2729
02:00:57,071 --> 02:00:59,980
sorts of weird paranoid ideas with
things.

2730
02:01:00,230 --> 02:01:03,700
It took me like two weeks before a
normalized and after two weeks I felt

2731
02:01:03,701 --> 02:01:06,520
nora and I didn't do dmt again for years
after that.

2732
02:01:06,550 --> 02:01:09,100
So here's.
Comedians have come on and talked about

2733
02:01:09,110 --> 02:01:10,510
it.
Is it?

2734
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:13,300
Is it just.
I'm obviously asking you because I'm

2735
02:01:13,301 --> 02:01:15,580
ignorant is DMT,
isn't that the chemical?

2736
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:19,390
Your body releases as you die,
your body releases you die,

2737
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:22,450
but they don't really know.
They know that your body makes it.

2738
02:01:22,830 --> 02:01:24,550
They know that your liver makes in your
lungs,

2739
02:01:24,551 --> 02:01:27,280
make it,
and they think that your pineal gland

2740
02:01:27,281 --> 02:01:30,190
makes it,
which is your third eye and reptiles

2741
02:01:30,191 --> 02:01:32,470
that actually has a retina and a lens.
Really?

2742
02:01:32,530 --> 02:01:33,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

2743
02:01:33,551 --> 02:01:36,280
The pineal gland,
it sits in the center of your brain

2744
02:01:36,281 --> 02:01:39,470
literally die.
Like if you look at like a third and the

2745
02:01:39,471 --> 02:01:41,870
eastern mysticism,
that's where the pineal gland is,

2746
02:01:42,350 --> 02:01:45,830
and now they know that rats,
while they're alive,

2747
02:01:45,950 --> 02:01:50,690
produced dmt and the pineal gland.
This is a new study that was done.

2748
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:55,310
I think this research was published over
the last five or six years,

2749
02:01:55,700 --> 02:01:59,150
so because of the fact that they know
that now they're assuming that human

2750
02:01:59,151 --> 02:02:02,090
beings also produce in the pineal gland,
which would,

2751
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:06,080
you know,
it kind of sort of verifies what

2752
02:02:06,081 --> 02:02:08,510
everybody always thought the pineal
gland as they thought they would call

2753
02:02:08,511 --> 02:02:09,740
it,
the seed of the soul,

2754
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:14,120
that this is where your,
your journey to the afterlife begins and

2755
02:02:14,121 --> 02:02:18,140
the pineal gland and that this chemical
gateway opens up and your soul passes

2756
02:02:18,141 --> 02:02:22,400
through to the great beyond,
but it can it be like a bad trip on the

2757
02:02:22,401 --> 02:02:23,234
way out?

2758
02:02:23,650 --> 02:02:24,610
Yes.
Yes.

2759
02:02:24,670 --> 02:02:25,503
Yes.
I've met.

2760
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:28,040
I've been with people who've had bad dmt
trips.

2761
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:32,330
I was his stan hope.
I got stan hope high on DMT and I

2762
02:02:32,331 --> 02:02:33,770
thought he was dying.
He's at,

2763
02:02:33,820 --> 02:02:36,560
he's at my house and he's.
He's moaning and foaming at the mouth.

2764
02:02:36,590 --> 02:02:38,260
He's like raw.

2765
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:42,620
I'd never seen anybody do that before.
I'd see a bunch of people.

2766
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:45,410
Most people smoke dmt.
They do this,

2767
02:02:45,470 --> 02:02:46,730
they smoke it,
and then they just go.

2768
02:02:49,320 --> 02:02:52,850
They lay back and then this,
this overwhelming experience happens to

2769
02:02:52,851 --> 02:02:56,060
them for like 15 minutes and then they
come back to it and then they come back.

2770
02:02:56,061 --> 02:02:57,020
Yeah.
They don't move.

2771
02:02:57,260 --> 02:02:58,730
They just,
that's not ours.

2772
02:02:58,780 --> 02:02:59,421
No,
no,

2773
02:02:59,421 --> 02:03:00,800
no.
It's a quick experience.

2774
02:03:00,980 --> 02:03:05,480
Iowasca is an orally active experience
with Dmt,

2775
02:03:05,481 --> 02:03:09,710
with Iowasca is when you,
if you tried to eat dmt,

2776
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:14,090
dmt is broken down in your gut by
something called Mano Aiming Oxidase.

2777
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:18,290
So when they make Iowasca,
what they do is they take part of one

2778
02:03:18,291 --> 02:03:21,950
plant which has dimethyltryptamine and
part of another plant which has

2779
02:03:21,951 --> 02:03:24,380
something called harming,
which is a dmp.

2780
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:28,040
It's a mano aiming oxidase inhibitor.
Um,

2781
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:31,990
Mao inhibitors,
there's some and medications and the sub

2782
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,770
is a bunch of,
like you gotta be very careful if you're

2783
02:03:33,771 --> 02:03:37,670
taking mushrooms or something else that
you not taking Mao inhibitors as well.

2784
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:41,330
But.
So you take this stuff together and what

2785
02:03:41,331 --> 02:03:43,880
it does is it gives you an orally active
dmt trip.

2786
02:03:43,881 --> 02:03:48,090
So as it's broken down by your gut,
it's like a slow release dmt trip that

2787
02:03:48,091 --> 02:03:53,091
will take several hours as opposed to
this fucking rocket ship ride to the

2788
02:03:53,751 --> 02:03:55,640
center of the universe that you get when
you take it,

2789
02:03:55,641 --> 02:03:58,430
when you smoke it,
because when you smoke it or intravenous

2790
02:03:58,431 --> 02:04:00,330
use,
if you go to a doctor and knows how to

2791
02:04:00,331 --> 02:04:03,060
do that,
that goes directly into your bloodstream

2792
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:06,410
and it's just so.
It is impossible to avoid.

2793
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:08,210
You cannot,
you can't hang on,

2794
02:04:08,390 --> 02:04:11,990
you're just going to take you to the
center of the universe and you're going

2795
02:04:11,991 --> 02:04:16,991
to experience life forms and interaction
with spirits and angels and aliens and

2796
02:04:17,810 --> 02:04:18,740
gestures.
For me,

2797
02:04:18,741 --> 02:04:20,930
it was a bunch of gestures that were
giving me the finger.

2798
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:24,830
It was rate giving me the finger like
fuck you.

2799
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:27,110
Like it was very,
very,

2800
02:04:27,140 --> 02:04:28,550
very,
very powerful.

2801
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:31,130
Um,
but that Stan hope one was the only time

2802
02:04:31,131 --> 02:04:33,170
I ever saw someone who I thought they
were going to die.

2803
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:35,450
And I was thinking,
what if I killed one of my best friends?

2804
02:04:35,630 --> 02:04:36,291
Like,
what have I killed?

2805
02:04:36,291 --> 02:04:38,220
Stan hope I get you.
I was like,

2806
02:04:39,370 --> 02:04:41,850
I don't remember.
I think I did it first because I think

2807
02:04:41,851 --> 02:04:42,840
he had,
he hadn't done it before,

2808
02:04:42,841 --> 02:04:43,531
so I said,
I'll do it.

2809
02:04:43,531 --> 02:04:46,380
Just watch me do it and just sit down
here and then you do it next.

2810
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:47,820
So I did it.
I'm gone.

2811
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:49,290
Fifteen minutes,
come back.

2812
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:49,891
I'm like,
you're ready.

2813
02:04:49,891 --> 02:04:50,724
He's like,
yeah.

2814
02:04:51,870 --> 02:04:55,200
So I give it to him and you know,
Stan hope's been drinking since he was

2815
02:04:55,201 --> 02:05:00,201
three.
His body is a loosely held together with

2816
02:05:01,531 --> 02:05:02,710
duct tape,
you know,

2817
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:07,470
lies down if he lies down and pushes his
stomach out.

2818
02:05:07,620 --> 02:05:11,460
He's got these.
He's got these fucking.

2819
02:05:11,550 --> 02:05:12,530
What is it called?
Hemp.

2820
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:13,920
No hemorrhoids.
What is it called?

2821
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:15,153
Hurt.
He is.

2822
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:17,040
He's got hernias.
Was his stomach,

2823
02:05:17,041 --> 02:05:19,800
will poke through the wall of his
stomach or his,

2824
02:05:19,801 --> 02:05:23,430
uh,
his gut will pop all of his abdomen.

2825
02:05:23,690 --> 02:05:25,020
He was,
he's got a bunch of those.

2826
02:05:25,150 --> 02:05:28,050
You got them all over the place.
Just like this little pop up,

2827
02:05:28,051 --> 02:05:29,290
like you're supposed to get those

2828
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:34,790
up.
He just keeps on trucking.

2829
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:39,500
And I've talked to him about this too.
He's like one of those no MRI guys.

2830
02:05:39,710 --> 02:05:41,090
Nah,
no doctors,

2831
02:05:41,091 --> 02:05:42,190
no Mris.
And I go,

2832
02:05:42,790 --> 02:05:44,090
I don't want to know what's going on in
there.

2833
02:05:44,180 --> 02:05:46,280
That's everyone did and my family,
by the way,

2834
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:47,380
that's why I go to dog

2835
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:52,210
and every so,
and this was more than 10 years ago.

2836
02:05:52,240 --> 02:05:55,060
This was probably 2002 while this was
all going down,

2837
02:05:55,270 --> 02:05:59,890
so me and stan hope or on my couch and
he is moaning like this,

2838
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:07,210
some farms coming out of the corner of
his mouth and he's like,

2839
02:06:07,211 --> 02:06:10,330
slumped over and I'm just praying to.
I'm like,

2840
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:12,730
please don't die.
Please don't.

2841
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:16,050
Because I didn't expect this.
I expected what everybody else who I've

2842
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:19,090
seen maybe a handful of people do dmt.
They all do the same thing.

2843
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:20,590
They smoke it,
they laid back,

2844
02:06:20,830 --> 02:06:22,870
they tripped balls,
they come back in 15 minutes and they're

2845
02:06:22,871 --> 02:06:24,610
like,
what the fuck was that about?

2846
02:06:25,150 --> 02:06:26,950
But he was.
But then he came back and is like,

2847
02:06:26,951 --> 02:06:28,060
oh,
life eats life

2848
02:06:29,870 --> 02:06:30,460
cycle.
It's like,

2849
02:06:30,460 --> 02:06:33,520
it just goes on.
And so the next thing and then life goes

2850
02:06:33,521 --> 02:06:35,050
on and life is like,
Gosh,

2851
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:38,050
I'm so far behind them so far behind
with my thinking.

2852
02:06:38,470 --> 02:06:42,160
I'm so far behind with everything
and I'm just like,

2853
02:06:42,161 --> 02:06:43,450
I'm just glad you're alive dude.

2854
02:06:43,620 --> 02:06:44,460
Yeah,
no shit.

2855
02:06:45,170 --> 02:06:47,820
I almost killed my cousin like that two
times.

2856
02:06:47,821 --> 02:06:50,280
I've watched people almost die on drugs
that I was with.

2857
02:06:50,850 --> 02:06:54,630
The one that scared me was my cousin.
We found out my cousin timmy is a.

2858
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:56,760
he's allergic to.
It's got to be thc.

2859
02:06:56,790 --> 02:06:57,960
He's allergic to wheat.
It,

2860
02:06:57,961 --> 02:07:02,100
it just destroys.
I mean like that will fucking turn him

2861
02:07:02,101 --> 02:07:04,800
gray.
And so this is what I,

2862
02:07:04,940 --> 02:07:08,160
what we didn't know.
So his younger sister had had a,

2863
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:12,960
she was turning 19 I think it was.
And I'm living with them at the time.

2864
02:07:12,970 --> 02:07:13,560
I,
I,

2865
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:16,470
my grandmother just passed away and I
don't have a place to stay.

2866
02:07:16,471 --> 02:07:20,460
And her sister,
my aunt Marie took me in and I'm living

2867
02:07:20,461 --> 02:07:22,860
with them and my cousin,
Jennifer's like,

2868
02:07:22,861 --> 02:07:25,230
I'm having a birthday party tonight.
The house,

2869
02:07:25,231 --> 02:07:26,610
the girls are all going to come back
here.

2870
02:07:26,611 --> 02:07:29,250
Right.
So my,

2871
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:33,930
we get some good weed from Oregon.
It was rare to get good fucking bud from

2872
02:07:33,931 --> 02:07:36,040
the west coast in the early,
you

2873
02:07:36,050 --> 02:07:38,530
know,
the nineties regularly in.

2874
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:40,330
You always got,
we call it a practice.

2875
02:07:40,331 --> 02:07:44,860
We'd as we always bugging got,
but this shit came and I rolled one.

2876
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:46,240
Oh,
it was beautiful.

2877
02:07:46,241 --> 02:07:49,030
It just had a pencil point to a while.
We're smoking it and I was like,

2878
02:07:49,031 --> 02:07:50,050
let's.
It's February.

2879
02:07:50,051 --> 02:07:52,780
It's so fucking cold that,
that bone chilling cold.

2880
02:07:52,781 --> 02:07:54,820
I'm like,
let's go sit in my car and we'll smoke

2881
02:07:54,821 --> 02:07:57,420
this joint.
I had a 1990 Honda civic with original

2882
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:58,263
rims,
Bro.

2883
02:07:59,170 --> 02:08:04,170
We're in their fucking smoking.
We're listening to Hendrix and he takes

2884
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:07,570
one hit and he goes,
let me have a more.

2885
02:08:07,571 --> 02:08:08,241
I'm like,
you shouldn't.

2886
02:08:08,241 --> 02:08:09,100
And you remember that.
He's like,

2887
02:08:09,101 --> 02:08:09,731
let me have one.
I'm like,

2888
02:08:09,731 --> 02:08:11,700
this is really strong weeds.
I mean I have one more.

2889
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:15,430
He hits one more,
so we get out of the car and he's like,

2890
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:17,020
just standing up and he's got his hand.

2891
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:19,750
He looks like he just stole second.
He's got his hands on his knees,

2892
02:08:19,751 --> 02:08:22,480
he's breathing heavy and shit is.
I'm like,

2893
02:08:22,620 --> 02:08:24,430
all right,
let's go get back inside.

2894
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:29,460
And I'm walking down the driveway and I
remember visually seeing that gust of

2895
02:08:30,101 --> 02:08:33,400
wind come around the corner of the house
and just plan itself in my fucking

2896
02:08:33,401 --> 02:08:35,230
chest.
So I get the shakes.

2897
02:08:35,231 --> 02:08:39,340
It's like two degrees outside when we go
in the house and we're just start

2898
02:08:39,341 --> 02:08:41,650
throwing thermals and shit on.
And as I'm doing,

2899
02:08:41,651 --> 02:08:43,570
I'm looking at him and I'm like,
hey man,

2900
02:08:43,571 --> 02:08:46,240
you don't look.
You don't look so good dude.

2901
02:08:46,241 --> 02:08:47,410
He's like,
oh,

2902
02:08:47,411 --> 02:08:49,690
he's touching himself in the mirror.
He's turning gray,

2903
02:08:49,691 --> 02:08:50,650
start sweating.
We're.

2904
02:08:50,651 --> 02:08:52,440
He's like,
I don't fucking feel good.

2905
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:54,280
I'm like,
go upstairs and get some water right

2906
02:08:54,281 --> 02:08:56,890
now.
And it progressed so quickly and he

2907
02:08:56,891 --> 02:09:00,010
looked like shit so bad that I'm over in
the mirror looking at myself.

2908
02:09:00,010 --> 02:09:01,180
Like I'm like,
I'm okay.

2909
02:09:01,181 --> 02:09:04,960
I'm fine.
I go out to come tell my cousin,

2910
02:09:04,961 --> 02:09:07,960
his sister what happens?
And there's a fireplace.

2911
02:09:07,961 --> 02:09:10,030
Fires going.
I'm sitting next to her and we're just

2912
02:09:10,031 --> 02:09:10,930
warming up.
And I'm like,

2913
02:09:11,470 --> 02:09:12,100
he goes,
what?

2914
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:12,933
She goes,
what the fuck?

2915
02:09:13,180 --> 02:09:14,170
My brother over there.
I go,

2916
02:09:14,171 --> 02:09:17,530
we just went out in the car.
We got high and he's fucking freaking

2917
02:09:17,531 --> 02:09:18,041
out.
She goes,

2918
02:09:18,041 --> 02:09:22,060
well,
there's 19 girls here and 17 of us are

2919
02:09:22,061 --> 02:09:23,530
tripping on acid right now.
I go,

2920
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:27,040
oh my God,
there's two girls.

2921
02:09:27,041 --> 02:09:29,480
Scared of the other groups were locked
in the bedroom.

2922
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:35,910
He comes back down the stairs and he's
just.

2923
02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:39,070
He's battling for life at this boy.
He's tried to get in the bathroom.

2924
02:09:39,071 --> 02:09:43,360
They think it's the girls on acid so
they're not letting anyone and he just

2925
02:09:43,361 --> 02:09:45,280
turns around and at the time we're
watching.

2926
02:09:45,290 --> 02:09:45,880
I'm like,
look at him,

2927
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:48,520
look at him now,
and he just takes two steps and he

2928
02:09:48,521 --> 02:09:52,810
stands erect and just rocks back and
goes face forward into the banister.

2929
02:09:52,811 --> 02:09:55,750
It cracks busted his face open.
He lays on the ground.

2930
02:09:55,751 --> 02:09:57,280
He starts having like a little seizure.
I'm like,

2931
02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:58,870
Oh my and I'm wearing you.
I'm like,

2932
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,280
oh my God,
I just fucking killed him.

2933
02:10:00,310 --> 02:10:03,960
Friday had just come out.
My cousin on point jumps on top of them.

2934
02:10:03,961 --> 02:10:05,770
It's like,
you got knocked the fuck out.

2935
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:08,240
They all start laughing.
I'm like this,

2936
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:10,360
by the way,
my aunt and uncle,

2937
02:10:10,361 --> 02:10:13,390
they're asleep upstairs and I'm like,
oh my God,

2938
02:10:13,391 --> 02:10:17,470
his eyes are rolling back in his head.
This one girl grabs the fucking phone to

2939
02:10:17,471 --> 02:10:19,450
call nine slash 11.
She hits nine.

2940
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:22,210
She hits one.
I'm already got his head tilted.

2941
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:25,810
I'm ready to go.
I'm very good in controlled chaos and

2942
02:10:25,811 --> 02:10:28,090
I'm just.
I'm about to fucking put my mouth.

2943
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:30,660
I can't believe I got to get my cousin
and they're all laughing.

2944
02:10:30,670 --> 02:10:31,740
They're on acid.
They don't.

2945
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:34,490
They think it's hilarious.
I go to put were about and he

2946
02:10:34,490 --> 02:10:35,390
goes,
get the fuck off me.

2947
02:10:35,391 --> 02:10:36,620
And I was like.
I was like,

2948
02:10:36,650 --> 02:10:37,351
Oh God.
I go,

2949
02:10:37,351 --> 02:10:40,220
what the fuck happened was I was,
I was locked inside myself.

2950
02:10:40,221 --> 02:10:42,710
I heard everything you said couldn't
respond though.

2951
02:10:42,711 --> 02:10:45,260
I heard everything right.
I was stuck inside myself.

2952
02:10:45,590 --> 02:10:49,610
He had come out now his teeth or through
his lip here because he's hit the

2953
02:10:49,611 --> 02:10:54,530
banister and the chicks on acid now see
the blood and now they start freaking

2954
02:10:54,531 --> 02:10:55,490
the fuck out.
I'm like,

2955
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:56,540
oh my God.
He's like,

2956
02:10:56,541 --> 02:11:00,440
you got to save it to the opposite.
17 girls have 19.

2957
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:02,630
I'm like,
I'm not taking him to the hospital,

2958
02:11:02,631 --> 02:11:06,080
we can't go to the hospital and tell
them we've got a bunch of kids on and

2959
02:11:06,150 --> 02:11:07,370
on.
I was like,

2960
02:11:07,371 --> 02:11:09,500
you just got to suck it up and tough it
out.

2961
02:11:09,501 --> 02:11:13,160
So he waited until the morning and got
my uncle because it just busted his lip

2962
02:11:13,161 --> 02:11:15,260
all up and he was like,
I just tripped down into steps and hit

2963
02:11:15,261 --> 02:11:17,720
the banister,
but that was the second time that we

2964
02:11:17,721 --> 02:11:18,680
almost killed his ass.

2965
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:21,140
He did a gravity bong one time out of
the kitchen sink.

2966
02:11:21,141 --> 02:11:22,580
I really thought he was going to die.
I'm like,

2967
02:11:22,581 --> 02:11:27,581
why would you ever touch weed again?
I was in New York film it fear factor

2968
02:11:28,390 --> 02:11:32,990
and I was with some friends that I don't
know if they get high and they

2969
02:11:32,991 --> 02:11:34,700
definitely don't get high on a regular
basis,

2970
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:38,120
but we're all having a good time.
We're at a bar and it's post nine slash

2971
02:11:38,121 --> 02:11:38,954
11.
Right.

2972
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:41,960
And so New York had a lively,
weird feel to it,

2973
02:11:41,961 --> 02:11:44,420
like a friendly feel to it.
It was very strange,

2974
02:11:44,421 --> 02:11:47,600
like after nine slash 11,
something happened in New York where it

2975
02:11:47,601 --> 02:11:51,170
was so devastated and horrible that in
the recovery process

2976
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:54,680
people are nicer to each other.
It was very strange.

2977
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:57,050
So anyway,
it was a friendly feeling.

2978
02:11:57,260 --> 02:11:59,750
So we're all sitting outside.
We're in this bar,

2979
02:11:59,810 --> 02:12:01,700
we're having a couple of drinks were,
you know,

2980
02:12:01,701 --> 02:12:04,850
it's right after filming,
I'm with the producers and a bunch of

2981
02:12:04,851 --> 02:12:06,910
the people that work on the show and we
go,

2982
02:12:07,130 --> 02:12:07,660
uh,
you know,

2983
02:12:07,660 --> 02:12:08,061
I go,
hey,

2984
02:12:08,061 --> 02:12:08,894
you guys want to get high?

2985
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:10,160
And they go,
yeah,

2986
02:12:10,430 --> 02:12:11,300
sure.
Yeah.

2987
02:12:11,301 --> 02:12:12,760
Okay,
so come on outside,

2988
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:15,800
let's go.
And I'm giving them that serious

2989
02:12:15,950 --> 02:12:19,580
California.
We'd some serious California weed.

2990
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:21,500
I don't remember what the name of it
was,

2991
02:12:21,501 --> 02:12:23,750
like whatever,
the jail break or whatever the fuck it

2992
02:12:23,751 --> 02:12:24,584
was called,
but it was,

2993
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:29,300
it was really strong.
We all take a hit of this joint.

2994
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:31,250
I take a hit,
I passed to my friend.

2995
02:12:31,251 --> 02:12:33,680
He takes a hit,
he passes it to this other guy and then

2996
02:12:33,681 --> 02:12:37,040
he passes it to my friend shy and she's
one of the producers on the show.

2997
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:41,090
She takes a hit of it and her eyes
rolled back inside of her head and her

2998
02:12:41,091 --> 02:12:44,100
knees buckle and then she just goes,
and this,

2999
02:12:44,130 --> 02:12:47,270
where on the street she dropped,
dropped,

3000
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:49,610
caught her.
I caught her just in time,

3001
02:12:50,090 --> 02:12:51,810
caught her.
And um,

3002
02:12:51,860 --> 02:12:52,450
you know,
we,

3003
02:12:52,450 --> 02:12:54,440
we had to call the fire department,
you know,

3004
02:12:54,441 --> 02:12:56,420
we call nine slash 11.
The fire department came and they

3005
02:12:56,421 --> 02:13:00,030
checked her out and you know,
they could probably smell we a Myra if

3006
02:13:00,240 --> 02:13:04,220
somebody ran over a fucking scar.
And they were like,

3007
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:05,061
hey man,
what are you doing?

3008
02:13:05,061 --> 02:13:05,421
I go,
yeah,

3009
02:13:05,421 --> 02:13:07,250
we're,
we're filming a fear factor here.

3010
02:13:07,251 --> 02:13:08,084
And uh,
you know,

3011
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:09,320
she just,
she got dizzy.

3012
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:10,020
He said,
oh,

3013
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:10,853
she got dizzy,
Huh?

3014
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:17,880
But just lucky we caught her man because
if we didn't catch her she was going to

3015
02:13:18,591 --> 02:13:21,230
bounce her head off the concrete.
I mean she just went limp.

3016
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:23,600
She just went like this,
like our eyes went back and just went

3017
02:13:23,601 --> 02:13:27,170
like this and I think it was me and my
friend Tom Wind up catching her,

3018
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:29,720
but it was um,
it was weird,

3019
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:32,100
like her body just shut off or bodies
like too

3020
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:33,720
much pot.
Fuck it.

3021
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:37,680
Like her body was more comfortable going
unconscious than it was dealing with

3022
02:13:37,681 --> 02:13:39,060
being that high.
That quick,

3023
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:41,800
tell me if you've ever heard this,
you'd be the person that asked.

3024
02:13:41,801 --> 02:13:44,430
So like,
I've never done acid coke.

3025
02:13:44,431 --> 02:13:45,160
I'm,
we'd,

3026
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:48,300
I've done ecstasy a couple of times.
Not For me.

3027
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:50,700
I've done shrooms a couple times where I
enjoyed it,

3028
02:13:50,701 --> 02:13:51,870
but after awhile I was like,
okay,

3029
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:53,340
get the fuck outta here.
You know what I mean?

3030
02:13:53,341 --> 02:13:54,360
Like,
it's enough,

3031
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:55,800
it's enough,
I get it.

3032
02:13:56,550 --> 02:13:59,610
But a friend of mine,
this was when I first moved out here,

3033
02:13:59,611 --> 02:14:03,990
we went and saw pink floyd at the Rose
Bowl and we take a bunch of weed and

3034
02:14:03,991 --> 02:14:06,390
some drinks and he's got a couple,
this guy and girl,

3035
02:14:06,391 --> 02:14:10,200
we're going to meet us there and she
brings shrooms and I'm just like,

3036
02:14:10,201 --> 02:14:11,280
I'm cool,
I'll pass.

3037
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:15,360
But the three of them do the shrooms and
we're in the middle of the concert and

3038
02:14:15,361 --> 02:14:19,560
fuck the pigs are inflated their balance
and we're having a great fucking time.

3039
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:24,330
And I looked to my left over here and I
looked back to my right and my friends

3040
02:14:24,331 --> 02:14:27,510
gone,
he's gone and I hear screams and I

3041
02:14:27,511 --> 02:14:32,511
looked
and I looked down and he's passed out.

3042
02:14:33,420 --> 02:14:34,800
Okay.
He's gone into a seizure.

3043
02:14:34,801 --> 02:14:38,310
So rose bowls,
the bleacher stadium seats.

3044
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:41,250
So He.
What happened was he fell back and his

3045
02:14:41,251 --> 02:14:43,950
feet got locked up under the bleachers
in front of him.

3046
02:14:43,951 --> 02:14:48,870
So he's bent completely like this and
these fucking idiots behind him.

3047
02:14:48,871 --> 02:14:50,640
I shouldn't say fucking idiots.
I don't blame them.

3048
02:14:50,641 --> 02:14:52,470
They got scared instead of catching
them,

3049
02:14:52,471 --> 02:14:55,440
they moved out of the way.
So his head strikes the bleachers and he

3050
02:14:55,441 --> 02:14:58,470
starts going into a seizure.
And I'm like,

3051
02:14:58,740 --> 02:15:00,360
I've never seen anybody do this from
terms.

3052
02:15:00,361 --> 02:15:02,100
And they're all yelling,
is he epileptic?

3053
02:15:02,190 --> 02:15:03,960
I said,
I don't know anything.

3054
02:15:04,230 --> 02:15:08,100
The girl that gave them to him,
she saw it and she just immediately had

3055
02:15:08,101 --> 02:15:08,490
the.

3056
02:15:08,490 --> 02:15:11,440
She started vomiting in her like $45
concert shirts.

3057
02:15:11,441 --> 02:15:14,760
She just heard trip went south
immediately and I did not.

3058
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:17,130
I didn't know what to do and I just
fucking punched,

3059
02:15:18,980 --> 02:15:22,380
punched the shit out of it.
It's in his face bro,

3060
02:15:22,381 --> 02:15:25,110
right across the jaw and he woke up and
he's like,

3061
02:15:25,111 --> 02:15:26,370
what the fuck happened?
I was like,

3062
02:15:26,371 --> 02:15:28,170
you just passed out and had a seizure.
He's like,

3063
02:15:28,171 --> 02:15:29,130
how long was I out?
It was like,

3064
02:15:29,190 --> 02:15:30,780
how long do you think you were out?
And he's like,

3065
02:15:30,781 --> 02:15:31,561
two minutes.
I was like,

3066
02:15:31,561 --> 02:15:33,090
is about 15 seconds dude.
And he's like,

3067
02:15:33,091 --> 02:15:35,880
Holy Shit.
And then he was fine after that,

3068
02:15:35,881 --> 02:15:37,410
but I've never seen that.
Yeah.

3069
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:41,460
I don't know if the head striking the
bleachers what caused the seizure or.

3070
02:15:41,730 --> 02:15:44,700
But he just had this moment where he
just passed out from shrooms.

3071
02:15:44,701 --> 02:15:47,130
I've never seen that before.
It does happen.

3072
02:15:47,130 --> 02:15:49,890
People get knocked out and the seizure,
that does happen.

3073
02:15:49,891 --> 02:15:52,140
I've seen that before.
Their toes lockup up.

3074
02:15:53,010 --> 02:15:55,340
People get punched and knocked out the
toes,

3075
02:15:55,341 --> 02:15:59,280
lock up whole body like I know about the
arms that go up like this,

3076
02:15:59,810 --> 02:16:03,870
that this shit's dangerous.
This extended just extend.

3077
02:16:03,871 --> 02:16:08,070
It happens all the time and fights.
I have the weirdest thing,

3078
02:16:08,071 --> 02:16:10,050
this,
this make me laugh.

3079
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:11,880
Just the weirdest thing I've ever seen
on weed,

3080
02:16:11,881 --> 02:16:12,900
you know,
smoking weed.

3081
02:16:12,901 --> 02:16:15,550
So I'm a Oreo Fan.
I'm a ravens fan.

3082
02:16:15,551 --> 02:16:20,160
And back in the day I'd go to Anaheim by
myself to see the orioles play the

3083
02:16:20,161 --> 02:16:23,910
angels and just nothing was built around
there.

3084
02:16:23,911 --> 02:16:26,800
Then it's a dirt lot.
I go by a scout ticket,

3085
02:16:26,801 --> 02:16:28,470
uh,
a single from this dude.

3086
02:16:28,471 --> 02:16:29,980
And then I'd go the street

3087
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:33,940
to like $4 parking in were like,
it's a business complex,

3088
02:16:33,941 --> 02:16:35,530
like La dwp.
They're all in there,

3089
02:16:35,531 --> 02:16:38,980
but the buildings are in a square and
the parking's all in the middle and it's

3090
02:16:38,981 --> 02:16:41,410
just me and a friend of mine one time,
he's like,

3091
02:16:41,411 --> 02:16:42,600
hey,
he's a cubs fan.

3092
02:16:42,610 --> 02:16:45,370
He's like,
I know you're going to go to the game

3093
02:16:45,371 --> 02:16:46,210
today.
I love baseball.

3094
02:16:46,211 --> 02:16:47,620
You mind if I roll with you?
I'm like,

3095
02:16:47,621 --> 02:16:49,030
Nah man,
let's go do it together.

3096
02:16:49,031 --> 02:16:51,160
So we'd go out and it's early know it's
a 1:00 game.

3097
02:16:51,161 --> 02:16:55,300
So we're getting out there like 11 and
the two of us are sitting in the middle

3098
02:16:55,301 --> 02:16:58,610
of this empty parking lot of hundreds of
spaces were smoke.

3099
02:16:58,611 --> 02:17:00,360
We got sand chairs,
mogen joins,

3100
02:17:00,370 --> 02:17:01,570
drinking a little beer in the parking
lot,

3101
02:17:01,571 --> 02:17:06,571
tailgating before we go into the game,
like 150 yards down this corner,

3102
02:17:07,300 --> 02:17:10,270
this fucking pickup truck hops the curb.

3103
02:17:10,810 --> 02:17:14,140
And I mean like a hundred miles an hour
is gunning right at us.

3104
02:17:14,141 --> 02:17:14,710
That,
you know,

3105
02:17:14,710 --> 02:17:15,700
again,
with your friends,

3106
02:17:15,701 --> 02:17:17,560
it happened so quick.
We're like grip our chairs like the

3107
02:17:17,561 --> 02:17:19,000
fuck's going on and it,
you know,

3108
02:17:19,001 --> 02:17:20,950
those uh,
those cadillac commercials,

3109
02:17:20,951 --> 02:17:23,950
the on the dry lake beds,
but the mirage and it's humming right at

3110
02:17:23,951 --> 02:17:25,210
you.
That's what this fucking thing looks

3111
02:17:25,211 --> 02:17:27,940
like.
And it's a big ass truck and it pulls up

3112
02:17:27,950 --> 02:17:32,250
and it parks like,
just for spaces to our lift this

3113
02:17:32,530 --> 02:17:34,720
hundreds of spaces and we're looking at
you like,

3114
02:17:34,721 --> 02:17:38,560
what the fuck?
This lady gets out and she's like,

3115
02:17:38,561 --> 02:17:40,840
what's up?
What's up?

3116
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:45,550
And she pops the tailgate down and it's
all happening so fast is obviously her

3117
02:17:45,551 --> 02:17:47,350
shit because she's just fluid doing
everything.

3118
02:17:47,351 --> 02:17:49,030
She grabs thing,
snaps it open,

3119
02:17:49,031 --> 02:17:50,320
it's a big ass wheelchair.
I'm like,

3120
02:17:50,321 --> 02:17:53,230
what the fuck is going on?
She goes over to the passenger door.

3121
02:17:53,230 --> 02:17:57,400
She opens the door up and she gets her
friend out who doesn't have legs and

3122
02:17:57,401 --> 02:17:59,830
we're like,
what the fuck is happening right now?

3123
02:17:59,831 --> 02:18:01,720
She sets her friend in the wheelchair
and she's like,

3124
02:18:01,930 --> 02:18:03,340
you guys got weed?
You got beer.

3125
02:18:03,341 --> 02:18:05,140
We got fucking Jello shots.
Let's do it.

3126
02:18:05,141 --> 02:18:07,190
We partied.
Our Lady.

3127
02:18:07,990 --> 02:18:09,070
I was so high.
I was like,

3128
02:18:09,071 --> 02:18:11,170
is there something to know out of
nowhere,

3129
02:18:11,171 --> 02:18:14,530
dude just decided to party with you.
We're pulling in here.

3130
02:18:14,531 --> 02:18:15,820
You're here,
we're here,

3131
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:17,920
she doesn't have legs.
We're fucking doing this.

3132
02:18:17,921 --> 02:18:19,090
And we were like,
Holy Shit.

3133
02:18:19,091 --> 02:18:21,100
They had gel.
They were the nicest colon.

3134
02:18:21,130 --> 02:18:22,730
Everyone knew her.
You know,

3135
02:18:22,750 --> 02:18:23,680
she was a role.
They're like,

3136
02:18:23,681 --> 02:18:28,410
what's up?
She's sticking shit under her blankets.

3137
02:18:30,790 --> 02:18:31,850
I was like,
it's the weirdest shit.

3138
02:18:31,851 --> 02:18:34,480
I think I've ever seen what I've been
smoking for a water right there.

3139
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:37,270
Well,
once you're partying is happening,

3140
02:18:37,271 --> 02:18:40,150
the normal rules of life kind of go out
the window.

3141
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:43,810
The weird shit happens,
but I'm a guy.

3142
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:46,030
I liked the story,
like I wasn't going to be like,

3143
02:18:46,031 --> 02:18:47,500
let's pack our shit up and get the fuck
out of here.

3144
02:18:47,501 --> 02:18:49,480
I was like,
let's stay here and party with these two

3145
02:18:49,550 --> 02:18:53,930
doesn't seem too dangerous to ladies.
One of them got no legs when they were

3146
02:18:54,010 --> 02:18:55,570
for cyber was.
She was a credit.

3147
02:18:55,571 --> 02:18:56,890
So that.
But what she told me,

3148
02:18:56,891 --> 02:18:58,030
she's like,
you got to Cherokee.

3149
02:18:58,150 --> 02:18:59,290
I go,
how'd you get in down there?

3150
02:18:59,291 --> 02:19:00,730
She goes,
you can hop the curb down there and

3151
02:19:00,731 --> 02:19:03,010
parked back here for free.
I did that for two more seasons.

3152
02:19:03,011 --> 02:19:05,260
All that off the tip of her.
Oh,

3153
02:19:05,610 --> 02:19:08,080
she just big enough.
She was right because she has a four

3154
02:19:08,081 --> 02:19:10,250
wheel drive.
Pop it right over the curb and go,

3155
02:19:11,110 --> 02:19:12,600
Shit.
Clever lady.

3156
02:19:15,490 --> 02:19:16,690
Yeah,
partying.

3157
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:19,180
It's not good for you,
but it makes good God damn memories.

3158
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:23,260
I remember it took me when I first
started,

3159
02:19:23,350 --> 02:19:26,380
I was a late bloomer on weed.
I was 21 when I started smoking.

3160
02:19:26,381 --> 02:19:27,580
I was 30.
Yeah.

3161
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:28,423
You were like,

3162
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:29,773
and I,
I.

3163
02:19:29,780 --> 02:19:30,950
It took me a month,
like I,

3164
02:19:31,170 --> 02:19:34,370
I was ignorant to the whole idea of just
having to learn how to smoke,

3165
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:37,090
how to take smoke into my lungs,
you know,

3166
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:39,490
just that you don't.
I didn't even dawn on me and I would

3167
02:19:39,491 --> 02:19:40,030
just be like,
oh,

3168
02:19:40,030 --> 02:19:41,540
just take it in.
I won't call for anything.

3169
02:19:41,541 --> 02:19:46,070
So it took like a month before I got
high and the first time I got high I

3170
02:19:46,071 --> 02:19:48,710
remember freaking the fuck out and I was
trying to talk myself through it.

3171
02:19:48,711 --> 02:19:49,544
Like,
it's a plant,

3172
02:19:49,790 --> 02:19:51,840
you can't overdose unless you smoke your
body weight.

3173
02:19:51,841 --> 02:19:54,260
At least I heard that one time.
I don't know if that's even a newborn.

3174
02:19:54,261 --> 02:19:56,150
Preemie can't do it.
I'm saying this shit to myself,

3175
02:19:56,151 --> 02:20:01,151
but I kept asking questions out loud
like you guys hear my heartbeat and I

3176
02:20:01,700 --> 02:20:02,690
was so scared.
I was like,

3177
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:03,790
I'm dying and no one's

3178
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:04,741
that.
Get me to the hospital.

3179
02:20:04,741 --> 02:20:06,020
It's got a fucked up guys.
They were like,

3180
02:20:06,021 --> 02:20:07,940
shut the fuck up.
Go downstairs dude.

3181
02:20:07,941 --> 02:20:11,370
You're brand new.
My step dad smoked weed and we stole it

3182
02:20:11,371 --> 02:20:15,680
once when I was in high school and me
and my girlfriend and my friend Josh

3183
02:20:15,681 --> 02:20:19,310
smoked pot over my girlfriend's house
and we were

3184
02:20:21,110 --> 02:20:23,950
16,
I think I was 16.

3185
02:20:23,970 --> 02:20:28,970
My girlfriend was 15 and we got so high
that we would wake up in the kitchen and

3186
02:20:29,971 --> 02:20:33,330
then wake up in the living room.
Like we would miss time.

3187
02:20:33,570 --> 02:20:35,880
We'd be missing spots.
Like how did we get here?

3188
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:39,690
Like I never forget that.
Like when you're 16 you don't really get

3189
02:20:39,691 --> 02:20:42,300
paranoid because you're not worried too
much about stuff.

3190
02:20:42,301 --> 02:20:45,280
You too stupid.
Your brain has a fully formed yet,

3191
02:20:45,480 --> 02:20:47,730
you know,
and I didn't really understand pot.

3192
02:20:47,731 --> 02:20:50,670
I have no idea how much we smoked.
We just kept smoking it,

3193
02:20:50,880 --> 02:20:52,920
you know,
when you're 16 you don't know to stop,

3194
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:56,970
you just keep smoking.
And I just remember like my whole body

3195
02:20:57,240 --> 02:21:02,160
was tingling and were like lying on the
couch together and we couldn't move or

3196
02:21:02,161 --> 02:21:02,971
like,
oh my God,

3197
02:21:02,971 --> 02:21:04,710
I can't move.
Then all of a sudden we were in the

3198
02:21:04,711 --> 02:21:06,570
kitchen stand in front of refrigerator.

3199
02:21:08,390 --> 02:21:09,223
Yeah.

3200
02:21:10,660 --> 02:21:14,160
Oh we were too high.
We just didn't know what we had no idea

3201
02:21:14,161 --> 02:21:15,840
what was happening.
That's the.

3202
02:21:15,870 --> 02:21:19,740
That's the one thing that's cool about
getting people that don't get high as

3203
02:21:19,741 --> 02:21:24,060
you get to see that overwhelming rush
where they don't really know what this

3204
02:21:24,061 --> 02:21:25,800
is or what to do.
Right.

3205
02:21:26,010 --> 02:21:30,420
Chris Mcguire,
I got him high once you know Chris?

3206
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:31,380
No.
Standup comic.

3207
02:21:31,440 --> 02:21:33,870
Funny Guy.
He's produces a bunch of TV shows now.

3208
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,760
He's one of the.
He produces,

3209
02:21:35,790 --> 02:21:37,830
I think he's the executive producer of
that.

3210
02:21:38,070 --> 02:21:42,810
Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart.
Anyway,

3211
02:21:43,690 --> 02:21:45,620
got them high and he's like,
I think there's something else in his

3212
02:21:45,621 --> 02:21:47,240
body.
I think there's something else in it.

3213
02:21:47,250 --> 02:21:47,601
No,
no.

3214
02:21:47,601 --> 02:21:49,180
It's just.
That's what pots like today.

3215
02:21:49,190 --> 02:21:49,601
He's like,
no,

3216
02:21:49,601 --> 02:21:50,140
no,
no,

3217
02:21:50,140 --> 02:21:50,341
no,
no,

3218
02:21:50,341 --> 02:21:51,290
no.
This isn't pot.

3219
02:21:51,410 --> 02:21:52,730
Instant pot.
This is more than pot.

3220
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:53,480
Like,
no,

3221
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:55,330
this is pot.
This is what pot is now.

3222
02:21:55,580 --> 02:21:58,440
Pod is now a different thing.
It's like you go Italy,

3223
02:21:58,570 --> 02:22:00,530
you go back to some pot from the 19
sixties.

3224
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:01,940
Those hippies,
they didn't know what the fuck.

3225
02:22:01,941 --> 02:22:06,830
There's no smoking bullshit.
Today's scientifically organized.

3226
02:22:07,070 --> 02:22:10,670
So my uncle,
he's in his eighties who's got stage

3227
02:22:10,671 --> 02:22:11,570
four cancer.
He's,

3228
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:13,880
he's on his way out and he's not eating
at all,

3229
02:22:13,881 --> 02:22:16,400
so a couple of weeks now.
He hasn't had a bite to eat like two

3230
02:22:16,401 --> 02:22:18,770
weeks and my cousin takes care of him
and he's like,

3231
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:21,560
I think in about giving them weed and
like give him,

3232
02:22:21,561 --> 02:22:24,020
we'd give it to him.
He's fucking 80 couple years old.

3233
02:22:24,021 --> 02:22:26,040
He's got stage.
What does it matter at this point?

3234
02:22:26,041 --> 02:22:28,260
Like heroin,
get whatever the fuck he wants to put

3235
02:22:28,261 --> 02:22:29,820
him at rest.
He's like,

3236
02:22:29,821 --> 02:22:30,940
I think I'm going to give him weed.
I'm like,

3237
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:33,030
let them smoke some.
He used to smoke a pipe,

3238
02:22:33,031 --> 02:22:36,030
let them smoke a little bit.
So he goes down and he gives him some

3239
02:22:36,031 --> 02:22:38,060
weed and he smokes it.
And um,

3240
02:22:38,220 --> 02:22:39,600
he's like,
I'm just going to stay here with you for

3241
02:22:39,601 --> 02:22:42,960
a few hours and few hours go by.

3242
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:43,621
He's like,
how do you feel?

3243
02:22:43,621 --> 02:22:44,910
Is like,
I don't really feel anything but I'm

3244
02:22:44,911 --> 02:22:46,110
tired.
I think I'm going to go to bed.

3245
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:49,450
And the next day my cousin goes back to
see him with some more weed and he's

3246
02:22:49,470 --> 02:22:50,340
like,
how was last night?

3247
02:22:50,341 --> 02:22:52,140
He goes,
I didn't feel weird.

3248
02:22:52,141 --> 02:22:55,170
He goes,
but I slept like a baby and he's like,

3249
02:22:55,171 --> 02:22:55,801
alright,
good,

3250
02:22:55,801 --> 02:22:57,060
let's,
let's try this again.

3251
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:59,400
Day to not eating after almost two
weeks,

3252
02:22:59,401 --> 02:23:03,240
nothing smokes weed,
and he's sitting with them for a couple

3253
02:23:03,241 --> 02:23:03,781
of hours.
He's like,

3254
02:23:03,781 --> 02:23:04,840
how do you feel good,
you know,

3255
02:23:05,550 --> 02:23:09,120
I think I could ate and he ate a plate
of Spaghetti and meatballs,

3256
02:23:09,121 --> 02:23:12,600
heavy ass meatballs,
boom on day two from smoking marijuana.

3257
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:15,690
And I was like,
keep going because Maryland's way

3258
02:23:15,691 --> 02:23:17,400
behind.
I think they finally just have their

3259
02:23:17,401 --> 02:23:22,401
first and only a legal dispensary and
he's the prime candidate for that shit.

3260
02:23:23,131 --> 02:23:24,000
You know what I mean?
I'm like,

3261
02:23:24,001 --> 02:23:28,230
go get him a prescription now and just
let him smoke himself on the way out.

3262
02:23:28,430 --> 02:23:31,400
That's one of the saddest things about
it being illegal and stigmatized for so

3263
02:23:31,401 --> 02:23:33,510
long.
The so many people with diseases and

3264
02:23:34,100 --> 02:23:36,350
arthritis,
inflammation,

3265
02:23:36,410 --> 02:23:38,780
all sorts of problems that had just been
just,

3266
02:23:39,380 --> 02:23:41,540
you know,
just told that they can't,

3267
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:43,940
you know,
they can't have this one thing that's

3268
02:23:43,941 --> 02:23:46,280
going to give them relief and it's not
hurting anybody.

3269
02:23:46,310 --> 02:23:47,143
It's just a plant.

3270
02:23:47,540 --> 02:23:49,910
I got some cbd cream on my back right
now.

3271
02:23:49,911 --> 02:23:51,830
Phone works.
It's phenomenal.

3272
02:23:52,070 --> 02:23:53,930
That's stuff's amazing.
I can't even get over it.

3273
02:23:53,931 --> 02:23:57,320
No side effects.
I'm new to the CBD side of it and I'm

3274
02:23:57,321 --> 02:23:58,160
just like,
man,

3275
02:23:58,161 --> 02:23:59,420
it really fucking works.

3276
02:23:59,510 --> 02:24:02,540
Can I carry this shit with me?
Right in the fanny pack.

3277
02:24:02,541 --> 02:24:04,990
I got this liberty lotion,
this stuff right here.

3278
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:06,390
Oh yeah.
I love that stuff.

3279
02:24:07,410 --> 02:24:11,300
I started using it when I was.
I had some tendinitis that's heel that

3280
02:24:11,310 --> 02:24:13,470
since,
but I had some tendonitis in my elbow

3281
02:24:13,500 --> 02:24:14,640
when I started using that and I was
like,

3282
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:16,140
Ooh,
how many times a week?

3283
02:24:16,590 --> 02:24:19,230
Whenever you can use it,
whenever it doesn't hurt and the next

3284
02:24:19,230 --> 02:24:21,300
day you feel pretty quick.
You feel real quick.

3285
02:24:21,330 --> 02:24:23,440
I feel this pretty quickly.
Yeah.

3286
02:24:23,510 --> 02:24:27,030
I had a bit of a pulled muscle and the
outside of my hip and it was real stiff

3287
02:24:27,031 --> 02:24:29,400
and it was bothering me.
I put some in that shit on before I went

3288
02:24:29,401 --> 02:24:30,500
to bed.
I woke up in the morning.

3289
02:24:30,530 --> 02:24:32,250
I was like,
what did it go away?

3290
02:24:32,460 --> 02:24:34,890
It was weird.
I went to bed but it was aching and I

3291
02:24:34,891 --> 02:24:36,090
woke up in the morning.
Nothing.

3292
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:38,850
Yeah,
just slather that stuff all up on there.

3293
02:24:38,851 --> 02:24:41,240
It just reduces inflammation.
I'm going to write that one down.

3294
02:24:41,250 --> 02:24:43,220
And here's the thing is one of my
sponsors here.

3295
02:24:43,340 --> 02:24:44,260
You can have that one.
Thank you.

3296
02:24:44,261 --> 02:24:45,720
Have that.
And here's the thing.

3297
02:24:45,721 --> 02:24:47,580
It doesn't,
it doesn't hurt anybody.

3298
02:24:47,610 --> 02:24:48,443
It's,
there's no,

3299
02:24:48,450 --> 02:24:50,370
there's no negative side effects.
Nothing.

3300
02:24:51,340 --> 02:24:53,430
High gang of that shit.
I got a bunch of those.

3301
02:24:53,431 --> 02:24:54,264
I wish I had more.

3302
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:56,340
I love.
I mean I'm so new to.

3303
02:24:56,350 --> 02:25:01,350
I went and got this one that was um,
like super strings and man,

3304
02:25:01,610 --> 02:25:04,010
I couldn't believe it.
I couldn't believe I had a rough patch

3305
02:25:04,011 --> 02:25:04,761
on an elbow.
I was like,

3306
02:25:04,761 --> 02:25:07,130
I'm just going to say that shit was
calling it a day

3307
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:08,150
that day.
Yeah.

3308
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:09,500
Yeah.
It's great.

3309
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:12,230
Well,
any sort of inflammation diseases,

3310
02:25:12,231 --> 02:25:15,110
like people that have like sore joints
and you know,

3311
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:17,720
problems with muscles,
that stuff's amazing.

3312
02:25:17,721 --> 02:25:20,690
It just loosens you up and it doesn't
hurt you.

3313
02:25:20,691 --> 02:25:22,730
It doesn't fuck you up.
It doesn't get you high.

3314
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:26,230
You feel exactly the same and some
people will take it orally.

3315
02:25:26,770 --> 02:25:29,380
I take it orally occasionally,
but most of the time I just rub it on

3316
02:25:29,620 --> 02:25:31,810
any part that's sore,
but when you take it orally,

3317
02:25:31,811 --> 02:25:34,390
like people,
they find that it relieves anxiety,

3318
02:25:34,790 --> 02:25:37,240
it helps them relax and it doesn't fuck
you up,

3319
02:25:37,241 --> 02:25:39,130
but you can drive.
It's not like you're high,

3320
02:25:39,131 --> 02:25:41,380
you're paranoid.
It just chills you out a little bit.

3321
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:45,250
Just calms you down.
I just got a CBD vape pen.

3322
02:25:45,251 --> 02:25:49,660
I've tried the vape so the vape pens
don't work well for me.

3323
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:53,230
The marijuana,
once I plant works well for my system.

3324
02:25:53,650 --> 02:25:55,840
Even edibles don't really.
I took two stars.

3325
02:25:55,841 --> 02:25:59,230
A death in front of Joey Diaz didn't do
a damn thing to you.

3326
02:25:59,260 --> 02:26:00,670
This fucking guy,
he.

3327
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:01,630
He's.
He doesn't get.

3328
02:26:01,631 --> 02:26:02,710
Hi,
it's Jamie.

3329
02:26:02,740 --> 02:26:05,590
Jamie has one of those weird bodies
where he can eat like,

3330
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:07,750
what's the most amount of edibles you've
ever eaten?

3331
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:09,690
Thirteen hundred milligrams.
Jesus.

3332
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:10,600
See,
that's what.

3333
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:13,960
Here's what I feel like.
I feel like I would have to figure out

3334
02:26:14,530 --> 02:26:18,190
what that number is.
Go past that point and then dial it back

3335
02:26:18,191 --> 02:26:20,500
from there and I don't really want to go
past that fucking point,

3336
02:26:20,501 --> 02:26:22,870
you know,
1300 and saying I was trying to test to

3337
02:26:22,871 --> 02:26:27,130
see what a tip to.
But that's what I don't know that I did.

3338
02:26:27,131 --> 02:26:30,940
I'm sure I did a little bit.
Obviously I had to have like I did it

3339
02:26:30,941 --> 02:26:32,980
again.
I took a thousand and played video games

3340
02:26:32,981 --> 02:26:34,710
and like five hours in.

3341
02:26:34,710 --> 02:26:36,490
It was just,
it was really tough to play games.

3342
02:26:36,491 --> 02:26:37,510
I just like,
I didn't care,

3343
02:26:37,511 --> 02:26:40,600
I didn't want to sit there anymore so
it's hard to keep my attention on it.

3344
02:26:40,870 --> 02:26:44,410
So it obviously worked at some point but
it wasn't free.

3345
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:46,570
I wasn't freaking out or anything.
Like you describe.

3346
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:50,230
I can't take more than a hundred.
I go into the hundreds and I started

3347
02:26:50,231 --> 02:26:55,231
getting weirded out.
Like I like I'm a 25 to 50 milligram guy

3348
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:57,160
because it gives me a little little
high.

3349
02:26:57,161 --> 02:27:00,070
Just get a little high and I'm fine.
Unless I want to go into the tank,

3350
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:02,320
I'll go,
I'll take 100 and going in the tank,

3351
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:07,800
but when I get in there and
lied to and I stopped thinking,

3352
02:27:07,841 --> 02:27:10,420
I literally start thinking about things
I did when I was 14.

3353
02:27:10,421 --> 02:27:12,250
Like why did I say that?
Why did I do that?

3354
02:27:12,251 --> 02:27:13,120
Like,
hey man,

3355
02:27:13,121 --> 02:27:13,960
forgive yourself.

3356
02:27:14,050 --> 02:27:15,820
You were 14.
Stop beating yourself up.

3357
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:19,150
You're 40,
but I literally will think about stupid

3358
02:27:19,151 --> 02:27:21,200
shit that I did when I was a little kid.
It's,

3359
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:25,090
it's so it just,
it forces you to examine anything in

3360
02:27:25,091 --> 02:27:27,490
your life that you might have pushed
aside,

3361
02:27:28,140 --> 02:27:31,750
like you have to come to grips and make
restitution and figure out what the fuck

3362
02:27:31,751 --> 02:27:36,370
you did that for and why did you have
those thoughts and why'd you behave that

3363
02:27:36,371 --> 02:27:38,890
way and you know,
how are you different now and how have

3364
02:27:38,891 --> 02:27:42,010
you grown past that?
That's the thing about marijuana that

3365
02:27:42,011 --> 02:27:43,750
it's really highlight.
It's a,

3366
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:48,660
there's a lot of it.
People say it makes you paranoid and it

3367
02:27:48,670 --> 02:27:51,280
certainly does,
but I think a lot of what that is is

3368
02:27:51,281 --> 02:27:54,310
just making you aware of things you're
trying to.

3369
02:27:54,311 --> 02:27:57,040
Not think about it,
it's convenient for you in normal life

3370
02:27:57,041 --> 02:28:00,190
to not think about those things,
but as soon as you get high on marijuana

3371
02:28:00,191 --> 02:28:01,024
is like,
hey,

3372
02:28:01,030 --> 02:28:03,820
there's some shit that's bothering you
and you're not even thinking about it.

3373
02:28:03,970 --> 02:28:05,830
He'd come with me,
we go to the back of your head and I'm

3374
02:28:05,831 --> 02:28:08,470
going to shine a light on this.
Look at all this stuff.

3375
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:10,510
What are you gonna do with that dress?
This motherfucker?

3376
02:28:10,511 --> 02:28:13,090
How much you clean this shit up?
Yeah,

3377
02:28:13,540 --> 02:28:14,950
those pens.
Do you like them?

3378
02:28:14,951 --> 02:28:16,600
Have you tried them?
I have,

3379
02:28:16,810 --> 02:28:18,470
I'm not a fan.
Um,

3380
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:18,950
I,
I,

3381
02:28:18,950 --> 02:28:22,010
I occasionally will use a pen,
but I prefer

3382
02:28:22,430 --> 02:28:24,650
smoking joints.
That's what I liked it.

3383
02:28:24,950 --> 02:28:26,040
Yeah,
that's it.

3384
02:28:26,050 --> 02:28:26,883
I,
um,

3385
02:28:27,320 --> 02:28:30,410
so when from time to time I'll clean out
my,

3386
02:28:30,411 --> 02:28:33,170
just my place.
I believe in just getting cluttered

3387
02:28:33,171 --> 02:28:36,080
opens up so many different avenues to
bring other things in.

3388
02:28:36,081 --> 02:28:39,380
So I instead of just throwing it all
away,

3389
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:42,470
I make a game out of it.
So I go out to the Pasadena Rose Bowl

3390
02:28:42,471 --> 02:28:46,020
and I just sell my shit.
I just sit there in a parking space in

3391
02:28:46,021 --> 02:28:50,240
half by myself.
And I fucking sell garbage and my goal

3392
02:28:50,660 --> 02:28:54,290
every time is to sell everything.
Whatever I don't sell,

3393
02:28:54,291 --> 02:28:56,150
I swing by goodwill,
I'd donate it,

3394
02:28:56,151 --> 02:28:58,580
and then I'm out of there.
How much have you made doing that?

3395
02:28:59,050 --> 02:29:01,460
Well,
as I would average 350 bucks,

3396
02:29:01,461 --> 02:29:03,760
which is solid.
Four or five hour day out there,

3397
02:29:03,770 --> 02:29:05,270
having fun,
just yelling at people,

3398
02:29:05,271 --> 02:29:07,190
watching the goofs because you see a lot
of.

3399
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:10,340
It's interesting.
It's a weird social experiment because

3400
02:29:10,341 --> 02:29:15,341
you see the people that are addicts to
whatever it is,

3401
02:29:15,770 --> 02:29:17,150
shoes,
belts,

3402
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:18,200
leather,
whatever.

3403
02:29:18,201 --> 02:29:21,650
Then you see people who are addicted to
the sale.

3404
02:29:21,940 --> 02:29:23,780
Oh,
that's just too good to pass up.

3405
02:29:23,781 --> 02:29:26,060
I don't need that fucking iron,
but it's fifty cents.

3406
02:29:26,090 --> 02:29:27,980
I'm buying that motherfucker.
You know what I mean?

3407
02:29:27,981 --> 02:29:28,791
And you're like,
wow.

3408
02:29:28,791 --> 02:29:30,860
So you see,
you're like,

3409
02:29:30,890 --> 02:29:31,311
oh,
okay.

3410
02:29:31,311 --> 02:29:33,890
You really like,
you want all my leather goods?

3411
02:29:33,891 --> 02:29:35,630
You know,
they'll come run into you for musical

3412
02:29:35,631 --> 02:29:38,660
instruments in jeans or the.
That's the first wave of people they're

3413
02:29:38,661 --> 02:29:40,580
sprinting through.
You have jj musical instruments.

3414
02:29:41,210 --> 02:29:43,520
So I just take shit.
My average was 300 bucks.

3415
02:29:43,521 --> 02:29:45,500
I was my,
my daughter's mother.

3416
02:29:45,501 --> 02:29:46,340
And we were,
I was like,

3417
02:29:46,341 --> 02:29:47,660
I'm just going to sell all our shit and
she's like,

3418
02:29:47,661 --> 02:29:49,250
you're not going to make a lot of money.
I'm like,

3419
02:29:49,490 --> 02:29:50,870
I'll make at least 350 bucks.

3420
02:29:50,870 --> 02:29:53,150
It's a fun day.
Throw toward some baby stuff,

3421
02:29:53,151 --> 02:29:56,810
you know.
So I go out and you got to get out there

3422
02:29:56,811 --> 02:29:58,730
before the sun's up,
you know,

3423
02:29:58,731 --> 02:30:01,130
and,
and you've got all kinds of people out

3424
02:30:01,131 --> 02:30:03,260
there.
They're praying to Mecca before the sun

3425
02:30:03,261 --> 02:30:04,220
comes up and shit.
You're like,

3426
02:30:04,221 --> 02:30:07,340
wow,
this is a whole universe of different

3427
02:30:07,341 --> 02:30:08,900
fucking people,
not only the sellers,

3428
02:30:08,901 --> 02:30:10,430
the buyers.
And this is the Rose Bowl,

3429
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:13,260
the rose bowl,
always second Sunday of every month yet,

3430
02:30:13,460 --> 02:30:15,560
what do they call it?
Pasedena flea market.

3431
02:30:15,650 --> 02:30:17,690
And it's at the Rose Bowl.
Do you have to have a license?

3432
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:22,070
You buy a permit and basically your park
at your space as a parking space in a

3433
02:30:22,071 --> 02:30:23,120
half.
That's all you get.

3434
02:30:23,121 --> 02:30:25,070
It's narrow.
So people are right on top of you.

3435
02:30:25,460 --> 02:30:28,860
So I pull the truck in and then I just
set everything up behind it so I can

3436
02:30:28,861 --> 02:30:31,240
chill on the truck and I,
I just put blankets down.

3437
02:30:31,250 --> 02:30:33,620
I'm like black and I just start yelling
everything.

3438
02:30:33,640 --> 02:30:38,140
Like God got cds,
people still need to set up,

3439
02:30:38,250 --> 02:30:39,110
ready to do it.
Now

3440
02:30:41,160 --> 02:30:44,750
it's so much fucking fun.
So I get out in the lane and also play a

3441
02:30:44,751 --> 02:30:47,120
game to a friend of mine.
He would go once in a while and I'm

3442
02:30:47,121 --> 02:30:47,954
like,
alright,

3443
02:30:47,960 --> 02:30:51,470
let's pick the fucking item.
You should never be able to sell,

3444
02:30:51,471 --> 02:30:56,471
but our goal is you got to fucking sell.
And we had had a vhs self prostate exam

3445
02:30:56,840 --> 02:30:58,700
of vhs cassette and I was like,
I'm going to sell this.

3446
02:30:58,701 --> 02:31:00,200
He's like,
you're definitely not going to sell that

3447
02:31:00,201 --> 02:31:03,140
today.
And I packaged it with a little roll

3448
02:31:03,141 --> 02:31:06,020
away and I was like,
by the way is a hilarious father's day

3449
02:31:06,021 --> 02:31:06,710
prank.
She's like,

3450
02:31:06,710 --> 02:31:07,600
that's great.
How much?

3451
02:31:07,601 --> 02:31:09,020
I was like a buck bought it,
boom,

3452
02:31:09,440 --> 02:31:12,970
but I just get out there and I yell
because I sold a leather jacket,

3453
02:31:12,971 --> 02:31:14,360
a nice one,
and this guy came sprinting,

3454
02:31:14,361 --> 02:31:14,500
review.

3455
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:15,530
Do anymore leather goods.
I'm like,

3456
02:31:15,531 --> 02:31:16,130
I'm not at.
No,

3457
02:31:16,130 --> 02:31:18,140
I just had one leather jacket and I'm
like,

3458
02:31:18,530 --> 02:31:19,570
I'm out.
Like at.

3459
02:31:19,590 --> 02:31:22,680
So my,
my whole thing is I set it all up and I

3460
02:31:22,681 --> 02:31:25,560
don't bring plant because you can smell
that a mile away.

3461
02:31:25,590 --> 02:31:28,020
So I bring these little brought does
vape pen

3462
02:31:29,820 --> 02:31:32,070
and I'm hitting the fucking thing and
I'm hitting the thing and I'm all set

3463
02:31:32,071 --> 02:31:34,020
up.
Now I got to a $10 table,

3464
02:31:34,021 --> 02:31:38,130
$5 blanket and shit and whatever's
doesn't sell by about 1130 noon.

3465
02:31:38,131 --> 02:31:40,920
I start now to $2 blanket.
Now it's a dollar blanket.

3466
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:45,960
Everything's and I'm so.
And then they come running over and

3467
02:31:47,191 --> 02:31:48,240
they'll buy books.
I'm like,

3468
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:50,160
can I get four of these for a dollar?
I'm like,

3469
02:31:50,161 --> 02:31:53,700
Yup.
So I'm hitting this vape pen and I start

3470
02:31:53,701 --> 02:31:58,530
to feel this weird sensation in my chest
and it spreads to my arms and it's

3471
02:31:58,531 --> 02:32:01,320
almost like,
like I'm almost powerless.

3472
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:03,450
I can't,
I can't raise my arms.

3473
02:32:03,990 --> 02:32:06,150
And I see the circle start to close and
I'm like,

3474
02:32:06,180 --> 02:32:07,860
oh no,
I'm by myself.

3475
02:32:07,861 --> 02:32:08,970
I'm like,
there's no fucking away.

3476
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:10,680
Breathe through this shit.
And I'm just like,

3477
02:32:11,820 --> 02:32:12,960
don't pass out,
don't pen,

3478
02:32:12,961 --> 02:32:16,430
I've never passed out.
But that circle was fucking clothes and,

3479
02:32:16,690 --> 02:32:21,690
and I caught myself and I was able to
keep with it and I was texting,

3480
02:32:22,340 --> 02:32:23,210
you know,
my daughter's model,

3481
02:32:23,211 --> 02:32:24,490
I got some shit,
you know,

3482
02:32:24,530 --> 02:32:27,060
it's fucking 6:00 AM.
She's dead asleep.

3483
02:32:27,061 --> 02:32:29,100
Like if I,
if you don't hear from me in 30 minutes,

3484
02:32:29,101 --> 02:32:30,660
you know,
I'm texting weird shit.

3485
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:35,190
So I sell,
I get back to myself and I start selling

3486
02:32:35,191 --> 02:32:37,860
shit.
And by the end of that day I fucking

3487
02:32:37,861 --> 02:32:39,480
sold the table.
I brought the,

3488
02:32:39,481 --> 02:32:42,390
bring this shit on.
I went home with nothing and I get home

3489
02:32:42,391 --> 02:32:43,320
and she's like,
how'd you do?

3490
02:32:43,321 --> 02:32:45,150
And I go,
not as good as I thought I would because

3491
02:32:45,151 --> 02:32:46,380
I thought I'd make 3:50.

3492
02:32:46,770 --> 02:32:50,040
So they start telling me that everybody
in the apartment complex have bets

3493
02:32:50,041 --> 02:32:52,470
against me of what I would make.
And I was like,

3494
02:32:52,471 --> 02:32:54,090
what was the top one,
hundred and 50.

3495
02:32:54,091 --> 02:32:56,340
I fucking threw $650 on that table.
I was like,

3496
02:32:56,341 --> 02:33:00,540
that's a good motherfucking day out at
the Fort Rosebowl ps almost died.

3497
02:33:02,010 --> 02:33:05,190
So I tell my friend about that,
who he grows marijuana.

3498
02:33:05,191 --> 02:33:08,250
He smokes from the time he gets up to
the time he goes to bed and I was like,

3499
02:33:08,251 --> 02:33:10,320
I'm hitting one of these pens this
weekend at the thing.

3500
02:33:10,670 --> 02:33:12,030
He goes,
let me tell you how that ends.

3501
02:33:12,090 --> 02:33:12,781
I go,
what do you mean?

3502
02:33:12,781 --> 02:33:14,790
He goes,
I hit one this weekend at a wedding.

3503
02:33:14,850 --> 02:33:17,340
Same fucking thing.
He went into a seizure.

3504
02:33:19,070 --> 02:33:21,390
They took him to a hospital from the
wet.

3505
02:33:22,170 --> 02:33:25,290
These people see seizures and I'm like,
what?

3506
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:28,620
He said for a good 15 minutes when they
were like,

3507
02:33:28,621 --> 02:33:29,490
you're at the hospital.

3508
02:33:29,490 --> 02:33:31,590
He didn't know what a hospital was.
He was like,

3509
02:33:32,190 --> 02:33:35,920
he said it took him a minute to come
back to himself and I was.

3510
02:33:36,060 --> 02:33:38,040
So I just recently tried a new one
again.

3511
02:33:38,041 --> 02:33:39,720
I was like,
let me just try it like an idiot,

3512
02:33:39,870 --> 02:33:44,100
but for like a good two weeks I had that
feeling of like I didn't have my

3513
02:33:44,101 --> 02:33:45,300
strength.
You know what I mean?

3514
02:33:45,301 --> 02:33:46,740
Like I couldn't do it.
Yeah.

3515
02:33:46,741 --> 02:33:49,680
It was so weird.
All Cross this vape pen,

3516
02:33:49,870 --> 02:33:52,080
what is in the vapor?
What isn't that stuff?

3517
02:33:52,410 --> 02:33:54,390
Because there's a bunch of oils and
stuff like that.

3518
02:33:54,391 --> 02:33:57,450
They used to a wax it like,
that's what they all tell you.

3519
02:33:57,451 --> 02:34:00,300
We can't tell you.
I did talk last podcast a while ago and

3520
02:34:00,301 --> 02:34:00,751
I was like,
dude,

3521
02:34:00,751 --> 02:34:02,970
you've had a heart attack.
You shouldn't be smoking those pens.

3522
02:34:02,971 --> 02:34:06,140
And as I'm telling him that story is
producers got this look in his eye.

3523
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:07,740
Go.
I can tell he's like,

3524
02:34:07,750 --> 02:34:10,830
do when have a heart attack.
So a little while ago,

3525
02:34:10,831 --> 02:34:13,060
a few years back,
young,

3526
02:34:13,650 --> 02:34:16,500
and um,
his producers like step by step,

3527
02:34:16,501 --> 02:34:18,010
what you're saying me happened to me.
And

3528
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:21,310
Todd glass it over his shoulder.
I was like,

3529
02:34:21,311 --> 02:34:22,480
dude,
get rid of that thing.

3530
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:24,580
Just regular weeds.
Good.

3531
02:34:24,610 --> 02:34:25,380
That's it.
Playing.

3532
02:34:25,380 --> 02:34:26,760
Stop playing around.
There's no,

3533
02:34:26,890 --> 02:34:28,210
you don't need anything else.
Yeah.

3534
02:34:28,211 --> 02:34:29,980
The people were always giving me stuff
and I was like,

3535
02:34:29,981 --> 02:34:32,320
look,
I just like joints and sometimes I like

3536
02:34:32,321 --> 02:34:33,490
balance.
I like balance.

3537
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:36,640
This is the latest thing with tobacco on
the outside.

3538
02:34:36,680 --> 02:34:37,090
Yeah.
See,

3539
02:34:37,090 --> 02:34:39,020
I don't like that.
I like it.

3540
02:34:39,100 --> 02:34:43,670
The thing I never liked about the blunt
was I really liked the taste of weed and

3541
02:34:43,671 --> 02:34:48,070
I that old philly's like that wrapper
that it dominates the flavor.

3542
02:34:48,470 --> 02:34:50,310
It's like Cilantro,
you know what I mean?

3543
02:34:50,311 --> 02:34:51,990
Don't change anything but that.
Yeah.

3544
02:34:52,060 --> 02:34:56,980
Yeah.
He's got the shit that stuff is this

3545
02:34:56,981 --> 02:34:58,120
stuff.
It's got.

3546
02:34:58,450 --> 02:35:03,450
It's got some sort of a nice tobacco
leaf outside,

3547
02:35:03,641 --> 02:35:05,290
but powerful.
We'd inside.

3548
02:35:05,590 --> 02:35:07,390
You just got to be careful at how many
hits you take.

3549
02:35:07,420 --> 02:35:08,260
Yeah,
I bet.

3550
02:35:08,290 --> 02:35:09,730
Yeah,
that fucking looks like it gives you

3551
02:35:09,731 --> 02:35:13,960
like a little elevated thing too.
Like I had Charlie Murphy was always

3552
02:35:13,961 --> 02:35:16,950
into them and that's how I first got
introduced to blunts,

3553
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:20,140
was hanging out with Charlie.
We did a tour together and when we would

3554
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:22,200
get high together,
Charlie was always rolling blunts.

3555
02:35:22,250 --> 02:35:22,811
I was like,
all right,

3556
02:35:22,811 --> 02:35:24,010
I'll try it.
I'll try it.

3557
02:35:24,011 --> 02:35:24,491
I was like,
wow,

3558
02:35:24,491 --> 02:35:25,600
this is interesting.
I'm like,

3559
02:35:25,601 --> 02:35:26,770
it's different.
It's like it's different,

3560
02:35:26,771 --> 02:35:28,750
right?
It's different.

3561
02:35:28,751 --> 02:35:30,700
It's like it's weird,
but it's also something else.

3562
02:35:30,760 --> 02:35:33,220
You know?
It's got a little extra kick,

3563
02:35:34,090 --> 02:35:35,470
but yeah,
this,

3564
02:35:35,530 --> 02:35:40,120
this pen thing and just people always
trying to find new ways to get fucked

3565
02:35:40,121 --> 02:35:42,190
up.
Like there's enough ways they're already

3566
02:35:42,191 --> 02:35:43,200
established.
Yup.

3567
02:35:43,450 --> 02:35:44,220
It's the,
the,

3568
02:35:44,220 --> 02:35:46,920
the jaw joints are the best.
I mean those dot.

3569
02:35:46,930 --> 02:35:50,290
I was telling you about those doctors
when we were talking before the show and

3570
02:35:50,590 --> 02:35:55,120
the thing he said about smoking a bowl
is just the only thing you have to worry

3571
02:35:55,121 --> 02:35:55,390
about.

3572
02:35:55,390 --> 02:35:57,190
The butane you're sucking in from the
lighter.

3573
02:35:57,430 --> 02:36:01,030
It's not the smoking in glass.
Don't put it in like taste it.

3574
02:36:01,150 --> 02:36:01,721
Yeah,
you can.

3575
02:36:01,721 --> 02:36:03,450
Absolutely.
I just saw a lighter the other day at a

3576
02:36:03,451 --> 02:36:06,580
shop that was a alcohol.
I've never seen that before and I don't

3577
02:36:06,581 --> 02:36:08,560
know if that's it.
I don't know if that's any better for

3578
02:36:08,561 --> 02:36:10,540
you or not,
but it was an alcohol lighter instead of

3579
02:36:10,541 --> 02:36:12,520
a butane lighter.
I imagine it would be better,

3580
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:15,760
but I've used matches before for that
very reason because I could smell.

3581
02:36:16,390 --> 02:36:19,030
That's what cigars like.
You're not supposed to light a cigar

3582
02:36:19,031 --> 02:36:22,200
with a butane lighter.
They stink and you're supposed to light

3583
02:36:22,201 --> 02:36:23,950
it.
They love the real cigar dorks,

3584
02:36:24,250 --> 02:36:26,980
they'll take a cigar or or lighter
rather,

3585
02:36:26,981 --> 02:36:31,981
and they'll light a piece of cedar and
then the use that piece of Cedar to

3586
02:36:32,111 --> 02:36:34,870
light the cigar.
So there's no bullshit,

3587
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:36,700
no bullshit fumes.

3588
02:36:37,450 --> 02:36:40,690
They'll take a match light the Cedar and
then take that Cedar Light.

3589
02:36:40,691 --> 02:36:43,210
The cigar.
Yeah.

3590
02:36:43,270 --> 02:36:45,250
Not to blend fan though,
but I get it.

3591
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:46,780
I've smoked enough of them,
but I'm like,

3592
02:36:46,900 --> 02:36:47,940
I really liked the test.
Why?

3593
02:36:47,960 --> 02:36:50,190
Like joints?
Because you can taste the weed guy.

3594
02:36:50,191 --> 02:36:53,080
I enjoy the taste of marijuana.
I do too.

3595
02:36:53,170 --> 02:36:56,440
Especially the California weed stuff
we're getting today.

3596
02:36:56,441 --> 02:36:57,274
It's like,
Ooh.

3597
02:36:57,610 --> 02:36:59,440
It's nice.
It's nice.

3598
02:36:59,530 --> 02:37:02,130
We live in a good time.
We do live in a good spot.

3599
02:37:03,320 --> 02:37:04,900
I gotta wrap this up.
It's 3:00.

3600
02:37:05,170 --> 02:37:06,070
