Constantly distracted.

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,421
Well,

47
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:05,000

59
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:36,114
They're beautiful.

62
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:43,851
Well Listen,

66
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,780
The first time I went

67
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,810
can I get somebody to free?

68
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,030
Had nothing that was old cold cuts
and the bottom that had been open?

69
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,170
Nothing.

70
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:00,840
Well,

71
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,090
when you live by yourself,

72
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:06,410
what the fuck was this is when
you didn't even think of a woman.

73
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:06,831
Nothing.

74
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:09,820

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,070
you know?

80
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,910
And it was fucking just a
blend of protein powder.

81
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,301

00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:37,990

Man.

111
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,320
The way he would look at Pussy,

112
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:02,711
it was like,

113
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:05,410
he was looking at a beautiful flower,

114
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,440
like a girl had a beautiful flower that
she was showing them and very child like

115
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,590
as if a young girl had a beautiful flower.

116
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,030
Like it wasn't even dirty.

117
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,430
He,

118
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,051
the girl was like,

119
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:17,170
she had her asshole and his face and
he had his big smile on his face.

120
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:18,730
He was high as fuck.

121
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,811
And I'll never forget that.

122
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:20,320
He's like,

123
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,580
that's beautiful.

124
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,650
Whose Dad is beautiful?

125
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,810
And it was just so earnest and so like
appreciative and I swear it wasn't even

126
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:31,330
remotely creepy.

127
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:32,410
It was nice.

128
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,770
He was looking at this dirty stripper
and he was so high and so in tune.

129
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,510
Then he was just being
really nice to her about it.

130
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,680
Who's really happy,

131
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:42,790

132
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,690
That's beautiful.

133
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,610
Like he wasn't creepy at all.

134
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,511
He was like,

135
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:50,740
if you were a woman in a strip club and
you met him in that situation you would,

136
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:51,574
you would have a good,

137
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,710
that was an enjoyable
conversation for her.

138
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,540
There wasn't anything
creepy or dirty about it.

139
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,340
You would want to go out and buy some
battle ropes after watching this and

140
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,160
getting,

141

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,583
This is part of the show.

150
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,433

to have it on Sirius [inaudible].

152
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,270
Most of it's on Sirius.

153
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,260
This part ain't,

154

I was listening to because I,

158
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,200

162
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,980
I don't want to say

163
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:36,310

164
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,720

00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,073
Say it.

173
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,033
No Way,

174
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,443
no way.

175
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,300
So Okay Duncan even,

176
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,270
but all the things that we produce are
so much more entertaining then fucking I

177
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,860
just taught us to us.

178
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,873
I don't know man.

179
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,320
I can't very specific.

180
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,120
It's really interesting to me what's
going on with some of these radio shows is

181
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:20,170
because it's just the same shit
every fucking day and they're just,

182
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,330
it's like a soap opera
of people screaming.

183
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,290
Let's get through this commercial.

184
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,030
Kind of a good thing to talk
about because it's been very,

185
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,670
and know exactly what you're saying,

186
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,840
whatever.

187
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,240
Go to on.com and check out some shit.

188
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,931
What is a,

189
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:32,950
what are Alpha brain?

190
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:35,380
What does Alpha brands in
nootropic and when nootropics,

191
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,520
ours is a very controversial
field of vitamins and nutrients,

192
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:41,560
being able to enhance brain function.

193
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,480
There is some evidence,

194
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:48,481
there's a a very detailed website on
on a.com where it goes over all of the

195
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:53,230
different scientific aspects
of each individual ingredient.

196
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,240
It's like I said,

197
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:55,660
it is,

198
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,920
it is a controversial thing.

199
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,130
It's gets a lot of people up

200
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,551
in arms,

201
00:05:58,551 --> 00:05:58,980
but I,

202
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,710
I firmly believe in nutrition and I
firmly believe in supplementing nutrition

203
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:07,310
and I know it's aided me and I know
Alpha brain most certainly aids me.

204
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:07,491
I,

205
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:07,870
I,

206
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,530
I absolutely enjoy the effects.

207
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,160
It's not a placebo by any stretch of
the imagination and to make sure that

208
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:15,950
people don't think it is the
way we have it set up as if you,

209
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,330
you order 30 pills,

210
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,100
you get a hundred percent
money back guarantee,

211
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:20,990
you don't even have to return the product.

212
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:21,381
You just say,

213
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:21,980
it sucked.

214
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,970
Give me my money back,

215
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,840
it's over.

216
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,110
And we just don't want
anybody to feel ripped off.

217
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:28,310
So that's how we have it set up.

218
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,090
Um,

219
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,920
we also have,

220
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,110
uh,

221
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,943
Justin,

222
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:31,400
uh,

223
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,310
battle ropes and kettlebells.

224
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,730
We're starting to sell fitness equipment.

225
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:35,990
All the shit that I use,

226
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:38,720
all the shit that is like really,

227
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,030
uh,

228
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,410
the kind of stuff that you see like MMA
fighters use is trying to conditioning

229
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:44,300
videos w body weight,

230
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:49,330
like full body exercise movements
like clean and press and,

231
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,160
and Hindu squats and chin ups and things
where you move your body around plus

232
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:55,880
weight,

233
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,181
you know,

234
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,800
you these Turkish getups.

235
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,200
These things are amazing
for your core strength.

236
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,090
It's just wood.

237
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,320
Kettlebells are is basically,

238
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,500
it's like a cannon ball with a handle on
it and one of the coolest exercises as

239
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:10,580
you just lying down on your back and
standing up with that thing and then

240
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,940
bringing your brown down to your back
and then standing up with it again.

241
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,860
It is fucking hard.

242
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,790
Try doing that shit with a 70
pound kettle bells fuck man.

243
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,310
To balance that bitch out,

244
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:26,330
straighten your arm out and you engage
muscles in a way that you almost never do

245
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,460
by traditional weightlifting.

246
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,680
It's really a weird type of working
out and I enjoy it and it's my favorite

247
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:38,120
strength and conditioning exercises
as far as like applicable strength for

248
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:39,760
Jujitsu and um,

249
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,670
for uh,

250
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,040
I think for anything athletic,

251
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,700
anything we'd have to move things around.

252
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:48,170
When you have a body that's used to
moving it around itself around plus weight

253
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,790
in really awkward ways,

254
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:53,510
you develop a very strong body and
there's a lot of videos online.

255
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,040
We have summit on at.com we're
going to produce some videos and uh,

256
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,800
take you guys through a really good
strength and conditioning work on.

257
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,200
I think that would be a
great thing for us to do too.

258
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:06,770
Just so you can get a sense of like
what kind of benefits you can get from,

259
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:10,190
especially if you see some of these
like really fit dudes that are,

260
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:10,461
you know,

261
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:13,730
like these like Steve Maxwell type dudes
that have been doing it their whole

262
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:14,481
lives that are in there.

263
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:14,690
Yeah.

264
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,180
Maxwell,

265
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,180
I think it's like close to 60 and he
looks fucking phenomenal and he's a big

266
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,380
advocate of a,

267
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:23,780
of kettle bells and
battle ropes with these.

268
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,070
Ours might have seen him.

269
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:29,120
Brock Lesnar use them and one of the
countdown shows that these giant ropes and

270
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,500
electric you would like tie a ship down
with like 40 feet long and they have

271
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:34,334
these uh,

272
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,390
kept ends and you grab a hold of him
and you whip these motherfuckers through

273
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:43,391
the air and you can do these different
sequences of movements like in sprint you

274
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:47,300
doing for like sprints of 30 seconds and
then you relax for 20 seconds and then

275
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:51,110
sprint for 30 seconds and
holy fuck is it brutal?

276
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,320
I mean it is some old
school caveman type shit,

277
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,280
throwing ropes around man.

278
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,930
And when you throw ropes around,

279
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,321
it's a,

280
00:08:58,321 --> 00:08:58,711
it's a,

281
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,420
it's a real wild thing,

282
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:00,661
man.

283
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:01,590
It's like all your,

284
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,930
everything's working kind of together,

285
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,591
but it's,

286
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,050
it's all like one big unit.

287
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:07,651
You know,

288
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:07,921
your,

289
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:11,610
your whole body whipping these ropes
and on balanced in shit and you're

290
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:15,510
correcting for him all the time and
moving him and whipping them left and

291
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:16,470
whipping them riding.

292
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,970
It's fucking wild,

293
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:18,241
man.

294
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,980
It's a burns you out quick.

295
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,401
Like,

296
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:22,350
you would think I could probably
do that for half an hour.

297
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:23,400
The fuck you can.

298
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,310
They'll fuck you can 30
seconds into doing that shit.

299
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:27,144
You want to die.

300
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,193
It's amazing.

301
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,430
It's a great workout.

302
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,301
Um,

303
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:30,631
so,

304
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:30,840
uh,

305
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,920
go check all that shit out.

306
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:32,840
Use a code name Brogan,

307
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:35,940
and you get 10% off of
any of the supplements.

308
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,170
And I'm including hemp force
was just gets released today.

309
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,490
The most fucking delicious hemp protein
you've ever tasted in your life.

310
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,710
There's the top level shit.

311
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,510
It's all natural and it's
even naturally sweetened.

312
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:50,730
It's sweetened with Stevia,

313
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,730
raw cocoa and super nutritious.

314
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:56,240
This stuff is phenomenal for you and uh,

315
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,540
it's fucking expensive.

316
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,500
I'm going to be honest with you.

317
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,280
Um,

318
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,661
it's,

319
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:00,900
it's expensive to make.

320
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,610
It's expensive to get the good,

321
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,750
but it's the shit.

322
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:04,411
Well,

323
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:05,310
it's because the hemp,

324
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:09,990
the hemp farms is only like three farms
in Canada then it's be because our

325
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:14,370
country is fucking retarded
when it comes to certain plants.

326
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,660
Hamp is illegal.

327
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,360
Even though hemp is not psychoactive,

328
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,680
you can't get high from it.

329
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,900
Hemp is illegal.

330
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:20,991
Well,

331
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:23,670
hemp is a tremendous source of protein.

332
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,690
And even though we're allowed to
buy him products in this country,

333
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:28,830
like hemp protein,

334
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:30,600
which we import from Canada,

335
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,220
even though you're allowed to buy it,

336
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:33,510
you can't grow it here.

337
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,721
So it's,

338
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,090
it's really stupid.

339
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,880
It's the farms have limited production.

340
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,430
They can't keep up with the demand.

341
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,050
We and we can't do anything about it.

342
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:43,301
It's not,

343
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:46,800
it would just pay some American farmers
to start growing hemp here and put

344
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:47,430
people,

345
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,780
put American workers,

346
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,340
you know,

347
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,590
uh,

348
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,250
to work.

349
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,930
And that's like a Mitt Romney type thing.

350
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,460
You know,

351
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,390
we need hemp farms.

352
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:54,770
You,

353
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,070
you're fucking twats.

354
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,020
Anyway,

355
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,130
go get some help for us.

356
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:00,150
It's fucking delicious.

357
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:05,100
It is a really the best tasting
hemp protein shit I've ever had.

358
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,400
It's a hamp with this
Stevia to it and it's,

359
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,600
it's really delicious.

360
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,870
You the code name Rogan and you can
save 10% off and it's not as bad,

361
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:13,710
but it ain't cheap.

362
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,440
But that's life pitches.

363
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,381
It's expensive.

364
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:17,580
Shit is expensive.

365
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,310
Joey Diaz is here and heightened a fuck.

366
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,870
Strap it down.

367
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,023
Joey's here.

368
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,990
Let's get the party started.

369
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,620
Experience Joe Rogan podcast by night.

370
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,230
He bull behave.

371
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,490
People behave mad flavors.

372
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:42,120
Here.

373
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,130
What baby growing up my brother,

374
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:45,640
I can't call it getting ready for that,

375
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,513
but it's weekend.

376
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,150
Damn my mother fucking idiot.

377
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:48,720
You're in a,

378
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,171
yeah.

379
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:50,180
If you're in Cincinnati,

380
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,470
go check out my man Duncan Trussell
Dunkin trust is going to be a go in

381
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,010
Cincinnati

382
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,843
all weekend.

383
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,940
Have you never done go bananas?

384
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:59,200
I places great places.

385
00:11:59,201 --> 00:11:59,540
It's pretty.

386
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,011
That's great.

387
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,930
I did have a place back
in the nineties man.

388
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:02,621
I only did it once,

389
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,321
but I enjoyed it.

390
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:05,200
It's a real old school comedy club.

391
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:06,851
I pleased it.

392
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,300
Shit.

393
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,280
Denver paramount theater this weekend.

394
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:10,114

395
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,330
mother fucking 50 this this Friday.

396
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:16,180
The best show is going to be Joey Diaz,

397
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,280
Joe Rogan and Brendan Walsh.

398
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,310
That's what we just said.

399
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,130
That's what we just said.

400
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,060
[inaudible] no,

401
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,810
I was just [inaudible] reinstate.

402
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,370
Reinforcing though.

403
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,570
You're you.

404
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:27,460
Are you talking shit about Dunkin again?

405
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,030
God dammit.

406
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,863
Let it go son.

407
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,930
What you doing by saying
that's the best show to go see,

408
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:33,220
not to go see the one in Cincinnati.

409
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:33,401
No,

410
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:36,250
it was just reinforcing that
your guys a show in my opinion,

411
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,140
is the best show in the fucking road.

412
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,950
I love all three of those comics
and putting them together.

413
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,670
I love Britain walls.

414
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,810
I think he's hilarious.

415
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,441
He is like,

416
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:48,640
we just did the bone zone last night
and that is a fun thing for me to do.

417
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,860
Like it's fun doing the bone zone.

418
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,510
That's how awesome.

419
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:54,250
I think last night with you guys.

420
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:54,790
Oh it's,

421
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,540
we just do it.

422
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,160
We don't ever have guessed really?

423
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:58,390
Which she wouldn't have
been somebody else.

424
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,130
Randy Lik can Davey Johnson.

425
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,340
Yeah.

426
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,330
They're very funny guys.

427
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:02,310
They're very smart guys.

428
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:04,300
So of of a cool sense of humor.

429
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,970
You know Brendan is a
very funny standup too.

430
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,720
Very funny.

431
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,531
I'm looking forward to this.

432
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:09,880
We're going to have a
good fucking time block.

433
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:10,061
Yeah.

434
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:10,900
I can't wait to eat.

435
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,851
I love that stuff.

436
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:13,684
I love guns.

437
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,530
All that stuff.

438
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,230
Does it feel weird to you go in
there right after the tragedy.

439
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,420
I haven't gone to see the movie yet
because I don't want to sit down.

440
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,380
I want to sit there and go,

441
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:25,450
this is what these pull
last people seen as what?

442
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:26,284
They got scared.

443
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,293
I didn't even think of that,

444
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,211
that angle of it.

445
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:30,520
I never thought about it like that,

446
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:31,440
but I just,

447
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,670
the tragedy,

448
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,431
it was a bad thing.

449
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:34,740
It was four weeks.

450
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:39,741
So can you imagine something like that
hitting close to home when you start

451
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,640
seeing people that are trying
to do a copycat crimes now,

452
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,100
didn't you say that someone
got arrested in Ohio,

453
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:48,791
in Ohio,

454
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,200
somebody came up with like a knife,

455
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,800
a gun,

456
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,633
ammo,

457
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,653
everything.

458
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,640
You know,

459
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,473
you know,

460
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,310
this is where the real cynical people,

461
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,540
the really cynical,

462
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,040
crazy conspiracy people,

463
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,240
these are the ones,

464
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,580
this is where they start thinking that
the government is doing this and that

465
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,660
they're doing this on purpose because
they want to disarm Americans because they

466
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:10,180
know that everything's going to fall
apart and they don't want people to have

467
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:11,014
guns.

468
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,741
I mean,

469
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:14,170
that's sounds completely ridiculous,

470
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,670
but if you were going to write a
movie about how some super corrupt

471
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,890
multinational corporations figure
out a way to control the whole world,

472
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,390
it would probably write it like that.

473
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:25,961
You'd probably,

474
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:28,240
you'd probably have everything
wired and hooked up like that.

475
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:28,410
Right?

476
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,270
If you throw the Jab,

477
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,160
Alex Jones,

478
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,250
I am his witness and Houston at the UFC.

479
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,080
He told me to my face,

480
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:35,950
I did two years,

481
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:41,050
there was only be TSA security at Parks
and movie theaters and I was right there

482
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:41,884
when he told me that.

483
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,940
He told me that to my face was sitting
outside of the UFC and we're just talking

484
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:46,751
about different things.

485
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:47,584
So

486
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,271
what is it?

487
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:50,290
Is it because,

488
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,160
is it just a natural thing

489
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,030
that you know,

490
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:56,200
because there's a lot of crime
because there's a lot of disparate.

491
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:57,410
The economy's in the toilet,

492
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:57,860
it's just,

493
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,640
it's a natural thing that things pop
off and crazy people do shit like this.

494
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:06,650
Or do you want to follow the conspiracy
theory point where they think that

495
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:10,400
they're doing this on purpose because
they've engineered the collapse of the

496
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:11,090
dollar.

497
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,270
They know that the world economy is going
to implode and they don't want people

498
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:15,104
to be armed.

499
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,240
They want to be able to maintain power.

500
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,620
I wasn't looking at it like that.

501
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:19,760
I'm a very cynical person.

502
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,440
I was looking at it as a business angle.

503
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,873
You know what,

504
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,460
fucking shoot somebody
to move movie theater.

505
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,800
They got to put security of 2 million
thousand movie theaters across the

506
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,634
country.

507
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,660
The next is parks,

508
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:30,050
whatever.

509
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,670
But that I come to my senses,

510
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:35,330
I wake up and I put the joint down and
then I go to bad things happen every

511
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:36,120
fucking day.

512
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,560
But you know,

513
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,221
that's here.

514
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:38,054
They happen,

515
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,470
they happen somewhere.

516
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,610
That is though,

517
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:44,120
if you were a government and you are
evil and you were trying to control the

518
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:44,630
people,

519
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,590
that is what you do.

520
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:45,881
You,

521
00:15:45,881 --> 00:15:47,450
you organize attacks.

522
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,930
And it's been pointed out before that
the American public has tried to do this

523
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,310
or the mare,

524
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,731
excuse me,

525
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:53,480
the American,

526
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,860
the government has tried to do this.

527
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,870
They at one point in time to the,

528
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:57,380
um,

529
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,180
operation Northwoods was written,

530
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:00,700
where was an idea that they were gonna do,

531
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,550
were gonna fake attacks on
American civilians to get
us to go to war with Cuba.

532
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,230
They're going to blow up a jet liner and
say there was people in it there we're

533
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:10,740
going to arm Cuban friendlies
to tack wan taught them,

534
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:10,971
obey.

535
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:11,530
It was going to be,

536
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,410
but that's,

537
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,040
that's like a real thing that they were
going to do to try to get us into a war

538
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:16,874
with Cuba.

539
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,750
So when you find out about conspiracies
like crazy things like that where you're

540
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:20,931
like,

541
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:21,351
wow,

542
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:22,730
like they would fake shit.

543
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,060
Like they're allowed to think
like that when that came out.

544
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,970
That should have been
a huge piece of news.

545
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,830
That should have been
something where you know,

546
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:33,680
everyone demanded that
should be hearings on this.

547
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,870
It should be like brought
out in front of the public.

548
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,920
People should be in the streets
like screaming about this.

549
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,120
Like how is this possible?

550
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:42,500
How would they now prosecuted?

551
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,640
They were really going to risk American
lives and have Americans killed just to

552
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:47,600
further their agenda.

553
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:51,230
They were going to fake an act of war
in order to get us into war because they

554
00:16:51,231 --> 00:16:52,370
thought they knew better than us.

555
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:55,670
So it was this just one
dumb fuck that just like,

556
00:16:55,671 --> 00:16:56,720
hey this is my idea.

557
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:57,111
And they're like,

558
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:57,381
all right,

559
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:57,740
come on.

560
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,220
Stop.

561
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,220
What was signed by the Joint Chiefs of
Staff is the joints chiefs of stats on,

562
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,160
did they have a math problem at the
time and they got like new ones like the

563
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,440
next day.

564
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,070
I think they used to rocket
like that all the time.

565
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,720
That's why when you know you,

566
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:14,150
these conspiracy nuts
come out and they say,

567
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:14,361
hey,

568
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:19,150
we believe that this guy was brainwashed
and someone got ahold of him and they

569
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,220
did an experiment with him and
he's like a Manchurian candidate.

570
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,170
It sounds fucking completely ridiculous.

571
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,460
It sounds completely ridiculous.

572
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,900
But if,

573
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,350
uh,

574
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,480
if they were willing
to do that other stuff,

575
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,600
why wouldn't they be willing to do
that if they really could do that?

576
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,320
You imagine if they figured
out a way to reprogram people,

577
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,640
if it wasn't science fiction,

578
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,230
you don't think they would do it.

579
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,090
Of course they would do it.

580
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,080
If the government really did find some
super sophisticated way where they could

581
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:48,790
just say pumpkin to you
and you fucking snap and,

582
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,980
and why yourself up

583
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,760
with grenades and run into a room full
of important people and blow yourself up,

584
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,080
you don't think they would do that?

585
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,190
Of course they would.

586
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,750
That's a great way to do it.

587
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,050
You get some idiot is willing to do that
for you and have him walk in and pull

588
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:01,441
the trigger.

589
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:01,951
It's amazing.

590
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:05,280
I haven't really focused on the Colorado
thing as much cause he's just fucking

591
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:08,160
negative and anything
like that until my mind,

592
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,870
my mind is just tragic,

593
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:10,620
right?

594
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,060
I want to know what the fuck happened.

595
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,800
I want to know where
the system went wrong.

596
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,280
Now you've heard I'd been here
before and I told you about Colorado.

597
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:19,200
We both discuss Colorado,

598
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,520
but I've lived in New York,

599
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:21,231
California,

600
00:18:21,231 --> 00:18:24,150
and I hang out with gangsters
and the craziest motherfuckers.

601
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:25,540
I know when the amounts.

602
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,190
Yeah,

603
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,230
I'm okay now let's just leave that.

604
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,960
You know I've been reading bits
and pieces like he was going to a

605
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,520
psychotherapist or psychiatrist.

606
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,353
I don't know.

607
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,280
Now she alarmed somebody.

608
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,570
She warned somebody.

609
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,850
Just psycho therapists.

610
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,760
This is what I heard.

611
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:40,290
Is this true or is this not true?

612
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,520
Who did she want?

613
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,900
Who does she want him?

614
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:44,040
Why weren't these people?

615
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,150
Why was this fucking lunatic contact?

616
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,880
Then the other side of me says,

617
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,590
I understand we can't react to every
fucking call the police because a guy up

618
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:53,730
here waving a gun,

619
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,080
is he hurt anybody?

620
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:55,261
No,

621
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:59,580
we cannot respond to every call
because of the budgets and whatever.

622
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,650
So who dropped this?

623
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:06,420
This is a kid that bought thousands of
rounds of ammunition at a local fucking

624
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:06,721
place.

625
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:07,710
The guns all legit.

626
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:08,820
Like I told you in Colorado,

627
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,320
but you can buy a fucking bazooka.

628
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,361
What was your pay?

629
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:11,790
And he'll,

630
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,440
Brian does your dog and cat shit.

631
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,180
Get her out of there.

632
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:17,010
She's in my fucking cat's litter box.

633
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,260
Get her,

634
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,600
get her.

635
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,433
Get her.

636
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,490
Jesus Christ.

637
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,280
This is what fucks with me a lot.

638
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,971
Shut that door,

639
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:24,270
man.

640
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:24,721
This is what?

641
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:24,961
Fuck,

642
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:25,860
sorry folks.

643
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,791
Sorry folks.

644
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,571
This is a real shot.

645
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:28,200
This is how it works.

646
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,310
This is what fucks with me.

647
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:34,370
How the system fail that
this big got fucking helmets

648
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,920
we had at the fucking system fail.

649
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,200
It fails somewhere and
where did he get the money?

650
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,970
They said that the speculation was
that he used as a scholarship money.

651
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:44,491
Is that what it is?

652
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:44,731
Yeah.

653
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:47,730
I didn't know you could just use your
scholarship money for other shit and you

654
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:48,760
thought you had to pay for school.

655
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:49,400
He withdrew.

656
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,233
He withdrew.

657
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,510
Well when you get a scholarship,

658
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:53,040
but you're like
responsible for that money,

659
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,530
like say if you've got
$20,000 for a scholarship,

660
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,791
did you,

661
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,060
uh,

662
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,740
do you actually have to spend that
money on the college or could you like,

663
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,940
and like Gerber baby an insurance
that I got for myself when I was 17,

664
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:10,140
I bought a baby Gerber insurance now,

665
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:11,670
but I guess like the Gerber Insurance,

666
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:12,504
like uh,

667
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,670
I don't know what you did.

668
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,550
You just do apply for a college essay.

669
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,393
She'll get a grant.

670
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,181
You get a grant,

671
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,650
you got to find that financial aid.

672
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,430
You got to pay back.

673
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,480
They'll give it to you once.

674
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:24,600
You got one fucking long going to
give me what the fuck you want.

675
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,810
You'll keep giving it to you.

676
00:20:25,811 --> 00:20:27,700
A plus La,

677
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,490
I forget all the pell grant.

678
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:30,390
You don't have to pay back.

679
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:31,224
That's a grant,

680
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,210
but all those loans you got to pay back.

681
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,171
I'm gonna tell you something.

682
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:35,400
You sign up for college.

683
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,620
Let's say your parents
are not that well off.

684
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:38,700
You sign up for college,

685
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:41,910
they cover the tuition and you reach
out and you could get all these grants

686
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:42,744
available to you.

687
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,170
There's a lot of fucking money out there
available to you for what he was going

688
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:47,004
to school for.

689
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:47,920
You know?

690
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,610
Especially

691
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,350
for what he was going to school for it.

692
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,340
This kid was a genius wasn't it psycho
fucking something alleyway that I don't

693
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:55,310
know what the fuck it was called.

694
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,140
They give you the loop.

695
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,200
They continuously are you
going to spend on the back?

696
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,620
They give you the loop bro.

697
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,780
I was taking college money when I was
going to university of Colorado and buying

698
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:09,230
cars with the curbing him like seeing
like a Volkswagen for 800 and sell for 400

699
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:12,160
for 1200 that's what I was doing
with my financial aid money.

700
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,170
What you do is you sign up rating and
credits and you get money for 18 credits

701
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:21,310
but right before the school season starts
you cut it down to nine and you pocket

702
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:22,144
that gayness.

703
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,180
By the time they know what the fuck is
going on and they sent you a letter in

704
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:25,780
the mail.

705
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,740
The gators is gone.

706
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,791
It's of the happy.

707
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,770
I'll go deal with the
bartender and the coke dealer.

708
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,460
That might be the greatest word ever.

709
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:34,110
Gators gave us divis,

710
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,790
Dina's,

711
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,590
G.

712
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:36,590
E.

713
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:36,590
T.

714
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:36,590
U.

715
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:36,591
S.

716
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:37,640
Guida S.

717
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:37,941
See,

718
00:21:37,941 --> 00:21:39,130
I always thought it was gators,

719
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:39,781
Doug Gee,

720
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:40,161
this is,

721
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:40,941
if you live in Florida,

722
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:41,840
you hate alligators.

723
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,520
This is this cock sucking.

724
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,701
But you know,

725
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:48,590
I've heard people call a gator's though.

726
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,513
Not that's

727
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,900
Peter's is shit.

728
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,611
But that was,

729
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,360
uh,

730
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,040
my friend Johnny used that term.

731
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,050
Get us,

732
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,920
we talked when he's talking
about gambling money,

733
00:21:57,921 --> 00:21:59,060
my guess

734
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,210
kind of get that gayness.

735
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,520
I feel

736
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,910
bad for what happened in Colorado.

737
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:05,790
It was a fucked up said,

738
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,880
but I want to know where he got.

739
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,500
I want to know how he learned to
light the fucking smokescreen.

740
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:10,981
Well,

741
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:11,791
he was a genius.

742
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,200
He could have figured that online.

743
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:14,670
Do they teach you this shit online?

744
00:22:14,671 --> 00:22:16,540
I'm scared to even fucking look at by a,

745
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,030
you could figure out the plans
to build a nuclear bomb online.

746
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,841
Like you literally,

747
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:21,360
yeah,

748
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:21,880
sure.

749
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,030
I'm,

750
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,890
I'm pretty positive.

751
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:23,820
Yeah,

752
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,091
I bet.

753
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:24,930
If you were smart enough,

754
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,990
you're smart enough and you had
access to him for what's in there.

755
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,490
A kid who was trying to build
a nuclear bomb in his backyard,

756
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,010
there's a million right now
that are trying to do that.

757
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,311
But no,

758
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:33,900
there was a kid who got arrested.

759
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,560
Yeah,

760
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,210
but he's building a nuclear bomb in his
backyard is it sounds like horse shit.

761
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,770
I kind of hold on a nuclear bomb.

762
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,191
Oh,

763
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:41,560
I see.

764
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,320
So you can learn all this shit online.

765
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:44,390
I don't know why some of these,

766
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,360
I mean that thing he did at home,

767
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,560
what he wired his house with bombs
and fucking liquids and all that Shit.

768
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:51,450
He learned that outline.

769
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,140
What you guys are fucking
trying to tell me.

770
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,150
Yeah.

771
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:54,481
Yeah.

772
00:22:54,481 --> 00:22:59,481
This kid and this kid was
a some dangerous nut man.

773
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:02,490
He tried to build a nuclear
bomb and his mom's shed.

774
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,090
There was a kid who really did it.

775
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,670
Was He tried,

776
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,430
he did he think he was trying like it.

777
00:23:08,431 --> 00:23:11,900
Was he using like real materials or
was he using like cheers they see,

778
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,421
no,

779
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:13,980
he was using real materials.

780
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:14,910
That's how they got them.

781
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:20,570
Apparently they ha they keep a very
close eye on all of the Pie Tonio of the

782
00:23:20,581 --> 00:23:21,414
world.

783
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,021
You know,

784
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:26,250
it's very hard to get Tony
and we know whatever it is,

785
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,560
whether it's plutonium or
whatever it is they use to,

786
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,490
they need to make some
sort of a nuclear weapon.

787
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,270
We know what that stuff is supposedly
and then we keep an eye on it.

788
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,920
But to be Jesus Christ,

789
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,540
Marty McFly can get it.

790
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,433
Anyone can get it.

791
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,110
If this fucking kid can
make this shit in his yard,

792
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,651
you know,

793
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:43,921
I mean,

794
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:45,090
what is he that much smarter?

795
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,033
Everybody else

796
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,430
does shit that fuck my world up was one
of the night I was watching discovery

797
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:53,390
and they showed you how to
make speed on fucking this guy.

798
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,440
They had these kids,

799
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:57,570
they showed you how to make
steroids speed and something else.

800
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,640
It's steroids guys live right here in
Sherman oaks or something that had like a,

801
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:01,911
you know,

802
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:06,110
like outlaw things on their faces and
they show how they cook them on the stove

803
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:06,721
and stuff.

804
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:07,530
And this,

805
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,940
this is a crazy asshole.

806
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,850
They pulled him over and
this is the guy's name.

807
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:11,900
His name is David Hahn.

808
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:13,010
He was 17 years old.

809
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:13,560
Uh,

810
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:13,760
the,

811
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,390
the police pulled him over and they found
radioactive materials and the trunk of

812
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:18,224
his car,

813
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:22,070
his mother's property was cleared up on
the environmental protection agency 10

814
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:25,010
months later as a super fund cleanup site.

815
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,410
This mother fucker like really did,

816
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,423
I mean he was like,

817
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,470
he came really close.

818
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,903
Wow.

819
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,930
Okay.

820
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,730
He made his own nuclear reactor.

821
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,960
Holy Shit.

822
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,230
He attained his eagle scout rank
in the boy scouts shortly after.

823
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,000
It was what's his name was dismantled.

824
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:48,570
They,

825
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,630
the boy scouts still let
them have an eagle scout.

826
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,000
I let them run the fucking party.

827
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,000
He's not getting fucking the scout troop.

828
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,750
Benevolent leader.

829
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,670
His name was David Hawn.

830
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:01,580
It says while his reactor
never reached critical mass,

831
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,240
Han attracted the attention of local
police are found radioactive materials.

832
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:05,600
Huh?

833
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,780
Be careful what that chocolate bar just
so I guess he came really close to just

834
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:09,740
eat that whole chocolate bar.

835
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,520
I just want to let you know
there's a gentleman that's,

836
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,720
I'm just a regular chocolate bark.

837
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,340
Joey Diaz just participated in.

838
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,070
I know that's the one that you said
it was the highest you've ever done a

839
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:22,520
podcast and what's at
whammy bar from La speedway?

840
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,070
It didn't,

841
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,903
there's just no,

842
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,580
I didn't need to be talking.

843
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,650
There's no need for me to be talking about

844
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,153
when you're that baked.

845
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:30,741
Oh please.

846
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:32,500
I just not the debt.

847
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,450
We want you to talk to watch it.

848
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,030
We don't want you to go into

849
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:40,883
essentials.

850
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,180
We don't want you to go into the
chocolate whole great fighters tickets.

851
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,770
Right.

852
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,170
That's losing fights in a long,

853
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,810
long time and I think I
was thinking about it.

854
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:55,370
I think they should do just as many la
fights as they do Vegas because it's

855
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:56,480
really the same shit.

856
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:58,250
The same people kind of Miss Golf,

857
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,070
you know?

858
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,650
I mean,

859
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,650
and it was fun.

860
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,670
It was positive.

861
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,470
The fights were fucking great.

862
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:04,940
Joel Lowe's on Jesus Christ.

863
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,550
If I could come back and recycled myself,

864
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:10,600
I come back as Joe Lowe's serious.

865
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,200
I love that Jujitsu Shit like that.

866
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,100
He's a fuck.

867
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:13,401
I love.

868
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:15,800
Everything he did was awesome
and Jamie Varner was awesome.

869
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:16,670
Man.

870
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,290
That guy's making a huge comeback.

871
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,720
He just didn't have enough time to
get into condition for this fight.

872
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:22,170
I think eight weeks,

873
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,790
four weeks.

874
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,060
I think he took it on short notice.

875
00:26:24,061 --> 00:26:24,530
So you know,

876
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,280
it's a tough fight.

877
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,360
Joe Lozan is uh,

878
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,320
it's one of the best.

879
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,180
He's a dangerous kid.

880
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:30,170
He's got a lot of tools.

881
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,150
One thing I love about Joe Lowe's on
is when they match them up just by Uli,

882
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,680
like if they match up against
somebody who's a great striker,

883
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,400
does striker,

884
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,490
I know Joe loads and that
hasn't been a chance of winning.

885
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,530
This is the craziest drilling
because if you hit you,

886
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,070
gets on his

887
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,341
back,

888
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:45,480
he attack you from his back.

889
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,590
He don't give a fuck.

890
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:47,910
He said he fucked up a couple of people.

891
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:48,610
Let me get a,

892
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,590
and Gallard too.

893
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:49,981
Yeah.

894
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:50,580
He got up and go.

895
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,031
I can do that.

896
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:51,841
Jumping and screaming.

897
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:52,621
He fucking did keep,

898
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:55,500
Melvin keeps talking like saying
that Joe Lowe's on got lucky.

899
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:57,270
But let me tell you something.

900
00:26:57,271 --> 00:27:01,200
When someone wants to punch you in the
face and they do punch you in the face,

901
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,250
that's not luck.

902
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:02,761
Okay.

903
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:04,860
That's what he wanted to
do and that's what he did.

904
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,230
It ain't no lucky punches.

905
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,770
Did you just say it's a lucky punch is
one of the craziest things people could

906
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:15,150
ever say when you rush in like that
like he did with his face exposed with a

907
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:16,020
good fighter,

908
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:18,030
a guy is going to snap off a jam on you.

909
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:21,480
I think you probably
underestimated Lozan striking,

910
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:21,661
you know,

911
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:24,540
his striking Melvin's
striking so good and so fast.

912
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,830
He's so fast,

913
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:26,131
man.

914
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:27,990
When you watch him put
combinations together and go,

915
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,720
God damn it's technique just clean.

916
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,870
He's got a lot of power in his hands
and I think he just got a little

917
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:38,871
overconfident in Lozan is not to be
fucked with like 44 fights or something.

918
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:39,923
Those on is obese.

919
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:40,231
Dude,

920
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:41,250
that was an awesome fight.

921
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:42,000
He's smart.

922
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,790
That's the most dangerous thing
about Joe Lowe's on is he's smart.

923
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:45,780
You know?

924
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,910
And then I'm looking for Anthony.

925
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,710
Anthony Pettis just knocked Joe
Lowe's on the out in the first round,

926
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:50,460
their fight,

927
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:50,761
you know,

928
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:51,750
and he hasn't fought since then.

929
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:53,250
I'm looking forward to
seeing him fight again.

930
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,900
I think you've got an injured though.

931
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,183
Pedes.

932
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,000
Yeah,

933
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,210
it's,

934
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,460
they're trying to set something up with
him at cowboy Cerrone of Serone gets by

935
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:01,294
Gallard.

936
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,660
Even if he doesn't your bike go
out and still be a great fine,

937
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,620
and my man got her caught check us out
or it gets Ellenberger he's got a disc

938
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,790
bulging disc.

939
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,740
But dog this week,

940
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:09,910
God,

941
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,681
people always like,

942
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:12,030
why are these fighters getting injured?

943
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:12,571
Well,

944
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:14,480
they're in the business of their,

945
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,340
their business is getting really
good at fucking people up.

946
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,203
That's what they're doing.

947
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,300
So in the only way to get really good
at fucking be blocked because you got to

948
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:25,020
practice fucking people up all day and
while you're practicing fucking people

949
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:25,161
up,

950
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,040
people get fucked up.

951
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,851
Did you fuck you?

952
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:27,740
How happy were you?

953
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,051
I mean,

954
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:29,190
it's an impartial.

955
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,250
I was happy as fuck and I
gave him a lot of respect.

956
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:33,084
Mike's wick.

957
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,043
Oh my God,

958
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,320
we gotta respect seven one
mother bucket three bitches.

959
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,610
And I'll tell you what before that,

960
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:39,820
demarcus look fantastic.

961
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:41,960
Yeah,

962
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,481
you just caught,

963
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:42,821
caught him.

964
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:43,621
Perfect man.

965
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:46,170
When he caught that leg and
drop that right hand on it,

966
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:46,411
man,

967
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:47,910
it was perfect placement.

968
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,350
He did it so fast.

969
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:50,310
Like demarcus just,

970
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,121
just,

971
00:28:51,121 --> 00:28:53,490
he just went out with that
first shot and then switched,

972
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:54,930
tagged him two more times for the ref.

973
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,790
Got to him like a fucking karate kid.

974
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,080
And Beta was a great fight.

975
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:58,914
Dude.

976
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,900
Liotta Machida is scary guy.

977
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,280
You gotta you gotta get,

978
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,560
you gotta get ahold of that guy and it's,

979
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,820
that's no picnic either.

980
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:08,100
He just got great wrestling
and great use of his body.

981
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,990
He did a lot of sumo when he was a kid,

982
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,070
which sounds silly,

983
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:11,430
right?

984
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,660
So,

985
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,450
but they,

986
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,081
they really,

987
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:16,320
they're really good at like throwing
people off in certain directions and

988
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,370
pushing forward and,

989
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,780
and planting yourself.

990
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:19,230
And,

991
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:19,441
you know,

992
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:19,770
he's,

993
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,720
he's got amazing tricks that he does
inside with like little leg trips and shit

994
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,554
like that.

995
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,030
It'd be interesting to see,

996
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:27,390
uh,

997
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:27,870
him,

998
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,250
uh,

999
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,730
versus look if he,

1000
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,120
if Henderson somehow or another beats
Jon Jones seeing him the Oda Machida

1001
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:36,150
versus Henderson,

1002
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,580
I would really like to see that fight.

1003
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,050
That would be crazy.

1004
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,930
I would love to that fight because
they're both kind of on the small side for

1005
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:44,764
light heavyweight,

1006
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,400
the Oda way to oh one Henderson's
usually somewhere around there.

1007
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,270
Even when he fights it,

1008
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:49,781
two oh five,

1009
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:51,820
he usually weighs around 200 ish.

1010
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,660
You know,

1011
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,670
I think that would be an incredible fight.

1012
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,170
Henderson Jones is going to be a
crazy fight to man if Henderson wins.

1013
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,020
He's like the greatest mixed
martial arts fighter of all time.

1014
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,950
If you really look at it,

1015
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,990
if you look at it like as
far as accomplishments,

1016
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,040
they've got wins.

1017
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,640
Two different titles in pride in
two different weight classes at,

1018
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,250
and then he holds them at the same time.

1019
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,450
It comes over to strike force.

1020
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,810
When's the title and strike for us?

1021
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,360
He has,

1022
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,120
he's a knockout over heavyweights.

1023
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,040
Like fate or million.

1024
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,700
ENCO got knocked out fatal.

1025
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,883
You know what I mean?

1026
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,030
Dan Henderson is a mother fucker dude.

1027
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,560
That guy is a motherfucker.

1028
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,670
You can never sleep on that.

1029
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,260
Let's see if he figures out Jon Jones,

1030
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,440
if he fit the fingers on anybody.

1031
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:31,751
Man,

1032
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:32,584
he's got that.

1033
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,040
He's got that one weapon
that's so retarded.

1034
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:36,820
Strong.

1035
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,170
His right hand is so powerful and he has
this crazy confidence in it and he can

1036
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:41,920
takes it.

1037
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,600
He takes an amazing shot.

1038
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,740
He's so tough.

1039
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,150
So he'll wade through some shit to get
to you and clip you with that thing and

1040
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:51,070
just put the lights out.

1041
00:30:51,071 --> 00:30:51,700
Man.

1042
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,930
He's dangerous man.

1043
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,270
He's fucking dangerous.

1044
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,570
And I think he's more dangerous at
two oh five and he hasn't won 85.

1045
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,100
I think especially as you get older,

1046
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:02,200
it's hard for a guy like
that to cuddle that weight.

1047
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:02,921
You know?

1048
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:06,250
I think when he doesn't cut weight and
he's one of the rare guys that can do it.

1049
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,170
If fights effectively at two oh five.

1050
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,150
And I think when he doesn't cut that way,

1051
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,991
I think maybe,

1052
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:11,230
uh,

1053
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,400
maybe he feels a little bit healthier
at a so many a years of doing that shit.

1054
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,641
Man.

1055
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,500
That's like one of the
worst aspects of fighting.

1056
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,334
It's the weight cutting.

1057
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,700
Sad drives me nuts because it's,

1058
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,030
the sport is always supposed
to be about being healthy.

1059
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,410
It's supposed to be about,

1060
00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:26,651
you know,

1061
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:31,651
like you know your body being tuned in
in the best possible way for combat,

1062
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,540
but it's really not because of
the 24 hours before you fight,

1063
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,990
you fuck it up hard core,

1064
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,980
you suck all the water out of it so you
could flight in a lower weight class.

1065
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:46,360
It's this weird fucking silly
thing that's still around.

1066
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,591
It shouldn't,

1067
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:48,940
it shouldn't be a factor.

1068
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:49,780
It should be.

1069
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:50,651
It really,

1070
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:51,484
honestly,

1071
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,860
it is a part of the sport is probably no
getting rid of it at this point without

1072
00:31:56,861 --> 00:31:59,770
some sort of a radical restructuring
of the way people look at martial arts.

1073
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,320
But I think that it's almost like it's,

1074
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,210
it's not in the proper spirit
of martial arts and competition.

1075
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,343
I feel like,

1076
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,210
I feel like you have to do it today if
you're a professional because everyone's

1077
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:15,670
doing it and if you want to
fight against guys your size,

1078
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:16,810
there's only one way to do that.

1079
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:18,070
You're going to have to fight against.

1080
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:18,671
You know,

1081
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:20,050
you're going to have to
fight against the scales.

1082
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:20,351
Well,

1083
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:23,110
you're going to have to cut weight and
you're going to have to go in because

1084
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:24,010
everybody else is doing it.

1085
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,150
Otherwise you're not going to win.

1086
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:29,200
You're not going to beat 190 pound guy
if you really wait one 70 if he's just as

1087
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:30,034
skilled as you,

1088
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,551
you know,

1089
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:31,720
that extra 20 pounds,

1090
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:35,860
even though it fucked his organs up and
might have almost shut it's kidney down

1091
00:32:35,861 --> 00:32:38,470
and he had to get reinflated with Ivs.

1092
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,860
He's probably still gonna beat you

1093
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,350
because he's a bigger guy
and he's got more mass,

1094
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,540
especially if you can get you to
the ground and have more space,

1095
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,160
more strength of,

1096
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:46,521
more,

1097
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:47,690
more to push around.

1098
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,120
And when they refuel themselves
with ivy and he's like,

1099
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:52,340
they can do it pretty well with Ivs,

1100
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:53,720
we're in 24 hours,

1101
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,321
you know,

1102
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:55,370
it's worth it for them,

1103
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,260
but it's still bad for your body.

1104
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,840
And it's unfortunate and I think I,

1105
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,000
I hate the idea that those
people have to do that,

1106
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,013
you know,

1107
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,303
sucks.

1108
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,360
What are you going to do?

1109
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,500
It's part of the fucking game.

1110
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:07,250
You know what I'm saying?

1111
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:07,551
Yeah.

1112
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:09,590
We've got to go to a
Starbucks and write jokes.

1113
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:10,670
They got to lose fucking white.

1114
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,181
I know,

1115
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:13,520
but wouldn't it be better if they
all just fought their way class,

1116
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:13,870
I think,

1117
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:18,870
which I think a perfect utopia of mixed
martial arts would be everybody fights

1118
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:22,250
in one of the fuck their way and
we find out what everybody waves.

1119
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,130
We just naturally you get this is
what you weigh when you're in shape.

1120
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:25,431
What do you,

1121
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:26,360
what do you weigh when you're like,

1122
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:26,810
uh,

1123
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,220
like when dog fighting shape,

1124
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:29,300
when they used to fight dogs,

1125
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,650
you know that he used to weigh him in.

1126
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,090
Do you know that shit now?

1127
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:32,910
Yeah.

1128
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,330
The,

1129
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,400
the really light ones.

1130
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:35,300
Just the ones they want.

1131
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,480
You don't like see these big giant
pit bulls that everybody has today.

1132
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,230
These people have bred these things
to make them really big and crazy.

1133
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,620
But I had a friend who had like
one of the really small game once.

1134
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:46,361
It was crazy,

1135
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:47,330
a little animal man.

1136
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,110
It was a really smart,

1137
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,390
they don't even have to look
like if they're really small.

1138
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,680
It was like 35 pounds.

1139
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,310
Are you serious?

1140
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:55,550
No,

1141
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,111
barely have.

1142
00:33:56,111 --> 00:33:57,770
Basically you can get a 20 pounds,

1143
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,670
25 pound pit bull.

1144
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,070
There's a really small ones,

1145
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:01,971
but those little,

1146
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:03,560
little tiny ones are crazy.

1147
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,420
They don't look like pit bulls.

1148
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:06,110
Like where would,

1149
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,780
we're used to seeing them
with like the really boxy,

1150
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,590
muscular heads and huge shoulders.

1151
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,280
Like those are the pitfalls
you see on the streets.

1152
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,810
The amazing looking dogs,

1153
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,720
the ones that you use an angel
heart to bite Mickey Rourke,

1154
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,580
the two little fucking pit bulls and New
Orleans watch that movie with a little

1155
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,381
real little ones.

1156
00:34:22,381 --> 00:34:23,191
We'll look at them and go,

1157
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:23,451
oh,

1158
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:23,961
that's weird.

1159
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:27,440
It was 87 so nobody really knew about
the fucking pit bull who was still stuck

1160
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:30,950
on Goldman pinches retrievers some.

1161
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:31,370
Yeah,

1162
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,730
some people know about and they made
that movie when they sent the mob guy to

1163
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:35,750
beat him up in that movie,

1164
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:36,540
the devil,

1165
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,210
whether it beats him up in Angel Heart,

1166
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,260
that's what he had.

1167
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,860
These little tiny pimples that we didn't
even have a big chest when they fucking

1168
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:43,694
ran after him.

1169
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,380
You could even see they ran different,

1170
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:48,950
like it was the beginning before they
started giving him juice and gun powder.

1171
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,170
Do you know at one point in
time the pit bull was like a,

1172
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:52,730
the the,

1173
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,850
they were trying to argue for
it being the national animal.

1174
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,600
Like instead of the ego representation
of America was going to be a pit bull.

1175
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,240
Pretty lucky.

1176
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,073
Yeah.

1177
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:01,790
Yeah.

1178
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,121
There was a,

1179
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:03,370
there was a movement for that.

1180
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,530
I got that movement like
three guys and Compton.

1181
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,790
It was pretty legit.

1182
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:08,060
Man.

1183
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,893
I

1184
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,720
wish her neck remember this.

1185
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:15,554
Totally.

1186
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,230
But I haven't had pit bulls in the
year and so I've forgotten all the

1187
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,123
propaganda.

1188
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,593
Um,

1189
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,170
uh,

1190
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,230
American animal,

1191
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,121
by the way.

1192
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,340
Tonight we have an amazing
show at the ice house.

1193
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,440
There's still some tickets left.

1194
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,200
Yeah.

1195
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,910
How many are left?

1196
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,710
I think there's like 40.

1197
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,401
Okay.

1198
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:31,730
It's,

1199
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,900
if you've ever been there,

1200
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,050
the ice houses one of the
best clubs in the world,

1201
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:36,870
isn't it?

1202
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:37,540
Joey was,

1203
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,040
how great is

1204
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,873
that fucking place?

1205
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,220
I don't give a fuck if they
did this show in a barn.

1206
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,470
You fucking Moses,

1207
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,380
Dom Irrera,

1208
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,491
Tom Road,

1209
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:45,301
Joe Rogan,

1210
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:46,200
Doug Benson,

1211
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,470
and fucking red man.

1212
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,600
Same Shit and cancel.

1213
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:54,630
What the fuck you don't tell
your grandmother some indic
call (626) 577-1836 and

1214
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:57,241
get those tickets.

1215
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:59,250
Now I'm talking about Tom Road.

1216
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,360
Joe Rogan,

1217
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,850
a fucking IRA and dug beds.

1218
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:04,883
Bert Kreischer,

1219
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,940
just those four.

1220
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,820
It's like 50 and a blowjob
to fucking get the pocket.

1221
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,230
So get your shit together.

1222
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:13,050
You're fucking most showing the ice house.

1223
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:13,890
That shouldn't be sold.

1224
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,090
I'm in Orange County,

1225
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,210
but it ain't going to fucking get back on.

1226
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,380
And then I will get back to about 1130
12 I'm going to a sandwich place to land

1227
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,580
in Orange County named Roscoe's to
fucking excited about a sandwich.

1228
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:27,530
No,

1229
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:27,621
no,

1230
00:36:27,621 --> 00:36:27,770
no,

1231
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:27,991
I'm not.

1232
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:28,980
I'm not excited about it.

1233
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:33,510
As much as they do comedy at this
sandwich place now and they serve beer.

1234
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,680
They had beer and wine,

1235
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,550
no booze,

1236
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,350
but it's fucking sandwiches,

1237
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:41,090
like old school sandwiches and you go
down and you'd do fucking 30 minutes.

1238
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:44,040
They give you a little doll pumper
nickles and they get the fuck out of it.

1239
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:44,551
You know what I'm saying?

1240
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:44,841
That's it.

1241
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:48,330
But I like to think got like 90 a hundred
people and it's really fucking cool.

1242
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,081
But on the way back,

1243
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:49,771
I'll stop up there.

1244
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:51,440
I'll try to shoot the one on one too.

1245
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:52,200
Fucking hot.

1246
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,861
That's what it is,

1247
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:53,520
dog.

1248
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,271
This is brutal.

1249
00:36:54,271 --> 00:36:55,980
If I got one on a plane Friday cup,

1250
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,380
it's going to be a hundred
motherfucking 10 on Friday.

1251
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,800
It was 13 or 13 or something like that.

1252
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,050
Just on my way here mean listen,

1253
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,180
they said that this July was the
hottest July ever in the country.

1254
00:37:09,181 --> 00:37:10,270
The whole country ever.

1255
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,041
Okay.

1256
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:13,380
That's all the untrue ever.

1257
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,120
I know they did.

1258
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,830
They talked about it in La.

1259
00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:18,150
I tweeted it today.

1260
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:19,860
I retweeted it cause it was ridiculous.

1261
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:23,250
It's pretty bad when I have to leave my
air conditioning on full blast at home

1262
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:24,870
just so my cats don't die.

1263
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,733
Yeah,

1264
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:26,310
yeah,

1265
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,881
you do,

1266
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:27,270
right?

1267
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,920
Yeah,

1268
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,230
you're there.

1269
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,641
It's hard.

1270
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:29,790
It's fuck around on the floor.

1271
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,870
They haven't fucking mood.

1272
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,441
No beds,

1273
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:34,440
no nothing there on the floor
getting that fucking cool.

1274
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:37,600
Would I last night in my bedroom
I couldn't get it freezing.

1275
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,130
It's usually freezing cold but
it wasn't freezing last night.

1276
00:37:41,131 --> 00:37:42,540
It was cold enough for me to fall asleep,

1277
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:44,610
but I got up to pee like at four of them.

1278
00:37:44,611 --> 00:37:45,750
Like what the fuck is this?

1279
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,870
Usually I got the blanket on her.

1280
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,123
That's weird.

1281
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,940
Fucking they glue.

1282
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,140
But last night was,

1283
00:37:52,141 --> 00:37:52,621
it's tough.

1284
00:37:52,621 --> 00:37:53,730
It's been a hot fucking weekend.

1285
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:58,340
And you didn't feel the earthquake last
night I was at flappers and then on the

1286
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,790
one I was driving home I seen all the
cop cars and then when I came in people

1287
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:03,870
were on Facebook.

1288
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,531
There was an earthquake.

1289
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:05,400
I don't feel that shit.

1290
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,200
A lot of people called me a pussy because
I felt that I wasn't at the Ice House

1291
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,460
and it was like a huge jolt and then like
a sway in the whole building made like

1292
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:17,280
this crackly noise and I'm like okay,

1293
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:21,690
I'm getting the fuck out of here because
this building is way like building some

1294
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,070
check,

1295
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:22,561
check to,

1296
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:23,310
you know,

1297
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:23,740
it's not,

1298
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,470
if you look they have those things
already in the walls or retrofits.

1299
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,810
We have 50 it's like the outside of it.

1300
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:31,800
It's just retrofit,

1301
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:32,221
retrofit,

1302
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:32,641
retrofit.

1303
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:33,120
Retrofit.

1304
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,500
So I'm thinking if I'm gonna,

1305
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,160
if there's ever an earthquake here,

1306
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,290
run the fuck out of this building.

1307
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,040
Might collapse.

1308
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,310
Yeah.

1309
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,850
It might collapse billings

1310
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,263
bricks.

1311
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,700
That's why it's not that the
bricks are going to fall apart,

1312
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:49,840
but they shift or that shift
because you hear that shit.

1313
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,230
Yeah,

1314
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,520
that is traumatizing.

1315
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,470
And so it looked at Hollywood.

1316
00:38:53,471 --> 00:38:55,250
I live in a brick building kind of.

1317
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,120
Couple of people were calling me
pussies and stuff like on Twitter.

1318
00:38:58,121 --> 00:38:59,410
Me Like you're a pussy,

1319
00:38:59,411 --> 00:38:59,771
pussy,

1320
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:00,250
you know?

1321
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:00,700
And I'm like,

1322
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,270
all right,

1323
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,370
you could be in Malibu,

1324
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,160
which is a lot farther
away from where I was at,

1325
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:06,611
you know,

1326
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:07,870
to the earthquake and be like,

1327
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,291
oh yeah,

1328
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:09,930
I didn't feel anything you pussy,

1329
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,420
you know?

1330
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:10,961
But that would,

1331
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:13,090
I felt last night was fucking jolting.

1332
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:13,924
That was like,

1333
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:14,680
oh,

1334
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,190
I didn't feel,

1335
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,780
I forgot there's earth.

1336
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,570
This is earthquake stuff
just underneath me.

1337
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,673
Yes.

1338
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,350
Yeah.

1339
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,250
It gets so hot.

1340
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:28,810
I am only hoping that since nobody ever
predicts things correctly that because

1341
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:29,770
you're saying it's earthquake,

1342
00:39:29,771 --> 00:39:30,820
whatever that you're wrong.

1343
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,331
Well,

1344
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:32,620
it's because it's so hot.

1345
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,371
It's so hot.

1346
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,330
And that's why the earthquake last night
happened around 10 at night or whatever

1347
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,980
because the ground gets so fucking hot
and then at night it gets cold and that,

1348
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:42,520
that con,

1349
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,060
you know,

1350
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,930
shift shift.

1351
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,413
That's earthquake,

1352
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,260
earthquake,

1353
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,791
seasoning.

1354
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:49,690
That's what it's made of.

1355
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,130
Like hot and cold.

1356
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,113
Neil degrasse

1357
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,043
Tyson.

1358
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,300
I'm going to try to get
that dude on the pod coast.

1359
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,420
Neil degrasse Tyson.

1360
00:39:56,421 --> 00:39:58,820
The scientists were going back and forth.

1361
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,900
Get Mr Wizzard,

1362
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:00,870
Mr Wizzard,

1363
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,150
who's at,

1364
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,270
I would love that dude.

1365
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,760
Mr Wizards ruin.

1366
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,970
I'm going to get doctor Steve too from
the opie and Anthony Channel guys.

1367
00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:08,770
Fascinating.

1368
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,650
He listened to his show the other day
on Sirius and I found out why chocolate

1369
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:13,484
kills dogs.

1370
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,973
It's the caffeine.

1371
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,850
It's a caffeine and chocolate.

1372
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,820
Apparently chocolate has caffeine in
it and the caffeine and chocolate.

1373
00:40:19,821 --> 00:40:21,440
Just Jack's dogs' bodies,

1374
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,830
so don't give your dog Starbucks or cat.

1375
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,290
Right?

1376
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,550
Give me a cat chocolate.

1377
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,250
Yeah.

1378
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:26,401
Yeah.

1379
00:40:26,401 --> 00:40:31,070
That's good to know because my daughter
told me there's something else you can't

1380
00:40:31,071 --> 00:40:32,630
give it to you and John Rollo.

1381
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,670
Most unlikely cat owners ever,

1382
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:37,640
I guess meet to a lot of people get
talked to John Rollo all the time about

1383
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:37,910
cats.

1384
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:38,511
He's excited.

1385
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:39,710
He just got something else to do.

1386
00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:40,110
It got to,

1387
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,090
he just got something else.

1388
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,140
He's got the billboards.

1389
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:42,973
I'm going to go see him.

1390
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:43,371
Yeah,

1391
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:44,950
he's a criminal to go
to Baltimore and Sam.

1392
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,220
So I'm pretty excited.

1393
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:47,481
Yeah.

1394
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:49,520
We haven't had a UFC in that area.

1395
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,950
We haven't done like a Baltimore USA.

1396
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,540
Baltimore's aren't doing so good.

1397
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:54,374
Right.

1398
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,640
You know,

1399
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,020
when I first got into comedy,

1400
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:00,000
one of the clubs that gave me working
for them see was a Baltimore Club.

1401
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,130
Remember the Improv down there?

1402
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,840
Did you ever do that?

1403
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,420
No.

1404
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,253
They had a good Improv,

1405
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,470
their improv down in this kind of
crazy area where there's like a lot of

1406
00:41:06,471 --> 00:41:07,304
different clubs.

1407
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,301
You know,

1408
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:09,600
it's like this little,

1409
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,493
uh,

1410
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,080
little patches of,

1411
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,830
of fun places in this world where people
figured out how to do something right.

1412
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,790
But there's something cool about when
you go to a place and like all these

1413
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:22,570
different places all empty
out into a common place,

1414
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,870
like a courtyard area.

1415
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,610
As long as everybody can
keep their shit together.

1416
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,823
Baltimore,

1417
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:27,740
that's also,

1418
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,311
I think,

1419
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:31,910
wasn't it that the same place where that
dude got knocked unconscious and they

1420
00:41:31,911 --> 00:41:33,980
fucking filmed it and
they took his clothes

1421
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,620
off and made a video of it.

1422
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,530
It wasn't that Baltimore,

1423
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,653
I think it was,

1424
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,870
they shot the wire there.

1425
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,150
They shot the wire that,

1426
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,590
yeah.

1427
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:41,820
Yeah.

1428
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,710
Boston was duly fucking duty.

1429
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,610
Fucking city.

1430
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:45,883
Yeah.

1431
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,690
They got some wild shit to the stadium,

1432
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,760
the stadium and a couple of times,

1433
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:52,250
great big government is going
to want to disarm Baltimore.

1434
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:52,911
Yeah.

1435
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:54,170
That's some crazy motherfuckers.

1436
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:54,771
Baltimore,

1437
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:55,604
Philadelphia.

1438
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,840
That's where those,

1439
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,060
that's where you give those people guns
cause they'll shoot anybody Delphia

1440
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,150
don't feel it's the only stadium.

1441
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:04,610
If they had a fucking jail in the stadium,

1442
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:05,450
the football stadium,

1443
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,221
I hate.

1444
00:42:06,221 --> 00:42:06,811
Did you see that?

1445
00:42:06,811 --> 00:42:08,030
That that coach got uh,

1446
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:08,960
uh,

1447
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,340
you know,

1448
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:09,530
uh,

1449
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,570
my condolences to the
guy from Philadelphia,

1450
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:12,170
that culture,

1451
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:12,621
Ryan,

1452
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:13,454
his son died.

1453
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,530
He was on our fucking
show couple of years ago,

1454
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:16,280
Bro.

1455
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,120
He was on a show.

1456
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,800
That kid came to our show.

1457
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,580
The kid who just died there,

1458
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,490
the coach of the Philadelphia Eagles,

1459
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,640
he came to our show.

1460
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,780
Him was in talking towards the
back room and that Atlantic city,

1461
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:27,711
that was when,

1462
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,220
uh,

1463
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:28,611
the guy,

1464
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:30,910
Tim Silvia and um,

1465
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,191
uh,

1466
00:42:31,191 --> 00:42:31,701
what's his name?

1467
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:33,550
The coach from Iowa and uh,

1468
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,100
uh,

1469
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:34,850
the Pharma,

1470
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,710
they will all down there
cause somebody was fighting.

1471
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,100
Yeah,

1472
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,933
we went done.

1473
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:41,900
IFL went down it and we show
that weekend when I got on stage,

1474
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:43,850
he came up to me all juiced up the kid.

1475
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:44,901
It's like dog,

1476
00:42:44,901 --> 00:42:45,531
whatever you need,

1477
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:46,490
we got you covered here.

1478
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,650
My father is the coach
of the fucking Egos.

1479
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:50,330
All I got to do is make a call bench.

1480
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,100
So the other day when I saw that,

1481
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:52,521
I was like,

1482
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:52,821
wow,

1483
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:53,654
that kid,

1484
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,040
unless he has other kids.

1485
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:55,551
But that was,

1486
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:55,760
yeah,

1487
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,680
the shirt and a hat and he was very young.

1488
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,050
So my condolences to the fucking,

1489
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:00,884
Nah,

1490
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,700
I don't remember.

1491
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,750
We're looking down in the crowd and
Henzel Gracie was there laughing his ass

1492
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:06,080
off.

1493
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,920
Asked to place.

1494
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,521
Yeah.

1495
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:08,354
Okay.

1496
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,720
That was when the IFL and Enzo
was something to do with the IFL.

1497
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,390
Like a lot of us went,

1498
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,680
Hari the IFL was an interesting idea.

1499
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:20,210
Just he can't take the whole team thing.

1500
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,930
It's an individual sport.

1501
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,230
The whole team thing really didn't work.

1502
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,190
It's like stand up,

1503
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:25,821
it's just me.

1504
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:26,840
You went to Mike Bench,

1505
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:27,870
you can't do,

1506
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,000
teams are standing up,

1507
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,670
you come in and we tag team
me and you should say that.

1508
00:43:31,671 --> 00:43:33,590
But we kind of do have a team.

1509
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,060
We're the team death squad.

1510
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,073
I mean,

1511
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,733
right.

1512
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:38,990
That's,

1513
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,130
that's it is a team.

1514
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:40,731
You know,

1515
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:41,900
if you were really thinking about it,

1516
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:46,040
all the people that we have in our inner
circle that we considered a lot writing

1517
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:46,874
secrets.

1518
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:47,600
Yeah.

1519
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,201
You should do.

1520
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:48,740
Don't do it.

1521
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,250
Yeah.

1522
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,480
I mean it's kind of like a team,

1523
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,230
you know?

1524
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,280
I mean if anybody is,

1525
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,950
in most cases standup is not like that.

1526
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,150
But with us,

1527
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,780
I think a stand,

1528
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,210
this is very much like a whole,

1529
00:43:59,211 --> 00:44:02,810
a whole group of us were all
identified by our friends,

1530
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:04,543
you know,

1531
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:05,700
Holla,

1532
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,533
Holla.

1533
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:10,040
So now we got Denver this
week and we got Vegas.

1534
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:13,880
Frankie motherfucking that God
gets Henderson Donald's wrong.

1535
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,860
I took good fucking car to Joe Rogan.

1536
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,030
That's a great car down there.

1537
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:17,960
I'm going,

1538
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,890
you don't make dog.

1539
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,113
Uh,

1540
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,820
there's certain people you want in your
life and there's certain people you

1541
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:23,690
don't want in your life.

1542
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,730
I don't ever want to Brown with Frankie.

1543
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:26,300
I go,

1544
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,133
I love that guy.

1545
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,600
I liked Henderson and

1546
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,330
the fucking time when he grabs his leg
and he jumps up and throws that kick.

1547
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:34,711
Yeah,

1548
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:35,544
he's fun.

1549
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:36,420
He's is let it gets,

1550
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:36,841
can be,

1551
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,370
but he's got ridiculous legs.

1552
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,840
It's got legs for like a 185
pounder when he's 155 pound guy.

1553
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,040
He's got weird legs.

1554
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:45,160
He's,

1555
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,740
he's just a bad motherfucker.

1556
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,491
Tough,

1557
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:47,971
tough kid,

1558
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:48,390
man.

1559
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:49,410
He fights really good.

1560
00:44:49,411 --> 00:44:51,090
God's and it makes them look not so good,

1561
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:51,590
you know?

1562
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:51,920
I mean,

1563
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,520
he keeps doing it over and over again.

1564
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:54,720
You know?

1565
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,390
I also saw that fucking cut til my man,

1566
00:44:57,391 --> 00:44:58,290
Rory Macdonald,

1567
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,603
Toronto,

1568
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,380
huge 30 something stitches.

1569
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,550
I want to see a rematch,

1570
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:08,040
a pennys and a and Benson Henderson to,

1571
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:08,971
Oh shit.

1572
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:09,800
That was great.

1573
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,620
A great fight.

1574
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,230
And you know how much Henderson
would get up for that rematch.

1575
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,760
But this fight this weekend,

1576
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:16,410
it's going to be amazing
cause I'll tell you what,

1577
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:17,340
that Edgar Kid,

1578
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,730
Frankie Edgar finds a way that
motherfucker finds a mine.

1579
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,870
He's a little dog.

1580
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,570
He's got a mind that is like,

1581
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:25,710
he don't like losing,

1582
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,260
you know,

1583
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:26,520
and,

1584
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,080
and he comes back stronger.

1585
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,640
He comes back stronger than ever.

1586
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,230
He should see you lead guy.

1587
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:32,640
He looks fucking rain man.

1588
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:35,220
Up to eight dribbler like
what the fuck's rain man?

1589
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,180
And you want to giggle?

1590
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,890
He said about who likes you to fuck up?

1591
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,551
He's a bad mother.

1592
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:39,750
I just watched him as great.

1593
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,010
Made it the second one.

1594
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:41,820
The third one again.

1595
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,270
The other,

1596
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:43,000
yeah.

1597
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,550
You gotta be able to
keep that pace up too,

1598
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:45,210
man.

1599
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,530
You gotta be able to keep pace with him.

1600
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:47,611
He'll,

1601
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:50,040
he'll drag you into some deep
fucking conditioning water.

1602
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:50,610
You know,

1603
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,740
that guy can do that
for an hour and a half.

1604
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,341
He's,

1605
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:55,290
he's one of the best
condition guys in the sport.

1606
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,930
And one of the reasons for that
is what we talked about earlier.

1607
00:45:57,931 --> 00:45:59,250
Frankie Edgar doesn't cut.

1608
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,860
That guy weighs 155 pounds.

1609
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:02,580
I love it.

1610
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,080
I love it when he can win.

1611
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,340
I love it when he can win,

1612
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,180
but when,

1613
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,090
when he loses and he loses
because of guys bigger than him,

1614
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:10,050
it makes you think like,

1615
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:10,411
man,

1616
00:46:10,411 --> 00:46:11,244
I wish.

1617
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:16,320
I wish you could do it at one 55 I hope
you can do it at one 55 but you know,

1618
00:46:16,321 --> 00:46:18,450
maybe one 45 is your
weight class closet songs.

1619
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:23,451
He goes to talk 45 that could be one of
the greatest fights him against fucking,

1620
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:24,750
I'll go,

1621
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:24,910
oh,

1622
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,231
command.

1623
00:46:25,231 --> 00:46:26,490
I've said that to this day one.

1624
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,510
I'm pushing for it.

1625
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:27,901
I love it.

1626
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:30,150
At one 45 in Vegas,

1627
00:46:30,151 --> 00:46:30,630
something,

1628
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:30,880
you know,

1629
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,830
you can't count them out,

1630
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:32,011
man.

1631
00:46:32,011 --> 00:46:32,630
You can't count.

1632
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:32,991
Oh No,

1633
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:33,120
no,

1634
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:33,261
no,

1635
00:46:33,261 --> 00:46:33,630
no.

1636
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,310
Knock him out by any
stretch of imagination.

1637
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,410
That kid like I can win,

1638
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:36,750
man.

1639
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,890
I don't want him in my future
and my past him for you,

1640
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:40,691
you don't need that.

1641
00:46:40,691 --> 00:46:41,520
And you're fucking white,

1642
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:41,821
man.

1643
00:46:41,821 --> 00:46:43,560
I don't need that shit in my fucking life.

1644
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,420
I love the fact that if I,

1645
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:47,610
if I see him and then I
see him six months later,

1646
00:46:47,611 --> 00:46:49,470
I look forward to seeing what,

1647
00:46:49,471 --> 00:46:50,430
what's improved,

1648
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:50,791
what's,

1649
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:52,800
what's gotten better because
it's going to be better.

1650
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,580
He's going to be better.

1651
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,600
It's going to do something better.

1652
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:56,760
He's going to have some
move that you didn't expect.

1653
00:46:56,761 --> 00:46:57,041
Common.

1654
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:59,000
Some lead right hand that
you didn't see coming.

1655
00:46:59,001 --> 00:46:59,834
He's going to shift his,

1656
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,770
his was wait a little bit differently.

1657
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:02,820
He's going to do something better.

1658
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,680
He's going to have a little
bit more conditioning.

1659
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,140
He's not like an asshole,

1660
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:06,621
you know,

1661
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:08,220
it takes time off and gets fat.

1662
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:11,390
That's 40 years at genes.

1663
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,920
Those kids from down the
shore of just scrapping,

1664
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:17,770
scrapping because the other half is
the Guido's and all that stability,

1665
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,910
but the other half of a lot of people
don't know is those kids have to go to

1666
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:22,170
like brick township.

1667
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:26,010
Like what Mike Dolce when they got to
go to these schools and they group for

1668
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:26,844
schools,

1669
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:27,930
group for schools.

1670
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:32,931
You play black schools that I was six
foot four and his Frankie Edgar wrestling

1671
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:35,890
against these schools and they
wrestle it weight categories,

1672
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:36,724
but it's the same day.

1673
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:41,020
If Frankie wrestled at one 35 that guy
that he wrestled against was a lot bigger

1674
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:41,130
than,

1675
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,010
you know what I'm saying?

1676
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,660
Wrestling was the most ridiculous.

1677
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:45,480
Those guys from up,

1678
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:49,720
the kids I grew up with would go down
south and they walk all over that fucking

1679
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:51,550
show up and eventually those kids nights,

1680
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:56,350
40 years of portrait that every summer
they got to fight somebody fucking beggar

1681
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,720
and they do it and the rides down there,

1682
00:47:58,721 --> 00:48:02,740
if you've ever been done that there's a
fight every fucking night and it always

1683
00:48:02,741 --> 00:48:07,270
includes a Guido from up debt against
a regular guy from down there and the

1684
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:09,100
regular guy who always
takes him to fuck off.

1685
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,040
We don't shows up with
his buddies or juice stop,

1686
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,810
take off his shirt.

1687
00:48:13,811 --> 00:48:17,560
I've been training and those guys
down the show like shut the fuck up.

1688
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,790
And he's one of those guys.

1689
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:19,990
I sent it to him all the time.

1690
00:48:19,991 --> 00:48:21,700
Used to light people up and Mr Breakfast,

1691
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,110
that's the hang out down there.

1692
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,780
They all go down there with
no shirts on that goal.

1693
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,250
They breakfast.

1694
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:27,911
How you doing?

1695
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:28,744
How's the advice?

1696
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,120
He's the guys that don't
even work on their legs,

1697
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,413
don't even care.

1698
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:33,970
They don't even care about their stomachs.

1699
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:35,140
Don't care about that lats.

1700
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,760
They just working on their biceps.

1701
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:40,030
That chest and maybe a
little trap is hilarious.

1702
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:43,570
It's hilarious at bay with no supervision.

1703
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:43,980
Vinny,

1704
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,231
Vinny,

1705
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:44,860
come here.

1706
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,790
Hold the fucking needle.

1707
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:46,930
How much am I supposed to put in there?

1708
00:48:46,931 --> 00:48:47,764
I don't know.

1709
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:49,990
Not just fill it up.

1710
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:54,340
How big you want to get out of
fucking my arms be fucking huge.

1711
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,090
You know what I'm saying?

1712
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:56,770
So shoot the whole fucking thing.

1713
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,341
Nah,

1714
00:48:57,341 --> 00:48:58,810
but what if I showed it?

1715
00:48:59,050 --> 00:48:59,471
Shoot it.

1716
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:00,320
We'll get more of them on.

1717
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:00,830
That's how they,

1718
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,050
I don't read instructions.

1719
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,610
They don't read nothing.

1720
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,661
They don't know about.

1721
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:04,991
What's that?

1722
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:05,824
Cycles?

1723
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:06,200
No.

1724
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:06,290
No,

1725
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:06,910
not about psych.

1726
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:07,720
No sites.

1727
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,560
How many of these do I eat?

1728
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:09,423
All of them.

1729
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:11,300
How many in that dirty you to eat?

1730
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:12,143
Like 10 of them.

1731
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,211
Did I go wrong?

1732
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:13,781
You got a headache,

1733
00:49:13,781 --> 00:49:16,630
you know that stem entirely
and they live and they swapped,

1734
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:19,420
blown when they fucking
drink and whatever.

1735
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:20,531
They don't have no.

1736
00:49:20,531 --> 00:49:23,650
You know why we talk about
medications and supervision.

1737
00:49:23,651 --> 00:49:25,540
Just Shit those kids done jersey.

1738
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:26,560
Don't give a fuck about what you know.

1739
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:30,580
In other countries you could just buy
steroids over the counter in like South

1740
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:31,090
America,

1741
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,470
there's a lot of places where you
can just buy sterile Mexico alone.

1742
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,880
These kids go down there
and fuck my de Mexico.

1743
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:36,670
Come on.

1744
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:37,660
That's not even South America.

1745
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:38,540
North America.

1746
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,790
That's crazy.

1747
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,020
That's 65 months,

1748
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:41,854
my friend.

1749
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:42,851
Whatever the fuck it is.

1750
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:43,870
What is it about red ban?

1751
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:46,250
120 miles and we got fucking juice.

1752
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,920
What's crazy is that right Aaron?

1753
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,630
That border,

1754
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,370
you got all this military,

1755
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,150
you got the,

1756
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:52,501
the,

1757
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:53,170
the,

1758
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,270
the air force base or what is it?

1759
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,230
What is down there?

1760
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,063
The Marines.

1761
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,750
The navy's down there cause
the navy and my nephew Mar,

1762
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,593
right.

1763
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:01,911
It's,

1764
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:03,180
it's based on it.

1765
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,520
There's a lot of military down there.

1766
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:07,300
They can put the whole
military down there,

1767
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:09,130
these Mexicans or dig a tunnel here.

1768
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:09,940
But think about that.

1769
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,601
There's all this,

1770
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:11,291
but thinking about this,

1771
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:14,620
all this military and then
surrounding all that military,

1772
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:15,490
you know what it is?

1773
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,230
Some of the richest people on earth and
those people that live on that island,

1774
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,310
Coronado island,

1775
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,250
those are some incredibly wealthy people.

1776
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:26,110
Donald Rumsfeld lives on that island,

1777
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:26,944
Bro.

1778
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,681
Think about that.

1779
00:50:27,681 --> 00:50:27,980
Wrap your

1780
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,760
head around that.

1781
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,200
So this is like super,

1782
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,990
he probably lives in like 10 different
houses all over the world with all the

1783
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:33,824
money he's gotten.

1784
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,330
But uh,

1785
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:35,751
this,

1786
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:35,931
uh,

1787
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:36,980
this one area,

1788
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,341
you,

1789
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:38,061
you go on,

1790
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:40,010
like if you like Google,

1791
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:40,310
um,

1792
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:40,940
real estate,

1793
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,990
like in La Jolla,

1794
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:42,883
like look in the toilet,

1795
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:43,521
the whole thing.

1796
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:44,630
It's amazing,

1797
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,160
amazing,

1798
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:45,993
incredible.

1799
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:47,810
The most spectacular houses,

1800
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:51,680
they increase multi-multi
multimillion dollar houses,

1801
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,030
20 minutes away from Tiawana
is hell 20 minutes away.

1802
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,760
And that's not an exaggeration at all.

1803
00:50:58,761 --> 00:51:03,290
How you can get in your car and you can
literally drive for 20 minutes from San

1804
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:03,291
Diego.

1805
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:04,490
It was crazy beautiful though.

1806
00:51:04,491 --> 00:51:04,761
I mean,

1807
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,350
have you been down there
like on those islands?

1808
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:06,561
Like,

1809
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:09,650
I mean there's no
Olufsen I love San Diego.

1810
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:14,710
Let's get the crazy beautiful San Diego
on the Mexico side is you cross into

1811
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,370
Mexico guys right there.

1812
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:16,700
Yeah.

1813
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,570
That's fucking scary.

1814
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,180
It's scary.

1815
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,780
It goes from the five two dirt roads.

1816
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,160
Well it goes from,

1817
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,120
there's an immediate lack of a,

1818
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:25,430
a feeling of a net.

1819
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:26,181
Okay.

1820
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:29,630
Cause there's a net when you're walking
around in San Diego there's a net of

1821
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:33,370
society and civilization and
culture and like the biggest trust,

1822
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,830
you trust people more like
military base there to protect you.

1823
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,491
I mean you not,

1824
00:51:37,491 --> 00:51:41,090
you don't have the police when you
live there you have like the one of the

1825
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:43,360
biggest military basis
protecting your there.

1826
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,890
So it's safe still to
live there in San Diego.

1827
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,121
No,

1828
00:51:46,121 --> 00:51:46,251
no,

1829
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:47,300
I know for sure but I'm,

1830
00:51:47,301 --> 00:51:50,630
what I'm saying is that when you walk
through to Tiawana there's this feeling

1831
00:51:50,631 --> 00:51:51,980
like the net's been removed.

1832
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:56,600
Like all of a sudden I'm seeing all these
beggars and all this weirdness on the

1833
00:51:56,601 --> 00:51:57,830
street and all these people.

1834
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:58,903
What do you want Joey?

1835
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,410
What are you doing?

1836
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:03,740
Are you looking for your ass
right in front of my face,

1837
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:04,300
bro.

1838
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,133
Respect.

1839
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:06,040
Um,

1840
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:06,350
it's,

1841
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:09,530
it's just that when you
do cross that border,

1842
00:52:09,531 --> 00:52:14,300
it's a very bizarre feeling that you're
only 20 minutes away from the place

1843
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:16,640
where all of the law doesn't apply.

1844
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,600
All of it is gone.

1845
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:18,463
It's all gone.

1846
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,820
And now you have to live with this
rinky dink set of laws from this other

1847
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:23,511
country.

1848
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:24,350
And you know,

1849
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:27,350
you might run into a cop who says that
you were speeding and you just got to

1850
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:29,690
give him money because that's
how they roll down there.

1851
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:30,490
And,

1852
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:34,760
and who knows how many fucking people
are involved in and doing illegal shit,

1853
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,730
moving drugs around and it's
right there 20 minutes away.

1854
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:38,721
I mean,

1855
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:41,600
it's way scarier than
the ghettos in America,

1856
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:42,020
isn't it?

1857
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:42,700
Wouldn't you say that?

1858
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,040
Awana is scarier than most of the ghetto.

1859
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:47,660
Always five minutes away.

1860
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:48,621
But one thing,

1861
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:53,621
I know tons of people that go the Tijuana
all the time and I don't know anybody

1862
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:58,610
that goes to like Harlem and all the time
you really know tons of people who go

1863
00:52:58,611 --> 00:52:59,241
to Tijuana.

1864
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:00,530
All it sound all the time.

1865
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:00,801
Well,

1866
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:01,281
I'll tell you what,

1867
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:04,880
Anthony Bourdain went recently on a
show and I really enjoyed that show.

1868
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:09,881
It was cool because he met with a lot of
cool Mexicans that live in Tijuana that

1869
00:53:10,101 --> 00:53:13,250
were like sort of giving them the real
deal on how everything went down there

1870
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:17,210
and took them to a bunch of different
bars and it didn't seem to me to be as

1871
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:20,240
dangerous as I thought it
was or as dangerous is.

1872
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:22,700
Everybody always publicize it,

1873
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:26,280
but you've got to realize that
it could get way at any moment.

1874
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:27,140
It's,

1875
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:27,630
it's,

1876
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:28,131
it's you're,

1877
00:53:28,131 --> 00:53:32,340
you're living your party and in the
country where shit is just way different,

1878
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:35,730
it's just way different and you can get
lucky and do it a thousand times in a

1879
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:39,480
row or you could get unlucky and you be
there when some drug lord is trying to

1880
00:53:39,481 --> 00:53:40,230
make a point,

1881
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:43,770
like some dudes trying to move product
and someone's trying to block him so he

1882
00:53:43,771 --> 00:53:46,080
decides the light as
fucking nightclub on fire.

1883
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,310
They do shit like that.

1884
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:48,910
Like in Tijuana,

1885
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,050
not until on a and M can coon,

1886
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:54,180
there was a a sell coke on the beach.

1887
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,420
Do they really sell coke on the beach.

1888
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:58,283
We'd go,

1889
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,030
why are we talking about sandals?

1890
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:00,881
Tiawana no,

1891
00:54:00,881 --> 00:54:03,430
they'd come up to you and so
you fucking blow on the beach.

1892
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:05,040
But you know it's been decriminalized.

1893
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:07,470
Everything's been decriminalized and Co,

1894
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:08,670
which is really weird.

1895
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,330
It's awesome.

1896
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,320
Get acid in Mexico.

1897
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,330
I am scan on the last time I was done.

1898
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:12,621
By the way,

1899
00:54:12,621 --> 00:54:13,680
it doesn't mean it's legal.

1900
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:14,421
It's not legal.

1901
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:15,254
It's to be criminal law.

1902
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,113
Yeah.

1903
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:18,090
I think it's still a crime.

1904
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:18,241
Why?

1905
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:20,290
That is why when you
do get caught with it,

1906
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:21,450
you got to pay out the ass.

1907
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:22,411
Cause I wouldn't let you go.

1908
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:23,244
Sure.

1909
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:25,050
It's not illegal my friend.

1910
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:30,080
But maybe if you had a couple
extra thousand on you maybe.

1911
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,240
Is that what they're saying?

1912
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,810
We can work something in my friends.

1913
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:34,660
Yeah.

1914
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,520
They don't want violence.

1915
00:54:35,521 --> 00:54:38,310
They want to keep this business going
and it shouldn't be an understanding that

1916
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:39,810
I just got to give you a little bribery.

1917
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:40,321
Yeah,

1918
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:40,830
that would do.

1919
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,630
I would be down with that
if I thought it was safe.

1920
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,613
I love it.

1921
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,120
I love every aspect of copying and my day,

1922
00:54:46,121 --> 00:54:47,250
I used to go to Ireland.

1923
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,630
I go a four in the morning.

1924
00:54:48,631 --> 00:54:49,800
I like dark buildings.

1925
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:50,820
I like all that shit.

1926
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,110
I ain't going to Mexico.

1927
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:52,860
No,

1928
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:53,250
no,

1929
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:53,401
no.

1930
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:54,000
It's not.

1931
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,211
It's,

1932
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:55,800
I don't need drugs that fucking bad.

1933
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,390
That's a complete different realm.

1934
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,100
That's a complete different realm.

1935
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,030
You could come go down there.

1936
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:00,851
I know people have got,

1937
00:55:00,851 --> 00:55:02,100
other than getting beat the fuck up.

1938
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:02,791
Okay,

1939
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:03,150
ready?

1940
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:03,690
He'll want,

1941
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,770
I've gotten beat the fuck up.

1942
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:06,440
We have a friend from the county.

1943
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:10,370
We have a friend that's gotten beaten
up one time friend who makes mistakes.

1944
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,480
Hook a house down there and I,

1945
00:55:11,481 --> 00:55:11,571
no,

1946
00:55:11,571 --> 00:55:11,731
no.

1947
00:55:11,731 --> 00:55:13,230
He went down and got beat the fuck up.

1948
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:14,040
Don't beat you.

1949
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,050
You want to get beat up until now.

1950
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,170
I have a friend who went there.

1951
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,523
Where's his friend?

1952
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,900
You want to get beat up Asian.

1953
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,610
Is He Asian?

1954
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:20,851
Well,

1955
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:21,890
one of those idiots here.

1956
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,050
They were on that run.

1957
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:23,760
You know,

1958
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,331
I don't want to go to,

1959
00:55:24,331 --> 00:55:25,590
I never went down there for Trump.

1960
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,700
That was a fucking junkie.

1961
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:30,960
I think that it's over a board when a
thousand bad things could happen to you.

1962
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:31,590
Yeah.

1963
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:31,820
Yeah.

1964
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,410
You can fuck out and bad
things could happen to you.

1965
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:38,850
I know Anthony Bordain walked around for
a day surrounded by white people with

1966
00:55:38,851 --> 00:55:39,684
cameras.

1967
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,680
Okay.

1968
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,710
That's a big difference that you wouldn't
be walking around and all we need is

1969
00:55:43,711 --> 00:55:44,820
one Mexican and say hey,

1970
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:46,000
and that,

1971
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
that dude from fractal the field
and all of a sudden they come over,

1972
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:51,331
hey,

1973
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:54,110
follow us through a
potty and we're doomed.

1974
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,223
And then you're kidnapped,

1975
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:55,910
you're kidnapped.

1976
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:56,401
So you know,

1977
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:57,690
I mean you're the one that turned me off.

1978
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,753
A Phoenix,

1979
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:00,850
Phoenix capital,

1980
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,180
the firm.

1981
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,960
What do you think that that comes
into Phoenix from down there.

1982
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:04,440
Yeah,

1983
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,460
and when fee in Phoenix,

1984
00:56:05,461 --> 00:56:06,271
the whole deal with Phoenix,

1985
00:56:06,271 --> 00:56:07,440
since it's all about drugs,

1986
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:08,520
that's what they believe.

1987
00:56:08,521 --> 00:56:10,680
It's about the rival drug dealers.

1988
00:56:10,681 --> 00:56:11,850
People kidnapping each other.

1989
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:15,060
It's more kidnappings in Phoenix
and there isn't any other state,

1990
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:15,630
any other,

1991
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,010
all those border towns,

1992
00:56:17,011 --> 00:56:17,844
Laredo,

1993
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:21,030
they fucking light shit on
fire on the radio constantly.

1994
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,040
I'll pass all you gotta keep
people from Mexico shoot

1995
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,420
at the American side.

1996
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:26,111
Sometimes too,

1997
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,160
which is really crazy.

1998
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:28,270
Like people you know,

1999
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:30,970
report that they're building
a hit by a bullet from Mexico.

2000
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:36,300
I know people have gone down there
to get volumes oxycontin's edition.

2001
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,720
I've never dealt with them,

2002
00:56:37,721 --> 00:56:38,800
but I know they've gone on it,

2003
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,340
but I know millions of people
going on there for the juice.

2004
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:43,643
Yeah.

2005
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:46,870
Let me ask you something about the
juice and Mexico was just Mexican juice.

2006
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,630
Was this still the juice that you get
here and they just sell it over the

2007
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:50,441
counter Mexico?

2008
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:51,710
That's the question I want to know.

2009
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:53,590
I have no idea.

2010
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,890
Like is this the deck of the Robin when
I go to Germany that I get in Germany

2011
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:57,930
that you shoot it,

2012
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:59,280
get from Zadar

2013
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:02,640
makes you very large.

2014
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:04,720
The same deep wall.

2015
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,400
Not very departure health.

2016
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:07,600
That's what I'm worried about.

2017
00:57:07,601 --> 00:57:12,040
If you go to fucking Mexico and buy 60
be balls and they'd be ball or they'd be

2018
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:12,874
ball plus,

2019
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:13,660
I dunno.

2020
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,510
I've never bought in any
pharmaceuticals while in Mexico.

2021
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:17,051
Oh,

2022
00:57:17,051 --> 00:57:17,880
so you've been down there?

2023
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,160
Yeah,

2024
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,941
I've been to Mexico.

2025
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:20,140
I've been to Cancun.

2026
00:57:20,141 --> 00:57:20,861
I've been to,

2027
00:57:20,861 --> 00:57:21,550
uh,

2028
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:22,211
we're outside of bed.

2029
00:57:22,211 --> 00:57:22,961
I've been to Tijuana,

2030
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:24,700
but only very briefly.

2031
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:25,470
No,

2032
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,190
mostly I'm one of the places
when you guys to about,

2033
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:27,870
I heard that,

2034
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:28,900
oh all went to a,

2035
00:57:28,901 --> 00:57:31,000
where she needs say is I went to um,

2036
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:35,000
to see the ruins and [inaudible]
so that was in Mexico too,

2037
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,580
but this was before Mexico

2038
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,390
problems.

2039
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:39,580
Yeah,

2040
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:43,900
back then I did an MTV spring break
thing from Cancun when I was on for fear

2041
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:47,020
factor and they have that on
tape somewhere we should know.

2042
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:47,741
It was just like,

2043
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:48,830
here is a,

2044
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:50,230
this band,

2045
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,340
this band wine shirt.

2046
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,110
I don't wonder what I was wearing.

2047
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,510
I might've went shirtless
cause I'm so small.

2048
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,450
You did a Sandler.

2049
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,290
I don't think I did though.

2050
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:03,280
I don't think I went shirtless.

2051
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,181
If I did,

2052
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:06,220
how dare I were outside.

2053
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:06,970
It was fun.

2054
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:07,481
It was a,

2055
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:08,320
it was a fun,

2056
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:09,940
but I didn't know who any
of the bands where it was.

2057
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,130
Even back then I still was in the dark.

2058
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,960
It's still like new bands.

2059
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:15,580
It's so hard to reach me.

2060
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:16,300
You know,

2061
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,890
like if you're trying
to sell me some shit,

2062
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:18,760
I don't,

2063
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,870
I don't really,

2064
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,220
I don't listen to the radio.

2065
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,000
Did you?

2066
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,470
To listen to Ben Folds?

2067
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:25,540
I want to know if you
would like Ben folds.

2068
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:26,374
I wonder if you'd like,

2069
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,850
I've been living so far apart.

2070
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:32,380
You got to think that every year a new
couple of bands come along and if they're

2071
00:58:32,381 --> 00:58:35,440
good they stick around and there's no
way you can keep in track with all of

2072
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:35,650
them.

2073
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:36,220
I just,

2074
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:36,381
you know,

2075
00:58:36,381 --> 00:58:37,870
someone will look a great song,

2076
00:58:37,871 --> 00:58:38,740
we'll be playing and I'll go,

2077
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:40,000
who is this fucking bans?

2078
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:40,511
Awesome.

2079
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,344
What's his song?

2080
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,030
And then someone will
tell me and I'm like,

2081
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:43,820
never heard of.

2082
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:44,111
I'm like,

2083
00:58:44,111 --> 00:58:44,531
oh my God.

2084
00:58:44,531 --> 00:58:44,761
They're like,

2085
00:58:44,761 --> 00:58:44,950
Dev,

2086
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,090
the number one album in the country.

2087
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:47,980
They've been the number
one band for two years.

2088
00:58:47,981 --> 00:58:48,490
And I'm like,

2089
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:49,210
wow,

2090
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:49,571
I just,

2091
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:50,920
I missed their whole,

2092
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:51,700
I don't know,

2093
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,200
I'm completely out of the loop.

2094
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,710
I named Ben Folds.

2095
00:58:54,711 --> 00:58:55,040
He,

2096
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:55,710
uh,

2097
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:57,650
he used to be in a band
called Penfolds five,

2098
00:58:57,651 --> 00:59:00,250
and then he left the band and his wife,

2099
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,720
he has a CD that he lives in Australia,

2100
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,680
Australia now and he has
kids and a family and uh,

2101
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:08,660
he moved there and now he just,

2102
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,040
he released an album that he
played every single instrument on,

2103
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:14,480
on the CD and then combine them into one.

2104
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,550
And it is some of the best,

2105
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,170
like music music wise.

2106
00:59:18,171 --> 00:59:18,531
It's some of,

2107
00:59:18,531 --> 00:59:19,550
what kind of music is it?

2108
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:21,060
It's just jam,

2109
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:22,310
like very,

2110
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:22,580
you know,

2111
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,100
a lot of pianos it's jamming.

2112
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:25,730
Like you've,

2113
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:26,563
if you've heard,

2114
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:27,560
if I play you a song,

2115
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:27,890
you'd be like,

2116
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,041
Oh,

2117
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:29,000
I've heard this before.

2118
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:29,610
Uh,

2119
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:32,090
he does this uncle like
rock in the suburbs,

2120
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:32,331
you know,

2121
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:33,081
and shit like that.

2122
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:34,760
I have no idea what the
fuck you're talking about,

2123
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,013
but I want it.

2124
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:39,610
I would love to see if you got
got into that or if he hated it.

2125
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,330
Kind of like a grateful dead kind of guy.

2126
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:42,350
I've never hated the debt,

2127
00:59:42,351 --> 00:59:43,340
I just couldn't get into it.

2128
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:43,730
I just,

2129
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:44,211
it just,

2130
00:59:44,211 --> 00:59:45,080
to me it was just,

2131
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:46,790
it was almost like I
was out of tune with it.

2132
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:47,570
I couldn't get,

2133
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:51,280
I know they say and there's
the way that Dennis told me,

2134
00:59:51,281 --> 00:59:51,630
I like,

2135
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:52,180
I like

2136
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,170
working man's dead.

2137
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,040
I like,

2138
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:54,470
uh,

2139
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:56,050
on the mountain fire on the mountain.

2140
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:59,080
A couple of songs I went to see
him with Santana and public enemy.

2141
00:59:59,081 --> 01:00:00,370
I don't fuck around at red rocks,

2142
01:00:00,371 --> 01:00:02,110
but they are a little,

2143
01:00:02,111 --> 01:00:03,550
their whole repertoire is kind of,

2144
01:00:03,551 --> 01:00:04,384
it's so much.

2145
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:07,060
It's the fans that always startled me.

2146
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:07,894
Dog.

2147
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:08,230
Yeah.

2148
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,011
I lived in boulder.

2149
01:00:09,011 --> 01:00:09,880
They pull up with a bus.

2150
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:11,650
They haven't showered in
the fucking six months,

2151
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:12,341
you know,

2152
01:00:12,341 --> 01:00:13,540
that follow with this band,

2153
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:14,201
you're looking at them,

2154
01:00:14,201 --> 01:00:15,940
are they really dirty or they hippies.

2155
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,430
Half of them are trust funders.

2156
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,310
Hi.

2157
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:18,890
You know what I'm saying?

2158
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:19,090
Like,

2159
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:19,660
aw,

2160
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:21,170
fuck cooperations.

2161
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,440
But meanwhile that's
how they're living off.

2162
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,790
That's fucking credit card.

2163
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:26,200
Sneaking showers.

2164
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:27,251
Meanwhile,

2165
01:00:27,251 --> 01:00:28,090
they drive a beamer,

2166
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,350
but they either round the corner.

2167
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:29,970
Oh yeah.

2168
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,120
Boulder's very unique.

2169
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:31,541
You know,

2170
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:34,570
a lot of kids get to boulder in
the anti fucking cooperation,

2171
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:35,920
anti money.

2172
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:36,520
Meanwhile,

2173
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,960
your dad owns fucking Pepsi.

2174
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,490
And you know what I'm saying?

2175
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:40,541
Get it together.

2176
01:00:40,541 --> 01:00:42,830
You've done a little
fuck before I smack you.

2177
01:00:42,831 --> 01:00:45,670
There's a lot of that rebelling
from their successful frog.

2178
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,350
Well fuck him.

2179
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:47,951
You know.

2180
01:00:47,951 --> 01:00:51,010
But meanwhile you got an Audi and you
haven't worked the whole time he head and

2181
01:00:51,011 --> 01:00:52,540
you're buying big bags of wheat,

2182
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:53,540
cut it out.

2183
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,290
There's a weird balance between like your,

2184
01:00:56,291 --> 01:01:00,400
your parents being successful and your
parents being a good parent because of

2185
01:01:00,401 --> 01:01:01,540
the parents really successful.

2186
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:02,710
They probably have to work a lot.

2187
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,350
And if they work all the time constantly,

2188
01:01:05,351 --> 01:01:07,180
they're probably not going
to be around as much.

2189
01:01:07,181 --> 01:01:08,920
They're not going to
be as good of a father.

2190
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,190
And if you're not going to be as good,

2191
01:01:10,191 --> 01:01:12,730
if you can dedicate more time to
work than you are to your kids,

2192
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,490
your kids are probably going
to grow up to fucking resent.

2193
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:16,090
Yeah.

2194
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:16,570
You know?

2195
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:17,500
And that's what happens.

2196
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,500
You get a lot of these trust fund liberal.

2197
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:21,790
He was fair for me.

2198
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:26,110
He never went to another bank ballet
checking back check and balance on your

2199
01:01:26,111 --> 01:01:26,680
account.

2200
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,820
What's in the fucking account?

2201
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:29,351
Did you have a lead?

2202
01:01:29,351 --> 01:01:30,161
I think no,

2203
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:31,030
they shut the fuck up.

2204
01:01:31,031 --> 01:01:31,780
Cock sucker.

2205
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:34,450
I have a friend that grew up with
and every time he had three beers,

2206
01:01:34,451 --> 01:01:38,800
my father never went to another my
football games really look at the nice

2207
01:01:38,801 --> 01:01:39,161
sneakers.

2208
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:42,460
Yet you had a fucking 300
Zx in fucking high school,

2209
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:45,430
your first car and you still
bitching about your fucking parents.

2210
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:46,780
You know they can't do everything,

2211
01:01:46,781 --> 01:01:47,260
Bro.

2212
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,910
You can not be the perfect parent.

2213
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:53,770
You cannot or you could do is fucking
try because somebody is not going to be

2214
01:01:53,771 --> 01:01:55,180
happy with your fucking job.

2215
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:58,630
I would hope that you can teach your
children to not think like that.

2216
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,920
I would hope that you would teach.

2217
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:02,800
You'd be able to teach
your children to not blame.

2218
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:05,050
Your parents are paying for
the last aspect of your life.

2219
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,490
It'd be nice if your parents,

2220
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,410
everybody's parents were
around a little bit more,

2221
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:10,720
but what does that sound?

2222
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,320
You guys hear some sound?

2223
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:15,830
I think it's true.

2224
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:16,440
It is is fine.

2225
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,273
Is that your phone Joey?

2226
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:17,981
I think,

2227
01:02:17,981 --> 01:02:18,850
but I had it off.

2228
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:20,510
Yeah,

2229
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:21,343
it's sweat,

2230
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,290
which was my bitches
is calling me and shit

2231
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:27,223
wasn't a phone call

2232
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:27,500
cause I,

2233
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,430
it was like muffled in the distance and
it was confusing the shit out of me.

2234
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,260
I got a text from Joey,

2235
01:02:32,261 --> 01:02:33,040
Dan's going to die.

2236
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:33,873
I did Tim.

2237
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,833
So he's amazing.

2238
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,433
He has his text.

2239
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,021
No,

2240
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:38,150
no,

2241
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:38,301
no.

2242
01:02:38,301 --> 01:02:39,134
I'll tell you what happened.

2243
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:40,720
That's what you gonna do.

2244
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,110
You to start tweeting like that,

2245
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,880
like a stripper and went,

2246
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,930
went to Ralph's.

2247
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:45,681
Oh Em gee,

2248
01:02:45,681 --> 01:02:46,640
it's packed in here.

2249
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:50,900
When you call this number,

2250
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:51,141
right?

2251
01:02:51,141 --> 01:02:53,120
Let's say you saw me right when I,

2252
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:54,950
sometimes I'm in my two of my pocket.

2253
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:56,360
It's in your pocket.

2254
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:56,780
Right?

2255
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:00,530
So when I go in and there's a thing of
the bottom that slides up and it gives

2256
01:03:00,531 --> 01:03:01,940
you all these excuses.

2257
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:02,980
Oh right,

2258
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:03,620
right.

2259
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:04,760
So when people call you,

2260
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:06,380
so I dunno what I'm pressing right.

2261
01:03:06,381 --> 01:03:07,610
Cause sometimes people
call me back and go,

2262
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,300
dog,

2263
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:08,871
I called you,

2264
01:03:08,871 --> 01:03:09,441
you sent me back,

2265
01:03:09,441 --> 01:03:09,821
you went through,

2266
01:03:09,821 --> 01:03:10,654
what'd you go see?

2267
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:11,693
You're talking about it.

2268
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,561
You just text me.

2269
01:03:12,561 --> 01:03:13,394
You went to cinema

2270
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:15,620
cinema.

2271
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:16,700
I would say about the movies.

2272
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,750
[inaudible]

2273
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:21,960
that's the one I always practice.

2274
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,040
It's fucking set him up like that.

2275
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,630
There's a budget and I'll show it
to you so people keep ticking on.

2276
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:26,851
Joe.

2277
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:27,411
He texts me,

2278
01:03:27,411 --> 01:03:27,981
he's texting me.

2279
01:03:27,981 --> 01:03:32,610
I don't get dads don't get carried away
when you actually sent me a real bad,

2280
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:33,360
you don't want to talk me out.

2281
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:33,921
Fuck it.

2282
01:03:33,921 --> 01:03:37,400
I had to ask the kids daughter to
teach me how to text on my phone.

2283
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,720
He's five.

2284
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:39,771
Really?

2285
01:03:39,771 --> 01:03:40,890
She's fucking fives.

2286
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:41,391
I'm like,

2287
01:03:41,391 --> 01:03:42,230
I don't know how to text him.

2288
01:03:42,231 --> 01:03:43,640
It took the thing from me.

2289
01:03:43,641 --> 01:03:43,881
She goes,

2290
01:03:43,881 --> 01:03:44,990
who do you want a tax?

2291
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,370
She went through the whole thing,

2292
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,440
but she hit applications.

2293
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:49,790
What to the fucking mess.

2294
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:51,050
What kind of phone do you have there,

2295
01:03:51,051 --> 01:03:51,520
Joey?

2296
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:51,941
What is that?

2297
01:03:51,941 --> 01:03:54,800
An android pharmacy for
whatever the fuck it is.

2298
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:55,581
How old is that?

2299
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:55,910
One?

2300
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:56,620
Six months.

2301
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:56,860
Six

2302
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:57,640
months.

2303
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,640
It's crazy how much
phones are progressing,

2304
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,530
how quick they get that galaxy s
three that just came out and um,

2305
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:04,841
my,

2306
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:05,080
uh,

2307
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,300
my friend Matt has and I was fucking
around with it the other day.

2308
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,141
It's amazing,

2309
01:04:08,141 --> 01:04:08,380
man.

2310
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,071
Holy Shit.

2311
01:04:09,071 --> 01:04:09,904
His eyes,

2312
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:10,811
first of all,

2313
01:04:10,811 --> 01:04:11,311
it's fast.

2314
01:04:11,311 --> 01:04:15,520
That shit like it's really smooth
when you back and forth between the,

2315
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,030
the,

2316
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:18,130
the menus and when you open things up,

2317
01:04:18,131 --> 01:04:22,270
the speed of it is really fast and the
pictures are beautiful and the video was

2318
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,104
beautiful.

2319
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:24,130
I didn't screen.

2320
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:26,260
It's fucking huge man.

2321
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:30,370
When you start a watching like videos on
it or watching anything on the Internet

2322
01:04:30,371 --> 01:04:31,204
on it,

2323
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:31,840
it's um,

2324
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,400
it's nice to have flash to it.

2325
01:04:33,401 --> 01:04:34,234
Kind of interesting,

2326
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,103
interesting to say.

2327
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:36,550
Very nice.

2328
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:38,080
They have some bad ass fucking phones now.

2329
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:39,470
Alaskan eat my ass.

2330
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,190
He dies.

2331
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:40,431
I'm,

2332
01:04:40,431 --> 01:04:42,940
the flash is getting
worse and worse and worse.

2333
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,440
It's gotten to the point now where my,

2334
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:44,830
my,

2335
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:47,150
my computer and I found out
this does it on the alien.

2336
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:52,080
Where does it on like every computer that
uses flash where like a lit up a flash

2337
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:55,390
movie in your whole computer just
kind of freezes for like a second.

2338
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:55,541
Yeah.

2339
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:56,020
And then it,

2340
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:59,080
then it kind of catches
back up at the flash.

2341
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,310
If you look at your,

2342
01:05:00,311 --> 01:05:00,760
your,

2343
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,091
your,

2344
01:05:01,091 --> 01:05:01,421
your,

2345
01:05:01,421 --> 01:05:02,020
um,

2346
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,960
your computer Cpu Monitor
and then you do that,

2347
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,120
you'll notice it goes
up to a hundred percent,

2348
01:05:07,121 --> 01:05:08,260
from like 10%.

2349
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,690
How is a dual core,

2350
01:05:10,691 --> 01:05:12,640
whatever triple court fats,

2351
01:05:12,641 --> 01:05:14,680
top of the line computer like,

2352
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:16,180
like that.

2353
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,400
It can't handle a fucking flash.

2354
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:18,790
I don't,

2355
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:19,031
yeah,

2356
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:19,864
I don't know enough.

2357
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:23,200
Last computer die eat aids.

2358
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,131
I don't think you're going to eat it.

2359
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:24,970
It's so fun.

2360
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:27,610
I think if someone can give you a
bowl aids and you could be fine.

2361
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:31,210
So let's put flash on your
fucking phone goes in that way.

2362
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:34,990
I'll bowl of a scoop of a bull aids.

2363
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:35,651
What do you think?

2364
01:05:35,651 --> 01:05:36,484
What color would it be?

2365
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,210
I'd say yellow.

2366
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:38,043
So why don't we,

2367
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,580
why don't we enjoy like
let flash onto our phone.

2368
01:05:42,581 --> 01:05:42,881
That does,

2369
01:05:42,881 --> 01:05:43,900
that seems like a good idea.

2370
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:47,050
Let's just change the
subject like everybody else.

2371
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:48,281
Go with the flow.

2372
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:50,740
You fuck it's flash thing.

2373
01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:51,670
He's obsessed with them.

2374
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:52,563
But what's flash?

2375
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:54,890
It's just a program
that you run on the um,

2376
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:58,300
on a android phones that you
can't run on apple iPhones.

2377
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:01,390
It's essentially a
animation web animation.

2378
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:02,260
It looks like little videos.

2379
01:06:02,261 --> 01:06:03,430
Youtube used to use it,

2380
01:06:03,431 --> 01:06:08,431
but a lot of what they use now is a html
five and they also have it directly for

2381
01:06:08,471 --> 01:06:09,100
the iPhone.

2382
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:09,790
So you just,

2383
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:13,840
anytime you click on a youtube video
you have like a youtube application that

2384
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:14,674
opens up,

2385
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:17,170
recognizes most new videos
like pretty quickly.

2386
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:17,711
It's like,

2387
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:18,130
Hey,

2388
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:22,330
my phone also has a floppy disk
and the iPhone doesn't so well.

2389
01:06:22,331 --> 01:06:22,601
Yeah,

2390
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:23,500
I definitely,

2391
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,820
I definitely think that it works
really seamlessly on the iPhone.

2392
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:28,500
The uh,

2393
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,490
like when I got a youtube
videos and shit like that,

2394
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,000
he works pretty fucking smooth
and it would have to be,

2395
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:37,450
I would have to be really impressed
with how well it worked on the droid to

2396
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,310
think about switching
over just because of that.

2397
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,990
I tell you that the hottest thing,

2398
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:42,190
hottest thing.

2399
01:06:42,191 --> 01:06:43,210
And Mac Technology,

2400
01:06:43,211 --> 01:06:43,750
I'm just kidding.

2401
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,680
The hottest thing right now,

2402
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:45,550
I think it's cool

2403
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:49,820
is the new operating system

2404
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:56,390
that the new operating system,

2405
01:06:56,391 --> 01:06:59,900
new Mac has a screen sharing on it.

2406
01:06:59,901 --> 01:07:00,890
So you just like,

2407
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:04,730
you can just hit this button
and in any TV that has apple TV,

2408
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:07,640
it's sends your monitor to the TV now.

2409
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:09,920
So like if you want to work on it,

2410
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:13,040
70 inch resolution screen,

2411
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:14,930
you just on your laptop or whatever,

2412
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,360
you just hit this button and
it will flip it to your TV.

2413
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:18,300
So now,

2414
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:22,700
so I'm sitting there watching youtube or
doing websites and love watching videos

2415
01:07:22,701 --> 01:07:23,181
on my,

2416
01:07:23,181 --> 01:07:26,140
on my big TV brands going to break our,

2417
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:30,170
all of our brain's gonna break do
the integration and the technological

2418
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:30,681
integration.

2419
01:07:30,681 --> 01:07:31,880
It's just getting too crazy.

2420
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:33,380
It's getting nuttier and nuttier

2421
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:34,500
Joe Rogan,

2422
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,333
I gotta give you something.

2423
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:36,241
I forgot.

2424
01:07:36,241 --> 01:07:37,230
I've got a video for you.

2425
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,213
What is it?

2426
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:39,230
Oh,

2427
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:40,063

2428
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:43,020

2430
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:48,970
Yeah.

2431
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:52,620
Oh they fucking go out in that,

2432
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,990
in that arena in Palm Bay.

2433
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,310
Put on hold real quick.

2434
01:07:57,390 --> 01:07:58,230
Tell me what it is again.

2435
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:00,170

2436
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:02,410

They'll say live is pump pay and click

2438
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,333
two minutes.

2439
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,920
Pink Floyd Echo's part one.

2440
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:11,520
Yes.

2441
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,370
Live at Pompei.

2442
01:08:12,371 --> 01:08:14,070
It's got to see it live

2443
01:08:14,071 --> 01:08:14,540
Yeah.

2444
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:14,700
No.

2445
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,760
Who the fuck went to pump?

2446
01:08:15,761 --> 01:08:15,980
Pay?

2447
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,340
Anybody even know what Monday is live
would pump out here in this part.

2448
01:08:19,341 --> 01:08:20,370
One is in Pompano.

2449
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:23,240
And how far do I go in?

2450
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:25,280
Go in like two minutes into the video.

2451
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:26,240
What you want to do it.

2452
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:27,483
This is this little,

2453
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:28,190
uh,

2454
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:31,400
it also has a lock and go to you
just stream and shut this off.

2455
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:32,234
Hold on a second.

2456
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:35,250
It's got what I got to go to
Ustream is shut off the volume.

2457
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:39,440
Got a CD and I seen this movie as a kid
on acid and the other night somebody

2458
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:43,270
sent it to me and I went to youtube and
I had to watch it three times in a row.

2459
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,690
Where do I tune into it?

2460
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,180
Go two minutes into like,

2461
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:49,810
well it's let it set and then
just watch these motherfuckers.

2462
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:50,653
I mean this is,

2463
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,760
it's a some Greek statues.

2464
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:56,420
Oh yeah.

2465
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:57,670
This is their outlet though.

2466
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,130
If you had a fucking time machine,

2467
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:01,993
this is really cool.

2468
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:02,900
If you had a time machine,

2469
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:05,300
what culture would you go
back and watch the Greeks.

2470
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:06,163
The Greeks.

2471
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:07,783
Why is that?

2472
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,290
How fucking cool was it?

2473
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:10,410
They had that coliseum.

2474
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,181
Where Bruce Leaf.

2475
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:11,660
What?

2476
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:13,340
Just not solely fucking things.

2477
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,050
Rome brother,

2478
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:15,861
whatever.

2479
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:16,371
Same thing.

2480
01:09:16,371 --> 01:09:16,911
The Romans,

2481
01:09:16,911 --> 01:09:17,601
the Corinthians.

2482
01:09:17,601 --> 01:09:18,231
I'm confused.

2483
01:09:18,231 --> 01:09:19,064
Dog.

2484
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:20,480
Who's the Corinthians there?

2485
01:09:20,481 --> 01:09:21,314
It'll wash.

2486
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:22,220
Um,

2487
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,031
that's what they became.

2488
01:09:23,031 --> 01:09:24,410
The Romans became the Italians.

2489
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:27,680
The Corinthians Corinthians become,

2490
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:28,010
yeah,

2491
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:28,940
white people wash.

2492
01:09:28,941 --> 01:09:29,774
Is it French?

2493
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:30,351
No,

2494
01:09:30,351 --> 01:09:31,850
they're the ones Jesus talked to first.

2495
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:33,380
But Jesus told the Corinthians.

2496
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:34,700
Yeah,

2497
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:35,990
I thought they were fucking white people.

2498
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,010
I don't like Anglos.

2499
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:38,183
I don't know.

2500
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:38,870
I've,

2501
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:43,010
I've rejected all my teachings of
my youth and they have so here,

2502
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:43,873
but um,

2503
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,153
he's uh,

2504
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:46,191
yeah,

2505
01:09:46,191 --> 01:09:46,641
this is,

2506
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:47,000
uh,

2507
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,320
this is a weird thing.

2508
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,580
Why are they in Pompei?

2509
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:50,770
They're doing a live out,

2510
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:51,140
but just,

2511
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,100
just give it a minute.

2512
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:53,630
Listen to this fucking music though.

2513
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,810
Like on a steaming island.

2514
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:57,681
Oh God.

2515
01:09:57,681 --> 01:09:58,520
It's amazing.

2516
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:01,280
Dog shares of a Greek gods.

2517
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:03,590
I would pick ancient Egypt.

2518
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,930
I would pick Egypt over Greece,

2519
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,120
but I think Bruce would
be pretty dope too.

2520
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:12,230
But I would like to in the fucking right
when the pyramids were being built,

2521
01:10:12,231 --> 01:10:16,640
I would love to have gone to see what
the fuck they were living like they keep

2522
01:10:16,641 --> 01:10:21,140
finding shit that keeps pushing back
the date of civilization later and later

2523
01:10:21,141 --> 01:10:21,974
and later.

2524
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:27,610
He found tools recently and proof that
civilization is at least 20,000 years

2525
01:10:29,031 --> 01:10:30,260
older than they thought it was.

2526
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:32,383
That's a big jump.

2527
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:33,590
20,000 years.

2528
01:10:33,591 --> 01:10:34,730
A big goddamn jump

2529
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:38,630
and there's still fine
and stuff all the time.

2530
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:41,690
Who knows how much stuff
is still buried in Turkey.

2531
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:46,240
I know Turkey is where they found
Troy Turkey's where they found gold.

2532
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:50,030
Beckley tamping turkeys when
they found that statute.

2533
01:10:50,031 --> 01:10:50,864
When the exorcist.

2534
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:51,600
Yeah.

2535
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,680
More the two bars fight.

2536
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:53,730
Not In the fuck a wilderness.

2537
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,070
Well you watch that again.

2538
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,070
I always talk about it because
it's such a well made movie.

2539
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:58,820
Oh yeah.

2540
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:00,530
When he's in Arabia and Africa.

2541
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:01,401
Africa.

2542
01:11:01,401 --> 01:11:02,540
That's where the devil lives.

2543
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:04,010
Devil lives in Africa.

2544
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:06,320
I know cause bro,

2545
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:07,520
everybody lives in Africa.

2546
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:10,590
All that shit's got in Africa Bro.

2547
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:12,050
It'll all,

2548
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,650
this whole party started in Africa.

2549
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,910
If you look back,

2550
01:11:14,911 --> 01:11:15,300
look at it.

2551
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,800
It off in Africa.

2552
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:18,460
When you Brian,

2553
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:19,021
where's your dog?

2554
01:11:19,021 --> 01:11:19,854
Man,

2555
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,330
you shut that door so she cannot catch it.

2556
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:24,930
Okay.

2557
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:28,080
I just want to make sure she doesn't
eat catch it because that's rude.

2558
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:29,873
It's grass.

2559
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:32,260
Another thing they found recently,

2560
01:11:32,261 --> 01:11:32,590
man,

2561
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:33,730
I wanted to talk about this.

2562
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:38,880
They found evidence that a mass amount
of people were killed in London in the 15

2563
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:41,410
hundreds by a volcano.

2564
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:45,740
London volcano does.

2565
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:47,231
I was,

2566
01:11:47,231 --> 01:11:48,064
uh,

2567
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:48,611
in the middle.

2568
01:11:48,611 --> 01:11:52,570
I was running out the door
when I read this and um,

2569
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:54,220
I didn't,

2570
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:57,520
didn't get a chance to really
look at it like deep in there,

2571
01:11:57,521 --> 01:12:00,460
but this is apparently it's
a recent discovery and what,

2572
01:12:00,461 --> 01:12:01,270
what they're,

2573
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:04,120
what they've decided is that,

2574
01:12:04,121 --> 01:12:04,954
um,

2575
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:10,350
they found thousands of skeletons and
mass graves in London's east end and they

2576
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:14,350
believe that many were victims of
a 13th century volcanic eruption.

2577
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,110
Hmm.

2578
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:16,943
I'm not nuts.

2579
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:17,950
That's fucking crazy.

2580
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:19,293
Yeah.

2581
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:20,201
They found,

2582
01:12:20,201 --> 01:12:21,034
um,

2583
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,181
wow.

2584
01:12:22,181 --> 01:12:22,961
This is amazing,

2585
01:12:22,961 --> 01:12:23,794
man.

2586
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:26,740
The skeletons were uncovered next to a s.

2587
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:27,280
Wow.

2588
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,061
This is a weird word.

2589
01:12:28,061 --> 01:12:29,260
Spit of fields.

2590
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:30,123
Bill fields.

2591
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,780
It's a bit of fields market.

2592
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,353
When the news,

2593
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:34,721
new,

2594
01:12:34,721 --> 01:12:35,554
spittle,

2595
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:36,091
spittle,

2596
01:12:36,091 --> 01:12:36,940
square one.

2597
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:39,790
What kind of name is
that new spittle square,

2598
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:41,710
um,

2599
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:43,180
development we started 20 years ago.

2600
01:12:43,181 --> 01:12:43,840
So I guess they,

2601
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,880
they started digging and
they found that shit.

2602
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,000
And now a 10 year ecological
investigation by the Museum of London has

2603
01:12:50,001 --> 01:12:53,110
discovered that the likely
cause to be volcano,

2604
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:55,390
which led to world temperatures,

2605
01:12:55,391 --> 01:12:57,730
cooling down and crops failing,

2606
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:00,130
resulting in a mass starvation.

2607
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,360
Holy Shit.

2608
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:08,040
10,500 skeletons dating from the 12th to
the 16th century were uncovered by the

2609
01:13:08,321 --> 01:13:09,041
archeologists,

2610
01:13:09,041 --> 01:13:14,041
including mass burial pits
that had scientists baffled
because the radio carbon

2611
01:13:14,111 --> 01:13:16,990
dating didn't match known
events in medieval England,

2612
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:19,000
like the black death or the great famine.

2613
01:13:19,001 --> 01:13:19,840
That's incredible.

2614
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:25,650
This is 1258 there was a
colossal volcano in 1258 wow.

2615
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,980
This is amazing,

2616
01:13:29,981 --> 01:13:30,814
man.

2617
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:33,940
So this is a new discovery that such a,

2618
01:13:33,941 --> 01:13:35,410
a massive global,

2619
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,160
national,

2620
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:41,160
natural disaster has been identified
in a small area of east London.

2621
01:13:42,190 --> 01:13:43,240
That's incredible,

2622
01:13:43,241 --> 01:13:44,074
man.

2623
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,300
That is amazing shit.

2624
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:48,461
Yeah.

2625
01:13:48,461 --> 01:13:49,420
We don't know too much.

2626
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:50,500
You know,

2627
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:50,771
when they,

2628
01:13:50,771 --> 01:13:52,300
when they really talk about history,

2629
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:53,950
like what we really know about the past,

2630
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:54,671
man,

2631
01:13:54,671 --> 01:13:55,720
we don't really know that much.

2632
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:56,500
We don't know.

2633
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,850
We just make a fucking assumption.

2634
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:58,811
We dig,

2635
01:13:58,811 --> 01:13:59,550
we dig,

2636
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:01,630
and every other week we come up
with a new fucking assumption.

2637
01:14:01,631 --> 01:14:02,920
It's amazing how much we're fine,

2638
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:05,170
but that fucking take
either that looks kinky,

2639
01:14:05,171 --> 01:14:06,004
come eat too.

2640
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:07,063
I don't think that's fair.

2641
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:09,110
And who gives a fuck?

2642
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:10,550
You got to go to bars now.

2643
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:12,520
Now $14 billion.

2644
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,061
A lot of shit.

2645
01:14:13,061 --> 01:14:14,710
We got going on this fucking country.

2646
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:15,700
Mars for what?

2647
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:16,960
Who gives a fuck about Mars?

2648
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:17,921
I'm sitting there going,

2649
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:19,390
this is who Gazeena this fucking the tape.

2650
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:20,740
They made this in Burbank.

2651
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:22,300
Well this is what I think.

2652
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:22,961
I think first of all,

2653
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:23,530
yeah,

2654
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:25,390
they did go and it's awesome.

2655
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:30,420
And when you spend money on scientific
innovation for space travel,

2656
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:35,950
you're dealing with the cream of the
crop of people that are trying to figure

2657
01:14:35,951 --> 01:14:40,951
out how to manipulate space and matter
and and transport things and how to,

2658
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:42,100
you know,

2659
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,170
I mean you're dealing with the most,

2660
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:45,200
the,

2661
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:50,200
the most knowledgeable scientists on
earth that has right to be strived.

2662
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:52,660
And Suzanne.

2663
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,091
Joey,

2664
01:14:53,091 --> 01:14:53,411
come on.

2665
01:14:53,411 --> 01:14:53,651
I mean,

2666
01:14:53,651 --> 01:14:54,484
I'm serious.

2667
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,480
I'm saying silly.

2668
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:57,050
This is what every,

2669
01:14:57,051 --> 01:15:00,940
let me tell you that everything that
they do when they got to go to fucking

2670
01:15:00,941 --> 01:15:01,181
place,

2671
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:02,680
I ex what it has to do.

2672
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:04,630
We got diseases.

2673
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:08,910
We've got fat kids running
around and [inaudible] march.

2674
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,020
Definitely we should pay
attention to the IRC.

2675
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,900
We should go and explore the universe
all burn me a little by little.

2676
01:15:16,901 --> 01:15:17,810
We'll fucking dying.

2677
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:18,580
He had dog.

2678
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,020
This country is fucking dying.

2679
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:21,220
We got time to,

2680
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:22,840
I don't give a fuck what goes on at Mars.

2681
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:26,890
I don't give a fuck what goes on in
Oakland and loved it either 1529 I'm from

2682
01:15:26,891 --> 01:15:28,000
the Church of what's happening now,

2683
01:15:28,001 --> 01:15:28,834
mother fucker.

2684
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:29,980
If you care about that shit,

2685
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:32,300
you got too much fucking
time on your hands guy.

2686
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:34,123
What's that got to do?

2687
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:34,811
We've got kids.

2688
01:15:34,811 --> 01:15:35,644
We've got houses.

2689
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:36,820
Shut the fuck down.

2690
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:38,960
You've got billions of
dollars to go to model.

2691
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:39,701
Give a fuck about,

2692
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:40,120
I know this.

2693
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,920
Why don't you get this
excited about the wars?

2694
01:15:41,921 --> 01:15:43,420
Because that costs a thousand times.

2695
01:15:43,421 --> 01:15:46,800
I don't get excited about mother shit
because it doesn't have what the fuck that

2696
01:15:46,801 --> 01:15:50,440
that they'd been fighting for 10 years
and I'm still paying $5 for a fucking gas

2697
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:51,274
guy.

2698
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:54,400
The money we're spending
on the war is a billion,

2699
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:54,490
billion,

2700
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:57,460
billions and billions of dollars every
fucking year and how are we going to

2701
01:15:57,461 --> 01:15:59,260
spend more fucking money on going to Mars?

2702
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:01,390
It's bad luck was going to Afghanistan.

2703
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:03,340
That Mars thing is a positive thing.

2704
01:16:03,341 --> 01:16:04,174
The Mars thing,

2705
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:06,240
they're going to get
innovation out of this project.

2706
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:07,590
I need them in,

2707
01:16:07,591 --> 01:16:08,710
in everything else.

2708
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,360
It's going to eventually lead to,

2709
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:10,600
I mean,

2710
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,970
who knows what kind of space travel
eventually we're going to have,

2711
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:15,290
you're never going to go and
I'm never going to go fuck.

2712
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:16,420
It got nothing to do with us.

2713
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:17,390
That's what the problem was.

2714
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:17,980
I says,

2715
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:20,230
we can't buy shit that got
nothing to do with that.

2716
01:16:20,231 --> 01:16:22,540
This is why I care about it
because it's cool as fuck.

2717
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,840
When that thing lands on Mars and starts
taking pictures and sending it through

2718
01:16:25,841 --> 01:16:26,500
the sky.

2719
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:29,890
And I see a room full of people who've
worked on nothing but this for years.

2720
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:32,590
It's fucking awesome.

2721
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,230
And I pick up an envelope at the thing.

2722
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:36,850
All right,

2723
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:40,000
you're going to jump up and down to
somebody landed in market like a bunch of

2724
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:43,660
fucking dicks that they were white with
blue shirts on and shit jumping up.

2725
01:16:43,661 --> 01:16:46,000
And that's what NASA is.

2726
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:48,520
Matthew understanding of the
detail work put together.

2727
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,140
And I appreciate travel.

2728
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:50,471
You know,

2729
01:16:50,471 --> 01:16:53,680
10 years ago we hung out for years and
you would talk about the moon landing was

2730
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:54,130
fake.

2731
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:56,500
Now all of a sudden you're
happy about fucking Mars guy.

2732
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:57,513
Come on,

2733
01:16:57,670 --> 01:16:58,690
give me a fucking break.

2734
01:16:58,691 --> 01:17:00,100
What are they all connected?

2735
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,310
Cars.

2736
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,143
Canal

2737
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:05,440
that goes out of her day.

2738
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:07,030
It's waste a thought.

2739
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,710
We got bigger things to fry.

2740
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:10,220
Gas is $5

2741
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:10,820
a day.

2742
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:12,350
We got this note routing guide.

2743
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,160
Who's a fucking comic con uh,

2744
01:17:14,161 --> 01:17:18,390
water fuck from Idaho or Utah
or the fuck is from again.

2745
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:20,120
So Baba that's going on.

2746
01:17:20,121 --> 01:17:20,631
Good days,

2747
01:17:20,631 --> 01:17:21,260
his wife,

2748
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:22,190
cause she's making fat.

2749
01:17:22,191 --> 01:17:23,360
Kids get fucking skinny.

2750
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:24,200
That's it.

2751
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:24,441
I mean,

2752
01:17:24,441 --> 01:17:25,190
what the fuck?

2753
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:26,090
What the fuck?

2754
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:27,410
We don't even have a prison.

2755
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,270
We know we don't have somebody in a boat
for the next four years and we'll worry

2756
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:31,130
about fucking Mars.

2757
01:17:31,131 --> 01:17:35,420
Joe Rogan rarely about fucking what
happened in England in 1529 we need to

2758
01:17:35,421 --> 01:17:37,340
fucking know what's going to
happen at the next three years.

2759
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:38,001
You know what,

2760
01:17:38,001 --> 01:17:38,510
Doug,

2761
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:39,050
you're right.

2762
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:42,550
I'm about to have a baby and I'm fucking
scared because what is he going to have

2763
01:17:42,551 --> 01:17:43,251
in 40 years?

2764
01:17:43,251 --> 01:17:43,880
What are we going to have?

2765
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,800
We're going to be getting
fucked in the ass by Arabs,

2766
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,060
but bunch of white people

2767
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:51,440
go see if the Arabs are
jumping up and down,

2768
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:52,490
they're fucking gone.

2769
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:53,540
Wait Til we get those wipe.

2770
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:55,730
If they get excited like
that about landing in Mars,

2771
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,460
wait til they sniffed this arrow.

2772
01:17:57,461 --> 01:18:00,290
Bass Hall has their sucking
my Dick Cause my learn.

2773
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:03,770
How does my daughter have to learn
Spanish or does she have to learn fucking

2774
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,570
Arab in the next 20 fucking years?

2775
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,860
That's what I'm worried about,

2776
01:18:06,861 --> 01:18:07,400
dog.

2777
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,510
Does my kid have to go to school with
80 fucking foreigners or does she know

2778
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:11,410
that's what I worry about.

2779
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:12,710
So fuck march bro.

2780
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:16,030
I don't want to hear about fucking Mars
and a bunch of fucking waspy fucking

2781
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:18,740
glasses jumping up and down
cause we landed on Mars.

2782
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,890
There's a of fucking mortgage
is upside down this country.

2783
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:22,940
Fucking painful.

2784
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:23,773
The students.

2785
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:25,490
Are you going to stop doing stand up?

2786
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:26,660
No,

2787
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:27,540
I'm not going to stop doing.

2788
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:30,020
So why would they stop
pulling with rover on Mars,

2789
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:30,790
but what's mines?

2790
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:31,850
That's when they join.

2791
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:33,170
That's what they do.

2792
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,870
That's what they know that I say eggs.

2793
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:40,890
They're already on their art is creating
something that can fly through fucking

2794
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:43,130
space for a year.

2795
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,200
That's great land fucking time.

2796
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,020
And I think they pay me.

2797
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:51,050
These mother fuckers are using
my money to go to fucking Mars.

2798
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,830
They take a half of your fucking check
but taking half of my fucking check to go

2799
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:55,311
to Mars.

2800
01:18:55,311 --> 01:18:55,851
Mother Fucker,

2801
01:18:55,851 --> 01:18:57,200
you get angry when you,

2802
01:18:57,230 --> 01:18:58,820
they take that money and they go to war.

2803
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,260
I don't even think about it.

2804
01:19:00,261 --> 01:19:02,720
The war is something that
more of that war we need.

2805
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:03,320
War,

2806
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:03,651
war,

2807
01:19:03,651 --> 01:19:04,040
fight.

2808
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:04,281
What?

2809
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:07,430
How much money do we make
by going tomorrow when we
put a put a Burger King on

2810
01:19:07,431 --> 01:19:07,700
mine,

2811
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:08,480
we think we need more.

2812
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,490
What are we going to put out
cards we're going to make?

2813
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,750
How are we going to pick up an envelope?

2814
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:12,740
It's very in a Jew.

2815
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:15,020
They're in a fucking
Juliet's happy right now,

2816
01:19:15,021 --> 01:19:15,621
but what's going on?

2817
01:19:15,621 --> 01:19:19,520
It's Comcast is sponsored by ear doctors
all across America and the conspiracy

2818
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:25,240
copters and hired Joey to make
people blow their ear drums out.

2819
01:19:25,671 --> 01:19:26,504
That pissed

2820
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:30,190
so many things going on.

2821
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,540
This is a closing fucking people.

2822
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:36,480
He's a clone human pastors.

2823
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:39,170
We got to go to fucking
what bars to give a fuck.

2824
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:39,591
Listen,

2825
01:19:39,591 --> 01:19:40,101
I ain't go Joey.

2826
01:19:40,101 --> 01:19:40,600
I support.

2827
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,060
I support your Hubris on us.

2828
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:42,650
None of them,

2829
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:43,251
and listen bro,

2830
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:43,940
I don't mind.

2831
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:45,190
We've got to send pre Puerto Rican is,

2832
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,310
I would have to establish a ride.

2833
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:47,560
That's what needs to be done.

2834
01:19:47,561 --> 01:19:50,890
I'm going to blow up a fucking building
or three black guys establish a wrap.

2835
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:51,733
That's what needs to be done.

2836
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,380
Wore his money to fucking bottom line.

2837
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:59,390
The square root of war guy is Didas and
we've all known that divis that's the

2838
01:19:59,691 --> 01:20:00,650
square root of money.

2839
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:04,520
I don't see any divas and that's going
to Mars except taking a bunch of rich

2840
01:20:04,521 --> 01:20:06,050
people and charge them
to take them to Mars.

2841
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,000
There's a quill and they explain you got

2842
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:12,270
to every fucking drone is flying
in Pakistan and taken out al Qaeda.

2843
01:20:12,271 --> 01:20:17,271
If you believe in that shit I made by
scientists and that's if you want to argue

2844
01:20:18,961 --> 01:20:20,430
about keeping people safe,

2845
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:21,840
the best way to keep people safe.

2846
01:20:21,841 --> 01:20:21,961
Look,

2847
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:22,400
I'm not a,

2848
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:26,790
I'm not saying I advocate drones because
fuck load of civilians have died from

2849
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:27,630
the use of drone attack,

2850
01:20:27,631 --> 01:20:30,750
but they eventually get that shit
wire to the point where they can kill

2851
01:20:30,751 --> 01:20:31,890
everybody they want to kill.

2852
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,910
That's where it's the scientists that
are involved in making that shit or the

2853
01:20:35,911 --> 01:20:39,120
saint scientists that are
involved in making all sorts of,

2854
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:43,170
I love it and spacecrafts and
Aircrafts and love technology,

2855
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:43,531
man,

2856
01:20:43,531 --> 01:20:44,341
you want to kill somebody?

2857
01:20:44,341 --> 01:20:44,700
You make up.

2858
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,720
I want to see the bullet.

2859
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:47,110
I don't need a gun for it.

2860
01:20:47,111 --> 01:20:49,740
I just got to go like this and
a hitching your head blows up.

2861
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,180
I appreciate the scientist,

2862
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:52,320
but not right now.

2863
01:20:52,321 --> 01:20:55,170
Billions of dollars to
go to phone only Joey.

2864
01:20:55,171 --> 01:20:58,680
That is a tiny fraction of
what our military budget.

2865
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,920
It's a tiny tach for freedom.

2866
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,720
What does Mars has to do with it?

2867
01:21:03,930 --> 01:21:05,880
It's a Martian gonna come back to Vegas.

2868
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:07,170
That's a crazy thing to say.

2869
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:11,010
The military is fighting for our freedom.

2870
01:21:11,011 --> 01:21:13,540
Is that why we're in countries that
have absolutely nothing to do with us.

2871
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:15,090
That's why and we invited them to,

2872
01:21:15,091 --> 01:21:15,451
come on,

2873
01:21:15,451 --> 01:21:15,900
man,

2874
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:16,733
that's crazy.

2875
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:18,140
That fucking flag brother.

2876
01:21:18,850 --> 01:21:19,683
What bad?

2877
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:20,660
We got to kill some money.

2878
01:21:20,661 --> 01:21:23,480
You got to break a fucking few
homage to fucking make an album.

2879
01:21:23,481 --> 01:21:26,430
You got to break some eggs to make a
few of them that whatever they're doing,

2880
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,260
it's a lot better than fucking,

2881
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:29,340
they're selling drugs.

2882
01:21:29,341 --> 01:21:30,450
The CIA sells coke.

2883
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:31,590
At least they make him money,

2884
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:32,453
Mars and got,

2885
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:33,721
here's the big thing,

2886
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:34,011
Joe,

2887
01:21:34,011 --> 01:21:35,010
is that every time,

2888
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,400
every time they send
something to like Mars or the,

2889
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:38,490
or do these missions,

2890
01:21:38,491 --> 01:21:43,140
they are also doing hundreds of
experiments and these experiments are

2891
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:45,330
experiencing that we can't do,

2892
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:46,303
you know,

2893
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:51,720
down on earth where do in a lot of these
experiments lead to other things that

2894
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:52,711
do help us out,

2895
01:21:52,711 --> 01:21:55,340
like cures for cancer
and fucking time travel.

2896
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:55,411
Well,

2897
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:56,244
let's get the cure.

2898
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:56,641
Listen,

2899
01:21:56,641 --> 01:21:57,660
just to be a dollar.

2900
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:58,381
It's going to be,

2901
01:21:58,381 --> 01:21:59,760
it's going to come a point in time.

2902
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:04,470
If we follow the path that we're on
right now where we might not be living on

2903
01:22:04,471 --> 01:22:05,670
this fucking planet anymore,

2904
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:07,880
we're human beings might
pollute this motherfucker.

2905
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:10,380
The point where we're going to want to
escape and what they're gonna do is I'm

2906
01:22:10,381 --> 01:22:11,700
going to send shit to Mars,

2907
01:22:11,701 --> 01:22:12,570
to terraform,

2908
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:14,640
just like they did in the movie aliens,

2909
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:17,880
and they're going to put a fucking fake
atmosphere on Mars and that's going to

2910
01:22:17,881 --> 01:22:22,380
bear a little escape colony graduate
question you got to do with us.

2911
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:23,560
You'll be dead.

2912
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,250
Be Dead.

2913
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:24,820
I don't care.

2914
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:25,301
It'll be fun.

2915
01:22:25,301 --> 01:22:25,531
I don't,

2916
01:22:25,531 --> 01:22:26,370
you know what else to do it.

2917
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:28,980
I'm alive right now and when
something lands on Mars,

2918
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:29,940
I get geeked out.

2919
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:32,240
I want to see that shit out.

2920
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,090
Looking at the photos,

2921
01:22:33,091 --> 01:22:33,670
I'm like that,

2922
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:34,740
that land.

2923
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,360
Has it ever been seen before?

2924
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:36,961
Is that like,

2925
01:22:36,961 --> 01:22:38,520
is there have been people
that have walked on?

2926
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:39,810
It looks like fucking Arizona.

2927
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:39,991
Well,

2928
01:22:39,991 --> 01:22:40,460
you know,

2929
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:41,340
it doesn't really Arizona,

2930
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:42,570
but you know there is,

2931
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:47,670
there's a real theory that's a fascinating
theory that Mars used to inhabit life

2932
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:48,870
than it used to have an atmosphere,

2933
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:52,830
but it was hit by an asteroid and that's
one of the reasons why they want to

2934
01:22:52,831 --> 01:22:54,690
keep sending things there and get to task.

2935
01:22:54,691 --> 01:22:57,990
Because if it was a planet
that supported life like ours,

2936
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,670
but then it was hit by an asteroid,

2937
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,050
we realize that we've,

2938
01:23:01,051 --> 01:23:03,780
we've had mass extinctions on this planet,

2939
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:06,340
at least two of them
that caused by asteroids,

2940
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:07,001
you know,

2941
01:23:07,001 --> 01:23:09,450
hundreds of millions of years ago
and then 65 million years ago.

2942
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:12,100
They know that there's been some
just doozies that have landed,

2943
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:15,190
but it's possible that one could
land that just kills the whole thing.

2944
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,091
That's a wrap.

2945
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:16,781
Let me ask you something,

2946
01:23:16,781 --> 01:23:17,614
Bro.

2947
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,113
You up.

2948
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:19,340
Okay.

2949
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:20,680
Can you sell an asteroid?

2950
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:22,620
Can You bring an asteroid
to a check cashing?

2951
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:24,910
Send a dog to get my fucking money.

2952
01:23:24,911 --> 01:23:26,950
Fucking ass to really going
to vote for this year.

2953
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:27,551
I mean,

2954
01:23:27,551 --> 01:23:29,680
I don't want to write in Doug.

2955
01:23:29,690 --> 01:23:30,400
Stan hope.

2956
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,260
That's what I was thinking,

2957
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:32,110
right it Doug Stanhope

2958
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:35,440
and you see what's going
on in this country.

2959
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,140
We could get a lot of
people that read it and go,

2960
01:23:37,141 --> 01:23:38,170
what's going on in this country?

2961
01:23:38,171 --> 01:23:39,004
Joe Rogan,

2962
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:41,750
intelligent guy.

2963
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:45,190
I'm a fucking Momo and I know
that those both of them a bumps.

2964
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:46,590
You're an intelligent guy.

2965
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:50,520
You just looking at my face and told me
you're not confident about anybody who's

2966
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:51,281
running for president.

2967
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:52,030
This country,

2968
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:55,510
you and another fucking
million people feel that way.

2969
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:55,721
Well,

2970
01:23:55,721 --> 01:23:56,700
this is the real problem.

2971
01:23:56,701 --> 01:23:57,430
We feel that way.

2972
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:58,330
They're going to have to,

2973
01:23:58,331 --> 01:24:00,640
they're going to have to restructure
this whole fucking thing.

2974
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:01,840
The way this thing works.

2975
01:24:01,841 --> 01:24:02,350
Now,

2976
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:04,470
the first of all there was
getting people to offices,

2977
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:05,800
absolute horse shit.

2978
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:08,800
This whole electoral college that
might've worked when there was a hundred

2979
01:24:08,801 --> 01:24:11,740
fucking farmers out there in
the middle of Pennsylvania,

2980
01:24:11,741 --> 01:24:12,540
and that's it.

2981
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,280
It's shit that's not going to fly anymore.

2982
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,070
That's stupid.

2983
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:16,900
The electoral college is ridiculous.

2984
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,130
It should be one person,

2985
01:24:18,131 --> 01:24:18,671
one vote,

2986
01:24:18,671 --> 01:24:19,241
one adult,

2987
01:24:19,241 --> 01:24:19,691
one vote,

2988
01:24:19,691 --> 01:24:21,070
and she'd be able to vote online.

2989
01:24:21,071 --> 01:24:21,904
You fucks.

2990
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,200
It should be real simple.

2991
01:24:23,201 --> 01:24:24,820
You should be able to register with a,

2992
01:24:24,821 --> 01:24:26,530
a personal id number,

2993
01:24:26,531 --> 01:24:26,911
like your,

2994
01:24:26,911 --> 01:24:28,330
your credit card information.

2995
01:24:28,331 --> 01:24:30,030
There should be some steps
that you have to go to.

2996
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:31,000
Authenticity,

2997
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:32,373
authenticity,

2998
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,513
authenticity,

2999
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:34,840
authenticate,

3000
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:35,890
authenticate your identity.

3001
01:24:35,891 --> 01:24:36,581
And then as soon as he hit,

3002
01:24:36,581 --> 01:24:37,970
they authentic you.

3003
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:39,970
As soon as they get you
and they identify you,

3004
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:40,810
then you should be able to vote.

3005
01:24:40,811 --> 01:24:45,811
They shouldn't be some crazy electorial
college and you have to go to some place

3006
01:24:45,971 --> 01:24:47,290
and your register and it's,

3007
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:49,990
it's difficult to get in line to vote.

3008
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:51,810
You got to wait and get
off work and you're,

3009
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:52,091
well,

3010
01:24:52,091 --> 01:24:52,841
I'm going to go vote,

3011
01:24:52,841 --> 01:24:55,730
so I got to leave now and
beat the rush and come on.

3012
01:24:55,731 --> 01:24:58,030
And they're still stuck out
here at 12 had a felony,

3013
01:24:58,031 --> 01:25:01,630
says 1987 and they're still fucking
up sending me shit the vote though.

3014
01:25:01,631 --> 01:25:02,190
That's funny.

3015
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:07,190
Well I got to go down there for months
and argue with those people don't.

3016
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:08,980
It's hilarious.

3017
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:11,260
They send me be jewelry doing well
then you do a background check.

3018
01:25:11,261 --> 01:25:12,070
Yes we did.

3019
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:13,300
You're eligible for jury duty.

3020
01:25:13,301 --> 01:25:15,730
Can you believe that in a pan that
you're eligible for jury duty?

3021
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,790
Can you fucked your fucking 19
felonies and I'm eligible for fucking,

3022
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:21,220
you had to pay an attorney
to get you out of that.

3023
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:21,521
Well,

3024
01:25:21,521 --> 01:25:23,050
I had a lie cause I had to call him.

3025
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:23,651
I had a movie.

3026
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:24,730
I was going somewhere else.

3027
01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:25,900
So you gotta do what you gotta do.

3028
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:26,734
You know what I'm saying?

3029
01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:30,280
Sorry about that chocolate bar.

3030
01:25:30,281 --> 01:25:31,114
Fuck me up.

3031
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,290
It's all right man.

3032
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:33,160
I know what you're doing.

3033
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:33,993
Just having fun.

3034
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:35,151
No,

3035
01:25:35,151 --> 01:25:35,331
no,

3036
01:25:35,331 --> 01:25:35,611
no.

3037
01:25:35,611 --> 01:25:36,444
Watch the Olympics.

3038
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:37,510
Fuck No.

3039
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:37,990
I watched,

3040
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:39,010
we talked about the,

3041
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:41,230
these little men fly
through the air barefoot,

3042
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:44,180
like watch the little
price on and I watched the,

3043
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,030
I can't watch the basketball.

3044
01:25:46,031 --> 01:25:47,610
I watch the gymnastics a little bit.

3045
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:49,360
It's interesting when it's happening.

3046
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:50,570
It's sort of a,

3047
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:54,520
what I like about the Olympics is it
becomes like sort of a national festivity.

3048
01:25:54,770 --> 01:25:57,880
Like everybody's like everybody's
rooting for us and excited.

3049
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,700
Apparently the boxing team
had the worst showing ever.

3050
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,830
The boxing team didn't metal it all.

3051
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:03,860
It is really fucked up.

3052
01:26:03,861 --> 01:26:03,980
It's

3053
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,060
like a first time ever.

3054
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:07,250
Nobody's boxing them.

3055
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:08,900
I wonder if that's what people said.

3056
01:26:08,901 --> 01:26:09,734
Fuck it.

3057
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:11,023
Shit.

3058
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:11,720
I ain't,

3059
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,141
you know what?

3060
01:26:12,141 --> 01:26:12,891
I bet you're right.

3061
01:26:12,891 --> 01:26:14,900
I was watching wrestling
today when I was at the y.

3062
01:26:14,901 --> 01:26:15,880
Wrestling was on the side,

3063
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:18,410
so I didn't really
understand what's going on,

3064
01:26:18,411 --> 01:26:19,101
but the bottom now,

3065
01:26:19,101 --> 01:26:19,934
what happened with the,

3066
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:21,080
the judo Cuban guy,

3067
01:26:21,081 --> 01:26:22,060
he hit the refaced hub.

3068
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:23,620
Did you hear somebody who'd been done?

3069
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:23,850
Yes.

3070
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:24,720
A taekwondo guy.

3071
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:30,270
I saw this basketball game
where somebody just like,

3072
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:31,490
like he seriously,

3073
01:26:31,491 --> 01:26:34,010
he just ran into the guy and
pretty much almost punched.

3074
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,750
He says ball out of it.

3075
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:36,081
Yeah.

3076
01:26:36,081 --> 01:26:38,000
There's a lot of people
getting fucking uptight.

3077
01:26:38,001 --> 01:26:38,271
I mean,

3078
01:26:38,271 --> 01:26:40,730
you think about the pressure
involved and being in the Olympics,

3079
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:44,870
you represent your whole country
and flying through the air

3080
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:51,590
and just trying to land perfect and
that all your life has been built up for

3081
01:26:51,591 --> 01:26:55,130
this moment to practice
all for this one moment,

3082
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:57,530
just hurling yourself to the air flipping

3083
01:26:59,200 --> 01:26:59,960
fucking feeling.

3084
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:00,711
It's gonna be insane.

3085
01:27:00,711 --> 01:27:02,270
It's gotta be a great feeling to what?

3086
01:27:02,271 --> 01:27:03,104
A battle.

3087
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:05,870
It just got to be a great feeling to
just be able to go to the Olympics.

3088
01:27:05,871 --> 01:27:06,590
Fuck it.

3089
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:07,910
And just to win a silver,

3090
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:08,960
whatever the fuck you do.

3091
01:27:08,961 --> 01:27:12,350
You think you could drop Michael Phelps
off in the middle of the ocean and he

3092
01:27:12,351 --> 01:27:13,670
would find a way to get to the shore?

3093
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:14,533
Yeah.

3094
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:15,080
Do you think,

3095
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,640
how long do you think it
would take that guy to drown?

3096
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:18,853
Three days.

3097
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:19,700
70 days.

3098
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,200
Seven days I think.

3099
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:22,400
I think you could do two days.

3100
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:23,540
No,

3101
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:24,341
two days swimming.

3102
01:27:24,341 --> 01:27:25,670
A couple super athlete,

3103
01:27:25,671 --> 01:27:26,450
man.

3104
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:28,280
He's a super athlete and it's saltwater.

3105
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:29,590
Just float up the oceans.

3106
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,433
Get a little boy.

3107
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:31,830
Yeah,

3108
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:32,661
he was swimming the pool.

3109
01:27:32,661 --> 01:27:33,690
When you imagine,

3110
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,120
imagine if you get dropped off.

3111
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:35,690
Okay.

3112
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:40,690
To your right in one mile is an island
to your left in 2000 miles is the shore.

3113
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:43,880
And where do you go?

3114
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:44,781
Do you go left?

3115
01:27:44,781 --> 01:27:45,510
You go right?

3116
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:46,343
You imagine,

3117
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:47,000
fuck,

3118
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,870
I don't know which way to go.

3119
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,100
But you don't know where the island is.

3120
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:50,690
You don't know you're in the middle.

3121
01:27:50,691 --> 01:27:51,231
All you see,

3122
01:27:51,231 --> 01:27:54,050
you could get in a spot in the
water where all you see is water.

3123
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:54,913
Right?

3124
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:58,370
And could you imagine that
decision go left or go right?

3125
01:27:58,460 --> 01:27:59,540
How do you trust your instincts?

3126
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:02,870
How do you not second guess yourself
to tune yourself into true north?

3127
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,170
I didn't know what the fucking land,

3128
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:05,810
think about those fucking Cuban's Bro.

3129
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:06,500
Oh yeah.

3130
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,520
That build the shit.

3131
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:08,690
And they tell him that you have,

3132
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:09,740
and they have systems,

3133
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:12,920
like there's people that have done
it and then failed and gone back.

3134
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:16,040
And these guys are like the people
who come over and help you like this,

3135
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:16,874
but you gotta do,

3136
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:17,841
you gotta go dad,

3137
01:28:17,841 --> 01:28:19,730
you gotta leave at when the tide is high,

3138
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:22,390
you just don't get in the
fucking ocean and sweat.

3139
01:28:22,391 --> 01:28:23,900
And they have like a whole process.

3140
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:24,711
You have to go on.

3141
01:28:24,711 --> 01:28:25,544
The tide is high.

3142
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:28,840
There's not a blondie
song when the tide is,

3143
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:35,710
I want to be a no,

3144
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:37,703
no.

3145
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:42,110
You know,

3146
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:45,000
that's why when you always
set them at Nick Diaz,

3147
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:45,863
Webster,

3148
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,570
whatever the found out for trust,

3149
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:47,960
man,

3150
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,850
I gotta tell you that's
one of the roughest waters.

3151
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:51,080
That's one of the coldest water.

3152
01:28:51,370 --> 01:28:52,940
What are the most shocking fest awards?

3153
01:28:53,450 --> 01:28:55,850
You can be in a pool and it's 60 degrees,

3154
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:56,451
right?

3155
01:28:56,451 --> 01:28:57,680
But once you jump in the fucking,

3156
01:28:57,681 --> 01:28:58,514
oh shit.

3157
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:00,650
I don't know how cold the ocean is dirty.

3158
01:29:00,651 --> 01:29:01,980
Maybe it's cold as fuck

3159
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,750
and the whole nine 30
but then it would be ice.

3160
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,090
But I know that I fucking
making slows down.

3161
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:06,650
Yeah,

3162
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:08,880
it does something to
your joints and to your,

3163
01:29:08,881 --> 01:29:09,980
to your muscles contract.

3164
01:29:09,981 --> 01:29:10,814
So you're off

3165
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:13,570
getting cold water.

3166
01:29:13,571 --> 01:29:15,160
It's really hard to breathe.

3167
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:15,941
I was,

3168
01:29:15,941 --> 01:29:16,320
uh,

3169
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,910
you know that dude who's a WWE star,

3170
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:19,960
the Miz,

3171
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:20,681
do you know who he is?

3172
01:29:20,681 --> 01:29:23,470
And now I think he was on like
real world or something like that.

3173
01:29:23,471 --> 01:29:24,161
One of those shows.

3174
01:29:24,161 --> 01:29:29,161
But then he was a pro wrestler and he
came on a fear factor once and I'm telling

3175
01:29:29,981 --> 01:29:30,071
you,

3176
01:29:30,071 --> 01:29:30,221
man,

3177
01:29:30,221 --> 01:29:31,660
we had a lot of people on fear factor,

3178
01:29:31,661 --> 01:29:35,800
but this motherfucker was the most fit
guy we ever had on fear factor period.

3179
01:29:35,801 --> 01:29:38,380
Like no doubt he would
do like hundreds of,

3180
01:29:38,381 --> 01:29:38,800
uh,

3181
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,180
those bodyweight squats.

3182
01:29:40,181 --> 01:29:42,760
And he was a wrestler and like
the dude was like in serious,

3183
01:29:42,761 --> 01:29:45,190
serious condition in cold water.

3184
01:29:45,191 --> 01:29:47,770
It was fucking freezing out in cold water.

3185
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:52,780
This motherfucker jumped into a tank
and did all this shit and moved all this

3186
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,940
for two minutes and 20 seconds.

3187
01:29:54,941 --> 01:29:57,040
Everybody else had to go up
for your hair and go back down,

3188
01:29:57,041 --> 01:30:01,810
go up for air and go back down this to
just read and just jumped in and did the

3189
01:30:01,811 --> 01:30:02,500
whole fuck.

3190
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:05,530
It's freezing cold water to
smoke the joy in his life.

3191
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,170
How he's been eating wheat
grass and running hills.

3192
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:08,921
Let me tell you,

3193
01:30:08,921 --> 01:30:09,490
someone you,

3194
01:30:09,490 --> 01:30:10,570
when I drowned at the y,

3195
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:11,200
that time,

3196
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,450
that's how I almost drowned
because that's what got me,

3197
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:14,270
what I wish.

3198
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:17,880
I don't know why fucking seven years
ago I thought the longest yard,

3199
01:30:17,890 --> 01:30:18,280
Bro.

3200
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,580
Why told us,

3201
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,930
tell the bid onstage that's ever told me,

3202
01:30:21,931 --> 01:30:22,360
bro,

3203
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:23,051
you never told me.

3204
01:30:23,051 --> 01:30:23,381
You know,

3205
01:30:23,381 --> 01:30:26,620
when I was embarrassed and I went to the
y one day I asked the guy to train me

3206
01:30:26,621 --> 01:30:27,441
and I got on the treadmill.

3207
01:30:27,441 --> 01:30:30,120
Michael only do three
minutes while he sat me down.

3208
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:30,480
He goes,

3209
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:30,640
yeah,

3210
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:31,840
you got to quit smoking and B,

3211
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:32,703
I'll lose weight.

3212
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:33,190
You can't.

3213
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:33,421
He goes,

3214
01:30:33,421 --> 01:30:34,241
you got to hurt your joints.

3215
01:30:34,241 --> 01:30:35,350
If you walk on the treadmill,

3216
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:35,951
he goes,

3217
01:30:35,951 --> 01:30:36,501
go on the pool.

3218
01:30:36,501 --> 01:30:36,791
And I'm like,

3219
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:37,624
you're a genius.

3220
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:38,810
The pool's not.

3221
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:40,810
So I would go early and
going to training pool,

3222
01:30:40,811 --> 01:30:42,010
which is 90 degrees,

3223
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:42,700
right?

3224
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:43,181
The water,

3225
01:30:43,181 --> 01:30:44,020
you're in the water.

3226
01:30:44,050 --> 01:30:44,471
Oh,

3227
01:30:44,471 --> 01:30:46,660
you get when you go and maybe
be why you got to look at you.

3228
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:48,280
You're doing back shit.

3229
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:49,710
You're flipping up the water.

3230
01:30:49,730 --> 01:30:51,100
You're like fucking splash,

3231
01:30:51,310 --> 01:30:52,390
your throwing side kicks.

3232
01:30:52,391 --> 01:30:54,040
You're throwing punches like Muhammad Ali.

3233
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:56,380
But one day I went and it was fucking,

3234
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:56,880
uh,

3235
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:57,713
the afternoon.

3236
01:30:58,150 --> 01:30:59,740
So I had to go into the Olympic Pool.

3237
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:01,210
You've got to go sign your name.

3238
01:31:01,211 --> 01:31:01,591
And I thought,

3239
01:31:01,591 --> 01:31:01,760
you know,

3240
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,160
I haven't been swimming for two weeks.

3241
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:04,900
You know I could do this.

3242
01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:05,650
I got this.

3243
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:06,280
That's what I went,

3244
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:06,640
right.

3245
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:07,730
I had swam in Boulder,

3246
01:31:07,731 --> 01:31:08,880
the masters from program,

3247
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:12,190
so actually just could took a couple of
weeks to get the the ship back to you.

3248
01:31:12,191 --> 01:31:13,060
I didn't know Bro.

3249
01:31:13,450 --> 01:31:17,530
I signed up and I jumped in the middle
lane at the YMC Andy Olympic Pool.

3250
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:19,230
Yeah.

3251
01:31:19,230 --> 01:31:21,900
That water's like fucking
42 or whatever it is.

3252
01:31:21,901 --> 01:31:23,220
As soon as I hit Joe Rogan,

3253
01:31:23,221 --> 01:31:26,240
everything just froze and my
fat little legs were moving.

3254
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:27,721
I wasn't moving.

3255
01:31:27,721 --> 01:31:31,410
I was just spinning around in circles
because I think once the water gets cold,

3256
01:31:31,411 --> 01:31:33,030
it's even harder to maneuver in that.

3257
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:33,893
Oh yeah.

3258
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,610
I hadn't done it in a lot.

3259
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:36,440
Listening.

3260
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,830
Your body freezes up.

3261
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:38,381
Listen Bro,

3262
01:31:38,381 --> 01:31:38,941
I'm Baldwin.

3263
01:31:38,941 --> 01:31:40,410
I'm the witness to this and bolden.

3264
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:42,270
She does that class outside year round.

3265
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:45,270
What class a masters from
a program has done outside.

3266
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:46,021
Oh Wow.

3267
01:31:46,021 --> 01:31:47,760
So when you get there on your bicycle,

3268
01:31:48,150 --> 01:31:48,983
they shovel.

3269
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:51,453
Oh yeah.

3270
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,530
So you run from the front.

3271
01:31:53,531 --> 01:31:54,790
So that's the pools outside.

3272
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:56,640
I still got a change
in the side of bolden.

3273
01:31:56,690 --> 01:31:57,040
Right.

3274
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:01,840
Those crazy fucking wash walk from
that hut to the pool and the snow,

3275
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:04,000
they just parked the fucking snow,

3276
01:32:04,001 --> 01:32:09,001
you know that just they make a path
and how pools heated to pool is heated.

3277
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:11,920
So they just climbing the pool.

3278
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:13,090
But the pool is awesome.

3279
01:32:13,091 --> 01:32:14,380
The pool's not that either.

3280
01:32:14,381 --> 01:32:15,214
Not Jacuzzi.

3281
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:16,270
This is older.

3282
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:17,530
This is James.

3283
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:18,550
This lady was crazy.

3284
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:18,881
It is.

3285
01:32:18,881 --> 01:32:20,120
Even if the water is heated,

3286
01:32:20,121 --> 01:32:20,450
it's still,

3287
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:21,250
it's fucking,

3288
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:22,390
when your head gets wet,

3289
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:25,270
pop your head out and
it's 10 degrees outside.

3290
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:26,780
Even if the water is 90 degrees,

3291
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,420
it's still sucks.

3292
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:29,650
You don't see that fucking
steam coming off that water.

3293
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,090
But I jumped into this.

3294
01:32:31,091 --> 01:32:31,381
Why?

3295
01:32:31,381 --> 01:32:33,670
And I go into the middle and
I'm trying to get out of that.

3296
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:35,620
Joan is these two Mexican kids like Mr,

3297
01:32:35,621 --> 01:32:36,221
can we help it?

3298
01:32:36,221 --> 01:32:36,510
I'm like,

3299
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:37,343
fuck yeah.

3300
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,610
So I tried to pull me out
and they can't pull me out.

3301
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:40,481
So they go,

3302
01:32:40,481 --> 01:32:41,021
we'll get you,

3303
01:32:41,021 --> 01:32:41,591
we'll save you.

3304
01:32:41,591 --> 01:32:43,220
And they go and Austin and
they brought her hoisting.

3305
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:46,060
So a whole waste is what they
put in the middle of the thing.

3306
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:47,830
And they wanted me to
swim back into the middle.

3307
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,860
I was gonna go in there with my fat little
Orca body and they were going to pull

3308
01:32:50,861 --> 01:32:52,060
me out like they pulled Orca.

3309
01:32:52,061 --> 01:32:52,691
That's a hoist.

3310
01:32:52,691 --> 01:32:52,871
Right?

3311
01:32:52,871 --> 01:32:53,530
Right.

3312
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:53,951
And I'm like,

3313
01:32:53,951 --> 01:32:54,191
Dawg,

3314
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:55,240
I'm drowning here.

3315
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:56,680
I can't go back to the middle.

3316
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:58,030
And then also they press,

3317
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,140
they call the ambulance.

3318
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:00,640
So the ambulance came,

3319
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:01,550
but I didn't sign.

3320
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:04,220
I ain't paying the 1800 I
ran out of that before I,

3321
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,060
I'm happy I got the fuck out of
there before the ambulance came,

3322
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:09,070
as they were coming in with the thing,

3323
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:10,180
I was walking out.

3324
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:11,170
Wow.

3325
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:13,510
And I never went back to the
why for about six months.

3326
01:33:13,511 --> 01:33:14,710
I was so fucking embarrassed.

3327
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,240
I'm going to drowned at the Hollywood.

3328
01:33:16,241 --> 01:33:16,890
Why Bro?

3329
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:17,680
Wow.

3330
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:18,640
Just unprepared.

3331
01:33:18,641 --> 01:33:22,540
Just wanting to that water and it was
cold and my lungs just fucking froze.

3332
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:23,883
Stopped.

3333
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:26,170
How often are you working on now for,

3334
01:33:26,290 --> 01:33:27,160
but I'm not swimming.

3335
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:29,560
Did you change anything
about your diet when you,

3336
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:31,150
when we did that Mike Dolce parking?

3337
01:33:31,330 --> 01:33:32,163
Yeah.

3338
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:32,470
I,

3339
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:32,830
you know,

3340
01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:34,130
I liked the dolce stuff,

3341
01:33:34,131 --> 01:33:34,660
but I don't like,

3342
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:37,810
I don't like a lot of weird vegetables
I never have and I'm not going to eat

3343
01:33:37,811 --> 01:33:38,710
them at this time.

3344
01:33:38,711 --> 01:33:40,000
I'm not going to really fucking meet them.

3345
01:33:40,001 --> 01:33:40,270
You know,

3346
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:44,620
I eat a man that had it done and that's
really been good is I finally got the

3347
01:33:44,621 --> 01:33:45,011
spark,

3348
01:33:45,011 --> 01:33:46,780
was water in my kitchen and yeah.

3349
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:47,710
And uh,

3350
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:48,543
I don't drink shorter.

3351
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:49,210
Good.

3352
01:33:49,210 --> 01:33:50,350
That's beautiful water.

3353
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:50,951
That's beautiful.

3354
01:33:50,951 --> 01:33:52,870
And that a lot more water.

3355
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:54,850
This is what you got to
get in your head to water.

3356
01:33:54,851 --> 01:33:55,810
Tastes fucking good.

3357
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,560
Water tastes good.

3358
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,393
It tastes good.

3359
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:57,940
You know,

3360
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:59,300
it's not like cold calling.

3361
01:33:59,410 --> 01:34:00,280
Eat a soda.

3362
01:34:00,281 --> 01:34:02,350
Like sometimes warranty
is better than soda.

3363
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:04,030
Like he just in your head,

3364
01:34:04,031 --> 01:34:04,571
the sodas,

3365
01:34:04,571 --> 01:34:05,500
like the naughty thing,

3366
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:06,610
but a meatball sandwich.

3367
01:34:06,611 --> 01:34:07,610
You got to get a beer with him.

3368
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:08,561
You know what I'm saying?

3369
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:10,510
Like if we're going to get a
sausage sandwich right now,

3370
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:11,493
you gotta get out.

3371
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:12,311
You know,

3372
01:34:12,311 --> 01:34:16,000
there's certain things that you
gotta get a cocktail with or a,

3373
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:19,480
a fucking something water doesn't
taste good with something,

3374
01:34:19,481 --> 01:34:20,920
has no taste too well.

3375
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:22,870
When you're talking about for enjoyment.

3376
01:34:22,871 --> 01:34:23,501
For food.

3377
01:34:23,501 --> 01:34:24,100
Yeah,

3378
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:24,671
for sure.

3379
01:34:24,671 --> 01:34:26,950
But like as far as like a clean taste,

3380
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:29,350
if water was rare and you know,

3381
01:34:29,351 --> 01:34:33,250
and and may very well be some day and
may very well be some day that our gen in

3382
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:34,210
our future generations,

3383
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:36,940
we fucked up so bad that
water becomes like valuable.

3384
01:34:36,941 --> 01:34:38,740
I looked up you could only drink soda.

3385
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:40,090
I did look up what you told me.

3386
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:43,360
We were in trouble as far as why
they leasing up these rivers,

3387
01:34:43,361 --> 01:34:44,194
bro.

3388
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:46,150
We discussed it for water.

3389
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:47,170
Water.

3390
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:48,170
I think they leased out,

3391
01:34:48,171 --> 01:34:51,490
I don't know how many fucking
rivers in 2000 for bottled waters.

3392
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:52,613
Bottled water.

3393
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:52,991
Yeah.

3394
01:34:52,991 --> 01:34:56,760
Well it's so funny if you think
about water because you know,

3395
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:58,250
water new water hasn't

3396
01:34:58,250 --> 01:34:59,960
been made for millions of years.

3397
01:34:59,961 --> 01:35:00,090
Yeah.

3398
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:00,831
So like we're,

3399
01:35:00,831 --> 01:35:01,581
we're fucking,

3400
01:35:01,581 --> 01:35:01,940
you know,

3401
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:05,510
drinking water that Jesus
pooped out at one point.

3402
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:06,230
You know,

3403
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:09,530
the water just gets recycled and
recycled and stuff like that.

3404
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:12,460
It actually comes here and it goes
towards to comes here and comets.

3405
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:13,370
Yeah.

3406
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:15,800
When you see a comment flying
across the Scott at trail,

3407
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:16,431
that's a,

3408
01:35:16,431 --> 01:35:17,420
that's a melting ice.

3409
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:18,530
That's what that is.

3410
01:35:18,530 --> 01:35:22,310
So we get really small amounts
of water from the earth,

3411
01:35:22,311 --> 01:35:23,420
from the earth was born.

3412
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,950
We had been hit by you know,

3413
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:26,421
many,

3414
01:35:26,421 --> 01:35:29,180
many different asteroids and
many bodies from outer space,

3415
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:32,420
but very likely you've been hit by
giant slabs of ice from outer space.

3416
01:35:32,421 --> 01:35:36,980
And that the water that we have on this
earth comes from other planets and that

3417
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:42,040
every thing in this world is extra
terrestrial because the whole,

3418
01:35:42,230 --> 01:35:43,280
the whole planet,

3419
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:47,750
it's been created by things that have
come from other planets that have been

3420
01:35:47,751 --> 01:35:48,584
sucked into it.

3421
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:49,610
It's not like,

3422
01:35:49,670 --> 01:35:50,031
you know,

3423
01:35:50,031 --> 01:35:52,400
it wasn't like there was a
thing and it was the earth,

3424
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:53,120
the thing,

3425
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,890
the earth was nailed by asteroids.

3426
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,740
The moon was created because
it was hit by another planet.

3427
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:01,550
Like a lot of shit has hit it and
comments have hit the earth apparently and

3428
01:36:01,551 --> 01:36:04,130
dropped water and that's like
where all the water comes from.

3429
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:04,521
Yeah.

3430
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:08,840
But isn't it like on fire when
it's entering the earth too big?

3431
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:12,680
You know you're talking about a piece
of ice that's who knows how many fucking

3432
01:36:12,681 --> 01:36:17,681
miles wide and it actually survives
reentry and try to wrap your head around

3433
01:36:18,561 --> 01:36:18,980
that.

3434
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:22,460
Try to have wrap your head around a
piece of ice that can survive reentry.

3435
01:36:22,461 --> 01:36:23,450
How big does that have to be?

3436
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:25,760
This guy is old and you live in boulder,

3437
01:36:25,761 --> 01:36:26,170
you know,

3438
01:36:26,170 --> 01:36:26,870
do all that.

3439
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:27,111
You know,

3440
01:36:27,111 --> 01:36:28,600
you smoke dope and he'd go to old.

3441
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:30,350
A lot of hippie things.

3442
01:36:30,590 --> 01:36:31,341
Let me just say one thing.

3443
01:36:31,341 --> 01:36:32,500
It might not survive the entry.

3444
01:36:32,501 --> 01:36:33,640
You might get burned up in the atmosphere.

3445
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:34,503
It comes storms.

3446
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:35,330
The fuck knows.

3447
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:37,160
I don't know how many of
them actually do land,

3448
01:36:37,161 --> 01:36:39,290
but I do know that the water
that we have is from other,

3449
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:42,320
a lot of it they believe is
from like a pence barrier.

3450
01:36:42,321 --> 01:36:43,430
The idea that comes from asteroids,

3451
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:48,490
so you can almost say that our waters
could be being like ingredients added to

3452
01:36:49,671 --> 01:36:51,260
it from aliens.

3453
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,193
You could be,

3454
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:53,451
if you don't have water,

3455
01:36:53,451 --> 01:36:54,284
did come here,

3456
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:55,041
come here.

3457
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:57,200
It could have had biological
entities frozen side of it,

3458
01:36:57,201 --> 01:37:01,220
so that's how they give us the firmware
upgrades is from fucking comment water.

3459
01:37:01,221 --> 01:37:01,521
They're like,

3460
01:37:01,521 --> 01:37:01,851
all right,

3461
01:37:01,851 --> 01:37:02,280
we're going to,

3462
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:02,510
yeah,

3463
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:03,440
well that could be that.

3464
01:37:03,441 --> 01:37:04,670
That's what asteroids are.

3465
01:37:04,671 --> 01:37:06,560
It's like the reset
button software updates.

3466
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:07,820
It says reset button.

3467
01:37:07,821 --> 01:37:09,530
Let's why they had to
get rid of the dinosaurs.

3468
01:37:09,531 --> 01:37:10,400
They got too crazy.

3469
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,380
Like maybe the dinosaurs
would be like a good idea.

3470
01:37:12,381 --> 01:37:13,250
It'd be like tigers.

3471
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:15,700
We've kind of keep control of them
but still maintain some sort of a

3472
01:37:15,701 --> 01:37:16,534
civilization.

3473
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,860
But t rex just got way too fucking big,

3474
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:19,820
you know this giant,

3475
01:37:19,821 --> 01:37:20,660
huge lizard.

3476
01:37:20,661 --> 01:37:22,370
Just run it through
villages eating people.

3477
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:24,110
So they had to just Jack Amal,

3478
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:25,040
start fresh,

3479
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:27,110
boom media impact.

3480
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:29,540
One of those geniuses and bold.

3481
01:37:29,541 --> 01:37:31,790
I took a course from time and evolution,

3482
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,040
just some shitty three critic thing.

3483
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:39,500
This guy was saying that the world was
a lot fucking bigger and circumference

3484
01:37:39,501 --> 01:37:40,334
diameter,

3485
01:37:41,210 --> 01:37:42,380
but over the years before,

3486
01:37:42,381 --> 01:37:44,090
well you were saying all the hits,

3487
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:45,710
it's gotten down.

3488
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:47,350
Really it gets smaller.

3489
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:48,440
That's what he was feeling.

3490
01:37:48,441 --> 01:37:50,150
That's what his theory was.

3491
01:37:50,151 --> 01:37:50,751
That theory,

3492
01:37:50,751 --> 01:37:51,230
whatever.

3493
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:52,190
This is 20 years ago,

3494
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:53,803
but he was saying,

3495
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:54,651
think about it.

3496
01:37:54,651 --> 01:37:55,210
He goes,

3497
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:56,250
these were the bottom.

3498
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:56,791
He goes,

3499
01:37:56,791 --> 01:37:57,950
even when we walk around and,

3500
01:37:58,040 --> 01:37:59,670
and all those mountains
where the bottom of that,

3501
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:01,560
that was bigger at one time.

3502
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:02,110
Yeah.

3503
01:38:02,110 --> 01:38:02,500
We feel,

3504
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:02,760
you know,

3505
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:03,421
these people,

3506
01:38:03,421 --> 01:38:05,010
whatever felt that it was big.

3507
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:07,980
We just been getting it
for the last million years.

3508
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:09,061
It's really creepy.

3509
01:38:09,061 --> 01:38:10,080
So when you look at the moon,

3510
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,000
because the moon doesn't
have anything up there,

3511
01:38:12,001 --> 01:38:13,830
it's just this one surface color,

3512
01:38:14,110 --> 01:38:14,320
you know,

3513
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,270
it doesn't vary that much.

3514
01:38:15,271 --> 01:38:16,051
So when you look at it,

3515
01:38:16,051 --> 01:38:18,840
all you're seeing is
she's fucking craters.

3516
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:20,160
There's no atmosphere.

3517
01:38:20,161 --> 01:38:21,240
So they don't get burnt up.

3518
01:38:21,241 --> 01:38:22,074
They just hit it.

3519
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:23,340
So you just see doom,

3520
01:38:23,341 --> 01:38:23,791
doom,

3521
01:38:23,791 --> 01:38:24,511
doom everywhere.

3522
01:38:24,511 --> 01:38:26,330
The whole thing's just pockmark like,

3523
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:30,510
like that dude's face from
was such as names almost.

3524
01:38:30,511 --> 01:38:31,330
That's the guy.

3525
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:32,163
Yeah.

3526
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:32,551
I mean,

3527
01:38:32,551 --> 01:38:33,384
come on man.

3528
01:38:34,150 --> 01:38:34,983
If,

3529
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:37,290
if that,

3530
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:39,180
that's how many are coming at us.

3531
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,310
All those holes that are on the moon,

3532
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:42,990
if that's how many
things are coming at us.

3533
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,310
Some of those are big,

3534
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,120
but there's some really big
craters was the last time we got,

3535
01:38:47,121 --> 01:38:47,911
I don't know,

3536
01:38:47,911 --> 01:38:50,100
but speculation has been,

3537
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:50,490
uh,

3538
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:50,970
most,

3539
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:55,970
most recent big one they think was
about somewhere around 12,000 years ago,

3540
01:38:56,670 --> 01:39:00,810
10 to 12,000 years ago because
they found all of this.

3541
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:01,310
Um,

3542
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:05,430
it's a type of molten rock that
occurs during nuclear tests,

3543
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:06,240
um,

3544
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:11,240
and it also occurs during meteor impacts
and they found it all over the world at

3545
01:39:12,031 --> 01:39:14,190
this same core level.

3546
01:39:14,350 --> 01:39:14,530
Uh,

3547
01:39:14,530 --> 01:39:19,500
when they do call a soil samples and then
they go down to between 10 and 12,000

3548
01:39:19,501 --> 01:39:19,711
years,

3549
01:39:19,711 --> 01:39:21,210
I believe it is somewhere in that range.

3550
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,490
That's where they keep
finding it all over the earth.

3551
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:24,930
And that's also,

3552
01:39:24,931 --> 01:39:25,590
um,

3553
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:30,570
significantly when the end of the
ice age sort of is like if you,

3554
01:39:30,571 --> 01:39:33,030
it's sort of coinciding
with the same time,

3555
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:33,301
like,

3556
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:33,670
you know,

3557
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:34,800
10,000 years ago,

3558
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:35,280
you know,

3559
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,540
that's when people were,

3560
01:39:36,541 --> 01:39:36,870
you know,

3561
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:38,430
making their way across here from,

3562
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:38,670
uh,

3563
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:40,020
from Russia on the Bering Strait.

3564
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:41,010
And that's when there's the,

3565
01:39:41,011 --> 01:39:41,250
the,

3566
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:46,170
the whole ice age of a 10,000 years ago
ended abruptly and a lot of animals died

3567
01:39:46,171 --> 01:39:47,190
in mass extinction.

3568
01:39:47,191 --> 01:39:48,690
Events like woolly mammoths,

3569
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:51,180
saber tooth tigers died in mass graves.

3570
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:54,720
And the speculation is that was the last
big meteor shower and that somewhere

3571
01:39:54,721 --> 01:39:56,310
around 10 to 12,000 years ago,

3572
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:57,330
you know,

3573
01:39:57,330 --> 01:40:00,540
most of the civilization got
fucked sideways all over again.

3574
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:02,220
A lot of people start all over again.

3575
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:03,630
And that explains a lot of things.

3576
01:40:03,631 --> 01:40:07,530
It explains a lot of ancient buildings
that nobody knows how the fuck they built

3577
01:40:07,531 --> 01:40:08,160
them.

3578
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:08,993
It's most,

3579
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,760
most likely that we had went on a,

3580
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:15,300
we had gotten a very high
level of sophistication.

3581
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:16,020
I say we,

3582
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:18,720
they the people in a
bunch of different shit,

3583
01:40:19,050 --> 01:40:20,130
but um,

3584
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:22,830
we went in a totally different
path once we rebuilt.

3585
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:24,340
And then our path when we,

3586
01:40:24,341 --> 01:40:27,810
when we rebuilt was a little bit more
lost and became more technological in

3587
01:40:27,811 --> 01:40:28,500
nature.

3588
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,600
But you can't deny the
shit that they built.

3589
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:32,640
Just this to stuff they
built in in Greece.

3590
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:33,091
You know,

3591
01:40:33,091 --> 01:40:35,360
just really look at the
crop lips and the Parthenon.

3592
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:38,370
You think these motherfuckers built that
shit thousands and thousands of years

3593
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:42,060
ago on top of some shit that was
from thousands of years before that.

3594
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:44,010
It might've been a super advanced culture.

3595
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:44,971
You've got fucked up.

3596
01:40:44,971 --> 01:40:45,450
I immediately,

3597
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:46,470
cause I get a little fucked up,

3598
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,600
all this stuff that
they have in Greece now.

3599
01:40:49,130 --> 01:40:50,880
Was this also part of Greek mythology?

3600
01:40:50,881 --> 01:40:51,714
Like Medusa?

3601
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:52,920
Like why watch the clash of the,

3602
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:54,010
I'm just asking you

3603
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,580
guys,

3604
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:55,690
when the fuck was clad,

3605
01:40:55,691 --> 01:40:56,351
not to the ship,

3606
01:40:56,351 --> 01:40:58,750
they came out with the
original with Mark Hamill,

3607
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:01,630
whatever that ball fuck his
name is the original plan.

3608
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:06,250
I think if I had to guess with
the Greek gods were all about,

3609
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:09,100
I would have to guess you have to have,

3610
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:09,821
first of all,

3611
01:41:09,821 --> 01:41:13,780
some sort of an explanation
for storms and you know,

3612
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:17,380
we don't have to deal with
too much fucking weather
here in Sunny California and

3613
01:41:17,381 --> 01:41:19,090
we were getting pretty
soft because of that.

3614
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:22,600
But if you live on the east coast and
you've been anywhere near Hurricane,

3615
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:26,470
you know how God damn
terrifying mother nature can be.

3616
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,480
And if you're living in Greece,

3617
01:41:28,481 --> 01:41:28,721
I'm,

3618
01:41:28,721 --> 01:41:30,700
I'm assuming they get some sort of storms.

3619
01:41:30,701 --> 01:41:34,030
I'm assuming that they're leaders would
have to have some sort of an explanation

3620
01:41:34,031 --> 01:41:35,350
of what the fuck is going on.

3621
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:38,080
And I think it's a form of
expression in the and creativity.

3622
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:42,040
They figured out a way to create Thor
and Zeus and create this whole myth

3623
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:43,360
mythology behind it.

3624
01:41:43,361 --> 01:41:45,520
And it was probably just a calm,

3625
01:41:45,521 --> 01:41:47,770
everybody the fuck now and
keep everybody together.

3626
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:50,320
They probably had to have
some sort of an explanation.

3627
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:51,280
What is the lightning,

3628
01:41:51,281 --> 01:41:52,120
what is this?

3629
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:53,343
Oh,

3630
01:41:53,470 --> 01:41:54,700
it's a guy named Thor.

3631
01:41:54,701 --> 01:41:55,720
He's the god of thunder.

3632
01:41:55,990 --> 01:41:56,500
Okay.

3633
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:59,410
He's up there and he's
shooting lightning bolts down.

3634
01:41:59,411 --> 01:42:02,200
He's actually in a fight with
his brother who's a dick.

3635
01:42:02,201 --> 01:42:03,580
His brother's name is Loci.

3636
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:06,400
LOCI wants to run shit
and he's an asshole.

3637
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:06,630
All right,

3638
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:07,820
so what about gladiator?

3639
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:08,580
And then there's move.

3640
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:09,850
That shit wasn't that one.

3641
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:13,120
Zoosh was around Odin and
then there's Odin gladiator.

3642
01:42:13,121 --> 01:42:13,481
Was that one?

3643
01:42:13,481 --> 01:42:14,314
Zeus is around,

3644
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:19,580
not even the same gotry that's role
there was as the Roman gladiators.

3645
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:22,391
Yeah.

3646
01:42:22,391 --> 01:42:23,021
What's his face?

3647
01:42:23,021 --> 01:42:23,854
The actor.

3648
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:25,660
So he was his last great movie,

3649
01:42:25,661 --> 01:42:26,494
right?

3650
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:28,080
That was the best one he ever did.

3651
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:29,240
That was the best.

3652
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,073
That was iconic.

3653
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:31,001
That's like a,

3654
01:42:31,001 --> 01:42:32,510
that puts him in list of all,

3655
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,311
what the fuck is his name?

3656
01:42:33,311 --> 01:42:33,980
Russell Crowe.

3657
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:35,440
That puts him in the list of all time.

3658
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:38,410
Greatest movie stars is a
handful of five or 10 dudes.

3659
01:42:38,411 --> 01:42:39,100
He's right in there.

3660
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:40,440
That's a great fucking was amazing.

3661
01:42:40,450 --> 01:42:40,871
I loved them.

3662
01:42:40,871 --> 01:42:41,350
Amazing.

3663
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:41,681
We love,

3664
01:42:41,681 --> 01:42:43,420
you know what else was great in that camp,

3665
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:44,330
that cigarette movie,

3666
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,370
that's he,

3667
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:51,670
that guy can really abandoned
himself into a part.

3668
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:52,870
He's one of those few dudes,

3669
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:53,840
those few dudes at Chameleon.

3670
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:54,970
But you know with that too,

3671
01:42:54,971 --> 01:42:55,804
right?

3672
01:42:56,090 --> 01:42:56,720
The inside,

3673
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:57,041
yes,

3674
01:42:57,041 --> 01:42:57,874
but Chino.

3675
01:42:58,170 --> 01:43:01,080
But Chino plays the reporter
from 60 minutes to hold.

3676
01:43:01,081 --> 01:43:01,914
That's right.

3677
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:03,280
And his boss was Glenn,

3678
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:04,061
whatever.

3679
01:43:04,061 --> 01:43:04,990
He's fucking good.

3680
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:06,190
Yeah.

3681
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:06,311
I,

3682
01:43:06,311 --> 01:43:08,770
I still appreciate the fuck
out of a great movie like that,

3683
01:43:08,771 --> 01:43:09,041
but it's,

3684
01:43:09,041 --> 01:43:09,311
man,

3685
01:43:09,311 --> 01:43:09,911
it's just,

3686
01:43:09,911 --> 01:43:10,690
it's hard to,

3687
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:11,710
it's hard to find a good one.

3688
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:13,150
It's hard to find them like that.

3689
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:14,013
You know,

3690
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:18,430
you ever go back and watch like a movie
from the 70s when they were really like

3691
01:43:18,431 --> 01:43:19,360
art pieces,

3692
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:24,280
you know like they had big art pieces
like Lamons do you ever see Lamont's Steve

3693
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,600
Mcqueen and watched our recent
little bonds is fucking,

3694
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:29,800
nobody even talks for the first
like 15 minutes of that movie.

3695
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:31,940
It's a bunch of shit happening
where you watched them,

3696
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:33,250
this guy live in his life.

3697
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:34,810
I mean he's driving his car.

3698
01:43:34,811 --> 01:43:35,650
He doesn't say anything.

3699
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,150
He goes to locker room.

3700
01:43:37,151 --> 01:43:37,984
He doesn't say anything.

3701
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:39,050
I mean it's like you're,

3702
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,750
you're watching everything go out there.

3703
01:43:40,751 --> 01:43:42,850
It's telling you a story
without a single word.

3704
01:43:43,030 --> 01:43:44,200
It's really fascinating.

3705
01:43:44,201 --> 01:43:49,201
And I think if you're going to
use the visual medium of movie IG,

3706
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:52,010
that is one of the coolest
ways to tell a story because

3707
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,400
you don't,

3708
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:55,520
I mean that is the one thing that
you cannot achieve in writing.

3709
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:55,701
I mean,

3710
01:43:55,701 --> 01:43:57,650
if you say that it can never
live up to the writing,

3711
01:43:57,651 --> 01:44:02,180
well well this is where we're showing
you things with no dialogue whatsoever.

3712
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:02,811
You know,

3713
01:44:02,811 --> 01:44:03,644
like painting.

3714
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:07,670
That's what like one of the best ways
you can create with a visual medium,

3715
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:08,211
you know,

3716
01:44:08,211 --> 01:44:09,460
to not even use the word why,

3717
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:10,640
show me some shit.

3718
01:44:10,670 --> 01:44:13,520
Bait me into this conversation because
you know where it's going to go.

3719
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:14,150
Where's it going to?

3720
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:16,640
It's going to go back to the
best movies one where they made,

3721
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:17,181
you know,

3722
01:44:17,181 --> 01:44:18,620
if you watch her best songs,

3723
01:44:18,621 --> 01:44:19,241
when were they made?

3724
01:44:19,241 --> 01:44:19,400
Well,

3725
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,470
when they didn't really know
what they were doing yet.

3726
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:23,510
Lamont,

3727
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:25,970
if I put Lamont on for fucking red band,

3728
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:30,980
red will throw me out of his
house because red band is part of,

3729
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:32,210
uh,

3730
01:44:32,210 --> 01:44:32,450
you know,

3731
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:33,800
today we want a fast,

3732
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:34,821
like if you watch,

3733
01:44:34,821 --> 01:44:36,020
can you think from the 70s?

3734
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:37,020
It's a tough luck.

3735
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:39,800
The Godfather's easy.

3736
01:44:39,801 --> 01:44:40,970
The excesses is easy.

3737
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:45,350
But how best was won and they did
not have Twitter attention span.

3738
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:47,540
You have to understand.

3739
01:44:47,541 --> 01:44:48,374
So when we tell him,

3740
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:48,681
you know,

3741
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:49,550
I watched your movie,

3742
01:44:49,551 --> 01:44:50,870
the great movie,

3743
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:52,130
the friends addy coil,

3744
01:44:52,131 --> 01:44:53,510
what a crazy fucking movie.

3745
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:54,531
And it's still,

3746
01:44:54,531 --> 01:44:55,880
if you're with the wrong
people in the room,

3747
01:44:55,881 --> 01:44:56,241
they're going to go,

3748
01:44:56,241 --> 01:44:56,630
Joey,

3749
01:44:56,630 --> 01:44:57,351
you got to change it.

3750
01:44:57,351 --> 01:44:58,310
Before I fucked him flawless.

3751
01:44:58,350 --> 01:44:59,183
I learned that from him.

3752
01:44:59,190 --> 01:45:00,230
Anthony Bourdain too.

3753
01:45:00,231 --> 01:45:02,420
I was watching his show on Boston.

3754
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:03,670
He did a show on Boston,

3755
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:04,010
you know,

3756
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:05,180
grew up in Boston site.

3757
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:06,180
I was excited by it.

3758
01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:07,340
It was pretty interesting.

3759
01:45:07,341 --> 01:45:09,500
He decided to hang out
mostly in South Boston.

3760
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:10,640
Hung around and like,

3761
01:45:10,641 --> 01:45:14,750
like weird little places where you get
lobster sandwiches and real boxing gyms

3762
01:45:14,751 --> 01:45:15,201
and shit.

3763
01:45:15,201 --> 01:45:16,490
But then he brought up that movie.

3764
01:45:16,491 --> 01:45:17,330
I had never heard of it.

3765
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:21,420
Robert Mitchum movies from Moses
from the 73 and this movie,

3766
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:24,800
I mean if you want some ways
a lot of character actors,

3767
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:26,210
directors,

3768
01:45:26,210 --> 01:45:27,290
but those movies,

3769
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,080
they're pieces of wood.

3770
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:32,720
We discussed this with Charles
Bronson comes up and he goes,

3771
01:45:32,721 --> 01:45:34,220
did you bring all ours for me?

3772
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:36,643
No.

3773
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:38,210
One horse,

3774
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:39,530
you know to me fucked up.

3775
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:41,101
Yeah,

3776
01:45:41,101 --> 01:45:41,720
well no,

3777
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,190
you brought one to many.

3778
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,920
One to that takes 15 fucking minutes.

3779
01:45:45,921 --> 01:45:46,754
That scene,

3780
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:51,590
you will go Joey changes when he
gets off the train to bell rings,

3781
01:45:51,830 --> 01:45:53,300
the Crow Flies.

3782
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:55,040
Three guys walk this way.

3783
01:45:55,041 --> 01:45:56,840
Three guys walk this way again.

3784
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:59,240
If you want to go back to movie,

3785
01:45:59,241 --> 01:46:00,890
bad asses all time.

3786
01:46:00,891 --> 01:46:01,551
Great movie.

3787
01:46:01,551 --> 01:46:02,390
Bad asses.

3788
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:03,980
In my opinion,

3789
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:05,990
no one can fuck with Charles Bronson.

3790
01:46:06,230 --> 01:46:07,880
You can't fuck with Charles Bronson movie.

3791
01:46:07,881 --> 01:46:08,540
Bad asses.

3792
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:10,190
Legitimate real movie,

3793
01:46:10,191 --> 01:46:11,024
bad asses.

3794
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:12,040
You know as far as like,

3795
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:15,980
like a guy who really believed
I believed him in hard times.

3796
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:16,880
Okay.

3797
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:17,570
You know,

3798
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:19,280
I believe cleaning should a little bit,

3799
01:46:19,281 --> 01:46:22,760
but he did comedies like every which
way but loose and when you do those,

3800
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:25,970
there is a little something lost.

3801
01:46:25,971 --> 01:46:27,830
Charles Bronson never did a stupid comedy.

3802
01:46:27,831 --> 01:46:28,760
That wasn't that funny,

3803
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:29,450
you know?

3804
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:32,540
But still Vaughn has Stallone
had that one with his mother.

3805
01:46:32,630 --> 01:46:33,463
Yeah,

3806
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,300
my Momma Shit.

3807
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:34,960
Yeah.

3808
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:35,221
Stopping.

3809
01:46:35,221 --> 01:46:36,054
My mom will shoot.

3810
01:46:36,350 --> 01:46:37,183
What was the other one?

3811
01:46:37,370 --> 01:46:38,430
What was the point where Russell,

3812
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:42,920
he was a cop and it's one of
the worst movies of all time.

3813
01:46:42,921 --> 01:46:46,520
The dialogue is so bad in that movie with
him and Kurt Russell that people like

3814
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:47,540
replay it.

3815
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:51,990
They do it as like theater
art as a performance art
cause the the lyrics or it'd

3816
01:46:51,991 --> 01:46:52,201
be the,

3817
01:46:52,201 --> 01:46:53,270
the the words rather the,

3818
01:46:53,271 --> 01:46:54,104
the

3819
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:57,140
the one he did with his wife Bridgette.

3820
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:57,993
Neilson,

3821
01:46:58,050 --> 01:46:58,883
go ahead.

3822
01:46:59,190 --> 01:47:00,510
I don't shop you anyway.

3823
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:02,550
It was that Cobra Cobra.

3824
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:03,570
Oh he's fucking,

3825
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:05,200
he had the craziest car.

3826
01:47:05,201 --> 01:47:06,600
This guy again,

3827
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,020
I would have Dev,

3828
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:10,650
the oldest guy you could get,

3829
01:47:10,651 --> 01:47:12,090
it's got to have glass.

3830
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:13,590
You're going to be an old car.

3831
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:18,240
He had this old shit box car and he's
like racing people that are in like modern

3832
01:47:18,241 --> 01:47:21,240
cars catching them and we'll come on man.

3833
01:47:21,241 --> 01:47:23,700
I know he made his own fucking torpedoes.

3834
01:47:24,150 --> 01:47:25,650
He made good movies when he was young.

3835
01:47:25,651 --> 01:47:28,120
Fist was good to pull it out with a song.

3836
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:30,240
The lords of Flatbush and yeah,

3837
01:47:30,241 --> 01:47:31,074
that was his first.

3838
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,780
Henry Winkler put a ring.

3839
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,210
Let me go outside ladies.

3840
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:36,350
Let me pull up for this guy.

3841
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:36,840
You know,

3842
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:37,290
he talked,

3843
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:39,240
they got was the one
where he was the fighter,

3844
01:47:39,450 --> 01:47:40,290
not rocky.

3845
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:42,240
That was was looking at Stallone.

3846
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:43,051
He's,

3847
01:47:43,051 --> 01:47:44,700
he can act as fucking ass off.

3848
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:46,620
He just does a lot of shitty movies.

3849
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:50,520
They painted the one
with the arm wrestled.

3850
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:51,301
Oh,

3851
01:47:51,301 --> 01:47:53,550
I don't remember that
cause it's Kinda the top.

3852
01:47:53,551 --> 01:47:57,690
Was that what was the one when he
went to jail and he broke himself out?

3853
01:47:57,691 --> 01:47:57,811
What?

3854
01:47:57,811 --> 01:47:58,421
The car hit me.

3855
01:47:58,421 --> 01:47:59,520
The kid from King of Queens,

3856
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:01,890
they had the call and yeah,

3857
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:05,490
the Italian kid that used to hang out
with Kevin James and that there's a skinny

3858
01:48:05,491 --> 01:48:06,690
kid and that go look it up.

3859
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,220
He did a movie that came out.

3860
01:48:08,221 --> 01:48:09,210
I was in the halfway house.

3861
01:48:09,211 --> 01:48:10,880
91 90 what's the guy's name?

3862
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:11,910
I don't know,

3863
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:12,541
but it's the load.

3864
01:48:12,541 --> 01:48:14,780
That movie where he goes
to jail and then dad,

3865
01:48:14,781 --> 01:48:15,780
they work on a car.

3866
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:16,620
Okay.

3867
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:17,940
Remember they worked on a car.

3868
01:48:17,941 --> 01:48:21,600
The car was fast and it
brought him back and please,

3869
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:24,370
please look it up because I'm
not going to make it home.

3870
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:25,510
God brought me back.

3871
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:26,210
I had please,

3872
01:48:26,210 --> 01:48:26,610
I'm sorry.

3873
01:48:26,610 --> 01:48:27,480
What am I going to look up?

3874
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:28,480
What did I say?

3875
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:29,790
What did you even just say?

3876
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:35,490
Just go to fucking Sylvester Stallone
and look at 1990 and see what movie came

3877
01:48:35,491 --> 01:48:39,060
out and you could see everything we're
talking about what you put on my glasses.

3878
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:39,960
I can't do this.

3879
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:40,570
I can't.

3880
01:48:40,570 --> 01:48:43,860
I want to know what this fucking movie
is because you don't care enough to get

3881
01:48:43,861 --> 01:48:44,341
specific.

3882
01:48:44,341 --> 01:48:46,950
If you think that that
movie you think is bad,

3883
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:49,140
the one with karate with the kid,

3884
01:48:49,141 --> 01:48:49,920
the Bouncer,

3885
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,170
you got watch road house.

3886
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:52,470
This house is amazing.

3887
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,270
This is a roadhouse is bad.

3888
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:55,830
This is not bad.

3889
01:48:55,831 --> 01:48:57,000
Roadhouse is so bad.

3890
01:48:57,270 --> 01:48:57,990
It's good.

3891
01:48:57,990 --> 01:49:02,040
That's why Roadhouse roadhouses
my favorite hotel movie.

3892
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,950
If I'm flipping through the
channels out of respect,

3893
01:49:04,951 --> 01:49:05,940
if roadhouse comes on,

3894
01:49:05,941 --> 01:49:06,774
I keep it on.

3895
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:09,390
If I'm just flipping to the challenge
and any other movie comes on,

3896
01:49:09,391 --> 01:49:09,691
I'll,

3897
01:49:09,691 --> 01:49:10,860
I'll see what else is on.

3898
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:12,240
I'll keep changing much.

3899
01:49:12,241 --> 01:49:12,601
Listen,

3900
01:49:12,601 --> 01:49:17,601
but that day is the worst movie that
you leave on because it's so bad when he

3901
01:49:18,001 --> 01:49:19,020
takes the wire,

3902
01:49:19,230 --> 01:49:21,630
when he thinks the guy's intestines
and he flies out the door.

3903
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:22,021
First of all,

3904
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:22,860
why would you watch that?

3905
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:26,940
Because I'm high and I can't find the
remote and the hotel room lock I like,

3906
01:49:26,941 --> 01:49:28,320
I like a lot of friends that are Mexican,

3907
01:49:28,321 --> 01:49:30,820
so I got a one 80 lockup lockup.

3908
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:31,733
Thank you.

3909
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:34,770
He works on the car and
then the warden tells him,

3910
01:49:34,771 --> 01:49:35,820
if you fix the car,

3911
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,770
I'm going to shut your pro parole off.

3912
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:39,840
So he has to beat up the award.

3913
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:42,690
It's like the longest because trust me,

3914
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:46,710
I tried to watch the new Ari and I tried
to watch the new Sherlock Holmes movie

3915
01:49:47,230 --> 01:49:47,771
and we're like,

3916
01:49:47,771 --> 01:49:47,980
what

3917
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,120
the fuck is this?

3918
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:50,530
What did they do?

3919
01:49:50,531 --> 01:49:50,940
They do.

3920
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:52,420
They just put this together in a week.

3921
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:52,781
It's just,

3922
01:49:52,781 --> 01:49:53,400
it was,

3923
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:55,570
it was like so clunky,

3924
01:49:55,571 --> 01:49:57,220
like the was clunky.

3925
01:49:57,221 --> 01:50:02,221
The dialogue was like these
characters that that was cool.

3926
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:03,370
If it was a book,

3927
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:04,001
you know,

3928
01:50:04,001 --> 01:50:04,900
back in the old days,

3929
01:50:04,901 --> 01:50:05,531
but now it's like,

3930
01:50:05,531 --> 01:50:05,771
Hey,

3931
01:50:05,771 --> 01:50:07,130
do you want to see what
we need with hardy boy?

3932
01:50:07,450 --> 01:50:08,320
You know what it is,

3933
01:50:08,321 --> 01:50:08,800
man.

3934
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:09,451
They fuck it.

3935
01:50:09,451 --> 01:50:11,230
Do you have a Guy Robert Downey jr?

3936
01:50:11,231 --> 01:50:11,921
They got it right.

3937
01:50:11,921 --> 01:50:12,550
The first one.

3938
01:50:12,550 --> 01:50:14,350
I thought the first Sherlock
Holmes movie was good,

3939
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:14,951
but this,

3940
01:50:14,951 --> 01:50:16,120
the latest one was like,

3941
01:50:16,121 --> 01:50:17,260
what are you doing?

3942
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:18,310
It's like a parody.

3943
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,250
It was not good that that,

3944
01:50:20,251 --> 01:50:24,420
that new movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger
or Bruce Willis expendables.

3945
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:25,930
It's going to be awesome.

3946
01:50:25,931 --> 01:50:26,620
You think so?

3947
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:27,453
Of course it is.

3948
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:29,860
If you want to go see that kind of movie,

3949
01:50:29,861 --> 01:50:30,620
it's going to be awesome.

3950
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:31,020
It looks hard.

3951
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:31,811
I never saw the first one.

3952
01:50:31,811 --> 01:50:32,980
You know what that is?

3953
01:50:32,981 --> 01:50:33,461
That's a,

3954
01:50:33,461 --> 01:50:36,130
that's like a champ driving a muscle car.

3955
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:38,350
Think it's just crazy to watch.

3956
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:39,820
I saw the preview and heart source.

3957
01:50:39,830 --> 01:50:40,090
Anyway,

3958
01:50:40,090 --> 01:50:41,650
it goes back and I'm like,

3959
01:50:41,651 --> 01:50:42,431
are you kidding me?

3960
01:50:42,431 --> 01:50:43,720
He's really fun course.

3961
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:44,621
He'll say that,

3962
01:50:44,621 --> 01:50:44,951
man.

3963
01:50:44,951 --> 01:50:47,620
If you're in the theater and he gets
out there and he locks and loads,

3964
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:48,820
he goes,

3965
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:49,570
I'm back.

3966
01:50:49,570 --> 01:50:50,403
You'll go.

3967
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:54,820
Especially if you were 14
you were thinking about that.

3968
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:56,440
If you were 14 you were back in Ohio,

3969
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:58,720
would you not go crazy for this moment?

3970
01:50:58,721 --> 01:50:59,051
I'd be like,

3971
01:50:59,051 --> 01:50:59,591
who the fuck is,

3972
01:50:59,591 --> 01:50:59,890
I don't know.

3973
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:00,221
Sort of saying,

3974
01:51:00,221 --> 01:51:01,240
I don't give a shit about this dude name.

3975
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:01,391
Oh,

3976
01:51:01,391 --> 01:51:03,640
he's in a shitty movie I
saw on Hbo that one time.

3977
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:04,060
No,

3978
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:05,120
you know like kids,

3979
01:51:05,670 --> 01:51:07,240
if you watch terminator right now,

3980
01:51:07,241 --> 01:51:07,721
you're like,

3981
01:51:07,721 --> 01:51:08,440
who cares?

3982
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:09,700
But they got transformers,

3983
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,590
Arnold's Schwartzenegger
and we think it's good,

3984
01:51:14,591 --> 01:51:15,424
but I

3985
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:18,640
will not think that's good.

3986
01:51:18,770 --> 01:51:23,680
I watch superman the other day
and I watched Batman with uh,

3987
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:24,633
um,

3988
01:51:24,870 --> 01:51:25,250
uh,

3989
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:29,320
be returned Batman or whatever the one
with Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny Devito

3990
01:51:29,321 --> 01:51:30,190
as the joker.

3991
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,510
That was horrible.

3992
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:34,510
Almost awful to watch that.

3993
01:51:34,511 --> 01:51:35,291
Michael Douglas,

3994
01:51:35,291 --> 01:51:36,124
Michael Douglas,

3995
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:36,861
Michael,

3996
01:51:36,861 --> 01:51:37,121
Mikey,

3997
01:51:37,121 --> 01:51:39,040
keep make a case to think in my head.

3998
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:39,251
No,

3999
01:51:39,251 --> 01:51:40,450
Michael Keaton was the best bet.

4000
01:51:40,451 --> 01:51:40,581
I mean,

4001
01:51:40,581 --> 01:51:41,410
I like Michael Keaton.

4002
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:43,930
I watched off the biggest
pile of shit ever.

4003
01:51:43,931 --> 01:51:46,120
I can't believe I ever
thought that movie was good.

4004
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:47,500
And I watched superman.

4005
01:51:47,501 --> 01:51:47,950
I was like,

4006
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:51,220
this is the dumbest
cheesiest fucking movie ever.

4007
01:51:51,330 --> 01:51:54,040
It's your prime to one of them.

4008
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:55,060
Three or four,

4009
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:55,770
I think it was,

4010
01:51:55,770 --> 01:51:56,280
but superman,

4011
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:58,090
like here's like a part was like prior,

4012
01:51:58,150 --> 01:51:59,830
like this one girl,

4013
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:03,460
like Lois lane that he pushed over
the edge or something like that.

4014
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:07,180
And then he jumped over the edge
and then he went and got her,

4015
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:07,661
got her.

4016
01:52:07,661 --> 01:52:08,321
But then he's like,

4017
01:52:08,321 --> 01:52:12,400
they didn't explain like he was
Clark Kent or what's his name?

4018
01:52:12,710 --> 01:52:13,061
Character.

4019
01:52:13,061 --> 01:52:13,894
Clark Kent.

4020
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:15,520
He was Clark Clinton when he jumped off.

4021
01:52:15,521 --> 01:52:18,520
And then like he supposedly like changed
his clothes while he was falling and

4022
01:52:18,521 --> 01:52:21,130
then put his clothes somewhere
and then like grabbed her.

4023
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:24,460
It was like so many dumb things like
that superman is supposed to be able to

4024
01:52:24,461 --> 01:52:25,810
move faster than the speed of light.

4025
01:52:25,811 --> 01:52:27,010
So he could do that Brian now.

4026
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:29,380
But it was really horribly done.

4027
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:34,000
I'm sure greenscreen flying over and
you're just sitting there like this is so

4028
01:52:34,001 --> 01:52:34,834
fake.

4029
01:52:34,850 --> 01:52:36,590
I'm out of this movie cause your,

4030
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:38,680
your guys are obviously
not flying right now.

4031
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:39,910
It was that bad.

4032
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:40,421
So anyways,

4033
01:52:40,421 --> 01:52:42,340
you see a 13 year old
kid watched that movie.

4034
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:43,860
He's never going to get into that.

4035
01:52:44,470 --> 01:52:44,830
Yeah.

4036
01:52:44,830 --> 01:52:46,190
Well one thing that kids get

4037
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:49,030
today though that they never
got before is he get um,

4038
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:49,550
uh,

4039
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:52,640
a history of cinema like in a full form.

4040
01:52:52,641 --> 01:52:57,380
Like they get to see a vast difference
between like King Kong from the 1930s and

4041
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:58,310
a movie of today.

4042
01:52:58,340 --> 01:52:58,851
I mean it's a,

4043
01:52:58,851 --> 01:53:00,170
it's amazing if you watch,

4044
01:53:00,171 --> 01:53:03,620
if you're a kid today and you
watch like old movies that they,

4045
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:05,540
it's gotta be a real mind fuck.

4046
01:53:05,541 --> 01:53:08,180
Like how stupid were people
that they thought that was cool?

4047
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:11,870
We've seen it a little bit because I
remember when I was a kid growing up,

4048
01:53:11,871 --> 01:53:15,950
I was really into special effects
from monster movies and Harry housing.

4049
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:17,960
I think that's guys
Harrington was that the same,

4050
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:19,340
whatever the guy's name was.

4051
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:24,520
There was the animation dude who did
like King Kong and Rick Baker and we did

4052
01:53:24,561 --> 01:53:25,341
all the shit for,

4053
01:53:25,341 --> 01:53:25,790
um,

4054
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:28,550
he did an American Werewolf in
London and like really cool,

4055
01:53:28,551 --> 01:53:28,960
like,

4056
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:29,150
you know,

4057
01:53:29,150 --> 01:53:30,440
special effects type shit.

4058
01:53:30,530 --> 01:53:31,520
And I remember thinking like,

4059
01:53:31,521 --> 01:53:33,530
it's amazing like from the 1930s,

4060
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:34,790
the 1980s like,

4061
01:53:34,791 --> 01:53:37,970
look at how much better they've
gotten through the 1970s.

4062
01:53:37,971 --> 01:53:38,721
I remember thinking that.

4063
01:53:38,721 --> 01:53:38,871
Like,

4064
01:53:38,871 --> 01:53:39,051
wow,

4065
01:53:39,051 --> 01:53:41,180
they were terrible back
in those King Kong days.

4066
01:53:41,630 --> 01:53:44,810
But you look at it now
and through our lifetimes,

4067
01:53:44,811 --> 01:53:46,490
things have reached critical mass.

4068
01:53:46,491 --> 01:53:50,390
They've gotten really crazy to the
point where you're seeing an artificial,

4069
01:53:50,391 --> 01:53:51,380
like everything,

4070
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:53,300
like you're seeing asteroid impacts,

4071
01:53:53,301 --> 01:53:54,380
alien invasions,

4072
01:53:54,381 --> 01:53:57,230
all these different things in movies
that look incredibly realistic.

4073
01:53:57,740 --> 01:53:59,720
I mean incredibly realistic.

4074
01:53:59,810 --> 01:54:03,380
Like undiscernible like you don't
know what's fake and what's real.

4075
01:54:03,710 --> 01:54:06,140
I watched aliens the other night.

4076
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:07,820
It doesn't hold up.

4077
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:08,210
No,

4078
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:08,630
no,

4079
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:09,463
no.

4080
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:11,570
The suspense still holds up.

4081
01:54:11,571 --> 01:54:12,110
But the,

4082
01:54:12,110 --> 01:54:16,700
there's a scene where the
fucking spaceship is flying
through the clouds and it

4083
01:54:16,701 --> 01:54:18,020
looks so bad.

4084
01:54:18,021 --> 01:54:19,970
It looks like a Saturday
night live episode.

4085
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:21,400
It looks like two inches.

4086
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:24,190
The cat is driving the
spaceship and I missed tune.

4087
01:54:24,191 --> 01:54:26,420
Says it didn't even look remotely real.

4088
01:54:26,421 --> 01:54:26,751
I was like,

4089
01:54:26,751 --> 01:54:27,740
this is so fucking,

4090
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:29,780
it's so takes me out of this movie.

4091
01:54:29,950 --> 01:54:31,010
Like it's so clunky.

4092
01:54:31,190 --> 01:54:31,510
You know,

4093
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:36,510
the other night I went to do comedy and
I got home and as I walk in the fucking

4094
01:54:36,581 --> 01:54:36,941
door,

4095
01:54:36,941 --> 01:54:38,490
I sit down and to see who's on Letterman,

4096
01:54:38,491 --> 01:54:39,090
he was on level.

4097
01:54:39,090 --> 01:54:43,660
It's the first thing I do and something
I scrolled on Hbo and its midst and

4098
01:54:43,661 --> 01:54:44,494
majestic.

4099
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:48,730
Oh that's when they break Mr. That's
when they break Charles Bronson's water

4100
01:54:48,731 --> 01:54:49,480
balance.

4101
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:50,620
So I have a friend that's,

4102
01:54:50,730 --> 01:54:51,040
that's,

4103
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:53,320
I have a friend that's a
big Charles Bronson Fan.

4104
01:54:53,650 --> 01:54:54,101
I call him.

4105
01:54:54,101 --> 01:54:54,341
I go,

4106
01:54:54,341 --> 01:54:54,641
Bro,

4107
01:54:54,641 --> 01:54:56,890
it's 1230 here in California.

4108
01:54:57,310 --> 01:54:58,390
I was going to go to bed,

4109
01:54:58,391 --> 01:55:00,450
but I guess not Mr
Majestics only they look,

4110
01:55:00,610 --> 01:55:01,331
he's asleep.

4111
01:55:01,331 --> 01:55:02,164
He goes,

4112
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:02,650
dog,

4113
01:55:02,650 --> 01:55:03,520
what the fuck?

4114
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:04,331
He goes,

4115
01:55:04,331 --> 01:55:05,170
that's my favorite.

4116
01:55:05,171 --> 01:55:08,440
Charles Bronson is going to be killing
white people now call me in the morning.

4117
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:10,540
He just hangs up on me within,

4118
01:55:10,541 --> 01:55:11,230
I timed it.

4119
01:55:11,230 --> 01:55:14,020
He started beating up white
people at the 16 minute mark.

4120
01:55:14,530 --> 01:55:15,341
He's classic.

4121
01:55:15,341 --> 01:55:19,750
The first thing he did is he hit some
dude and the Dick with a shotgun in his

4122
01:55:19,751 --> 01:55:22,990
body and then the guy was playing music
on a speaker and he shot the fucking

4123
01:55:22,991 --> 01:55:25,270
speaker to get the Mexicans off the thing.

4124
01:55:25,450 --> 01:55:26,283
I fell asleep.

4125
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:27,910
It was too fucking slow again.

4126
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:31,210
That was one of those movie that was
great and 1980 I had to watch it,

4127
01:55:31,270 --> 01:55:34,420
but you watch it now and it's funny
cause when I first moved to Colorado and

4128
01:55:34,421 --> 01:55:35,254
aspirin,

4129
01:55:35,290 --> 01:55:39,310
they only had pay ESPN 12 one station
and it was just getting started.

4130
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:43,000
They played that movie three times a
week or it was a six o'clock movie.

4131
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:43,651
I watched it.

4132
01:55:43,651 --> 01:55:44,200
I was broke

4133
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:45,420
because I would watch every night.

4134
01:55:46,050 --> 01:55:48,090
So I know that movie front and back,

4135
01:55:48,091 --> 01:55:48,650
it's just,

4136
01:55:48,650 --> 01:55:49,290
you're right.

4137
01:55:49,290 --> 01:55:50,730
It's just hard times alone.

4138
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:51,541
Hard Times.

4139
01:55:51,541 --> 01:55:52,260
Death wish.

4140
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:52,861
The mechanic,

4141
01:55:52,861 --> 01:55:53,694
the mechanic,

4142
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:55,350
there was a couple movies he made.

4143
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:56,190
Uh,

4144
01:55:56,190 --> 01:55:59,970
you know that story I heard about when
they did the magnificent seven and they

4145
01:55:59,971 --> 01:56:01,050
all got together and they said,

4146
01:56:01,051 --> 01:56:01,620
listen,

4147
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:04,770
we can't let this fucking Yule
Brenner steal off fucking heat.

4148
01:56:04,771 --> 01:56:05,604
We're Americans.

4149
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:06,810
This guy's the fucking,

4150
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:07,601
well what we do,

4151
01:56:07,601 --> 01:56:08,610
they make the king and I.

4152
01:56:08,730 --> 01:56:09,210
Yeah.

4153
01:56:09,210 --> 01:56:09,691
And they were like,

4154
01:56:09,691 --> 01:56:10,291
are you kidding me?

4155
01:56:10,291 --> 01:56:11,310
Where's Yule Brenner from?

4156
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,170
You'll Brendan's life
from some other country.

4157
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:15,690
So this was an American movie and it was,

4158
01:56:15,691 --> 01:56:16,021
you know,

4159
01:56:16,021 --> 01:56:17,800
Steve McQueen and James Coburn,

4160
01:56:17,801 --> 01:56:18,690
Charles Bronson,

4161
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:19,351
and they're like,

4162
01:56:19,351 --> 01:56:20,080
let's torture this.

4163
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:22,130
Motherfuck so they would torture,

4164
01:56:22,230 --> 01:56:22,501
you know,

4165
01:56:22,501 --> 01:56:23,670
they would fucking abuse them.

4166
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:27,140
Call them up from the Formosa and tried
to wake him up in the middle of the

4167
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:27,150
night.

4168
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:28,930
We'll come in and get you
to hang up on him and shit.

4169
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:29,641
Yeah,

4170
01:56:29,641 --> 01:56:29,911
man,

4171
01:56:29,911 --> 01:56:30,810
they got the gun.

4172
01:56:30,811 --> 01:56:31,644
They're like dog,

4173
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:35,220
there's no way this motherfucker's gonna
come over and steal his movie from us.

4174
01:56:35,810 --> 01:56:37,050
So they were fucking with him really?

4175
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:38,490
Which I heard it.

4176
01:56:38,491 --> 01:56:39,001
I heard them.

4177
01:56:39,001 --> 01:56:40,350
I heard them talking about on TV.

4178
01:56:40,351 --> 01:56:42,420
That would sound the a biography one time.

4179
01:56:43,210 --> 01:56:43,441
You know,

4180
01:56:43,441 --> 01:56:43,740
they,

4181
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:45,810
they didn't enjoy and
see Scott insinuated it.

4182
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:46,391
George,

4183
01:56:46,391 --> 01:56:47,670
he's got one old and he's like dude,

4184

foreign to steal your movie.

4185
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,580
Fuck this motherfucker George,

4186
01:56:51,590 --> 01:56:52,200

4188
01:56:52,801 --> 01:56:52,950
You know,

4189
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:53,670

4190
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:54,503
he was the lit.

4191
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:55,060
He,

4192
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:55,380
he's,

4193
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:56,280
he was in the hustler.

4194
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:56,820
Right?

4195
01:56:56,820 --> 01:56:57,361
It wasn't George.

4196
01:56:57,361 --> 01:56:58,194
She's gotten the hustler.

4197
01:56:58,260 --> 01:56:58,651
No,

4198
01:56:58,651 --> 01:57:01,470
he's in the one about
cards with Steve McQueen.

4199
01:57:01,471 --> 01:57:02,400
The Cincinnati Kid.

4200
01:57:02,430 --> 01:57:02,880
Look up,

4201
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:03,571
look up the hustle.

4202
01:57:03,571 --> 01:57:04,404
I think he is.

4203
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:04,681
Yeah.

4204
01:57:04,681 --> 01:57:06,180
He always played in those heavy mood.

4205
01:57:06,490 --> 01:57:07,300
He was,

4206
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:07,640
no,

4207
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:08,870
he was always a heavy in those.

4208
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:09,570
Sure.

4209
01:57:09,570 --> 01:57:09,731
Yeah.

4210
01:57:09,731 --> 01:57:10,564
Cause he was,

4211
01:57:10,830 --> 01:57:11,370

4212
01:57:11,370 --> 01:57:15,930
He was always a heavy in those fucking
unleash Jackie Gleason cause he was in,

4213
01:57:15,931 --> 01:57:16,764
um,

4214
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:18,750
he was a friend of mine's brother,

4215
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,130
like brother-in-law or
something like that.

4216
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:24,900
Have you seen that at trailer for the
new Superman Nydia called man of steel.

4217
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:29,360
There's a new superman movie

4236
01:57:52,681 --> 01:57:54,180
See Scott played beat up Gore George.

4237
01:57:54,181 --> 01:57:55,290
These questions at the hustling,

4238
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:56,281
he played a heavy,

4239
01:57:56,281 --> 01:57:56,440
you know,

4240
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:57,720
you owe me money.

4241
01:57:58,130 --> 01:57:59,550
He was always a fucking heavy.

4242
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:01,170
He was craving that movie.

4243
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:01,951
Don't another movie,

4244
01:58:01,951 --> 01:58:02,530
the Hustler,

4245
01:58:02,530 --> 01:58:03,151
19 minutes.

4246
01:58:03,151 --> 01:58:03,271
It's,

4247
01:58:03,271 --> 01:58:05,310
I think it was 63 or some shit like that.

4248
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:07,320
And that's another movie that was a,

4249
01:58:07,321 --> 01:58:08,040
it's a,

4250
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:10,890
it's like you gotta like really have
an attention span and watch that movie.

4251
01:58:10,891 --> 01:58:12,210
It's a different sort of thing.

4252
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:14,310
There was a lot of subtlety back then.

4253
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:17,970
Like a guy would like walk in and like
look at the clock and then look at a guy

4254
01:58:17,971 --> 01:58:21,030
who worked there and the guy worked
there would go over and change the clock.

4255
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:21,990
They wouldn't say a word.

4256
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:23,040
The guy would look at him.

4257
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:24,660
Jackie Gleason looks at his watch,

4258
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:25,613
looks at him,

4259
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:26,790
and the guy just changes the clock.

4260
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:27,241
You know what I mean?

4261
01:58:27,241 --> 01:58:29,820
It's like there was like
subtlety to two movies back then.

4262
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:30,001
Well,

4263
01:58:30,001 --> 01:58:31,350
they gave you a magic nation,

4264
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:36,270
a director in the sixties seventies and
the beginning of the eighties he gave

4265
01:58:36,271 --> 01:58:37,104
you,

4266
01:58:37,580 --> 01:58:39,270
he let your mind run away with it,

4267
01:58:39,510 --> 01:58:39,781
you know,

4268
01:58:39,781 --> 01:58:43,290
and I always say that scene in the of
Marlon Brando goes down to director,

4269
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:45,280
would have showed him this director,

4270
01:58:45,281 --> 01:58:49,480
pulled it back and let the wind blow and
he showed the fucking things from the

4271
01:58:49,481 --> 01:58:50,740
fruit checking.

4272
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:52,690
They didn't show Marlon
Brando and the beauty of us,

4273
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,700
he didn't shoot Marlon Brando straight.

4274
01:58:54,701 --> 01:58:55,630
He shot it this way.

4275
01:58:55,990 --> 01:58:58,600
So Marlon Brando was dead
somewhere in that corner.

4276
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:00,040
That's your imagination.

4277
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:01,540
You're already judging like,

4278
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:02,374
where is he?

4279
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:03,580
He just died of a heart attack.

4280
01:59:03,581 --> 01:59:03,941
Where is it?

4281
01:59:03,941 --> 01:59:04,630
You're trying to look.

4282
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:05,530
He didn't give it to you.

4283
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:06,551
That was artistic.

4284
01:59:06,551 --> 01:59:07,301
That was artistic.

4285
01:59:07,301 --> 01:59:08,134
It was a different,

4286
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:08,321
you know,

4287
01:59:08,321 --> 01:59:12,640
that guy's a great fucking director and
today we have a few couple of directors

4288
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:15,190
but not that show you
that imagination bro.

4289
01:59:15,191 --> 01:59:16,270
When you leave there fluctuate,

4290
01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:17,123
you had a little bit.

4291
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:17,501
What's that?

4292
01:59:17,501 --> 01:59:20,500
What's going on now too is that there's
so much money involved and making a

4293
01:59:20,501 --> 01:59:24,100
movie and there's so many different
people involved in like their opinions and

4294
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:24,581
they,

4295
01:59:24,581 --> 01:59:28,120
you know when you get a hundred million
dollar investment in some crazy ass

4296
01:59:28,121 --> 01:59:28,331
move,

4297
01:59:28,331 --> 01:59:28,810
you got to,

4298
01:59:28,810 --> 01:59:29,980
unless you're James Cameron,

4299
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:31,090
we could just run the show.

4300
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:32,570
You know like a guy like you.

4301
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:33,210
Like everybody goes,

4302
01:59:33,210 --> 01:59:34,120
Oh James Cameron,

4303
01:59:34,121 --> 01:59:35,470
he's a thug and tells
everybody what to do.

4304
01:59:35,471 --> 01:59:36,304
He's an asshole.

4305
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:37,300
That's what he has to do.

4306
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:38,980
This is the only one
way to make a titanic.

4307
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:42,110
You have to have one guy who is powerful
as fuck with a crazy vision because

4308
01:59:42,111 --> 01:59:43,120
otherwise you're going to butcher it.

4309
01:59:43,450 --> 01:59:44,830
You know you're not
going to make an Avatar.

4310
01:59:44,831 --> 01:59:47,860
You've got to have one guy who puts
this whole fucking wacky thing together.

4311
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:49,540
The expendables is art.

4312
01:59:50,410 --> 01:59:50,800
No,

4313
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:51,850
it's a marketing boy.

4314
01:59:52,090 --> 01:59:52,361
Well,

4315
01:59:52,361 --> 01:59:54,510
it's fucking guys took a pay cut.

4316
01:59:54,511 --> 01:59:57,160
They're going to make 200 fucking million
and going to get a backup and they all

4317
01:59:57,161 --> 01:59:58,390
find a lot of say that,

4318
01:59:58,391 --> 02:00:01,480
but it is our children's roadhouse.

4319
02:00:01,690 --> 02:00:05,950
That's what it is with this stupid ass
movie is going to be all these movies

4320
02:00:05,951 --> 02:00:07,630
that are like really fun and ridiculous,

4321
02:00:07,870 --> 02:00:08,950
even though they're pointless.

4322
02:00:09,130 --> 02:00:11,980
They're going to be a little
funny shit that our kids laugh at.

4323
02:00:11,981 --> 02:00:12,910
Like how stupid is this?

4324
02:00:12,911 --> 02:00:13,330
It's like,

4325
02:00:13,330 --> 02:00:14,680
have you ever watched missing in action?

4326
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:15,940
I'll praise be to chuck Norris.

4327
02:00:16,150 --> 02:00:17,380
You ever watched missing in action?

4328
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,180
So there's a guy that I'm horrible movies,

4329
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:20,260
but they're awesome.

4330
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:22,200
They're awesome and they're
horribleness charge.

4331
02:00:22,450 --> 02:00:23,283
Let me tell you something.

4332
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:24,251
All respect.

4333
02:00:24,251 --> 02:00:27,670
The fucking homie made some
good movies with Chuck Norris.

4334
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:28,390
Chuck Marohn,

4335
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:29,000
nars mates.

4336
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:29,770
What?

4337
02:00:29,770 --> 02:00:31,450
What was that one cop
movie that he made was,

4338
02:00:31,451 --> 02:00:33,310
that was super little shit in Chicago.

4339
02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:35,160
Loophole that up.

4340
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:35,680
Yes.

4341
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:36,513
We've that other dude.

4342
02:00:37,610 --> 02:00:37,900
Yeah.

4343
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:38,371
Yeah.

4344
02:00:38,371 --> 02:00:42,050
When he 83 code salads,

4345
02:00:42,130 --> 02:00:42,963
code of Silence,

4346
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:44,520
budget movie.

4347
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:48,070
He was a bad mother fucker in that movie.

4348
02:00:48,071 --> 02:00:50,810
I'll put his performance in
that movie up with anybody.

4349
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:53,290
I play in a legit guy,

4350
02:00:53,291 --> 02:00:54,960
but he had to martial arts before that.

4351
02:00:55,130 --> 02:00:57,340
Barely even use much karate in that movie.

4352
02:00:57,640 --> 02:00:57,980
He like,

4353
02:00:57,980 --> 02:00:59,600
he had a kick a couple of ask it.

4354
02:00:59,660 --> 02:01:00,520
That was a real movement.

4355
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:01,211
The Pool Hall,

4356
02:01:01,211 --> 02:01:03,890
he's the first guy ever
before Steven Seagal,

4357
02:01:03,950 --> 02:01:07,770
that movie that he put the cool boy and
the thing and started hitting people

4358
02:01:07,771 --> 02:01:08,050
with it.

4359
02:01:08,050 --> 02:01:11,140
Really us the Gao stolen out for justice.

4360
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:11,801
We know.

4361
02:01:11,801 --> 02:01:13,600
Where's Bobby Lupo later on,

4362
02:01:13,810 --> 02:01:14,561
but double check,

4363
02:01:14,561 --> 02:01:16,670
but please tell me the
name of Chuck Norris,

4364
02:01:16,671 --> 02:01:17,590
his earlier movies.

4365
02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:21,010
This is code of silence was
in 85 85 that was a good move.

4366
02:01:21,011 --> 02:01:21,581
What's before?

4367
02:01:21,581 --> 02:01:23,980
Coatis army invasion USA.

4368
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:25,960
That's Delta force garbage.

4369
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:26,621
Oh,

4370
02:01:26,621 --> 02:01:27,700
actually those are after it.

4371
02:01:27,730 --> 02:01:28,421
Before that,

4372
02:01:28,421 --> 02:01:28,690
I'm sorry.

4373
02:01:28,690 --> 02:01:28,841
Oh,

4374
02:01:28,841 --> 02:01:29,860
won't lone wolf.

4375
02:01:29,861 --> 02:01:34,390
Mclass at what's before what lone wolf
McQuade was still a karate movie because

4376
02:01:34,391 --> 02:01:36,190
that was David Carradine and,

4377
02:01:36,191 --> 02:01:39,980
and Chuck Norris would go out and
at the end and the fucking ultimate

4378
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:42,770
finale karate scene that you knew Chuck
Norris is going to win because it's his

4379
02:01:42,771 --> 02:01:43,830
movie now.

4380
02:01:44,290 --> 02:01:46,020
There was no drama in that victory.

4381
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:46,731
Oh,

4382
02:01:46,731 --> 02:01:47,301
there's a bunch.

4383
02:01:47,301 --> 02:01:48,860
Man is forced vengeance,

4384
02:01:48,861 --> 02:01:50,870
silent rage and eye for an eye.

4385
02:01:51,290 --> 02:01:52,280
The octagon.

4386
02:01:52,281 --> 02:01:54,450
That's a go walk to gun before the game.

4387
02:01:55,310 --> 02:01:57,680
What about this 1980 a force of one.

4388
02:01:57,681 --> 02:01:58,281
That was a good one.

4389
02:01:58,281 --> 02:01:59,031
That was a go one.

4390
02:01:59,031 --> 02:02:00,200
And what's the good guys wear?

4391
02:02:00,201 --> 02:02:01,034
Black.

4392
02:02:02,320 --> 02:02:03,560
That was a good one.

4393
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:07,340
Fuck some people up in the
beginning and then way back,

4394
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:12,140
the first movie ever had was 68 the
green berets and the wrecking crew,

4395
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,150
he was like a party guest who was like,

4396
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:15,770
had to let tiny ass role.

4397
02:02:15,950 --> 02:02:20,950
And then in 72 he was in the way
of the dragon pitches and that's a,

4398
02:02:21,421 --> 02:02:21,981
that was it.

4399
02:02:21,981 --> 02:02:23,830
That launched him say giving broke.

4400
02:02:23,831 --> 02:02:24,664
He had,

4401
02:02:24,860 --> 02:02:27,170
he had more longevity cause to gout.

4402
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:29,870
You tap that on the Gal
after the Brooklyn movie.

4403
02:02:30,290 --> 02:02:31,880
Once somebody shot Bobby
looper you're like,

4404
02:02:31,881 --> 02:02:32,750
I'm not putting up with this.

4405
02:02:32,751 --> 02:02:32,980
Fuck.

4406
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:33,411
It's good.

4407
02:02:33,411 --> 02:02:34,300
Guys were blacked.

4408
02:02:34,301 --> 02:02:37,610
It really launched the guys
good looking at his career.

4409
02:02:37,611 --> 02:02:39,980
There's like a couple of
years we didn't do any movies.

4410
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:45,070
He had 72 73 74 and then 75
76 seven and seven s so for,

4411
02:02:46,930 --> 02:02:49,190
for between 75 and 77 he didn't work.

4412
02:02:49,191 --> 02:02:50,220
And then he did break a breaker.

4413
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:51,920
No,

4414
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:52,071
no,

4415
02:02:52,071 --> 02:02:52,221
no.

4416
02:02:52,221 --> 02:02:53,740
That's when he sold tanks.

4417
02:02:53,741 --> 02:02:54,141
Trudeau.

4418
02:02:54,141 --> 02:02:57,530
And why was he fighting before 72 really?

4419
02:02:57,740 --> 02:02:58,041
Yeah.

4420
02:02:58,041 --> 02:02:58,874
Look it up.

4421
02:02:59,830 --> 02:03:01,220
Let me tell you something
about Chuck Norris.

4422
02:03:01,221 --> 02:03:01,371
You know,

4423
02:03:01,371 --> 02:03:02,780
people joke around about Chuck Norris.

4424
02:03:02,781 --> 02:03:07,781
Chuck Norris back in his day was a bad
mother fucking body and fun where the

4425
02:03:07,821 --> 02:03:08,654
Dragon,

4426
02:03:08,890 --> 02:03:09,980
he was allergic shit,

4427
02:03:09,981 --> 02:03:11,260
bad motherfucker back then.

4428
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:15,200
I mean the level of a
martial arts back then,

4429
02:03:15,250 --> 02:03:15,590
you know,

4430
02:03:15,590 --> 02:03:19,730
there was a few guys that
were representing at the
top level of martial arts.

4431
02:03:19,730 --> 02:03:20,241
He was one of them,

4432
02:03:20,241 --> 02:03:21,110
Benny or key does.

4433
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:22,213
He was one of them.

4434
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:26,000
There was a few of those guys back
then and Chuck Norris was is legit.

4435
02:03:26,570 --> 02:03:27,201
I see Benny,

4436
02:03:27,201 --> 02:03:28,034
I get happy.

4437
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:28,770
He's a great guy.

4438
02:03:28,770 --> 02:03:29,780
We thought when I see Benny,

4439
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:30,471
I get happy.

4440
02:03:30,471 --> 02:03:32,210
I got to tell you that if
you mentioned the bell yet.

4441
02:03:32,870 --> 02:03:33,150
No,

4442
02:03:33,150 --> 02:03:33,471
but he's,

4443
02:03:33,471 --> 02:03:34,350
Jim is one of those.

4444
02:03:35,390 --> 02:03:38,030
But you see at the gym every day
and let them get you in a headlock.

4445
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:38,600
No.

4446
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:39,620
Is He at the gym every day?

4447
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:40,251
I don't know.

4448
02:03:40,251 --> 02:03:41,000
I don't know a schedule.

4449
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:41,511
By the way.

4450
02:03:41,511 --> 02:03:44,630
I stopped by at each school last
night and I got to tell you something.

4451
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:47,540
Ronda Rousey's very fucking Straw.

4452
02:03:47,630 --> 02:03:47,811
Oh,

4453
02:03:47,811 --> 02:03:48,531
she's a beast,

4454
02:03:48,531 --> 02:03:49,010
man.

4455
02:03:49,010 --> 02:03:49,910
She's very fun.

4456
02:03:49,930 --> 02:03:50,521
It shouldn't happen,

4457
02:03:50,521 --> 02:03:51,050
dude.

4458
02:03:51,050 --> 02:03:51,960
I was watching her.

4459
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:52,490
He,

4460
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:52,911
first of all,

4461
02:03:52,911 --> 02:03:54,950
he was teaching some high
level shit last night.

4462
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,780
He was on a row last night.

4463
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:57,471
I went yesterday,

4464
02:03:57,471 --> 02:03:58,880
the day time and last night.

4465
02:03:58,900 --> 02:03:59,440
Yeah,

4466
02:03:59,440 --> 02:03:59,780
he was.

4467
02:03:59,780 --> 02:04:00,800
He's been on a roll lately.

4468
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:01,730
He's been on the road,

4469
02:04:01,730 --> 02:04:05,960
but last night he was teaching some high
level shit dark and when she packs that

4470
02:04:05,961 --> 02:04:06,794
food over,

4471
02:04:07,770 --> 02:04:08,030
oh,

4472
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:09,050
she was powerful legs.

4473
02:04:09,051 --> 02:04:09,884
Mindful Lady.

4474
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:10,450
Great.

4475
02:04:10,450 --> 02:04:12,320
Armando hormones are nasty man.

4476
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:14,060
She's a strong woman.

4477
02:04:14,061 --> 02:04:14,411
Gosh,

4478
02:04:14,411 --> 02:04:15,470
she gets a hold of your arm.

4479
02:04:15,490 --> 02:04:16,020
She,

4480
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:16,853
she knows,

4481
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:19,250
she doesn't just know
how to get an arm bar.

4482
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:21,740
She knows how to correct
as you're correcting.

4483
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:22,480
So she knows,

4484
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:23,540
she knows to anticipate,

4485
02:04:23,710 --> 02:04:24,920
like here for instance,

4486
02:04:24,921 --> 02:04:26,780
like this is the way to
get a person in an arm bar.

4487
02:04:26,781 --> 02:04:28,160
You got to extend their arm like that.

4488
02:04:28,190 --> 02:04:30,590
So if you think that someone's
going to try to arm bar you,

4489
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:32,660
the first thing you do is
turn your hand this way.

4490
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:35,780
And the reason why you turn your hand
this way is because then you straighten it

4491
02:04:35,781 --> 02:04:36,021
out.

4492
02:04:36,021 --> 02:04:37,830
You force it like to what they want.

4493
02:04:37,831 --> 02:04:38,070
They want

4494
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,830
to straighten your arm out so you turn
it like that and then go like this.

4495
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:43,320
So that way when they pull on the arm,

4496
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:46,740
it's going to go with the joint and it's
going to bend and then that's their job

4497
02:04:46,741 --> 02:04:47,880
to try to turn it back around.

4498
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:53,360
She's a master at adjusting that armbar
like making sure that once she locks

4499
02:04:53,941 --> 02:04:54,001
her,

4500
02:04:54,001 --> 02:04:54,690
hold that arm,

4501
02:04:54,690 --> 02:04:56,070
she rolls with them.

4502
02:04:56,071 --> 02:04:57,060
She flipped some.

4503
02:04:57,061 --> 02:04:57,721
She's like,

4504
02:04:57,721 --> 02:04:59,550
if you watch her fight with Misha Tate,

4505
02:04:59,551 --> 02:05:01,590
or if you watch a lot of our
victories when one of the girls,

4506
02:05:01,591 --> 02:05:04,770
he dislocated her arm and the girl
said she didn't tap it or is Jack,

4507
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:05,020
she,

4508
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:06,670
Jack's everybody's arms and she,

4509
02:05:06,671 --> 02:05:08,940
she is a master at adjusting.

4510
02:05:08,941 --> 02:05:10,320
As soon as she locks that thing up,

4511
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:10,921
first of all,

4512
02:05:10,921 --> 02:05:13,200
the speed that she locks
it up as nasty as fuck.

4513
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:15,030
Her technique is pinpoint,

4514
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:18,300
everything's perfect and
she's a master at adjusting.

4515
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:18,710
So there's,

4516
02:05:18,710 --> 02:05:20,100
once she grabs a hold that arm,

4517
02:05:20,101 --> 02:05:21,150
you start flopping around,

4518
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:22,770
but she knows where you're going to go.

4519
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:23,610
You know why?

4520
02:05:23,610 --> 02:05:26,370
Because she puts on bars on people
every fucking day of the week,

4521
02:05:26,490 --> 02:05:27,990
so she knows exactly what to do.

4522
02:05:28,110 --> 02:05:31,140
There's certain positions
that when you get used to,

4523
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:33,360
you know how a guy can get out of him,

4524
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:34,380
you know the defense.

4525
02:05:34,381 --> 02:05:37,320
Like if you first learned a rear naked
choke and you've never choke the guy

4526
02:05:37,321 --> 02:05:38,130
before,

4527
02:05:38,130 --> 02:05:40,920
the guy gets a hand on a 10 he turns
the next thing you know he's out and you

4528
02:05:40,921 --> 02:05:41,760
don't even know what happened.

4529
02:05:42,030 --> 02:05:43,260
But if you get good at it,

4530
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:45,270
you know what a guy can do to get out.

4531
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:49,770
And so you stop all that shit from you
anticipate it and the more you roll,

4532
02:05:49,771 --> 02:05:50,900
the more mat time to get in.

4533
02:05:50,901 --> 02:05:51,750
The more reps you get,

4534
02:05:51,751 --> 02:05:53,960
the more time you spend
actually choking people,

4535
02:05:53,961 --> 02:05:54,900
the better you get at that.

4536
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:56,010
It's just no way around it.

4537
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:58,620
Or Rhonda has got to that point,

4538
02:05:58,621 --> 02:05:59,730
that master point.

4539
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:00,110
You know,

4540
02:06:00,110 --> 02:06:02,190
there's a point that someone
gets to a certain moves,

4541
02:06:02,191 --> 02:06:04,090
like with Cody Mackenzie's
that crazy guillotine.

4542
02:06:04,091 --> 02:06:05,880
Tina gets people with Rhonda.

4543
02:06:05,881 --> 02:06:07,320
It's that nutty armbar man.

4544
02:06:07,321 --> 02:06:10,200
And she's got a lot of other
techniques and her defense is good too.

4545
02:06:10,201 --> 02:06:13,860
Cause Misha Tate is also
a bad motherfucker and me
should take out her back and

4546
02:06:13,861 --> 02:06:14,760
she got out of that,

4547
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:15,230
you know,

4548
02:06:15,230 --> 02:06:17,190
shows you that her
defense is good as well.

4549
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:17,641
But,

4550
02:06:17,641 --> 02:06:18,100
uh,

4551
02:06:18,100 --> 02:06:19,220
we should say five next.

4552
02:06:20,140 --> 02:06:20,461
Let me see.

4553
02:06:20,461 --> 02:06:21,670
I think so nimble.

4554
02:06:21,830 --> 02:06:22,230
Um,

4555
02:06:22,230 --> 02:06:23,610
Ron is fighting Sarah Kaufman,

4556
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,460
so I love Misha tape,

4557
02:06:25,461 --> 02:06:25,740
man.

4558
02:06:25,740 --> 02:06:26,760
I follow on Twitter.

4559
02:06:27,030 --> 02:06:27,900
I love women's fighting.

4560
02:06:27,901 --> 02:06:28,100
Man.

4561
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:29,610
I didn't use to love women's fighting.

4562
02:06:29,990 --> 02:06:31,320
It's to a different level.

4563
02:06:31,321 --> 02:06:31,561
Yeah,

4564
02:06:31,561 --> 02:06:31,711
yeah,

4565
02:06:31,711 --> 02:06:32,544
yeah.

4566
02:06:32,730 --> 02:06:36,210
See what does her should
say next opponent?

4567
02:06:36,211 --> 02:06:41,211
Hold on as a great movie to watch his
fast night while smoking shit loads a

4568
02:06:41,721 --> 02:06:42,180
weed.

4569
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:45,150
It's the most trippiest fucked
up movie I've ever seen.

4570
02:06:45,151 --> 02:06:47,130
It's called a funky forest.

4571
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:47,341
Okay.

4572
02:06:47,341 --> 02:06:47,941
Hold on a second.

4573
02:06:47,941 --> 02:06:48,870
Cause I want to answer their question.

4574
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:50,520
Her name was Julie Kedsey.

4575
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:50,920
That's it.

4576
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:51,840
That's who she's fighting.

4577
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:53,110
She's Miesha Tate fight.

4578
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:55,440
Julie Kedsey and isn't a strike
force and it's an August.

4579
02:06:55,860 --> 02:06:57,660
They're fighting a August 18th.

4580
02:06:58,260 --> 02:06:58,711
Her uh,

4581
02:06:58,711 --> 02:07:00,720
her boyfriend just fought
in the UFC and one right?

4582
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:00,901
No,

4583
02:07:00,901 --> 02:07:02,380
me sharing CareWeb but what's,

4584
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:03,031
uh,

4585
02:07:03,031 --> 02:07:03,864
I'm sorry.

4586
02:07:04,950 --> 02:07:05,920
She's fighting a little show.

4587
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:06,540
Whoa.

4588
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:07,373
Ronda.

4589
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:09,870
Ronda Rousey's fight and
Sarah Kaufman that same night.

4590
02:07:10,130 --> 02:07:10,890
Is it same night?

4591
02:07:10,890 --> 02:07:11,041
Yeah.

4592
02:07:11,041 --> 02:07:11,820
Can you please check?

4593
02:07:11,820 --> 02:07:12,960
I think it's from August something.

4594
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:13,861
Um,

4595
02:07:13,861 --> 02:07:14,550
I don't think so.

4596
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:14,940
I think,

4597
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:15,571
I think uh,

4598
02:07:15,571 --> 02:07:16,830
Rhonda is funding another time.

4599
02:07:16,950 --> 02:07:19,640
So there's two different
strike force think.

4600
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:20,850
So I'm not sure.

4601
02:07:21,630 --> 02:07:22,351
I feel like,

4602
02:07:22,351 --> 02:07:22,830
uh,

4603
02:07:22,830 --> 02:07:24,570
Rhonda is fight is a,

4604
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:26,640
as next is a,

4605
02:07:26,650 --> 02:07:27,870
the next month I believe.

4606
02:07:27,871 --> 02:07:28,704
Let me check though.

4607
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:29,840
Ronda.

4608
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:30,673
Rosa.

4609
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:32,700
So what happened Brian?

4610
02:07:32,701 --> 02:07:32,940
You got,

4611
02:07:32,940 --> 02:07:33,773
Huh?

4612
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:35,660
I,

4613
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:36,280
there's a movie

4614
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:37,350
called funky forest,

4615
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:38,320
the first contact,

4616
02:07:38,321 --> 02:07:39,990
and it's a hilarious movie.

4617
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,470
You know,

4618
02:07:41,650 --> 02:07:44,800
it's just a great movie to watch when
you're super stoned around mushrooms.

4619
02:07:44,890 --> 02:07:45,630
It's the,

4620
02:07:45,630 --> 02:07:47,290
if you go on Google or on Youtube,

4621
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:49,540
you could watch clips of it and if you,

4622
02:07:49,541 --> 02:07:50,770
if I showed you it,

4623
02:07:50,771 --> 02:07:52,510
you would fucking freak the fuck out.

4624
02:07:52,550 --> 02:07:52,701
Oh,

4625
02:07:52,701 --> 02:07:52,991
okay.

4626
02:07:52,991 --> 02:07:55,910
This is August 18th it's
the same car I knew.

4627
02:07:56,070 --> 02:07:56,903
Wow,

4628
02:07:57,270 --> 02:07:58,120
that's crazy.

4629
02:07:58,390 --> 02:07:59,650
That means it's going to be too big.

4630
02:07:59,651 --> 02:08:00,910
Women's fights on one card.

4631
02:08:00,911 --> 02:08:01,870
I thought they would space it out.

4632
02:08:04,030 --> 02:08:04,211
Well,

4633
02:08:04,211 --> 02:08:04,691
you know what,

4634
02:08:04,691 --> 02:08:04,990
man,

4635
02:08:04,990 --> 02:08:06,070
the reality is,

4636
02:08:06,071 --> 02:08:10,960
Rhonda is such a Badass that there's been
a lot of attention on the women's MMA

4637
02:08:10,961 --> 02:08:14,770
movement now there where there wasn't
just a year or two ago when Gina Carano

4638
02:08:14,771 --> 02:08:17,350
stopped fighting when she
stepped out and Rhonda,

4639
02:08:17,351 --> 02:08:17,980
the other theaters,

4640
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:18,510
I Rhonda,

4641
02:08:18,510 --> 02:08:21,430
it's like stepped up to
Cyborg like a bunch of times.

4642
02:08:21,430 --> 02:08:22,263
So if you've never seen,

4643
02:08:22,430 --> 02:08:23,670
if you don't know what the
fuck we're talking about,

4644
02:08:23,690 --> 02:08:24,880
there's a woman named Cyborg.

4645
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:26,530
If you were a chick and you were fighting,

4646
02:08:26,650 --> 02:08:27,820
what would be your biggest nightmare?

4647
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:30,760
So your biggest night would be
a woman who's not attractive,

4648
02:08:30,761 --> 02:08:31,600
who looks like a man,

4649
02:08:31,601 --> 02:08:33,970
is built like a man and she
knows how to fuck people up.

4650
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:34,850
But I saying that,

4651
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:35,800
yeah,

4652
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:36,790
I don't want to go to Woolworths.

4653
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:39,170
And that's almost exactly what Cyborg is.

4654
02:08:39,171 --> 02:08:39,701
It's fuck.

4655
02:08:39,701 --> 02:08:43,850
And she tested positive for testosterone
and male hormones or whatever.

4656
02:08:43,890 --> 02:08:46,730
Whatever she had taken whatever
banned substance that she had taken.

4657
02:08:46,731 --> 02:08:47,500
It wasn't it?

4658
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:48,820
I think it was Anna Bar,

4659
02:08:48,910 --> 02:08:49,743
but I don't remember.

4660
02:08:49,870 --> 02:08:50,920
But whatever it was,

4661
02:08:50,921 --> 02:08:51,980
it's some sort of a,

4662
02:08:51,990 --> 02:08:52,171
a,

4663
02:08:52,171 --> 02:08:52,930
a steroid,

4664
02:08:52,930 --> 02:08:54,910
which is what everybody at
accused her of everywhere.

4665
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:55,481
Uh,

4666
02:08:55,481 --> 02:08:55,841
anyway,

4667
02:08:55,841 --> 02:08:57,040
so Ronda Rousey's center,

4668
02:08:57,041 --> 02:08:57,490
uh,

4669
02:08:57,490 --> 02:08:58,271
you have a Dick,

4670
02:08:58,271 --> 02:08:59,104
you dick,

4671
02:09:00,490 --> 02:09:01,300
she uh,

4672
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:05,500
she said a picture of Gina Carano
Cyborg did cause Ronda Rousey said that,

4673
02:09:05,550 --> 02:09:06,240
you know,

4674
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:07,390
you know that she was a cheater.

4675
02:09:07,450 --> 02:09:08,770
So she sent a picture of,

4676
02:09:08,771 --> 02:09:09,190
uh,

4677
02:09:09,190 --> 02:09:09,640
of uh,

4678
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:12,190
Gina Carano when their face
busted up after Cyborg,

4679
02:09:12,191 --> 02:09:13,750
beat her up and she said,

4680
02:09:13,751 --> 02:09:14,980
you have a deck you'd tick,

4681
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:17,440
which is pretty fucking funny.

4682
02:09:17,950 --> 02:09:18,783
And it was just,

4683
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:20,050
if you really think about it,

4684
02:09:20,051 --> 02:09:21,280
if she really wants cheating,

4685
02:09:21,281 --> 02:09:22,900
and that's what she did
once she was cheating.

4686
02:09:22,901 --> 02:09:23,860
Like if you really,

4687
02:09:23,861 --> 02:09:24,041
it was,

4688
02:09:24,041 --> 02:09:24,874
I mean if you,

4689
02:09:24,910 --> 02:09:26,050
it's really not that many.

4690
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:27,250
We talked about on the podcast,

4691
02:09:27,251 --> 02:09:30,010
we even had a doctor who had doctor
Steve Call up and explain it to us.

4692
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:33,430
Is it possible to look like that
without some sort of enhancement?

4693
02:09:33,431 --> 02:09:34,390
He doesn't believe it is.

4694
02:09:34,570 --> 02:09:37,570
He doesn't think it's physiologically
possible for a woman to be built like that

4695
02:09:37,571 --> 02:09:40,300
and less somewhere along the
lunch has been taken some shit.

4696
02:09:41,770 --> 02:09:43,870
Like if you look at those
really fit crossfit girls,

4697
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:45,580
those really in shape women,

4698
02:09:45,581 --> 02:09:46,930
they look fucking tremendous.

4699
02:09:47,230 --> 02:09:48,190
But they look like women,

4700
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:48,890
you know,

4701
02:09:48,890 --> 02:09:50,440
they have good arms and they have,

4702
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:50,741
you know,

4703
02:09:50,741 --> 02:09:53,350
they're thick and they have like
big legs and everything like that,

4704
02:09:53,351 --> 02:09:56,470
but they have a much more feminine
look to their musculature.

4705
02:09:57,010 --> 02:09:57,191
You know,

4706
02:09:57,191 --> 02:09:58,420
there's a certain level that,

4707
02:09:58,421 --> 02:09:58,690
uh,

4708
02:09:58,690 --> 02:10:00,130
that some women have gotten.

4709
02:10:00,490 --> 02:10:01,323
And you know,

4710
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:01,880
Cyborg.

4711
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:02,290
One of them.

4712
02:10:02,290 --> 02:10:04,290
What's the joke used to
do about the fucking,

4713
02:10:05,170 --> 02:10:07,850
the whole Noah's Ark was a retarded boy.

4714
02:10:08,150 --> 02:10:09,940
Oh boy,

4715
02:10:10,040 --> 02:10:12,520
look at a little bit on steroids and
tell you something ain't right there.

4716
02:10:12,610 --> 02:10:12,970
Yeah.

4717
02:10:12,970 --> 02:10:13,181
Okay.

4718
02:10:13,181 --> 02:10:13,830
You could see it.

4719
02:10:13,830 --> 02:10:14,111
So there's,

4720
02:10:14,111 --> 02:10:17,160
you see the neck and the
fucking jaw line and the,

4721
02:10:17,290 --> 02:10:17,561
I mean,

4722
02:10:17,561 --> 02:10:18,610
her upper body was,

4723
02:10:18,611 --> 02:10:20,680
I mean she had traps [inaudible] traps.

4724
02:10:20,681 --> 02:10:21,000
Can I go?

4725
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:21,610
Okay.

4726
02:10:21,610 --> 02:10:22,361
So I mean,

4727
02:10:22,361 --> 02:10:23,950
I understand what a woman burns.

4728
02:10:23,951 --> 02:10:25,910
Fat titties gets lost and it's,

4729
02:10:26,050 --> 02:10:28,030
but it's harder for a woman to have a,

4730
02:10:28,410 --> 02:10:31,600
a muscle definition because they have an
extra layer of fat and all that stuff.

4731
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:32,860
But you could,

4732
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:36,410
I'm no InQuicker phenologist and I
could tell that bitch did something.

4733
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:37,890
She did a lot more than to see it.

4734
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:38,590
Uh,

4735
02:10:38,590 --> 02:10:38,860
uh,

4736
02:10:38,860 --> 02:10:41,660
what is it that GNC
shake and a fucking weed.

4737
02:10:41,661 --> 02:10:42,050
A pill,

4738
02:10:42,050 --> 02:10:42,531
you know what I'm saying?

4739
02:10:42,531 --> 02:10:43,340
She did something,

4740
02:10:43,340 --> 02:10:43,491
well,

4741
02:10:43,491 --> 02:10:44,480
she could tooken this shit.

4742
02:10:44,481 --> 02:10:46,010
They used to be legal at GNC.

4743
02:10:46,070 --> 02:10:48,350
Like she could've gotten on some
mag 10 or something like that.

4744
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:49,470
Was that stuff strong?

4745
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:50,391
Oh yeah.

4746
02:10:50,391 --> 02:10:51,260
It was ridiculous.

4747
02:10:51,290 --> 02:10:51,951
GNC,

4748
02:10:51,951 --> 02:10:53,150
maybe they banned it.

4749
02:10:53,151 --> 02:10:54,020
They used to have it.

4750
02:10:54,021 --> 02:10:54,680
I took it.

4751
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:55,880
It's called Mag 10.

4752
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:56,690
I took it.

4753
02:10:56,690 --> 02:10:59,690
You took it easy word to the word.

4754
02:11:00,710 --> 02:11:01,550
If you were lifting weights,

4755
02:11:01,551 --> 02:11:06,551
you would notice if you like did it and
took it and lifted weights lifted for

4756
02:11:06,561 --> 02:11:07,430
other reasons.

4757
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:08,353
What otherwise is we?

4758
02:11:08,470 --> 02:11:09,201
I don't remember,

4759
02:11:09,201 --> 02:11:11,020
but maybe I did take it
when I was working on,

4760
02:11:11,030 --> 02:11:13,360
I don't want it to be yoked now.

4761
02:11:13,370 --> 02:11:15,260
Remember when you got really
doing anything to me off?

4762
02:11:15,290 --> 02:11:15,531
Yeah,

4763
02:11:15,531 --> 02:11:17,840
they got rid of it because
it was like a steroid.

4764
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:21,380
It's like taking a steroid and I'm not
saying you could get big without juicing,

4765
02:11:21,410 --> 02:11:23,300
but she was at the point where you knew,

4766
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:24,920
you knew something was going on.

4767
02:11:25,130 --> 02:11:27,960
Her face started looking
like very masculine too.

4768
02:11:27,970 --> 02:11:28,803
And what's really crazy.

4769
02:11:28,830 --> 02:11:31,160
It was a video of her
from her first fight ever.

4770
02:11:31,450 --> 02:11:32,660
And if you go back to
her first fight ever,

4771
02:11:32,661 --> 02:11:33,494
she looked like a woman.

4772
02:11:33,770 --> 02:11:35,000
She was built very differently.

4773
02:11:35,090 --> 02:11:36,290
If you look at it like she's,

4774
02:11:36,410 --> 02:11:36,801
she looks,

4775
02:11:36,801 --> 02:11:37,760
she's still bad ass.

4776
02:11:37,761 --> 02:11:39,050
She's still going to war with some checks.

4777
02:11:39,051 --> 02:11:39,771
She's thrown down,

4778
02:11:39,771 --> 02:11:40,910
she's a shoot box fighter,

4779
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:43,130
but she looks like a woman.

4780
02:11:43,131 --> 02:11:44,300
Her body looks like a woman.

4781
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:46,580
It's kind of shocking the
difference cause she looks,

4782
02:11:47,030 --> 02:11:48,050
she's scary now.

4783
02:11:48,170 --> 02:11:49,860
She looks like she would fuck with me.

4784
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:50,713
She come back.

4785
02:11:50,890 --> 02:11:51,723
I don't know.

4786
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:52,820
She might not ever come back.

4787
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:53,510
Who knows?

4788
02:11:53,510 --> 02:11:53,850
You know?

4789
02:11:53,850 --> 02:11:54,683
I Dunno.

4790
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:54,921
Yeah.

4791
02:11:54,921 --> 02:11:55,551
She'll come back.

4792
02:11:55,551 --> 02:11:56,720
She's got to go after running around.

4793
02:11:56,750 --> 02:11:56,871
Yeah,

4794
02:11:56,871 --> 02:11:57,704
but I mean they have to,

4795
02:11:57,710 --> 02:12:00,560
once she comes back then she has to
have a hearing to try to get her license

4796
02:12:00,561 --> 02:12:01,394
back.

4797
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:01,671
You know?

4798
02:12:01,671 --> 02:12:04,100
It's not as simple as you
come back once you come back.

4799
02:12:04,101 --> 02:12:05,000
He's due to you.

4800
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:06,560
Once you do the suspension,

4801
02:12:06,561 --> 02:12:07,010
you're good.

4802
02:12:07,010 --> 02:12:08,720
I don't know if that's
necessarily the truth.

4803
02:12:08,930 --> 02:12:11,410
I'm not sure if to
stall subpoenaed at ACA.

4804
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:15,140
I think you have to get licensed because
I think that like Chell son and when

4805
02:12:15,141 --> 02:12:15,591
they had a fight,

4806
02:12:15,591 --> 02:12:16,161
Anderson Silva,

4807
02:12:16,161 --> 02:12:18,800
he had to get licensed in Nevada
and that was a part of the thing.

4808
02:12:18,801 --> 02:12:23,390
It wasn't just a chill son and had been
that he had been a band for x amount of

4809
02:12:23,391 --> 02:12:23,960
months.

4810
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:25,400
He also had to get licensed.

4811
02:12:25,490 --> 02:12:26,660
So I don't know.

4812
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:28,760
I don't know the whole process I think,

4813
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:29,780
I think,

4814
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:30,613
you know,

4815
02:12:30,650 --> 02:12:31,483
there should be consent.

4816
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:36,680
There's a difference between a woman doing
performance enhancing drugs and a man

4817
02:12:36,681 --> 02:12:37,370
doing them.

4818
02:12:37,370 --> 02:12:38,120
In my opinion,

4819
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:42,350
when a woman starts in introducing things
that just don't exist in that level

4820
02:12:42,351 --> 02:12:43,460
ever in our body,

4821
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:44,300
you know,

4822
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:45,920
it's different thing to that.

4823
02:12:45,921 --> 02:12:50,270
Then a guy taking like testosterone
replacement therapy to try to be like a

4824
02:12:50,271 --> 02:12:51,104
young man again.

4825
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:52,460
It's really kind of tricky.

4826
02:12:52,850 --> 02:12:53,683
It's uh,

4827
02:12:54,050 --> 02:12:54,411
it's,

4828
02:12:54,411 --> 02:12:54,760
it's,

4829
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:56,240
it's almost like you're a,

4830
02:12:56,290 --> 02:12:56,570
if you,

4831
02:12:56,570 --> 02:12:59,750
you can't go down that slippery path cause
they're like we talked about like the

4832
02:12:59,751 --> 02:13:00,620
weight cutting thing.

4833
02:13:00,710 --> 02:13:01,760
If everybody has to wait,

4834
02:13:01,761 --> 02:13:02,330
cut man,

4835
02:13:02,330 --> 02:13:02,631
man,

4836
02:13:02,631 --> 02:13:03,680
that kind of fucks things up.

4837
02:13:03,681 --> 02:13:05,750
It would be better if everybody
didn't have to rake weight cut.

4838
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:07,400
It'd be nice if that was the reality.

4839
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:10,040
Well if women start taking male hormones,

4840
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:11,480
that is a mess.

4841
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:14,570
That ruins the whole idea
of the woman's sport.

4842
02:13:14,630 --> 02:13:15,021
You know,

4843
02:13:15,021 --> 02:13:15,854
if you,

4844
02:13:15,950 --> 02:13:17,870
if you have women taking male hormones,

4845
02:13:17,970 --> 02:13:18,451
there's a,

4846
02:13:18,451 --> 02:13:20,060
that's not women fighting anymore.

4847
02:13:20,090 --> 02:13:21,200
That's a hybrid.

4848
02:13:21,230 --> 02:13:23,090
That's a woman man hybrid.

4849
02:13:23,130 --> 02:13:24,620
Women with male hormones,

4850
02:13:24,621 --> 02:13:27,710
like you're fucking the
whole tree of life up there.

4851
02:13:27,770 --> 02:13:31,350
Like this isn't just you
trying to reclaim lost youth.

4852
02:13:31,351 --> 02:13:32,220
You're creating

4853
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:35,070
a thing that's not quite a woman anymore.

4854
02:13:35,190 --> 02:13:36,030
That's what that is.

4855
02:13:36,031 --> 02:13:36,181
You're,

4856
02:13:36,181 --> 02:13:39,030
you're adding some shit to a
woman that doesn't belong there.

4857
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:42,600
And I think that has to
be taken very seriously.

4858
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:43,723
That's

4859
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:46,620
so sad.

4860
02:13:46,620 --> 02:13:47,311
It's so sad.

4861
02:13:47,311 --> 02:13:48,570
And that's what they have to do,

4862
02:13:48,571 --> 02:13:48,841
right?

4863
02:13:48,841 --> 02:13:51,150
Because that's what that sport
demands because the look,

4864
02:13:51,151 --> 02:13:53,160
it's all about body
dysmorphia at that point.

4865
02:13:53,161 --> 02:13:54,660
When you're involved in bodybuilding,

4866
02:13:54,810 --> 02:13:56,640
it's just like when you see a woman,

4867
02:13:57,150 --> 02:13:59,760
and no disrespect to anybody who has this,

4868
02:13:59,790 --> 02:14:00,061
you know,

4869
02:14:00,061 --> 02:14:01,800
your tits are too big and you're crazy.

4870
02:14:01,870 --> 02:14:02,211
You know,

4871
02:14:02,211 --> 02:14:04,800
like you just get like a
thousand CC's and they're like,

4872
02:14:04,801 --> 02:14:06,210
I want to get another 200 like,

4873
02:14:06,211 --> 02:14:07,350
what are you doing?

4874
02:14:07,530 --> 02:14:08,363
Stop it.

4875
02:14:08,550 --> 02:14:08,671
Like,

4876
02:14:08,671 --> 02:14:11,160
have you ever seen those videos on these
people that can't stop getting bigger

4877
02:14:11,161 --> 02:14:11,461
and bigger?

4878
02:14:11,461 --> 02:14:12,091
10 implants.

4879
02:14:12,091 --> 02:14:12,690
They're crazy.

4880
02:14:12,690 --> 02:14:13,120
That's,

4881
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:14,400
that's how bodybuilders are.

4882
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:16,950
And they get this body
dysmorphia and they just,

4883
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:18,360
it's not about looking good.

4884
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:20,970
Like if you go back to
like the Frank Zane days,

4885
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:23,220
you know you go back to
like before steroids,

4886
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:23,551
you know,

4887
02:14:23,551 --> 02:14:26,940
that guy was in tremendous shape and he
was proportioned and it was all about

4888
02:14:26,941 --> 02:14:30,570
making your body working hard
to get your body in proportion.

4889
02:14:30,810 --> 02:14:34,980
Then it became about steroids and then
the Arnold Schwarzenegger error and then

4890
02:14:34,981 --> 02:14:35,814
forward,

4891
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:36,030
you know,

4892
02:14:36,030 --> 02:14:36,421
into the,

4893
02:14:36,421 --> 02:14:37,710
like the Lee Haney era.

4894
02:14:37,711 --> 02:14:40,170
It became about these cartoonish,

4895
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:42,000
monstrous human beings.

4896
02:14:42,450 --> 02:14:44,160
It became straight Tom Platz.

4897
02:14:44,190 --> 02:14:46,200
It became strained body dysmorphia.

4898
02:14:46,530 --> 02:14:49,140
As soon as they figured out how
to add drugs into the equation,

4899
02:14:49,170 --> 02:14:53,700
everything got completely wacky and women
started getting wacky to which one was

4900
02:14:53,701 --> 02:14:54,330
Frank Zane.

4901
02:14:54,330 --> 02:14:54,660
This is,

4902
02:14:54,660 --> 02:14:56,910
there's a woman who lived down the
street from me and I won't say her name,

4903
02:14:56,911 --> 02:15:01,800
but she was a very successful female
bodybuilder back in the day and now she

4904
02:15:01,801 --> 02:15:02,634
looks,

4905
02:15:03,060 --> 02:15:05,280
she looks like she's paid a price for it.

4906
02:15:05,281 --> 02:15:05,910
Man,

4907
02:15:05,910 --> 02:15:06,820
it's sad when he sees her.

4908
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:09,900
She has a lot of masculine
characteristics that she shouldn't have.

4909
02:15:10,290 --> 02:15:11,123
She looks like,

4910
02:15:11,170 --> 02:15:13,740
like she fucking hijacked or system.

4911
02:15:13,741 --> 02:15:13,891
Like,

4912
02:15:13,891 --> 02:15:14,550
she just,

4913
02:15:14,550 --> 02:15:15,600
she morphed herself,

4914
02:15:15,870 --> 02:15:16,350
you know,

4915
02:15:16,350 --> 02:15:18,270
she marked herself and
turned herself into a man.

4916
02:15:18,271 --> 02:15:18,870
Basically.

4917
02:15:18,870 --> 02:15:19,860
It's fucking crazy,

4918
02:15:19,861 --> 02:15:20,550
man.

4919
02:15:20,550 --> 02:15:21,210
It's crazy.

4920
02:15:21,210 --> 02:15:23,040
Like she's wears makeups,

4921
02:15:23,041 --> 02:15:24,900
tries to be womeny but you like,

4922
02:15:24,901 --> 02:15:27,330
you know what she used to look
like and what she did to herself.

4923
02:15:27,331 --> 02:15:30,060
She turned herself into some
sort of a masculine creation.

4924
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:31,800
And even when they get off this stuff,

4925
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:33,660
they still maintain some,

4926
02:15:33,690 --> 02:15:35,100
some masculine features.

4927
02:15:35,101 --> 02:15:36,150
It's really strange.

4928
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:37,200
You know,

4929
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:37,950
they uh,

4930
02:15:37,950 --> 02:15:39,150
their body grows.

4931
02:15:39,240 --> 02:15:40,290
Shepparton gets big,

4932
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:40,741
you know,

4933
02:15:40,741 --> 02:15:40,951
it's,

4934
02:15:40,951 --> 02:15:41,520
um,

4935
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:44,940
it's a very unfortunate thing that
someone decided that that looks good for

4936
02:15:44,941 --> 02:15:45,670
women.

4937
02:15:45,670 --> 02:15:50,520
They taken some crazy shit that makes
you closer to a man because a fit woman

4938
02:15:50,550 --> 02:15:51,010
is,

4939
02:15:51,010 --> 02:15:55,590
it's beautiful to look at a fit woman
and to not accept that a fit woman is

4940
02:15:55,591 --> 02:15:56,970
going to look different than a fit man.

4941
02:15:56,970 --> 02:15:59,430
It's craziness of fit woman.

4942
02:15:59,431 --> 02:16:00,660
A woman who was in great shape.

4943
02:16:00,661 --> 02:16:01,141
It works out.

4944
02:16:01,141 --> 02:16:01,501
Like I said,

4945
02:16:01,501 --> 02:16:03,810
those crossfit girls that sexy as fuck,

4946
02:16:03,811 --> 02:16:04,100
man,

4947
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:04,620
let's got girls.

4948
02:16:04,620 --> 02:16:05,580
I've incredible bodies,

4949
02:16:05,970 --> 02:16:07,470
but they look like a girl.

4950
02:16:07,620 --> 02:16:09,960
They look like a woman
who's in great shape.

4951
02:16:10,290 --> 02:16:15,290
You've got to Noho cc the chicken
Nigos which cross train like my God,

4952
02:16:17,730 --> 02:16:19,500
she's got a body that don't fucking,

4953
02:16:19,530 --> 02:16:19,651
well,

4954
02:16:19,651 --> 02:16:22,200
Rhonda Rousey doesn't like the
fact that her arms real big.

4955
02:16:22,201 --> 02:16:23,520
Like when she came on the podcast like,

4956
02:16:23,790 --> 02:16:24,121
oh,

4957
02:16:24,121 --> 02:16:25,620
everyone's going to see 'em all yoked.

4958
02:16:25,890 --> 02:16:26,270
You know,

4959
02:16:26,270 --> 02:16:27,270
I kind of want to cover my cover,

4960
02:16:27,271 --> 02:16:27,680
my sleep.

4961
02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:28,111
We were like,

4962
02:16:28,111 --> 02:16:29,040
what are you talking about?

4963
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:30,490
Her body sensational.

4964
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:31,990
It's sensational.

4965
02:16:32,840 --> 02:16:33,420
Oh,

4966
02:16:33,420 --> 02:16:34,253
but great girl.

4967
02:16:34,330 --> 02:16:35,140
But she's,

4968
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:40,030
but she is so strong that to a guy who
doesn't exercise or diet doesn't work

4969
02:16:40,031 --> 02:16:40,390
out.

4970
02:16:40,390 --> 02:16:41,170
Like Brian,

4971
02:16:41,170 --> 02:16:42,160
she's very intimidating.

4972
02:16:42,170 --> 02:16:42,851
She was fucking him.

4973
02:16:42,851 --> 02:16:44,380
She wouldn't ever let him be on top.

4974
02:16:44,410 --> 02:16:46,180
Like how are you going to
get on top of Ronda Rousey?

4975
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:47,620
You're not okay.

4976
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:48,490
Well she's gonna,

4977
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:49,450
she's gonna fuck you.

4978
02:16:50,110 --> 02:16:50,943
Fuck you forget.

4979
02:16:51,100 --> 02:16:53,260
She weighs one 45 well one 35 now,

4980
02:16:53,261 --> 02:16:54,094
which find it.

4981
02:16:54,330 --> 02:16:55,360
I bet you she's ticklish.

4982
02:16:55,361 --> 02:16:59,140
I find take their spot and no
matter was just stop talking.

4983
02:16:59,141 --> 02:17:01,630
She'll wake you at great legs
to do whatever she wants you.

4984
02:17:03,130 --> 02:17:03,700
I was like,

4985
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:04,533
God,

4986
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:05,380
yeah,

4987
02:17:05,380 --> 02:17:06,490
she's got an incredible body,

4988
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:07,570
sexy side.

4989
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:08,650
But that's a woman's body.

4990
02:17:08,651 --> 02:17:09,480
You know what I'm saying?

4991
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:10,540
There's no doubt about it.

4992
02:17:10,541 --> 02:17:11,291
That's a woman's body.

4993
02:17:11,291 --> 02:17:11,651
It's not.

4994
02:17:11,651 --> 02:17:11,920
It's an,

4995
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:13,210
there's nothing creepy about that.

4996
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:15,490
The only time it gets creepy
is when you do creepy shit.

4997
02:17:15,730 --> 02:17:16,630
When you do creepy shit,

4998
02:17:16,631 --> 02:17:17,920
that's when your body
starts looking creepy.

4999
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:19,450
There's just no way around that man.

5000
02:17:19,451 --> 02:17:21,850
You can't take male
hormones and the be still,

5001
02:17:21,851 --> 02:17:22,930
it's like a sexy woman.

5002
02:17:22,931 --> 02:17:23,980
Like that's just weird.

5003
02:17:24,250 --> 02:17:24,701
But they,

5004
02:17:24,701 --> 02:17:28,330
the dude's in that bodybuilding world
that liked those types of checks and they

5005
02:17:28,331 --> 02:17:29,290
get into that man.

5006
02:17:29,291 --> 02:17:30,124
They like it.

5007
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:30,490
Uh,

5008
02:17:30,490 --> 02:17:31,323
she's a freak.

5009
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:32,251
My girls are free.

5010
02:17:32,251 --> 02:17:33,220
You got to see your quads,

5011
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:33,611
honey.

5012
02:17:33,611 --> 02:17:37,120
Show me your quads and they give
this fucking spray tan the leg.

5013
02:17:37,140 --> 02:17:41,920
It's like black as coal and
flex their dirty painted toes.

5014
02:17:43,520 --> 02:17:46,690
And you'll see some strike patients
in that thought and they're like,

5015
02:17:46,691 --> 02:17:47,980
what are you doing?

5016
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:49,450
Why is that there?

5017
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:50,613
Why do you have this?

5018
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:52,450
Why is there no fat on your leg?

5019
02:17:52,690 --> 02:17:57,690
What can I see all the fucking ligaments
in the muscle fibers under there?

5020
02:17:58,560 --> 02:17:59,650
Cause like I always looked at them,

5021
02:17:59,950 --> 02:18:02,530
that little push to get trolled tiny flat

5022
02:18:04,110 --> 02:18:07,510
chizen you go to suck a tit
and it's hard right away.

5023
02:18:07,510 --> 02:18:08,830
You gotta be fucking tripping.

5024
02:18:09,070 --> 02:18:13,180
Cause when they strike Jewson they get
the same thing in here is guys gift for

5025
02:18:13,181 --> 02:18:15,400
doing like close grip
bench presses and all that.

5026
02:18:15,610 --> 02:18:19,450
This starts to get little fucking things
inside their chest that's discussing it

5027
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:21,730
and also they have little titties.

5028
02:18:22,450 --> 02:18:25,120
I looked at them like I've been through
one of those contexts years ago.

5029
02:18:25,121 --> 02:18:26,030
My buddy can beat it.

5030
02:18:26,031 --> 02:18:28,780
So I went and I was watching these
chicks are going to look at those,

5031
02:18:28,860 --> 02:18:29,260
you know,

5032
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:33,160
look at dead bodies but at least
even it could just save the Monkey.

5033
02:18:34,150 --> 02:18:36,260
Could you save the monkey cause all that.

5034
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:38,110
Well they grow clits Bro.

5035
02:18:38,111 --> 02:18:40,000
Hooky strengths up the cleats,

5036
02:18:40,090 --> 02:18:42,070
everything Shreesh the click grows.

5037
02:18:42,071 --> 02:18:42,800
Joey,

5038
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:46,490
have you ever seen all the
girls like a dick dude,

5039
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:47,410
it grows like a deck.

5040
02:18:48,220 --> 02:18:48,870
Yes.

5041
02:18:48,870 --> 02:18:51,700
Chicks badge off and she got one
of those tight little habits.

5042
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:52,660
I'm fucking out of that.

5043
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:54,520
I'm telling you it grows like a dick.

5044
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:54,691
Yeah,

5045
02:18:54,691 --> 02:18:55,540
I've seen it online.

5046
02:18:55,541 --> 02:18:56,620
I've never seen it in real life.

5047
02:18:56,621 --> 02:18:57,340
You've never seen it?

5048
02:18:57,340 --> 02:18:57,820
No,

5049
02:18:57,820 --> 02:18:58,060
no.

5050
02:18:58,060 --> 02:18:58,780
In real life.

5051
02:18:58,780 --> 02:18:59,613
I've never had,

5052
02:18:59,740 --> 02:19:02,680
I dated this one girl who was a
bodybuilder when I was like 20,

5053
02:19:02,890 --> 02:19:03,790
and she was,

5054
02:19:03,791 --> 02:19:04,000
uh,

5055
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:04,960
she was from New Hampshire.

5056
02:19:04,961 --> 02:19:06,130
It's pitch was loked out.

5057
02:19:06,370 --> 02:19:08,290
I was 21 because I was doing comedy.

5058
02:19:08,500 --> 02:19:09,870
She was a fucking was the first girl,

5059
02:19:10,110 --> 02:19:11,890
first girl ever about that,

5060
02:19:11,891 --> 02:19:13,420
but I never seen I die Bro.

5061
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:14,530
This girl wasn't like that.

5062
02:19:14,531 --> 02:19:15,364
She was natural.

5063
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:15,761
There was,

5064
02:19:15,761 --> 02:19:17,980
this was 1988,

5065
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:19,210
whatever it was.

5066
02:19:19,210 --> 02:19:20,200
I don't think too many checks.

5067
02:19:20,201 --> 02:19:21,034
We're doing it that way.

5068
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:21,850
But uh,

5069
02:19:21,850 --> 02:19:22,391
she was,

5070
02:19:22,391 --> 02:19:22,690
uh,

5071
02:19:22,690 --> 02:19:24,820
she was just so fucking down.

5072
02:19:24,821 --> 02:19:25,654
This girl's crazy.

5073
02:19:25,990 --> 02:19:26,561
We had sex.

5074
02:19:26,561 --> 02:19:28,070
She was on her period and she sucked the

5075
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:29,420
blood off my deck.

5076
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:30,711
That's how crazy.

5077
02:19:30,711 --> 02:19:31,430
This bitch was.

5078
02:19:31,430 --> 02:19:32,000
Good girl.

5079
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:32,421
I was like,

5080
02:19:32,421 --> 02:19:32,811
yeah,

5081
02:19:32,811 --> 02:19:33,800
but you're on your period.

5082
02:19:33,830 --> 02:19:35,900
She just looked at me and
starts sucking and I was like,

5083
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:37,580
Whoa,

5084
02:19:38,180 --> 02:19:39,660
God,

5085
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:41,580
that's a rare girl.

5086
02:19:41,870 --> 02:19:42,760
My fucking faith.

5087
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:43,620
That's a rare girl.

5088
02:19:43,970 --> 02:19:46,310
Like lick the clots and
everything off your Dick Nick.

5089
02:19:46,311 --> 02:19:48,140
The big black blood clots.

5090
02:19:48,290 --> 02:19:49,550
There was no black blood clots.

5091
02:19:49,551 --> 02:19:50,990
Unfortunately it was just a lot of red,

5092
02:19:50,991 --> 02:19:52,400
but she didn't give a fuck dude.

5093
02:19:52,490 --> 02:19:52,791
You know what?

5094
02:19:52,791 --> 02:19:54,830
She just starts sucking it down.

5095
02:19:54,831 --> 02:19:56,270
When you fuck a girl in the muffler,

5096
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:57,970
you put it in the fucking mouth.

5097
02:19:57,971 --> 02:20:00,680
You know who first invented that?

5098
02:20:01,330 --> 02:20:01,971
My happy.

5099
02:20:01,971 --> 02:20:05,390
She's my girlfriend or
my sad like am I sad?

5100
02:20:05,391 --> 02:20:07,010
But I just stuff it up a fucking ass.

5101
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:07,881
Whatever's good.

5102
02:20:07,881 --> 02:20:08,714
You should be happy.

5103
02:20:08,780 --> 02:20:09,800
Did you want to do that?

5104
02:20:09,801 --> 02:20:12,290
Did it feel good that she get off
on it then you should both be happy.

5105
02:20:13,220 --> 02:20:14,070
Only if she's clean.

5106
02:20:14,071 --> 02:20:14,990
It's not that disgusting.

5107
02:20:15,050 --> 02:20:16,400
She got to wash it all out though.

5108
02:20:16,430 --> 02:20:17,263
It's got to go to work.

5109
02:20:17,270 --> 02:20:17,690
I've heard.

5110
02:20:17,690 --> 02:20:20,780
Can't just casually watch
your asshole and have shit.

5111
02:20:20,781 --> 02:20:21,580
Aga Addictions.

5112
02:20:21,580 --> 02:20:23,630
Shit has never happened to
me cause I fucked and faint.

5113
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:28,430
I wake up and beat the girl merciful
to me for having a dirty ass.

5114
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:29,930
It's a scared me like that.

5115
02:20:30,510 --> 02:20:33,590
I would fucking like the time in Seattle
and I put the bottle in the girl's

5116
02:20:33,591 --> 02:20:35,670
pussy and we put up work
at all in the grill.

5117
02:20:36,410 --> 02:20:37,640
Why was that the same chicken?

5118
02:20:37,641 --> 02:20:42,641
I found the aluminum foil harass that
saved chicken were in Seattle and that was

5119
02:20:43,191 --> 02:20:43,630
tricky.

5120
02:20:43,630 --> 02:20:43,790
Uh,

5121
02:20:43,790 --> 02:20:44,181
you know,

5122
02:20:44,181 --> 02:20:44,680
uh,

5123
02:20:44,680 --> 02:20:45,710
Gallo brothers wine.

5124
02:20:45,711 --> 02:20:46,370
Cool.

5125
02:20:46,370 --> 02:20:48,500
And I started rubbing the
bottom and I'm a little bulky.

5126
02:20:48,501 --> 02:20:49,340
She was a stripper.

5127
02:20:49,640 --> 02:20:52,670
And then I pulled a little thing and
I started working the fucking bottle.

5128
02:20:53,100 --> 02:20:55,580
It's like a little
monkey that's dangerous.

5129
02:20:55,581 --> 02:20:58,730
That has killed the girl fucking story.

5130
02:20:58,731 --> 02:21:01,880
Fatty Arbuckle fucking work on
this bottle is a little monkey,

5131
02:21:01,881 --> 02:21:02,450
right?

5132
02:21:02,450 --> 02:21:04,640
And I'm down there about
to lick the fucking click.

5133
02:21:04,940 --> 02:21:05,900
And next thing you know here,

5134
02:21:07,490 --> 02:21:12,490
the suction of the bottle at suck the
period Outta oh round vampire blood from

5135
02:21:12,951 --> 02:21:15,830
blade shattered was

5136
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:18,593
a little darker.

5137
02:21:18,990 --> 02:21:20,180
It was just disgusting,

5138
02:21:20,430 --> 02:21:20,721
Bro.

5139
02:21:20,721 --> 02:21:22,040
I fainted because I,

5140
02:21:22,041 --> 02:21:22,671
my mind,

5141
02:21:22,671 --> 02:21:23,840
I caught her with a bottle.

5142
02:21:23,841 --> 02:21:24,291
I was like,

5143
02:21:24,291 --> 02:21:24,741
no.

5144
02:21:24,741 --> 02:21:25,011
I'm like,

5145
02:21:25,011 --> 02:21:26,600
I cut real.

5146
02:21:26,780 --> 02:21:27,680
I've went down.

5147
02:21:27,681 --> 02:21:28,514
She had a walk.

5148
02:21:29,170 --> 02:21:31,370
God fucking animal.

5149
02:21:31,580 --> 02:21:32,600
She didn't give a fuck.

5150
02:21:32,890 --> 02:21:33,870
About a month earlier,

5151
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:36,650
I pulled the fucking little
aluminum foil out of her ass.

5152
02:21:36,690 --> 02:21:37,610
That was the same girl,

5153
02:21:37,670 --> 02:21:38,510
chicken Seattle.

5154
02:21:38,660 --> 02:21:39,370
That was good.

5155
02:21:39,370 --> 02:21:40,370
That was a year and a half.

5156
02:21:40,371 --> 02:21:42,170
A fucking great freaky stories.

5157
02:21:42,171 --> 02:21:43,910
Tell me things that you stick in a girl.

5158
02:21:43,980 --> 02:21:44,190
Well,

5159
02:21:44,190 --> 02:21:44,541
you know,

5160
02:21:44,541 --> 02:21:46,850
she was a fucking savage only live once.

5161
02:21:46,850 --> 02:21:48,840
If you're dating a savage
and you really like aren't,

5162
02:21:49,070 --> 02:21:49,821
you're not in love with her.

5163
02:21:49,821 --> 02:21:52,490
You try to do shit to her
until she breaks up with you.

5164
02:21:52,491 --> 02:21:52,641
Right.

5165
02:21:52,641 --> 02:21:56,120
It is amazing how much people very
unlike like that girl that would suck the

5166
02:21:56,121 --> 02:21:56,930
blood off your deck.

5167
02:21:56,930 --> 02:21:57,260
Wow,

5168
02:21:57,260 --> 02:21:58,580
that's so variable.

5169
02:21:58,820 --> 02:22:01,070
You know like the real freakiness
like when you meet someone,

5170
02:22:01,071 --> 02:22:01,851
what they're down for,

5171
02:22:01,851 --> 02:22:02,684
what they're not,

5172
02:22:03,050 --> 02:22:03,800
you know,

5173
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:03,981
like,

5174
02:22:03,981 --> 02:22:04,131
yeah,

5175
02:22:04,131 --> 02:22:04,851
you ever date a girl,

5176
02:22:04,851 --> 02:22:05,350
you just,

5177
02:22:05,350 --> 02:22:09,000
you just start dating and she jerked you
off on her tongue while she's looking

5178
02:22:09,001 --> 02:22:10,370
you in the eye and you're like,

5179
02:22:10,371 --> 02:22:11,001
Whoa,

5180
02:22:11,001 --> 02:22:11,630
what?

5181
02:22:11,630 --> 02:22:13,770
We just started hanging
out and you're you,

5182
02:22:13,780 --> 02:22:15,140
you're opening with this.

5183
02:22:15,490 --> 02:22:15,860
Like,

5184
02:22:15,860 --> 02:22:17,000
God damn,

5185
02:22:17,001 --> 02:22:18,470
where the fuck is this gone?

5186
02:22:18,471 --> 02:22:19,680
You turned me onto something.

5187
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:23,030
I almost called you at four in the morning
and called Your Cock sucker 20 times

5188
02:22:23,420 --> 02:22:26,010
because it was one of the most
devastating things that I've seen in

5189
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,870
my life and I'm not being funny right now.

5190
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:31,560
And how you sick motherfuckers
watch that shit is beyond me.

5191
02:22:32,010 --> 02:22:36,090
I finally watched that Sasha Grey video
that you referred to me when the 20 guys

5192
02:22:36,091 --> 02:22:38,580
are fucking up and she's
got a dick in her ass.

5193
02:22:38,581 --> 02:22:42,900
And but the funny thing about the via
is extras and the video and they're just

5194
02:22:42,901 --> 02:22:45,390
standing around and jerking
off with that dicks waiting.

5195
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:46,740
And I'm sitting there going,

5196
02:22:46,950 --> 02:22:51,210
Joe Rogan is a fucking lunatic
for making me watch this shit.

5197
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:53,670
Sasha Gray looks like they beat her.

5198
02:22:54,180 --> 02:22:56,950
Like she sucked and fucked
20 guys like you sweat.

5199
02:22:56,951 --> 02:22:57,870
And that's all wet.

5200
02:22:58,230 --> 02:23:00,630
Like it looks like she was in a
work after they were punching her.

5201
02:23:00,690 --> 02:23:02,640
She's a fascinating chick
cause she's a very smart,

5202
02:23:03,580 --> 02:23:04,110
no,

5203
02:23:04,110 --> 02:23:04,321
no.

5204
02:23:04,321 --> 02:23:05,220
It's interesting though.

5205
02:23:05,221 --> 02:23:06,600
I've ever heard of be interviewed.

5206
02:23:06,601 --> 02:23:08,880
I've read some of her
interviews and she's deaf.

5207
02:23:08,910 --> 02:23:10,260
Deverie definitely very smart.

5208
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:11,640

Just Day to know Danny.

5213
02:23:14,901 --> 02:23:15,441
Dear mom,

5214
02:23:15,441 --> 02:23:16,860

5215
02:23:16,861 --> 02:23:18,210
she's done a lot of crazy shit too.

5216
02:23:18,510 --> 02:23:19,360
And she's been on a pump.

5217
02:23:19,370 --> 02:23:20,203
She's a nice girl.

5218
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:21,191
That was on the other night.

5219
02:23:21,191 --> 02:23:24,000
The other night she was saying she put
things that are asked and everything.

5220
02:23:24,001 --> 02:23:24,834
She's crazy.

5221
02:23:24,880 --> 02:23:25,480
I read,

5222
02:23:25,480 --> 02:23:26,970
retweeted one of her lines one time.

5223
02:23:26,971 --> 02:23:27,421
It said,

5224
02:23:27,421 --> 02:23:27,750

5225
02:23:27,750 --> 02:23:30,150

thing that's ever been in my ass?

5226
02:23:30,151 --> 02:23:31,410

5227
02:23:32,680 --> 02:23:34,260

02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:35,340
Me More cat toys.

5229
02:23:35,430 --> 02:23:36,570
She's crazy.

5230
02:23:36,930 --> 02:23:37,561
She's crazy.

5231
02:23:37,561 --> 02:23:38,190
But she's fun.

5232
02:23:38,190 --> 02:23:41,010
She's look all I give a
fuck all I give a fuck.

5233
02:23:41,220 --> 02:23:42,330
All your Nice Dude,

5234
02:23:42,331 --> 02:23:42,460
what?

5235
02:23:42,460 --> 02:23:44,750
I meet you or you're a nice
person and you're nice dude.

5236
02:23:44,751 --> 02:23:45,584
Can we get along?

5237
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:46,080
And I meet her.

5238
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:46,913
She's always friendly.

5239
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:47,390
You know,

5240
02:23:47,390 --> 02:23:48,180
I'm judge,

5241
02:23:48,180 --> 02:23:48,840
she's nice.

5242
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:50,730
She's nice to be around.

5243
02:23:50,731 --> 02:23:51,630
I bet she's very nice,

5244
02:23:51,631 --> 02:23:52,770
but I'm gonna be worried about it.

5245
02:23:52,830 --> 02:23:53,663
Yeah,

5246
02:23:53,740 --> 02:23:54,573
be worried.

5247
02:23:54,810 --> 02:23:56,580
I'm always worried psychologically.

5248
02:23:56,581 --> 02:24:00,690
And when I see someone do one of those
crazy movies where you know there's 15 to

5249
02:24:00,691 --> 02:24:02,130
as you're choking off in your eyeballs,

5250
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:02,881
you know,

5251
02:24:02,881 --> 02:24:03,301
it's like,

5252
02:24:03,301 --> 02:24:05,170
what is that like dog?

5253
02:24:05,171 --> 02:24:06,320
She had it and I was on,

5254
02:24:06,330 --> 02:24:07,380
I was really disturbed.

5255
02:24:07,381 --> 02:24:07,531
Like,

5256
02:24:07,531 --> 02:24:07,891
I'm like,

5257
02:24:07,891 --> 02:24:10,650
this is crazy that people are
telling me I'm dirty on stage.

5258
02:24:11,070 --> 02:24:13,530
You got to see this shit
this and people want,

5259
02:24:13,531 --> 02:24:14,430
there's a market for that.

5260
02:24:14,431 --> 02:24:19,431
Like I didn't an that people pulling their
hair and they're fucking putting shit

5261
02:24:19,801 --> 02:24:20,380
in her mouth.

5262
02:24:20,380 --> 02:24:21,600
I was crying.

5263
02:24:22,050 --> 02:24:23,340
I almost started fucking crying.

5264
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:25,230
I felt that fucking emotional.

5265
02:24:25,231 --> 02:24:27,660
Wait until you have a daughter
and then you watch it.

5266
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:29,933
Yeah,

5267
02:24:30,210 --> 02:24:31,080
I watched that.

5268
02:24:31,210 --> 02:24:32,370
Did you watch that with your daughter?

5269
02:24:32,590 --> 02:24:34,620
And I'm sensing watch it with your toe.

5270
02:24:34,670 --> 02:24:35,110
You know what I mean?

5271
02:24:35,110 --> 02:24:38,460
I'm saying think about the fact that you
have a daughter in that your daughter

5272
02:24:38,461 --> 02:24:39,780
could grow up to be that girl.

5273
02:24:39,781 --> 02:24:40,690
I the way I was the only time,

5274
02:24:40,770 --> 02:24:42,000
but here's the other problem.

5275
02:24:42,030 --> 02:24:42,870
She likes it.

5276
02:24:43,050 --> 02:24:44,250
She says she likes it.

5277
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:45,330
I don't,

5278
02:24:45,330 --> 02:24:46,163
I don't want it.

5279
02:24:46,410 --> 02:24:47,330
But if,

5280
02:24:47,331 --> 02:24:47,590
uh,

5281
02:24:47,590 --> 02:24:47,810
you,

5282
02:24:47,810 --> 02:24:48,140
you,

5283
02:24:48,140 --> 02:24:48,760
you had to,

5284
02:24:48,760 --> 02:24:49,030
you know,

5285
02:24:49,030 --> 02:24:49,411
tell me,

5286
02:24:49,411 --> 02:24:49,920
hey,

5287
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:53,430
somebody offered a Sam
Tripoli a movie and he's a,

5288
02:24:53,431 --> 02:24:57,150
he's got to do it and he
gets to fuck a 15 hot girls.

5289
02:24:57,450 --> 02:25:02,160
Sam Aaa would do that in my mind is it's
bad for Sam trebly if he's lying there

5290
02:25:02,161 --> 02:25:04,080
in 15 girls are shoving
her pussy and his face.

5291
02:25:04,110 --> 02:25:04,890
Is that bad?

5292
02:25:04,890 --> 02:25:05,221
No,

5293
02:25:05,221 --> 02:25:06,000
it's not bad.

5294
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,190
So why is it bad that she fucks 20 dudes?

5295
02:25:08,430 --> 02:25:08,581
Well,

5296
02:25:08,581 --> 02:25:09,540
it's only bad really,

5297
02:25:09,541 --> 02:25:10,920
because in our mind it's bad,

5298
02:25:10,930 --> 02:25:11,491
but you shouldn't,

5299
02:25:11,491 --> 02:25:12,270
shouldn't like that.

5300
02:25:12,270 --> 02:25:13,200
But she says she likes.

5301
02:25:13,230 --> 02:25:14,011
How much would they pay?

5302
02:25:14,011 --> 02:25:14,970
Like Sasha grey.

5303
02:25:14,990 --> 02:25:18,810
Like any idea of a bunch
of grant more than anybody.

5304
02:25:18,811 --> 02:25:20,280
He's friends with all
those choices these days.

5305
02:25:20,281 --> 02:25:20,730
They're not,

5306
02:25:20,730 --> 02:25:21,170
I dunno.

5307
02:25:21,170 --> 02:25:22,520
Nowadays they're not getting,

5308
02:25:23,290 --> 02:25:24,370
they're not getting that much money.

5309
02:25:24,371 --> 02:25:26,280
Like Sasha Grey for fucking 16 now.

5310
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:28,730
I know a girl that just did
her first 60 bucks for that.

5311
02:25:28,870 --> 02:25:30,970
I know a girl hit her first anal,

5312
02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:32,590
her first anal.

5313
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:36,700
I know this girl and she's like a
pretty new up and coming up in comedy.

5314
02:25:36,710 --> 02:25:37,470
But you think like,

5315
02:25:37,470 --> 02:25:38,360
you know for your calmer,

5316
02:25:38,580 --> 02:25:39,430
you think you would have,

5317
02:25:39,580 --> 02:25:41,530
she would get a lot of
money for her first time,

5318
02:25:41,531 --> 02:25:42,640
but it was like $1,000 Oh,

5319
02:25:42,690 --> 02:25:43,011
how fun.

5320
02:25:43,011 --> 02:25:44,020
Is that up and comer?

5321
02:25:44,340 --> 02:25:44,451
Well,

5322
02:25:44,451 --> 02:25:45,261
she's an up and comer.

5323
02:25:45,261 --> 02:25:45,491
Yeah,

5324
02:25:45,491 --> 02:25:46,151
she's fucking,

5325
02:25:46,151 --> 02:25:47,710
she's got to scale the great heights.

5326
02:25:47,740 --> 02:25:47,831
Oh,

5327
02:25:47,831 --> 02:25:48,910
it's come with it you though.

5328
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:49,661
Yeah,

5329
02:25:49,661 --> 02:25:51,460
but I'm saying the idea of
like where are you going to go?

5330
02:25:52,170 --> 02:25:54,010
Bucks to get fucked in the ass.

5331
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:55,233
This is what I'm saying,

5332
02:25:55,300 --> 02:25:57,010
but this is like,

5333
02:25:59,950 --> 02:26:00,190
oh,

5334
02:26:00,190 --> 02:26:01,023
a lot more than that.

5335
02:26:01,820 --> 02:26:02,653
What if it's good?

5336
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:05,800
No bonuses.

5337
02:26:06,940 --> 02:26:07,360
Yeah.

5338
02:26:07,360 --> 02:26:10,150
White people fucking pay
for your hair and makeup.

5339
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:11,440
You pay for your fake Tan.

5340
02:26:11,441 --> 02:26:11,771
You pay.

5341
02:26:11,771 --> 02:26:12,510
Really?

5342
02:26:12,510 --> 02:26:12,930
Yeah.

5343
02:26:12,930 --> 02:26:13,763
You get it figured out.

5344
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:14,311
You paid for,

5345
02:26:14,311 --> 02:26:15,380
you're an AIDS test,

5346
02:26:15,750 --> 02:26:17,080
butthole cleaning you.

5347
02:26:17,190 --> 02:26:18,620
You gotta do it yourself too.

5348
02:26:18,790 --> 02:26:19,623
Yeah.

5349
02:26:20,060 --> 02:26:20,893
What is it called

5350
02:26:23,030 --> 02:26:24,350
now you've got to take an animal to you.

5351
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:25,240
Gotta clean out your bottle.

5352
02:26:25,450 --> 02:26:30,160
Here's what I don't get is how guys are
s there's still guy porn stars because

5353
02:26:30,161 --> 02:26:30,701
you know that,

5354
02:26:30,701 --> 02:26:34,450
that that has to be like
zero money guy porn stars.

5355
02:26:34,480 --> 02:26:36,100
They must be paying them
a couple of hundred bucks.

5356
02:26:36,101 --> 02:26:37,540
At least for a lot of guys,

5357
02:26:37,541 --> 02:26:37,930
man.

5358
02:26:37,930 --> 02:26:40,840
Like I know dudes would done
porn and there was like,

5359
02:26:40,841 --> 02:26:41,081
you know,

5360
02:26:41,081 --> 02:26:43,420
I didn't want to work at
fucking Mcdonald's so I could,

5361
02:26:43,450 --> 02:26:45,100
I could do this and I can make 500 bucks.

5362
02:26:45,101 --> 02:26:45,281
Like,

5363
02:26:45,281 --> 02:26:48,880
there's just some desperate people out
there and they fucked some girls on film.

5364
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:49,773
You know,

5365
02:26:49,930 --> 02:26:50,410
Tyler,

5366
02:26:50,410 --> 02:26:52,090

5367
02:26:52,510 --> 02:26:53,380
fucking great guy.

5368
02:26:53,470 --> 02:26:55,000
Normal regular dude.

5369
02:26:55,270 --> 02:26:56,081
And he's out of the business.

5370
02:26:56,081 --> 02:26:56,211
Dot.

5371
02:26:56,211 --> 02:26:57,100
I think he's writing books,

5372
02:26:57,190 --> 02:26:57,731
writing books,

5373
02:26:57,731 --> 02:26:59,380
and he's got an actual real job job.

5374
02:26:59,490 --> 02:26:59,870
He was like,

5375
02:26:59,870 --> 02:27:00,491
what your corporate.

5376
02:27:00,491 --> 02:27:01,324
But he didn't.

5377
02:27:01,530 --> 02:27:01,960
Yeah,

5378
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:02,621
he probably has to hide.

5379
02:27:02,621 --> 02:27:03,311
They make money.

5380
02:27:03,311 --> 02:27:03,551
I mean,

5381
02:27:03,551 --> 02:27:04,384
do you make money?

5382
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:05,081
Um,

5383
02:27:05,081 --> 02:27:05,891
you know,

5384
02:27:05,891 --> 02:27:08,170
I think you make enough to pay your bills.

5385
02:27:08,290 --> 02:27:08,790
You know,

5386
02:27:08,790 --> 02:27:09,880
you can get by if you,

5387
02:27:09,900 --> 02:27:12,430
if you're live cautiously and
you'd do a lot of fucking,

5388
02:27:13,540 --> 02:27:17,200
I don't think you're getting the
ranch unless you're like a famous guy.

5389
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:18,030
You call me and go,

5390
02:27:18,030 --> 02:27:18,291
joy,

5391
02:27:18,291 --> 02:27:19,124
you busy as happened.

5392
02:27:19,150 --> 02:27:19,331
No,

5393
02:27:19,331 --> 02:27:19,751
not really.

5394
02:27:19,751 --> 02:27:20,081
What's up?

5395
02:27:20,081 --> 02:27:20,320
Listen,

5396
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:20,911
the way to come on.

5397
02:27:20,911 --> 02:27:21,880
Will you fuck this chicken?

5398
02:27:21,881 --> 02:27:22,714
Come on up phase.

5399
02:27:22,850 --> 02:27:23,860
I'll give you 500 bucks.

5400
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:25,721
That's not bad.

5401
02:27:25,721 --> 02:27:27,400
I'm gonna fucking come on somebody's face.

5402
02:27:27,730 --> 02:27:30,550
But to get fucked in the ass for $1,000,

5403
02:27:30,970 --> 02:27:31,930
that's just wrong.

5404
02:27:31,960 --> 02:27:33,310
I would want at least 10 gs.

5405
02:27:33,311 --> 02:27:34,270
15 gs.

5406
02:27:34,750 --> 02:27:34,871
Well,

5407
02:27:34,871 --> 02:27:36,190
the whole world changed.

5408
02:27:36,220 --> 02:27:36,431
You know,

5409
02:27:36,431 --> 02:27:38,920
the whole world of porn
completely changed weight.

5410
02:27:38,921 --> 02:27:40,180
When they stop selling DVDs.

5411
02:27:40,330 --> 02:27:43,030
DVD sales disappeared when
the internet came along,

5412
02:27:43,070 --> 02:27:44,110
they just disappeared.

5413
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:45,370
They dried up completely.

5414
02:27:45,510 --> 02:27:46,370
Remember when laws are,

5415
02:27:46,380 --> 02:27:51,190
WIC was saying the sky is falling because
they had figured out a way to download

5416
02:27:51,191 --> 02:27:52,120
things off the internet.

5417
02:27:52,270 --> 02:27:54,630
That was back when people
weren't even that good at it.

5418
02:27:54,880 --> 02:27:56,770
Napster file sharing and shit like that.

5419
02:27:56,980 --> 02:27:59,380
Now it's just the fucking game is over.

5420
02:27:59,590 --> 02:28:00,370
The game's over.

5421
02:28:00,370 --> 02:28:02,740
So there's no more money
in porn DVDs anymore.

5422
02:28:02,741 --> 02:28:03,574
It's probably,

5423
02:28:03,790 --> 02:28:04,330
I bet it,

5424
02:28:04,330 --> 02:28:05,020
I wouldn't,

5425
02:28:05,020 --> 02:28:09,530
I wouldn't be surprised if it diminished
by 95% people will write those.

5426
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:11,073
They used to,

5427
02:28:11,140 --> 02:28:12,260
but now nobody rents something.

5428
02:28:12,450 --> 02:28:13,580
Now they can,

5429
02:28:14,050 --> 02:28:19,050
they can sell them I guess to direct TV
and cable where you can buy videos to

5430
02:28:19,361 --> 02:28:19,691
go.

5431
02:28:19,691 --> 02:28:21,440
Cause then if you've flipped
through those late night channels,

5432
02:28:21,770 --> 02:28:22,040
it's like

5433
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:23,390
10 bucks a movie or something like that,

5434
02:28:23,391 --> 02:28:24,440
or $9 a movie.

5435
02:28:24,441 --> 02:28:24,701
And they,

5436
02:28:24,701 --> 02:28:25,580
they're always there.

5437
02:28:25,581 --> 02:28:26,780
They always have video.

5438
02:28:26,781 --> 02:28:28,220
So someone's buying content.

5439
02:28:28,490 --> 02:28:31,610
So I'm guessing they're selling
something to someone somewhere,

5440
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:35,780
but it's nothing like the roaring
twenties of porn that they had that they

5441
02:28:35,781 --> 02:28:37,880
experienced out here for a couple decades,

5442
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:38,990
for a couple of decades.

5443
02:28:38,991 --> 02:28:39,824
It was like,

5444
02:28:39,890 --> 02:28:42,380
even though it was not respectable,

5445
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:46,220
there was people that have these giant
ass fucking houses and drove Ferrari's

5446
02:28:46,370 --> 02:28:47,330
and the neighbors would be like,

5447
02:28:47,331 --> 02:28:47,421
well,

5448
02:28:47,421 --> 02:28:48,830
who's that guy always in porn?

5449
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:49,693
He's in porn.

5450
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:51,770
But it was like he was so rich,

5451
02:28:51,980 --> 02:28:54,290
he didn't candidate the scumbag
was living next door to you,

5452
02:28:54,500 --> 02:28:57,590
but this guy was like a porn guy and he
would drive front and Ferrari and he was

5453
02:28:57,591 --> 02:29:00,530
making millions and they would laugh
at all these people that weren't in the

5454
02:29:00,531 --> 02:29:01,161
porn business.

5455
02:29:01,161 --> 02:29:01,491
Listen,

5456
02:29:01,491 --> 02:29:02,540
we make it you,

5457
02:29:02,780 --> 02:29:03,530
you buy it,

5458
02:29:03,530 --> 02:29:03,981
okay,

5459
02:29:03,981 --> 02:29:04,640
I sell it.

5460
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,020
You pretend you don't buy it,

5461
02:29:06,021 --> 02:29:06,890
but you do buy.

5462
02:29:06,980 --> 02:29:08,060
And that's what my house is.

5463
02:29:08,061 --> 02:29:09,050
So big baby.

5464
02:29:09,410 --> 02:29:10,970
Well that guy doesn't exist anymore.

5465
02:29:11,060 --> 02:29:12,470
That guy doesn't exist now.

5466
02:29:12,471 --> 02:29:15,500
It's like these hustler dudes who are
like sticking a camera and a girl's

5467
02:29:15,501 --> 02:29:16,820
asshole and you know,

5468
02:29:16,821 --> 02:29:17,041
and,

5469
02:29:17,041 --> 02:29:17,241
and,

5470
02:29:17,241 --> 02:29:20,750
and filming these audition tapes
where girls could meet them in,

5471
02:29:20,751 --> 02:29:24,320
in conference rooms and they fuck them
on a couch and come in their face and

5472
02:29:24,321 --> 02:29:25,520
make them sign a waiver.

5473
02:29:25,521 --> 02:29:26,354
And it's all like,

5474
02:29:26,390 --> 02:29:26,631
you know,

5475
02:29:26,631 --> 02:29:27,710
like Gonzo style.

5476
02:29:27,711 --> 02:29:28,341
Like that's like,

5477
02:29:28,341 --> 02:29:28,750
what's,

5478
02:29:28,750 --> 02:29:30,470
that's like what's big and porn now.

5479
02:29:30,790 --> 02:29:31,780
And it's like the,

5480
02:29:31,781 --> 02:29:32,100
the,

5481
02:29:32,100 --> 02:29:36,330
the movies that they used to try to
make these try to make like porn movie.

5482
02:29:36,350 --> 02:29:36,951
He had d'evelyn.

5483
02:29:36,951 --> 02:29:38,840
Mrs. Jones was a porn movie,

5484
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:39,591
you know,

5485
02:29:39,591 --> 02:29:42,230
behind the green door
with Marilyn Chambers.

5486
02:29:42,231 --> 02:29:43,220
That was a porn movie.

5487
02:29:43,221 --> 02:29:44,960
Deep throat was a porn movie.

5488
02:29:45,470 --> 02:29:47,750
Deep throat was a porn movie.

5489
02:29:47,751 --> 02:29:52,751
People went to see it like there's a
video of a photo rather of Johnny Carson

5490
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:54,890
waiting in line to go see deep throat.

5491
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:57,020
Deep throat was a pornographic movies.

5492
02:29:57,021 --> 02:29:58,070
The chick was sucking Dicks,

5493
02:29:58,340 --> 02:30:01,310
but it was still was a movie
and it was an artistic movie.

5494
02:30:01,710 --> 02:30:01,940
You know,

5495
02:30:01,940 --> 02:30:03,350
that shit doesn't exist anymore.

5496
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:04,220
That there's no,

5497
02:30:04,250 --> 02:30:05,600
that was back then when you,

5498
02:30:05,601 --> 02:30:06,470
if you made porn,

5499
02:30:06,471 --> 02:30:07,370
it was like you're the only,

5500
02:30:07,371 --> 02:30:09,920
you have the only copy
of it to sort of get to,

5501
02:30:09,921 --> 02:30:10,820
so for someone to get it,

5502
02:30:10,821 --> 02:30:12,110
they have to get it from you.

5503
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:13,460
When you made deep throat,

5504
02:30:13,461 --> 02:30:14,780
there's only one way to get deep throat.

5505
02:30:14,781 --> 02:30:15,860
You've got to get it
from the guy who made it.

5506
02:30:15,861 --> 02:30:17,120
Is it going to make more copies of it?

5507
02:30:17,210 --> 02:30:18,043
How do I get it?

5508
02:30:18,050 --> 02:30:18,631
It didn't even exist.

5509
02:30:18,631 --> 02:30:20,210
It wasn't even a VHS tapes though.

5510
02:30:20,630 --> 02:30:23,360
You couldn't even see something
again whenever you want it to.

5511
02:30:23,450 --> 02:30:25,550
That's why when I saw star
wars when I was a little kid,

5512
02:30:25,790 --> 02:30:26,091
there was,

5513
02:30:26,091 --> 02:30:28,070
the thing was you'd go see
star wars like 10 times.

5514
02:30:28,071 --> 02:30:28,701
I saw star wars,

5515
02:30:28,701 --> 02:30:31,220
I think it was like 10 or 13 times
or something crazy like that.

5516
02:30:31,380 --> 02:30:32,330
That's what everybody did.

5517
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:33,350
You know why?

5518
02:30:33,350 --> 02:30:34,910
Because you couldn't get a DVD.

5519
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:36,350
There was no DVDs.

5520
02:30:36,351 --> 02:30:38,680
There was no vehicle was gone.

5521
02:30:38,690 --> 02:30:39,523
It was over.

5522
02:30:39,830 --> 02:30:40,550
It was over.

5523
02:30:40,550 --> 02:30:42,440
Now we're in the exact opposite.

5524
02:30:42,470 --> 02:30:46,370
Now I'm sitting here talking to
you and all I have to do is go,

5525
02:30:46,371 --> 02:30:47,150
oh yeah.

5526
02:30:47,150 --> 02:30:49,700
Well let me go to iTunes real quick.

5527
02:30:49,730 --> 02:30:53,600
What the Godfather Dick
Order and I'm getting it.

5528
02:30:53,720 --> 02:30:55,160
And then while you're talking,

5529
02:30:55,430 --> 02:30:59,060
I press play and I'm watching
the godfather that quickly.

5530
02:30:59,150 --> 02:31:00,680
I mean it's ridiculous.

5531
02:31:00,681 --> 02:31:01,514
The saturation.

5532
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:03,290
Did you go to New York?

5533
02:31:03,830 --> 02:31:04,663
Uh,

5534
02:31:04,670 --> 02:31:07,130
I started calming an 88 and I met,

5535
02:31:07,131 --> 02:31:07,760
saw spin,

5536
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:12,760
I think it was 90 I met Sosman 89 or
90 was deployed still big in New York.

5537
02:31:12,800 --> 02:31:13,640
42nd street.

5538
02:31:13,641 --> 02:31:14,020
Yeah.

5539
02:31:14,020 --> 02:31:15,350
Which they hadn't cleaned it up yet.

5540
02:31:15,900 --> 02:31:16,280
Yeah,

5541
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:16,910
it was,

5542
02:31:16,910 --> 02:31:17,743
it was scary.

5543
02:31:17,870 --> 02:31:18,441
It was a,

5544
02:31:18,441 --> 02:31:19,890
it was a dangerous world back then.

5545
02:31:19,891 --> 02:31:20,581
It was a different world.

5546
02:31:20,581 --> 02:31:21,320
The eighties,

5547
02:31:21,320 --> 02:31:22,380
42nd street was,

5548
02:31:22,390 --> 02:31:23,580
was dirty man.

5549
02:31:23,850 --> 02:31:25,770
It was like you didn't
go down there and it was,

5550
02:31:25,771 --> 02:31:26,604
it was like,

5551
02:31:26,730 --> 02:31:28,950
there was like porn theaters and it was,

5552
02:31:28,951 --> 02:31:29,171
it was,

5553
02:31:29,171 --> 02:31:30,910
it was hustlers and hookers and,

5554
02:31:31,450 --> 02:31:31,660
yeah,

5555
02:31:31,660 --> 02:31:36,660
and they have those weird signs and the
signs would like say like what dirty

5556
02:31:36,781 --> 02:31:37,770
movies plan.

5557
02:31:37,790 --> 02:31:39,300
It would be right there
as you're driving by,

5558
02:31:39,450 --> 02:31:41,130
there was a lot of them peep shows.

5559
02:31:41,131 --> 02:31:42,090
And you know,

5560
02:31:42,091 --> 02:31:45,420
and my friend Johnny used to go to
peep shows when he was on crack.

5561
02:31:45,780 --> 02:31:47,250
He said that smoking crack,

5562
02:31:47,251 --> 02:31:47,491
he goes,

5563
02:31:47,491 --> 02:31:48,324
you could never get a,

5564
02:31:48,450 --> 02:31:50,520
you could never get a hot
on but you're always horny.

5565
02:31:50,790 --> 02:31:52,800
So I'd go and he's fucking dirty pitches.

5566
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:55,380
They'd be right behind a glass
and I pay him and they'd be,

5567
02:31:55,530 --> 02:31:58,440
they'd be right in front of me with a
dirty ass and I'd be checking off and I

5568
02:31:58,441 --> 02:31:59,760
couldn't get a hot on and he goes,

5569
02:31:59,761 --> 02:32:01,350
but I'd be there all day
when I was smoking crack.

5570
02:32:01,590 --> 02:32:05,130
When he some that somehow or another
like the people that are smoking crack,

5571
02:32:05,131 --> 02:32:07,170
like they get on those heavy amphetamines,

5572
02:32:07,171 --> 02:32:07,531
smoking,

5573
02:32:07,531 --> 02:32:08,250
those things.

5574
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:09,083
They want to,

5575
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:10,920
they want to watch a lot of porn.

5576
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:13,260
That's like a big thing
from like math people.

5577
02:32:13,261 --> 02:32:15,060
Like a lot of math people
like to watch porn.

5578
02:32:15,480 --> 02:32:16,440
I guess it's cause it's just,

5579
02:32:16,441 --> 02:32:18,000
they just want to go super dirty.

5580
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:18,560
What height?

5581
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:19,393
There's just clarity.

5582
02:32:20,120 --> 02:32:21,530
You want to get your Dick sucked.

5583
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:22,291
You know,

5584
02:32:22,291 --> 02:32:22,480
like,

5585
02:32:22,480 --> 02:32:23,810
I didn't know like porn,

5586
02:32:24,140 --> 02:32:25,550
but when I lived in Aspen,

5587
02:32:25,580 --> 02:32:29,720
boulder and I would pick up chicks like
they were like porn and I'd say get it.

5588
02:32:29,750 --> 02:32:30,021
You know,

5589
02:32:30,021 --> 02:32:30,771
I'm not going to watch,

5590
02:32:30,771 --> 02:32:33,020
I'm just going to snort coke
and fucking get my dick sucked.

5591
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:34,060
When you get,

5592
02:32:34,060 --> 02:32:35,060
when you get cocaine,

5593
02:32:35,061 --> 02:32:35,840
evil,

5594
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:36,441
cocaine,

5595
02:32:36,441 --> 02:32:40,430
evil is horrible because that's how
you get your hips moving a chair.

5596
02:32:40,970 --> 02:32:42,200
Like as she's talking to you,

5597
02:32:42,201 --> 02:32:43,400
talking about sucking your Dick,

5598
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:44,151
Joe Rogan,

5599
02:32:44,151 --> 02:32:47,720
your hips start to move the way I like
my things will be gyrate and you're just

5600
02:32:47,721 --> 02:32:48,590
looking at a porno.

5601
02:32:49,030 --> 02:32:49,250
You know,

5602
02:32:49,250 --> 02:32:52,490
I've seen girls at gyrate event
chairs while they're coked up

5603
02:32:54,920 --> 02:32:56,390
like fucking like a savage,

5604
02:32:56,391 --> 02:32:57,530
like just get all fucking,

5605
02:32:57,860 --> 02:32:59,660
I like all that shit as far as,

5606
02:32:59,870 --> 02:33:00,440
let me tell you something.

5607
02:33:00,440 --> 02:33:02,300
I would make a chicken for
the chicks did something,

5608
02:33:02,320 --> 02:33:03,153
Michael,

5609
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:04,310
she was sucking my Dick.

5610
02:33:04,510 --> 02:33:05,331
Dick got hard.

5611
02:33:05,331 --> 02:33:06,164
You understand me?

5612
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:07,580
You know you get freaky.

5613
02:33:07,730 --> 02:33:09,440
You think it's things you want to do,

5614
02:33:09,441 --> 02:33:10,950
but you can't because
you've got dead Dick.

5615
02:33:12,370 --> 02:33:13,880
But why are you so freaky though?

5616
02:33:13,881 --> 02:33:14,714
If you're just,

5617
02:33:14,990 --> 02:33:15,621
I don't know.

5618
02:33:15,621 --> 02:33:16,430
You just want it.

5619
02:33:16,430 --> 02:33:16,701
It's like,

5620
02:33:16,701 --> 02:33:16,851
hey,

5621
02:33:16,851 --> 02:33:17,750
these experiences too.

5622
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:18,620
You want what?

5623
02:33:18,621 --> 02:33:20,920
You can't get you what you what?

5624
02:33:20,921 --> 02:33:21,300
What happened?

5625
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:21,561
He goes,

5626
02:33:21,561 --> 02:33:22,940
I know you had a common thing for a while.

5627
02:33:22,941 --> 02:33:23,301
What'd you,

5628
02:33:23,301 --> 02:33:24,134
what'd you get into?

5629
02:33:24,140 --> 02:33:25,140
You get hard ons when you,

5630
02:33:25,530 --> 02:33:25,841
oh,

5631
02:33:25,841 --> 02:33:26,770
I never had a problem.

5632
02:33:26,771 --> 02:33:29,020
Not Getting hard on ever
with any drug or anything.

5633
02:33:29,080 --> 02:33:30,490
I think I find it very hard to believe.

5634
02:33:30,491 --> 02:33:32,080
I think once when I was sick,

5635
02:33:32,260 --> 02:33:34,290
like I tried to masturbate
when I had like a temperature,

5636
02:33:34,300 --> 02:33:36,550
really high temperature
and I couldn't do it once.

5637
02:33:36,551 --> 02:33:37,660
When you're six you couldn't get it up.

5638
02:33:37,810 --> 02:33:39,580
What do you consider it up is you're up.

5639
02:33:39,581 --> 02:33:42,500
Like if I get black eyes draw,

5640
02:33:42,580 --> 02:33:45,440
I have a harder dick then
if I didn't have a drunk.

5641
02:33:45,590 --> 02:33:45,821
Okay,

5642
02:33:45,821 --> 02:33:46,960
next time you get black out drunk,

5643
02:33:46,961 --> 02:33:47,870
I want to take a picture of your deck.

5644
02:33:48,110 --> 02:33:48,943
I'm going to get it hard.

5645
02:33:49,930 --> 02:33:51,680
You defy the laws of physiology.

5646
02:33:51,681 --> 02:33:52,450
That doesn't even make sense.

5647
02:33:52,450 --> 02:33:52,991
I don't know.

5648
02:33:52,991 --> 02:33:54,900
I seriously like I can call it,

5649
02:33:54,910 --> 02:33:56,180
everybody has a problem.

5650
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:59,140
Not only can I have the
biggest hard on when I'm drunk.

5651
02:33:59,170 --> 02:34:02,380
I also last like stupid
and long amounts of time,

5652
02:34:02,381 --> 02:34:03,460
like an hour and a half.

5653
02:34:03,461 --> 02:34:04,121
That's normal.

5654
02:34:04,121 --> 02:34:07,480
That's because you don't feel as
much that that happens with me too,

5655
02:34:07,660 --> 02:34:09,280
but I think that's
normal when you're drunk.

5656
02:34:09,281 --> 02:34:09,500
You know,

5657
02:34:09,500 --> 02:34:09,791
we're like,

5658
02:34:09,791 --> 02:34:10,361
get off dot.

5659
02:34:10,361 --> 02:34:10,630
Good.

5660
02:34:10,630 --> 02:34:13,060
But never had not been
even such a difference,

5661
02:34:13,061 --> 02:34:13,271
man.

5662
02:34:13,271 --> 02:34:14,170
People don't smoke.

5663
02:34:14,171 --> 02:34:16,990
We don't even know her fucking feels
like when you get high with your,

5664
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:18,340
and

5665
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:19,330
you know you just,

5666
02:34:19,420 --> 02:34:21,280
especially if you really love a check,

5667
02:34:21,290 --> 02:34:22,460
you'd been there a while,

5668
02:34:22,570 --> 02:34:22,790
you,

5669
02:34:22,790 --> 02:34:23,021
you,

5670
02:34:23,021 --> 02:34:23,241
you,

5671
02:34:23,241 --> 02:34:24,370
you're like really close.

5672
02:34:24,371 --> 02:34:25,270
You're not fighting.

5673
02:34:25,271 --> 02:34:26,061
There's no bullshit.

5674
02:34:26,061 --> 02:34:26,891
There's no animosity,

5675
02:34:26,891 --> 02:34:27,724
no weirdness,

5676
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:29,440
no need,

5677
02:34:29,980 --> 02:34:31,690
no extra need.

5678
02:34:31,960 --> 02:34:35,740
That's a hovering over every
fucking conversation you have.

5679
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:37,700
It's a lot bad relationships out there,

5680
02:34:37,701 --> 02:34:38,534
Joey Diaz,

5681
02:34:38,830 --> 02:34:39,670
but if you've got a good one,

5682
02:34:39,880 --> 02:34:40,541
if you got a good one,

5683
02:34:40,541 --> 02:34:41,081
you smoke weed.

5684
02:34:41,081 --> 02:34:42,160
But the lady and my Gout,

5685
02:34:42,570 --> 02:34:43,403
I have some sex.

5686
02:34:43,890 --> 02:34:44,411
I'll tell you,

5687
02:34:44,411 --> 02:34:45,340
it's a credible,

5688
02:34:45,670 --> 02:34:46,503
it's a,

5689
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:48,160
it feels 20 times better.

5690
02:34:48,210 --> 02:34:48,431
Yeah.

5691
02:34:48,431 --> 02:34:49,450
It's like no bullshit.

5692
02:34:49,690 --> 02:34:51,630
When you get high and you
just hanging out with a chick,

5693
02:34:51,631 --> 02:34:52,810
it's so much fucking better.

5694
02:34:52,811 --> 02:34:53,650
He wasn't drinking.

5695
02:34:54,260 --> 02:34:54,610
Yeah,

5696
02:34:54,610 --> 02:34:55,570
always fucked up for me.

5697
02:34:55,571 --> 02:34:57,460
They got that fucking wine breath is shit.

5703
02:35:04,391 --> 02:35:07,060
some fucking mistakes and we're
going to do something crazy.

5704
02:35:07,240 --> 02:35:08,410
He could talk her into some shit.

5705
02:35:09,850 --> 02:35:13,810
I grew up in a ball like I like
it if you can keep it together.

5706
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:14,860
I like a good drunk.

5707
02:35:15,130 --> 02:35:16,060
I don't mind the drunk.

5708
02:35:16,090 --> 02:35:16,721
I was like a drunk.

5709
02:35:16,721 --> 02:35:17,560
They can keep it together.

5710
02:35:18,420 --> 02:35:20,860
Hanging out with a drunk tonight

5711
02:35:20,870 --> 02:35:21,650

5714
02:35:23,350 --> 02:35:25,180
Might drink tonight cause
I haven't drank in a week.

5715
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:28,630
He came on the podcast yesterday and I
was just thinking what a fucking positive

5716
02:35:28,631 --> 02:35:29,260
guy.

5717
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:29,620
You know,

5718
02:35:29,620 --> 02:35:32,380
when we were talking about this whole
desk squad thing about all of us,

5719
02:35:32,620 --> 02:35:36,070
one of the most beautiful things is the
friends that we've made and that we've

5720
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:39,220
formulated this group
of really nice people.

5721
02:35:39,221 --> 02:35:40,240
We can trust all of them.

5722
02:35:40,241 --> 02:35:40,481
You know,

5723
02:35:40,481 --> 02:35:41,261
like Bert Kreischer.

5724
02:35:41,261 --> 02:35:42,130
I trust that guy.

5725
02:35:42,160 --> 02:35:42,790
I love birds.

5726
02:35:42,790 --> 02:35:43,920

5727
02:35:43,980 --> 02:35:45,490

5728
02:35:45,490 --> 02:35:46,480
I trust him to always,

5729
02:35:46,660 --> 02:35:47,620
I always want to hug him.

5730
02:35:47,650 --> 02:35:49,150
He's always great to talk to.

5731
02:35:49,151 --> 02:35:50,560
He's a good human being.

5732
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:51,041
You know?

5733
02:35:51,041 --> 02:35:52,840
There's so many good human being,

5734
02:35:52,841 --> 02:35:53,590

5735

same way.

5736
02:35:54,100 --> 02:35:54,760
That's,

5737
02:35:54,760 --> 02:35:56,470
he's a great human being.

5738
02:35:56,500 --> 02:35:58,280

5739
02:35:58,281 --> 02:35:59,070

02:35:59,070 --> 02:35:59,621

5741
02:35:59,621 --> 02:36:00,454
Dot Brand.

5742
02:36:01,140 --> 02:36:02,140
We've made our brand,

5743
02:36:02,170 --> 02:36:04,150
we formulated our brand
and what's that from?

5744
02:36:05,140 --> 02:36:06,820
We've made our brand last Friday.

5745
02:36:06,930 --> 02:36:07,060
Yeah.

5746
02:36:07,060 --> 02:36:07,870
What was that from?

5747
02:36:07,870 --> 02:36:09,730
That was good with that kid.

5748
02:36:09,880 --> 02:36:10,151
Oh,

5749
02:36:10,151 --> 02:36:10,984
who was the show?

5750
02:36:11,410 --> 02:36:11,981
Oh yeah.

5751
02:36:11,981 --> 02:36:15,670
That guy was fucking beaten
our ear and talking nonsense.

5752
02:36:15,671 --> 02:36:17,440
Fucking showbiz terms to us.

5753
02:36:17,620 --> 02:36:18,520
We got trapped.

5754
02:36:18,850 --> 02:36:21,460
We've got trapped in a weird
conversation between you guys really have

5755
02:36:21,461 --> 02:36:22,750
established your brand.

5756
02:36:22,780 --> 02:36:22,991
You know,

5757
02:36:22,991 --> 02:36:27,310
I think you guys done an amazing job of
establishing your brand and I'm like,

5758
02:36:27,311 --> 02:36:28,480
you are speaking.

5759
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:31,353
It's crazy

5760
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:33,940
because I wish,

5761
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:38,500
I wish that everybody at one time got
to see New York City in the 80s just to

5762
02:36:38,501 --> 02:36:39,041
see that.

5763
02:36:39,041 --> 02:36:39,874
Just to see that.

5764
02:36:40,060 --> 02:36:40,631
Let me tell you something.

5765
02:36:40,631 --> 02:36:44,830
I used to go to those peep
shows as a the kill term.

5766
02:36:44,860 --> 02:36:47,040
I worked on 52nd street and I'm going to,

5767
02:36:47,050 --> 02:36:49,420
when you're 13 you go to
get to see a piece of pussy.

5768
02:36:49,810 --> 02:36:54,700
It was the Raunchy was first of all where
they hired a guy to go in there with

5769
02:36:54,701 --> 02:36:58,890
the mops cause you walk out and he's
right in there with a mop and that mob

5770
02:36:58,900 --> 02:37:00,220
picks up that load of sperm.

5771
02:37:00,221 --> 02:37:01,150
You come on the floor.

5772
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:03,100
There's no tissues in those places.

5773
02:37:03,130 --> 02:37:03,551
You know,

5774
02:37:03,551 --> 02:37:04,510
when I was a kid,

5775
02:37:04,540 --> 02:37:07,000
I fond in a really big karate tournament.

5776
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:07,990
Madison Square Garden.

5777
02:37:08,380 --> 02:37:09,580
I run banks isn't all that.

5778
02:37:09,850 --> 02:37:11,650
It was a big karate tournament.

5779
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:14,680
I was like maybe 16 I
was still in high school.

5780
02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:15,530
Walk over.

5781
02:37:15,530 --> 02:37:16,190
I don't remember.

5782
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:17,240
I don't remember much man.

5783
02:37:17,241 --> 02:37:19,850
I remember there's a lot of fights aren't
definitely got tagged in it had a few

5784
02:37:19,851 --> 02:37:20,181
times.

5785
02:37:20,181 --> 02:37:21,340
So my memory of the weekend.

5786
02:37:21,350 --> 02:37:22,520
You didn't go with the peep shows?

5787
02:37:22,580 --> 02:37:23,211
No,

5788
02:37:23,211 --> 02:37:23,481
no,

5789
02:37:23,481 --> 02:37:25,570
I didn't do any of that
back then when I was a,

5790
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:28,280
I didn't even believe
in pleasure back then.

5791
02:37:28,281 --> 02:37:29,720
I thought that if I needed pleasure,

5792
02:37:29,721 --> 02:37:33,460
I was weak when I was 16 anymore
until I got my first girlfriend.

5793
02:37:33,480 --> 02:37:34,850
Then we start fucking like Robinson.

5794
02:37:34,940 --> 02:37:35,301
Totally.

5795
02:37:35,301 --> 02:37:36,051
It was totally right.

5796
02:37:36,051 --> 02:37:38,450
Distracted the shit out
of me for a little while.

5797
02:37:38,780 --> 02:37:39,710
But I didn't,

5798
02:37:39,711 --> 02:37:40,760
I tried to avoid sex.

5799
02:37:40,761 --> 02:37:42,920
I wouldn't even fuck my girlfriend
in the school cause you know,

5800
02:37:42,921 --> 02:37:45,110
I used to teach at my martial arts school,

5801
02:37:45,230 --> 02:37:45,771
so I was gone.

5802
02:37:45,771 --> 02:37:49,610
I was in high school and I had keys to
this fucking building in downtown La,

5803
02:37:50,660 --> 02:37:51,493
Boston rather.

5804
02:37:51,590 --> 02:37:52,670
Not even downtown Boston,

5805
02:37:52,671 --> 02:37:54,380
but this is building in Boston.

5806
02:37:54,410 --> 02:37:55,191
I would teach there.

5807
02:37:55,191 --> 02:37:56,750
I mean I would go there and I also,

5808
02:37:56,751 --> 02:37:59,330
I would also like to go
there because I had a,

5809
02:37:59,390 --> 02:38:00,470
I had my car back then.

5810
02:38:00,830 --> 02:38:02,420
I would like to go there and work out.

5811
02:38:02,421 --> 02:38:03,770
When I knew that everybody was asleep,

5812
02:38:03,771 --> 02:38:06,380
I had this crazy thing
where I want it to work out.

5813
02:38:06,381 --> 02:38:09,080
When I knew that everybody
that I was finding was asleep,

5814
02:38:09,350 --> 02:38:10,820
that's when I would go
there like two o'clock,

5815
02:38:10,821 --> 02:38:11,541
three o'clock in the morning.

5816
02:38:11,541 --> 02:38:13,670
I would start my workouts and uh,

5817
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:16,190
I was dating this freak bitch
and she would go with me.

5818
02:38:16,191 --> 02:38:17,060
She wanted to fuck all the time.

5819
02:38:17,310 --> 02:38:18,620
She was dirty and she was so dirty.

5820
02:38:19,140 --> 02:38:19,700
She was,

5821
02:38:19,700 --> 02:38:20,570
I dated one,

5822
02:38:21,140 --> 02:38:22,940
I did it a few really dirty
girls when I was young,

5823
02:38:23,210 --> 02:38:24,440
but this one was just down,

5824
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:27,350
down DTF all day.

5825
02:38:27,380 --> 02:38:28,610
She was just crazy.

5826
02:38:28,790 --> 02:38:32,410
It's amazing when you first start fucking
when you're like 15 and 16 that's why

5827
02:38:32,420 --> 02:38:32,720
I go,

5828
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:33,950
I always loved that song.

5829
02:38:33,951 --> 02:38:34,760
Night moves,

5830
02:38:34,760 --> 02:38:39,740
that Bob Seger Song because that reminded
me of this check because me and this

5831
02:38:39,741 --> 02:38:43,850
chick were just awkward and we were
in love with each other supposedly.

5832
02:38:43,851 --> 02:38:45,440
But now really what it really was like,

5833
02:38:45,441 --> 02:38:50,441
we would just go on these horrendous fuck
Rampage's to try to escape our reality

5834
02:38:51,500 --> 02:38:53,000
through a relationship,

5835
02:38:53,100 --> 02:38:54,950
through intense sex.

5836
02:38:55,610 --> 02:38:56,151
And you know,

5837
02:38:56,151 --> 02:38:57,440
just the awkwardness of growing up.

5838
02:38:57,441 --> 02:38:58,640
But that night moves song,

5839
02:38:59,290 --> 02:39:01,970
I live a pussy made me get
loved back in the sixth grade.

5840
02:39:01,971 --> 02:39:02,804
Then

5841
02:39:03,620 --> 02:39:06,330
they would tell you about the six
grade we and what does this experience?

5842
02:39:06,380 --> 02:39:06,981
12,

5843
02:39:06,981 --> 02:39:08,060
right in the sixth grade.

5844
02:39:08,090 --> 02:39:08,661
How old is that?

5845
02:39:08,661 --> 02:39:10,150
I was in love with this girl in New York,

5846
02:39:10,151 --> 02:39:10,984
no reason.

5847
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:11,541
12.

5848
02:39:11,541 --> 02:39:15,310
She was a skinny little fucking Cuban
chick and a follow up downstairs.

5849
02:39:15,320 --> 02:39:18,110
The mother was hot and every
afternoon when she would say to me,

5850
02:39:18,111 --> 02:39:18,411
cause I,

5851
02:39:18,411 --> 02:39:18,770
you know,

5852
02:39:18,770 --> 02:39:20,600
I don't know why she'd go
listen like a date yet,

5853
02:39:20,930 --> 02:39:21,920
but we can't date though.

5854
02:39:21,921 --> 02:39:22,754
School ends.

5855
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:24,730
That's what my mom's is I a day boy.

5856
02:39:24,731 --> 02:39:26,330
So we had to do it and I
hung out with her brother.

5857
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:30,620
I brother would beat in like each other
and I reacted and I bring over to my

5858
02:39:30,621 --> 02:39:30,891
house.

5859
02:39:30,891 --> 02:39:32,090
I put on earth one of the fire,

5860
02:39:32,660 --> 02:39:34,490
can't hide love off the fucking,

5861
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:34,940
uh,

5862
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:39,170
the live album and we dry hump
over and over to that song.

5863
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:41,120
I would suck a little funnel to these.

5864
02:39:41,500 --> 02:39:45,620
And finally they had those little
funnel to these in the sixth grade.

5865
02:39:45,860 --> 02:39:48,410
The best was my mother hated
when she would be in the room,

5866
02:39:48,950 --> 02:39:49,970
like my mother would come home and go,

5867
02:39:49,971 --> 02:39:51,230
what the fuck is she doing here?

5868
02:39:51,231 --> 02:39:55,290
We'll open the respect me
and I'm going to come on.

5869
02:39:55,500 --> 02:39:55,630
Yeah.

5870
02:39:55,630 --> 02:39:57,260
What was the open numb room shit.

5871
02:39:57,261 --> 02:40:01,130
And one day my mother paid one of the
guys from the bar to go over there and get

5872
02:40:01,131 --> 02:40:01,964
a ladder.

5873
02:40:02,390 --> 02:40:03,141
My mother and her,

5874
02:40:03,141 --> 02:40:03,350
I'm,

5875
02:40:03,350 --> 02:40:06,660
I'm dry humping the girl and I'm
hearing this shit in my backyard,

5876
02:40:06,740 --> 02:40:07,041
but I'm like,

5877
02:40:07,041 --> 02:40:07,761
I'm going to give a fuck.

5878
02:40:07,761 --> 02:40:12,110
I'm trying on this bench drunk and I'm
talking like I'm in this bitch dog,

5879
02:40:12,440 --> 02:40:13,110
dog,

5880
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:13,471
dog.

5881
02:40:13,471 --> 02:40:14,130
And all of a sudden I hear,

5882
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:14,963
ah,

5883
02:40:15,570 --> 02:40:19,860
my mother paid the guy like 50 bucks to
get a ladder and tele what we were doing

5884
02:40:19,861 --> 02:40:20,694
in there.

5885
02:40:20,820 --> 02:40:21,471
But the latter,

5886
02:40:21,471 --> 02:40:22,304
it felt,

5887
02:40:23,880 --> 02:40:24,140
yeah,

5888
02:40:24,140 --> 02:40:25,020
take it to the hospital.

5889
02:40:25,021 --> 02:40:26,010
He broke like a finger,

5890
02:40:26,090 --> 02:40:27,340
broke the phone off the ladders.

5891
02:40:27,500 --> 02:40:28,830
No Pussy Bro.

5892
02:40:28,831 --> 02:40:32,070
But the first time like it was like
she told me I couldn't kiss her.

5893
02:40:32,310 --> 02:40:34,030
Like we couldn't make out of shit tool.

5894
02:40:34,140 --> 02:40:38,220
But this is crazy because we weren't
going to make out to the day after school,

5895
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:41,970
but she was gonna let me lick a little
pussy and I remember the first time I

5896
02:40:41,971 --> 02:40:46,260
smelled this pussy I was like in the
sixth grade I fucking just went numb.

5897
02:40:46,261 --> 02:40:47,340
It was like my ears,

5898
02:40:47,610 --> 02:40:50,010
you know before Michael Quality
only shoots shoots a lot.

5899
02:40:50,011 --> 02:40:53,010
So how the train but it's
really his deafness from your,

5900
02:40:53,220 --> 02:40:53,850
your your,

5901
02:40:53,850 --> 02:40:55,110
I didn't know Joe Rogan.

5902
02:40:55,111 --> 02:40:58,830
My head was hot and it
would just lick my hand.

5903
02:40:58,831 --> 02:40:59,820
Did it smell like this?

5904
02:40:59,821 --> 02:41:01,250
Your face gets all red number.

5905
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:05,670
The first time you fuck face would get
red day and I'm going eat up pussy and I

5906
02:41:05,671 --> 02:41:07,560
was done dog don.

5907
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:09,360
I didn't eat a pussy every fucking day.

5908
02:41:09,900 --> 02:41:13,050
And that's what you did every
day I talk her into coming over.

5909
02:41:13,260 --> 02:41:17,940
Do you think that started your worldwide
post lifelong obsession with pussy?

5910
02:41:17,960 --> 02:41:18,381
Pussy?

5911
02:41:18,381 --> 02:41:18,840
Nah,

5912
02:41:18,840 --> 02:41:19,560
there's one girl.

5913
02:41:19,560 --> 02:41:20,360
It sounds like it is.

5914
02:41:20,360 --> 02:41:21,240
It sounds like it's a positive.

5915
02:41:21,360 --> 02:41:22,193
I won't

5916
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:24,280
stop.

5917
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:25,440
I was in the sixth grade,

5918
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:29,130
I was in the sixth grade and then what
happened was we got caught playing hooky,

5919
02:41:29,131 --> 02:41:33,090
so it was like a endless love by parents
told us we couldn't hang out with each

5920
02:41:33,091 --> 02:41:33,631
other no more.

5921
02:41:33,631 --> 02:41:34,470
It was fucking crazy.

5922
02:41:34,471 --> 02:41:37,830
I was going to burn the house down and
everything and then I got sent to summer

5923
02:41:37,831 --> 02:41:39,240
school because I wouldn't do homework.

5924
02:41:39,241 --> 02:41:39,391
Right.

5925
02:41:39,391 --> 02:41:40,350
That's all I would think about.

5926
02:41:40,640 --> 02:41:43,830
She would eat her til six I would go
home and eat dinner and then we'd get on

5927
02:41:43,831 --> 02:41:45,540
the phone till two in the morning.

5928
02:41:45,540 --> 02:41:45,811
You know,

5929
02:41:45,811 --> 02:41:47,950
it was fucking Donny and Marie type shit.

5930
02:41:48,400 --> 02:41:49,233
You know?

5931
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:50,040
I didn't know.

5932
02:41:50,040 --> 02:41:52,290
Our parents didn't let us
hang out and I got thrown.

5933
02:41:52,291 --> 02:41:56,250
I was supposed to get to summer school
at eight 30 so in fact I had to go over

5934
02:41:56,251 --> 02:42:00,120
there instead to eat her pussy because
by that time she let me stick it in there

5935
02:42:00,130 --> 02:42:02,950
a little bit fingers and I
would go fingers and like,

5936
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:03,531
well no.

5937
02:42:03,531 --> 02:42:04,740
Well she's touching your Dick at all.

5938
02:42:04,830 --> 02:42:05,670
No,

5939
02:42:05,730 --> 02:42:08,480
I didn't know I was such a
Catholic little fag prude.

5940
02:42:08,490 --> 02:42:10,010
Then really want to touch him.

5941
02:42:10,020 --> 02:42:10,853
My Dick,

5942
02:42:11,400 --> 02:42:11,881
my Dick.

5943
02:42:11,881 --> 02:42:13,050
I didn't want her in my life.

5944
02:42:13,080 --> 02:42:15,060
Did you get boners I got boaters.

5945
02:42:15,061 --> 02:42:15,930
I got big dicks.

5946
02:42:15,931 --> 02:42:16,681
I wanted to fuck.

5947
02:42:16,681 --> 02:42:17,560
But yeah,

5948
02:42:18,300 --> 02:42:20,370
those days and when I
was from the aid Lewis,

5949
02:42:20,371 --> 02:42:24,690
I got to tell you some guys from the age
of 12 to about 17 if a girl grabbed my

5950
02:42:24,691 --> 02:42:25,440
dick,

5951
02:42:25,440 --> 02:42:27,690
I told her get dressed and leave real.

5952
02:42:27,690 --> 02:42:29,280
I was one of those fucking mobiles,

5953
02:42:29,300 --> 02:42:30,540
like I didn't want blow jobs.

5954
02:42:30,541 --> 02:42:31,740
Like I was looking for a wife.

5955
02:42:32,160 --> 02:42:32,860
Really?

5956
02:42:32,860 --> 02:42:33,900
I'm looking for a woman.

5957
02:42:34,290 --> 02:42:34,951
I don't want to check.

5958
02:42:34,951 --> 02:42:35,850
That sucks my Dick,

5959
02:42:35,851 --> 02:42:36,191
that bitch,

5960
02:42:36,191 --> 02:42:37,024
she's a whore.

5961
02:42:37,290 --> 02:42:40,050
And then first time I got my dick sucked,

5962
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:40,953
bonafide.

5963
02:42:41,130 --> 02:42:42,450
My Buddy Louie Denato,

5964
02:42:42,451 --> 02:42:43,280
I still remember him.

5965
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:43,711
He's like,

5966
02:42:43,711 --> 02:42:44,310
dog,

5967
02:42:44,310 --> 02:42:45,450
I got this massage place.

5968
02:42:45,451 --> 02:42:47,400
You got to come up and
help me do security.

5969
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:48,930
Like I made team dog.

5970
02:42:49,380 --> 02:42:49,671
I'm like,

5971
02:42:49,671 --> 02:42:49,750
oh,

5972
02:42:49,750 --> 02:42:50,581
how much are you going to pay me?

5973
02:42:50,581 --> 02:42:50,791
He's like,

5974
02:42:50,791 --> 02:42:51,481
I can't pay them,

5975
02:42:51,481 --> 02:42:52,051
but I have to check.

5976
02:42:52,051 --> 02:42:52,884
Suck your Dick.

5977
02:42:53,070 --> 02:42:54,240
So I just wanted a blow job,

5978
02:42:54,241 --> 02:42:55,230
so I didn't tell him the truth.

5979
02:42:55,231 --> 02:42:55,980
I went up there with that.

5980
02:42:55,980 --> 02:42:57,090
I'll do security dog.

5981
02:42:57,420 --> 02:42:59,190
I stood there like one of the
chicks and the suck your Dick.

5982
02:42:59,191 --> 02:43:00,024
He goes whenever you want.

5983
02:43:00,330 --> 02:43:01,650
So it's chick took me in the back.

5984
02:43:01,651 --> 02:43:02,170
She had low,

5985
02:43:02,170 --> 02:43:03,630
I never forget that she sucked my Dick.

5986
02:43:04,020 --> 02:43:04,441
Then she goes,

5987
02:43:04,441 --> 02:43:05,970
you could cut my hair dog.

5988
02:43:06,140 --> 02:43:07,740
I left there fucking mummified.

5989
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:09,060
He's like,

5990
02:43:09,060 --> 02:43:09,870
he's like,

5991
02:43:09,870 --> 02:43:10,191
go ahead.

5992
02:43:10,191 --> 02:43:11,650
You got to work the door for a few hours.

5993
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:12,490
Went home.

5994
02:43:12,490 --> 02:43:16,000
It took like three showers
and a Hottie I commit a crime.

5995
02:43:16,001 --> 02:43:16,361
Like Bro,

5996
02:43:16,361 --> 02:43:17,490
when I was a young guy,

5997
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:18,340
I was a prude.

5998
02:43:18,340 --> 02:43:19,470
I was very prudish.

5999
02:43:19,620 --> 02:43:20,470
Did come in there.

6000
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:21,873
Oh yeah,

6001
02:43:24,070 --> 02:43:28,120
I'm not that much of a fruit was somebody
lets you come the hand and it's their

6002
02:43:28,121 --> 02:43:28,954
idea.

6003
02:43:29,470 --> 02:43:30,160
What the fuck.

6004
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:31,330
You know I'm coming again.

6005
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:32,530
But I didn't like it.

6006
02:43:32,531 --> 02:43:33,161
Like I said to him,

6007
02:43:33,161 --> 02:43:34,270
I really didn't like that stuff.

6008
02:43:34,300 --> 02:43:34,990
I don't know why.

6009
02:43:34,990 --> 02:43:35,823
I don't even know why.

6010
02:43:36,130 --> 02:43:36,970
It was really weird.

6011
02:43:36,971 --> 02:43:37,780
I was uh,

6012
02:43:37,780 --> 02:43:42,340
I was approved to a fucking a long time
dog then I didn't give a fuck what you

6013
02:43:42,341 --> 02:43:43,450
probably saw vice,

6014
02:43:43,540 --> 02:43:45,550
he saw so much vice as a kid.

6015
02:43:45,551 --> 02:43:47,080
You saw so many things
that you would like,

6016
02:43:47,320 --> 02:43:49,480
I'm going to avoid all these problems.

6017
02:43:49,481 --> 02:43:51,640
I'm going to avoid all this
shit that I see around me.

6018
02:43:51,640 --> 02:43:52,660
I see chaos,

6019
02:43:52,661 --> 02:43:53,830
I see death,

6020
02:43:53,831 --> 02:43:54,910
I see loss.

6021
02:43:55,090 --> 02:43:56,350
I'm going to avoid all this vice.

6022
02:43:56,351 --> 02:43:57,280
That's the only thing that makes sense.

6023
02:43:57,281 --> 02:43:58,600
If you didn't want a
girl touching your Dick,

6024
02:43:58,660 --> 02:44:03,100
you obviously rejecting the fucking suck.

6025
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:04,090
And it was my,

6026
02:44:04,091 --> 02:44:04,924
I was the captain,

6027
02:44:05,590 --> 02:44:07,510
but then I was a captain.

6028
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:09,490
He didn't want them to
touch your dick at all,

6029
02:44:09,491 --> 02:44:10,870
but he didn't do anything to them.

6030
02:44:10,900 --> 02:44:13,150
Like what are you worried
about doing something?

6031
02:44:13,151 --> 02:44:13,481
Like what?

6032
02:44:13,481 --> 02:44:14,370
What were you worried about?

6033
02:44:14,371 --> 02:44:16,150
Like what was it about
that they were dirty.

6034
02:44:16,151 --> 02:44:16,970
If they touch my,

6035
02:44:16,970 --> 02:44:18,370
like if a woman grabbed your dick,

6036
02:44:18,371 --> 02:44:19,204
she was dirty.

6037
02:44:19,420 --> 02:44:20,320
She was crazy.

6038
02:44:20,500 --> 02:44:23,380
You know how like people would all
smoke pot and look at people smoke pot.

6039
02:44:24,450 --> 02:44:25,630
They see a hallucination.

6040
02:44:26,260 --> 02:44:27,160
They see the devil.

6041
02:44:27,630 --> 02:44:28,210
That's what I,

6042
02:44:28,210 --> 02:44:30,340
I've had some conversations
with really rational people.

6043
02:44:30,520 --> 02:44:30,840
No,

6044
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:31,660
so I've had that.

6045
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:34,180
We tell him you smoke
pot and they blow a fuse.

6046
02:44:34,180 --> 02:44:35,470
Like they don't know how
to talk to you anymore.

6047
02:44:35,471 --> 02:44:37,240
You see like the hiccup in their system,

6048
02:44:38,480 --> 02:44:39,560
what smoke pot

6049
02:44:41,310 --> 02:44:42,280
grow years later,

6050
02:44:42,281 --> 02:44:43,010
bro,

6051
02:44:43,010 --> 02:44:45,040
me and that girl became
really good friends,

6052
02:44:45,220 --> 02:44:47,310
that girl that we would dry
humping and she's right.

6053
02:44:47,320 --> 02:44:48,153
You know,

6054
02:44:48,390 --> 02:44:49,120
and uh,

6055
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:51,190
I think like two years later
we became good friends.

6056
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:52,840
We were fucking backyard buddies.

6057
02:44:52,841 --> 02:44:53,081
You know,

6058
02:44:53,081 --> 02:44:53,440
we had,

6059
02:44:53,440 --> 02:44:57,910
we shared a backyard and I had a friend
of mine who stole bicycles and he would

6060
02:44:57,911 --> 02:44:58,870
always put them together and go,

6061
02:44:58,871 --> 02:44:59,110
hey,

6062
02:44:59,110 --> 02:44:59,710
come in,

6063
02:44:59,710 --> 02:45:00,940
drive this for a couple of days,

6064
02:45:00,941 --> 02:45:01,810
let me know what you think.

6065
02:45:02,190 --> 02:45:02,861
And you drive.

6066
02:45:02,861 --> 02:45:03,581
And they come back and go,

6067
02:45:03,581 --> 02:45:03,830
you know,

6068
02:45:03,830 --> 02:45:05,020
steering wheels fucked up.

6069
02:45:05,230 --> 02:45:06,250
You got to tighten or whatever.

6070
02:45:06,251 --> 02:45:08,740
He was a mechanic so he took,

6071
02:45:08,741 --> 02:45:09,580
gave me this tense Pete,

6072
02:45:09,581 --> 02:45:09,971
when he goes,

6073
02:45:09,971 --> 02:45:11,220
bro taken taken,

6074
02:45:11,230 --> 02:45:12,130
let me know what your fixed.

6075
02:45:12,131 --> 02:45:12,740
So I take it,

6076
02:45:12,740 --> 02:45:14,950
I'm playing and we was a bunch of kids.

6077
02:45:15,010 --> 02:45:16,960
I was in the seventh grade
cause I got left back.

6078
02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:18,490
She was now in the eighth grade.

6079
02:45:18,491 --> 02:45:20,560
I was the eighth grade
and she was a freshman.

6080
02:45:20,620 --> 02:45:21,453
That's what it was.

6081
02:45:21,730 --> 02:45:23,890
And we were all playing
on the same block and uh,

6082
02:45:24,310 --> 02:45:25,180
she took the bike.

6083
02:45:25,870 --> 02:45:26,381
Somebody said,

6084
02:45:26,381 --> 02:45:27,011
go to the store.

6085
02:45:27,011 --> 02:45:27,850
She threw the pack and I go,

6086
02:45:27,851 --> 02:45:28,684
where's the bag?

6087
02:45:28,810 --> 02:45:29,680
And they sit in New York.

6088
02:45:29,681 --> 02:45:30,041
It took it,

6089
02:45:30,041 --> 02:45:31,060
she's going to the store.

6090
02:45:31,330 --> 02:45:33,100
This was a block that was circular.

6091
02:45:33,160 --> 02:45:34,030
What do you call those blocks?

6092
02:45:34,090 --> 02:45:35,470
Culta sacs called the sex.

6093
02:45:35,471 --> 02:45:36,880
And the middle has like an island.

6094
02:45:36,970 --> 02:45:37,770
Yes.

6095
02:45:37,770 --> 02:45:41,650
So I was on one side of the street playing
to win football and she was riding a

6096
02:45:41,651 --> 02:45:42,484
bike this way.

6097
02:45:42,760 --> 02:45:46,060
So me and my friends
started running at her bro.

6098
02:45:46,090 --> 02:45:47,500
The steering is loose,

6099
02:45:47,980 --> 02:45:50,140
but she thought we were
going to fucking chase her.

6100
02:45:50,830 --> 02:45:51,101
Right?

6101
02:45:51,101 --> 02:45:52,840
Like we were chasing and
take the bike away from.

6102
02:45:52,860 --> 02:45:53,111
I'm like,

6103
02:45:53,111 --> 02:45:53,271
no,

6104
02:45:53,271 --> 02:45:54,130
I'll take the bike.

6105
02:45:54,430 --> 02:45:55,540
But the student was loose,

6106
02:45:55,541 --> 02:45:56,374
don't make a turn.

6107
02:45:56,430 --> 02:45:57,310
But she's giggling,

6108
02:45:57,400 --> 02:45:58,233
Bro.

6109
02:45:59,450 --> 02:45:59,790
The fuck.

6110
02:45:59,790 --> 02:46:01,150
And she went to make the turn.

6111
02:46:01,151 --> 02:46:02,020
She flew over,

6112
02:46:02,021 --> 02:46:03,100
it landed,

6113
02:46:03,101 --> 02:46:04,000
we got up,

6114
02:46:04,330 --> 02:46:05,163
she went home.

6115
02:46:05,830 --> 02:46:07,720
The next day I walked to
school and they're like,

6116
02:46:07,721 --> 02:46:08,510
come in for a second.

6117
02:46:08,510 --> 02:46:09,360
Remember your girlfriend?

6118
02:46:09,361 --> 02:46:10,400
She's in critical condition.

6119
02:46:10,910 --> 02:46:13,460
She landed on her head and got a
blood clot in the middle of five note.

6120
02:46:13,610 --> 02:46:14,210
Ah,

6121
02:46:14,210 --> 02:46:15,260
she had a shave her head.

6122
02:46:15,320 --> 02:46:16,940
Let me tell you how good
looking this girl was.

6123
02:46:17,450 --> 02:46:20,540
She still won homecoming queen
with the ball fucking handle.

6124
02:46:20,930 --> 02:46:21,591
So what'd they do?

6125
02:46:21,591 --> 02:46:23,370
They have to open our open the skull.

6126
02:46:23,390 --> 02:46:26,570
And the weird thing was that she was
always flat chest and after I bumped her

6127
02:46:26,571 --> 02:46:26,980
head,

6128
02:46:26,980 --> 02:46:29,600
her kids got gigantic.

6129
02:46:29,860 --> 02:46:31,100
I bumped to the head,

6130
02:46:31,101 --> 02:46:31,934
made her tick,

6131
02:46:32,090 --> 02:46:35,120
but it was really bad because our
families were mad at each other.

6132
02:46:35,180 --> 02:46:37,500
And I remember one day her
brother was like a dick.

6133
02:46:37,501 --> 02:46:39,900
He didn't like me and him
and his father came home.

6134
02:46:39,901 --> 02:46:41,390
My house like to talk to me,

6135
02:46:41,660 --> 02:46:43,100
but my stepfather was in the yard.

6136
02:46:43,101 --> 02:46:46,550
That's the first time I seen him
pull a gun on somebody in Jersey.

6137
02:46:46,551 --> 02:46:48,800
Like I never seen him pull
a gun on somebody in Jersey.

6138
02:46:49,220 --> 02:46:50,600
That's the time he went
out there and he goes,

6139
02:46:50,601 --> 02:46:55,130
check with that 45 these motherfuckers
got back and they called back and they

6140
02:46:55,131 --> 02:46:58,910
turned around cause they knew my
dad had a reputation but not jersey.

6141
02:46:58,911 --> 02:47:00,070
He was like nine jerseys.

6142
02:47:00,080 --> 02:47:00,621
His house,

6143
02:47:00,621 --> 02:47:01,610
he didn't want any problems.

6144
02:47:01,880 --> 02:47:04,940
He would hide his guns in his yard
so they wouldn't be in his house.

6145
02:47:05,210 --> 02:47:09,500
We were out there mowed the lawn and
also we've seen the white corvette bro.

6146
02:47:09,501 --> 02:47:10,131
And I go dad,

6147
02:47:10,131 --> 02:47:10,964
that's the guy.

6148
02:47:11,360 --> 02:47:12,230
New Yorker reasons.

6149
02:47:12,231 --> 02:47:12,560
Father.

6150
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:13,490
My Dad looked at me,

6151
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:14,630
even hesitate.

6152
02:47:14,631 --> 02:47:15,680
He just went right over.

6153
02:47:16,070 --> 02:47:17,540
He lived a Martin Scorsese movie.

6154
02:47:17,541 --> 02:47:18,140
Dude,

6155
02:47:18,140 --> 02:47:19,240
that was fucking crazy.

6156
02:47:19,300 --> 02:47:22,580
It would be a good Martin
Scorsese movie to Martin.

6157
02:47:22,850 --> 02:47:23,540
Get on it.

6158
02:47:23,540 --> 02:47:24,373
By the way,

6159
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:26,750

6160
02:47:26,900 --> 02:47:30,500
Holla at me calculate cause tonight
motherfucker tonight it's almost sold out

6161
02:47:30,530 --> 02:47:32,150
the ice house in Pasadena.

6162
02:47:32,360 --> 02:47:36,080
It is going to be a God damn
spectacular extravaganza of a show.

6163
02:47:36,170 --> 02:47:38,270
We got Randy Lipkey is hosting this bitch.

6164
02:47:38,360 --> 02:47:40,820
We got Tom Rhodes all
up in this motherfucker.

6165
02:47:40,940 --> 02:47:44,330
We got Dom Arrera Holla at your boy.

6166
02:47:44,540 --> 02:47:45,980
We got Sam Tripoli,

6167
02:47:45,981 --> 02:47:47,600
we got Brian Red band.

6168
02:47:47,660 --> 02:47:48,110
Who else?

6169
02:47:48,110 --> 02:47:50,560
Doug Benson Benson's
all up in this chamber.

6170
02:47:50,700 --> 02:47:53,360
Chrysler Kreischer nab up deck.

6171
02:47:53,370 --> 02:47:54,450
They don't want to draw that.

6172
02:47:54,451 --> 02:47:55,400
Bird's got a car.

6173
02:47:55,680 --> 02:48:00,110
Burke takes a fucking car service
so he can just throw down and me.

6174
02:48:00,410 --> 02:48:01,790
So we're all up there tonight.

6175
02:48:01,850 --> 02:48:02,091
Yeah.

6176
02:48:02,091 --> 02:48:03,800
That's like an insane lineup.

6177
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:06,260
A tremendous lineup for
15 bucks or 15 bucks.

6178
02:48:06,261 --> 02:48:07,620
And we got three fucking shows.

6179
02:48:07,621 --> 02:48:08,091
And by the way,

6180
02:48:08,091 --> 02:48:10,070
we do it all the time
and it's fun as fuck.

6181
02:48:10,071 --> 02:48:10,820
And we love it.

6182
02:48:10,820 --> 02:48:13,130
We love doing shows there in Pasadena.

6183
02:48:13,131 --> 02:48:17,030
And when Joey and I have a big show
this weekend in Denver at the paramount

6184
02:48:17,031 --> 02:48:17,570
theater,

6185
02:48:17,570 --> 02:48:19,280
these shows get us fired up for it.

6186
02:48:19,281 --> 02:48:20,150
This is like a,

6187
02:48:20,151 --> 02:48:21,140
this is how you tune in.

6188
02:48:21,141 --> 02:48:21,550
And he's like,

6189
02:48:21,550 --> 02:48:21,760
two,

6190
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:23,600
not last week was fucking incredible,

6191
02:48:23,601 --> 02:48:24,170
man.

6192
02:48:24,170 --> 02:48:25,790
It was fucking so was the Improv man.

6193
02:48:25,791 --> 02:48:27,530
The improv was fucking incredible.

6194
02:48:27,830 --> 02:48:31,100
That Friday night was amazing
and Amy Schumer was great too.

6195
02:48:31,220 --> 02:48:32,053
She was awesome.

6196
02:48:32,180 --> 02:48:32,811
She was awesome.

6197
02:48:32,811 --> 02:48:33,790
Blow fucking that.

6198
02:48:34,790 --> 02:48:35,960
I couldn't get them till the end.

6199
02:48:35,961 --> 02:48:37,100
They didn't like me in the beginning.

6200
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:37,640
Really.

6201
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:39,630
They weren't our regular people really.

6202
02:48:40,190 --> 02:48:42,590
That clubs kind of uncomfortable for me.

6203
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:43,783
I always do.

6204
02:48:46,190 --> 02:48:47,023
That's so cool.

6205
02:48:48,080 --> 02:48:48,711
You know what it is?

6206
02:48:48,711 --> 02:48:48,981
You,

6207
02:48:48,981 --> 02:48:49,300
uh,

6208
02:48:49,300 --> 02:48:49,531
you,

6209
02:48:49,531 --> 02:48:50,600
you start off first.

6210
02:48:50,630 --> 02:48:52,070
So going up first is always harder.

6211
02:48:52,100 --> 02:48:53,510
Going up first is a weird thing.

6212
02:48:53,511 --> 02:48:55,280
You gotta gotta get them in the groove.

6213
02:48:55,281 --> 02:48:57,230
They're not asked me.

6214
02:48:57,500 --> 02:48:58,550
I went up there to fight.

6215
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:00,230
He was sick and he was sick.

6216
02:49:00,231 --> 02:49:03,860
Then I will get too fast and try to
be thinking about the last set you had

6217
02:49:03,861 --> 02:49:04,280
there.

6218
02:49:04,280 --> 02:49:04,551
Oh No.

6219
02:49:04,551 --> 02:49:08,250
I have my news because of that club
and because of my last set there.

6220
02:49:08,251 --> 02:49:08,641
I have it.

6221
02:49:08,641 --> 02:49:10,140
10 minutes of clean material now.

6222
02:49:10,710 --> 02:49:11,390
Well that's good.

6223
02:49:11,390 --> 02:49:11,670
Yeah.

6224
02:49:11,670 --> 02:49:13,470
You should always have just tools.

6225
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:13,680
Yeah.

6226
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:15,360
You can just whip out
there that in the back.

6227
02:49:15,930 --> 02:49:16,920
It's not even just,

6228
02:49:16,921 --> 02:49:17,940
there's still no you,

6229
02:49:17,941 --> 02:49:18,241
you like,

6230
02:49:18,241 --> 02:49:22,140
your comedy is so weird and if
someone knows you then it makes sense.

6231
02:49:22,440 --> 02:49:24,960
But it's like there's so many
comics that that's the case.

6232
02:49:24,960 --> 02:49:26,310
Like when someone like,

6233
02:49:26,630 --> 02:49:27,930
not that you're Mitch Hedberg,

6234
02:49:28,110 --> 02:49:30,210
Mitch Hedberg used to
bomb all the fucking time.

6235
02:49:30,211 --> 02:49:31,044
If people didn't know him,

6236
02:49:31,050 --> 02:49:33,780
then once they knew him then
people would come to see it.

6237
02:49:34,050 --> 02:49:34,411
You know?

6238
02:49:34,411 --> 02:49:35,910
But you're a fucking Weirdo dude.

6239
02:49:35,911 --> 02:49:38,810
And people don't know why you're throwing
calm on the wall and a hotel room like

6240
02:49:38,820 --> 02:49:40,110
the fuck is this idiot doing.

6241
02:49:40,320 --> 02:49:41,340
It doesn't even make sense.

6242
02:49:41,370 --> 02:49:41,581
You know,

6243
02:49:41,581 --> 02:49:42,480
you're a grown man.

6244
02:49:42,481 --> 02:49:44,120
You're not 12 years old and you know,

6245
02:49:44,130 --> 02:49:45,690
like saying some cutesy Shit,

6246
02:49:45,691 --> 02:49:48,780
you're almost 40 and you're talking about
throwing loads like Spiderman on the

6247
02:49:48,870 --> 02:49:50,430
wall and people are like,

6248
02:49:50,431 --> 02:49:51,960
what the fuck are you doing?

6249
02:49:52,230 --> 02:49:52,950
You know what I'm saying?

6250
02:49:52,950 --> 02:49:54,840
So until they know you from the podcast,

6251
02:49:54,841 --> 02:49:55,950
that's a tough pill to swallow,

6252
02:49:55,951 --> 02:49:56,784
son.

6253
02:49:56,840 --> 02:49:57,481
Once they know you,

6254
02:49:57,481 --> 02:49:57,960
they're like,

6255
02:49:57,960 --> 02:49:58,051
oh,

6256
02:49:58,051 --> 02:49:58,950
silly red fan.

6257
02:49:59,790 --> 02:50:00,010
Oh,

6258
02:50:00,010 --> 02:50:00,540
silly.

6259
02:50:00,540 --> 02:50:05,190
And also tonight we have the icehouse
chronicles that goes off about tenish.

6260
02:50:05,670 --> 02:50:08,760
We usually do it about a half an hour
before the podcast and if you want to tune

6261
02:50:08,761 --> 02:50:09,240
into that,

6262
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:13,180
it's going to be right here on this
motherfucker right here on this Ustream

6263
02:50:13,260 --> 02:50:13,561
channel,

6264
02:50:13,561 --> 02:50:14,550
bitches or Brian.

6265
02:50:14,551 --> 02:50:16,920
You got to rename these all
these to say Joe Rogan live.

6266
02:50:16,921 --> 02:50:18,300
I thought you were going
to go back and rename me.

6267
02:50:18,301 --> 02:50:19,680
So that would take forever.

6268
02:50:19,710 --> 02:50:19,981
Yeah,

6269
02:50:19,981 --> 02:50:20,701
well got to do that,

6270
02:50:20,701 --> 02:50:20,970
dude.

6271
02:50:20,970 --> 02:50:21,560
You got to do that,

6272
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:21,711
right?

6273
02:50:21,711 --> 02:50:26,520
I can't just have Joe Rogan live
and not know these is used stream.

6274
02:50:26,850 --> 02:50:30,100
A lot of people do these Vimeo or youtube,

6275
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:31,020
they use this too.

6276
02:50:31,080 --> 02:50:31,241
Yeah,

6277
02:50:31,241 --> 02:50:32,100
I know what I'm saying,

6278
02:50:32,101 --> 02:50:32,780
but do you know,

6279
02:50:32,780 --> 02:50:37,780
they may not know why the amount of people
that rewatch it on Ustream instead of

6280
02:50:37,801 --> 02:50:42,801
youtube or Vimeo is like
1.0007% that's not true.

6281
02:50:43,410 --> 02:50:43,860
Not only,

6282
02:50:43,860 --> 02:50:44,850
not only is that not true,

6283
02:50:44,851 --> 02:50:45,511
you don't know.

6284
02:50:45,511 --> 02:50:48,420
And there's a lot of people that
take clips off of these things.

6285
02:50:49,020 --> 02:50:50,510
It's hard for them to find what the,

6286
02:50:50,520 --> 02:50:51,353
what the um,

6287
02:50:51,630 --> 02:50:51,841
no,

6288
02:50:51,841 --> 02:50:52,650
it's not off youtube.

6289
02:50:52,650 --> 02:50:53,011
It's all,

6290
02:50:53,011 --> 02:50:54,030
it's also when you stream,

6291
02:50:54,240 --> 02:50:55,410
a lot of them have a lot of use,

6292
02:50:55,411 --> 02:50:56,050
man.

6293
02:50:56,050 --> 02:50:57,270
A lot of these have a lot of views.

6294
02:50:57,360 --> 02:50:57,631
I know.

6295
02:50:57,631 --> 02:51:00,150
And it happens before it goes up on Vimeo.

6296
02:51:00,180 --> 02:51:01,110
Once it's on Vimeo,

6297
02:51:01,140 --> 02:51:02,190
that the amount of people,

6298
02:51:02,250 --> 02:51:03,750
once it's on Vimeo and Youtube,

6299
02:51:04,020 --> 02:51:05,130
like 0.0,

6300
02:51:05,470 --> 02:51:05,911
that's all good.

6301
02:51:05,911 --> 02:51:07,260
But it's still has thousands of views.

6302
02:51:07,410 --> 02:51:07,621
Yeah,

6303
02:51:07,621 --> 02:51:08,820
because it happens before.

6304
02:51:08,850 --> 02:51:09,331
But Brian,

6305
02:51:09,331 --> 02:51:10,120
that's happening right now.

6306
02:51:10,120 --> 02:51:11,100
Still need to be labeled.

6307
02:51:11,220 --> 02:51:12,053
They need to be late.

6308
02:51:12,560 --> 02:51:13,740
We talked about this before.

6309
02:51:13,741 --> 02:51:15,210
You can't just not label them.

6310
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:16,200
That's just crazy.

6311
02:51:16,890 --> 02:51:17,270
What?

6312
02:51:17,270 --> 02:51:18,091
What should happen is,

6313
02:51:18,091 --> 02:51:20,710
is when I label it at
the end of every podcast,

6314
02:51:20,711 --> 02:51:22,050
you should save the label,

6315
02:51:22,051 --> 02:51:23,550
but for some reason it doesn't it.

6316
02:51:23,610 --> 02:51:23,881
Yeah,

6317
02:51:23,881 --> 02:51:24,750
there is a glitch,

6318
02:51:24,780 --> 02:51:26,670
but we still have to label them anywhere.

6319
02:51:26,940 --> 02:51:27,460
Fuck,

6320
02:51:27,460 --> 02:51:28,300
go together Cox.

6321
02:51:28,320 --> 02:51:29,153
So just watching the history.

6322
02:51:29,240 --> 02:51:30,240
Soccer's no,

6323
02:51:30,241 --> 02:51:30,571
Brian,

6324
02:51:30,571 --> 02:51:31,140
you got to,

6325
02:51:31,140 --> 02:51:32,580
this is the youth stream to say,

6326
02:51:32,581 --> 02:51:34,070
just wash to use Vimeo.

6327
02:51:34,970 --> 02:51:35,850
You fucked up pal.

6328
02:51:35,910 --> 02:51:38,810
If there's any reason
to watch a on Ustream,

6329
02:51:38,820 --> 02:51:39,110
there's,

6330
02:51:39,110 --> 02:51:41,460
there's no reason to watch it
on Ustream Maynard's on Bryant.

6331
02:51:41,950 --> 02:51:43,350
If they want to watch on Ustream,

6332
02:51:43,351 --> 02:51:44,700
they should be able to watch on Ustream.

6333
02:51:44,701 --> 02:51:46,200
We just didn't needs on Ustream,

6334
02:51:46,201 --> 02:51:48,090
which just it needs to
be labeled anywhere.

6335
02:51:48,091 --> 02:51:48,481
It is.

6336
02:51:48,481 --> 02:51:49,380
It needs to be labeled.

6337
02:51:49,560 --> 02:51:52,080
You can't just have watch it
and find out who the guest is.

6338
02:51:52,081 --> 02:51:52,531
That's silly.

6339
02:51:52,531 --> 02:51:53,370
We need to label it.

6340
02:51:53,400 --> 02:51:54,233
Okay.

6341
02:51:54,300 --> 02:51:54,600
Okay.

6342
02:51:54,600 --> 02:51:58,740
I think everybody on Twitter would agree
and I think majority of people probably

6343
02:51:58,741 --> 02:52:00,570
watching it on youtube or Vimeo.

6344
02:52:00,600 --> 02:52:00,750
No,

6345
02:52:00,750 --> 02:52:04,410
they're watching it right now on Ustream
and they might go back to it and watch

6346
02:52:04,411 --> 02:52:04,810
it again.

6347
02:52:04,810 --> 02:52:05,800
Thousands of people do.

6348
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:07,120
This is a silly conversation,

6349
02:52:07,121 --> 02:52:07,840
Brian.

6350
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:09,230
I asked you to do it and you didn't do it.

6351
02:52:09,250 --> 02:52:10,860
It's all it is now.

6352
02:52:10,930 --> 02:52:12,160
You told me to start doing it.

6353
02:52:12,430 --> 02:52:13,263
I've been doing,

6354
02:52:13,470 --> 02:52:15,520
I said we have to go back
and relabeled them too,

6355
02:52:15,530 --> 02:52:16,020
and that's,

6356
02:52:16,020 --> 02:52:17,410
that's insane.

6357
02:52:17,411 --> 02:52:18,244
How many,

6358
02:52:18,250 --> 02:52:19,090
how long that will take.

6359
02:52:19,210 --> 02:52:19,841
Oh my God.

6360
02:52:19,841 --> 02:52:20,531
That's a job,

6361
02:52:20,531 --> 02:52:20,860
Brian.

6362
02:52:20,860 --> 02:52:22,240
That's what part of having a job.

6363
02:52:22,241 --> 02:52:23,530
Don't forget to come to the ice house.

6364
02:52:23,531 --> 02:52:23,690
Me,

6365
02:52:23,690 --> 02:52:25,180
you're not even doing
those videos anymore.

6366
02:52:25,230 --> 02:52:25,901
We're not even doing it.

6367
02:52:25,901 --> 02:52:30,901
Told me to stop recording so we have time
to give you more time to give you more

6368
02:52:31,061 --> 02:52:31,840
time for shit,

6369
02:52:31,840 --> 02:52:34,880
for going back and labeling to give
you more time to do other shit.

6370
02:52:34,881 --> 02:52:37,360
They need to do a hired
somebody to do that.

6371
02:52:37,550 --> 02:52:39,520
She'll pay him 20 bucks to do good.

6372
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:40,050
Well,

6373
02:52:40,050 --> 02:52:41,320
she would do on a tremendous show.

6374
02:52:41,320 --> 02:52:43,070
Make sure you go for the no,

6375
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:44,260
this is a silly conversation,

6376
02:52:44,261 --> 02:52:45,094
right?

6377
02:52:45,180 --> 02:52:46,570
A lot of people who have
to do things in their job,

6378
02:52:46,571 --> 02:52:47,680
they don't know.

6379
02:52:47,681 --> 02:52:51,980
What I'm saying is if you
go to Joe rogan.net where
everyone goes to watch in an

6380
02:52:52,010 --> 02:52:52,300
overbearing,

6381
02:52:52,300 --> 02:52:52,960
I know your point,

6382
02:52:52,960 --> 02:52:53,591
I know your point.

6383
02:52:53,591 --> 02:52:57,160
But the bottom line is it's
on the Internet on Ustream.

6384
02:52:57,190 --> 02:53:00,550
There's the channel where people watch
the show live when they want to watch

6385
02:53:00,570 --> 02:53:03,730
your life and none of those
things are labeled right.

6386
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:05,350
But what I'm saying is if you're going,

6387
02:53:05,351 --> 02:53:05,591
hey,

6388
02:53:05,591 --> 02:53:07,900
I want to watch Joe Rogan
and Joey Diaz right now,

6389
02:53:08,110 --> 02:53:08,351
uh,

6390
02:53:08,351 --> 02:53:08,891
I'm gonna go to jail.

6391
02:53:08,891 --> 02:53:09,700
Oregon's website.

6392
02:53:09,700 --> 02:53:09,881
Oh,

6393
02:53:09,881 --> 02:53:10,540
there it is.

6394
02:53:10,540 --> 02:53:10,691
Oh,

6395
02:53:10,691 --> 02:53:11,524
cool.

6396
02:53:12,100 --> 02:53:12,340
Okay.

6397
02:53:12,340 --> 02:53:13,091
No one's going to be like,

6398
02:53:13,091 --> 02:53:13,420
go,

6399
02:53:13,420 --> 02:53:14,190
what's he going to do?

6400
02:53:14,190 --> 02:53:16,160
St TV backslash Joe Rogan.

6401
02:53:16,161 --> 02:53:16,330
Yes,

6402
02:53:16,330 --> 02:53:18,020
they would because that's
where they watch it live.

6403
02:53:18,040 --> 02:53:19,300
You don't think they bookmark that?

6404
02:53:19,330 --> 02:53:20,950
They watch it live all the time.

6405
02:53:21,160 --> 02:53:21,550
I see.

6406
02:53:21,550 --> 02:53:21,960
I know,

6407
02:53:21,960 --> 02:53:22,331
I know.

6408
02:53:22,331 --> 02:53:22,631
I know.

6409
02:53:22,631 --> 02:53:25,120
It sucks and I know I'll
have somebody do it,

6410
02:53:25,420 --> 02:53:30,420
but I'm just saying it's really ridiculous
to watch it on like an inferior,

6411
02:53:30,790 --> 02:53:33,160
like the version on Vimeo.

6412
02:53:33,280 --> 02:53:33,940
Beautiful.

6413
02:53:33,940 --> 02:53:34,930
The version on Youtube.

6414
02:53:35,140 --> 02:53:35,710
Beautiful.

6415
02:53:35,710 --> 02:53:36,510
Both of those are,

6416
02:53:36,510 --> 02:53:36,940
you know,

6417
02:53:36,940 --> 02:53:38,050
easily on your phones,

6418
02:53:38,051 --> 02:53:39,880
on your DVD players or new TVs.

6419
02:53:40,120 --> 02:53:41,520
Like totally understand.

6420
02:53:41,610 --> 02:53:42,490
They still watch it.

6421
02:53:42,650 --> 02:53:44,740
I told her son that however it is there,

6422
02:53:44,741 --> 02:53:45,760
and people do watch it,

6423
02:53:45,761 --> 02:53:46,660
so it needs to be labeled.

6424
02:53:46,690 --> 02:53:48,020
There's one guy somewhere in Iowa,

6425
02:53:48,150 --> 02:53:49,030
so a lot of people do.

6426
02:53:49,031 --> 02:53:52,480
There's thousands of views on all of
these videos that you're watching it right

6427
02:53:52,481 --> 02:53:53,314
now,

6428
02:53:54,100 --> 02:53:55,930
that maybe and a little bit in the future,

6429
02:53:56,080 --> 02:53:57,250
but they need to know
what they're watching.

6430
02:53:57,730 --> 02:53:58,451
It's not that big a deal,

6431
02:53:58,451 --> 02:53:58,990
man.

6432
02:53:58,990 --> 02:54:00,550
You're not working in Malaysia.

6433
02:54:00,930 --> 02:54:01,763
I know.

6434
02:54:01,870 --> 02:54:04,900
Fucking farming Jakks Rachel
does talk to this kid.

6435
02:54:04,930 --> 02:54:05,470
Tell him,

6436
02:54:05,470 --> 02:54:06,240
straighten them out it.

6437
02:54:06,240 --> 02:54:06,910
You know what I'm saying?

6438
02:54:06,910 --> 02:54:08,170
I don't know what's going on.

6439
02:54:08,180 --> 02:54:10,570
All I know is tomorrow night,

6440
02:54:10,571 --> 02:54:11,171
Friday night,

6441
02:54:11,171 --> 02:54:11,891
paramount theater,

6442
02:54:11,891 --> 02:54:12,401
eight o'clock,

6443
02:54:12,401 --> 02:54:13,234
Brendan Walsh,

6444
02:54:13,450 --> 02:54:15,280
Joe Rogan to taking it
off the fucking hoax.

6445
02:54:15,281 --> 02:54:19,600
Joey Diaz ready or rock stolen to the
gills and then with the Mandalay Bay

6446
02:54:19,601 --> 02:54:20,141
events center,

6447
02:54:20,141 --> 02:54:21,760
the whole fucking dead squad crew,

6448
02:54:21,940 --> 02:54:23,050
the flying jewel,

6449
02:54:23,260 --> 02:54:24,250
Duncan Trussell,

6450
02:54:24,400 --> 02:54:25,150
Joey Diaz,

6451
02:54:25,150 --> 02:54:25,983
everybody man.

6452
02:54:26,050 --> 02:54:27,730
The fucking headline of Joe Rogan.

6453
02:54:27,940 --> 02:54:29,890
Where else we go to the Mandalay bay.

6454
02:54:29,891 --> 02:54:30,724
One's going to be big.

6455
02:54:31,020 --> 02:54:32,080
The Mandalay Bay one is,

6456
02:54:32,081 --> 02:54:34,480
we're doing the Wayans
ladies and gentlemen,

6457
02:54:34,481 --> 02:54:36,610
where the wins are for the UFC.

6458
02:54:36,611 --> 02:54:38,890
It seats like think it's like 3000 people.

6459
02:54:39,070 --> 02:54:39,903
That's what we're doing.

6460
02:54:39,910 --> 02:54:40,421
We're doing,

6461
02:54:40,421 --> 02:54:42,100
when they block it off for the wins,

6462
02:54:42,250 --> 02:54:43,990
that's the area we're
going to do comedy yet.

6463
02:54:43,991 --> 02:54:47,610
And there was the idea of Mandalay bay
because we used to do that theater that

6464
02:54:47,620 --> 02:54:48,100
they had.

6465
02:54:48,100 --> 02:54:48,740
Um,

6466
02:54:48,740 --> 02:54:49,080
what was,

6467
02:54:49,080 --> 02:54:52,060
what was the show that things
like the lion king and they,

6468
02:54:52,061 --> 02:54:52,360
uh,

6469
02:54:52,360 --> 02:54:53,193
they changed that.

6470
02:54:53,200 --> 02:54:57,340
They're doing a new Michael Jackson type
thing and they're building it up right

6471
02:54:57,341 --> 02:54:57,551
now.

6472
02:54:57,551 --> 02:54:59,050
So that thing is closed.

6473
02:54:59,051 --> 02:55:00,490
So it was their idea to do that.

6474
02:55:00,491 --> 02:55:01,990
So this is the first time
we're ever doing this.

6475
02:55:02,410 --> 02:55:06,920
We're going to do the Mandalay Bay
theater and that's August 31st and again,

6476
02:55:06,921 --> 02:55:07,910
that's Ari Shaffir,

6477
02:55:07,940 --> 02:55:08,900
Joe Diaz,

6478
02:55:09,440 --> 02:55:10,810
Duncan Trussell inmate.

6479
02:55:11,020 --> 02:55:12,250
So it's going to be fun.

6480
02:55:12,251 --> 02:55:12,740
It's fun.

6481
02:55:12,740 --> 02:55:14,210
Next Wednesday you were in Nashville,

6482
02:55:14,211 --> 02:55:15,044
Chattanooga,

6483
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:16,153
fucking Atlanta.

6484
02:55:16,400 --> 02:55:17,420
Fucking Michigan,

6485
02:55:17,421 --> 02:55:18,111
Mississippi.

6486
02:55:18,111 --> 02:55:18,944
I tell you what,

6487
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:23,480
I'm coming to Nashville xannies Wednesday
eight o'clock six one five two six

6488
02:55:23,481 --> 02:55:26,690
nine oh two to one gets
you a fucking tickets now.

6489
02:55:26,900 --> 02:55:27,880
There's a couple of them left.

6490
02:55:28,280 --> 02:55:29,990
We need to do a paper view.

6491
02:55:30,020 --> 02:55:31,040
Joey Diaz,

6492
02:55:31,130 --> 02:55:31,580
uh,

6493
02:55:31,580 --> 02:55:33,590
storytelling shows those
shows that you're doing.

6494
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:34,640
That's a good idea.

6495
02:55:34,640 --> 02:55:35,473
Put that shit up,

6496
02:55:35,630 --> 02:55:36,260
but then shut up.

6497
02:55:36,260 --> 02:55:36,351
Well,

6498
02:55:36,351 --> 02:55:38,780
you know what it was like
number 29 for the on tools.

6499
02:55:38,840 --> 02:55:40,160
How many of those have you done so far?

6500
02:55:40,340 --> 02:55:41,180
I got five of them.

6501
02:55:41,240 --> 02:55:42,410
The one that we just tape.

6502
02:55:42,440 --> 02:55:43,920
I got a problem with the one before.

6503
02:55:43,921 --> 02:55:44,691
It wasn't that good.

6504
02:55:44,691 --> 02:55:48,230
So we scrapped it and their audios and
the audios yet I'm putting them up on

6505
02:55:48,231 --> 02:55:48,621
