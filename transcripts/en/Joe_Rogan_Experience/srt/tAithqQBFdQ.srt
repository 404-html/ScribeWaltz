1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,900
Three,
two,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,610
one was a.
was this beverage concocted by you?

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,140
First one?
Yes.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,880
You.
You created right brain.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,140
If you asked me.
Yes.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,610
If he has Dudley,
what does he say?

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,060
He was saying maybe he was there.
Maybe he was there,

8
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:23,010
but it might have been there.
He was definitely there.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,590
Yeah.
But whose idea?

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,610
It's hard to say with these things.
Show cheers.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,870
Good to see you.
You look good.

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,270
You look good to get better with this 
shirt,

13
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,100
right?
That shirt.

14
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,330
The new Benno Brian Special.
Get that shirt.

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,880
Can you get this from your website?
We'll go to the mediator.

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,820
The mediator.com.
You go to the store and it's there.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah.
So what people uh,

18
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:43,680
you know I had steven,
Steven Rinella,

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,753
our good friend and we were talking 
about what they're doing with what 

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,290
mediators doing.
This is very strange thing where there's

21
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,643
this giant multimedia corporation has 
stepped in and throwing a ton of money 

22
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,523
at mediator and all these different 
companies that are involved in the 

23
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:02,310
outdoors.

24
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,143
All these outdoor activities.
That is true and they're putting it all 

25
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:09,840
together into one super network 
Juggernaut,

26
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,180
a juggernaut of outdoor activities.
True.

27
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,260
It's true.
Yeah.

28
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:15,030
Uh,
it is,

29
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:15,841
um,
something.

30
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:18,930
I've never been a part of it before.
Something like I've never seen before in

31
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:21,210
the hunting industry.
Has it ever existed before?

32
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,710
I don't think so.
No,

33
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,970
I don't think so.
Can't be.

34
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,460
Can't be.
So we would have known about what better

35
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,810
to try than something that's never been 
done.

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,913
Well,
you had been doing your podcast for 

37
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,900
what?
Like a year now.

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,400
How long have you been doing?
About 10 months now.

39
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:33,370
Ten months.
Ten months.

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,433
And uh,
and we were just saying that I tried to 

41
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:39,390
get you to do one five years ago.
Five years ago.

42
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,840
Yeah.
Ben and I met on a moose hunt in British

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,360
Columbia and I would say that it was 
like friendship at first.

44
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,850
We had a great fucking time,
a great fucking time.

45
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,940
Shout out to Mike Cochran and Sam.
So halt with this as well.

46
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,813
Like I would always describe that as 
like the most fun I've ever had on a 

47
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:59,490
hunt.
It was a good baby ever.

48
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,960
I don't know,
we've done a lot of stuff.

49
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,823
We were laughing a lot.
That's why it was like a lot of fun and 

50
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:07,260
a lot of it wasn't a hardship.
Like we didn't sleep in tents.

51
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,450
Note we slept at Mike's House,
which is great.

52
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,550
And then it was a lot of hiking and 
stuff and you know,

53
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,393
it wasn't successful until like the very
last days and you shot a moose in the 

54
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,150
celebration was fantastic.
We had a good time.

55
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,730
We had a great sense.
Super hammered the last night.

56
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:25,140
Remember last night,
what were you drinking?

57
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,570
Like some kind of spiced rum or some 
kind?

58
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,850
I don't know.
It got it got real.

59
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,853
It's well when you're drunk and you're 
drunk in the middle of nowhere and 

60
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:35,000
there's wolves everywhere.
It's a different kind of draw.

61
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:35,843
Remember we remember,
remember that we went and we shot your 

62
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:40,700
bull,
right?

63
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,533
And,
but then we took the heart and the 

64
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:42,564
liver.
Yep.

65
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,453
We started drinking heavily and you were
up there to cook and liver and onions 

66
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,423
cooking up a giant moose heart.
So we had like the fuel of organs of an 

67
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:54,360
animal you just killed,
like it's Kinda like trash bag,

68
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:56,160
Canadian rum.
That was terrible.

69
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,260
Yeah.
And that's where the party did,

70
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,920
but it worked.
It worked a real good.

71
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,050
I

72
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,840
don't know what's good rum or bad room 
at all.

73
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,810
To me,
I kind of get good whiskey now.

74
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,810
I understand whiskey sort of,
but be an Irish.

75
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:11,050
It's just like it's all just goes in,
gets in there and then it just does what

76
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:12,300
it does when it's in there.
Yeah.

77
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,000
Once the part is begun.
Like here's what I don't get Tequila.

78
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,470
Good Tequila.
Every Tequila average,

79
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,313
right?
I go like this.

80
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,210
What about that George Clooney,
Tequila,

81
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,440
Tequila,
Tequila Jamie,

82
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:26,080
Jamie.
You'll know.

83
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,570
Well listen,
I'll tell you what sounds like a,

84
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,453
like a fancy George Clooney.
Tequila can suck a dick because ron 

85
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:37,801
white's got his own Tequila.
Numero won sarcastic Tequila.

86
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,030
It's just,
that's what he calls it.

87
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:41,920
Numeral one tomorrow.
One Tequila.

88
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,090
I think that's what it's called,
right?

89
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,010
Number one,
or is it number one?

90
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,190
Number one.
Number one,

91
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,383
George Clooney wasn't good enough at 
everything else and all handsome and 

92
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:52,120
wonderful.

93
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,490
He made a Tequila company and like did 
it right.

94
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:56,160
If you listen to the the origin story of
it,

95
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,550
they did it right.
Well,

96
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,550
I'm looking at the company.
There's another one,

97
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,360
Ron White.
No,

98
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,520
that I wanted shit to.
Ron's is good shit,

99
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,680
but I think George Clooney has got 
enough money so fuck him,

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,290
but I think he sold it for millions and 
billions of dollars.

101
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,143
Yeah.
See what happened is he got married and 

102
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:12,160
he realized it wasn't.
I'm going to have some money on the side

103
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,210
in case the shit hits the rocks.
What do I like to do?

104
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:18,740
And I'm a little bit bored and not 
feeling it.

105
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,770
Tequila.
Yeah.

106
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,980
Every man who has ever heard an awful 
divorce story,

107
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,110
no matter how good it's going,
every awful divorce started with I do.

108
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,970
They all started with idea.
They all started with good intentions.

109
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:33,804
You,
you're amazing and good intentions 

110
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,640
started with good times,
man.

111
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,533
How we'll say it again,
I won't say the name of the person 

112
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:41,490
because it would just be me and not 
knock it.

113
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,513
There was a fellow that I like.
I knew in my younger years that got 

114
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:50,420
married and I was in the wedding party,
so she got there.

115
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,770
She got there.
Let's weed.

116
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,530
It's very dangerous.
Dangerous for you.

117
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,500
If you're living in Montana,
you can't handle this yet.

118
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,861
No,
no,

119
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:57,760
no.
It's not legal there.

120
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,220
They made it illegal medical.
They made medical legal.

121
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,490
Then they voted it out.
Fucking savages go with a male.

122
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,013
They made medical legal and they had 
dispensaries and then they voted the 

123
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:09,694
dispensary's out.
When I was in Bozeman last time I was 

124
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:11,941
there,
they were.

125
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:14,500
They were shutting down the doors of the
dispensary's.

126
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,480
You're living in the golden land here.
Yeah,

127
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,410
but you know what?
I hesitate to say this,

128
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,760
but it's probably for the best.

129
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,370
Just to keep people like me were in a 
safe space.

130
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,170
It's just me and you were in the trust 
tree.

131
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,900
Ring the nest.
Bozeman is so special.

132
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,380
It's such a cool little town we 
shouldn't be talking about.

133
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,220
I shouldn't be telling people how great 
it is,

134
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,290
so terrible place.
Bears will eat you alive.

135
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,330
They really in the streets there in the 
streets,

136
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,450
but the good thing is the dumb people 
get eaten by bears.

137
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,523
That's true.
Like people turn up missing like some 

138
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:45,220
assholes deals.
Lawn mowers.

139
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,323
He'll just turn up missing visit.
He'll be out there and we've gone bear 

140
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,133
just forest.
Yeah.

141
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,353
Yeah.
They get cocky and you know people that 

142
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:58,130
just make it to live to be 100 and la 
they get eaten

143
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,130
when only 35.
That's we'll place.

144
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,080
Yeah,
but that's in the summer.

145
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,420
Don't give a fuck.
I was there in the winter.

146
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:10,460
It's like it's like that.
But White.

147
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,420
Yeah.
You ever seen the show?

148
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:12,254
Game of thrones in the winter.
It's like white walkers when there's a 

149
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,530
large ice wall.
When did you move?

150
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,270
We just.
My family just moved there.

151
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:24,080
We just moved into our brand new home 
about three weeks ago there.

152
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,630
Mr Rogen,
but you were there before.

153
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:28,130
Were you renting?
I was renting.

154
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,993
Living Out of A.
I lived out of a storage unit for a 

155
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:31,700
time.
I had heard about this rumor,

156
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,270
there was a rumor,
wild Bento,

157
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,143
Brian Brian lives in storage in the 
storage unit and said it was a nice 

158
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,523
storage unit.
Shout out to the airport in north 

159
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,420
storage.
You just sleeping there.

160
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,293
Oh,
well did you get a gym membership or 

161
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:47,810
something?
Listen,

162
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,650
airport,
north storage.

163
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,600
It's time for me to tell the truth.
Oh my God,

164
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:51,740
I can't believe you're coming clean with
them.

165
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,760
I'm coming and clean.
I did sleep in there some nights I slept

166
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,150
in a storage unit because there are laws
against that.

167
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,463
I probably.
It's probably like in the contract when 

168
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,620
you sign not to do that.
Really?

169
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:05,180
I did it anyway.
What do you think will happen to you?

170
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,050
They would probably be out of the 
storage unit and get a hotel.

171
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:14,030
You fucking Weirdo you fucking loser,
but I just did that,

172
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:15,440
you know,
as a sacrifice for my family.

173
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:18,290
We're building the house I needed to be 
where my job was.

174
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,110
Plus you camp out there.
We can't put this beautiful man.

175
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,123
It's beautiful.
And in Bozeman is so popular that time 

176
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,790
of year that it's hard to.
Oh,

177
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,624
that's right.
Yeah,

178
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,260
it's hard to find a place to stay for a 
short period of time,

179
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,800
begin b's and all that stuff.

180
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,360
That ain't really going down.
Amazing.

181
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:34,550
Airbnb,
they just figured out a way to like rent

182
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:36,430
houses on make money when no one's 
there.

183
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,150
Like Hey,
I'm good.

184
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,950
How did nobody ever figured that out 
before?

185
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,843
It's Kinda crazy.
So there's a lot of these technology 

186
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:45,950
companies like learn.
We do in that before uber is a great one

187
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,843
too.
I was coming home the other night and 

188
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,640
there was five lifts behind me so you 
know,

189
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:55,070
lyft is different because they have that
weird thing on the dash,

190
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:59,010
that little light it and it was like I 
was being chased by these purple robots.

191
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,320
I was like,
what the fuck is this?

192
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:01,154
This is strange.
I was going to ask if you had the 

193
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:04,070
storage,
the big storage unit story Fernandez.

194
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,690
You guys were just talking about that.
No,

195
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,150
this big storage unit story.
Yeah.

196
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,410
You remember like just to show that was 
on the storage wars,

197
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:09,780
whatever.

198
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,320
Oh yeah.
The guy that was responsible for selling

199
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:13,154
them to people sold one to a guy for 
$500 and inside was a safe that had 

200
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,110
seven point $5,000,000
in cash in it.

201
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,240
Look at that guy.
Was this one that,

202
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,840
you know,
it wasn't on the show.

203
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,900
It just happened recently,
so the guy that bought it,

204
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,700
but I actually was contacted by lawyers 
from the people who owned it and he made

205
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:33,680
a deal with them.
What's the deal?

206
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,660
What's the deal?
Like a million or something like that.

207
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,500
I gave the the Joe do you want to go 
into a business where storage wars?

208
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,880
Yeah,
guy's face.

209
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,930
We get the fuck.
I say this lady is happy dumb.

210
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:48,344
You have to feel.
You have a whole show about people 

211
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,654
finding things in storage units.
You sell a storage unit and it's got 

212
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:55,500
$7,000,000
in seven and a half,

213
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,880
seven and a half million dollars.

214
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,770
Still though the dude gets to keep a 
million.

215
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,780
How does that work though,
is in his storage unit.

216
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,640
How would he chose that kind of fuck 
off?

217
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,400
Where do you go?
Someone lost $7,000,000.

218
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,530
Well,
for gonna come after you.

219
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:09,120
How dirty is that money.
Exactly.

220
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,620
Somebody must be safe and it wasn't just
the safe only in the storage unit.

221
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,454
Oh,
that's got to be something bad and get 

222
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,194
that handsome dude.
That was in the beginning of ozarks at 

223
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:21,360
handsome Mexican dude.
Straight up murder.

224
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,570
He's going to come visit you.
Hello man.

225
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,250
Yeah,
that guy was my favorite.

226
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,250
I was so sad when they spoiler alert.
So sad when they killed him.

227
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,520
Like the dude from breaking bad.
That comes around he twins.

228
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,260
But did you see Ozark?
You ever see Ozark?

229
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,990
I watched like the first couple episodes
and I fucked it up for you.

230
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,873
Yeah,
because it was a pivotal moment and I 

231
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,200
just gave voice to many.

232
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,360
There's so many shows though.
There are so many shows,

233
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:44,350
but that's a damn good one.
Is it good?

234
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,650
That is a damn good show.
What's the guy?

235
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,290
The Guy who stars in it.
Jason Bateman Bateman.

236
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,250
He's excellent in the woman.
Laura Linney Linney.

237
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,560
She's amazing.
The family's amazing kids.

238
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,090
Amazing.
It's fucking show,

239
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,230
man.
It's a show.

240
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,433
It's dope.
You get sucked in and that Netflix lets 

241
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:03,090
you watch them all like,
are you ready?

242
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,470
Listen,
let me ask you a question.

243
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,843
I asked.
A lot of people is not set to set up a 

244
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,393
Christmas party and I got with a bunch 
of hunters and I got a couple of like 

245
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,993
the stinkeye like,
what's this guy talking to 

246
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:14,280
conservatives?
I don't know,

247
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,114
but if that maybe I'm just weird.
Have you ever seen the movie the 

248
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:19,980
greatest showman?
Oh,

249
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:21,060
is that the,
um,

250
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,240
the musical?
It is.

251
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,950
I've been forced to watch segments of 
that with my wife and children.

252
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,590
It is fantastic.
Very good movie.

253
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,400
Hugh Jackman's in angel.
He's an angel and Australian Angel.

254
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,470
He is.
He sent down here to save us.

255
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:36,690
Save us.
You ever seen him dance and sing?

256
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,610
He's magical.
I'm a hunter.

257
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:40,710
I got a hunting podcast.
But I'm telling you,

258
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,970
you're a manly man.
Look at that beard.

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,833
Yeah,
we get this thing,

260
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,110
but I love that movie.
It's a great movie.

261
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,690
I listened to it on the Pandora,
the greatest showman channel,

262
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,583
and I sing the tune.
Listen to my favorite comedy on TV is 

263
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,760
the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.
I'm okay.

264
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:56,310
So I can't be talking about man liftings
or non mainly.

265
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,210
Thanks.
Hugh Jackman,

266

Look at him,

268
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,830
look at him.
Wow Man.

269
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,020
Show gorgeous man.
He's just.

270
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,510
I mean it's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

271
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,523
But yeah,
I get,

272
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,930
I get,
I get made fun of for this.

273
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,700
My.
Of course my son likes it.

274
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:15,960
My wife likes it,
but I enjoy.

275
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,360
I get into like your son.
How old is he?

276
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,580
He's two.
He doesn't know anybody,

277
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,030
but he just liked the music.
He just happening.

278
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,910
Something's going on.
Yeah,

279
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,550
that there's some on the TV.
He's not like a crazy.

280
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,413
He's not writing that critique APP,
but if you put it on Dora the explorer 

281
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:28,650
and then you switched it over to that 
bullshit.

282
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,450
He believes this fucking guy dancing.
No,

283
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,930
he'll be Dora.
Dora.

284
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,023
Yeah.
Listen,

285
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,953
I think that I watched like if you watch
things like game of thrones where 

286
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:40,320
they're burning children.
Yeah.

287
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,720
And like it's entertaining,
but sometimes I need a break.

288
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,260
I'd like to watch a man dance around and
sing for a woman,

289
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:46,920
whatever.
It don't matter.

290
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,610
Those those shows can get dark where you
like,

291
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,510
what am I doing to myself,
you know,

292
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,010
like narcos.
Oh yeah.

293
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,980
And they would just go into a

294
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,813
fucking nightclub and gun people down.
Just sitting there watching like women 

295
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:58,024
and children get smoked in it.
It's what's the other show with Anthony 

296
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,160
Hopkins on HBO.
What's that?

297
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:04,920
The robots.
Oh,

298
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,763
westworld.
The same way they're shooting kids on 

299
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:09,520
there though.
The kids a robot.

300
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,540
We can just pass that one right in the 
face.

301
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,393
Dark.
So every once in a while you need to 

302
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:15,280
sprinkle a little bit of musical in your
life,

303
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,930
I believe.
Yeah.

304
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:17,843
What is that do you think?
And here's come coming from a person 

305
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:22,900
that's been on a bunch of life changing 
experiences and I know you have,

306
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,550
I want to talk to you about some of 
them.

307
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,443
Yes.
Especially the one in Nepal where you 

308
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:28,270
almost died and you saw children in 
wolves,

309
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,193
babies.
We talked about that on the last 

310
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:31,780
podcast,
but it's probably,

311
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,210
it would be worth revisiting.
Um,

312
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,580
what do you think this is like why?

313
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,350
Why are we so obsessed with life or 
death drama that's artificial?

314
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,360
Well,
you see it like in the,

315
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:44,980
in the,
in the show Westworld,

316
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:49,630
they talk about like it being a game 
that being this game of excess,

317
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:50,464
like what can I do in my real life?
So when you watch TV and you watch 

318
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:57,520
murdering and you watched this,
this evil thing come to life,

319
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,350
you're just,
you're,

320
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,243
it's,
it really is something that you can be 

321
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,220
transported,
can't do that in your regular life.

322
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,250
Fruits for sure.
With Westworld,

323
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,880
what you're getting is basically a real 
live version that red dead redemption.

324
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,720
Yes.
Right.

325
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,460
So when you,
when you play that,

326
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,090
we were talking about the other day,
how this guy got in trouble because they

327
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:18,730
have all these things in the game that 
you can do to people.

328
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,683
And this guy like ty this hook her up,
threw her off a cliff and shit and you 

329
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,890
can start,
you can do whatever you want.

330
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,530
But they were filming this stuff and 
putting it on youtube.

331
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,650
And then youtube would get mad and 
youtube pulled them off.

332
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,240
But then people are like,
well,

333
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:32,890
wait a minute though,
why?

334
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,030
How come you can just do it?
Like why did you have that in the game?

335
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,480
But when my dad was my age 30,
40 years ago,

336
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:43,654
there would,
they would never have ever does nothing 

337
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,480
done anything like game of thrones or 
Westworld?

338
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,310
Never ever.
In fact,

339
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:53,500
there was a westworld and it wasn't 
anywhere near like it is.

340
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,960
You'll be modern day.
Good moving.

341
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,770
Yeah.
But I think we've just stretched out the

342
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,630
limits to which we're willing to 
explore,

343
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:04,090
like really terrible and evil things for
entertainment.

344
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,403
We've definitely changed what we're 
willing to accept and where the bar is 

345
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:12,340
in terms of quality,
the bars through the roof,

346
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:13,174
through the roof.
It's immersive to the point where you 

347
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:18,100
can't even can't even explain what 
you're experiencing when you're watching

348
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:18,520
these shows.

349
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,280
Yeah.
So like if you go and you see some great

350
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:22,114
comedy from the 19 nineties,
like you see watch a Dave Chappelle and 

351
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,163
Chris rock specials in the nineties that
holds up 100 percent and Seinfeld it 

352
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:32,963
gives up.
But what I'm saying is like if that was 

353
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:35,674
out today,
it would be a 100 percent standup 

354
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,910
special prayer.
Be Like,

355
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:40,803
Oh,
you see the new Chris Rock's bigger and 

356
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:42,760
blacker.
It's fucking amazing.

357
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,450
But if you tried to put some bullshit 
ass 19 nineties TV show on,

358
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,373
on Netflix,
if you to like finagle some CSI Miami 

359
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:58,210
type shit.
You know what I mean?

360
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,290
Something.
Some nonsense.

361
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,390
I don't know if CSI Miami,
is that even a show?

362
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,790
Is that a real sharp?
There's a CSI Miami.

363
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,020
There is.
There's several.

364
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,290
There's many CSI I guessed,
but we'd like to order law and order.

365
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,124
There's so many of those.
But we've expanded our willingness to 

366
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,910
like explore things that are.
I mean,

367
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,990
game of thrones for example,
is one of the best shows ever created in

368
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:23,991
my opinion for sure.
But it explores some unthinkable thing.

369
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,140
Awful things.
Awful things.

370
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,550
Well,
it's the whole show.

371
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,523
Spoiler alert is around a brother and 
sister were fucked and had a whole 

372
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:32,464
family.
Yeah.

373
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,250
Yeah.

374
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,090
So it explore these,
these things that in we would never even

375
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:39,610
touch upon in our media in the fifties,
sixties,

376
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,950
the seventies.
We be touched upon those things in a way

377
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:42,570
that we do now.

378
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,860
No,
not only that,

379
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,250
but here's the thing.
Law and order's not a bad show.

380
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,060
Like if you watch it,
you'll be entertained.

381
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,860
So what happened?
Why?

382
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:55,170
Why do we go not good enough?
Like what?

383
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,033
What was it was it was the question,
did they go not good enough or is it 

384
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:05,910
like like porn?
Like if you watch porn,

385
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,013
okay.
And you watch some porn from the 19 

386
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:10,760
eighties and then you flipped through 
like youporn.

387
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,470
Not that I would ever do that,
but if you did do that and looked at all

388
00:16:13,471 --> 00:16:14,730
the different categories,
you'd be like,

389
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:16,110
what the fuck happened?
Yeah.

390
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,153
Like why are people.
Why has gagging something people are 

391
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:22,860
looking for?
It's not an accident

392
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,063
category.
We've expanded our ability to conceive 

393
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:26,920
of things.
Yes.

394
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,060
In immediate space where we can create,
you can create dragons that,

395
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,930
that breathe ice.
You can create.

396
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,240
There's,
there's things you can be transported,

397
00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:35,020
like,
listen,

398
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,900
this isn't real so I can.
I can do this,

399
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:38,883
right?
I can have this scene of of rape or 

400
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,334
infidelity or are incest that seems 
appropriate to me only in this fantasy 

401
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:49,090
world,
man.

402
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,000
Sometimes I get down on that stuff.
I watch enough of it.

403
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:53,860
You're just like,
I need a musical.

404
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,630
I need to be inspired.
That life is grand and that's how I feel

405
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:02,500
about them and sometimes it comes across
and like this dude washes musicals,

406
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:04,590
but I.
I do for a little bit of a

407
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,790
right.
Something's wrong with it.

408
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,163
What I'm weirded out about is this 
natural human inclination towards 

409
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:15,120
progression in everything good or bad is
that things just keep ramping up

410
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,423
well,
but we're progressing with our 

411
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:20,420
storylines for like humanity in a weird 
way in media,

412
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:22,520
but we're also like suppressing a lot of
our.

413
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,210
We're trying to suppress through social 
justice a lot of the same thing,

414
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:26,701
right?
Well,

415
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:28,950
some people are,
but I think it's a small,

416
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,270
very vocal minority.
I think in reality there's,

417
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,143
the vast majority of people find out 
about said suppression are upset by it 

418
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,583
and they're like,
what in the fuck are you talking about 

419
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,660
this safe spaces and all this nonsense?
Most people that hear that stuff,

420
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,111
we're going,
oh,

421
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:46,290
this is just nonsense by a few,
like really loud,

422
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,120
devastated even on my podcast.
It's something as

423
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,580
serious as hunting is because you're 
killing stuff like that's going out into

424
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:55,590
the world and taking plucking something 
that you didn't put.

425
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,600
They're taking it away,
but I think the core of what I think you

426
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:04,260
do well and what I think others should 
try to do is ask why?

427
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,723
Why are we willing to.
Why is game of thrones the most watched 

428
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:12,240
show that's on right?
Why?

429
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,200
Why,
why?

430
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,540
I can't answer that question,
but it's a conversation because it's.

431
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,200
If it's so fictitious,
right?

432
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,650
It's so obviously fiction.
You're living in this fictional world.

433
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:27,930
You have fictional white walkers,
you have dragons,

434
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,260
he have people that can survive in fire,
parallels to real life and then these,

435
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,093
these ridiculous fantasies,
but then these parallels to real life 

436
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,110
that that travel along the same path and
like you don't get to choose between the

437
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:46,200
dragons and the incest both there at the
same time.

438
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,480
I think it fulfills a lot of like base 
needs,

439
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,470
but it does.
So in this way,

440
00:18:53,471 --> 00:18:55,070
that's obviously false.
Yeah.

441
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,950
So like why are superheroes so huge to 
us?

442
00:18:58,951 --> 00:18:59,784
If you stop and think about the number 
of blockbusters that are superhero 

443
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,353
movies that are comic book movies are 
coming out like once every couple of 

444
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:06,894
months now.
Crazy that that was a rare beast when I 

445
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:11,244
was at.
Yes,

446
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,900
when I was a kid,
there's a hulk movie.

447
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,770
I would've jumped for joy.
It was no Goddamn Spiderman movie when I

448
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:19,650
was a kid.
There was a TV show and it sucked.

449
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,040
Okay.
It was a God damn cartoon TV show,

450
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,020
Spiderman,
Spiderman does whatever.

451
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,290
Spider spins a web size,
catches thieves just like flies couch.

452
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,400
There comes a spider man.
It was terrible.

453
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,090
And I used to get up early to watch it 
because I was a huge comic book.

454
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,010
You've watched the Lou Ferrigno Hulk,
right?

455
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,090
Fuck yeah,
I watched it.

456
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,983
That was a little bit.
I mean like you watch the Batman Adam 

457
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,500
West.
Yeah.

458
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,390
You watch him now and you're like,
what is happening?

459
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:52,210
So they came out with Superman.
He was like the first movies that.

460
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,480
What is the Spiderman TV show?
Wow.

461
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,403
That's another TV show guy in the back 
of the second in the background doing 

462
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,210
who's that guy?
You don't look.

463
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,240
You don't do anything good.
It's got a wooden stick.

464
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,713
He needs to know those shits.
Spiderman can shoot webs out of his 

465
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:06,390
hands and that wouldn't sticks.
Probably not going to do much.

466
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,610
Then then spiderman sort of changes 
ability,

467
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:09,444
right?
Because it used to be able to do like 

468
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,883
now he could just basically fly.
I mean just hurls himself through the 

469
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:15,390
air and sticks to buildings,
you know?

470
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:17,340
He used to be a little harder to swing 
around back because like,

471
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,470
let me drop my backpack full of 
textbooks,

472
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,550
get to it.

473
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,200
But he's.
That was,

474
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:23,034
there was no spiderman movies when I was
kid and there was a superman movie and 

475
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:29,310
the superman movie beget the Batman 
Movie Batman movie came out.

476
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,610
Michael Keaton was a big,
big success.

477
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:35,040
People are shocked at Michael Keaton was
Batman,

478
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,073
but it worked.
Was that like Danny Devito was the 

479
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:38,214
penguin?
Yeah.

480
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,470
Everybody got a shot at Batman was one 
of those things.

481
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,050
If you were Batman,
you must be the it guy towards clooney.

482
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,540
George Clooney was Batman,
Christian Bale's,

483
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,920
Batman Arnold Schwarzenegger was Mr.
Freeze.

484
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,700
But they got to Ben Affleck and no 
player.

485
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,710
Whoa.
Isn't that funny?

486
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,544
Like that's real.
Like the amount of people that will see 

487
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:57,634
you as Batman.
It's whether or not they really believe 

488
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:02,290
it.
They like Christian Bale.

489
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,124
I believe that God could be Batman,
but Michael Keaton for a longest time 

490
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,420
was Batman.
Yes,

491
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:09,610
but see,
he started it off.

492
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,533
See that the difference between Michael 
Keaton is there was no one before him 

493
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:18,040
other than Bruce Wayne,
and he was the first dark real Batman.

494
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,970
I forgot about val kilmer.
I forgot about val kilmer.

495
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,880
Goddammit.
Val kilmer was fucking Batman.

496
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,730
Talented human being.
Val kilmer.

497
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,620
He's a beast at him as a doc holiday.
Oh,

498
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,270
what's this?
What's the name of that movie?

499
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,410
Tombstone?
Tombstone.

500
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,060
God Damn.
That's one of the best.

501
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,250
That's one of the best.
He was spooked students ever.

502
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,750
He was believable.
That was a.

503
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,180
That was a straight up murder.
I still the most quoted,

504
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,283
but see,
nobody will think back on Ben Affleck's 

505
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:46,750
career and be like,
he was Batman.

506
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,400
It's not just that he's done some good 
move.

507
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,010
Yeah,
but he's also.

508
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,710
He always says there's nothing around 
his career that he.

509
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,210
He must feel like,
oh man,

510
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,770
if this goes bad,
it's going to ruin me.

511
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:59,290
He's done so many great things.
He's a very good actor.

512
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:04,350
Don't get me wrong,
but what is it about him?

513
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,850
Is he too handsome?

514
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,570
No,
because val kilmer is gorgeous.

515
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
All those folks were very handsome.
Gigli him and Jennifer Lopez is that.

516
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,290
It was a tough time.
She just say Gigli Gigli.

517
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,900
I think it was really whatever the fuck 
it is.

518
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,810
Whatever the fuck it is.
They look.

519
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,320
Not everybody should get that kind of 
pussy.

520
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,130
It's just.
It shouldn't be on your diet.

521
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,650
It's too rich for you.
Some people get diabetes,

522
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:30,820
right?
They need to lay off the sugar.

523
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,700
Everybody's got different tolerance cake
every morning.

524
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,590
Jennifer Lopez,
obviously,

525
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,820
besides being beautiful and a body like 
some sort of a test tube person,

526
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,073
some lab created super freak.
Obviously she knows how to throw that 

527
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:48,160
thing.
She knows how to throw that thing.

528
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,210
I mean,
it'd be hard to.

529
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:50,530
It would be hard to argue with that 
fact.

530
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:52,150
Yeah,
that's some Goddamn Nolan.

531
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:54,140
Ryan Pussy Shit.

532
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,003
Together.
I am not unaware of what you're talking 

533
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:00,424
about.
I love the fact that those things go so 

534
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:05,260
hard to go so hard and then they fizzle 
out.

535
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,700
They just.
You know what it's like.

536
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:11,560
It's like having a like a pinto with a 
fucking corvette,

537
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:12,394
Zr one engine stuff.
Don't stomp on the gas on the highway 

538
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,810
and there's no structure to it,
but listen to design.

539
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:22,270
Those wheels are not designed for that 
relationship.

540
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,310
Is that why you live in Hollywood?
You're telling me.

541
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:25,144
Is that why these Hollywood 
relationships always like become huge 

542
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:29,980
and then go away?
Sometimes they do.

543
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,370
Sometimes they work.
I live in Montana.

544
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,723
Here's my thing.
This Alex Rodriguez guy that she's with 

545
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:40,060
super athlete smashes it.
Obviously it seems to be working.

546
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,090
They've been together for a long time.
How long have they been together though?

547
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:48,270
Months from six weeks.
When she was with that little bit of the

548
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:50,644
singer.

549
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,640
She got mad.
He was at the UFC that one time,

550
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:53,361
remember?
Oh,

551
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:56,000
that's right.
She left.

552
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,400
Which one was that?
That was the dancer.

553
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,950
That was the dancer.
Can I take.

554
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,290
Can we take a a quick.
This is a like a kind of a PSA,

555
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,124
public service announcement.
Can we take a hard left of Jennifer 

556
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,270
Lopez and get ourselves over to Kanye 
West real quick?

557
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:08,841
Yeah,
we can,

558
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:10,280
but look at that.
Alex Rodrigues.

559
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,510
Okay.
Take a look at that man.

560
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,430
Super Athlete.
Probably got a dick.

561
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:15,620
Like a Goddamn Baseball Bat,
right?

562
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,663
Anybody that has that many buttons.
Let's look at those top buttons coming 

563
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:20,700
down sides of his fist,
the size of that guys.

564
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,790
Paul,
he said two plus $200.

565
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,470
Million contract.
So he's.

566
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,500
He's just gotten $400,000,000
on our giant hot super athlete.

567
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,520
Of course it's going to work.
It's going to smash it together.

568
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:35,354
Let's talk about hunting.
He knows that guy knows how to keep it 

569
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:37,460
together.

570
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,530
Right?
That guy knows he knows how to play when

571
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,020
the ball's coming his way,
he smashes that fucking thing.

572
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,650
I think Jennifer Lopez is not tolerating
any losers in her life at this point.

573
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,390
Left.
She's had a few,

574
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,130
but that's all I look at.
That guy.

575
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,030
Yeah,
there you go.

576
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,110
Super Athlete.
Big giant Hanson.

577
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,900
I'm a big sports fan.
I came up when he was just.

578
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,370
He was.
It was a god,

579
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:57,290
a baseball guy.
They seem to get along together.

580
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,700
Seed.
That makes sense to me.

581
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,300
Just like it made sense with val.
Kilmer was Batman tends to me,

582
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,253
but when Ben Affleck was Ben Affleck,
I don't know how his relationship was 

583
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:06,860
with her.
I don't know.

584
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,020
Maybe it was great.
It seemed like it was a tumultuous,

585
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:10,670
but I'm not.
I'm just observing.

586
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,080
What do I know?
Nobody knows,

587
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,330
but there's some people where you.
You need to have an online vote for this

588
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:21,140
person that definitely the people will 
tell you they would not have voted.

589
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,150
I do not believe they would have voted 
for Ben Affleck.

590
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,940
I do nonbeliever.
Here's the problem,

591
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,460
like the rock too big for Batman.
Here's why.

592
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,960
Because everybody will be like,
oh,

593
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,860
it's you.
The Rock.

594
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,730
You're wearing a fucking bat suit is 
that they wish they could do that.

595
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,980
They can make it funny and be like,
yeah,

596
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,930
are you in the movie?
They can make it funny,

597
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,450
but yeah.
Is this the rock or the rock?

598
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,470
He could never be superman.
Takes his fucking glasses off.

599
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:45,870
You're like,
you're still a giant dude.

600
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,550
The last time doesn't work for the 
regular size,

601
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,563
but that's how it works.
The last guy that was the superman was 

602
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:54,140
an.
It was an unknown.

603
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:56,600
Henry a superman.
They ran out.

604
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,590
They ran out of the.
Well,

605
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,483
the well's dry.
It's like if they try to make another 

606
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:01,190
hawk,
people know enough.

607
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,420
You've had eight hawks.

608
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,460
They're going to keep making them 
through.

609
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,303
They're going to make 100 more star wars
in the next five years and you're going 

610
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:09,170
to have to sit through like Han Solo.
The pre,

611
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,240
pre preschool.
The Cow.

612
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:12,074
Can they do that?
That doesn't make any sense because 

613
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,760
Harrison Ford was Han Solo when Han Solo
was young.

614
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,020
Oh yeah.
We can't just do that.

615
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:18,854
They just came out with the Han Solo 
movie to reel back on that because that 

616
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:22,710
last one didn't do so hot.
Yeah.

617
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,720
They need to ask me to ask Joe.
I'm here for you.

618
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,560
George Lucas.
George Lucas.

619
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,260
Oh,
now bathing and money.

620
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,320
He's flying back in a warm wet money.
He just forgot to listen to the podcast.

621
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,440
He just,
he just gets touched all day.

622
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,650
What was going to be coming out or start
like Adam

623
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,150
to see?
Oh,

624
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,620
they're making them.
They ran out of superheroes.

625
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,470
Superman in the background.
That's superman in the background.

626
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:51,180
See,
it's in the DC universe.

627
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,650
There is in back.
They ran up.

628
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,540
He looks good.
Yeah,

629
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,240
but as long as they don't try to make 
him superman.

630
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,560
Is he a bad guy?
Jamie?

631
00:26:58,561 --> 00:26:59,940
Is he a bad guy or a good guy?
Honestly,

632
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:01,270
I've never heard of this character.
I,

633
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:02,104
I've no idea where he fits in the.
I remember when Netflix came out with 

634
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:06,000
Luke cage,
I was like,

635
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,290
wow,
that's an obscure one.

636
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,153
That was a good one though,
but the Black Panther was good at the 

637
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,561
Black Panthers.
Good.

638
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:11,700
It's a great movie.
Yeah,

639
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:12,534
it's amazing.
It took so long and we go black panther 

640
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:18,330
movie racist took so long and it was a 
giant smash hit.

641
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,490
There you go.
White people get it together.

642
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,740
No comment.
Ben Obrian in the conservative world has

643
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:26,340
to be careful.

644
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,070
This podcast could sink a ship on pro 
nuance.

645
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,893
Yeah.
How'd you come up with a shirt pro 

646
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,750
nuance?
I listened.

647
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,730
I think the way that I came up with it 
is because in the,

648
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:38,070
in the hunting world,
there is this,

649
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:38,904
speaking of conservative,
there's this like there's the 

650
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:42,780
conservative traditional district.
Yeah.

651
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,200
And there's the more progressive folks 
that you have met and been around.

652
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:49,320
You've been around both but be around 
both that are more environmentalist,

653
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,030
more public lands,
more access.

654
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:51,900
Right.
Um,

655
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,213
so there's kind of like to,
of course there's always two sides of 

656
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:55,524
politics,
but there's,

657
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,510
in this case,
two distinct sides,

658
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,403
right.
And the line kind of gets drawn around 

659
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:01,314
one a little bit around guns,
but also a little bit around the 

660
00:28:02,701 --> 00:28:07,170
environment.
So part of the biggest issue in politics

661
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:10,350
for a hunter angler right now is like,
I really like guns.

662
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,480
I like the second amendment.
I dig what's going on there.

663
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:13,314
I'd like to support that.
But what I also like is healthy 

664
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:18,570
ecosystems and environment and I don't 
know,

665
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:22,050
like habitat for wild game to live and 
public lands and access.

666
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,483
Well,
it just so happens that a lot of the a 

667
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:25,674
plus rated politicians for the NRA are 
like f minus or a plus rated in 

668
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,553
protecting wildlife and wild lands and a
lot of that's around extraction and 

669
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,993
different things like that,
but extraction of minerals and oil and 

670
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,290
natural reason for valuable lands.
Right.

671
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,310
So then change the way these lands are 
scheduled.

672
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,510
Like what?
What it's under?

673
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,583
Yeah.
I mean there was a lot of around 

674
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,200
monuments.
Of course that was one big one,

675
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:50,034
but it's just around like the general 
basis of even as a hunter but all 

676
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:54,324
Americans.
But as a hunter I'm faced with like I 

677
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:58,080
love wildlife,
I love wild places,

678
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:59,190
clean water,
clean land,

679
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,570
I'm all for that.

680
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,463
That's a huge part of what I believe in,
but I also believe in the second 

681
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:05,094
amendment.
I believe in my right to defend my 

682
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:06,684
family.
I believe in my rights to own firearms 

683
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:10,680
and to do that.
So I believe in those two things,

684
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:13,470
but because our politics are the way 
they are,

685
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,990
it doesn't leave room for those two 
beliefs.

686
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,490
When I'm at at the voting booth,
sometimes not all the time,

687
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:21,324
something is hardly leaves room for 
those beliefs in normal conversations 

688
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:25,974
with people,
unless you absolutely know that the 

689
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:32,121
person's going to be objective and as 
your shirt says pro nuance this,

690
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,403
the idea that you you shouldn't be able 
to defend your family is where it gets 

691
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:38,281
crazy.
Yeah.

692
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:40,830
It doesn't get crazy that you want to be
able to defend your family.

693
00:29:40,831 --> 00:29:42,190
Like why do these

694
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:47,190
movies all have robberies and break ins 
and bad guys?

695
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,590
Well,
why did you visit a real things?

696
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,513
That's a real thing.
So the idea that you should just be a 

697
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:58,291
sitting duck because there's so many 
crazy fucks out there that want to shoot

698
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:01,390
up schools and go on mass shootings that
somehow or another,

699
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,553
your being conflated with them year 
could be being confused with them or 

700
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,080
categorized with them.
Like how?

701
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,510
How has that that these are different 
things.

702
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,630
They both involve guns.
They are there things.

703
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,550
It's like the insole that drove all of 
those people in Toronto.

704
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:18,710
Member that.
Yep.

705
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,220
You know what?
If that keeps happening,

706
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:23,680
that's happened many times.
You've seen people kill people with cars

707
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:24,880
over the last few years.
It's been like

708
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,650
four or five big events.
Are they mutually exclusive?

709
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:28,484
Like I want to be able to defend my 
family and own firearms and have that 

710
00:30:30,891 --> 00:30:32,930
freedom.
That's a big part of this country,

711
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,240
but I also don't want people to die.
Exactly.

712
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,070
Mass shootings.
I don't want that.

713
00:30:37,071 --> 00:30:37,904
I want on the other side of the coin 
with you when it comes to environmental 

714
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:43,730
issues and around hunting,
public lands and things of that nature.

715
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,740
I want coal miners to have jobs.
I want people that work in an extraction

716
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:49,574
industries to have an opportunity to 
work and live in and do what they need 

717
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:53,504
to do,
but I also want to protect our 

718
00:30:55,131 --> 00:30:57,800
ecosystems at all costs because you 
can't replace that shit.

719
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,410
Right.

720
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,860
And there's gotTa be other jobs out 
there.

721
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,950
If the government put its resources 
instead to propping up old ways of doing

722
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:08,664
business that pollute the environment 
versus new ways of doing business with 

723
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,930
government programs,
that's entirely possible.

724
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:16,763
Yeah.
There are certainly reasonable and 

725
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,840
healthy ways to mine copper ore or 
waste.

726
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,190
I don't know.
There is.

727
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,160
I mean,
there's responsible ways to do that,

728
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:29,310
but at what?
At what cost?

729
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,990
You're still,
you're still extracting,

730
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,830
like you're still doing something,
do it.

731
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,120
You're still changing the natural 
environment there.

732
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,880
Yeah.
Someone was trying to make that argument

733
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:40,460
with fracking with me.
I was talking to them about that.

734
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,010
Is it Josh Fox's documentary?
What is he?

735
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:50,030
He was on the podcast,
the something fracking nation.

736
00:31:50,391 --> 00:31:51,140
What was his,
uh,

737
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,973
he made a,
it was a very good documentary and it 

738
00:31:53,961 --> 00:31:54,794
was when I had him on the podcast,
it was interesting because he seemed 

739
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,920
like he had been attacked a lot for it 
and even misunderstood,

740
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:01,754
like some of the questions I was asking 
that maybe they were coming from me and 

741
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:04,081
I was saying,
no,

742
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:05,720
this is just like,
what was it called?

743
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:08,870
Fragmentation.
What does it gasland that's it.

744
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,850
Oh yes.
Okay.

745
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,823
It's,
um,

746
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:14,690
it's disturbing.
You're watching some aspects of it,

747
00:32:14,691 --> 00:32:15,524
like when were wedding lighting their 
water on fire and then someone tried to 

748
00:32:17,751 --> 00:32:18,560
say,
oh,

749
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,870
there's some places where you've always 
been able to let your water on fire.

750
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,090
I was like,
okay,

751
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,430
did.
Okay.

752
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,013
Erica tradition of lighting a real 
argument that someone said that that's 

753
00:32:28,491 --> 00:32:30,020
not really from fracking,
and I said,

754
00:32:30,021 --> 00:32:30,854
okay,
these people said that there was no 

755
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,550
lighting.
The water on fire.

756
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,680
Then people started fracking.
The water smell like shit.

757
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:39,650
They started lighting a fire though.
You're saying those are connected.

758
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,930
Over the years,
Joe,

759
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:45,730
we've been able to light their water on 
fire for for a number of reasons,

760
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,010
but fourth of July

761
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,760
I would think to be confident about that
and I'm not confident about it,

762
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,760
but to be confident about what that guy 
said to me when he was saying that,

763
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:54,594
it's always been like that.
You would have to have done massive 

764
00:32:58,081 --> 00:33:01,440
research.
You would have to have spent time there.

765
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,393
You would have to been working either 
directly or indirectly with the 

766
00:33:05,671 --> 00:33:08,940
scientists that are collecting the data.
You'd have to get it from them.

767
00:33:08,941 --> 00:33:10,200
You'd have to know.
You'd have to see it.

768
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:15,201
You'd have to make sure or you have to 
be a person who is not interested in the

769
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:18,870
actual truth.
They just have an idea that they want to

770
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:23,010
push through and this is a weird thing 
with certain right wing folks.

771
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,203
There's a weird thing they want to push 
through that business is good and 

772
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:31,821
environmentalists are all pussies and 
hippies and Weirdos and losers and these

773
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:33,084
things don't jive in the world of 
someone who actually loves and 

774
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:38,520
appreciates the actual earth.
Of course,

775
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:39,510
man,
weird,

776
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,250
but

777
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,830
there is no way that anyone could argue,
right?

778
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:44,790
There's,
there's in the hunting world are sort of

779
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:49,070
like access and public land and all 
these things become a big deal,

780
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,640
but you can define access and a ton of 
different ways.

781
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,010
To me,
accessible to me,

782
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:58,580
access could be I like wilderness or to 
the only way you can access it,

783
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:01,070
his own foot via,
via trail head.

784
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,880
Someone else might say access to me is 
uh,

785
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,930
elderly folks or disabled folks fail and
to get on into a car and drive through a

786
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:12,050
road and public land or,
or get into an atv and drive.

787
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:17,110
And so politics being what they are.
Politicians take this term of access.

788
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,670
It happened around national monuments.
They take one side,

789
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:24,710
said the president of stealing your 
land,

790
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,700
and the other side says,
the president is giving back your land.

791
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,680
Somebody,
they're either,

792
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:33,080
both sides are full of shit or one of 
them is.

793
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,670
I remember when this came up,
Patagonia,

794
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:40,560
which is a giant company and doors had a
big ad on the Internet that said,

795
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,250
the president,
just so your land,

796
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,170
and then I heard Rinella talk about and 
he said this is,

797
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,360
I'm going to paraphrase,
but he basically said,

798
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:50,130
if you say that the presence until your 
land,

799
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,830
you're not being careful with your 
words.

800
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,860
Yes.
And you're not being,

801
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,260
you're being inflammatory.
Yes.

802
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,710
You're being absolutely inflammatory 
because it's not again,

803
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,050
that you were talking about grand 
staircase,

804
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:03,800
Escalante and bears ears National 
Monument bears ears being in Utah,

805
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,680
being explained to people what happened.
A boy.

806
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,000
Um,
I'll,

807
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,040
I'll do my best show.
Thank you Ben.

808
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,460
So,
so the antiquities act,

809
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:14,294
let's go back to the antiquities act to 
protect the antiquities act is to 

810
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:18,880
protect,
um,

811
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,340
culturally or socially,
emotionally,

812
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:23,174
culturally significant pieces of,
of land it all the way to the things 

813
00:35:26,781 --> 00:35:28,250
like the Grand Canyon.
Right?

814
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,860
And so spin it up to the end of,
there's a lot that I just skipped over,

815
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:36,500
but I'm going to spin it up to the end 
of the Obama administration.

816
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,010
President

817
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,010
Obama used his executive power to 
protect large swaths,

818
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:43,974
millions of acres around the brown bears
ears national monument to protect not 

819
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:49,674
only the,
the significant places for native 

820
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:56,571
Americans,
for native tribesman around bears ears,

821
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,283
but many millions of acres around that.
And so then it becomes the problem I 

822
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:04,740
have in the y that kind of,
that tee shirt exists.

823
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:06,930
It becomes a political football throw 
back and forth.

824
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,840
It's not at this point in time what's 
best for bears ears.

825
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,760
What's best for that National Monument 
was best for,

826
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,330
for it to be fairly owned,
what's best for the people,

827
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,193
the jobs,
the place it becomes what's best for 

828
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:26,120
each side and their rhetoric.
And so president trump asked secretary,

829
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:31,470
former secretary of Interior Ryan Zinky 
to review,

830
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,203
I think it was like 10 monuments to see 
if they should be reduced based on the 

831
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:38,700
productions that Obama had put put into 
place.

832
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,103
So he reviews these 10 monuments.
He cuts out eight of them and hones in 

833
00:36:43,921 --> 00:36:44,754
on two places,
bears ears and grand staircase 

834
00:36:47,011 --> 00:36:49,380
Escalante.
They then say,

835
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:51,960
we're going to reduce the size of these 
monuments.

836
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,853
When you say cuts out eight of them,
what do you mean by cuts out and they 

837
00:36:55,021 --> 00:36:56,790
review the other eight and say they're 
fine.

838
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,770
They're good to go.
No changes necessary.

839
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,050
Okay.
Some would say they did that as a,

840
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,033
as a straw men as eight straw men to 
knock them over and look at those other 

841
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:07,710
two.
They said we will reduce the.

842
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:11,460
The the area that is designated as a 
national monument,

843
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,703
and here again it comes to both sides.
They would say because the President 

844
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:22,290
Obama wheel,
that is his powers corruptly to protect,

845
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,183
to be as an environmentalist,
to protect lands that didn't need 

846
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:26,334
protected under the antiquities act 
because the antiquities act does say it 

847
00:37:29,431 --> 00:37:31,560
should be the smallest acreage possible 
to protect.

848
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,783
So now you get into stuff that I'm not 
an expert in or around the legal jargon 

849
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:38,730
and going back to things that were 
written in the 19 thirties,

850
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:45,020
but we get to a point where one side 
saying here is the Republicans trying to

851
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,683
shrink down these monuments so that they
can then go to the companies that are 

852
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,080
can then go and lease these places for 
mining,

853
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,550
but they can't currently do on their 
protections as a national monument.

854
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:04,320
The other side is saying we're trying to
protect culturally significant lands and

855
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:07,680
these millions of acres need protected.
Then you protect for lots of reasons,

856
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,830
so you end up with those two sides 
talking.

857
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:17,180
Now it's easy to sort of make a hype 
hyperbolic,

858
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,040
hyperbolic,
parabolic.

859
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,123
I always want to say that wrong.
Cut that back with hyperbolic argument 

860
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,100
one way or the other,
right?

861
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,650
Yeah.
I mean you could kind of exaggerate your

862
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:31,290
position one way or the other and it's 
being done that way.

863
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,423
It's been done that way.
Are they drilling there now or did he 

864
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,210
look.

865
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,043
Let's look that up,
but there is some leases that were that 

866
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,890
were approved for for bears ears.
I know for sure.

867
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,853
See,
that's one of the things where people 

868
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:46,150
talk about the president doesn't have 
any real power.

869
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,263
There's congress understand that and 
like really they have some checks and 

870
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:51,034
balances,
but there's the executive orders that 

871
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:53,920
can come down.
Listen,

872
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:54,754
I'm not the expert on this.
I'm sure I fumbled through some of the 

873
00:38:57,221 --> 00:38:58,060
details on that,
but.

874
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,690
But to me the bottom line is something 
like that,

875
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,980
why I like to to live in the centers 
because something like that becomes.

876
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,670
It becomes a thing that it becomes a pr 
hit.

877
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,593
Yeah.
It becomes a thing that people are 

878
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:12,514
throwing back there,
throwing bears ears back and forth 

879
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:16,420
because at the end of Obama's 
administration,

880
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,254
he made the designation and they've.
They repealed it or reversed it a year 

881
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,263
later.
Right?

882
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,310
Or some amount of time around a year 
later.

883
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,730
So it was only the way it was for a year
and everybody's making it.

884
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:29,410
Look,
government stole your land.

885
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,540
They just brought it back to exactly 
where it was before,

886
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,403
but they did open up the possibility,
which is why Obama did in the first 

887
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:35,830
place.
Yes.

888
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:36,663
They opened up the possibility for 
drilling and now they did resource 

889
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:41,350
extraction and that scares the shit out 
of people.

890
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,473
So like there's,
there's,

891
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,450
there's two.
They're in these situations.

892
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:47,284
There always seems to be spin on both 
sides and being a part of these debates 

893
00:39:52,151 --> 00:39:53,800
on a daily basis and being a part of 
this,

894
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,530
like bringing in this information on a 
daily basis.

895
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,860
It's tiresome.
You know,

896
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,140
you get tired,
you tired of being pandered to buy.

897
00:40:02,141 --> 00:40:07,141
People are tired of having to hear that 
this value system is right or this value

898
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:08,074
system is right and there's no room to 
be anywhere close to the center around 

899
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:11,104
this stuff.

900
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,730
So you just get is.
It's tiresome.

901
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,653
You know,
public lands are the only place where I 

902
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:18,250
look at it and say,
no,

903
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:19,084
you gotta leave that to the government.
You got to lead it to the federal 

904
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,210
government.
Don't,

905
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,580
don't let leave it to the states.
It's the only place.

906
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:25,490
I mean,
when I,

907
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,690
when I think about all the different 
things,

908
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:27,524
like with the legalization of marijuana 
and now they're going to legalize 

909
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:31,804
silicide and apparently in Oregon 
they're talking about doing that or 

910
00:40:33,761 --> 00:40:34,121
like,
yeah,

911
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:36,100
leave it to the states.
They should be able to vote that in.

912
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,190
They should be able to vote in like all 
the crazy laws.

913
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:42,400
You have weird states and some states 
have state taxes,

914
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:43,900
some states don't.
It's all good.

915
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,480
That's all good.
But when it comes to like federal land,

916
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:47,314
the problem is if these dates get into 
debt and this is what people need to 

917
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:51,190
understand,
they can sell it off.

918
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,650
Yeah,
so Utah is in debt.

919
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,460
Let's just.
I'm just not picking on Youtube,

920
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,990
but if they just for some reason,
they wind up in debt which states do all

921
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:03,991
the time and then they sell off a giant 
chunk of land to some oil company.

922
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:08,200
Now you can't camp there anymore.
You can and by the way,

923
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,350
that's your fucking land and not pay 
taxes.

924
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,780
UTAH.
That's your land.

925
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:16,360
You live in Arizona,
you live in Florida.

926
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,580
That's your land.
You live in Massachusetts.

927
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,330
It's yours.
That land in Utah is the whole fucking.

928
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,253
All of us.
They'll collected human race living on 

929
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:27,280
North America.
Listen to this,

930
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,310
listen to this shit.
This is like there's a guy named Senator

931
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:33,950
Mike Lee of the Great State of Utah,
which you rightly

932
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,330
put that all out of these things revolve
around the Utah for some reason.

933
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:41,150
Do they want.
They have a lot of the percentage of.

934
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,610
It's like something that's 70 percent of
their acreage is,

935
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,800
is controlled by the federal government.
That's why.

936
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,040
Plus Mormons.
Let me.

937
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:52,580
I'll take the first point.
You take got that.

938
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,310
So Senator Mike Lee Comes out and says,
right,

939
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:56,144
this is like the perfect,
the perfect way to spend this type of 

940
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:01,070
thing.
He starts,

941
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,933
he calls back to and Senator Orrin Hatch
from Utah has also done this call back 

942
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:06,764
to like the sagebrush rebellion and 
things like that calling back saying 

943
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:11,354
that wilderness is akin to the European 
aristocracy because only a certain few 

944
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:18,674
can go there because you have to have 
two working legs that can get you up 

945
00:42:22,221 --> 00:42:25,880
into wilderness.
Part of the basis of a speech he gave,

946
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:26,714
and it is given it several times,
is that public land and wilderness 

947
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:30,554
specifically is is akin to the the 
European aristocracy because only 

948
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:36,290
certain folks can go there.

949
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,930
If you would open up access cut roads 
through it,

950
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,890
then it would be for everyone,
so then it gets back to the semantics in

951
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:46,880
the spin and the things that politicians
push forward to try to convince you.

952
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:50,300
Well there still for you,
he's right in a certain way.

953
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:53,270
What he's right in is that if you put 
roads through,

954
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:56,300
anybody could go through anytime they 
wanted on a car.

955
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,970
If they had no legs,
he can barely walk.

956
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:01,940
If they are in a wheelchair normally,
but they can drive a car.

957
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:02,774
Yeah.
They can go in deep into the woods and 

958
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:06,990
they can enjoy all of the wilderness.
Sure.

959
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,320
The cast off that is true.
However,

960
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,503
did I.
it's not like there's a lot of places 

961
00:43:13,701 --> 00:43:14,534
that they can't also go to.
Theirs didn't go a lot of places where 

962
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:18,710
they can do that.
You can go to yellowstone,

963
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:20,330
yellowstone damn gorgeous.

964
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,163
You just drive through that and you see 
all the trees and the animals and 

965
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,440
yellowstone is a wonderful proxy for 
going outside.

966
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,293
Yeah.
It's an introduction to what it is 

967
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:29,390
without really being in it.
Yeah.

968
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:33,380
It's like a zoo that's free range is 
exactly what it is.

969
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,900
I live right.
I live an hour from there and I've taken

970
00:43:35,901 --> 00:43:39,050
my family there and it just feels like.
I used to feel like,

971
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,670
oh man,
this is an elicit place.

972
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,504
As somebody who's gone into the 
Wilderness and tackle these big 

973
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:47,700
challenges and hiked around and crazy 
places this yellowstone,

974
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,350
it's like,
Eh,

975
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,510
it makes me feel uncomfortable.
Then I.

976
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:51,343
Somebody said to me,
I feel like it was this guy named cody 

977
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:55,320
rich who has a podcast called the rich 
outdoors.

978
00:43:55,321 --> 00:43:57,110
He said to me,
it's like,

979
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:00,080
it's like it's.
I'm an ambassador for real wilderness.

980
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:01,603
It's like a way to present to people 
that this thing exists without them 

981
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:05,654
having to actually strap on a pack,
get some tracking poles and hike miles 

982
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:10,124
up into the wilderness.
This is part of the problem whenever 

983
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:17,180
you're talking about the wilderness is 
so few people go to it.

984
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,323
It's like if we were talking about the 
surface of Mars with the people that 

985
00:44:21,351 --> 00:44:22,610
create the rover,
well,

986
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:25,170
you know how the surface of Mars is it 
gums up the wheels,

987
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,190
it's read Stephen read how many people 
are going to Mars,

988
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,380
how many people are really going into 
the wilderness?

989
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,190
Yeah,
I mean not that many.

990
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:35,190
It's more people going to the wilderness
than Mars.

991
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,053
But I've always said like the,
the public lands movement in and I'm 

992
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,030
definitely part of it.
Um,

993
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,770
I feel like I could probably represented
the monument things better,

994
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:45,930
but like I,
I'm definitely part of it.

995
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:46,390
It,
it's,

996
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,230
it's scary and a little in a lot of ways
because people can say like,

997
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:50,064
keep it public man and keep it public.
That's just like apple pie and bald 

998
00:44:52,921 --> 00:44:53,754
eagles and freedom.
It's an idea that we all pay into a 

999
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:57,780
thing.
We all own.

1000
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,710
Anybody can go there.
It's super easy to get on that train.

1001
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,810
It is real easy to get on that train and
lose your critical thought around what,

1002
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,880
what is the idea of wilderness?
I mean,

1003
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:09,714
because when I think of my hunting now,
like when you first went hunting like 

1004
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:15,360
five or six years ago,
you would asked me this question.

1005
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,890
I would have given you a whole different
thing.

1006
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,680
What would you have said that?
I don't know what I would've said that,

1007
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:21,540
but not this answer.
I might've said like,

1008
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,920
well,
you fairly youngish man.

1009
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,040
I'm only growing in 30 1:33.
Oh,

1010
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:27,660
you're beautiful person.
Look at you.

1011
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,820
I love you too.
Perfect complexion.

1012
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,970
Look at you.
All your cells are firing correctly.

1013
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:36,350
The liver spots.
Yet this whiskey is really good stuff.

1014
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,940
I'm Irish.
I'm so.

1015
00:45:38,941 --> 00:45:41,160
What do you think you would have called 
it then?

1016
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:42,803
So what I probably would have said like 
when we first went hunting and NBC 

1017
00:45:46,391 --> 00:45:47,224
together from Moose,
what I probably would've said would've 

1018
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:49,973
been around,
it would have been less value based and 

1019
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,164
more like I do it because my dad did it.
I do it because it connects me to my 

1020
00:45:56,251 --> 00:45:57,930
dad.
Like my dad and my family.

1021
00:45:57,931 --> 00:45:58,764
My people.

1022
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,870
I do it because humanity did it.
We talked,

1023
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:02,970
we filmed a video.
Remember sitting on the thing,

1024
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,310
we talked a lot about our humanity,
right?

1025
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,144
Like the drawing back to the history of 
time when the hunter was exalted in a 

1026
00:46:11,881 --> 00:46:14,720
tribe of people was the only way to get 
me.

1027
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,573
It was the only way to get meat.
So your skills that you acquired as a 

1028
00:46:17,881 --> 00:46:20,640
hunter made you important to the 
culture,

1029
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:22,920
the society,
the everyday life.

1030
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,140
I would have probably called back to 
that.

1031
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:30,040
Not that I would say that's wrong now,
but what I've come to find out over some

1032
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,070
other years of,
of hunting and a lot of places is that I

1033
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:37,071
think my hunting is more about healthy 
ecosystems now than it is about anything

1034
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:38,334
else.
I think all of my efforts should be 

1035
00:46:42,241 --> 00:46:44,700
around clean water,
clean air,

1036
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:45,623
places that we can go and explore and 
what that brings to our world that 

1037
00:46:50,131 --> 00:46:50,964
brings more wildlife,
that brings places for my son to go and 

1038
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:57,000
experience these things.
And so I've changed over.

1039
00:46:57,001 --> 00:47:00,450
There's a very short time and the way 
that I do it well,

1040
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,450
the more you experienced the wilderness 
and then go back to the city and then go

1041
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:05,284
back to the wilderness,
the more you realize how special it is 

1042
00:47:06,731 --> 00:47:10,440
out there in the mall more you realize 
when like today I'm a.

1043
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:14,830
When I'm flying in a helicopter over la 
with my good friend Bill Burr,

1044
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,550
and as he was taking me up,
I was looking at all this development.

1045
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:19,384
We were talking about all these 
apartment complexes that are being 

1046
00:47:21,251 --> 00:47:22,180
developed and he's like,
yeah.

1047
00:47:22,181 --> 00:47:24,430
He goes,
you really see it when you're up here in

1048
00:47:24,431 --> 00:47:26,710
the air because you see where there was 
nothing.

1049
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,573
And then like a couple of weeks later 
it'll be flat now and then a couple of 

1050
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:31,330
weeks later they start construction and 
you realize like,

1051
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,193
oh,
this is how it spreads and that this is 

1052
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:36,290
just something that people do.
And if you don't put a star,

1053
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:37,740
put a line,
you know,

1054
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,850
draw a line.
We're going to keep going.

1055
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,590
We're going to make our way across the 
country.

1056
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:44,200
And I've heard that argument from people
that don't go to the wilderness,

1057
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,070
like Luco mature of the unit.
We don't overpopulated.

1058
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,930
Luke home went to the United States,
has no one living in it.

1059
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:50,943
Flyover who looked down at all the 
places that don't have cities and don't 

1060
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:55,600
have roads,
don't have houses like.

1061
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:56,201
Yeah,
yeah,

1062
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:57,430
yeah.
For now.

1063
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,840
You know that none of this shit was here
200

1064
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,230
years ago.
Cloud.

1065
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,353
We plowed ground to play the corn.
So you could have the things you have 

1066
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,740
well flyover.
No.

1067
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,813
Team 19,

1068
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,910
you know,
fly over 100,

1069
00:48:10,911 --> 00:48:12,080
200 years ago.
Bitch.

1070
00:48:12,081 --> 00:48:12,920
There was nothing here.

1071
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,680
Wilbur Wright norvell.
Come on,

1072
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,551
see what you saw.
But yeah,

1073
00:48:17,551 --> 00:48:19,930
if you get just go 300 years,
you have nothing.

1074
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,370
You have zero things.
Yeah.

1075
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,523
Well that's.
I think there's some perspective and I 

1076
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:24,664
think hunting has a lot going forward 
around the fact that has urbanization 

1077
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,470
happens.
You know,

1078
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:30,304
as jobs being for me,
like as jobs become more prevalent in 

1079
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:36,580
urban places and people have to travel 
from wherever they're growing up to,

1080
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:40,240
to these urban places in live so removed
from wilderness.

1081
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:42,920
So removed from sustainability,
um,

1082
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,530
I think for a long time because hunting 
peaked in 1982,

1083
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:48,603
there was like 17 point 5 million 
hunters around that year because of 

1084
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:56,290
Ronald Reagan was president.
He was president.

1085
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,371
I'm,
listen,

1086
00:48:57,371 --> 00:48:59,320
I'm,
I wasn't even alive so let's not,

1087
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,500
let's not do that shit.
I don't know.

1088
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,690
Um,
but like post World War II,

1089
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,480
there was a rise in the modern hunter 
mountain sport hunter,

1090
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:08,350
however you would describe it.

1091
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:10,143
There's that,
there's this rise in 1982 and then a 

1092
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:12,903
precipitous fall right from there until 
2016 was around 11 million hunters in 

1093
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:20,020
this country.
It's just a drop.

1094
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:20,883
It's a big drop in Iowa.
I always say that like the three things 

1095
00:49:23,831 --> 00:49:28,831
that I think happened or urbanization.
So people are getting removed from their

1096
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:33,910
getting moved away from having hunting 
in their lives on a daily basis.

1097
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,560
Not that they're anti hunting in any 
way,

1098
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:38,380
they're just getting removed from,
from that thing,

1099
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,140
getting your meat on your own.
They're removed from that.

1100
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,083
And a lot of times you removed from like
gardening and other types of shore 

1101
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,960
sustainable use things.
The other thing is Disney,

1102
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:48,363
like Walt Disney's a nice man,
but Bambi was not a good thing for our 

1103
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,150
collective psyche around hunting,
not just Bambi,

1104
00:49:55,151 --> 00:49:58,390
but essentially all cartoons involving 
animals to animals.

1105
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:00,510
Who your friends,
even predators,

1106
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:02,740
like Yogi was your friend.
He was your friend.

1107
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,830
He wore a tie bear attack and he had a 
hat on.

1108
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,820
He was at a picnic basket and you wanted
your picnic,

1109
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:10,610
Jamie.
Look up.

1110
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,370
There was a guy,
there was a dude.

1111
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,233
I'm recently.
He was caught poaching in Missouri and 

1112
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:18,560
the judge said that he had to,
um,

1113
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:22,000
watch Bambi once a month during his 
entire sentence.

1114
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:25,210
Why?
It's if you can find that that is real,

1115
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,100
that just needs a reality show.
I kind of know what to do,

1116
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,140
honey.
I know to do.

1117
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,280
We'll make.
It was Bambi he posted and dear.

1118
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,410
This is the guy like the whole other was
like a whole family.

1119
00:50:33,411 --> 00:50:35,930
Guys here we're in like a poaching ring 
or something.

1120
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,080
I read this on the way over here.
Um,

1121
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:39,943
here it is,
dear poacher sentence to watch Bambi 

1122
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:44,150
every month during the year.
Missouri jail.

1123
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,133
Yeah.
This might be a judge that's like 

1124
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:49,880
looking for a little,
nearly killed hundreds of deer sometimes

1125
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:52,360
taking over their heads and leaving the 
rest to rot and fields.

1126
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,593
Kate,
how about you keep that guy in jail for 

1127
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:56,930
more than a year.
There it is.

1128
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,760
Look at them.
David Barry Jr.

1129
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,713
Look at them.
Fucking dork has been ordered to watch 

1130
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:03,951
one thing,
man.

1131
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:07,460
If that guy was kiLling them because he 
was poor and he was just eating deer and

1132
00:51:07,461 --> 00:51:10,100
that's how he made his.
That's how he got food.

1133
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:11,180
That's not the case here.

1134
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,520
I don't care.
He chopped their heads off and just took

1135
00:51:13,521 --> 00:51:14,710
the head guy.
Just fuck.

1136
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:15,643
Fuck anybody who does that anyway,
for anybody who just wants to shoot 

1137
00:51:18,351 --> 00:51:21,680
something as damn delicious and massive 
as a deer,

1138
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:25,370
a deer could feed a family for months.
Do you understand?

1139
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,230
OF course it could.
You understand that,

1140
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:29,120
but I mean people listening or this 
asshole.

1141
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:29,983
Do you understand that?
This asshole who shot this fucking 

1142
00:51:31,401 --> 00:51:33,620
thing,
hunDred deer head off you piece of shit.

1143
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:38,750
I'm patricia can look forward to eating 
deer and you shot it and you.

1144
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,280
Yeah.
Anyway,

1145
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:41,114
back back like walt disney,
I think like that kind of treatment of 

1146
00:51:45,591 --> 00:51:47,750
animals as has been something that's 
hurt honey.

1147
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:50,840
And the third one is hunters.
I've heard themselves like that guy.

1148
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,320
Like maybe that's poetry is way worse.
that's a poetry.

1149
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:56,810
Not 100 though,
but he's a guy who hunting illegally.

1150
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,600
Poaching is.
He's on her.

1151
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,170
Yeah,
but like camping.

1152
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:01,530
Camping illegally.
he's trespassing.

1153
00:52:01,531 --> 00:52:02,520
Not.
It's not the same.

1154
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:03,830
Yeah,
but you're camping.

1155
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,800
You're trespassing and camping.
CampIng,

1156
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:06,643
or maybe he's.
I know you don't want to call them a 

1157
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:09,041
hunter.
Like you know,

1158
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:12,830
like someone who who goes on stage at a 
company.

1159
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:14,870
Picnic is not a comedian.
Yes,

1160
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,430
it's the same thing.
I get it.

1161
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,830
He's still killing the animals.
Yeah,

1162
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,900
he's killed more than me.
That it's 100.

1163
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:21,783
Yeah.
I'm a hunter and he's killed more than 

1164
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:24,140
the fishing exposure.
that's true.

1165
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,530
This is a piece of shit.
He is just like everything else,

1166
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:28,364
man.
There's people that are good uber 

1167
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,104
drivers and there's some that'll try to 
pull you under a bridge and fuck your 

1168
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:34,650
mouth.
This is bad people.

1169
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,710
That's a good point to bring up.
Like is there,

1170
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:39,020
is there a time like I always bring up 
with hunting,

1171
00:52:39,021 --> 00:52:39,980
it's like,
oh,

1172
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,670
somebody killed a giraffe or somebody,
a guy killed a family,

1173
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:45,380
baboons and made and did a photo.

1174
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,700
I saw that.
Do you see that?

1175
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,770
It was not good.
Not good.

1176
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,850
It's a fucking primate bro.
Yeah,

1177
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,550
I mean there's nothing good about that 
with the,

1178
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,570
that never going to go well for you.
It's never going to go well for you.

1179
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:58,490
Did he put it online?
No,

1180
00:52:58,491 --> 00:52:59,324
he didn't put it online is I guess the 
credit that would give the guy who put 

1181
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:03,044
it online,
the Idaho statesman or whatever the 

1182
00:53:05,451 --> 00:53:07,910
Idaho local favorite was the picture.
I don't know,

1183
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,830
probably from one of the folks he sent 
an email,

1184
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:13,400
a mass email out to friends and 
colleagues and things of like recapping.

1185
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:18,050
Recapping is hunt in africa.
Like here's all the things I did and he,

1186
00:53:18,051 --> 00:53:20,900
I think from my reading on the guy,
the guy,

1187
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:21,823
um,
and I got a lot of mutual friends with 

1188
00:53:22,671 --> 00:53:24,410
him.
So he's a good guy.

1189
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,440
Like you just screwed up.

1190
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:29,160
Maybe they made a bad choice.
That's a tough sell.

1191
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:30,203
I would say so too,
but I should put him in a cell and make 

1192
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,860
some monkey movies.
I think he knew,

1193
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:35,723
like if I put this,
if I put this spin up after this planet 

1194
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:43,554
of the apes,
you gotta watch the mark walberg planet 

1195
00:53:44,761 --> 00:53:45,594
of the apes,

1196
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,793
the reality of baboons and I have.
I've studied the work of robert 

1197
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:52,014
sapolsky,
who's a guy who's been on the podcast 

1198
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:56,850
before and it's really pretty amazing 
stuff.

1199
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:57,983
What they found out about baboons,
he studied actually because he actually 

1200
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:04,770
studied a baboon tribe that the alpha 
males died off.

1201
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,620
They were all eating out of a poisoned 
garbage patch.

1202
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:12,690
There was a garbage patch to the sick 
food in it and I'm just bad food.

1203
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,510
And the alpha males who got to eat 
first,

1204
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,050
uh,
always chased her,

1205
00:54:17,051 --> 00:54:21,210
but they wound up dying off.
And for more than one generation,

1206
00:54:21,211 --> 00:54:22,044
I think it was several generations.
They became like really peaceful and 

1207
00:54:25,651 --> 00:54:26,484
calm and they weren't the vicious 
violent baboons that are the norm and 

1208
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:33,540
that it's really,
if you google it,

1209
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:38,280
a supple ski studies baboons and I radio
lab also had a podcast about it,

1210
00:54:38,281 --> 00:54:39,114
which is where I first heard about it 
and then I read what paul wrote about 

1211
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:43,074
it,
but it is unbelievably fascinating and 

1212
00:54:44,191 --> 00:54:49,191
shows how you can have this insane 
violent animal culture and then the,

1213
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:54,720
the clients get removed and when the 
cops get removed,

1214
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:57,510
everybody chills the fuck out and it's 
really,

1215
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,830
really quite fascinating.

1216
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:00,143
BuT I'm baboons for the most part.
I mean maybe he shot the nicest 

1217
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:05,370
prevalence ever,
but for the most part they're a bunch of

1218
00:55:05,371 --> 00:55:07,920
baby cunts and they'll steal your 
fucking kid.

1219
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:09,570
That was a two year old that you love so
dearly.

1220
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:13,140
That little motherfucker be on a porch 
somewhere and if there's baboons around,

1221
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,420
they'll snatch him.
You need his head.

1222
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,860
When I was in africa,
a hundred africa one time in my life and

1223
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:22,950
the ph and our guide both said at our 
church as a professional hunter,

1224
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:23,823
right?
The structure is like there's a 

1225
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,520
professional hunter,
which is essentially your guide and then

1226
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:30,540
there's trackers which are usually 
native folks that that help tracking the

1227
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:32,070
game spot in the animals,
things like that.

1228
00:55:32,071 --> 00:55:33,450
BuT our,
our ph,

1229
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:35,580
he was like,
if you see a bad beer and shoot it,

1230
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:36,873
it's like we have,
we have lots of irrigation here to 

1231
00:55:38,281 --> 00:55:42,570
maintain this ranch and they rip it up 
and they're basically terrorists around,

1232
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,490
you know,
coming around our camp,

1233
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:46,620
mess with our fires,
messing with our food.

1234
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:48,063
If you see one sheet one,
and that was the instruction that I got 

1235
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,160
and I never,
never did.

1236
00:55:53,161 --> 00:55:53,994
But you know,
gIven that instruction from somebody 

1237
00:55:56,551 --> 00:55:57,030
like that,
like,

1238
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,770
hey,
this is a good thing for our landscape.

1239
00:55:58,890 --> 00:55:59,723
Go and do it now.
That's very far removed from stacking 

1240
00:56:01,711 --> 00:56:02,300
them up.

1241
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,133
Yeah,
like stack very far in with a big smile 

1242
00:56:05,951 --> 00:56:06,641
on your face.
Hold on.

1243
00:56:06,641 --> 00:56:07,474
A bow

1244
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:08,973
isn't.
It?

1245
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,240
Doesn't make denise shoot a baby that 
has some babies.

1246
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:13,930
It's like a whole family.
How you can.

1247
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,770
They don't stay in one place either.
You guys,

1248
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,350
you and I said like,
listen joe,

1249
00:56:17,351 --> 00:56:20,140
here's my plan.
What I'm going to do is go to africa and

1250
00:56:20,141 --> 00:56:23,640
hunt and then,
you know,

1251
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:23,980
like I'm going

1252
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,000
to shoot some baboons.
I mean,

1253
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:26,290
it's a good thing for this.
I'd be like,

1254
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,280
don't tell anybody.
Yeah.

1255
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:28,000
You'd be like,
don't,

1256
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,833
don't take.
Certainly don't take a photo of you 

1257
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:33,160
posing with an entire family of the 
deceased primate.

1258
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:36,820
I had a friend who was in africa and he 
got attacked by a ba boom,

1259
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:37,723
boom,
ba boom,

1260
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,593
steals food.
I forgot what the context of it was was 

1261
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:43,930
uh,
quite a few years ago.

1262
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,990
But he said it was spooky.
He said they don't seem like a,

1263
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:50,980
a monkey and they don't seem like they 
seem like a dog monkey.

1264
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,940
Electric wild.
You ever see when they open their mouth?

1265
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:59,650
Yes.
It's like a dog mouth monkey.

1266
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,430
It's like a dog fucked a monkey.
Like if you really like show a baboons,

1267
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,400
baboons with his mouth open.
Never thought of it that way,

1268
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:07,234
but I'll give it to you.
But they have a long stretched out 

1269
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:10,300
mouth,
like a wolf or something.

1270
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,920
It's not like a werewolf.
Yeah.

1271
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:15,670
It's not like a regular person.
The real weird man,

1272
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,180
they,
they,

1273
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,120
they have all these characteristics that
are of primates,

1274
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:20,223
but then they have this extra weirdness 
to them and this wildness tune to it 

1275
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,270
doesn't have come down to like the core 
of days.

1276
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:27,400
Oh my god.
I mean,

1277
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:28,330
come on,
look at that.

1278
00:57:28,331 --> 00:57:29,650
That's like a werewolf.
Yeah,

1279
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:33,670
that is a werewolf that's like part.
Look at that.

1280
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:38,450
Face that lion roll back.
But look at the,

1281
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,390
even the shape of the jaw.
It's very dog.

1282
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:46,000
Like it's very elongated and,
and dog like they're very.

1283
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:49,780
It's a very strange animal.
Look at that face man.

1284
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:53,320
And that is a crazy beast.
And my friend said,

1285
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:56,190
I forget the story was quite a long time
ago,

1286
00:57:56,191 --> 00:58:00,460
but I stole some food and snarled at him
and snatch something from.

1287
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,220
But he said it was very scary.

1288
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,500
He said,
and you know,

1289
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:08,100
it wasn't even that big with like 60,
70 pounds or something like that.

1290
00:58:08,101 --> 00:58:09,310
And he said,
but it's pending.

1291
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,230
They'll fuck you up.
They'd say,

1292
00:58:11,231 --> 00:58:12,230
well,
you know,

1293
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,900
it's different if you live in around 
them.

1294
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:14,873
It's Just these things are different.
Like we were talking about around the 

1295
00:58:17,531 --> 00:58:20,440
old media to incorporate officers the 
other day around how do you,

1296
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:24,160
how do we as hunters who are around 
these animals all the time and shit,

1297
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,740
how do we.
Then something happens.

1298
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:29,070
Somebody gets mad about this guy killing
all these,

1299
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:29,993
these baboons.
What do we say when there's a hunting 

1300
00:58:32,381 --> 00:58:34,820
scandal?
You why said,

1301
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:35,920
oF course I let it go.
Well,

1302
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,870
most people don't even know about it.
Yeah,

1303
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:41,890
it is world,
but that one was on like nbc,

1304
00:58:41,891 --> 00:58:42,870
cnn,
this one,

1305
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:43,743
this one was pretty big and there's.
There's invariably these things happen 

1306
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:47,854
where,
how come that didn't go as big as cecil 

1307
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,900
stop and think about that because to me 
it's more,

1308
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,310
it's more kind of fucked up.

1309
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:58,270
It's more egregious than the cecil thing
was an it's a normal thing,

1310
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,340
but I think I just think we're 
desensitized to it.

1311
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:04,510
Cecil came in at a time where there was 
more sensitivity to it and it just hit a

1312
00:59:04,511 --> 00:59:05,344
new cycle like trump.
The trump news cycle probably dominates 

1313
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,530
any other thing that happens in the 
news.

1314
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:13,603
Well,
the reason why I say that cecil's 

1315
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:15,760
normal,
I don't think that it's good.

1316
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:19,210
I don't think you should just go over 
there and shoot lines,

1317
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:20,583
but people been doing it forever.
Like if you asked me how many people go 

1318
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:26,510
over there to hunt baboons and be like,
do they really?

1319
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:28,640
Is that like a normal thing?
Like does.

1320
00:59:28,641 --> 00:59:30,140
It doesn't seem normal.
Right?

1321
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:31,363
Like even though I don't,
I mean I've had this conversation many 

1322
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:34,514
times on this podcast,
I don't think you should shoot things 

1323
00:59:36,231 --> 00:59:37,064
that you don't eat unless there's a need
in terms of like some sort of an 

1324
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:43,490
imbalance,
like just as a joke.

1325
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,950
Imagine if eagles were like rats.
They were everywhere.

1326
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:52,620
There's a reason why you could just kill
rats because you have to,

1327
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,190
okay,
this is what overpopulation looks like.

1328
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:56,024
You,
you put a trap in your fucking garage 

1329
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:00,950
and you smash the head of this living 
creature and you're happy.

1330
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:03,890
Almost all things are categorized as 
road until you do that too.

1331
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,480
Well,
not true.

1332
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:06,141
Really.
Right?

1333
01:00:06,141 --> 01:00:08,210
Like squirrels are cute.
They're adorable,

1334
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,840
but they just don't get in your house.
But if they were getting,

1335
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:11,674
there is half a dozen squirrels in your 
garage and you could set traps and get 

1336
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:15,200
them out of there.
You would.

1337
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,093
But it's a different thing.
Like you would feel bad if you stomped 

1338
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:19,690
one.
Probably I wouldn't.

1339
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,790
You'd stomp a rat like people still.
You've saw a rat in your kid's room.

1340
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:26,180
You'd fucking stump that thing to death 
twice,

1341
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,213
right?
If you saw a squirrel and your kids are 

1342
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:30,530
a blanket over it,
those types of value.

1343
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:33,130
Why don't we apply those value systems 
to animals like that?

1344
01:00:33,131 --> 01:00:33,964
What?
Because they're overpopulated and 

1345
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,880
because traditionally there have been 
carriers have plague.

1346
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,960
Will the real,
the real story about the black plague.

1347
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:43,490
It's not just that the rats were 
carrying,

1348
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:44,324
but in fact that the ticks and the was 
it ticks or fleas that were on the rats 

1349
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:53,360
were carrying the black plague.
If I want to say it's fleas,

1350
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,640
could be.
And that this was how the bubonic plague

1351
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,080
got spread.
It got spread actually,

1352
01:00:57,081 --> 01:00:57,914
in fact,
through the ticks that were carried by 

1353
01:00:59,091 --> 01:00:59,990
the rats.
That what it is.

1354
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:00,893
Fleas.
Fleas.

1355
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:03,500
I'm.
Thank you jane with google search.

1356
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,000
The,
uh,

1357
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:05,983
the difference is that squirrels are not
overpopulated and that raptors are 

1358
01:01:09,051 --> 01:01:10,910
killing them off,
like left and right.

1359
01:01:10,911 --> 01:01:14,660
It's a primary source of food for a lot 
of these flying raptors,

1360
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,960
eagles and hawks and stuff like that.

1361
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,090
I'm sure a lot of other things eat them 
too,

1362
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,640
but there's enough balance out there.
But rats,

1363
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,520
rats lock into us.
I mean,

1364
01:01:25,521 --> 01:01:28,250
they lived without us for a long time,
but once they found us,

1365
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:28,820
they were like,
oh,

1366
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:29,653
look at this shit.
These dumb mother fuckers have holes in 

1367
01:01:31,281 --> 01:01:33,620
their ground.
You can live under their houses.

1368
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,710
He just,
they put garbage out every day.

1369
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,250
Just go jack.
They're garbage.

1370
01:01:37,251 --> 01:01:38,750
You got plenty of food.
This is,

1371
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:42,260
will he treat all types of animals very 
differently,

1372
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,123
right?
And we apply our own specific feelings 

1373
01:01:46,641 --> 01:01:50,120
about these animals to them.
Like the bear with the name doesn't know

1374
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:53,870
that it has a name.
The wolf or the name doesn't know it has

1375
01:01:53,871 --> 01:01:54,704
a name.
It's not aware that we've applied this 

1376
01:01:57,441 --> 01:02:01,800
special meaning to it.
It doesn't know that it's still our,

1377
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:05,420
our application of our feelings and our 
engendering this.

1378
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:08,870
That doesn't change the nature of the 
wolf or the bear.

1379
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:12,440
It will rip your face off.
It will kill as many elk as it can.

1380
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,603
Well,
there's a real problem in depicting 

1381
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:15,434
them,
the anthropomorphization of animals to 

1382
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:20,310
picks them as your friends and that's a 
hard thing to shake.

1383
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,713
There's not that they're bad and this is
where the real problem with someone 

1384
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:26,640
going around shooting baboons and posing
like you did.

1385
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:29,940
A great thing is it's not that these 
animals are bad.

1386
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:32,360
They should be respected and understood 
and appreciate.

1387
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:33,203
Now,
if you are a part of a baboons cleanup 

1388
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:37,310
crew,
like if you're winning.

1389
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,144
I was listening to rainelle is podcast 
today and they were talking about 

1390
01:02:42,151 --> 01:02:42,984
kangaroos in Australia and that there 
was a guy on the show that had killed 

1391
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:49,890
somewhere near was like 7,000,
many thousands,

1392
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,840
thousands like his dad's.
There was a.

1393
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,520
What was it like?
There was a flood.

1394
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:55,800
I'll probably mess this up.
There is some sort of weather event that

1395
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:56,634
pushed all these kangaroos onto to his 
dad's ranch and his dad was going out 

1396
01:02:58,621 --> 01:02:59,454
every day and just whacking at nauseum 
thousands of rows and that they have to 

1397
01:03:03,091 --> 01:03:05,220
do this because they don't have any 
natural predators and they.

1398
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,940
They'll just devastate landscapes and 
we've played videos.

1399
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,920
Cvfi one real quick.
We'll play.

1400
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:13,950
We'll get kicked off of youtube probably
right.

1401
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:18,120
There's a video of like a swarm of 
kangaroos in Australia.

1402
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:18,810
Did I have?
No,

1403
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:21,120
I had no idea.
We were reading about it,

1404
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:22,800
about the overpopulation.
I had no idea.

1405
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:26,070
It's just like hundred pound locust.
Yeah,

1406
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,110
that's what I was reaDing.
I can't remember the guy's name,

1407
01:03:28,111 --> 01:03:30,060
but I was reading this paper just so I 
can see.

1408
01:03:30,061 --> 01:03:33,060
It was reading.
Don't put it up on the youtube.

1409
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,890
I don't want the kids to get out of.
There it is.

1410
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,330
this is nothing.
This ain't.

1411
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:39,480
This ain't shit in comparison.
This is pretty great.

1412
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:40,314
Yeah.
These are all boobs.

1413
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,453
This is pretty crazy,
but we were watching one when there was 

1414
01:03:44,281 --> 01:03:46,440
a swarm running across a field.
Like,

1415
01:03:46,441 --> 01:03:47,910
look at that bro.
That's rats.

1416
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:48,960
Come on,
man,

1417
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,720
if you saw that many rats in a field,
you would go,

1418
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:55,560
I am going to go get my gun and I'm 
going to kill these fucking rats.

1419
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:57,210
Right?
YOu wouldn't tolerate that,

1420
01:03:57,211 --> 01:03:58,044
but these are cute.
Is it like the endangered species act 

1421
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,513
coming into play here and in a weird way
because these are caring for animals 

1422
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,330
dictated by the number of the animal 
that there is.

1423
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,130
It isn't an.
It is.

1424
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,420
See,
it's not for us.

1425
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,313
right?
We're over here in the valley of 

1426
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:15,590
southern California and right brains.

1427
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,160
Have a good old time.
Me buddy.

1428
01:04:17,161 --> 01:04:19,830
Ben o'brian,
young jamie have wonderful.

1429
01:04:19,831 --> 01:04:22,200
It's air conditioned with fantastic 
fairness.

1430
01:04:22,201 --> 01:04:24,660
We live a good life here.
If you're in Australia,

1431
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:25,800
you're killing those.
Fuck.

1432
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:26,663
Oh,
let me tell you.

1433
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,620
When I went,
remy warren,

1434
01:04:28,621 --> 01:04:31,680
our mutual friend first took me to New 
Zealand.

1435
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:34,380
He took me to a sheep station,
a giant that's basicallY a ranch,

1436
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,420
big sheep ranch.
We hunted fallow deer,

1437
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:40,920
the deer everywhere.
On the way out.

1438
01:04:40,921 --> 01:04:44,870
We met a guy,
we call him the rabbit man or like he.

1439
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,323
He looked like a superhero.
He was riding on like a just a two 

1440
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:52,080
stroke bike with like a rabbit hide 
covers for the handles.

1441
01:04:52,081 --> 01:04:54,380
He had a helmet on.
he was like a superhero,

1442
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:58,310
like a leather jacket and was like a 22 
and he was riding around.

1443
01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:02,370
His job was to ride around and shoot 
rabbits all night long every day,

1444
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:03,510
seven days a week.

1445
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:06,840
He had killed millions of rabbits,
millions,

1446
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,370
millions and he.
He would log every night,

1447
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:10,620
come back and log the number of rabbIts 
he killed.

1448
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:14,490
They weren't eating these rabbits.
It was population control.

1449
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:19,420
These robots were or digging under these
rabbits were destroying the landscape.

1450
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:20,254
They couldn't run sheep.
That the land was invaluable because 

1451
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:25,990
these rabbits where it's almost like 
turn of the century America.

1452
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:27,383
We had some of the same situations,
but we met this guy who's job it was to 

1453
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,650
with impunity.
Kills many rabbits as he possibly could.

1454
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:39,070
A rabbit's invasive species down there.
They might be.

1455
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:39,993
Yeah,
we'll find out because this was New 

1456
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,730
Zealand and most like there's 
everything.

1457
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,320
Almost everything is non native and this
is a crazy spot.

1458
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,690
Yeah.
That's one of my favorite spots.

1459
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:52,300
I can be on the board for tourism for 
New Zealand.

1460
01:05:52,301 --> 01:05:53,134
Really?
You're allowing the rabbits were 

1461
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:55,720
introduced to Australia and 18th 
hundred.

1462
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,740
Okay.
But what about New Zealand?

1463
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:03,250
Jamie?
Not paying attention right next to right

1464
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,380
next to.
I can't swim bro.

1465
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:08,560
Rapid on swim,
but I bet it's the same thing.

1466
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:10,310
Whereas the same thing.
I'm sure we never,

1467
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:11,223
we never did get so deep into an 
invasive species and number introduced 

1468
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,330
rabbit.
European rabbit.

1469
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:17,351
Yeah.
They,

1470
01:06:17,351 --> 01:06:21,950
I think everything in in New Zealand was
introduced most most.

1471
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:22,803
Sorry.
New zealanD really needs to kill these 

1472
01:06:24,281 --> 01:06:25,720
adorable rabbits.
yeah.

1473
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:27,190
They have to.
By the way.

1474
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,930
You can eat them.
They're fucking dogs.

1475
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,450
Rabbits are delicious.
Yeah.

1476
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:31,623
I mean it's.
But at the problem as my daughter has a 

1477
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:34,360
fucking pet rabbit.
Okay.

1478
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:35,493
And uh,
we put it in this little cute cage and 

1479
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:41,670
when it wants to come out and be held 
and puts his little paws on tissue,

1480
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,970
did it makes noise.
You opened the cage up,

1481
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:46,540
take the rabbit out,
you know.

1482
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,520
But it was delicious.
It can't go out and.

1483
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:49,660
Fuck,
I love hunting rabbits,

1484
01:06:49,661 --> 01:06:51,160
man.
Malicious.

1485
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,840
But I was reading this,
this,

1486
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:54,250
uh,
environmental.

1487
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:55,084
It was like a theorist.
This guy was talking about the types of 

1488
01:06:56,771 --> 01:06:58,380
hunting and I was reading this.
I'm like,

1489
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,250
this is not,
this might be a smart guy,

1490
01:07:00,251 --> 01:07:01,084
but he don't have it.
He was talking about three types of 

1491
01:07:04,151 --> 01:07:05,770
hunting.
Therapeutic.

1492
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:07,003
What is that?
James was in That period with the 

1493
01:07:08,621 --> 01:07:09,960
rabbits.
It said stoats.

1494
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:11,300
Stoked.
I've never heard of it.

1495
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:13,870
It's keating.
It's eating a nested bird.

1496
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:14,883
Probably another cute.
But except for one of the things that 

1497
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,220
also I learned about from the mediator 
podcast is a,

1498
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:25,390
how many squirrels kill birds?
Oh yeah.

1499
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:26,283
They kill and eat birds.
I think that's a big part of the 

1500
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:33,200
decimation of the population of certain 
bird species is squirrel.

1501
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,300
I'm interested in this.

1502
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:37,060
Literally eats fucking mice.
He's a murderer.

1503
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,760
That's crazy.
That little thing.

1504
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:41,740
Eat a mouse.
that's about what's a rat?

1505
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,370
it's a rat.
That's like his size.

1506
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:47,110
Is this something that's on New Zealand?
I think.

1507
01:07:47,111 --> 01:07:49,750
I believe so.
I've done murder.

1508
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:52,420
Only thing I've run into that was native
to New Zealand was a kia.

1509
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:53,363
It was like a parrot that flies around.
Was the thylacine native to New Zealand 

1510
01:07:56,651 --> 01:07:58,870
or Australia?
That's Australia,

1511
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,760
right?
That's the tasmanian tiger.

1512
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:04,180
Or also known as your total weasel?
He's nine ounces.

1513
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,960
Just America.
North America is just how little fuckers

1514
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:10,540
out here and stuff.
Oh,

1515
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:11,770
okay.
got over here.

1516
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:15,110
Distinguished by.
Oh,

1517
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,093
he's a weasel.
It looks like a larger size and longer 

1518
01:08:18,591 --> 01:08:22,100
tail with a prominent black tip.
It's kind of weasel was terrific.

1519
01:08:22,101 --> 01:08:22,934
Level of carnivorous.
Isn't it funny that weasels are thought 

1520
01:08:24,861 --> 01:08:26,600
to be like a little bitches?
You little weasel.

1521
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,760
We're bad ass.
This weasel.

1522
01:08:28,761 --> 01:08:29,660
There he goes.
Look at him.

1523
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,540
Yeah.
And weasels will fuck up a cobra.

1524
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:34,420
How about that?
Look at him.

1525
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:38,210
What does he do in the hills and rabbit?
That's how he's killing.

1526
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,820
Look at it.
Kills rabbit 10 times its size.

1527
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,530
Its christ.
2 million views.

1528
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,310
There it is.
Oh there it is.

1529
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,100
Look how small he is and he's chasing a 
rabbit.

1530
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:49,934
That's insane.
What a little ruthless motherfucker 

1531
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:55,640
probably on like don't show it,
but it was very cute.

1532
01:08:55,641 --> 01:08:58,190
So should we do the play by play on like
stout?

1533
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:02,330
Oh,
life stout kills rabbit 10 times a stoat

1534
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:04,220
or I don't know.
It was.

1535
01:09:04,221 --> 01:09:05,320
It stowed her style.
I don't know.

1536
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:08,480
I'd rather this of my time outside 
fucker.

1537
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,170
Look at him.
Go.

1538
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:11,260
He really is 10 times the size.
He's.

1539
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:14,350
He's kind of adorable though.
The way they doing it.

1540
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,670
What's he going to do?
He's going to go for the hindquarters,

1541
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:18,523
like a wolf.
The other rabbit to stop him because 

1542
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,430
like captain,
save a hoe over there.

1543
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,870
I mean this one.
Oh.

1544
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,100
Oh,
that's some pass by.

1545
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:25,983
Was going low.
How about the other rabbit just sits 

1546
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:28,070
there was friends.

1547
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:30,760
Gets just dozens of rabbits that aren't 
like,

1548
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:33,890
let's gang up and get this dope man.
How crazy Is he?

1549
01:09:33,891 --> 01:09:37,210
Doesn't try the really close to him.
Now.

1550
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:38,150
He goes,
where's he going?

1551
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:41,240
Is he going like,
so he's Probably going to hit those.

1552
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:42,143
He's going to hit those hind quarters.
You're going to get some shock and some 

1553
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:46,670
blood loss.
Now he's gone.

1554
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:47,773
He's gone again.
He's going to pull them down with the 

1555
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:51,230
blood loss and you get,
you know,

1556
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,890
he's going,
oh joe rogan.

1557
01:09:52,891 --> 01:09:54,410
He's going up.
Oh god.

1558
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:58,040
Oh my god.
Back look at the other rabbits.

1559
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,650
What's going on?
It was like,

1560
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:01,080
this doesn't seem right.
The other rabbits.

1561
01:10:01,081 --> 01:10:03,620
It just going to look away you pussy.
We're not friends that are going to help

1562
01:10:03,621 --> 01:10:05,780
your friend.
what a little monster.

1563
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:08,420
Oh,
that is so crazy.

1564
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:11,750
He's deep on it.
That is so he's got his teeth for those.

1565
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:12,583
I don't know who's watching,
but he's got his teeth like behind the 

1566
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:15,074
ears of this random.
He's killing it by biting the back of 

1567
01:10:17,871 --> 01:10:21,320
his neck and he literally is 10 times 
smaller than that.

1568
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:23,720
Is it dead right there or the other?
I was like,

1569
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:27,650
thank you bbc fucking dorks help your 
friend.

1570
01:10:27,651 --> 01:10:32,651
that's why you're going to go extinct.
You fucking bastard.

1571
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:38,420
How about you bitch?
Turning them a bite him in the neck.

1572
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:44,270
It really is that they're stout.
You think s t o a t e s it seems like it

1573
01:10:47,361 --> 01:10:49,040
would be stout,
you know,

1574
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:51,460
but uh,
you would be stout and stout.

1575
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:57,100
A stalled backwards stout.
Never seen one of those before.

1576
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:58,960
MY time outside.
Never heard of.

1577
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:00,093
Never heard.
No.

1578
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,830
I didn't even know it wAs a thing too 
though.

1579
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,730
They're savage,
next thing you know they're going to be,

1580
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,010
they're going to be like nipping at your
calf trying to take you down.

1581
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:10,850
That should be the american animal,
not an eagle weasels in Ireland and here

1582
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:11,684
I go.
Everywhere else they're called short 

1583
01:11:12,321 --> 01:11:14,310
tailed weasels kind of weasel

1584
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,490
ways.
Those are vicious little motherfuckers.

1585
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,200
That's what I'm saying.
Like why are weasels like the wheat?

1586
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:23,430
So think about like pauly shore.
When he would do the weasel,

1587
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:25,790
you thought of him.
We'd sell in.

1588
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:28,860
He didn't think of him as being a 
ruthless killer or something 10 times.

1589
01:11:28,861 --> 01:11:31,860
And those are cute.
Like if pauly shore was taken down,

1590
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:33,900
giant bitches,
huge,

1591
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,360
25 feet tall.
Women.

1592
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:38,370
I just smashing them,
you know,

1593
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,690
like that would be what

1594
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,213
little animal.
But that even the way that that little 

1595
01:11:44,311 --> 01:11:46,130
weasel was chasing the rabbit was kind 
of cute.

1596
01:11:46,131 --> 01:11:49,020
like he Was just bounding along,
adore in adorable.

1597
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,780
It was aDorable.
So he would run by.

1598
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,653
He was so mean.
He would run by the other rabbits like 

1599
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,233
he had determined about this rabbit.
This brings up like we were on my 

1600
01:11:57,661 --> 01:11:58,494
podcast.
We had a guy on there named brandy 

1601
01:11:59,571 --> 01:12:00,800
newburgh.
You know about that,

1602
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:01,703
randy?
Yeah.

1603
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:03,090
Randy Is awesome.
Yeah,

1604
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,033
that's great.
Lives in bozeman and he's great and we 

1605
01:12:05,761 --> 01:12:06,594
were talking.
We did a deal about ethics and a lot of 

1606
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:13,140
folks wrote in and they said,
I'd be interested to hear what you think

1607
01:12:13,141 --> 01:12:13,974
about this.
If if an animal is wounded and you're 

1608
01:12:18,391 --> 01:12:20,430
say you're up in a tree stand or you're 
hunting,

1609
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,840
you know,
spot and stalk,

1610
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,590
or you're in the case of randy hunting 
over a waterhole.

1611
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,230
If you're doing that in,
in you're a hunter,

1612
01:12:28,231 --> 01:12:29,064
you hold a tag.
You can choose which animal you'd like 

1613
01:12:30,301 --> 01:12:31,380
to kill,
right?

1614
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:34,900
You have a buck or a doe,
male or female tag.

1615
01:12:34,901 --> 01:12:37,620
What you can choose which one he wants 
to kill it.

1616
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,620
If an animal comes by you that has been 
wounded,

1617
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,380
clearly been wounded,
clearly struggling,

1618
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:46,980
you know,
in the case of a rainy newburgh,

1619
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:48,323
he was sitting on a waterhole and I 
believe he was in Arizona with a trophy 

1620
01:12:51,301 --> 01:12:52,134
tag,
which means there was a lot of big meal 

1621
01:12:54,331 --> 01:12:55,164
too.
You're walking around and a lot of big 

1622
01:12:55,411 --> 01:12:57,360
antelope walking around there in that 
situation.

1623
01:12:57,361 --> 01:12:58,160
Pronghorn.

1624
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:58,993
Let's explain to people that are 
listening that don't know what we're 

1625
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:03,000
talking about.
When he says a trophy tag.

1626
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:06,960
What he means is there's some units that
are designated as trophy areas.

1627
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:08,910
It doesn't meAn you don't eat them.
the animal.

1628
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:13,920
What it does mean is that it's very 
difficult to get into this area.

1629
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:16,020
Yes.
To have a certain amount of points which

1630
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:19,440
means you are putting in to the pool of 
money.

1631
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:23,490
That is a for conservation for habitat 
protection.

1632
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:24,623
All you're puttIng in every year to try 
to get a tag and you could only get a 

1633
01:13:28,591 --> 01:13:31,920
tag and a lot of these places once in a 
lifetime for some places,

1634
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,670
10 years on tags that are once every 15 
years.

1635
01:13:35,671 --> 01:13:37,080
I mean it's very complicated point 
system,

1636
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:37,914
but yeah.
What,

1637
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,300
what's.
explain why they do that,

1638
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:44,330
they do that to preserve the population 
of big mature animals so that this.

1639
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,400
You can't just let anybody go in.
Like there's some places that are called

1640
01:13:47,401 --> 01:13:48,234
over the counter,
over the counter unit is is they know 

1641
01:13:51,271 --> 01:13:52,104
that there's a large healthy population 
of animals and they either the wildlife 

1642
01:13:56,431 --> 01:13:57,264
biologists in the state representative,
they choose to just let anybody go in 

1643
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:04,260
and when they think the animals are 
diminishing too much,

1644
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,213
then they'll put a cap on it.
But for now it's an over the counter 

1645
01:14:06,751 --> 01:14:07,590
unit.
Yes.

1646
01:14:07,591 --> 01:14:10,620
And then they have places that are very 
difficult to draw units.

1647
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,040
Yeah.
And those difficult to

1648
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,873
draw units is one of the places where 
randy newburgh was because he was 

1649
01:14:15,611 --> 01:14:19,810
looking for a big old mature animal that
it spreads genetic and it's tough.

1650
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,870
Like the term turf has been so 
weaponized.

1651
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:22,873
It's tough.
It's my fault for using like when you 

1652
01:14:24,521 --> 01:14:25,354
use.
I use it not in the term that most 

1653
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,180
peopLe think of it.
I think of trophies,

1654
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:30,010
a lot of different things.
I'm a mature animal.

1655
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,320
That's again,
once in a lifetime.

1656
01:14:32,321 --> 01:14:34,870
It takes many,
many years to draw.

1657
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:36,190
I think you should just call it a 
limited,

1658
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,710
limited jarl unit draw.
You know,

1659
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:39,603
hard to get every once in a lifetime 
hunt where you're never going to hunt 

1660
01:14:41,431 --> 01:14:44,320
there again and you're looking for the 
most unique animal that you can find,

1661
01:14:44,321 --> 01:14:46,060
the most mature animal that you can 
find,

1662
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:47,290
but along the way,

1663
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:48,730
yeah,
but along the way,

1664
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:49,960
like in this case,
ethically,

1665
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:50,794
he runs into a limping,
antelope pronghorn it comes into a 

1666
01:14:53,621 --> 01:14:56,440
waterhole on is limping to the point 
where he thinks,

1667
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:57,710
oh,
I'm,

1668
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:58,930
and this happens to a lot of hunters.
He's like,

1669
01:14:58,931 --> 01:15:01,180
oh,
I have this tag.

1670
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:04,060
I've waited a long time to get it.
It's a very unique tag,

1671
01:15:04,061 --> 01:15:04,894
of course,
is the way you explained it and would I 

1672
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:12,070
know I can eat this animal just the same
as I would any other one,

1673
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:17,940
but to to to exercise some mercy around 
this antelope that's clearly suffering,

1674
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,133
clearly injured.
Who knows how iT got injured to limping 

1675
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:24,220
up to a water hole.
He's.

1676
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:28,300
He's having this ethical.
I'm pondering in his head like,

1677
01:15:28,301 --> 01:15:31,000
should I dispatch this thing and it's 
suffering.

1678
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:35,230
Fill my tag this way because with a,
with a tag and that tag,

1679
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:38,650
you can then choose to do anything you 
want with it in legal bounds.

1680
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:39,653
You wish you didn't wound this animal so
you could let that animal pass and 

1681
01:15:42,031 --> 01:15:42,864
choose a a larger,
more mature and more impressive than 

1682
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,620
them and you get to let nature take its 
course,

1683
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:49,980
whether a predation or not in the case 
of this one,

1684
01:15:49,981 --> 01:15:52,950
but winter kill or something may take 
that animal or you can

1685
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:55,710
and it's a quote unquote suffering.
You doN't know.

1686
01:15:55,711 --> 01:15:58,350
We can't talk tO the animal and ask it 
his opinion,

1687
01:15:58,530 --> 01:16:02,100
but you can end what looks like it's 
suffering and fill your tag in that way.

1688
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:03,123
That's not the way normal hans play out,
but a lot of hunters are put in that 

1689
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:06,770
situation.

1690
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,270
Cool situation.
It's pretty rare,

1691
01:16:08,271 --> 01:16:09,360
but it can happen.
It can happen.

1692
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:11,630
It never happened to me,
but what we did is your answer,

1693
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:13,850
so the answer,
his answer was to shoot.

1694
01:16:13,851 --> 01:16:15,430
That was a shoot,
that analog.

1695
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,850
I agree with that.
You know why?

1696
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:18,980
Because also here's another possibility.
No,

1697
01:16:18,981 --> 01:16:20,270
antelopes come by.
Yeah,

1698
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:23,570
so if no nos come by,
just by fate,

1699
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:27,590
you don't get an animal,
so you spend seven days out there in the

1700
01:16:27,591 --> 01:16:29,750
wilderness and you come home empty 
handed,

1701
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:30,584
you don't get to eat an antelope or 
you're presented with this opportunity 

1702
01:16:34,581 --> 01:16:35,414
to be merciful,
to take this animal out that's injured 

1703
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,293
and you get to keep an antelope and 
although it's not the antelope that you 

1704
01:16:40,491 --> 01:16:41,324
dreamed of,
it's something that would still healthy 

1705
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:44,900
meal.
You get to feel good.

1706
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:45,734
The fact that you really did,
you put an animal out of its misery and 

1707
01:16:49,341 --> 01:16:52,130
and we all like mercy is a virtue.
Yeah,

1708
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:54,780
for sure.
We all would like to be like,

1709
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,280
and I,
and I said this in in randy kind of,

1710
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:58,720
we talked through it,
but I said that,

1711
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:01,510
that this is a unique situation to a 
hunter.

1712
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:05,920
If you're a hiker and you come across an
animal wounded in this way or injured in

1713
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:08,020
this way,
there's very little you can do.

1714
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:10,160
Yeah,
but this is unique

1715
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:15,160
to the hunter's responsibility to look 
at this animal and make this decision.

1716
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:18,680
Here's another argument.
another argument is you really should do

1717
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:19,514
nothing because those are the animals 
that are designated to be taken out by 

1718
01:17:22,101 --> 01:17:24,080
the predators and you want to keep the 
predator population.

1719
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:26,480
That was more my answer.
Randy's answer.

1720
01:17:26,481 --> 01:17:29,160
Like we,
we went back and forth course and um,

1721
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,130
I see both sides.
I see both sides too.

1722
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:32,023
And I think this,
that's one of those situations where as 

1723
01:17:33,891 --> 01:17:35,980
a hunter there was a,
you know,

1724
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:37,850
I'll go back,
there's another Podcast I did with a guy

1725
01:17:37,851 --> 01:17:40,490
named do sean's Montana and he,
uh,

1726
01:17:40,491 --> 01:17:40,781
his,
his,

1727
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:41,990
his real name,
his real name,

1728
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,910
he's fantastic.
John's Montana,

1729
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:44,771
who?
Shawn smith.

1730
01:17:44,771 --> 01:17:48,590
Dan is from checklists of akio.
He's an outdoor photographer and he's,

1731
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:52,340
he's a dope individual at a wonderful 
human that'd be with that name.

1732
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,780
He's,
he lives up to that.

1733
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:56,120
And tHe important thing we'd like sit by
his fire,

1734
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:57,830
like,
let me say the [inaudible] fire.

1735
01:17:57,831 --> 01:17:58,664
And because we were handmade boots,
of course he does show the fuck out of 

1736
01:18:01,491 --> 01:18:03,360
here.
What do you think he's aware?

1737
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:06,720
And he would make his own moccasins and 
most interesting man in the world.

1738
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,680
He's verY much this.
He likes.

1739
01:18:08,681 --> 01:18:09,514
So I did a podcast with him,
we sat by his fire and we drank plum 

1740
01:18:12,951 --> 01:18:15,410
brandy that he makes himself.
Of course it does.

1741
01:18:15,411 --> 01:18:16,820
Really.
He makes his own honey.

1742
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,870
He has icelandic sheep that he shares 
and he eats.

1743
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:20,713
He does a sada.
He kills a lamb everywhere and feeds 

1744
01:18:22,221 --> 01:18:23,054
everyone.
Assad.

1745
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:23,953
Wonderful human being.
He grew up in checklists of akio and 

1746
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,850
part of his describing his,
his growing up is like in,

1747
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:32,930
there's a term,
and I'll,

1748
01:18:32,931 --> 01:18:34,990
I'll butcher the pronunciation of it,
but mikayla,

1749
01:18:34,991 --> 01:18:35,824
vic is the term that he used to describe
a hunter as like hunter or the one who 

1750
01:18:40,251 --> 01:18:42,600
thinks and the way he described the 
culture,

1751
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:44,990
the cultural significance of 100 and 
his,

1752
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,223
you know,
um,

1753
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,940
when he was growing up in the late 
eighties and,

1754
01:18:47,941 --> 01:18:52,370
and checklist vacuum was that the hunter
had to be,

1755
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:54,500
was the,
was the judge and jury.

1756
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:55,993
So there was like a reverenCe around 
hunting or reverence around a hunter 

1757
01:18:58,431 --> 01:18:59,264
because hunter got the privilege in,
in his culture to be the judge and jury 

1758
01:19:04,551 --> 01:19:06,530
for what animal it gets taken out of the
herd.

1759
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:11,900
Like making that very serious decision 
to say,

1760
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:15,440
this animal is wounded,
this animal is too old,

1761
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,900
this animal is young enough.
Right?

1762
01:19:17,901 --> 01:19:18,734
You've talked about a lot on this 
podcast with some other smart hunters 

1763
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:27,280
that I think what hunting needs to 
become now that it isn't,

1764
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:32,060
is this exalted status in our society 
where we're at,

1765
01:19:32,061 --> 01:19:35,090
we're giving somebody with a hunting tag
or a hunting license.

1766
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:35,924
You're giving somebody the opportunity 
to make a decision about somethings 

1767
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:39,860
life.
Well,

1768
01:19:39,861 --> 01:19:40,694
you say exalted status.
THe problem is you don't have to earn 

1769
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:43,040
that status,
right?

1770
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:44,503
You could just go out and do it,
and one of the things that I've found 

1771
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:48,824
out about hunting that is a.
I don't know if it's necessarily 

1772
01:19:52,551 --> 01:19:53,660
surprising,
but it's.

1773
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:58,750
It's very difficult to express without 
personal experience,

1774
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:02,620
is that it?
The consequences are.

1775
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:06,020
it's so different than what you would 
think.

1776
01:20:06,021 --> 01:20:08,460
It's very difficult to do.
It's very physically

1777
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,293
exhausting.
The coNsequences of your actions are so 

1778
01:20:11,551 --> 01:20:12,384
grave in the rewards are so much 
different than any other way of 

1779
01:20:15,631 --> 01:20:17,610
acquiring food.
Even fIshing,

1780
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,290
which I love.
I love fishing.

1781
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:20,670
I love fish.
I like to eat them.

1782
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:21,960
They're delicious.
They are delicious.

1783
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:23,010
I'd catch them.
They're fun.

1784
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,620
I like catching fish.
It's not the same.

1785
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:30,540
There is something that we in and I 
don't think this is a learned thing.

1786
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:31,733
I think there is a.
There's a connection to difficult to 

1787
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:34,824
acquire mammals that goes deep in our 
dna and I think this is the reason whY 

1788
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:41,363
we.
I think one of the reasons why we enjoy 

1789
01:20:42,511 --> 01:20:43,344
fishing is because those reward systems 
were put in place by people that 

1790
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:48,054
survived by eating fish,
by all those generations of people that 

1791
01:20:51,181 --> 01:20:53,850
did catch fish and that was how they ate
that day.

1792
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:57,480
That excitement lives inside of you and 
you sparked that up.

1793
01:20:57,481 --> 01:20:58,750
When you get a big steel head on,

1794
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:04,130
he hear that real go because you're 
being informed,

1795
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:06,550
being informed by people that didn't 
have a choice man.

1796
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,530
Like these are people that had to have 
that fish to live.

1797
01:21:08,590 --> 01:21:11,260
Exactly.
So even though it's recreation to you,

1798
01:21:11,410 --> 01:21:12,243
it's a thrilling recreation,
but then the consequences aren't as 

1799
01:21:15,311 --> 01:21:16,144
grave.
There's something about a wounded deer 

1800
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:23,690
or wounded elk that is so horrific and 
immersive,

1801
01:21:23,691 --> 01:21:27,760
merciful killing that is so.
It's so such a relief.

1802
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:31,210
It's,
there's something powerful about it.

1803
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,340
Like I told you,
I shot that elk,

1804
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:38,890
that it's out there that walked four 
yards and I'm not exaggerating for yards

1805
01:21:38,891 --> 01:21:41,560
and fell over.
It was dead like that.

1806
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,113
And the guYs who were there,
they said it was quicker than any rifle 

1807
01:21:45,221 --> 01:21:47,830
shot they'd ever seen an elk die.
So they,

1808
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:52,630
they usually stand up longer from that.
That's what everybody wants.

1809
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:53,950
That horses,
it wants it.

1810
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:58,630
They want a course they do,
but if I catch a fish and uh,

1811
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,583
he's a,
I pull them out of the water and throw 

1812
01:22:01,121 --> 01:22:03,430
them on the ice and he's flopping around
for a few hours.

1813
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,010
I'm just happy I got him.
Yeah,

1814
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:06,093
it's different.

1815
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:06,581
Well,
they'd like,

1816
01:22:06,581 --> 01:22:09,770
you've had michael pollen on the show 
before he wrote that omnivore's dilemma.

1817
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:13,340
And in it he just said basically,
and I'm paraphrasing,

1818
01:22:13,341 --> 01:22:14,174
but he said it hunting is so different 
from the inside than it is from the 

1819
01:22:17,151 --> 01:22:18,200
outside.
Yes.

1820
01:22:18,201 --> 01:22:19,034
So easy to view hunting in the lens of 
like there's a dude sitting behind a 

1821
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,750
deer smiling and grabbing its antlers.

1822
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,200
There's also the problem that 
malnutrition.

1823
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,053
This country is almost nonexistent.
Fat people are poor people in this 

1824
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:32,670
country,
which is fucked.

1825
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:34,600
Like poor people are fat.
Yeah.

1826
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:37,140
Which is one of the weirder things about
our society.

1827
01:22:37,141 --> 01:22:37,974
This has never heard.
This has never happened in the history 

1828
01:22:40,321 --> 01:22:43,790
of human beings that the poor people 
with the big fat ones,

1829
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:44,850
they got Cell phones.
I mean,

1830
01:22:44,851 --> 01:22:46,140
there's a lot of rich people that are 
fat too.

1831
01:22:46,141 --> 01:22:46,974
Don't get me wrong,
but there's people who don't have a 

1832
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:51,180
problem being fat.
Sure.

1833
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:52,083
Right,
and this doesn't mean that does not a 

1834
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,570
lot of malnutrition there.
most certainly is,

1835
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:56,430
but it's nutrition.
It's not.

1836
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:57,623
There's not a lack of calories.
Lack of calories was a massive problem 

1837
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:04,530
throughout most of human history.
The lack lack of food,

1838
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:10,140
so it's the.
The access to food Is so normal to us.

1839
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,040
It's so easy,

1840
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:14,830
but the unfettered access to food is 
what's really normal now.

1841
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:18,760
That's what's changed with 
industrialization and coming on fast,

1842
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:20,650
fast food is processed,
food is fucked.

1843
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:21,330
Yeah.
He had.

1844
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:22,163
If you go back to when people,
when hunting was more normal in the 19 

1845
01:23:26,371 --> 01:23:29,430
twenties or the 19 thirties are really 
normal.

1846
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:31,710
There was also no fast food.
Yeah.

1847
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:32,603
So when you would get a roast,
even if you went into a butcher and you 

1848
01:23:35,311 --> 01:23:36,144
got a roast and you brought it home and 
you were making roast beef and you're 

1849
01:23:38,491 --> 01:23:41,670
cooking it,
or your uncle shot a deer,

1850
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:45,730
sat milk was delivered to your door.
Yeah.

1851
01:23:46,290 --> 01:23:47,700
not my dad,
you know.

1852
01:23:47,701 --> 01:23:49,590
So there's a lot of different.
It was wrong.

1853
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:50,810
It was wrong.
Yeah.

1854
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:51,840
So there's a lot of different.
Yeah,

1855
01:23:51,841 --> 01:23:53,430
like the removal from

1856
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:57,600
the actual process that hunters go 
through,

1857
01:23:57,601 --> 01:23:59,350
but actually it might not have been raw.
Right.

1858
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:01,770
When did they start pasteurizing and 
modernization?

1859
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:05,080
The jamie thing that was,
um,

1860
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:10,430
louis pester best.
That is who it was a realization,

1861
01:24:10,431 --> 01:24:11,160
right.
That's,

1862
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,740
that's what it came from.
Past Louis pasteurized milk.

1863
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:16,350
Um,
when did they start implementing that?

1864
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:19,560
Like when you would get the milk on your
door and those glass jars.

1865
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:21,060
Didn't that milk go bad quick though?

1866
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:21,831
But that's,
you know,

1867
01:24:21,831 --> 01:24:22,664
my grandparents,
that's what they would describe the 

1868
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:24,743
milkman.

1869
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:26,550
18 eighties.
So when it started,

1870
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:29,550
that's when it started.
I wonder when it was common.

1871
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,193
I wonder if

1872
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,730
when you think about like market 
hunting,

1873
01:24:32,731 --> 01:24:33,564
we always talk about an hunting,
like the turn of the century being this 

1874
01:24:35,761 --> 01:24:36,594
huge moment in hunting,
conservation market hunting really 

1875
01:24:40,261 --> 01:24:45,150
became a thing when when it accelerated,
when refrigeration became a reality,

1876
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,033
right and accelerated when railroads 
could take meat from the great american 

1877
01:24:49,231 --> 01:24:50,064
west back to the cities in the east 
coast and so those things like excel or 

1878
01:24:54,151 --> 01:24:54,984
that technology and those things,
accelerated market hunting and the 

1879
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:58,523
depredation of things like the white 
tail deer and and and the buffalo as we 

1880
01:25:01,921 --> 01:25:02,754
all same.

1881
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:04,263
I'm just trying to flavor this and the 
context of most people that hear these 

1882
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:10,360
conversations don't really know what 
we're talking about.

1883
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:11,920
Yeah,
so you.

1884
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:14,740
You're obviously well versed in this,
but for a lot of folks,

1885
01:25:14,741 --> 01:25:19,741
they don't understand that.
What haPpened was after the civil war in

1886
01:25:19,871 --> 01:25:22,150
particular,
there's a lot of soldiers,

1887
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:22,984
they weren't fighting anymore in the war
and they got jobs as hunters and they 

1888
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:30,380
would just go out with no rules and 
shoot as many animals as they wanted

1889
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:31,283
and we.
The term we call that as market hunting 

1890
01:25:32,821 --> 01:25:33,654
and their market hunting means that 
they're out hunting for marketing the 

1891
01:25:37,831 --> 01:25:38,664
meat or marketing,
the hides of marketing parts of the 

1892
01:25:40,081 --> 01:25:41,580
animal.
To them it's just the tongue.

1893
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:43,820
Which buffaloes for just the tongue.
Yep.

1894
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,040
So at that time,
and are at the turn of the century,

1895
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:47,470
right?
18,

1896
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:49,110
eighties,
turn of the century.

1897
01:25:49,111 --> 01:25:53,850
We had mass mass killings of people just
think of buffalo really?

1898
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:56,220
But white tail deer,
mallard duck,

1899
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:57,060
wild turkeys,

1900
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:58,020
elk,
elk,

1901
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:00,360
black bear,
black bear ever get that?

1902
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:02,760
Jesus christ.
Yes.

1903
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,040
This is a.
We're looking at

1904
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:04,873
a photograph of like so many fucking 
animals just hanging from these docks 

1905
01:26:08,601 --> 01:26:10,380
there.
And mostly it looks like all ducks.

1906
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:14,840
I don't see anything,
but there's nothing.

1907
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:15,793
What are those?
A whole.

1908
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,520
What are those easter eggs like bears.
Those are all ducks.

1909
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,640
Yeah.
Um,

1910
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:27,370
so there's the market hunting deer,
but they decimated massive quantities of

1911
01:26:29,151 --> 01:26:32,830
these wild game and they were like the 
hair.

1912
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,170
There's more whites healthier today.
Then when christopher columbus landed on

1913
01:26:36,171 --> 01:26:40,700
this continent at the time,
at the turn of the century,

1914
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:43,400
when at the height of the market on 
crisis in this country,

1915
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:46,610
there were,
there were enough,

1916
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,473
there were enough white tail deer that 
they probably would have been on the 

1917
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:54,971
endangered species list or been close 
and so the model of conservation that we

1918
01:26:55,161 --> 01:26:58,160
then enacted.
I don't want to say like,

1919
01:26:58,161 --> 01:27:00,320
I don't want to overexerts approval.
I've never heard of it,

1920
01:27:00,321 --> 01:27:02,390
but if you look at the,
if you look up jamie,

1921
01:27:02,391 --> 01:27:04,310
the north american model of wildlife 
conservation,

1922
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:10,190
there was,
there was a ton of key figures in taking

1923
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:11,053
what America had at that point,
which was basically the wild west where 

1924
01:27:13,911 --> 01:27:17,750
animals are dying at mass and with,
with railroads and refrigeration.

1925
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:18,583
Like we said,
tHey're then feeding and clothing at 

1926
01:27:20,961 --> 01:27:24,260
that time.
The masses in the urban settings,

1927
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:26,000
you know,
in New York and different places.

1928
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:30,170
But as,
as the centuries turned over.

1929
01:27:30,171 --> 01:27:31,004
And did you get into the teens and 
twenties guys like teddy roosevelt give 

1930
01:27:35,821 --> 01:27:38,270
her pinochet there.
You know john [inaudible].

1931
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:39,183
There was a bunch of figures who 
essentially kicked off what is american 

1932
01:27:44,121 --> 01:27:44,954
conservation movement,
the movement to conserve not only the 

1933
01:27:48,711 --> 01:27:49,544
wildlife populations,
but wildlands in wild waters and 

1934
01:27:52,241 --> 01:27:53,074
significant places in this country that 
we needed to protect because around the 

1935
01:27:56,511 --> 01:28:00,710
turn of the century we did not have that
feeling of value as a society.

1936
01:28:00,711 --> 01:28:01,544
There wasn't a like,
we have to go value that thing we've 

1937
01:28:03,021 --> 01:28:04,670
never seen because you could never see 
it.

1938
01:28:04,930 --> 01:28:07,670
Right?
And so we,

1939
01:28:07,671 --> 01:28:08,690
they were,
they went,

1940
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:13,430
they set about building a value 
structure for not only wildlife but wild

1941
01:28:13,431 --> 01:28:14,264
places.

1942
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,560
And they also said about a,
uh,

1943
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:22,030
a way that the user would pay for this 
conservation and this,

1944
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:23,624
these are the constructs of what we now 
know to be the north american model of 

1945
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:28,340
wildlife conservation,
which,

1946
01:28:28,690 --> 01:28:29,240
I mean,
this is,

1947
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:32,430
if you look at it today,
it's like one of the most successful and

1948
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:37,560
like the seminal systems of conservation
in the world in the world.

1949
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,473
It wasn't reallY codified until the 
eighties until guys like larry is dr 

1950
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:45,230
boulerice geist and shane mahoney and 
folks wrote it down and said,

1951
01:28:45,231 --> 01:28:46,610
this is what it is.
But pull it,

1952
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:47,523
if you could pull up the tenants of the 
north american model because I can list 

1953
01:28:51,141 --> 01:28:51,974
them off,
but north american model of wildlife 

1954
01:28:54,231 --> 01:28:57,380
conservation,
wildlife as public trust resources,

1955
01:28:57,530 --> 01:29:00,440
elimination of markets for game,
like that's what people say,

1956
01:29:00,441 --> 01:29:01,620
hey,
where can I buy some elk?

1957
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:02,100
You can

1958
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,160
can't.
You can buy from zealand.

1959
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:06,683
Wildlife.
Wildlife is a public trust that just 

1960
01:29:08,191 --> 01:29:12,390
basically means the states hold the 
wildlife and trust for the public.

1961
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:13,673
these animals belong to us.
STate holds them in trust and manage 

1962
01:29:16,891 --> 01:29:18,630
them in interest for us.
Now,

1963
01:29:18,631 --> 01:29:19,464
for people that have a problem,
that as an idea that we would own a 

1964
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:23,364
living thing.
The only reason for that is to protect 

1965
01:29:26,731 --> 01:29:30,090
those living things.
I understand on semantics that you would

1966
01:29:30,091 --> 01:29:33,240
have issue with either humans shouldn't 
in life,

1967
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:36,570
man,
we don't and maybe own is the wrong word

1968
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,420
to use.
Maybe owned is the wrong word to use,

1969
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:41,910
but it's like manage and cohabitate 
with.

1970
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:45,630
Maybe that's the better way to say this 
by being by looks.

1971
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:48,300
Whether we protect them or whether we 
decimate them.

1972
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,310
Right?
We are the stewards of the land,

1973
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:51,450
but we are.
We are the ones,

1974
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,620
the monkeYs with the guns.

1975
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:54,990
That's just if we have the ability to 
say,

1976
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:58,590
here's this number of animals,
here's this number of land,

1977
01:29:58,591 --> 01:30:00,510
here's,
here's how we encourage upon that land.

1978
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:03,120
Let's study that.
Make sure that's all good.

1979
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:04,183
Yes,
and then let's manage It as actively 

1980
01:30:05,911 --> 01:30:06,744
managed as hunters and anglers to make 
sure the carrying capacity of this land 

1981
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:13,650
meets the wildlife populations.
Everything is working in order to.

1982
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:16,560
It's the sustainable use of natural 
resource.

1983
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:18,450
That's what hunting is.
If anybody asks you like,

1984
01:30:18,451 --> 01:30:19,680
hey,
hey dude,

1985
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:20,543
what's hunting?
You say hunting in the north american 

1986
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:25,590
model is the sustainable use of natural 
resource.

1987
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,210
Yes.
To eat,

1988
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,520
to eat elimination,

1989
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,710
have markets for game.
We covered,

1990
01:30:30,711 --> 01:30:32,970
covered none of these animals that we're
talking about,

1991
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:36,750
whether you're eating black bear or 
whether eating deer,

1992
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,790
you cannot buy that stuff.
If you buy it,

1993
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:40,980
you're going to get raised.
Farm,

1994
01:30:40,981 --> 01:30:43,590
raised meat and most of it is from New 
Zealand.

1995
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:46,290
Yep.
Allocation of wildlife by law,

1996
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:47,760
right?
There's laws,

1997
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:48,863
right?
There is a law to say how many animals 

1998
01:30:51,061 --> 01:30:53,880
you can kill if you just like that fell 
in Missouri.

1999
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:54,714
That's gotta.
Watch bambi if you kill more than we're 

2000
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:57,990
supposed to kill your approach now 
you've broken the law

2001
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:58,873
and the law is dictated and most really 
good states like Montana by wildlife 

2002
01:31:03,861 --> 01:31:04,694
biologists,
conservationists and people that 

2003
01:31:06,831 --> 01:31:10,760
understand the population and what's a 
healthy population for the area.

2004
01:31:10,850 --> 01:31:14,540
Yep.
And how to maintain a correct balance.

2005
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,610
And there's a real science to that 
folks.

2006
01:31:16,970 --> 01:31:17,571
You know,
the,

2007
01:31:17,571 --> 01:31:20,760
the science of when you talked to 
wildlife biologists about this,

2008
01:31:20,790 --> 01:31:21,390
this,
I mean,

2009
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:24,410
we had a great podcast with doug during 
brian.

2010
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:25,840
Brian's last name.
Love doug.

2011
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:30,900
Darren was a fucking.
Can't remember my shitty brain.

2012
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:33,230
Um,
but we,

2013
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:36,650
we were talking about cwd,
chronic wasting disease,

2014
01:31:36,651 --> 01:31:40,460
the spread of it amongst wild animals.
And then just richard's Brian Richards.

2015
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:43,100
Shout out to Brian Richards and me pal,
doug,

2016
01:31:43,101 --> 01:31:44,640
darren.
But doug,

2017
01:31:44,830 --> 01:31:47,720
great dogs the best.
Keep fighting that fight over there.

2018
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,033
So what we talked about was the actual 
science behind this one particular 

2019
01:31:54,201 --> 01:31:56,540
issue,
but you grow to appreciate when you hear

2020
01:31:56,541 --> 01:31:57,374
someone like him talk the grow to 
appreciate the complex nature of 

2021
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:04,550
wildlife biology and maintaining the 
populations of animals,

2022
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:08,710
keeping keeping them healthy and making 
sure that these habitats are preserved.

2023
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:09,850
This is very complicated.

2024
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:10,920
Oh,
it's.

2025
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:11,753
It's impossible to really understand the
scope of these to take Wyoming or 

2026
01:32:16,811 --> 01:32:18,050
Montana.
We,

2027
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,920
we Tend to cordon off things we really 
care about like,

2028
01:32:20,921 --> 01:32:22,780
oh,
grizzly bears in the greater yellowstone

2029
01:32:22,781 --> 01:32:24,040
ecosystem.
We really care about that.

2030
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:24,874
That's the thing to talk about,
but really what we should talk about is 

2031
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:32,490
really what most wildlife managers are 
looking at is just like biodiversity and

2032
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:37,090
health of all wildlife populations and 
it predator prey,

2033
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:38,270
predator prey,
balance.

2034
01:32:38,271 --> 01:32:39,104
Like these are things that we've,
that we've set about in this model of 

2035
01:32:42,851 --> 01:32:46,080
conservation to say like we're not just 
by license,

2036
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:46,923
by license.
We are using science and biology to 

2037
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:53,000
dictate the way in which hunting is used
to benefit these populations back.

2038
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:55,923
OH,
it's gone,

2039
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:59,170
jamie.
Googling porn.

2040
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:02,980
A wildlife can only be killed for a 
legitimate purpose.

2041
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:05,140
That kind of says it all right.
It does,

2042
01:33:05,141 --> 01:33:05,974
but that.
What does that mean is where it gets 

2043
01:33:07,721 --> 01:33:09,030
weird when people like,
um,

2044
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:12,910
here's one goes to that.
People get really crazy.

2045
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:15,190
They'll get really crazy when you kill 
predators.

2046
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:17,623
Even if you can eat them.
Like I was looking at Adam Green trees 

2047
01:33:19,871 --> 01:33:22,510
page and braintree shot a cougar.
Did he send you that?

2048
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:24,063
He has not.
He's going to be here and we're gonna 

2049
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:26,620
cook it together.
Whoa.

2050
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,070
Going to cook some mountain lion

2051
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,440
I hear till it's delicious.
I've never had.

2052
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:32,960
You have.
I haven't had it like that.

2053
01:33:32,961 --> 01:33:34,410
I've shot.
But somebody else prepared.

2054
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:36,200
Would you say you hear tell,
but you have had.

2055
01:33:36,201 --> 01:33:38,530
I have had it and it is delicious.
Are you being coy?

2056
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:40,620
Being coy at all?
I hear.

2057
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:43,910
I like to sound folksy.
So people are saying what I'm saying,

2058
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:45,630
but no,
it's,

2059
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:46,630
it's,
it's,

2060
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:49,640
it's like lean and delicate and it gets 
like pork almost.

2061
01:33:49,641 --> 01:33:50,474
It's really good.

2062
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,770
And then people will go crazy.
Like why are you killing that?

2063
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:54,773
Do you understand how fucked it is that 
you have zero problem with someone 

2064
01:33:58,671 --> 01:34:01,580
killing a deer,
but you have a problem,

2065
01:34:01,581 --> 01:34:02,414
someone killing a mountain lion and this
is a real problem with someone killing 

2066
01:34:05,391 --> 01:34:10,160
something that will fucking kill you if 
it catches you alone in the forest.

2067
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:11,330
Yeah,
fucking for sure.

2068
01:34:11,331 --> 01:34:13,850
Kill your dog for sure.
Kill your kids.

2069
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:14,743
Definitely killed those cute little deer
and kill a shitload of them like one 

2070
01:34:18,651 --> 01:34:19,484
every couple of days for its entire life
and wherever they're experts at it and 

2071
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:27,450
for whatever reason we get it in our 
head that if,

2072
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:30,320
and I think this comes from this whole 
idea of trophy hunting,

2073
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:31,563
that if you kill something like that,
you're only killing that thing because 

2074
01:34:34,371 --> 01:34:36,440
you have a little dick and it doesn't 
work.

2075
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,473
You going to be a big man,
so you killed this thing that's better 

2076
01:34:39,831 --> 01:34:40,664
than you in this beautiful animal.
The definition of a surface level 

2077
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:45,560
examination.
It is,

2078
01:34:45,561 --> 01:34:49,640
but it isn't because this is the.
This is the narrative that's been pushed

2079
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:51,710
through all the channels.
They don't,

2080
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:55,820
unless they go out and research this 
stuff objective in depth.

2081
01:34:55,821 --> 01:34:57,900
And why would you they.
Let's be,

2082
01:34:58,390 --> 01:35:00,680
let's be devil's advocate.
Why would you,

2083
01:35:00,681 --> 01:35:02,900
if you're an accountant,
what do I want to look into?

2084
01:35:02,901 --> 01:35:05,180
The subtleties of predator hunting for 
us to keep that up,

2085
01:35:05,181 --> 01:35:06,000
please.
Why?

2086
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:06,860
Why do I want it?
Why?

2087
01:35:06,861 --> 01:35:07,694
Why do I give a fuck about that?
Like why don't we get some assholes 

2088
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:11,510
wants to shoot mountain lions,
but crazy.

2089
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:14,060
Always good to use dogs.
Oh wow.

2090
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:16,850
That's so unfair.
We talk for.

2091
01:35:17,070 --> 01:35:19,430
Can we talk for a minute about baiting 
bears?

2092
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:20,360
Yes.
With it's,

2093
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,790
can we,
we want to keep legitimate purpose.

2094
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:24,100
Let's keep legitimate purpose.
Right?

2095
01:35:24,270 --> 01:35:26,270
But I read if you want to keep that down
for the light,

2096
01:35:26,271 --> 01:35:28,780
is that what it is?
So just paid it back up when we need it.

2097
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:29,810
We'll get to it.
Um,

2098
01:35:30,210 --> 01:35:30,800
there's,
I,

2099
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,633
I read this,
I've read stories and you and I baited 

2100
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:35,630
it.
WenT hunting for bears baited before.

2101
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:40,790
And so I've heard a lot of in hunting,
they have the term fair chase,

2102
01:35:40,791 --> 01:35:45,791
which means a legitimate reason for the 
ability for the to escape.

2103
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,600
You're hunting the animal,
in all fairness,

2104
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:49,820
in the pursuit,
um,

2105
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:53,660
people beat,
beat up on bated bear hunting a lot,

2106
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:54,613
probably because bears are involved,
probably because it seems unfair to sit 

2107
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:03,560
in a chair and put out some donuts or 
put out some,

2108
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:04,713
uh,
dead beaver put out whatever attracts a 

2109
01:36:06,561 --> 01:36:10,810
bear to put a smell out into the forest.
The bear smells it,

2110
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:12,860
it comes to eat and you're there to kill
it.

2111
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:17,630
That seems like what lazy seems like.
That seems a lot of cheating.

2112
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:20,450
Cheating.
So people would say that's not fair.

2113
01:36:20,451 --> 01:36:21,860
Chase,
ethical.

2114
01:36:22,070 --> 01:36:22,790
Right?
And,

2115
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:26,150
and in some ways I agree with that in 
comparison to other ways of hunting,

2116
01:36:26,151 --> 01:36:27,830
right?
but at the same time I can say,

2117
01:36:27,831 --> 01:36:28,664
I can tell you this,
there's no more ethical if the idea is 

2118
01:36:31,491 --> 01:36:33,950
to kill the animal,
killed the right animal,

2119
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:35,300
especially in,
in bear hunting,

2120
01:36:35,301 --> 01:36:37,370
you're trying to kill a specific bore.

2121
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:41,960
A male bear that is pass holder past 
breeding.

2122
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:46,790
Anybody who's bear hunting will tell you
one of the hardest things to judge on,

2123
01:36:46,791 --> 01:36:50,840
it's on while it's living is a bear.
Whether it's a male or a female,

2124
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:52,670
how big it is,
how old it is.

2125
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:55,340
They are hard to judge because they're 
black.

2126
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:59,630
They they slide through the forest that 
I'll look that they don't stay.

2127
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:00,873
There's no markers.
Like if the bear is standing next to a 

2128
01:37:03,231 --> 01:37:04,560
volkswagen bug.
Yeah.

2129
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:05,330
You go,
oh,

2130
01:37:05,330 --> 01:37:07,160
okay.
I know how big a bug is.

2131
01:37:07,161 --> 01:37:08,270
That's right now.
How big the bears.

2132
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:10,480
That's right.
The bear is nexus and treat.

2133
01:37:10,481 --> 01:37:12,620
It's 100 yards away.
You really can't tell.

2134
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:14,210
It's hard.
So spotting and stalking.

2135
01:37:14,211 --> 01:37:16,940
Well we call spotting and stalking 
wishes like walking around,

2136
01:37:16,941 --> 01:37:19,010
trying to find a better.
Looking at it far away and getting close

2137
01:37:19,011 --> 01:37:19,640
enough to kill it.

2138
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:20,473
Whether it's with a rifle or bow.
There's a lot of problems with what 

2139
01:37:24,021 --> 01:37:27,740
seems to be a fair way to it to achieve 
the pursuit of that animal.

2140
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,130
There's a ton of problems around that 
because they're hard to judge.

2141
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:32,203
You could come up on a sow,
a female bear that has cubs in a bush 

2142
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:38,570
and he not see the cubs,
not know that it's a sow.

2143
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:40,490
You're far away with a rifle.
You crack,

2144
01:37:40,491 --> 01:37:42,530
you kill it.
To culture and out of the bush,

2145
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,140
that is not what you were trying to do.
You made a mistake there.

2146
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:49,730
In the scenario where you are at,
a bait site is animal comes in,

2147
01:37:49,731 --> 01:37:52,040
it's walking around very close to where 
you are.

2148
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:56,040
You get to judge it,
you get to look between its legs,

2149
01:37:56,310 --> 01:38:00,360
see if it has a dick or not,
and then just determined it's the animal

2150
01:38:00,361 --> 01:38:04,350
you want to dispatch and dispatch it 
ethically because it's closer to you.

2151
01:38:04,351 --> 01:38:06,330
It's 20 yards,
it's stabilized.

2152
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:07,643
A lot of times it doesn't know,
hopefully doesn't know you're there 

2153
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:13,080
rather than doing it from further away 
or having to stock close to it.

2154
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:16,590
So I say all this to say like this is 
complex.

2155
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:17,573
What you think might be fair chase,
what you think you might want to apply 

2156
01:38:20,701 --> 01:38:21,534
your own levels of fairness to doesn't 
always equal the reality of pursuing 

2157
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:29,430
that animal.
If the end game is to dispatch it fairly

2158
01:38:29,431 --> 01:38:30,270
and kill it fairly,

2159
01:38:30,850 --> 01:38:31,683
bears are a very unique animal in that 
there's so much more criticism because 

2160
01:38:36,101 --> 01:38:41,080
of teddy bears and yogi and fucking coca
cola commercials.

2161
01:38:41,260 --> 01:38:43,180
We have this idea of what a bear is.
Yes,

2162
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:44,223
and it's also the thing is,
and this is hard for people to accept 

2163
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:54,340
those old bores that were trying to kill
there.

2164
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:55,233
If you kill them,
it's better for the whole population of 

2165
01:38:57,071 --> 01:38:59,500
bears because they eat bears.
Now.

2166
01:38:59,501 --> 01:39:02,110
This is where it gets really fucked up.
And uh,

2167
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:06,290
you know,
my friend jonathan who is a,

2168
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:08,230
you met john and jen,
of course,

2169
01:39:08,231 --> 01:39:09,340
we were up there with them.
JonaThan,

2170
01:39:09,341 --> 01:39:10,174
their son,
saw one of the bears kill and start 

2171
01:39:13,631 --> 01:39:17,890
consuming a cub female,
scared the bear off.

2172
01:39:17,891 --> 01:39:19,270
And then eight,
her own kid.

2173
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:20,650
I've listened to

2174
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:21,280
podcasts.
I,

2175
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,230
a guy named cole kramer,
who I've hunted on kodiak island with.

2176
01:39:25,070 --> 01:39:29,390
He seen bear,
he seen male bears chase down,

2177
01:39:29,391 --> 01:39:30,224
sal's run them into a cave,
rip him and he's watched them rip cubs 

2178
01:39:33,771 --> 01:39:37,780
and rip them in half and eat them and 
spit them out like you know.

2179
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:40,340
And once you've seen That you're,
you're,

2180
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:41,853
you know,
no matter how many bear cartoons we 

2181
01:39:43,011 --> 01:39:43,844
show,
no matter how many times a bear has 

2182
01:39:44,941 --> 01:39:45,651
suspenders on,
in,

2183
01:39:45,651 --> 01:39:46,484
is talking to us.
It doesn't change no matter how many 

2184
01:39:48,081 --> 01:39:48,914
times we name a bear,
it doesn't change the bareness of the 

2185
01:39:52,311 --> 01:39:53,480
animal.
It doesn't change.

2186
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:54,383
It's prime,

2187
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,500
different animal.
It's a different kind of animal.

2188
01:39:56,650 --> 01:39:59,230
So there's nothing we can do to change.
bear being a bear.

2189
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:02,290
I don't think there's any evidence that 
they don't eat their own kids either.

2190
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:03,970
I don't think there is.
Right?

2191
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:05,450
I'm sure somebody,
you know,

2192
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:08,630
somebody way more educated me can tell 
you exactly what's happening there,

2193
01:40:08,631 --> 01:40:12,350
but we know you and I both know that 
they're killing those two.

2194
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:14,360
They're kiLling as many clubs as I can 
to get this out,

2195
01:40:14,361 --> 01:40:14,730
to come back

2196
01:40:14,730 --> 01:40:15,563
heat.
They're doing that and they're also 

2197
01:40:16,251 --> 01:40:17,780
doing it for food.
Food as well.

2198
01:40:17,810 --> 01:40:20,990
They eat them and they also try to bring
the saddleback and astro.

2199
01:40:20,991 --> 01:40:23,180
So your thing is,
you've talked about this before.

2200
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,760
Hunters are in a specific,
you know,

2201
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:26,663
are in a really interesting position to 
have seen to see these things and be 

2202
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:32,250
intimate with these animals,

2203
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:36,070
which is if you just explain what you 
explained to most people,

2204
01:40:36,071 --> 01:40:38,770
they would just snap head back like 
what?

2205
01:40:39,070 --> 01:40:41,890
They're cannibals,
100 percent of them are cannibals.

2206
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,540
Yeah.
Even the ones that were suspended.

2207
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:47,180
It is it.
It's this.

2208
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:50,590
I think what nonhunters want from 
hunters is,

2209
01:40:51,110 --> 01:40:52,820
is to one say,
listen,

2210
01:40:52,821 --> 01:40:54,820
this a complex thing that we're doing,
right.

2211
01:40:55,150 --> 01:40:57,310
We're going into a wild place and 
removing from.

2212
01:40:57,311 --> 01:40:59,770
It's something we didn't put there.
Fuck that serIous.

2213
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:02,290
But that's not.
We shouldn't be nonchalant about that.

2214
01:41:02,291 --> 01:41:06,430
we shouldn't celebrate it in ways that 
make it seem irreverent like that.

2215
01:41:06,490 --> 01:41:07,323
That we should.
We should understand it's serious and 

2216
01:41:10,361 --> 01:41:12,760
take that action.
Seriously.

2217
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:14,103
We should be,
you know again that guy do sean and he 

2218
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:19,870
was explaining and checklists of ikea to
go hunting.

2219
01:41:19,871 --> 01:41:20,704
You had to go take a class and learn 
flora and fauna and learn how many 

2220
01:41:23,681 --> 01:41:25,960
pheasant eggs were in a,
in a nest.

2221
01:41:25,961 --> 01:41:27,220
And in real.
Yeah.

2222
01:41:27,221 --> 01:41:31,510
And then once you became a hunter in the
terms that they describe it,

2223
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:32,973
then you had to like,
it was the amount of work you put into 

2224
01:41:34,691 --> 01:41:37,750
the forest that denote and what you 
could then hunt.

2225
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:38,833
You know,
so if you went to cut down this many 

2226
01:41:39,821 --> 01:41:42,880
trees,
you could go hunt a deer if you only did

2227
01:41:42,881 --> 01:41:44,580
one certain thing,
you could hunter rabbit,

2228
01:41:44,581 --> 01:41:46,300
like they had this.
Yeah,

2229
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,520
he describes it as this like interaction
with.

2230
01:41:48,610 --> 01:41:49,443
So that was the model that was her model
of conservation was very much like 

2231
01:41:52,391 --> 01:41:56,470
accountability and so I think what most 
nonhunters want from hunters because for

2232
01:41:56,471 --> 01:41:59,200
me,
I don't think about anti hunters as much

2233
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:01,480
as i think about somebody who just is 
smart,

2234
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:03,970
thoughtful,
he's never been.

2235
01:42:04,090 --> 01:42:04,923
You were this way at some point you're 
like person who really thought hard 

2236
01:42:08,681 --> 01:42:13,681
about what you were eating and wanted to
explore what is happening here.

2237
01:42:14,910 --> 01:42:19,450
Is there alternative ways?
So I think what non went from hunters is

2238
01:42:19,690 --> 01:42:21,340
for us to say,
listen,

2239
01:42:21,341 --> 01:42:22,174
we get it complex,
we get it's a serious thing and we're 

2240
01:42:24,941 --> 01:42:29,941
doing our best to unpack the moral and 
ethical entanglements in what we do.

2241
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:32,400
Yeah.
And it's,

2242
01:42:32,401 --> 01:42:33,790
it's not easy.
I mean,

2243
01:42:33,791 --> 01:42:38,791
we flush pheasants when we could shoot 
them on the ground and that's the way we

2244
01:42:39,431 --> 01:42:40,264
do what we call that fair chase,
but we don't like when an animal comes 

2245
01:42:44,411 --> 01:42:46,900
close enough to us and eats the corn 
that we can shoot it.

2246
01:42:46,901 --> 01:42:48,240
Like we don't like that either.
So these,

2247
01:42:48,241 --> 01:42:51,310
these things are entangled there.
It's hard to.

2248
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:52,750
It's,
it's a hard activity.

2249
01:42:52,751 --> 01:42:56,540
Two to reckon with.
Well the baiting part of it is,

2250
01:42:56,620 --> 01:43:00,610
is it's,
it's absolutely not as good.

2251
01:43:01,090 --> 01:43:01,923
Yes.
I'm not saying I'm out there bait and 

2252
01:43:03,011 --> 01:43:03,844
every animal,
but I'm saying I could just see as 

2253
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:07,143
somebody who likes the nuance of this 
and likes to explore this and likes to 

2254
01:43:09,671 --> 01:43:11,680
ask why.
Why,

2255
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:14,300
why is it that that's the case?
Why is it,

2256
01:43:14,301 --> 01:43:17,890
do we look down on people that,
that bait animals and board use dogs.

2257
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,110
Nobody use dogs to st.
Same reason.

2258
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:20,973
They do it for the exact same reasons.
So they get a close up ethical shot on 

2259
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,960
the difficult to pursue an animal.
Yeah.

2260
01:43:25,961 --> 01:43:26,794
And it's,
it always goes back to like the reasons 

2261
01:43:28,421 --> 01:43:29,620
we do what we do,
but.

2262
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:30,931
But again,
I,

2263
01:43:30,931 --> 01:43:32,380
I would hope that everybody listening to
this,

2264
01:43:32,381 --> 01:43:34,310
lots of people do that don't hunt.
They would,

2265
01:43:34,311 --> 01:43:35,410
uh,
they would ask themselves like,

2266
01:43:35,411 --> 01:43:37,420
what do I,
what do I expect from hunters?

2267
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:40,420
Like what is the thing that I expect you
to do to earn?

2268
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,130
because I,
I very much feel is 100.

2269
01:43:42,131 --> 01:43:44,450
I need to earn the respect of the non 
hundred.

2270
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:49,810
Like I have a,
I have a duty to my hunting community to

2271
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:52,610
actively earn the respect of every 900 I
run into.

2272
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:55,550
I feel like I got to do it and maybe 
I'm,

2273
01:43:55,551 --> 01:43:57,260
maybe I'm just making it harder for 
myself.

2274
01:43:57,890 --> 01:43:59,690
But I,
I feel like there's,

2275
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:02,990
it's an almost impossible task.
But I've done.

2276
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:05,660
you've probably done it.
I've done it on a one to one level.

2277
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:06,533
Yeah,
I definitely have flipped people 

2278
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:11,300
especially easy,
easier.

2279
01:44:11,550 --> 01:44:15,150
It's much easier when they eat meat.
We eat meat.

2280
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:16,290
It makes sense.
Yes.

2281
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:18,540
But then they'll still have a problem 
with the bear thing.

2282
01:44:18,541 --> 01:44:20,370
And the bear thing is when you got to 
sit them down with like,

2283
01:44:20,371 --> 01:44:23,100
I don't,
I don't prefer to hunt bears.

2284
01:44:23,190 --> 01:44:28,190
I don't in any way because I don't get 
weirded out about tricking gnosis.

2285
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:32,460
It's just the meat is not as good to me.
It's good.

2286
01:44:32,490 --> 01:44:33,323
It tastes great.
You have a nice roast or bear stir fry 

2287
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:37,050
or something.
It is delicious.

2288
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:40,090
So it's not like you spit it out,
but it's not also comparative to elac.

2289
01:44:40,091 --> 01:44:41,000
It's like man,
okay.

2290
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:42,740
Yeah.
You can't even have it medium rare,

2291
01:44:42,741 --> 01:44:44,240
which is the best way to eat meat.
That's right.

2292
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:45,163
So it's not the same to me,
but if I lived like an alberta where 

2293
01:44:49,521 --> 01:44:52,100
john and jen live,
I would realize that it's imperative you

2294
01:44:52,101 --> 01:44:56,300
have to do and if you do like detail and
if you do like to eat deer and if you do

2295
01:44:56,301 --> 01:44:59,210
like deep moose is really your 
responsibility to hunt bear.

2296
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:00,133
Yeah.
Because they kill 50 percent of all the 

2297
01:45:02,241 --> 01:45:05,960
moose calves,
the calves and the deer fauns 50 percent

2298
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:09,710
get killed by black bear.
Now here's the other thIng.

2299
01:45:09,711 --> 01:45:10,544
You could say,
well that's because nature has bounce 

2300
01:45:12,350 --> 01:45:13,183
and the reason why they're there.
So those fucking Deer don't look at 

2301
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:17,300
those kangaroo in that park.
And that's true too.

2302
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:18,523
That's true to the right and I think 
it's our job to not have any sort of 

2303
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:28,070
bias when it comes to our examination of
this information,

2304
01:45:28,071 --> 01:45:28,904
whether it's flattering or not.
We have to be able to look at this 

2305
01:45:30,861 --> 01:45:32,570
subjectively.
We ain't got to be pragmatic.

2306
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:33,440
Yes,
have to,

2307
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:36,440
and you have to be honest and I think 
this is.

2308
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:37,453
You'll have to address the complexity.
You have to realize that this is very 

2309
01:45:41,181 --> 01:45:42,590
complex,
but guess what?

2310
01:45:42,591 --> 01:45:44,120
Fuck face.
If you wear a leather shoes,

2311
01:45:44,121 --> 01:45:44,954
you got clothes,
you got a leather interior in your car 

2312
01:45:47,410 --> 01:45:49,550
eating cheeseburgers,
you should probably shut the fuck up.

2313
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:52,810
we're human consumption engines.
We breathe in and breathe out.

2314
01:45:52,811 --> 01:45:53,644
We consume the world around us.
That's the way it works as you always 

2315
01:45:55,301 --> 01:45:56,134
say life is life and that,
but the reality of the situation for me 

2316
01:45:59,411 --> 01:46:00,244
is like I've tried to not stray away 
from but try to add onto the pragmatic 

2317
01:46:04,991 --> 01:46:09,850
arguments for hunting to try to examine 
like the emotional issues we have around

2318
01:46:09,851 --> 01:46:13,030
caring for the single animal over caring
for the entire species of,

2319
01:46:13,110 --> 01:46:16,120
of that animal or in any case,
subspecies of that like that.

2320
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:18,310
That to me,
somethiNg I've tried to add on,

2321
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:20,440
like let's first start with praGmatic 
arguments.

2322
01:46:20,441 --> 01:46:22,870
Like you eat meat,
you're fucking killing things.

2323
01:46:22,871 --> 01:46:27,871
Like why aren't you thinking this hard?
As I'm thinking about this and in a.

2324
01:46:27,970 --> 01:46:31,510
I really would love to build a bridge 
with people to say I care.

2325
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:32,493
Like if you're in a.
Let's say you're an anti hunter and you 

2326
01:46:36,251 --> 01:46:37,400
love animal,
you're a vegan,

2327
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:41,080
you a lot of conversation about b and 
I'm a v,

2328
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:43,540
I really care about animals are sentient
beings.

2329
01:46:43,541 --> 01:46:44,374
They all deserve life.
Put that person in front of me and then 

2330
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:49,410
I'll stand right beside them and be 
like,

2331
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,070
I fucking

2332
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,960
agree with you.
I agree that all animals are sent to you

2333
01:46:52,961 --> 01:46:55,860
at beings.
I agree that they all deserve life and I

2334
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:58,440
and then I go to preserve that life for 
that animal.

2335
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,640
that's what I go to do.
We start me in that anti hunter.

2336
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:03,753
I'm a hunter.
Start at the same point and then over 

2337
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:11,421
the years board of sword that it's those
animals I do so that that eliminates you

2338
01:47:12,931 --> 01:47:16,510
from their side,
but that instantly,

2339
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:19,020
yes,
because your diet,

2340
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:20,723
but you're an animal consuming machine.
This person's the animal consumer 

2341
01:47:23,641 --> 01:47:24,690
machine.
TheY're just not admitting it.

2342
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:25,553
They just don't understand.
They just don't understand it mean 

2343
01:47:26,641 --> 01:47:28,590
machine because they don't organically 
garden.

2344
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:30,630
Yes.
If they organically gardened and neat,

2345
01:47:30,631 --> 01:47:31,464
everythIng that they grow themselves,
even then it's hard to detach yourself 

2346
01:47:33,931 --> 01:47:35,870
from your consumption of the world 
because it's hard.

2347
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:37,600
Like what's.
What's in your compost,

2348
01:47:37,601 --> 01:47:38,220
bro?

2349
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:39,520
Yeah.
it,

2350
01:47:39,521 --> 01:47:40,354
it makes it easier for you.
Let's just leave the vegan out of the 

2351
01:47:41,821 --> 01:47:43,620
conversation.
Say the non hunter is like,

2352
01:47:43,730 --> 01:47:45,630
I don't kill animals myself,
but I care about them.

2353
01:47:46,170 --> 01:47:48,150
I'm like,
I care about them and I kill him.

2354
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:49,043
Were at the same,
like if you removed the second part of 

2355
01:47:50,911 --> 01:47:52,380
the sentence,
the first part is I care about them,

2356
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,090
right?
We both care about animals.

2357
01:47:54,091 --> 01:47:56,280
We're standing at one point and over 
time,

2358
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:01,520
whether it's mass media or just the way 
hunting has been marketed in the poor pr

2359
01:48:02,101 --> 01:48:02,934
agent that we've had,
we've kind of walked away from each 

2360
01:48:04,681 --> 01:48:05,491
other,
right?

2361
01:48:05,491 --> 01:48:06,324
We started with,
we both care about animals that we've 

2362
01:48:07,471 --> 01:48:08,304
kind of walked away from each other and 
over time we've been unwilling to turn 

2363
01:48:12,211 --> 01:48:16,080
around and face each other and be like,
remember when we started out thinking we

2364
01:48:16,081 --> 01:48:18,480
all value these animals,
we value their lives,

2365
01:48:18,481 --> 01:48:19,440
we all care about them.

2366
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:23,370
Hunting is just a version,
our version and it's worked.

2367
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,380
given that model of conservation where 
you're talking about,

2368
01:48:25,410 --> 01:48:28,260
it's worked for the white tail deer in 
the mallard duck.

2369
01:48:28,261 --> 01:48:30,180
It's worked.
There's more than ever.

2370
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:34,380
Um,
I'm just doing it a different way than,

2371
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,233
than you've chosen to do it.
I'm doing it in a more proactive way 

2372
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,040
than you've chosen,
you know,

2373
01:48:41,041 --> 01:48:43,570
think about it.
And so I would,

2374
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:45,060
if,
if a vet came up to me and be like,

2375
01:48:45,061 --> 01:48:45,894
listen man,
there we have more similarities in my 

2376
01:48:48,001 --> 01:48:49,080
opinion,
than we do differences.

2377
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:53,310
We've just chosen the difference.
The one big fat thing that's different.

2378
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:55,950
It's the difference though.
It's the most important difference.

2379
01:48:55,951 --> 01:48:56,784
You want to kill animals need them.
They don't think you should be allowed 

2380
01:48:58,590 --> 01:48:59,760
to.
They don't think it's right.

2381
01:48:59,761 --> 01:49:02,700
They don't think it's moral.
They don't think it's an ethical.

2382
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:05,250
I just think everything is wrong with 
what you're doing.

2383
01:49:05,660 --> 01:49:08,850
But we both care about animals.
That is a fucked up way to look at.

2384
01:49:08,851 --> 01:49:12,430
I care about people too.
I just like to eat them being great.

2385
01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:13,530
I'm going to be president,
but I'm gonna.

2386
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:15,500
Eat five people a week.
I don't know.

2387
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:18,030
Imagine if you run for president and 
say,

2388
01:49:18,031 --> 01:49:19,560
I really love people,
but I like to eat them.

2389
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,090
It was a well there.
Those are people.

2390
01:49:21,091 --> 01:49:21,924
Don't eat them.
I don't want to be that simple to tell 

2391
01:49:24,241 --> 01:49:26,430
you about animals.
I would say.

2392
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:27,713
I'm telling you that by,
by taking the lives of these few 

2393
01:49:30,001 --> 01:49:32,820
animals,
I'm working on the full,

2394
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:35,550
the full breadth of tell you if you 
really cared,

2395
01:49:35,551 --> 01:49:36,384
you just donate the money.
You just Donate the money to 

2396
01:49:38,191 --> 01:49:41,010
conservation.
Fuck the pittman robertson act just,

2397
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,820
I'm still feed my family.
I'm still making myself a better person.

2398
01:49:44,821 --> 01:49:48,130
I'm still enriching my fucking life,
so don't tell me I don't have the right

2399
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:48,963
to do that because you think animals are
sent to you and you're still killing 

2400
01:49:50,651 --> 01:49:51,484
animals by driving on roads and eating 
corn and doing the things you're doing 

2401
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:56,680
right.
But they're not directly killing them by

2402
01:49:56,681 --> 01:49:58,430
their food choices.
Well,

2403
01:49:58,431 --> 01:50:03,220
they don't know they are so into like,
proxy killing is better than than actual

2404
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:05,800
killing.
Well consciously,

2405
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:06,641
right?
Okay.

2406
01:50:06,641 --> 01:50:07,474
Actual consciously killing or buying 
something that's actually consciously 

2407
01:50:10,421 --> 01:50:14,590
killed is different than if you buy.
If you buy soy,

2408
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:17,170
if you eat tofu,
there is a fact,

2409
01:50:17,171 --> 01:50:18,004
and that fact is,
there has to be a lot of animal 

2410
01:50:20,531 --> 01:50:23,860
displacement in order to make that 
amount of field available,

2411
01:50:23,861 --> 01:50:26,260
to grow soy or to,
to grow,

2412
01:50:26,261 --> 01:50:27,760
um,
soybeans.

2413
01:50:27,761 --> 01:50:31,510
Then it's just the fact.
And then when you talk to anybody that's

2414
01:50:31,511 --> 01:50:32,344
ever seen what happens when a crop gets 
hit by a combine and then the vultures 

2415
01:50:35,261 --> 01:50:36,094
start flying overhead,
there's a reason it's because there was 

2416
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:38,253
a bunch of little fucking squirrels and 
rabbits and all sorts of shit that just 

2417
01:50:41,351 --> 01:50:42,184
got ground up and anything else that 
gets stuck in that field as those 

2418
01:50:45,611 --> 01:50:47,580
gigantic machines come worrying by.

2419
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:48,413
And that's what.
That's how when you're talking about 

2420
01:50:50,201 --> 01:50:53,620
large scale agriculture,
that's how things are harvested.

2421
01:50:53,730 --> 01:50:55,600
Of course,
they're not plucked one by one.

2422
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:56,583
Now,
if you're one of those people that has 

2423
01:50:58,751 --> 01:51:01,330
an organic garden and you pluck one by 
one,

2424
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:02,173
you take your rotten apple cores and you
fucking orange peels and you throw it 

2425
01:51:05,381 --> 01:51:07,960
all in a compost pile with some dead 
leaves.

2426
01:51:07,961 --> 01:51:10,120
And,
and you use that as fertilizer,

2427
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:12,370
you're going to run out of nitrogen 
because you need fish.

2428
01:51:12,371 --> 01:51:13,204
Bitch.
Oh shit switched from devil's advocate 

2429
01:51:18,430 --> 01:51:19,360
folks.
Guess what?

2430
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:21,940
WheN you buy a fertilizer is dead fish 
this.

2431
01:51:21,941 --> 01:51:24,610
Look,
there is a fucking unusual cycle.

2432
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:25,473
It's really weird.
But that cycle is that dead animals 

2433
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:31,300
actually fueled the plants that you 
consume.

2434
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:34,330
So if you're a person that is,
you know,

2435
01:51:34,331 --> 01:51:36,720
if you're,
even if you're eating wild plants right,

2436
01:51:36,730 --> 01:51:37,563
you want to eat some wild plants,
guarantees I'm dead fucking squirrels 

2437
01:51:39,971 --> 01:51:43,150
and rats and pigeons and anything else 
went to fertilize,

2438
01:51:43,151 --> 01:51:43,984
fertilize.
You probably had that mean they've 

2439
01:51:45,731 --> 01:51:46,564
proven that there's salmon dna sometimes
In plants because those plants have 

2440
01:51:51,191 --> 01:51:54,670
actually used salmon for a fertilizer.
Like people have used that,

2441
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:58,060
those dead fish and that shit gets into 
the plants themselves.

2442
01:51:58,250 --> 01:51:58,901
Yeah,
it's all.

2443
01:51:58,901 --> 01:52:00,220
It's all very strange,
man.

2444
01:52:00,221 --> 01:52:02,110
There's no way out man.
There's no way out of this,

2445
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:04,960
but in their eyes even there was no way 
out.

2446
01:52:04,990 --> 01:52:05,823
It's the out.
It's the path of least pain and 

2447
01:52:08,471 --> 01:52:09,090
suffering and

2448
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:09,923
I would tell those folks,
I respect the shit out of that and I'm 

2449
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:13,853
trying to do.
I'm trying to take my own this into my 

2450
01:52:17,311 --> 01:52:18,144
own hands and actively go and do the 
thing that I know to be enriching to my 

2451
01:52:20,911 --> 01:52:23,040
life,
to make me a better person,

2452
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:24,173
to make me a more skilled person,
to give me more perspective on the 

2453
01:52:26,371 --> 01:52:27,870
world.
But at the end of the day,

2454
01:52:27,871 --> 01:52:28,704
the byproducts of all that activity is a
healthier ecosystem and more more 

2455
01:52:32,881 --> 01:52:35,820
wildlife because that's proven via the 
model we've said,

2456
01:52:35,821 --> 01:52:40,620
and I feed my family with that and I'm 
just trying to do what you're doing in a

2457
01:52:40,621 --> 01:52:41,454
more tangible way.
Your hands off I'm hands on is the way 

2458
01:52:44,701 --> 01:52:46,310
that I would say that and I respect

2459
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:48,880
the hands off.
I respect like that.

2460
01:52:49,310 --> 01:52:52,130
I'm cognizant of what's happening here 
and I'm trying to make it better.

2461
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:55,100
I respect that.
I feel what you're saying and I see what

2462
01:52:55,101 --> 01:52:55,934
you're trying to do,
but if I'm thinking through the eyes of 

2463
01:52:57,681 --> 01:52:59,090
a vegan,
you can go fuck yourself.

2464
01:53:01,130 --> 01:53:04,550
I'm being the nice guy near him.
A dick floods like vegans.

2465
01:53:04,551 --> 01:53:09,551
A lot of them are dicks because wiling 
net animals,

2466
01:53:10,011 --> 01:53:12,560
you kill the animals.
He fucking asshole.

2467
01:53:12,561 --> 01:53:17,561
You think you get a free to just kill 
animals and time you on or you don't.

2468
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:19,993
Some of them.
So I like this devil's advocate side of 

2469
01:53:21,501 --> 01:53:21,950
you,
joe.

2470
01:53:21,950 --> 01:53:22,783
Thank you.
Did you see my moby ever look at moby's 

2471
01:53:24,621 --> 01:53:27,020
page in every movie has a wonderful 
instagram page.

2472
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:28,353
Be something that was so preposterous 
the other day and I read the comments 

2473
01:53:31,641 --> 01:53:32,301
under it.
I was like,

2474
01:53:32,301 --> 01:53:36,410
this is so hilarious,
but eggs and this is what I mean.

2475
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:37,483
First of all,
folks of talking to a person who has 

2476
01:53:39,381 --> 01:53:40,214
chickens,
eggs are lIke the most karma free thing 

2477
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:45,410
says eggs cannot legally be labeled as 
healthy,

2478
01:53:45,411 --> 01:53:46,910
nutritiouS,
or safe to eat.

2479
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:48,373
First of all,
this is true because eggs are full of 

2480
01:53:50,721 --> 01:53:53,780
cholesterol and saturated fat and 
because every year over 100,000

2481
01:53:53,781 --> 01:53:55,800
people in the us contracts,
I'm going to salmonella from exit.

2482
01:53:55,801 --> 01:53:58,320
They cannot legally be advertised as 
healthy or safe or nutritious.

2483
01:53:59,060 --> 01:53:59,990
First of all,
there's central.

2484
01:54:00,210 --> 01:54:01,760
Okay?
I don't know why you post that.

2485
01:54:01,770 --> 01:54:02,603
Maybe you didn't look into it.
Is there something called animal 

2486
01:54:04,881 --> 01:54:09,200
equality?
How many people get salmonella from eggs

2487
01:54:09,201 --> 01:54:11,710
every year?
Because if it was 100,000

2488
01:54:11,711 --> 01:54:12,544
dollars to fuck,
that shouldn't be in the news would 

2489
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:18,230
collapsed so god damn fast.
So let's dismantle.

2490
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:20,210
Please,
please go ahead and do that.

2491
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:25,010
Does dismantle this preposterous idea 
that 100,000

2492
01:54:25,011 --> 01:54:26,660
people get salmonella.
Okay,

2493
01:54:26,661 --> 01:54:29,450
here we go.
Even with safety steps in place,

2494
01:54:29,451 --> 01:54:34,451
it is estimated that about one in 20,000
or one in 10,000

2495
01:54:34,821 --> 01:54:38,090
eggs are contaminated with salmonella.
Wow.

2496
01:54:38,450 --> 01:54:41,430
That's a lot,
right?

2497
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:43,470
What does he,
what did he say?

2498
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:44,820
100,000
people get it.

2499
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:48,660
Right,
but we'll see if you could find how many

2500
01:54:48,661 --> 01:54:51,030
people in the u s contract.
Salmonella.

2501
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:53,370
Okay.
Because if they find out

2502
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:55,093
that this salmonella and eggs,
are they finding out that's from 

2503
01:54:59,000 --> 01:54:59,833
uncooked eggs every year.
About a million people get salmonella 

2504
01:55:03,921 --> 01:55:07,190
infected from foods that had been 
contaminated by one of the many kinds of

2505
01:55:07,191 --> 01:55:09,280
salmonella.
Is he right.

2506
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:13,220
Okay.
Let's see if it's 100,000

2507
01:55:13,221 --> 01:55:14,054
people from egs.
How many people per year get salmonella 

2508
01:55:16,911 --> 01:55:17,744
from eggs?
Where does it say salmonella in the 

2509
01:55:21,851 --> 01:55:23,770
United States?
One hundred and 42,000

2510
01:55:23,771 --> 01:55:26,410
people in the United States are infected
each year with salmonella.

2511
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:29,040
Whoa.
Hold on.

2512
01:55:29,370 --> 01:55:31,890
That says from chicken eggs.
Wait a minute.

2513
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:35,130
One hundred and 42,000
people in the United States are infected

2514
01:55:35,131 --> 01:55:39,180
each year with salmonella from chicken 
eggs and about 30 die dude.

2515
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:44,210
Not only It's not going to be right,
but he's off by $2,000.

2516
01:55:44,610 --> 01:55:46,420
now you're going to be way more of a 
devil's advocate.

2517
01:55:46,421 --> 01:55:47,254
Then.
I'm gonna hit you hard with this out 

2518
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:49,200
there.
Let's go.

2519
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:51,810
What'd you do?
Have any egg or egg related?

2520
01:55:52,030 --> 01:55:57,030
What does it actually kind of salmonella
salmonellosis.

2521
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:00,030
That's it.
Guess what it is when you get it.

2522
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:02,910
So we found that this is true.
Not only is it true,

2523
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:07,940
it's from 2010,
maybe it's different in 2000 1800 42,000

2524
01:56:08,581 --> 01:56:13,581
people in United States are infected 
each year with salmonella and enter itis

2525
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:19,530
syndromes and darius and titus 
underwriters from chicken eggs and about

2526
01:56:19,531 --> 01:56:23,190
30 die something last 30 pussies in 
2010.

2527
01:56:23,191 --> 01:56:25,950
And analysis of death certificate.
Joking,

2528
01:56:27,470 --> 01:56:28,530
joking.
It's just a.

2529
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,633
The podcast we're in.
The comedy section of itunes identified 

2530
01:56:32,131 --> 01:56:32,964
1,316
salmonella related deaths from 1990 to 

2531
01:56:36,421 --> 01:56:38,390
2006.
Whoa,

2532
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:40,350
whoa.
Now thanks moby.

2533
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:41,243
But this is a problem.
These fucking dummies are eating them 

2534
01:56:42,481 --> 01:56:44,100
raw.
This is what I want you to google.

2535
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:47,880
How nutritious are eggs?
How about google this?

2536
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:49,433
Because a lot of ways of looking at 
situational fucking life have never 

2537
01:56:51,841 --> 01:56:53,060
gotten salmonella.
Pretty good.

2538
01:56:53,310 --> 01:56:54,300
You're doing fine,
by the way.

2539
01:56:54,301 --> 01:56:56,670
If you eat chicken raw,
you get salmonella to stupid.

2540
01:56:56,970 --> 01:56:58,680
You're not supposed to eat it raw.
I supposed to cook it.

2541
01:56:58,890 --> 01:57:01,530
Okay.
One egg has only 75 calories,

2542
01:57:01,531 --> 01:57:04,530
but seven grams of high quality protein,
five grams of fat,

2543
01:57:04,531 --> 01:57:08,250
and one point six grams of saturated fat
along with iron vitamins,

2544
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:11,250
minerals,
and character carotinoids.

2545
01:57:11,490 --> 01:57:12,323
The egg is a powerhouse of disease 
fighting nutrients like lutein and 

2546
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:18,270
zeaxanthin.
Okay,

2547
01:57:18,271 --> 01:57:19,500
mavi.
So shut the fuck up.

2548
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:22,110
They're super,
super nutritious for you.

2549
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:25,500
Just occasionally back off moby,
somebody gets salmonella.

2550
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:28,930
How about just cook your fucking fucking
a grow.

2551
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:32,310
But here's where it gets really dark.
Why don't you google this?

2552
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:36,060
How many people die every year from 
ecolab?

2553
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:37,470
From vegetables.
That's right.

2554
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:42,570
Because a shitload anti corn is actually
from farmed animals.

2555
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:45,180
It's actually from agricultural runoff 
from the.

2556
01:57:45,370 --> 01:57:46,203
Let's google.
How much methane comes from how much 

2557
01:57:49,411 --> 01:57:51,060
methane comes from vegans?
Broccoli?

2558
01:57:52,510 --> 01:57:53,343
It's dead like hell.
Let's go back to this like where do you 

2559
01:57:54,961 --> 01:57:56,200
play the vegan?

2560
01:57:59,170 --> 01:58:00,680
So right.
He's not right.

2561
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:02,750
He's,
he's more than 40,000

2562
01:58:03,050 --> 01:58:06,800
moby please.
Just six degrees of moby dick.

2563
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:08,183
Edit your post with the correct.
You're right about like eggs or 

2564
01:58:09,961 --> 01:58:11,210
dangerous pro.
Delete them wrong.

2565
01:58:11,211 --> 01:58:13,020
I could die and don't eat them raw 
stupid.

2566
01:58:13,590 --> 01:58:14,430
Okay.
Here it goes.

2567
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:19,480
Cdc estimates 260 265,000
infections occur each year in the United

2568
01:58:20,790 --> 01:58:23,070
States of eco lie.
Wow.

2569
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:27,540
Thirty six percent are caused by 
[inaudible] zero.

2570
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:30,060
One five or seven point eight slash 
seven.

2571
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:31,113
Dude,
it's almost all from animal agriculture 

2572
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:35,400
is almost all from uh,
from shit,

2573
01:58:35,910 --> 01:58:36,743
from shit water types of ecolab.
The rosalind can be transmitted through 

2574
01:58:40,231 --> 01:58:42,300
contaminated water or food to contract

2575
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:43,570
with the animals or people.
Yeah.

2576
01:58:43,571 --> 01:58:44,404
But when they say contaminated water,
what they really mean is that water's 

2577
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:49,330
contaminated with shit from animal 
agriculture.

2578
01:58:49,331 --> 01:58:54,331
I think almost entirely.
What is the source of eco lie?

2579
01:58:55,020 --> 01:59:00,020
The google this most prominent source of
eco lie from vegetables,

2580
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:04,030
I would guarantee you it's um,
animal agriculture.

2581
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:07,030
I mean if you see those gigantic factory
farms,

2582
01:59:07,031 --> 01:59:10,420
the runoff and most prominent source of 
ecole lion vegetables.

2583
01:59:10,421 --> 01:59:11,254
Is that what you said?
You're better at this than just 

2584
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:16,840
configure it.
Get it.

2585
01:59:16,841 --> 01:59:18,550
Joe,
do you find it?

2586
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:20,590
You find the evidence?
I'm trying to be.

2587
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:22,440
I'm trying to be a good moby.
Yeah.

2588
01:59:22,450 --> 01:59:23,283
I'm trying to be a vegan.
I'm not arguing for the vegans on 

2589
01:59:26,090 --> 01:59:27,460
vehicles like this.
I like this.

2590
01:59:27,490 --> 01:59:29,320
It's not hard to do.
It's hard to do.

2591
01:59:29,321 --> 01:59:30,970
It's it.
It's a respectable position,

2592
01:59:30,971 --> 01:59:32,080
man.
It just is.

2593
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:34,013
It's all three actually was probably one
of the thing that popped up as the most 

2594
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:39,960
common way to acquire e coli infection.

2595
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:40,853
It's unpasteuRized milk.
Fresh produce and fresh produce means 

2596
01:59:44,771 --> 01:59:46,920
not cooked,
so if you get broccoli,

2597
01:59:47,150 --> 01:59:47,961
you have like a.
Yeah,

2598
01:59:47,961 --> 01:59:49,600
just spin it.
You're supposed to cook spinach,

2599
01:59:49,630 --> 01:59:50,463
celery,
and that's the problem with romaine 

2600
01:59:51,671 --> 01:59:52,211
lettuce.
Right?

2601
01:59:52,211 --> 01:59:53,044
Because romaine is.
Nobody ever cooks at stupid fucking 

2602
01:59:55,361 --> 01:59:57,200
shit.
Fuck.

2603
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:59,170
At least the world had no romaine 
lettuce.

2604
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:00,960
Do you think you'd be okAy?
I think it'd be fun.

2605
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:02,440
Dad calls it the hard lettuce.
He's like,

2606
02:00:02,441 --> 02:00:04,400
I don't want that hard.
Let us give you the soft.

2607
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:06,460
Oh,
I don't like giving soft lettuce.

2608
02:00:06,490 --> 02:00:09,550
Iceberg is just a joke.
It's just room for meat.

2609
02:00:09,700 --> 02:00:13,450
I couLd be putting meat in my stomach 
instead of that shitty ass.

2610
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:14,650
Delicious.
Delicious.

2611
02:00:14,950 --> 02:00:15,900
The lettuce.
Yeah.

2612
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,510
Listen,
I would say to you joe rogan,

2613
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:21,490
vegan,
I would say you're very handsome,

2614
02:00:21,491 --> 02:00:22,960
man.
Like you've seen healthy.

2615
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:25,030
Healthy is.
Fuck you have an organic garden.

2616
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:26,130
Your backyard.
Uh,

2617
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:27,130
no,
no,

2618
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:28,660
no.
I got some shit.

2619
02:00:28,661 --> 02:00:30,730
I grow a little bit,
a little bit.

2620
02:00:30,770 --> 02:00:32,500
Not a lot.
Get a lot of the store,

2621
02:00:32,690 --> 02:00:37,690
be honest with you to meet and I don't 
buy meat from the store.

2622
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:39,220
Like I,
I get,

2623
02:00:39,221 --> 02:00:40,054
I get to opt out of factory farming 
because I have a lot of wild game stuff 

2624
02:00:42,551 --> 02:00:44,380
in my house.
I have definitely still bought meat from

2625
02:00:44,381 --> 02:00:45,214
the store.
I buy way less of it and I eat meat 

2626
02:00:47,981 --> 02:00:48,814
almost every day,
but I'll still go to a restaurant and 

2627
02:00:51,341 --> 02:00:52,510
order a steak.
Yeah.

2628
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:53,583
I feel like this is something that 
attributing people probably heard 

2629
02:00:54,941 --> 02:00:55,774
before,
but it's like the feeling of eating 

2630
02:00:56,561 --> 02:00:59,500
while gaming is just different.
It's way different.

2631
02:00:59,590 --> 02:01:01,720
It tastes different.
It's better for you.

2632
02:01:01,721 --> 02:01:04,090
It feels different.
It feels different for my body,

2633
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:06,100
you know?
I mean I have.

2634
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:09,100
I remember watching this thing about ted
nugent once.

2635
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:09,771
I was like,
how's that goIng?

2636
02:01:09,771 --> 02:01:11,460
I got so much fucking energy.
I mean,

2637
02:01:11,510 --> 02:01:14,020
he's like 65 years old at the time 
period of the.

2638
02:01:14,540 --> 02:01:16,810
Well,
he's eating deer every day,

2639
02:01:16,811 --> 02:01:17,920
all day,
all day.

2640
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:20,650
I mean,
is it love or hate that guy.

2641
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:24,580
There's a lot of power to his diet.
He's a good guy.

2642
02:01:24,581 --> 02:01:26,920
You get to know him.
He really is like,

2643
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:29,440
people are saying to me like,
you good job ted nugent,

2644
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:30,610
the podcasts.
I love him.

2645
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:33,970
How about that?
Does he say things that I agree with 100

2646
02:01:33,971 --> 02:01:34,840
percent of the time?
No.

2647
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:36,880
I love ever sat and talked to uncle ted,
which uh,

2648
02:01:36,881 --> 02:01:37,601
you know,
shit.

2649
02:01:37,601 --> 02:01:40,040
I worked at the nra for a while and like
I used to get assigned

2650
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:44,120
to the ted nugent that talk that he gave
at the nra annual meetings.

2651
02:01:44,121 --> 02:01:44,954
Like,
um,

2652
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:50,040
I was a writer for the nra and like work
for the digital websites and I would get

2653
02:01:51,591 --> 02:01:54,760
assigned to like the ted nugent seminar 
at the nra annual meetings.

2654
02:01:54,790 --> 02:01:55,623
I would go and sit in the back with ted 
and he brought his brother and he gets 

2655
02:01:59,841 --> 02:02:01,220
crazy.
He's not fake.

2656
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:02,083
He ain't faking that.
They didn't like something he just puts 

2657
02:02:03,621 --> 02:02:05,240
on for the cameras.
That's ted,

2658
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:10,010
but he is smart man like he is.
As you found out on that podcast,

2659
02:02:10,011 --> 02:02:14,420
which I thought was amazing,
like that dude Is sharp as they come.

2660
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:15,370
You don't want.
Also,

2661
02:02:15,370 --> 02:02:17,200
he's reasonable and open to new 
information.

2662
02:02:17,201 --> 02:02:19,900
You don't wanna think I turned them on 
to marijuana.

2663
02:02:19,901 --> 02:02:20,500
Yeah,
you did.

2664
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:21,790
Okay.
First of all,

2665
02:02:21,820 --> 02:02:24,220
he's using cbd on a regular basis.
In fact,

2666
02:02:24,221 --> 02:02:26,830
if you go to ted nugent official,
go to his fucking.

2667
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:28,390
His instagram.
He was actually,

2668
02:02:28,690 --> 02:02:29,523
he was advertising jumbo cbd that I 
hooked him up with some serious knee 

2669
02:02:34,991 --> 02:02:36,770
pains because he's had a,
you know,

2670
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:39,340
he was telling me about his days of rock
and roll,

2671
02:02:39,341 --> 02:02:41,980
jumping off of amplifiers and he 
destroyed his meniscus.

2672
02:02:41,981 --> 02:02:42,670
His knees are shot.

2673
02:02:42,670 --> 02:02:43,503
I ran into him like three years ago at a
concert and went backstage and we were 

2674
02:02:45,821 --> 02:02:46,654
chatting and he had a huge ice packs 
when each one of his knees and he had 

2675
02:02:51,190 --> 02:02:53,830
just had surgery on one.
I don't know what the surgery was for,

2676
02:02:53,831 --> 02:02:58,540
but it like he had clearly he was 
clearly in pain and like he just looked,

2677
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,530
you know,
rundown.

2678
02:02:59,860 --> 02:03:02,800
But then we went out in the crowd.
He came on stage and it looked like a 25

2679
02:03:02,801 --> 02:03:04,660
year old rocca he

2680
02:03:04,970 --> 02:03:07,030
fucking,
he's a hard working man.

2681
02:03:07,031 --> 02:03:07,910
Yeah.
I mean when,

2682
02:03:07,911 --> 02:03:09,760
when the time comeS and the lights are 
on,

2683
02:03:10,690 --> 02:03:12,670
that guy goes after it and people like 
to.

2684
02:03:12,730 --> 02:03:16,330
So your support with the racist things 
you said or there's like no unfortunate,

2685
02:03:16,780 --> 02:03:17,613
you know,
whatever the fuck he said that you 

2686
02:03:18,311 --> 02:03:22,930
didn't like that either he shouldn't 
have said or maybe you didn't understand

2687
02:03:22,931 --> 02:03:25,090
what he meant or maybe it's out of 
context.

2688
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:28,510
Anything that hurts anybody's feelings.
Unfortunate and donald support it.

2689
02:03:28,511 --> 02:03:30,130
But guess what?
We're all.

2690
02:03:30,310 --> 02:03:31,143
We all have unfortunate things about us.
That's just a fact of being a fucking 

2691
02:03:34,481 --> 02:03:36,430
human being.
And one of the parts.

2692
02:03:36,790 --> 02:03:37,623
One of the things that we're doing when 
we're screaming out and calling out 

2693
02:03:40,601 --> 02:03:44,470
someone and we want someone deep 
platformed and dismissed and never,

2694
02:03:44,471 --> 02:03:45,304
never to be heard from again.
We're worried we're part of us are 

2695
02:03:47,531 --> 02:03:49,240
worried that that's going to happen to 
us.

2696
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:50,133
We're worried that we would ever exhibit
that sort of reprehensible behavior or 

2697
02:03:53,981 --> 02:03:55,970
language and we,
we wanna,

2698
02:03:56,020 --> 02:03:59,650
we wanna put a stop to it in ourselves 
and other people.

2699
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:00,693
We want to eliminate it from our society
and culture and want to do it harshly 

2700
02:04:03,611 --> 02:04:06,160
and ruthlessly and were terrified that 
it's going to be done to us.

2701
02:04:06,190 --> 02:04:07,050
Yeah.
You know,

2702
02:04:07,060 --> 02:04:07,893
and there's a Lot of people that make 
some fucking really terrible mistakes 

2703
02:04:10,930 --> 02:04:15,130
and I think there's gotta be some sort 
of a path to redemption.

2704
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:15,870
I really,
uh,

2705
02:04:15,870 --> 02:04:16,703
really believed that

2706
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:18,850
because I meet,
you know,

2707
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:19,913
in hunting,
I'm certainly don't meet the caliber of 

2708
02:04:21,421 --> 02:04:22,254
folks that you have in this room,
but like I meet these people in 

2709
02:04:23,731 --> 02:04:27,960
huntington and I run around in circles 
and people are saying,

2710
02:04:27,961 --> 02:04:30,420
this person thinks this.
And have you seen that instagram posts?

2711
02:04:30,421 --> 02:04:32,820
I don't believe in that.
And like knocking people down,

2712
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:34,680
you know,
and um,

2713
02:04:35,370 --> 02:04:38,010
I just think that I know that person,
a good person,

2714
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:40,170
you know,
and maybe he's not,

2715
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:44,310
he or she is not depicting this and the 
way that you like it in this instance,

2716
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:46,950
but that's a good well meaning person.

2717
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:48,353
People are more than capable of mistakes
and we should be more than capable of 

2718
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:56,510
allowing them redemption and forgiveness

2719
02:04:56,630 --> 02:04:58,570
since we should want the same thing for 
us.

2720
02:04:58,571 --> 02:04:59,404
Should I be on this podcast right now 
and have said something in the last 

2721
02:05:01,810 --> 02:05:02,920
couple of hours that was,
was terrible.

2722
02:05:02,921 --> 02:05:03,754
And like I would hope the folks that 
know Me would know that like this is a 

2723
02:05:06,671 --> 02:05:09,220
mistake and as long as I own up to the 
mistake and say,

2724
02:05:09,221 --> 02:05:10,600
hey,
uh,

2725
02:05:10,630 --> 02:05:14,140
it was in the moment,
I apologize a little bit of right brain,

2726
02:05:14,170 --> 02:05:16,240
a little bit of brain,
but brain was going,

2727
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:18,670
I apologize for,
for,

2728
02:05:18,730 --> 02:05:20,770
for that thing.
And it's not.

2729
02:05:20,830 --> 02:05:21,663
That doesn't define me because that's a 
very scare and slippery slope to get 

2730
02:05:24,761 --> 02:05:26,820
down as like one moment in your life.
Can't define.

2731
02:05:26,821 --> 02:05:27,090
Yeah.

2732
02:05:27,090 --> 02:05:30,840
It's also something that's really,
it seems way more recent,

2733
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:32,610
this,
this idea that,

2734
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:33,573
you know,
you want someone to never be heard from 

2735
02:05:34,771 --> 02:05:35,604
again.
They fucked up and they should never be 

2736
02:05:37,381 --> 02:05:39,570
heard from again.
And also I think,

2737
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:40,433
and this is my own bias,
I think it's a product of a shitty way 

2738
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:45,053
of distributing information that has 
existed all of our lives until recently 

2739
02:05:48,510 --> 02:05:49,343
and I feel like the long form 
conversation is the only way to get to 

2740
02:05:52,861 --> 02:05:57,000
know somebody and when you sit.
When I saT down with ted after the three

2741
02:05:57,001 --> 02:05:58,530
hours talked to mike,
I like this guy.

2742
02:05:58,620 --> 02:05:59,260
I liked him.

2743
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:00,011
Well,
like you say,

2744
02:06:00,011 --> 02:06:03,100
I love when I get off of a good podcast 
when I,

2745
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:03,993
when I was like an episode of the 
hunting collective and I sit down with 

2746
02:06:05,951 --> 02:06:07,210
somebody and they're like,
oh my god,

2747
02:06:07,211 --> 02:06:08,740
this person is like,
what?

2748
02:06:08,741 --> 02:06:10,480
They just brought to my life in two 
hours.

2749
02:06:10,690 --> 02:06:12,920
I'm so fucking happy to have had that.
Yeah,

2750
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:13,833
it's like a high you get.
It's a legitimate high because you 

2751
02:06:15,641 --> 02:06:17,710
don't,
you say this all the time.

2752
02:06:17,711 --> 02:06:18,544
You don't get to sIt down in your life 
and take two hours or three hours with 

2753
02:06:21,191 --> 02:06:22,024
somebody in just talk and exchange ideas
and disagree and agree and no 

2754
02:06:25,091 --> 02:06:26,620
distractions,
no distractions,

2755
02:06:27,290 --> 02:06:29,280
and that like what that gives you and 
if,

2756
02:06:29,350 --> 02:06:32,440
if folks haven't done that,
like that gives you something every,

2757
02:06:32,441 --> 02:06:33,274
almost every time.

2758
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:35,440
That's the only way you get to know 
people.

2759
02:06:35,570 --> 02:06:37,300
It's really,
it's very.

2760
02:06:37,990 --> 02:06:39,550
I mean,
I don't mean just through podcasts.

2761
02:06:39,551 --> 02:06:42,040
I mean in your life,
meaning if you don't have a podcast,

2762
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:45,180
sit down with someone to talk to them 
for several hours and how,

2763
02:06:45,190 --> 02:06:47,170
how often do you do that with your wife?
No,

2764
02:06:47,171 --> 02:06:48,340
man.
It's fucking rare,

2765
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:49,193
you know?
I mean I have made a vested interest in 

2766
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:52,593
long form conversation,
not just on the podcast but In my life 

2767
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:58,240
really over the last like five or six 
years.

2768
02:06:58,280 --> 02:06:59,113
Yeah.
Who better than you did say that and be 

2769
02:07:00,021 --> 02:07:02,060
like,
this has informed the way that I think,

2770
02:07:02,061 --> 02:07:05,000
the way that it's impacted our society 
in our culture,

2771
02:07:05,001 --> 02:07:06,350
this show,
like it changed the

2772
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:10,810
way I feel about being change the way I 
feel about what communication is like.

2773
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:13,900
I ha,
I have convenient perceptions of people.

2774
02:07:13,901 --> 02:07:16,030
I think we all do our conveniently go,
oh,

2775
02:07:16,031 --> 02:07:17,950
that guy's cool,
all that guy's not,

2776
02:07:17,951 --> 02:07:20,020
or this girl's an asshole or whatever,
whatever.

2777
02:07:20,021 --> 02:07:20,854
My convenient perceptions of people.
I find that a lot of them are based on 

2778
02:07:25,151 --> 02:07:27,850
these brief,
brief interactions.

2779
02:07:28,030 --> 02:07:30,380
They're based on,
you know,

2780
02:07:30,670 --> 02:07:31,503
small amounts of information that's been
distributed over long periods of and 

2781
02:07:35,711 --> 02:07:36,544
maybe one at one time I caught someone 
when they were hammered and they were 

2782
02:07:38,741 --> 02:07:41,710
being an asshole or maybe I was hammered
and I just,

2783
02:07:41,711 --> 02:07:44,260
I was annoyed by them or who knows what 
it was,

2784
02:07:44,650 --> 02:07:48,730
but to really understand who a person 
is,

2785
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:52,780
you have to sit down with them I think 
and just talk to them and you have to do

2786
02:07:52,781 --> 02:07:53,614
it for a long time and it takes a long 
time and you also observe their actions 

2787
02:07:57,161 --> 02:07:59,980
and observe them when they're tested and
they're observed though,

2788
02:08:00,010 --> 02:08:01,000
under duress

2789
02:08:01,190 --> 02:08:02,023
and there's no way to get out.
LIke get out of a long form 

2790
02:08:03,651 --> 02:08:04,790
conversation.
You can't say like,

2791
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:05,840
hey,
I gotta go now.

2792
02:08:05,930 --> 02:08:06,910
Yeah,
I'm,

2793
02:08:07,250 --> 02:08:09,440
I'm out of my depth.
All the things I said about myself.

2794
02:08:09,441 --> 02:08:13,640
How great I was before this.
Now you're opening up this chasm where I

2795
02:08:13,641 --> 02:08:14,474
don't know the thing that I said I knew,
but I could for a 32nd one minute tv 

2796
02:08:17,961 --> 02:08:19,070
spot.
I could train,

2797
02:08:19,071 --> 02:08:19,904
I could,
I could read the lines and I could come 

2798
02:08:22,431 --> 02:08:24,350
off like I look like I know what I'm 
talking about.

2799
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:26,900
There's no way to escape this.
This freakIng thing.

2800
02:08:27,010 --> 02:08:27,843
I just thought about something like how 
fucked up would a show be if you had 

2801
02:08:32,531 --> 02:08:37,240
just a husband and wife alone in a room 
with no one reacting to them,

2802
02:08:37,570 --> 02:08:38,403
right?
Just them sitting down at a podcast and 

2803
02:08:41,870 --> 02:08:42,703
that podcast gets broadcast to the world
and the whole world gets to wash their 

2804
02:08:46,271 --> 02:08:49,180
fucked up dysfunctional relationship and
how it plays out.

2805
02:08:49,181 --> 02:08:50,380
All the weirdness.
You know,

2806
02:08:50,381 --> 02:08:51,214
the.
There's weirdness that you see around 

2807
02:08:52,751 --> 02:08:53,584
people and their wives are.
Sometimes you have a couple of 

2808
02:08:54,791 --> 02:08:55,624
cocktaIls.
The wife will say something really 

2809
02:08:56,591 --> 02:08:57,424
shitty and

2810
02:08:57,970 --> 02:08:58,803
it's like a cup that spills over.
Like you're just like keeping all of it 

2811
02:09:01,001 --> 02:09:03,190
in the cup and then every once in a 
while you can't keep it in,

2812
02:09:03,850 --> 02:09:04,270
keep it in.

2813
02:09:04,270 --> 02:09:06,680
And then there's this,
like the guy does something,

2814
02:09:06,681 --> 02:09:09,980
do she or the girl does something conti 
or whatever the fuck it is.

2815
02:09:09,981 --> 02:09:11,600
And then you're like,
whoa.

2816
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:12,493
It first starts to,
it starts to trickle out and this 

2817
02:09:13,941 --> 02:09:17,180
passive aggressive way.
And then eventually if you're there long

2818
02:09:17,181 --> 02:09:21,320
enough it just becomes aggressive.
There's no power on them long enough.

2819
02:09:21,870 --> 02:09:23,880
and that's one of the things about 
alcohol.

2820
02:09:24,330 --> 02:09:26,100
It's so beautiful how that aggression

2821
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:28,400
comes out of people.
Okay,

2822
02:09:28,401 --> 02:09:29,960
I got you.
Tell me if you liked this,

2823
02:09:29,961 --> 02:09:33,140
you tell them if you liked this idea.
I had this idea the other day.

2824
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:34,273
It basically what we're doing it now is 
that I would do a show about ethics 

2825
02:09:36,561 --> 02:09:38,540
around like hunting and the outdoors and
things,

2826
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:39,913
but it would just be called drunk ethics
where I would just be drinking with 

2827
02:09:42,321 --> 02:09:45,320
people and having intelligent 
conversations that will increasingly get

2828
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:46,753
more and more fucking weird,
horrible fucking weird and open because 

2829
02:09:48,681 --> 02:09:49,514
I'm getting drunk drinking.
I'm drinking right now through this 

2830
02:09:55,461 --> 02:09:58,220
whole thing other thAn other than the 
fact that I had to pee.

2831
02:09:58,250 --> 02:09:59,450
Like yeah,
it's been great.

2832
02:09:59,670 --> 02:10:00,870
Yeah.
I'm not a.

2833
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:01,913
I'm not anti drinking.
I think there's something to be gained 

2834
02:10:04,261 --> 02:10:08,360
from the release of inhibitions and now 
there's something that's.

2835
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:09,573
I mean,
there's a reason why it has such a 

2836
02:10:10,111 --> 02:10:11,760
strong place socially

2837
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:13,110
we'll plug for right brain.
I mean,

2838
02:10:13,111 --> 02:10:13,944
I'm releasing inhibitions,
but also increasing brain function at 

2839
02:10:17,371 --> 02:10:18,204
the same time.

2840
02:10:18,250 --> 02:10:20,050
Your brain is so confused.
Hashtag.

2841
02:10:20,051 --> 02:10:20,884
It's like,
what,

2842
02:10:20,990 --> 02:10:24,120
what,
what is their hashtag?

2843
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:24,993
Right?
Um,

2844
02:10:26,050 --> 02:10:28,930
I think there'll be a wicked podcast 
every week.

2845
02:10:28,931 --> 02:10:31,870
You get together.
A couple that's been fighting tend to go

2846
02:10:31,871 --> 02:10:34,010
over there.
I feel about

2847
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:34,843
things.
Maybe have a therapist in the room 

2848
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:38,630
thought that there was no therapist will
ruin everything.

2849
02:10:38,660 --> 02:10:40,850
That's true.
People fight should just break up.

2850
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:44,020
It's just duke it out until they can't 
take it anymore.

2851
02:10:44,050 --> 02:10:47,150
Then just,
just go With a way of ben affleck and j.

2852
02:10:47,150 --> 02:10:50,660
Lo just fall for a short period of time.
You were in love.

2853
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:53,120
Let it hit the rocks.
Move on folks.

2854
02:10:53,121 --> 02:10:54,600
Don't you want to have a new person in 
your life?

2855
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:57,560
Do you have any listening?
Do you have any like,

2856
02:10:57,561 --> 02:11:00,080
um,
marriage advice?

2857
02:11:00,240 --> 02:11:02,480
Like I've been married for coming uP on 
five years.

2858
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:06,260
I have a two year old.
My wife wants to have more children.

2859
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:08,803
I just bought a new house,
living in a brand new house in a new 

2860
02:11:11,151 --> 02:11:11,984
town.
You got a lot of things going on that 

2861
02:11:13,461 --> 02:11:16,320
are pressure points it living the 
American dream a little bit.

2862
02:11:16,650 --> 02:11:18,740
I'm very happy with my family.
They're wonderful people.

2863
02:11:18,741 --> 02:11:21,560
I love them,
but like I want to sustain this.

2864
02:11:21,561 --> 02:11:22,394
I have a great thing.
I'd like to put my arms around to keep 

2865
02:11:23,700 --> 02:11:26,000
grads is so great.
I don't want it to go away.

2866
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:27,940
Well,
just that attitude alone,

2867
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:30,020
your your awareness of how special it 
is.

2868
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:31,213
you know you are doing the thing that 
everybody thinks of when they think 

2869
02:11:34,671 --> 02:11:37,670
about like fulfillment in life.
You're raising a child,

2870
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:39,670
you're having children,
you're,

2871
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:43,280
you know you're engaged in this intense 
relationship with another human being.

2872
02:11:43,281 --> 02:11:46,010
We've created a person.
All those things.

2873
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:48,890
Those are giant man.
There was a giant also.

2874
02:11:48,891 --> 02:11:53,780
You're engaged In an activity that 50 
percent of the people fail and they fail

2875
02:11:53,781 --> 02:11:54,740
at.
It fucking goes down.

2876
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:56,713
He goes down hard and screaming and 
swearing and lawyers of all the levels 

2877
02:11:59,931 --> 02:12:02,210
of failure in life,
like there's nothing more.

2878
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:04,190
No faIlure,
more impactful than a divorce.

2879
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:07,670
I mean,
if I have so many friends that have been

2880
02:12:07,671 --> 02:12:11,060
fired from jobs and it's not fun,
it's not good,

2881
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:12,720
but they bounced back.
He bounce back.

2882
02:12:13,490 --> 02:12:17,960
I've seen guys lose who they are from 
divorce.

2883
02:12:17,990 --> 02:12:21,680
I've seen it happen.
I've talked about this too many times,

2884
02:12:21,681 --> 02:12:25,400
but it's a true story.
I have a friend who has been divorced to

2885
02:12:25,401 --> 02:12:30,260
a woman for 14 years.
he's been married to a new one for 12.

2886
02:12:30,590 --> 02:12:33,890
He has family.
He has children with this new woman.

2887
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:38,980
It's over with the old one.
He still pays every year and they had no

2888
02:12:39,860 --> 02:12:44,320
children because he fucked her so hard.
She got work.

2889
02:12:46,290 --> 02:12:50,510
It's because it's crazy because the laws
are insane.

2890
02:12:50,690 --> 02:12:53,840
The laws are insane.
They don't make any sense.

2891
02:12:54,380 --> 02:12:57,920
We're not talking about a woman who was 
like 80 years old and can't work anymore

2892
02:12:57,921 --> 02:12:58,280
either.

2893
02:12:58,280 --> 02:13:00,580
When we're talking about completely,
you know,

2894
02:13:00,950 --> 02:13:03,860
viable human being,
students,

2895
02:13:03,960 --> 02:13:07,340
bananas did his banana foR that to flip.
Like you said,

2896
02:13:07,341 --> 02:13:08,174
when,
when back to the I do thing like when 

2897
02:13:09,801 --> 02:13:11,570
you say I do,
there's never.

2898
02:13:11,571 --> 02:13:14,000
I did have a buddy who when he said I do
and they turned around,

2899
02:13:14,001 --> 02:13:15,500
She looked mad.
He looks scared.

2900
02:13:16,980 --> 02:13:19,940
Why was she mad?
I probably that she didn't say it right?

2901
02:13:19,941 --> 02:13:24,941
Yeah,
he did say that some people just don't.

2902
02:13:29,210 --> 02:13:30,043
They're not supposed to be together,
but they think they should be somebody 

2903
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:32,673
until they find somebody in the talk 
that someone into doing something 

2904
02:13:34,801 --> 02:13:35,634
fucking insane.
Like signing a legal contract that says 

2905
02:13:38,341 --> 02:13:40,860
you're going to be together forever and 
ever until death.

2906
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:41,813
But see like what my problem is a very 
lucky problem that I've got something 

2907
02:13:43,850 --> 02:13:47,550
that at least in the early years it 
seemed to be the right thing.

2908
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:50,010
Right.
I love you honey.

2909
02:13:50,011 --> 02:13:51,910
I love you honey.
Hope you ain't listen.

2910
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:55,620
She made it this far.
What are we two hours and what?

2911
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:57,390
Thirty minutes?
Yeah,

2912
02:13:57,391 --> 02:13:58,080
she,
she's,

2913
02:13:58,080 --> 02:13:58,913
she's,
she's got a two year old by herself at 

2914
02:14:00,181 --> 02:14:02,760
home shame.
She checked a long time ago,

2915
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:03,810
but I like,
you know,

2916
02:14:03,870 --> 02:14:05,610
my challenge right now is I think about 
life.

2917
02:14:05,611 --> 02:14:06,840
I'm like,
I got this wonderful,

2918
02:14:06,841 --> 02:14:10,020
beautiful thing and I'm just distresses 
that I'm going to fuck it up.

2919
02:14:10,890 --> 02:14:11,910
Well,
that is,

2920
02:14:11,911 --> 02:14:12,744
I'm always the stress and I think that's
one of the reasons why a lot of 

2921
02:14:15,061 --> 02:14:18,870
marriages fail is because of this 
intense pressure of the relationship.

2922
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:20,093
You know,
like there's a finality in and I 

2923
02:14:21,691 --> 02:14:23,430
understand the need for this banality,
right?

2924
02:14:23,431 --> 02:14:26,910
There's a need for this contract and 
that everything locked down.

2925
02:14:26,911 --> 02:14:29,310
If you're a woman,
you can't win.

2926
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:32,790
You raising children like you need help,
right?

2927
02:14:32,790 --> 02:14:35,790
You need a man to be there to help you 
raise it hopefully,

2928
02:14:36,060 --> 02:14:38,250
but you also need financial help.
It's difficult.

2929
02:14:38,251 --> 02:14:38,590
You know,
it's,

2930
02:14:38,590 --> 02:14:39,720
it's,
this is all.

2931
02:14:39,930 --> 02:14:44,930
It makes sense that a woman would want 
to lock things in there like that.

2932
02:14:45,121 --> 02:14:48,060
It makes sense.
It's also a weird cultural tradition,

2933
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:48,923
right?
It's this weird thing that we have this 

2934
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:52,430
law,
like we,

2935
02:14:52,431 --> 02:14:53,264
we,
we bring the law involved into 

2936
02:14:54,980 --> 02:14:57,990
relationships and it's,
it's very strange,

2937
02:14:57,991 --> 02:15:02,480
like legal contracts and some of them 
are fucking preposterous,

2938
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:03,383
right?
Like sometimes you see a guy who looks 

2939
02:15:05,011 --> 02:15:06,250
like rupert murdoch,
right?

2940
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:07,253
And he's got this banging wife and she's
like 30 years old and she's got big 

2941
02:15:10,771 --> 02:15:11,604
tits,
or how about harvey weinstein and his 

2942
02:15:12,931 --> 02:15:13,764
wife,
she's in it for the right reason and 

2943
02:15:14,491 --> 02:15:15,390
you're like,
hey son,

2944
02:15:15,770 --> 02:15:18,240
I see what happened here.
But he sees it too.

2945
02:15:18,241 --> 02:15:20,380
We can't be blind to.

2946
02:15:20,420 --> 02:15:22,140
It was his whole business.
When they say I do,

2947
02:15:22,141 --> 02:15:22,711
they're like,
well,

2948
02:15:22,711 --> 02:15:27,120
okay,
well this is disgusting troglodyte type,

2949
02:15:27,750 --> 02:15:28,583
you know,
just gelatinous looking job of the hut 

2950
02:15:31,651 --> 02:15:32,484
looking man and a beautiful hot young 
wife because the guy's got fucking 

2951
02:15:36,210 --> 02:15:38,430
kajillions.
That's a normal thing.

2952
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:41,850
Then they're both editors put up any 
pictures,

2953
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:46,650
but they're both going.
Those folks there,

2954
02:15:46,730 --> 02:15:48,540
we were both going into that knowing 
like,

2955
02:15:48,541 --> 02:15:50,890
hey look,
this isn't a traditional or parents.

2956
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:53,790
maybe he was really sweet with her and 
that's all she needs.

2957
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:58,230
She's just this rare soul that if you 
had $5 in his pocket,

2958
02:15:58,231 --> 02:16:02,260
she'd be super happy with them.
Could be fucking doubt it.

2959
02:16:02,340 --> 02:16:05,100
I would doubt it as well.
It is like a motherfucker.

2960
02:16:05,220 --> 02:16:07,200
Fuck it.
Fucking doubt it.

2961
02:16:07,670 --> 02:16:08,503
Yes.
It's a preposterous union in the first 

2962
02:16:10,201 --> 02:16:11,910
place.
It's listen,

2963
02:16:12,030 --> 02:16:16,470
there's some relationships that you 
could define as legal prostitution.

2964
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:17,813
They are absolutely legal prostitution.
A woman has made a determination that 

2965
02:16:21,031 --> 02:16:26,031
she will let this sloths fluid into her 
vagina on an intermittent basis.

2966
02:16:27,330 --> 02:16:28,163
If she could be bathed in diamonds and 
drive a ferrari and live in a mansion 

2967
02:16:31,481 --> 02:16:34,420
and this is a normal part of life.
Some people would say,

2968
02:16:34,421 --> 02:16:35,254
and I might even say like as long as 
they're consenting and they're both 

2969
02:16:36,701 --> 02:16:37,534
aware that's going on,
then that would be a good argument for 

2970
02:16:39,881 --> 02:16:41,130
prostitution as well though,
wouldn't.

2971
02:16:41,140 --> 02:16:42,950
It's a bit of a transaction I guess.
I don't know.

2972
02:16:42,960 --> 02:16:43,840
It's a transaction.
Yeah,

2973
02:16:43,841 --> 02:16:45,940
I guess.
I guess when you look at it,

2974
02:16:45,950 --> 02:16:47,290
it is right that way.
I've always said,

2975
02:16:47,291 --> 02:16:48,970
why is it okay to give some of them 
sosh?

2976
02:16:49,450 --> 02:16:51,250
He gives him a massage.
You can't.

2977
02:16:51,410 --> 02:16:55,630
You can't even jerk him off like it's 
not legal.

2978
02:16:56,150 --> 02:16:56,983
That's the government decides who can 
touch your penis and the massage 

2979
02:17:02,111 --> 02:17:03,040
therapist said,
hey,

2980
02:17:03,750 --> 02:17:04,583
I really enjoy giving you a massage.
Let's go somewhere afterwards of my own 

2981
02:17:07,181 --> 02:17:09,130
free will and will jerk you off.
It'd be like,

2982
02:17:09,131 --> 02:17:10,410
that'd be fine.
That's fine.

2983
02:17:10,411 --> 02:17:11,020
Yeah,
you're right,

2984
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:11,801
you just can't do it.
Right,

2985
02:17:11,801 --> 02:17:13,660
but then the confines of the massage 
parlor,

2986
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:14,733
it's a public health issue.
Imagine if load smelled like gunshots 

2987
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:19,473
and you.

2988
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:21,673
He go to a massage parlor.
It's like a shooting range like fuck is 

2989
02:17:24,501 --> 02:17:27,320
going on.
This place is a dirty massage place.

2990
02:17:27,440 --> 02:17:28,990
I'm out pew pew,
pew

2991
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:41,640
load smelling jesus.
The devil was coming up for a devil.

2992
02:17:42,340 --> 02:17:43,960
Purify that man.
Yeah,

2993
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:46,960
I mean there's a lot of laws that are 
ridiculous,

2994
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:48,153
but there's.
There seems to be someone who hears the 

2995
02:17:50,171 --> 02:17:54,190
marriage advice I'm looking for.
I got it.

2996
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:55,840
I maybe it was what we were talking 
about earlier.

2997
02:17:55,841 --> 02:17:58,870
Maybe it's long form conversations.
Having conversations with each other.

2998
02:17:58,900 --> 02:18:01,900
I have no longer respect like respecting
the fact that you can't get through some

2999
02:18:01,901 --> 02:18:03,440
of this stuff in a very short time.
I've,

3000
02:18:03,850 --> 02:18:04,683
I've always said like,
I appreciate a nice road trip for that 

3001
02:18:06,401 --> 02:18:08,300
reason.
Yeah.

3002
02:18:08,690 --> 02:18:10,300
Hanging out with each other for long 
periods of time.

3003
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:11,473
Like I'd much rather the stress of an 
airport with the kid and the midwife is 

3004
02:18:13,871 --> 02:18:15,580
not.
I'd much rather just drive it.

3005
02:18:16,030 --> 02:18:19,870
Take the time because you get this like 
connection if you can get the phones out

3006
02:18:19,871 --> 02:18:20,704
of the way for the passenger,
she just get this connection that you 

3007
02:18:22,511 --> 02:18:23,344
wouldn't get otherwise.

3008
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:24,393
Yeah.
Doing things together that are unique 

3009
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:27,130
that that helps,
you know,

3010
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:28,233
experiencing things together.
But also you also have to both have the 

3011
02:18:30,401 --> 02:18:31,234
mindset that you enjoy each other's 
company and you want to make it work 

3012
02:18:33,701 --> 02:18:34,570
good.
Yeah.

3013
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:36,670
Some people just don't man.
And this is,

3014
02:18:37,330 --> 02:18:38,980
we've all seen that happen,
right?

3015
02:18:38,981 --> 02:18:41,890
We've all seen relationships with the 
girls just like check please.

3016
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:43,380
And the guy's like,
bebe,

3017
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:45,520
I'm different but it's a 50 like you 
said,

3018
02:18:45,521 --> 02:18:46,354
it's a 50 50 thing.
So like you have been married for quite 

3019
02:18:48,971 --> 02:18:49,804
some time and we were talking about 
prior to when we were shooting our bows 

3020
02:18:52,181 --> 02:18:53,014
out there,
like you're like things you've done to 

3021
02:18:54,460 --> 02:18:56,260
make it work.
Like you,

3022
02:18:56,261 --> 02:18:57,094
like your wife and she likes you and it 
works and it's been working for a long 

3023
02:19:00,041 --> 02:19:04,060
time and like the percentages say 
that's,

3024
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:07,610
that's what'd you say?
50 slash 50 is it?

3025
02:19:07,690 --> 02:19:08,523
Chris rock had a great joke about it.
He said he was 50 percent of the people 

3026
02:19:11,021 --> 02:19:11,854
leave.
He goes,

3027
02:19:11,980 --> 02:19:15,370
he goes,
but how many cowards just stay?

3028
02:19:20,440 --> 02:19:22,630
It's like,
relationships don't always work,

3029
02:19:22,631 --> 02:19:23,464
but here's the thing.
You don't always know who the fuck you 

3030
02:19:25,841 --> 02:19:28,130
are.
I'm

3031
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:30,410
a different person than I was five years
ago.

3032
02:19:30,860 --> 02:19:34,610
I just am.
I hope I'm a better person.

3033
02:19:34,820 --> 02:19:36,560
I'm trying very hard to be a better 
person.

3034
02:19:36,830 --> 02:19:39,470
I certainly know more about myself.
I understand myself better.

3035
02:19:39,471 --> 02:19:42,590
This is a long,
slow process.

3036
02:19:42,591 --> 02:19:45,080
I think we are all a work in progress,
right?

3037
02:19:45,590 --> 02:19:46,423
And not everybody engages in this work.
So you could be a person who's on this 

3038
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:55,200
path of,
you know,

3039
02:19:55,550 --> 02:19:56,383
being present and trying to be kinder 
and trying to improve and then you have 

3040
02:20:00,291 --> 02:20:03,920
a spouse,
male or female had just shits on you.

3041
02:20:04,220 --> 02:20:05,053
And I've seen that too.
I've seen the two really brutal toxic 

3042
02:20:09,321 --> 02:20:10,154
relationships where they insult and say 
rude things around your friends to try 

3043
02:20:13,971 --> 02:20:14,900
to fuck with you.
And,

3044
02:20:15,170 --> 02:20:18,450
and people get into these relationships 
where they would.

3045
02:20:18,460 --> 02:20:19,960
They genuinely hate.

3046
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:21,940
Yeah.
But they're stuck together.

3047
02:20:21,970 --> 02:20:23,200
And what that does,
the children too,

3048
02:20:23,201 --> 02:20:26,880
because I told my dad,
I wrote my dad this letter recently.

3049
02:20:26,881 --> 02:20:27,714
It's getting real deep.
Our number three of the podcast we get 

3050
02:20:30,401 --> 02:20:32,920
real deep.
We're pro nuance.

3051
02:20:33,960 --> 02:20:36,190
I'm send it to my dad,
but he won't listen to this book.

3052
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:38,770
I wrote this letter that was like,
listen man.

3053
02:20:39,430 --> 02:20:43,660
Because I thought I had seen recently 
like his developing relationship with my

3054
02:20:43,661 --> 02:20:48,661
son and like shot it,
put this thought in my head that know my

3055
02:20:50,141 --> 02:20:51,160
relationship,
my dad,

3056
02:20:51,161 --> 02:20:52,120
the,
his caring for me.

3057
02:20:52,121 --> 02:20:55,210
The fact that he stayed with my mom.
Then they developed this place for me to

3058
02:20:55,240 --> 02:21:00,240
grow and nurture me and allow me to 
become a person and the environment.

3059
02:21:00,941 --> 02:21:03,670
Like there was a north star for me.
Then I left that environment.

3060
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:04,593
Like I always,
I never wondered what my path was going 

3061
02:21:07,511 --> 02:21:08,110
to be.

3062
02:21:08,110 --> 02:21:10,660
I always could look up and be like that 
bond that I developed,

3063
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:12,880
my family,
their love for me is like the thing that

3064
02:21:12,881 --> 02:21:14,350
I'm always,
you know,

3065
02:21:14,351 --> 02:21:16,240
I'm looking back too,
but also looking forward to.

3066
02:21:16,241 --> 02:21:20,470
Because that's what defines me and 
regardless of what I do,

3067
02:21:20,770 --> 02:21:23,080
I can always fall back on that.
That my dad loves me,

3068
02:21:23,081 --> 02:21:23,914
my mom loves me,
I love them and I grew up like with the 

3069
02:21:27,371 --> 02:21:30,040
strength of soul because I knew I don't 
have.

3070
02:21:30,070 --> 02:21:32,430
I have friends that came from the same 
place that I did.

3071
02:21:32,450 --> 02:21:35,770
Same town.
I didn't Maryland that odd on heroin.

3072
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:40,480
They live in the same little suburb 
suburbia community that I did.

3073
02:21:40,660 --> 02:21:43,300
They had parents that were the same age.
They went to the same high school.

3074
02:21:43,301 --> 02:21:46,570
They lived in the same environment.
They went down one way.

3075
02:21:46,571 --> 02:21:51,571
I went down another and I truly do feel 
that that me going down that way was the

3076
02:21:52,271 --> 02:21:53,104
way that my parents like built this 
structure around me that was always 

3077
02:21:55,940 --> 02:21:56,773
route,
that bond and that love and the things 

3078
02:21:57,881 --> 02:21:58,714
that that's very,
very fortunate and that's in that me 

3079
02:22:02,291 --> 02:22:07,291
being able to later on in life see how 
fortunate I was to have that drove me to

3080
02:22:08,411 --> 02:22:09,244
not fail and to not let like whatever 
other failures creep into my life 

3081
02:22:14,171 --> 02:22:14,891
around,
you know,

3082
02:22:14,891 --> 02:22:15,850
maybe I'll take drugs.

3083
02:22:15,850 --> 02:22:17,470
I had a lot,
lot of friend's place.

3084
02:22:17,471 --> 02:22:21,550
I grew up in Maryland.
There's a lot of people succumb to drugs

3085
02:22:21,551 --> 02:22:24,130
and alcohol and things like that.
A lot of friends die,

3086
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:25,770
you know,
baltimore's rough spot.

3087
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:27,180
Yeah man.
Um,

3088
02:22:27,450 --> 02:22:29,490
I come from a town called hagerstown,
Maryland.

3089
02:22:29,550 --> 02:22:31,050
I say like,
come from a town,

3090
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:32,933
but the western Maryland is kind of is a
corridor for interstate 70 and 

3091
02:22:35,811 --> 02:22:36,644
interstate 81 and there's a lot of drugs
there and there's a lot of my friends 

3092
02:22:39,691 --> 02:22:42,620
that are either in jail or no longer 
around that.

3093
02:22:42,690 --> 02:22:44,090
A lot of successful ones too.
But that,

3094
02:22:44,220 --> 02:22:46,560
that,
that happened to me and I was able to,

3095
02:22:46,760 --> 02:22:48,600
I was able to look at that moment and be
like,

3096
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:53,340
I came from the same place.
They did the same environment,

3097
02:22:53,370 --> 02:22:55,710
the same friends,
the same,

3098
02:22:56,460 --> 02:22:58,890
um,
the same activities.

3099
02:22:58,891 --> 02:23:00,870
We all hunted and played sports and we 
all,

3100
02:23:01,020 --> 02:23:02,430
you know,
we hung out together.

3101
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,220
I went one way.
They went another way.

3102
02:23:05,810 --> 02:23:09,840
Do you attribute that entirely or to 
your parents or is it possible that it's

3103
02:23:09,850 --> 02:23:13,490
like who you chose to hang out with as 
well and the activities you engaged in?

3104
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:14,593
Because unfortunately I know people that
were good parents that had kids that 

3105
02:23:20,091 --> 02:23:20,540
old.

3106
02:23:20,540 --> 02:23:21,321
Yeah.
And listen,

3107
02:23:21,321 --> 02:23:22,154
I can't look.
I'm not trying to generalize in any way 

3108
02:23:24,351 --> 02:23:25,220
about,
you know,

3109
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:28,100
any one situation.
My situation was that I could always,

3110
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:28,993
I felt like.
And I told my dad at some point in my 

3111
02:23:29,961 --> 02:23:31,740
life where I said,
um,

3112
02:23:32,240 --> 02:23:33,073
I went to him and I was like maybe 20 or
19 and I said I'm going to get all a's 

3113
02:23:35,961 --> 02:23:37,490
now.
I'm done fucking around.

3114
02:23:37,970 --> 02:23:41,810
Like because I was a c plus student,
I was the dumbest kid in the smart class

3115
02:23:41,990 --> 02:23:44,990
through high school.
And there was a,

3116
02:23:44,991 --> 02:23:45,824
there was a time in my life where I 
realized that like I had to pay back 

3117
02:23:47,541 --> 02:23:51,050
when my parents and my grandparents and 
my family had done for me because I knew

3118
02:23:51,051 --> 02:23:53,120
that they'd given me something that not 
everybody had.

3119
02:23:53,690 --> 02:23:54,950
And I kneW.
I was like,

3120
02:23:54,951 --> 02:23:55,784
I know that I have to pay this back and 
I got to stop messing around now and go 

3121
02:23:59,571 --> 02:24:00,470
and do something.

3122
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:01,593
That's interesting because they did a 
great job then because sometimes what 

3123
02:24:06,071 --> 02:24:11,071
happens when people were raised with a 
giant safety net of love.

3124
02:24:11,630 --> 02:24:13,330
Yeah,
they become unambitious.

3125
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:14,890
They become,

3126
02:24:15,190 --> 02:24:16,023
I think I was close to them as boys.
I was close to that a little bit like 

3127
02:24:17,981 --> 02:24:18,490
fall,
like I'm,

3128
02:24:18,490 --> 02:24:19,323
oh,
I'm going to community college and 

3129
02:24:19,811 --> 02:24:23,680
smoking a lot of weed and and try and 
have a good time.

3130
02:24:23,890 --> 02:24:24,450
Yeah.
No,

3131
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:25,283
but there was a time of my life.
There was a legitimate time in my life 

3132
02:24:27,161 --> 02:24:29,800
where I said my dad,
I don't remember it,

3133
02:24:29,801 --> 02:24:30,634
but my dad remembers it there.
I just came to him and like it's over 

3134
02:24:32,681 --> 02:24:35,280
now it's time for me to just buckle down
and get it.

3135
02:24:35,820 --> 02:24:36,653
Well,
the difference between a child that 

3136
02:24:38,191 --> 02:24:42,960
you're taken care of and then someone 
who has to be on their own is 10 years.

3137
02:24:43,620 --> 02:24:44,550
Right?
An eight year old.

3138
02:24:44,551 --> 02:24:46,560
No one expects an eight year old take 
care of themselves,

3139
02:24:46,590 --> 02:24:48,690
but an 18 year old time to get your shit
together.

3140
02:24:49,110 --> 02:24:51,300
That's fucking quick.
It's a hard concept.

3141
02:24:51,301 --> 02:24:52,890
Quick to argon concept.
It's,

3142
02:24:52,950 --> 02:24:53,783
it's,
it's unbelievably hard and unless you 

3143
02:24:55,951 --> 02:24:56,784
introduce that child to hard work and 
the rewards of hard work and you're in 

3144
02:24:59,371 --> 02:25:02,340
their life,
you're probably going to set them up for

3145
02:25:02,341 --> 02:25:03,174
some kind of failure.
I was extremely fortunate that I found 

3146
02:25:06,031 --> 02:25:11,031
martial arts follow is that my biggest 
struggle in my teenage years and I found

3147
02:25:11,191 --> 02:25:13,740
something that was insanely difficult,
but the highs,

3148
02:25:13,770 --> 02:25:18,540
the rewards were like nothing I'd ever 
experienced in my life,

3149
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:20,100
so I realized like,
okay,

3150
02:25:20,310 --> 02:25:21,143
to get really good at something,
you have to be able to put in the kind 

3151
02:25:23,651 --> 02:25:24,484
of energy that most people are not 
willing to do and that's what separates 

3152
02:25:26,681 --> 02:25:31,620
you from them to find a discipline,
put a massive amount of energy and focus

3153
02:25:31,621 --> 02:25:34,030
and that discipline and then be obsessed
with it.

3154
02:25:34,090 --> 02:25:34,923
Then the rewards come if you analyze it 
correctly and pursue it with everything 

3155
02:25:38,741 --> 02:25:39,574
that you have,
you're going to figure out how to get 

3156
02:25:40,841 --> 02:25:43,180
better as long as you don't get really 
fucked up along the way.

3157
02:25:43,290 --> 02:25:47,830
There was a real possibility of that.
So what I realized early on,

3158
02:25:48,060 --> 02:25:48,893
fairly lucky was that all these people 
that I saw around me that were engaging 

3159
02:25:52,421 --> 02:25:57,421
in all this really risky behavior,
really crazy violence and drugs and what

3160
02:25:57,521 --> 02:26:00,100
they were doing was looking for thrills.
Yeah,

3161
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:00,993
that's what they were doing.
but they were looking for thrills in an 

3162
02:26:04,060 --> 02:26:07,720
easily accessible way that didn't 
require discipline.

3163
02:26:07,900 --> 02:26:12,550
It didn't require years and years of 
training and focus and commitment.

3164
02:26:12,551 --> 02:26:15,880
It didn't require that what I was doing 
was something.

3165
02:26:15,890 --> 02:26:17,620
And I was just lucky that I found this 
thing.

3166
02:26:17,621 --> 02:26:20,050
I just didn't want to get bullied and 
picked on.

3167
02:26:20,051 --> 02:26:21,070
I was,
I was little.

3168
02:26:21,070 --> 02:26:23,590
I wasn't a big kid.
You exerting look some control over your

3169
02:26:23,591 --> 02:26:24,990
life.
That was just really.

3170
02:26:24,991 --> 02:26:26,020
I was.
I was like,

3171
02:26:26,021 --> 02:26:29,800
I can't fucking do this.
I'm tired of being scared of people.

3172
02:26:29,830 --> 02:26:32,920
Discard this dude.
Give me this fucking tough guy.

3173
02:26:32,921 --> 02:26:35,560
Look and I've got to go the other way 
because I'm scared.

3174
02:26:35,860 --> 02:26:38,590
I just didn't want to be that.
I didn't want to be that.

3175
02:26:38,970 --> 02:26:43,150
I'm so that carried on with me for my 
whole life,

3176
02:26:43,540 --> 02:26:44,373
but I've seen so many people that didn't
find a discipline and they just bounce 

3177
02:26:47,981 --> 02:26:51,300
around like a cork at sea forever.
Man,

3178
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:53,080
iT's one of the reasons why I push it so
much.

3179
02:26:53,081 --> 02:26:53,914
I was like,
whatever the fuck it is that you can do 

3180
02:26:55,810 --> 02:27:00,220
that you like to do that's competitive.
like one of the things about competition

3181
02:27:00,221 --> 02:27:02,410
is not just that you prove that I'm the 
fucking man.

3182
02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:03,910
Know what it is,
is hard.

3183
02:27:04,030 --> 02:27:04,863
It's fucking cup competition is one of 
the hardest things because if someone's 

3184
02:27:07,421 --> 02:27:08,580
trying to do it and you're trying to do 
it,

3185
02:27:08,581 --> 02:27:11,640
it's like how much do you want it?
How much more do you want them?

3186
02:27:11,650 --> 02:27:13,570
They want it.
And that's,

3187
02:27:13,660 --> 02:27:17,690
that becomes this crazy fucking battle 
internally as well as.

3188
02:27:18,010 --> 02:27:18,843
Yeah.
But you say like all the time say 

3189
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:21,220
pressure creates diamonds.
Right?

3190
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:23,460
And in my case,
um,

3191
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:26,050
I,
I realized that I didn't,

3192
02:27:26,380 --> 02:27:29,950
I realized somewhere in my life that I 
have the opportunity to.

3193
02:27:30,310 --> 02:27:32,020
There's not enough pressure.
Right.

3194
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:33,940
I have this like soft,
like you said,

3195
02:27:33,941 --> 02:27:35,770
soft thing to fall back on,
which is like,

3196
02:27:36,190 --> 02:27:37,023
you know,
middle class family that they'll 

3197
02:27:37,871 --> 02:27:42,320
probably let me live there in their 
basement for songs that relate.

3198
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:44,033
Yeah,
but it's like I had the opportunity to 

3199
02:27:45,041 --> 02:27:48,460
do that,
but I think I just realized that part of

3200
02:27:48,461 --> 02:27:49,294
the reason I wanted to push forward and 
do it and find something that I was 

3201
02:27:51,881 --> 02:27:54,460
passionate about it because I knew that 
I had a choice.

3202
02:27:54,820 --> 02:27:58,870
I had a choice That I could do.
I could try to do something different or

3203
02:27:58,871 --> 02:27:59,704
I could fall back on what had been given
and I felt that what I'd been given was 

3204
02:28:03,521 --> 02:28:05,890
significant enough to my life that I 
owed it.

3205
02:28:06,370 --> 02:28:07,240
Know,
did something.

3206
02:28:07,330 --> 02:28:11,170
I owed it to drive toward whatever 
happiness I could find.

3207
02:28:12,230 --> 02:28:13,063
And it was,
it was that the stability of my family 

3208
02:28:16,451 --> 02:28:18,400
life and it wasn't perfect,
but it was,

3209
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:22,040
it was pretty good.
And rather than sink into

3210
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:22,551
that,
I was like,

3211
02:28:22,551 --> 02:28:23,390
I'm gonna.
Just push,

3212
02:28:23,540 --> 02:28:26,420
push through that and use that as fuel,
as intelligence.

3213
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:28,070
You know what I mean?
You have an awareness,

3214
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:28,711
you,
you,

3215
02:28:28,711 --> 02:28:32,030
you figured out what you can do and 
what,

3216
02:28:32,090 --> 02:28:32,923
what,
where this can go wrong and you 

3217
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:36,770
recognized it and you decided to make 
some changes,

3218
02:28:37,030 --> 02:28:37,863
not eat.
And I'm sure I like it'll have ups and 

3219
02:28:39,491 --> 02:28:40,324
downs,
but hunting is a thing that enriched my 

3220
02:28:41,951 --> 02:28:42,761
life,
truly did.

3221
02:28:42,761 --> 02:28:43,594
And then as much as it is problematic in
the way that it's presented in society 

3222
02:28:46,691 --> 02:28:48,220
in the way that,
that,

3223
02:28:48,221 --> 02:28:49,054
um,
people see it when they look at it 

3224
02:28:51,611 --> 02:28:54,760
through like a shallow lens.
Um,

3225
02:28:55,720 --> 02:28:56,553
I can say truly that it's enriched my 
life in ways I'll never be able to like 

3226
02:29:00,730 --> 02:29:02,710
truly,
like I met you through it.

3227
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:05,400
Like I met a lot of people I met,
I've,

3228
02:29:05,560 --> 02:29:09,410
and then I've met a lot of good people 
through that.

3229
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:10,593
Again,
the problem is looking at it from the 

3230
02:29:11,741 --> 02:29:14,440
outside versus experiencing the people 
that you're meeting.

3231
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:15,333
These are people that are doing 
something that's insanely difficult and 

3232
02:29:17,771 --> 02:29:19,720
it doesn't seem like it is for a lot of 
folks.

3233
02:29:19,930 --> 02:29:21,050
You look on the outside,
like what do you,

3234
02:29:21,130 --> 02:29:23,650
what's so difficult to shoot in an 
innocent animal?

3235
02:29:24,300 --> 02:29:27,130
Bowhunting,
which is what you and I mostly do,

3236
02:29:27,190 --> 02:29:30,430
is one of the most difficult things I've
ever done in my life and I've done a lot

3237
02:29:30,431 --> 02:29:32,470
of difficult shit.
It's fucking difficult.

3238
02:29:32,471 --> 02:29:36,010
It's incredibly difficult and people 
that you meet are not just disciplined,

3239
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:38,780
but they're in great shape.
You have to be like.

3240
02:29:38,790 --> 02:29:39,623
There's a physical exertion aspect to it
that's completely ignored and 

3241
02:29:42,221 --> 02:29:44,380
misunderstood or people are ignorant of 
it.

3242
02:29:44,410 --> 02:29:47,710
Not that it's ignored and they just 
don't understand it.

3243
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:52,600
It's Almost like an athletic pursuit 
that sustains life.

3244
02:29:53,050 --> 02:29:53,980
It's very,
very.

3245
02:29:54,010 --> 02:29:54,843
There's a reason why campaigns is out 
there running marathons and ultra 

3246
02:29:56,831 --> 02:29:58,390
marathon running right now.
He's.

3247
02:29:58,630 --> 02:29:59,463
He's not just doing thAt because he 
enjoys fitness and he most certainly 

3248
02:30:01,691 --> 02:30:02,524
does.
He's doing that because it helps him as 

3249
02:30:03,881 --> 02:30:06,580
a hunter and that took a lot of people.
They're like,

3250
02:30:06,581 --> 02:30:07,960
wait,
what are you talking about?

3251
02:30:07,961 --> 02:30:10,060
Like that doesn't make any sense.
I've seen hunting.

3252
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:10,631
Yeah.
I mean,

3253
02:30:10,631 --> 02:30:12,250
if you listen to this podcast and you 
never hunted,

3254
02:30:12,251 --> 02:30:17,251
like I wouldn't encourage you to go and 
find these people on the internet,

3255
02:30:17,471 --> 02:30:18,304
on the social medias and things and 
understand that each one of them 

3256
02:30:21,011 --> 02:30:22,120
represents,
in my opinion,

3257
02:30:22,121 --> 02:30:23,680
a layer of hunting,
right?

3258
02:30:23,740 --> 02:30:26,950
John dudley represents to me.
I mean he's a wonderful human being,

3259
02:30:26,951 --> 02:30:30,250
but like at its core on social media,
he represents the expert archer.

3260
02:30:30,430 --> 02:30:31,263
Yes.
That's a layer of hunting that you need 

3261
02:30:32,441 --> 02:30:33,274
to have if you're gonna be successful.
Campaigns represents the physically fit 

3262
02:30:37,270 --> 02:30:40,480
hunter and that's a layer that you need 
to have if you're going to be ultimately

3263
02:30:40,481 --> 02:30:44,830
successful like remy warren represent 
like the ultimate predator.

3264
02:30:44,831 --> 02:30:45,664
Being able to think about like an animal
does and move like an animal does and 

3265
02:30:48,850 --> 02:30:51,520
that's a layer that you have to have if 
you're going to be ultimately successful

3266
02:30:51,521 --> 02:30:53,920
and steven rinella represents the,
the great thinker,

3267
02:30:53,921 --> 02:30:54,754
the great theorist and all these are 
layers that you have to have at some 

3268
02:31:00,251 --> 02:31:01,540
level.
To be a good hunter,

3269
02:31:01,870 --> 02:31:05,110
to be the best hunter,
to be successful consistently,

3270
02:31:05,500 --> 02:31:06,333
you have to know so much and one of the 
things when I got into it that was 

3271
02:31:09,310 --> 02:31:11,530
interesting that steve said to me,
he said,

3272
02:31:11,890 --> 02:31:14,980
you're going to really like this because
it has so many layers to it.

3273
02:31:15,770 --> 02:31:16,603
It's like there's.
There's a lot of room to learn and grow 

3274
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:22,020
and you've never can master it.
No,

3275
02:31:22,530 --> 02:31:24,450
you can't.
You get especially bow hunting.

3276
02:31:24,900 --> 02:31:25,733
What are the possibilities?
You're gonna run into the same scenario 

3277
02:31:28,561 --> 02:31:30,320
over and over and over and over again.
Never.

3278
02:31:30,350 --> 02:31:32,430
I mean you get lucky a couple of years 
in a row,

3279
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:33,593
but eventually you're gonna run into 
some sort of a situation where the wind 

3280
02:31:36,871 --> 02:31:41,370
catches you or something goes wrong.
He stepped on a tree branch and snaps

3281
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:42,533
and it's one.
It's like it teaches you accountability 

3282
02:31:44,591 --> 02:31:47,560
too because when you release an arrow 
you are.

3283
02:31:47,561 --> 02:31:48,394
You can say whatever you want,
and I've had all these situations where 

3284
02:31:50,501 --> 02:31:53,220
I've arrowed landed in place.
I didn't mean it to,

3285
02:31:54,370 --> 02:31:55,203
and it teaches is accountability.
It teaches you ultimate accountability 

3286
02:31:58,830 --> 02:32:00,580
because when you release that arrow,
there's not,

3287
02:32:00,581 --> 02:32:03,870
you can't go get it back and if it hits 
the animal and a place in wounds and the

3288
02:32:03,871 --> 02:32:04,704
animal suffers,
it is on you and there is no way to get 

3289
02:32:08,051 --> 02:32:08,884
out of it.
There's no way to get out of that 

3290
02:32:09,431 --> 02:32:10,570
feeling and I've,
I've had,

3291
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:12,730
I don't know about you,
but I've had like months,

3292
02:32:12,760 --> 02:32:15,580
months,
like six months of just like,

3293
02:32:16,300 --> 02:32:18,250
I don't want to overstate,
it's not hyperbolic,

3294
02:32:18,251 --> 02:32:21,140
but like just really a lot of pain 
around like I did and I.

3295
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:23,560
It was my fault.
I got lazy,

3296
02:32:24,330 --> 02:32:26,920
I was presumptive,
I got too confident.

3297
02:32:27,430 --> 02:32:29,290
I just screwed up in the moment.
I don't know what happened,

3298
02:32:29,291 --> 02:32:34,291
but I've sent a very sharp object into 
the rump of a big elk and it ran off and

3299
02:32:35,410 --> 02:32:36,400
never to be seen again.

3300
02:32:36,570 --> 02:32:39,060
Well,
the consequences of thAt one motion,

3301
02:32:39,150 --> 02:32:39,983
the one movement that's going to release
that arrow are so significant that it 

3302
02:32:43,441 --> 02:32:46,320
fucks with your head.
That's where what we were talking about,

3303
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:47,550
you know,
we've talked about this many times,

3304
02:32:47,551 --> 02:32:49,200
but target panic.
That's what that is.

3305
02:32:49,530 --> 02:32:50,363
That's the realization of the 
anticipation of the moment and the 

3306
02:32:53,161 --> 02:32:53,994
consequences,
the understanding of the potential 

3307
02:32:55,711 --> 02:32:56,544
negative consequences,
and they're overwhelming and they haunt 

3308
02:32:58,441 --> 02:33:00,750
you.
They don't fuck this up in the.

3309
02:33:00,751 --> 02:33:02,700
You never should think,
don't fuck this up.

3310
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:05,460
Yeah,
and to me there's massive parallels with

3311
02:33:05,490 --> 02:33:06,630
mma,
martial arts,

3312
02:33:07,110 --> 02:33:09,120
but also with pr,
with playing pool,

3313
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:11,400
like if you're about to shoot a basket,
I say to bring it up,

3314
02:33:11,700 --> 02:33:12,431
don't mess,
don't mess,

3315
02:33:12,431 --> 02:33:13,890
don't mess.
You're going to fuck in

3316
02:33:16,550 --> 02:33:19,750
to go where you want,
but also there's no part of pool.

3317
02:33:20,370 --> 02:33:22,300
if the ball goes where you didn't intend
it to,

3318
02:33:22,780 --> 02:33:23,613
an anImal gets made right?
The consequences are so much so you can 

3319
02:33:26,621 --> 02:33:27,454
equate the consequences in your mind to 
be successful because at some level you 

3320
02:33:29,681 --> 02:33:31,960
have to write.
It has to be an important motion for you

3321
02:33:31,961 --> 02:33:33,370
to,
to really care to do it right.

3322
02:33:34,090 --> 02:33:36,700
But there's a real.
And that's why I say like,

3323
02:33:37,540 --> 02:33:41,710
one of the reasons why I continue to do 
what I do is because this is,

3324
02:33:41,890 --> 02:33:42,723
this thing is complex and I see other 
people's confusion around it and I 

3325
02:33:46,361 --> 02:33:47,194
appreciate their confusion and I 
understand that it's hard to get and I 

3326
02:33:52,420 --> 02:33:55,000
desperately want to find ways to like 
make it easier.

3327
02:33:55,100 --> 02:34:00,100
An analogy would be for pool,
imagine if every time you played pool,

3328
02:34:00,350 --> 02:34:01,183
you waited days and days for one shot 
and you didn't know what the shot would 

3329
02:34:06,621 --> 02:34:07,454
be and sometimes you had to shoot it 
quickly and if you missed and didn't 

3330
02:34:10,641 --> 02:34:11,474
make the shot,
an animal would scream out in agony and 

3331
02:34:14,901 --> 02:34:17,950
die a slow death and you would be for 
months.

3332
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:18,993
That's when you think about how 
difficult it is to perform under that 

3333
02:34:22,751 --> 02:34:23,870
moment.
The,

3334
02:34:24,180 --> 02:34:24,691
the,
the,

3335
02:34:24,691 --> 02:34:28,390
this,
this intense pressure of the one moment.

3336
02:34:30,340 --> 02:34:31,280
IT's like nothing else

3337
02:34:31,330 --> 02:34:33,040
that stressed me out.
Just thinking about it because it is,

3338
02:34:33,070 --> 02:34:34,720
it's real life though,
I guess.

3339
02:34:35,270 --> 02:34:36,103
Um,
I think steve rinella probably said it 

3340
02:34:37,810 --> 02:34:39,960
at some point or you did,
or somebody really smart did this.

3341
02:34:39,970 --> 02:34:42,490
Like it's a three dimensional 
experience.

3342
02:34:42,510 --> 02:34:45,100
It includes like riding a rollercoaster 
is thrilling,

3343
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,730
but the third dimension isn't there 
because when you get off,

3344
02:34:48,731 --> 02:34:51,190
nothing happened really.
You got the thrill,

3345
02:34:51,191 --> 02:34:52,024
but there was no consequence of the 
thrill and really that's kind of the 

3346
02:34:54,281 --> 02:34:55,890
point of buying a ticket to ride on a 
rollercoaster,

3347
02:34:55,970 --> 02:34:56,803
getting a thrill without having to take 
part in anything substantial with 

3348
02:35:00,401 --> 02:35:02,710
hunting there is thrilled.
There's fun.

3349
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:04,113
Everybody's seen videos of dudes hooping
and hollering and hugging you and I've 

3350
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:08,193
done it around the killing of an animal.
It's not that because I always asked 

3351
02:35:10,931 --> 02:35:12,670
myself like some really key questions 
like,

3352
02:35:12,671 --> 02:35:15,580
why is killing gratifying?
Like what's.

3353
02:35:15,670 --> 02:35:17,830
What's the answer to that?
Really?

3354
02:35:17,860 --> 02:35:20,440
What's the answer to that?
And I was like,

3355
02:35:20,470 --> 02:35:21,790
man,
that's going to be hard to explain.

3356
02:35:21,810 --> 02:35:22,643
There's a bunch of things going on,
but he hard to explain one to someone 

3357
02:35:25,501 --> 02:35:26,334
who doesn't know what it is.
One thing that's going on is you just 

3358
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:29,753
accomplished something that's insanely 
hard to do and you're relieved that 

3359
02:35:32,731 --> 02:35:37,440
their animal died and that relief 
manifests itself in a exuberance.

3360
02:35:37,710 --> 02:35:40,020
You high five,
you hug,

3361
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:41,491
he let go.
You go,

3362
02:35:41,491 --> 02:35:42,324
fuck that.
You're happy that it happened and it 

3363
02:35:45,390 --> 02:35:47,520
died quickly.
That's a big part of it.

3364
02:35:47,590 --> 02:35:49,110
That is.
That is a part of it.

3365
02:35:49,350 --> 02:35:49,731
Yeah,
and I'm.

3366
02:35:49,731 --> 02:35:51,570
I'm.
I've made just like post on social media

3367
02:35:51,571 --> 02:35:54,060
yesterday around like grip and grins,
grip and grants,

3368
02:35:54,061 --> 02:35:54,894
man a year.
You're anti agrippa grid for a long 

3369
02:35:55,921 --> 02:35:58,500
time.
Gave a big sticking point.

3370
02:35:58,620 --> 02:36:01,230
It did explain to grip and grin for the 
uneducated.

3371
02:36:01,700 --> 02:36:02,910
we were talking about us talking about 
this,

3372
02:36:02,911 --> 02:36:05,280
about we're going to try to write an 
article for the mediator.com

3373
02:36:05,281 --> 02:36:07,910
about a pub.
A grip and grin is there's.

3374
02:36:08,170 --> 02:36:09,750
I mean there's,
this goes back many,

3375
02:36:09,751 --> 02:36:12,120
many years.
I mean it goes back to teddy roosevelt.

3376
02:36:12,180 --> 02:36:13,013
it goes back to the turn of the century.
Market heart is like the photos we 

3377
02:36:15,391 --> 02:36:16,224
showed earlier.
Taking a photo with the thing you just 

3378
02:36:18,421 --> 02:36:20,280
killed.
His is no new thing to us.

3379
02:36:20,370 --> 02:36:21,960
It's as old as photos is the oldest 
photos.

3380
02:36:22,050 --> 02:36:24,300
Grip and grin just means you're with the
animal,

3381
02:36:24,301 --> 02:36:25,134
you're gripping,
its antlers are gripping apart of the 

3382
02:36:26,191 --> 02:36:30,240
animal and you're smiling and you're 
happy that you did that.

3383
02:36:31,110 --> 02:36:33,930
Um,
what I think what I would say about grip

3384
02:36:33,931 --> 02:36:36,330
and grins is that it's been weaponized,
right?

3385
02:36:36,331 --> 02:36:37,164
We,
everybody that's listening to this may 

3386
02:36:38,450 --> 02:36:41,720
is likely seen the girl with the girl,
the giraffe,

3387
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:43,430
the guy with the lion,
the girl,

3388
02:36:43,660 --> 02:36:46,490
the other girl did the giraffe,
the guy with the baboons.

3389
02:36:46,900 --> 02:36:49,490
It's been weaponized and it's,
it's,

3390
02:36:49,870 --> 02:36:52,920
it's been weaponized to a point where 
it's the thing,

3391
02:36:53,370 --> 02:36:56,400
the first thing that somebody like say,
like ricky gervais' might.

3392
02:36:56,610 --> 02:36:59,010
he finds this thing online.
He eats meat by the way.

3393
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:01,770
He does.
How about that?

3394
02:37:02,220 --> 02:37:03,460
How about that?
How about that?

3395
02:37:03,470 --> 02:37:04,303
Do you ever had him on here?

3396
02:37:04,430 --> 02:37:05,263
No,
but I talked to him and opie and 

3397
02:37:05,750 --> 02:37:06,620
anthony,
so nice guy.

3398
02:37:07,890 --> 02:37:10,050
I remember listening to the people 
hunting if they eat the meat.

3399
02:37:10,290 --> 02:37:11,010
Yeah.
And it's like,

3400
02:37:11,010 --> 02:37:13,280
so,
so we've weaponized the term trophy with

3401
02:37:13,290 --> 02:37:17,080
weaponize this script and can thing and 
the um,

3402
02:37:18,470 --> 02:37:19,303
society and we know,
I know that honey is the honey was a 

3403
02:37:23,091 --> 02:37:23,924
business.
Not a lot of people would buy stock in 

3404
02:37:24,801 --> 02:37:26,960
it.
I mean there's less people doing it.

3405
02:37:27,140 --> 02:37:27,973
It's less relevant to society and the 
weapon that a lot of folks are using 

3406
02:37:31,341 --> 02:37:32,174
that don't like it is this photo and the
photo depicts a person smiling next to 

3407
02:37:38,211 --> 02:37:39,044
or overtop of a dead animal.
And so at its face it absolutely says 

3408
02:37:44,450 --> 02:37:46,670
I'm happy that there's a dead animal in 
front of me.

3409
02:37:46,730 --> 02:37:49,280
It's not enough information for such a 
significant moment.

3410
02:37:49,490 --> 02:37:51,860
And that's what.
So what I've said around like around the

3411
02:37:51,861 --> 02:37:53,420
photo is it happened for a very long 
time,

3412
02:37:53,421 --> 02:37:54,920
but then social media became a deal.

3413
02:37:55,130 --> 02:37:58,400
Right.
And during the eighties and nineties,

3414
02:37:58,401 --> 02:37:59,234
grip and grins were like,
I remember going to like my first trade 

3415
02:38:01,521 --> 02:38:06,521
shows as a kid or in people would have 
like flip books of grip and grins.

3416
02:38:08,110 --> 02:38:09,140
They would like get them out and be 
like,

3417
02:38:09,141 --> 02:38:11,540
you see what I killed this year before,
before cell phones or whatever.

3418
02:38:11,541 --> 02:38:12,830
They would bring them out and be like,
look at that,

3419
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:15,320
look at all the things I killed.
And it was like this,

3420
02:38:15,321 --> 02:38:16,154
this,
this communication between hunters that 

3421
02:38:17,541 --> 02:38:21,070
was legit.
Like I know what a gripping rain is.

3422
02:38:21,080 --> 02:38:25,310
I'm not questioning it,
but then social media becomes prevalent.

3423
02:38:25,311 --> 02:38:26,144
people start posting these photos to 
everyone where they can control the 

3424
02:38:29,571 --> 02:38:33,260
messaging anymore and it's,
it's one of the easiest things,

3425
02:38:33,261 --> 02:38:36,440
one of the most oxymoronic thanks to go 
pluck from hunting and be like,

3426
02:38:36,560 --> 02:38:38,600
don't understand this,
this looks fucked up.

3427
02:38:39,020 --> 02:38:42,530
Let me apply that to trophy hunting and 
let me damn this person for this photo.

3428
02:38:43,340 --> 02:38:45,680
And so with that lady with the goat 
recently.

3429
02:38:45,681 --> 02:38:46,514
Yeah.

3430
02:38:47,020 --> 02:38:50,320
Invasive species on an island where they
have to kill it.

3431
02:38:50,321 --> 02:38:53,470
It's killing all,
all the native wildlife.

3432
02:38:53,471 --> 02:38:53,660
Yep.

3433
02:38:53,660 --> 02:38:57,350
but then later on they find that there's
a photo of that young lady with a bloody

3434
02:38:57,380 --> 02:39:01,730
dildo and got blood on it.
Did you not hear about that part?

3435
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:02,360
What?
Yeah,

3436
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:04,400
we're going to have to get that on the 
old google machine.

3437
02:39:05,470 --> 02:39:06,303
Yeah.
That's a tough subject for three hours 

3438
02:39:07,041 --> 02:39:07,874
in.
But that happened.

3439
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:10,580
Um,
what do you mean?

3440
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:14,070
Just put up stuff that's hard for me to 
explaIn this.

3441
02:39:14,210 --> 02:39:15,043
There was like a,
some sort of bachelorette party or 

3442
02:39:16,431 --> 02:39:17,530
something.
And that young lady.

3443
02:39:17,560 --> 02:39:19,700
The same lady that was in the skyland,
correct?

3444
02:39:19,790 --> 02:39:20,930
Yes.
Um,

3445
02:39:20,960 --> 02:39:25,960
with the goat was also photographed with
a bloody dildo goat blood.

3446
02:39:27,790 --> 02:39:28,623
I believe so.

3447
02:39:29,450 --> 02:39:32,870
Why was she trying to say?
I don't know.

3448
02:39:33,380 --> 02:39:34,213
Maybe she just partying.
She could have been just having a great 

3449
02:39:35,991 --> 02:39:38,390
time.
What if is a photo with me with a bloody

3450
02:39:38,391 --> 02:39:41,160
deal though.
You would go figures like at them rogan.

3451
02:39:42,090 --> 02:39:45,560
Good.
That jambo jambo dildo.

3452
02:39:45,680 --> 02:39:46,730
He's had too much.
Right brain.

3453
02:39:46,760 --> 02:39:48,710
I hope I'm right about that and just 
make that up.

3454
02:39:48,990 --> 02:39:52,320
No,
but we've discussed that internally at a

3455
02:39:52,321 --> 02:39:55,410
bunch.
Jamie say hit me up,

3456
02:39:55,411 --> 02:39:56,460
jamie.
What's up?

3457
02:39:57,840 --> 02:40:00,030
It's like the fist thing.

3458
02:40:00,220 --> 02:40:01,900
It doesn't look like it did sound like a
dildo.

3459
02:40:01,910 --> 02:40:03,140
Like you're thinking of.
Oh,

3460
02:40:03,141 --> 02:40:04,920
it's like a fist dildo.
Is it a.

3461
02:40:04,950 --> 02:40:07,080
I'm not going to show.
Oh yeah.

3462
02:40:07,100 --> 02:40:10,320
I can show you guys keep it to himself.
There you go.

3463
02:40:10,350 --> 02:40:11,183
Okay.
That,

3464
02:40:11,340 --> 02:40:12,560
that's,
that's the thing.

3465
02:40:12,900 --> 02:40:13,890
Okay.
Oh,

3466
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:14,140
it's

3467
02:40:14,140 --> 02:40:15,360
just,
it's a fist.

3468
02:40:15,720 --> 02:40:16,830
Is that for fisting?

3469
02:40:18,300 --> 02:40:21,300
This is hunter and blah blah blah.
Slam for photo with dead.

3470
02:40:21,301 --> 02:40:22,980
She bloody sex toy.

3471
02:40:23,880 --> 02:40:25,760
Um,
okay.

3472
02:40:25,780 --> 02:40:28,180
That's fox news.
Huh?

3473
02:40:28,240 --> 02:40:31,540
So that's recently.
is this recent?

3474
02:40:31,570 --> 02:40:32,381
When is this?
Yeah,

3475
02:40:32,381 --> 02:40:33,390
this is november.
Remember?

3476
02:40:33,950 --> 02:40:34,783
This is recent.
So it's quite a few months after the 

3477
02:40:38,020 --> 02:40:38,853
Initial image was.
So this is a different animal she's 

3478
02:40:41,051 --> 02:40:42,190
with.
It looks like some.

3479
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:43,880
She's got one,
she's got there,

3480
02:40:43,890 --> 02:40:44,723
it looks like an ibex,
and then she's got what looks like a 

3481
02:40:46,721 --> 02:40:49,390
moot,
another dead animal on british soil.

3482
02:40:50,500 --> 02:40:51,333
um,
she posed with a sex toy and the dead 

3483
02:40:54,070 --> 02:40:55,330
sheep.
Well,

3484
02:40:56,230 --> 02:40:58,230
maybe there's some context to it.
I mean maybe it was a.

3485
02:40:58,510 --> 02:40:59,530
I don't.
Like I said I don't.

3486
02:40:59,570 --> 02:41:02,320
I lost a bet.
It doesn't look good.

3487
02:41:02,321 --> 02:41:03,550
Let's just say that.
Yeah.

3488
02:41:03,970 --> 02:41:05,620
In the context of the husband said,
listen,

3489
02:41:07,030 --> 02:41:10,480
if you do shoot one,
this is what you have to do a.

3490
02:41:10,540 --> 02:41:12,310
Maybe there was a bed that's,
I don't know.

3491
02:41:12,311 --> 02:41:13,920
I need the details around.
But that Photo.

3492
02:41:13,921 --> 02:41:15,630
Is it just like the baboons one?
Just

3493
02:41:15,820 --> 02:41:17,080
don't look good.
what are you saying,

3494
02:41:17,620 --> 02:41:19,300
jamie?
Okay.

3495
02:41:19,690 --> 02:41:20,523
It says,
gearing said that the marital aid had 

3496
02:41:22,541 --> 02:41:26,440
been given as a birthday present,
but said swift lik,

3497
02:41:26,740 --> 02:41:27,820
how do you say your name?
Swindling,

3498
02:41:27,910 --> 02:41:28,743
sweat,
lick.

3499
02:41:28,870 --> 02:41:31,930
Sort of rude and arrogant throughout the
trip.

3500
02:41:31,960 --> 02:41:36,960
Who's gearing a think?
Must have been her international host.

3501
02:41:37,240 --> 02:41:41,800
Maybe she's british.
Jumped on the trip with one of the women

3502
02:41:41,801 --> 02:41:43,300
on the trip.
Okay.

3503
02:41:43,480 --> 02:41:44,313
Well,
that sounds like two chicks and get 

3504
02:41:44,921 --> 02:41:48,700
along to hear her side of it.
It was a bit of fun during the party.

3505
02:41:48,850 --> 02:41:49,683
We.
Marital aid is given as a birthday 

3506
02:41:52,181 --> 02:41:53,014
prison

3507
02:41:53,730 --> 02:41:55,650
to an hour.
I have no idea why I was brought out the

3508
02:41:55,651 --> 02:41:57,860
following day on the hunt.
It was an appalling thing to do.

3509
02:41:58,020 --> 02:41:59,910
Please show disrespect to the animal she
did.

3510
02:41:59,970 --> 02:42:00,803
She has just killed the animal.
Doesn't know because it was dead and I 

3511
02:42:05,580 --> 02:42:06,930
don't.
I mean,

3512
02:42:07,230 --> 02:42:10,550
it's weird,
but I don't know.

3513
02:42:10,790 --> 02:42:11,623
I don't know if I'm horrified by.
I'm not friends with her any longer and 

3514
02:42:15,331 --> 02:42:16,164
in fact she's the reason that I left 
early because I was so against what she 

3515
02:42:18,931 --> 02:42:22,440
stood for and her more.
I don't want to read this.

3516
02:42:22,870 --> 02:42:24,510
Don't know.
Chicks,

3517
02:42:25,150 --> 02:42:25,983
chicks.
Ladies,

3518
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:26,833
I love you.
I don't know that person contact with 

3519
02:42:28,411 --> 02:42:30,840
each other.
I've never met that person.

3520
02:42:30,841 --> 02:42:32,760
I don't know them.
but that happens like this.

3521
02:42:32,790 --> 02:42:33,623
This is just an example of who knows the
weaponizing of these situations where 

3522
02:42:38,070 --> 02:42:41,970
somebody dildos get pulled out and 
everybody gets upset every time.

3523
02:42:42,320 --> 02:42:43,860
Um,
I did not know about that though.

3524
02:42:43,930 --> 02:42:45,930
Yeah,
it's interesting.

3525
02:42:46,140 --> 02:42:47,970
That's one,
one example,

3526
02:42:47,971 --> 02:42:48,804
but that's,
that's what ends up happening around 

3527
02:42:49,921 --> 02:42:50,790
these images.
Now,

3528
02:42:51,060 --> 02:42:54,030
when I posted this thing the other day,
half people would say like,

3529
02:42:54,330 --> 02:42:55,163
don't stop doing what you're doing.
If you feel it's right and you feel 

3530
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:00,930
respectful as a hunter and you're 
telling the entire story,

3531
02:43:00,940 --> 02:43:03,840
and part of that story is to sit behind 
the ambulance,

3532
02:43:03,841 --> 02:43:06,840
smile and and signify how great you feel
about it.

3533
02:43:06,930 --> 02:43:08,340
Then go for it.
Exactly.

3534
02:43:08,341 --> 02:43:09,174
That's what you should be doing.
Don't let someone else change your 

3535
02:43:10,711 --> 02:43:11,544
behavior.

3536
02:43:11,650 --> 02:43:12,483
The other side of things is like every 
hunter has a chance to impact somebody 

3537
02:43:15,461 --> 02:43:17,290
that doesn't go hunting.
Every hunter,

3538
02:43:17,380 --> 02:43:18,213
there's 11 million hunters.
They have a chance to impact the 

3539
02:43:21,191 --> 02:43:22,024
millions and millions of folks who 
aren't exposed to hunting at any point 

3540
02:43:25,571 --> 02:43:28,270
in their lives,
and so I can see.

3541
02:43:28,271 --> 02:43:30,680
I can really see both things,
but for me it's.

3542
02:43:30,890 --> 02:43:31,723
It's an issue of if I want honey to 
continue in the way that it does and I 

3543
02:43:36,191 --> 02:43:40,090
want my social media privileges to make 
hunting better,

3544
02:43:40,450 --> 02:43:43,420
I would probably choose not to put that 
out there unless it was in the context I

3545
02:43:43,421 --> 02:43:45,550
felt very comfortable with.
That's very fair.

3546
02:43:45,790 --> 02:43:48,880
It's not just fair,
it's honest and um,

3547
02:43:48,930 --> 02:43:49,763
it makes sense,
but obviously if you had those photos 

3548
02:43:52,201 --> 02:43:53,910
and you show them to someone like me 
who's hunted,

3549
02:43:53,911 --> 02:43:55,230
it wouldn't bother me at all and be 
like,

3550
02:43:55,270 --> 02:43:56,490
oh,
you got a nice deer.

3551
02:43:56,510 --> 02:43:57,343
It's all about context.
It's all like I could slide it across 

3552
02:43:58,881 --> 02:44:00,530
the table to you or texted to you and 
you would say,

3553
02:44:00,830 --> 02:44:02,210
cool man,
congratulations.

3554
02:44:02,260 --> 02:44:05,950
You and I have been on several hunts.
We know what it's like.

3555
02:44:05,951 --> 02:44:06,784
We,
we,

3556
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:07,790
we,
there's no,

3557
02:44:07,900 --> 02:44:08,733
we don't have to explain what it is.
The problem is it's like fast food for 

3558
02:44:12,011 --> 02:44:13,780
an idea.
You're just,

3559
02:44:13,990 --> 02:44:16,570
it's a tiny little thing.
It's not real.

3560
02:44:16,571 --> 02:44:17,404
You're not,
you're not getting the full context of 

3561
02:44:18,821 --> 02:44:22,360
where the food came from or how the 
animal was raised and how was killed and

3562
02:44:22,361 --> 02:44:23,194
turned into a burger.
You just getting the burger real quick 

3563
02:44:24,490 --> 02:44:25,760
and this is what you're getting with the
photo.

3564
02:44:25,780 --> 02:44:26,810
You just getting a photo.
Yeah.

3565
02:44:26,860 --> 02:44:27,693
not getting the full context of the 
experience that led up to you shooting 

3566
02:44:31,001 --> 02:44:33,730
this deer that might be like this 200 
inch mule deer.

3567
02:44:33,731 --> 02:44:35,140
that's the deer.
Have a lifetime.

3568
02:44:35,150 --> 02:44:36,150
You have this giant smile on.

3569
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:37,033
You're like,

3570
02:44:37,540 --> 02:44:41,790
believe you outwitted this old monarch 
of the forest and put an arrow in his.

3571
02:44:41,791 --> 02:44:42,300
Ah,
his,

3572
02:44:42,300 --> 02:44:43,270
his rib cage

3573
02:44:43,350 --> 02:44:44,320
for sure.
And I.

3574
02:44:44,321 --> 02:44:48,900
And I think that that's a totally 
legitimate way to express your hunting.

3575
02:44:49,620 --> 02:44:52,200
For me.
If you were to ask me today,

3576
02:44:52,201 --> 02:44:53,034
I would say I would probably not give 
anybody the chance to misrepresent my 

3577
02:44:55,891 --> 02:44:56,724
shit.
I don't put pictures like that up 

3578
02:44:57,961 --> 02:44:58,794
anymore.
You don't.

3579
02:44:59,220 --> 02:45:01,080
Same reason,
but I don't in the past,

3580
02:45:01,081 --> 02:45:03,400
but I've put a lot of elk meat up.
Woo.

3581
02:45:04,320 --> 02:45:06,060
For me it's like I,
I put the meet up,

3582
02:45:06,061 --> 02:45:08,400
I put all the whole story up,
but if I was to say,

3583
02:45:08,401 --> 02:45:09,234
like I always said in the very beginning
of the whole me not liking grip and 

3584
02:45:12,271 --> 02:45:13,870
grins conversation,
I said,

3585
02:45:13,871 --> 02:45:14,730
if,
if someone had said,

3586
02:45:14,731 --> 02:45:15,564
ben,
can you give that up for the betterment 

3587
02:45:17,071 --> 02:45:17,904
of haunting?
Like could you just give that one thing 

3588
02:45:19,591 --> 02:45:20,424
up?
That's traditionally it's been done for 

3589
02:45:21,210 --> 02:45:24,240
decades or for a guy kills the thing 
that sits in front of it.

3590
02:45:24,280 --> 02:45:25,113
Yeah.
would you be willing to give that up if 

3591
02:45:27,630 --> 02:45:29,220
for some way,
shape or form?

3592
02:45:29,221 --> 02:45:30,054
Even if you didn't agree with it,
it made for a better hunting to hunter 

3593
02:45:34,231 --> 02:45:35,670
to non hunter relationship.
I was like,

3594
02:45:35,671 --> 02:45:36,560
fuck yeah man.
Yeah,

3595
02:45:36,580 --> 02:45:37,540
I'm down for that.
Yeah,

3596
02:45:37,740 --> 02:45:38,573
and so I think that's what the 
conversation is now is trying to 

3597
02:45:41,490 --> 02:45:45,360
determine is that the best thing or not.
I,

3598
02:45:45,370 --> 02:45:46,530
I'm not sure I have the answers.

3599
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:49,850
I think for anybody who's listening to 
this three hour conversation and sort of

3600
02:45:49,851 --> 02:45:51,590
gets an understanding of where we're 
coming from,

3601
02:45:51,620 --> 02:45:54,500
they'll appreciate that there's a lot of
thought involved here.

3602
02:45:54,980 --> 02:45:58,130
For anybody that sees that photograph of
you smiling with a dead bear,

3603
02:45:58,131 --> 02:45:58,964
they're not going to appreciate that and
it's going to be real quick and they're 

3604
02:46:00,741 --> 02:46:01,574
gonna have this.
How many people are willing to sit here 

3605
02:46:03,770 --> 02:46:04,603
and listen to this whole conversation 
and get to get an understanding of how 

3606
02:46:08,871 --> 02:46:10,040
your works and

3607
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:10,873
how you think about things.
Not nearly as many as we'll look at a 

3608
02:46:13,641 --> 02:46:14,990
photo and go,
that guy's a cunt,

3609
02:46:15,710 --> 02:46:17,550
you know,
and that's the ricky gervais' tack,

3610
02:46:17,730 --> 02:46:18,563
right?
As much as I do enjoy re ricky's comedy 

3611
02:46:21,141 --> 02:46:23,540
and when he looks at these things like 
that,

3612
02:46:23,690 --> 02:46:26,180
first of all,
that fucking giraffe one,

3613
02:46:26,200 --> 02:46:27,033
that's a rough one,
was super complicated and glenn 

3614
02:46:29,001 --> 02:46:29,834
greenwald and all these other people,
they sicked a lot of people and that 

3615
02:46:31,821 --> 02:46:33,980
lady,
that giraffe had to be killed.

3616
02:46:34,190 --> 02:46:35,023
That giraffe apparently had killed at 
least two or three bowls and it was a 

3617
02:46:39,531 --> 02:46:43,070
non-viable male and they made it out 
like it was just rare giraffe.

3618
02:46:43,100 --> 02:46:43,933
It's rare because it's old.
It was dark because the dark ones or 

3619
02:46:46,371 --> 02:46:48,050
older ones,
but that's.

3620
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:50,150
We always get down these rabbit holes.
They think somebody says,

3621
02:46:50,151 --> 02:46:50,984
I'm mad about this photo and the next 
thing we know we're debating the age of 

3622
02:46:52,851 --> 02:46:55,070
a fucking single giraffe because like it
matters.

3623
02:46:56,120 --> 02:46:59,330
It does matter,
but it doesn't matter to the extent that

3624
02:46:59,331 --> 02:47:00,164
they try to make it.
They don't understand what they're 

3625
02:47:01,401 --> 02:47:02,234
looking at,
but they are looking at something that 

3626
02:47:03,801 --> 02:47:05,900
they find displeasing.
Yes.

3627
02:47:05,930 --> 02:47:07,730
And that's,
you're right about that.

3628
02:47:07,731 --> 02:47:09,500
And I find a displeasing as well.
I'm like,

3629
02:47:09,560 --> 02:47:10,580
when I see that,
I'm like,

3630
02:47:10,581 --> 02:47:11,990
listen,
I'm not a giraffe hunter.

3631
02:47:12,080 --> 02:47:14,780
I've never been to that part of africa.
I don't know that person,

3632
02:47:15,050 --> 02:47:15,883
but just to look at that,
I feel the same way as everyone else 

3633
02:47:17,570 --> 02:47:19,810
because giraffes are awesome.
The thing about dress,

3634
02:47:19,820 --> 02:47:20,653
I had a bit about my act like they're 
the only animal that looks fine with 

3635
02:47:24,321 --> 02:47:25,530
being in the zoo.
Yeah.

3636
02:47:25,810 --> 02:47:26,643
Like another day with no lions,
just strolling around babies feed 

3637
02:47:31,041 --> 02:47:32,240
giraffes.
My fucking daughter,

3638
02:47:32,241 --> 02:47:33,074
when she was two,
I held her up and she had a piece of 

3639
02:47:34,701 --> 02:47:37,820
leaf and she put it out there and the 
draft comes over.

3640
02:47:37,880 --> 02:47:40,700
It's the only animal that they let 
babies feed.

3641
02:47:41,180 --> 02:47:42,980
They don't let little kids feed polar 
bears.

3642
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:47,840
Fucking piller piller fuck you.
Let it be dining on fingers.

3643
02:47:47,841 --> 02:47:49,720
Yeah.
Give me your arm man.

3644
02:47:49,850 --> 02:47:51,500
So I,
I get.

3645
02:47:52,310 --> 02:47:53,091
You're right.
No,

3646
02:47:53,091 --> 02:47:55,520
you're right.
It might make sense.

3647
02:47:55,550 --> 02:47:58,070
I want it to be better.
I want the conversation between,

3648
02:47:58,071 --> 02:47:58,904
not between the ricky gervais',
ricky gervais' acts like an asshole in 

3649
02:48:02,481 --> 02:48:06,290
this context.
He enjoys getting angry people,

3650
02:48:06,291 --> 02:48:07,124
but in his defense,
the stereotypical hunter that is in his 

3651
02:48:11,331 --> 02:48:14,750
mind what he's fighting against is an 
asshole.

3652
02:48:14,780 --> 02:48:15,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

3653
02:48:15,720 --> 02:48:16,910
And I would agree and I would be like,
dude,

3654
02:48:16,911 --> 02:48:18,470
I agree with you.
Most agree with you.

3655
02:48:18,970 --> 02:48:22,880
Fat guy wants to fly to africa and shoot
an elephant and is not even going to eat

3656
02:48:22,881 --> 02:48:23,714
it.
And he just wants it because he's 

3657
02:48:25,340 --> 02:48:26,820
getting the big eight.
There wasn't.

3658
02:48:27,160 --> 02:48:28,320
There's a lot of weird shit.

3659
02:48:28,320 --> 02:48:28,930
Yeah,
problem.

3660
02:48:28,930 --> 02:48:29,763
The problem I have with that is like 
this specifically calling out that 

3661
02:48:32,451 --> 02:48:33,284
single person or a smaller group subset 
of hunters that you don't agree with to 

3662
02:48:36,861 --> 02:48:41,540
paint the entire group like that.
They think that that's the only way they

3663
02:48:41,541 --> 02:48:42,374
can get people to stop.
They think that what they've done with 

3664
02:48:44,871 --> 02:48:47,300
cecil look,
they enacted real change.

3665
02:48:47,390 --> 02:48:50,540
There has been real change around a lot 
of this stuff with with cecil.

3666
02:48:50,541 --> 02:48:51,374
They enacted real change,
but unfortunately a lot of it has been 

3667
02:48:53,121 --> 02:48:57,110
negative with people don't understand is
how much it costs.

3668
02:48:57,111 --> 02:48:57,944
The people that lived there and about 
these hunting concessions get closed 

3669
02:49:01,041 --> 02:49:01,874
down and then these animals go wild and 
then what happens is poachers just take 

3670
02:49:05,121 --> 02:49:07,980
over and a lot of the animals get the 
same way

3671
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:10,860
they did in the United States before 
market hunting was outlawed.

3672
02:49:10,900 --> 02:49:13,090
When you look at what,
what a concession is,

3673
02:49:13,091 --> 02:49:15,000
right?
A concession in this happen,

3674
02:49:15,060 --> 02:49:15,893
I want to say it happened in like the 
late seventies and early eighties in 

3675
02:49:17,341 --> 02:49:18,174
africa where there was especially 
antelope and african antelope and all 

3676
02:49:22,201 --> 02:49:23,490
these other species that were there.
They were.

3677
02:49:23,550 --> 02:49:25,710
They were not at the brink of 
extinction,

3678
02:49:25,711 --> 02:49:26,544
but they were suffering.
A concession is essentially a bunch of 

3679
02:49:28,921 --> 02:49:30,300
ranch land owners get together and be 
like,

3680
02:49:30,301 --> 02:49:33,150
let's put a fence around our stuff to 
keep everything,

3681
02:49:33,240 --> 02:49:35,370
keep poachers out and keep the animals 
in.

3682
02:49:36,060 --> 02:49:37,820
Once you know,
in africa wins,

3683
02:49:37,860 --> 02:49:40,680
especially south african.
When concessions became prevalent,

3684
02:49:41,460 --> 02:49:44,370
a wildlife populations skyrocketed,
you know,

3685
02:49:44,430 --> 02:49:46,350
tripled,
doubled times 10,

3686
02:49:46,530 --> 02:49:48,680
hundreds of thousands of analysts that 
were there before.

3687
02:49:48,690 --> 02:49:49,523
They're actually.
Because that's the only way they could 

3688
02:49:51,241 --> 02:49:54,060
have value value because they have 
monetary value.

3689
02:49:54,090 --> 02:49:55,140
Yeah.
And I'm not.

3690
02:49:55,950 --> 02:49:57,940
I'm conflicted about that too.
Yeah,

3691
02:49:58,140 --> 02:50:00,390
I'm conflicted about it.
It's like a thing that worked,

3692
02:50:01,200 --> 02:50:03,240
but is that the way I don't.
I don't know.

3693
02:50:03,390 --> 02:50:04,223
I've been over there.
I'll probably never go back over there 

3694
02:50:07,380 --> 02:50:10,590
because there's just so many things in 
this north America I'd like to pursue,

3695
02:50:10,591 --> 02:50:13,380
but like it's something that I was 
involved,

3696
02:50:13,381 --> 02:50:15,750
like I went and did and I realized,
hey look,

3697
02:50:16,440 --> 02:50:17,273
this is way too complicated and,
and if there's too much way too much 

3698
02:50:20,521 --> 02:50:23,190
american influence based on the money we
bring you over there,

3699
02:50:23,820 --> 02:50:26,850
that isn't rooted in exactly what's good
for africa.

3700
02:50:26,910 --> 02:50:27,743
Right.
So I think like african hunting is 

3701
02:50:31,261 --> 02:50:33,720
valuable.
It's like you can paint that picture all

3702
02:50:33,721 --> 02:50:35,520
day long.
It can be like this is,

3703
02:50:35,521 --> 02:50:36,354
it's valuable,
it's value for these reasons and nobody 

3704
02:50:38,461 --> 02:50:40,890
can really argue like the end result of 
the thing,

3705
02:50:41,160 --> 02:50:41,993
but what's being argued argued the end 
result because it's been so much more 

3706
02:50:44,281 --> 02:50:47,070
effective than just conservation based 
on donations.

3707
02:50:47,160 --> 02:50:47,993
Yeah.
And that's what people don't understand 

3708
02:50:49,201 --> 02:50:50,034
that argue against it.
You're wrong when it comes to the 

3709
02:50:52,410 --> 02:50:54,240
numbers,
the numbers are wrong.

3710
02:50:54,720 --> 02:50:57,900
You would like to think that people 
hunting zebras don't help,

3711
02:50:58,350 --> 02:50:59,630
but they do.
Yeah.

3712
02:50:59,631 --> 02:51:00,464
That's what they help way more than 
people that go over there to take 

3713
02:51:01,891 --> 02:51:02,790
photographs.
Yeah.

3714
02:51:02,791 --> 02:51:03,624
So,
so am I willing to say like get rid of 

3715
02:51:04,891 --> 02:51:06,960
that so I can feel better about hunting?
No,

3716
02:51:06,990 --> 02:51:09,630
fuck no.
Because I want there to be more animals.

3717
02:51:10,230 --> 02:51:13,110
The number is so different in the amount
of money they contributed.

3718
02:51:13,111 --> 02:51:13,944
This is where people have to understand 
because they'll throw some numbers at 

3719
02:51:15,781 --> 02:51:18,690
you like you know,
5,000

3720
02:51:18,691 --> 02:51:20,850
people go to safari.
He's only 2000 people,

3721
02:51:20,851 --> 02:51:21,760
huh?
Yeah,

3722
02:51:21,780 --> 02:51:23,670
sure.
But the 2000 people that hunt,

3723
02:51:24,150 --> 02:51:26,730
they hunt and they spend way more 
fucking money.

3724
02:51:27,090 --> 02:51:30,010
It costs a lot of money to shoot a line.

3725
02:51:30,030 --> 02:51:30,863
It costs like $50,000
as much as you find line hunting 

3726
02:51:33,541 --> 02:51:34,374
distasteful.
You have to understand that if you 

3727
02:51:36,061 --> 02:51:39,300
remove it,
it's like when you take a dictator out.

3728
02:51:39,360 --> 02:51:41,430
Yeah.
And then you have like a power vacuum.

3729
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:43,990
How do you replace it?
Well,

3730
02:51:44,060 --> 02:51:44,893
and it's just like they're,
they're just some like on the ground 

3731
02:51:46,891 --> 02:51:49,110
things that happened to around,
look,

3732
02:51:49,500 --> 02:51:51,810
if you want to do wildlife viewing,
you gotta cut roads.

3733
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:55,040
Like you got to put.
If you want to do wildlife viewing,

3734
02:51:55,050 --> 02:51:57,720
people are going to pay less.
So it means you have to have more people

3735
02:51:57,760 --> 02:52:00,960
encroaching them on these places where 
these wild animals are.

3736
02:52:01,770 --> 02:52:02,603
You have to make parks where humans 
can't go in and you have to be prepared 

3737
02:52:06,221 --> 02:52:08,860
when humans get attacked by animals,
we're just going to fucking happen.

3738
02:52:08,890 --> 02:52:09,723
And so it's never as simple as it seems.
It is as simple as it seems to say like 

3739
02:52:13,490 --> 02:52:16,690
the numbers say that that african trophy
hunting is benefiting.

3740
02:52:16,690 --> 02:52:17,523
But bob life now,
is it benefiting in the way that 

3741
02:52:18,791 --> 02:52:21,430
everybody thinks is best?
That's debatable,

3742
02:52:21,850 --> 02:52:24,370
but you can't.
You can't sit here and say like,

3743
02:52:24,640 --> 02:52:26,920
if we end this today,
there'll be more game and be like,

3744
02:52:26,970 --> 02:52:29,500
it's probably the reverse is the 
reverse.

3745
02:52:29,501 --> 02:52:31,180
Probably the reverse.
It might,

3746
02:52:31,270 --> 02:52:33,130
it'll hurt your feelings,
but it's the reverse.

3747
02:52:33,290 --> 02:52:33,790
Yeah.
Um,

3748
02:52:33,790 --> 02:52:35,920
what's going on right now in africa 
with.

3749
02:52:35,950 --> 02:52:39,520
What were the exact area that cecil the 
lion happened in,

3750
02:52:39,880 --> 02:52:42,520
is that they had a call,
200 lions.

3751
02:52:42,820 --> 02:52:43,653
They had to shoot 200 lines,
which means they had to pay someone to 

3752
02:52:45,791 --> 02:52:47,820
go and shoot these lines because they 
are,

3753
02:52:48,280 --> 02:52:49,113
their population had gotten so high.
They were decimating the angelo 

3754
02:52:51,371 --> 02:52:52,204
population,
so all the antelope and all the 

3755
02:52:53,411 --> 02:52:55,990
different animals that the lines were 
haunting,

3756
02:52:55,991 --> 02:52:58,660
they were destroying them because they 
have to eat a lot man,

3757
02:52:58,690 --> 02:53:01,090
but you're a 600 pound cat and all you 
care.

3758
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:03,730
You're a.
You're a meat processor on four legs,

3759
02:53:03,731 --> 02:53:04,790
brow,
like there's no.

3760
02:53:04,810 --> 02:53:05,980
You can't be like,
hey listen man,

3761
02:53:06,250 --> 02:53:09,190
listen,
just lay off for a couple of weeks,

3762
02:53:09,940 --> 02:53:12,000
listen another,
do this.

3763
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,630
I know you really like to eat.
Also,

3764
02:53:16,790 --> 02:53:19,690
you know,
they were just breeding unchecked.

3765
02:53:20,600 --> 02:53:25,360
Their populations quickly got to very 
unmanageable number.

3766
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:26,433
Well,
it seems it's never as simple as it 

3767
02:53:28,271 --> 02:53:31,980
seems.
The mountain lions in California,

3768
02:53:32,030 --> 02:53:36,160
Washington and Oregon this year in 
Oregon and Washington to people,

3769
02:53:36,240 --> 02:53:39,010
poor killed one in each state that 
hasn't happened in 100 years.

3770
02:53:39,340 --> 02:53:40,173
You know,
I've talked to a lot of people that say 

3771
02:53:41,111 --> 02:53:43,840
that's an anomaly,
but it happened nonetheless.

3772
02:53:44,600 --> 02:53:46,710
It doesn't mean anything.
If it's an anomaly.

3773
02:53:46,720 --> 02:53:51,720
It's also a reality is it happens are 
predators and they're Big and they're.

3774
02:53:51,880 --> 02:53:55,360
They've killed I think 55 bears in the 
greater yellowstone ecosystem this year.

3775
02:53:55,361 --> 02:53:59,590
Just probably that number could be 
skewed In some way for me,

3776
02:53:59,591 --> 02:54:02,530
but I think that's what I heard a lot of
black bears,

3777
02:54:02,531 --> 02:54:05,400
right that invade into,
I think this was,

3778
02:54:05,410 --> 02:54:06,243
this was all grizzly bears that had 
either been hit by cars or nuisance or 

3779
02:54:10,541 --> 02:54:12,820
we're getting around somebody cattle 
that had been shot.

3780
02:54:12,820 --> 02:54:13,653
I think if that's the number,
you have to look that up and confirm 

3781
02:54:15,471 --> 02:54:18,520
them right about that because that's a 
pretty serious accusation if I'm wrong,

3782
02:54:19,030 --> 02:54:23,380
but you know that happens in that this.
So there's no simple.

3783
02:54:23,440 --> 02:54:24,273
there's no simple way to put it.
Just here with mountain lions mean 

3784
02:54:26,981 --> 02:54:29,440
mountain lion hunting is outlawed in 
California,

3785
02:54:29,441 --> 02:54:30,274
but they killed the same amount of 
mountain lions and the way they killed 

3786
02:54:32,411 --> 02:54:35,290
them as they have to hire people and 
they have to use public funds,

3787
02:54:35,291 --> 02:54:36,124
these tax dollars and they hire a guy 
with dogs to go catch these fucking 

3788
02:54:40,301 --> 02:54:41,440
cats.
KIll them.

Hours ago we talked about the north 

3791
02:54:45,101 --> 02:54:48,670
american model of wildlife conservation,
but that's a thing.

3792
02:54:49,720 --> 02:54:50,553
It's not infallible,
but it's pretty fucking close in my 

3793
02:54:51,791 --> 02:54:54,580
opinion.
It's a very good system and there's more
