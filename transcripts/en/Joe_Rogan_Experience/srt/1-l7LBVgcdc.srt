00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,080
How and we begin the Joe Rogan 
experience podcast is brought to you by 

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,580
the fleshlight.
If you go to Joe Rogan.net

3
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:14,100
and click on the link for the flashlight
and entering the code name,

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,700
Rogan,
you'll get 15 percent off the number one

5
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:21,701
sex toy for men.
It's a fucking solid product and we 

6
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:23,750
stand behind it.
We were also brought in front of a jail.

7
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:26,060
What kind of voice?
Like fucking are you doing it?

8
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:28,520
Putting it in your ass,
not doing it wrong.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,140
Am I doing it wrong?
Are you sure I'm doing it wrong?

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,270
Well,
even doing it wrong,

11
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:40,271
I forgot about the lid for people like 
been doing it wrong.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,940
It feels so right.
I'm sure someone must have used the 

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:45,940
flashlight that way.
Yeah,

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,890
I mean I've seen some giant things that 
people say like a human flesh repeat.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,900
It's like a big circle of guys,
like half of them are fucking and half 

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,650
of them are slit up another dude's ass.

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,400
A dude had his foot up a dude's ass all 
the way up to the ankle.

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,800
Is that just for shock value,
like just meet.com

19
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:04,050
or was that more like a,
I don't know,

20
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:09,070
man.
You gotta wonder what the motivation 

21
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:09,890
behind anybody wanting to take that 
picture or see that picture,

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,780
you know,
like,

23
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,450
oh,
whose,

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,840
whose medical?
Oh Fuck,

25
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,410
wait,
wait,

26
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,520
Tom,
go get the camera,

27
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:22,170
get the camera.
Does it feel good for your toes or does 

28
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,630
it feel good for his ass?
Who's happy here?

29
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,830
Who's happy in this moment?
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]

Makers of Alpha brain,

31
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,600
the cognitive enhancing supplement.
Uh,

32
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:38,290
as I say with all these nootropics and 
different things that are cognitive 

33
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,670
enhancing supplements,
do some research.

34
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:43,100
If you're interested in this stuff,
don't just buy Alpha brain.

35
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:47,120
Please go and Google nootropics and read
some articles.

36
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:48,230
It's very fascinating.

37
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,230
There's a bunch of different.
They have a bunch of proprietary blends 

38
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,870
at a bunch of other companies have that 
are great as well.

39
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:55,820
You know,
just go look and try some stuff out,

40
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,750
read some things on it.
Some things will react well with you.

41
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:02,780
Somethings won't if you like a Alpha 
brain,

42
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:05,030
but you think it's too expensive.
This is what I want you to do.

43
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:07,640
I want you to go to the ingredients list
and copy it,

44
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,850
shows you the exact dose,
copy it by the shit and bulk and put it 

45
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:12,980
together yourself.
And here's the thing.

46
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:15,420
If you buy it and it doesn't work and 
you don't like it,

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,550
it's 100 percent money back guarantee.
We try to make this as easy as possible.

48
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:24,551
There's no other way to make it as clear
as possible that I am much more 

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,620
concerned with you not feeling ripped 
off than I am with making money.

50
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,410
So I think it's a real product.
I like it.

51
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:34,880
I enjoy it.
It's good.

52
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,220
It works for me.
Alpha brain gives me like,

53
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,790
like a nice little peppy feeling.
Um,

54
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,080
I don't know what the fuck's going on 
with it.

55
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:47,081
I don't know what it does,
but that stuff's a lot of people from 

56
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:47,081
taking from taking drugs.
Well,

57
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:48,580
some people like to like,
well it might not work.

58
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,690
I'm going to be out $400 or whatever it 
is.

59
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,980
And I'm like,
I don't want to take a chance on 

60
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,080
something.
Might not work if I get some guarantee 

61
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,080
that'd be,
that'd be pretty good.

62
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,080
We like drugs.
You mean?

63
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,370
What do you mean?
Like any sort of like,

64
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,130
I don't know,
enhancers or like,

65
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,290
or like whatever you need for whatever 
else.

66
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,700
I don't know.
What drugs do people take a while?

67
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,490
This is nothing like a drug though.

68
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,540
None of these things.
I mean,

69
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,960
the only thing that would be close is 
the new mood,

70
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:13,300
the five htp supplement,
which is like a serotonin booster.

71
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,540
But even that it would be like the 
subtlest of smiles that permeates your 

72
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:18,700
brain,
you know?

73
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:21,430
Have you ever used five htp?
Didn't do much for me.

74
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,150
Didn't do we,
you taking the Neal Brennan size doses?

75
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,860
Uh,
I was taking a lot.

76
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:28,090
I thought.
Yeah.

77
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:33,091
He said he just goes over the he 
whatever the fucking recommended da is 

78
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:35,470
he.
Jack said and he just goes nuts.

79
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,340
Yeah.
But,

80
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,230
uh,
well I thought it was really fascinating

81
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:42,210
that he said that his doctor who had him
on some sort of an antidepressant,

82
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,250
she told him to get off the five htp 
because it was essentially like taking 

83
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,481
to antidepressants.
There's something where it can react 

84
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:51,481
really badly with ssrs.
Yeah.

85
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,570
Um,
but that's like happened.

86
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,600
Hundred precedence of that are Ssri,
but it can,

87
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,030
it can cause you some weird overdose.
What is the SSRI?

88
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:03,031
What is the actual name for that?
It's like serotonin something 

89
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:07,120
reinhibitor ads or delete serotonin.
Well,

90
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,620
um,
I've heard,

91
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:09,580
uh,
there's also Brian,

92
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:12,370
you read something about the dangers of 
five htp online,

93
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,690
right?
What the fuck was that about?

94
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,750
Somebody sent me this because of 
yesterday's podcast where I've been 

95
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,541
talking about my arm,
which we've talked to the doctor and he 

96
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:22,541
said it's probably from podcasting.
Okay.

97
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:22,660
Practicing.

98
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,950
And then he made that song all about how
weak I was.

99
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,860
I know he,
there was a,

100
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,130
hold on,
get to it.

101
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,300
It,
there was somebody set that on a web md 

102
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,110
that five htp might be unsafe and not to
take it because people who.

103
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,440
There's been reports that people who are
taking it are getting a serious 

104
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,261
condition with extreme muscle tenderness
called Myalgia and blood abnorm nor 

105
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:54,760
modalities.
One of those words.

106
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,190
And uh,
and so,

107
00:04:59,191 --> 00:04:59,430
uh,

108
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,760
said that you shouldn't take it into 
thinking it's a contaminant.

109
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,350
And and some five htp products and that,
um,

110
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,210
oh.
So it's not five htp,

111
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:13,211
it's something that's contaminated.
So it pretty much starts like sour milk 

112
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:15,100
going around.
Oh Wow.

113
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:17,240
So this is our month is giving people 
muscle soreness,

114
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,120
muscle soreness out of nowhere.
And we're to,

115
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,670
we'll get to the bottom of that.
I'll find out what the fuck that is.

116
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,590
So if that's the case,
you know,

117
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,740
pay attention to that folks obviously 
don't by chefs in Mexico I've already 

118
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,400
talked to,
I've already talked about a mile and 

119
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,400
five ht little too cheap.
Looking through it.

120
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Yeah.
I've already talked to Aubrey about it,

121
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:34,480
about it

122
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,990
from a on it labs and he says not to 
worry about it,

123
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,620
that,
that they test it like three times their

124
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,570
own labs.
Test it like three times to make sure,

125
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,920
you know,
that's all good.

126
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:47,560
But he said he just,
he'll look into it more,

127
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:49,700
but that's what he,
that's what he.

128
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,580
So it's some cheap company.
Yeah.

129
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:53,040
It's like cheap company,
five htp,

130
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,190
you know,
like when you're at the store,

131
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,530
like you're at the cvs and you see like,
oh there's this one for $2,

132
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:57,950
you know,
and

133
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,540
you know,
that's good to know.

134
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,660
Okay.
We also have on this list,

135
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,640
alphabet doesn't have that.
Anyway,

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,700
this is a new mood which is the five htp
tryptophan supplement.

137
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,420
I like it.
I've been taking it.

138
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,560
But yeah,
I would,

139
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,770
I would definitely consider looking into
what the,

140
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,790
whatever the fuck that's our role is 
about because that's

141
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,230
in my honest opinion,
I think the doctors,

142
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,410
right?
Like in my honest,

143
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,720
I mean somebody just said that to me and
that's why obviously you're moving your 

144
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,600
arm and it's like the vector raptor 
because I have to kind of.

145
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,730
It's almost,
what's that shit called?

146
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,580
Barbers get a lot from carpal tunnel.
Carpal tunnel.

147
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:38,600
It's almost never.
Also secretary is get a lot.

148
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,240
What else?
What other woman were like?

149
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,380
Podcasting,
too much don't to take days off.

150
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,070
Man.
Icer,

151
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,990
icer elbow.
That's ridiculous.

152
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:53,300
You're falling apart.
Falling apart.

153
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,400
Crazy.
Anyway.

154
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:56,930
Well,
like we said with a one

155
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,200
on it,
if you don't like it,

156
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:01,030
don't buy it and if you,
if you're interested,

157
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,340
go look,
I'll all the other different things that

158
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:05,770
are available online,
but if you want to buy Alpha brain,

159
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:08,850
it's available on it.com,
o n n I t,

160
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,370
we also have two different mushroom 
supplements.

161
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:15,180
One's called shroom tech sport and 
that's a,

162
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,200
a one for extreme endurance exercises.
Like if you're a person who likes to do 

163
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,960
like crossfit or shit like that,
and if you do Jujitsu or you do an mma,

164
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,720
this shroom tech sport is awesome.
It's a quarter's eps,

165
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:28,420
mushroom and 12 supplement.
It's great for energy.

166
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,290
Like,
um,

167
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,370
they,
the Chinese Olympic team was the first 

168
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,781
to start using it like the nineties.
Apparently it's like a mushroom that 

169
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:37,620
enhances your body's ability to absorb 
air.

170
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,630
Really?
Yeah.

171
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,680
You were in high altitudes,
like they noticed that cattle were 

172
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,821
eating these mushrooms and then they 
were much more lively so people started 

173
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:47,821
experimenting with them.
I thought it was a mushroom pills.

174
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,000
You thought it was talking about

175
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,130
bill must have those natural mushrooms 
because silicide Oh,

176
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:53,720
that's done mushrooms.
That's dangerous.

177
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,350
I don't know.
My friends,

178
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,490
my friends taken them and I was like,
they're just great man.

179
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,070
You don't get the upset stomach.
No.

180
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,070
Everything else was saying it's like thc
pills,

181
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,210
but it feel like then you're not working
for it as part of the mushroom 

182
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:06,210
experiences.
If you're going to get the dry,

183
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:06,210
the gifts,

184
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,040
you can eat that shitty body of it.
I'd have to try it.

185
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,650
I don't know where it gets them.
This is nothing like that.

186
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,280
This is just for endurance and there's 
another one for immune scald.

187
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,130
Trim Tech Immune,
which is a great one.

188
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,040
It's a really interesting way it works 
is we explain.

189
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,470
Explained to me is there's this mushroom
and when your body detects it,

190
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:25,730
your body thinks that it's some sort of.
It might be a bug,

191
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,200
like might be a cold or something like 
that,

192
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,470
so your immune system fires up for a 
fight that never comes.

193
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,180
Really?
Yeah.

194
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:36,190
So this mushroom somewhere,
now that tricks your body into thinking 

195
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,921
it's going to be attacked,
but nothing happens and so your immune 

196
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:38,921
system fights,
it,

197
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:43,660
pumps up,
it pumps up for a fight and there's no 

198
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,031
fight.
So it really helps your immune system 

199
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:46,031
ward off colds quicker.
Yeah,

200
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,110
it's.
I believe in.

201
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,380
I think here's something to look into to
folks is probiotics I think are very 

202
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,650
important.
Something that a lot of people

203
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,320
know.
Probiotics are live cultures.

204
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,190
It's like acidophilus or Kombucha is my 
favorite.

205
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:04,920
I drink that Kombucha Shit.
A drink that tea every day.

206
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,350
I really firmly believe it keeps you 
from getting sick.

207
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,870
Oxidants,
antioxidants.

208
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,830
Yeah.
Yeah,

209
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,840
they are.
This is a little different though.

210
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,140
This is a live culture.
Live culture is actually living things.

211
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:19,740
It's an organism you're taking into your
body that actually fights off bad shit.

212
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,510
It's kind of crazy,
but it works.

213
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,990
This organism works symbiotically with 
your body.

214
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,440
Does I don't know mushrooms or is that 
just like,

215
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,220
no,
no,

216
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:27,180
no.
It's different.

217
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,210
You know,
some of them will fucking kill you and 

218
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:32,210
there's mushrooms.
You fuck up and eat the wrong ones.

219
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,901
You'll have instant liver failure,
like there's some serious failure 

220
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:37,350
mushrooms out there and somebody had to 
find that out,

221
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:42,351
man.
Somebody had to eat those things and 

222
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:44,841
then they had like everybody stand and 
watch them and then 20 minutes later 

223
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:47,760
he's fucking black skinned and foaming 
at the mouth and his whole body spasming

224
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,510
and you're like,
okay,

225
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:51,960
now we know that mushroom is bad,
don't fucking eat that.

226
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,050
And they had to know this by the way,
back when there was no books.

227
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,270
No,
write it down.

228
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,340
You remember how honeysuckles we're okay
to eat.

229
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:02,030
But that other barrier weren't what?
Remember honeysuckles.

230
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,540
Oh yeah.
No,

231
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:07,860
I don't pull the tick them off.
I was looking for them recently.

232
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:09,480
Was the one drop of honey.
Really?

233
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,300
Yeah.
I've been actually looking for.

234
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,370
They don't have those out here in Los 
Angeles today because I thought I saw 

235
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,071
one the other day and I'm like,
but I didn't actually got it and see if 

236
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:19,071
it was one.
I think they have them somewhere,

237
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:19,380
but don a lot.
Definitely.

238
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,080
I miss those other great when you're 
biking around,

239
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,590
but you just knew which ones were fine 
with the kinkiness o n n I t.com,

240
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,990
and enter in the code name.
Rogan get 10 percent off.

241
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,470
That's it.
That's the commercial boom Orisha fears 

242
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,470
here.
Started the program,

243
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:44,230
Joe Rogan podcast,
revolutionizing commercials,

244
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,390
trying to get a smuggler for

245
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,510
Renzi.
Can Rip Missouri for showing.

246
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,420
First I was like,
I'll find.

247
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:57,421
Oh Wow.
And it was one all my favorites if you 

248
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,230
guys want to take part in this.
But then somebody was like,

249
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:01,290
why don't you just pick them?
They're all over really.

250
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,690
And I realized like I trust my drug 
dealer over what we find in nature.

251
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,880
I had a guy came up to me after a show.
It's one of the creepiest dudes ever.

252
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:10,720
It's just sweaty and weird and shit.
And he gave me a bag of mushrooms.

253
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,220
He man,
I picked these myself.

254
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,130
Like,
fuck,

255
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,760
I would fucking take your mushrooms 
crazy face,

256
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,280
but you pick yourself up.
But who you trust the regular drug.

257
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,680
It's a weird looking dude and well,
you know,

258
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:25,000
you trust,
you trust people who know people who are

259
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,330
growing them.
You,

260
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,610
you got to get into the Matrix of the 
where to get the mushrooms.

261
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:32,260
That's a problem.
The other ones are super poisoned.

262
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,290
I don't know.
You know,

263
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,390
I don't know how much difference 
silicide mushrooms look than any other 

264
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:40,390
mushrooms.
You know,

265
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,490
by the time I get them,
they're all dried out and we'll just 

266
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:44,500
take care of them.
I've never seen one.

267
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:47,110
I don't think out in the wild.
I've never seen that red top.

268
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,740
Oh,
I've seen that man that was on my 

269
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:52,740
property in Colorado.
So did you take that?

270
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:52,990
No,
I didn't.

271
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,130
I just took pictures

272
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,740
of it.
That's.

273
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,190
That was a red top of the dot with the,
with the spots with the whites.

274
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,640
Mario brother.
Ones the emoney to Ms Dot Darian.

275
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,840
Yeah.
That's the one that.

276
00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:03,340
Isn't that the Marco Alegra?
Well,

277
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:08,341
no.
See that's why that's a very funky 

278
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:08,341
mushroom.
It's a really different mushroom.

279
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:08,830
It's not.
It doesn't have silicide been in it.

280
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,870
It works in a completely different way 
with your body.

281
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:16,210
It's a psychedelic,
but it's completely different and it's 

282
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:16,900
seasonable.
It's variable genetically.

283
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:20,740
It's variable from different climates.
What we're getting in America,

284
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,940
I don't believe is the same am miscarry 
a mushroom.

285
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,950
There's a been a lot of debate on this 
amongst all those psychedelic kind of 

286
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,381
sewers.
Those people was terrence Mckenna type 

287
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:33,381
fellows.
And um,

288
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:37,750
that's one of the reasons why a lot of 
people have taken it and it doesn't do 

289
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,650
anything.
I took it once and it didn't do shit.

290
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,830
I took it with Doug Stanhope.
Maybe not.

291
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:42,550
I don't know,
man.

292
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:43,750
Yon made it.
So,

293
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:45,670
you know,
John's a fucking.

294
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,300
He's a,
he's a real head.

295
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,110
He's,
yeah,

296
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,220
he would.
And he did the,

297
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,900
he did the right thing.
He did it all right.

298
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:56,170
But it just wasn't getting us.
But then was it when you had,

299
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,780
did you eat anytime near that time that 
you took it?

300
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,370
That exactly.
No,

301
00:12:59,371 --> 00:12:59,810
no,
no.

302
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,140
We did it the right way.
We did it the right way,

303
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,980
but then,
uh,

304
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,020
we,
we mixed it with psilocybin mushrooms 

305
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,680
dug through and some syllabi assignment.
Then we went to the fucking center of 

306
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,730
the universe.
It's like mixing them together was a,

307
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,460
was a wow.
It was a total mind fuck.

308
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,000
And you know,
that was a,

309
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,020
one of the things that they believe is a
Soma Soma is,

310
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:27,471
was some sort of a mixture and it's 
talked about with great reverence and 

311
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:27,471
you know,
the,

312
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:29,950
the,
the Hindu texts and Soma is greater than

313
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:32,370
Brahma,
greater than the bill so much.

314
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,820
No,
no,

315
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:33,060
no,
no,

316
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:33,670
no,
no,

317
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,530
that's just.
They just stole the word.

318
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,360
Soma is like the greatest psychedelic 
ever apparently.

319
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,930
So what does that.
They don't know.

320
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,780
That's the craziest thing about it.
It's written with so much love,

321
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:47,740
but somehow somewhere they lost the 
formula and nobody knows what it is.

322
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,040
So it's all debated.
Like Gordon Wasson thought it was 

323
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,040
dominated with scary,
uh,

324
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,320
Mckenna.
I thought it was siliciden.

325
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,430
They think it might be a common atory 
drug with psilocybin mixed in with some 

326
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,181
other stuff and some people think it 
might be psilocybin and Amany to 

327
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:03,181
miscarry or they don't want to 
miscarriage.

328
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:04,530
How does that hit you or what does that 
do for you?

329
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,460
Well,
it depends on where you get it.

330
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:07,210
See,
everybody's getting,

331
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,100
like I said,
if I don't,

332
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:12,730
I can't speak from personal experience 
because what I got didn't really work.

333
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,820
I don't think it's hard to tell because 
it was like a few hours and it really 

334
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,750
hadn't changed.

335
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,630
But without Psilocybin,
I don't know.

336
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,920
It's supposed to.
Yeah,

337
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,650
it's supposed to be able to,
but I don't know what form.

338
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,570
I don't know what part of the world you 
got to get it.

339
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:30,160
It's variable.
That's the,

340
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,530
that's the issue with it.
It's not always psychedelic,

341
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,190
but what it is is Santa Claus,
the fucking,

342
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,680
the image of Santa Claus being this red 
and white guy,

343
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,890
you know,
the image of the trees underneath the,

344
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:42,970
um,
the pine,

345
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,960
the,
excuse me,

346
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:46,660
the presence underneath the pine cones 
are the pine trees.

347
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:51,830
They,
it has a microrisal relationship with 

348
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:51,830
birch trees.
I mean,

349
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,040
it literally grows under these

350
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,190
fucking Christmas trees.
That's where it grows.

351
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:55,880
But wrapped in shiny colors.
Yeah,

352
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,940
it's beautiful.
It's shiny as fuck Eddie Griffin 

353
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:00,940
conspiracy theory.
It does,

354
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,120
but it really,
that's really what it is.

355
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:07,121
I mean,
the whole Christmas presents under the 

356
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:08,810
tree thing is directly related to this 
Amanita to miscarry mushroom.

357
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,960
It is red and white and the way they 
drive these mushrooms out,

358
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,330
by the way,
as they hang them over the fireplace.

359
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,900
That's why people have red and white 
stockings hanging over their fireplace.

360
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,510
Why the fuck else out to dry them out.
Nice.

361
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,590
Yeah.
That's what it is,

362
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:23,900
so that it's become this stocking.
Now.

363
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,990
What would it used to be his red and 
white mushrooms hanging underneath your 

364
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,450
fireplace?
Where's the proof of that?

365
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,070
So a lot of poop.
A lot of proof.

366
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,480
There's not only that,
all the old,

367
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,060
the old,
if you go back to all the old Christmas 

368
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,060
cards,
they all have mushrooms in them.

369
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,060
Mushrooms,
symbology,

370
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,360
big emanate a mushroom in.
They have Christmas.

371
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,920
All the old Christmas cards at 
Christmas.

372
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,210
They know more than the elves are.
What you see when you take mushrooms,

373
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,880
if you take enough and then on top of 
it,

374
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,640
the elves are always playing with 
mushrooms.

375
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,550
They always have this Aminay to miscarry
a mushroom and Santa Claus.

376
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,540
It's all.
Yeah.

377
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,010
If you go back and look like,
wait,

378
00:15:58,011 --> 00:15:59,600
hold on.
I thought cola made up Santa Claus.

379
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,690
No,
no,

380
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:01,370
no,
no.

381
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,920
When it comes to color,
no,

382
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:09,020
that was,
it was claimed.

383
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:13,220
But then proof became proof that there 
was an artist from a,

384
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:14,330
at least I believe,
uh,

385
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,500
a decade or two before that who was 
attributed to making Santa Claus Red and

386
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:23,501
white.
They thought that Santa Claus was one 

387
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:23,501
color and then it was made red and white
because of,

388
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:28,331
um,
because of Coca Cola cocreated the 

389
00:16:28,331 --> 00:16:30,110
black.
It just created the black one.

390
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,290
I'm going to find some pictures for you.
And it was like groove it,

391
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,950
some Coca Cola Santa.
And so it was always had mushrooms stuff

392
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:41,951
in it.
And then Christmas time that have grown 

393
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:41,951
in that time.
Um,

394
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:44,360
see I,
I look at this one over here.

395
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:45,680
Come on over here.
Look at this.

396
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,800
All these Christmas things.
Look at that.

397
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,720
And every single person that drew every 
single one of those lived in California.

398
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,250
I do.
Dude,

399
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,850
you were retarded.
This is the oldest.

400
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:57,670
Fuck.
These are from the 17 hundreds.

401
00:16:57,671 --> 00:16:58,910
Dude.
Okay.

402
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,050
Look,
this is old as fuck.

403
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:02,740
See this Chris Christmas look emanated.
Ms Dot mushroom.

404
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,270
That's a really old picture dude.
Okay.

405
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:06,230
There's,
there's a bunch of them.

406
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,260
Look at them.
This is like all this from a long time 

407
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,841
ago.
That was the norm a long time ago in 

408
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:14,030
Europe especially,
there was the norm given that website as

409
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,290
well.

410
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,210
Just just this is what I want you to 
Google.

411
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,670
Just Google Santa and Anita miscarry a,
m u s immature,

412
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:29,050
but you look at the identity.
If you go to like say I don't know what 

413
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,361
Christmas was born.
It seems like it was born in Germany or 

414
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:34,331
something,
but if you go to Germany to Germany and 

415
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:38,100
look at and try to find artwork of the 
same Christmas stuff like in Germany 

416
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,920
from that time period and I bet none of 
them had mushrooms on.

417
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:44,080
They all had like,
you know,

418
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,720
you're just,
you're just guessing this off the top.

419
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,220
No,
no,

420
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:47,940
no.
I'm just saying,

421
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,110
you know,
I'm just saying that,

422
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,140
but that's what I would think you would 
think wrong because I'm showing you 

423
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,351
pictures of Christmas cards from 
hundreds and have all these initiatives 

424
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:57,840
that we're looking at.
Wacky Christmas card.

425
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:58,290
No,
no,

426
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:58,860
no,
it's fine.

427
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,670
There's a lot of issues.

428
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,400
Look at this one right in the search.
We'll get this one right here with this.

429
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:07,401
Uh,
there's an old picture of Santa's and 

430
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:07,401
he's got all these fucking laminated 
miscarry and mushrooms at his feet.

431
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,970
Oh fuck man.
Let me find out old as fuck.

432
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,620
Officially.
Oldest.

433
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:18,621
Fuck.
I'll find out the agents of the 

434
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:18,621
pictures.
But these,

435
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:18,980
these are,
you know,

436
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,330
these are like ancient fucking Christmas
card.

437
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,930
I see Santa Claus.
Why would you not see it?

438
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,490
I don't know.
It just like,

439
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,790
why is this not talked about all the 
time?

440
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,630
Then,
you know,

441
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:33,190
like why?
Why is this not on regular TV news?

442
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,270
I feel like the Tower,
seven of holidays,

443
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,790
posture muscles are just in it for like,
there's so many correlations.

444
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,080
Listen,
listen to the connection.

445
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,120
So the,
the way they drive these fucking things 

446
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,120
out is twofold.
One,

447
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,640
they hang them on the trees,
they put them in the branches.

448
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,560
So they drive by the sun,
or b,

449
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,140
they hang them under the fireplace.
What do they do?

450
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,800
You see fucking stockings.
Hang on the train,

451
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:05,770
you know,
it's probably literally grow under the 

452
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,661
same tree that we use as a Christmas 
tree and they are shiny packages and if 

453
00:19:08,661 --> 00:19:13,521
you get them from the right place,
apparently they make you trip the fuck 

454
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:15,420
out and then their response,
that's the mushroom that they believe is

455
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,130
responsible for the,
you know the,

456
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,010
the writings in the Bible.
It's the sacred mushroom in the cross.

457
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,040
The laminated must carry mushroom is on 
the cover of the sacred mushroom and the

458
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:28,041
cross.
It just makes sense to me that if 

459
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,051
scholars believe that there's a 
connection between this mushroom and 

460
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:33,621
religious texts,
then of course there was a connection 

461
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:36,651
between this mushroom and Santa Claus 
and if you add up all the things that 

462
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:39,030
line up as far as like hanging over the 
fireplace and putting it on trees,

463
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,410
it totally could be possible.

464
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,300
So is if you go to the encyclopedia 
Britannica headquarters in wherever that

465
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:50,301
would be,
like Wisconsin and you go through them 

466
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:50,301
and go,
all right,

467
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,500
what is this Christmas to you?
What do you guys have about the mushroom

468
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,120
thing that they're like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

469
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:54,890
Get it out of here,
hippie.

470
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,860
You know,
don't,

471
00:19:55,861 --> 00:20:00,861
wouldn't you think that they're not that
willing to it to incorporate any sort of

472
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,390
illegal drug ideology into their,
their,

473
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,650
their work?
They probably just would ignore it even 

474
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,931
if there's a lot of evidence.
So you think sometimes that people that 

475
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:14,511
do a lot of mushrooms try to make 
connections with everything and 

476
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:16,890
definitely they do.
That's what my judge.

477
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,570
If I had to judge,
like if this was a game,

478
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:19,950
she said that's what my judgment would 
be like.

479
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:24,951
Yeah.
That's just some hippie that made this 

480
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:25,770
awesome connection.
It's a great story and that's what.

481
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:26,640
No,
that's what I'm thinking.

482
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,620
Okay.
Well that's a dumb way to think why.

483
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,730
Because scholars,
I'm not sold on anything.

484
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:38,060
I'm not sold that thing,
but I'm definitely not sold on you just 

485
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,060
talking off your ass.
No,

486
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,791
I'm just putting a counterpoint.
The counterpoint to a fucking guy who 

487
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:42,480
was a scholar.
John,

488
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:45,390
Marco Allegro studied the Tennessee 
scholars that say the exact,

489
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,400
not the only ones that do are religious 
ones.

490
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,170
I know,
but.

491
00:20:49,171 --> 00:20:50,640
But who says that?
Religious.

492
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,160
He was an encyclopedia Britannica.
We're not talking about soccer,

493
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:01,330
but I'm just saying that going about the
Dead Sea scrolls wouldn't even been 

494
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,280
encyclopedic.
Couldn't it be a part of the part of the

495
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,750
Christmas originally Pagan holiday and 
there's going to be part of that Pagan 

496
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,960
holiday.
Worse.

497
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,180
That ritual should definitely go over 
that.

498
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,740
They use those guys.
It's just the.

499
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,740
The.
The real question is what's the elves?

500
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,320
What's with the fucking mushrooms and 
all these Christmas pictures.

501
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,800
What's with the correlations?
Why do these mushrooms exist?

502
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:26,030
You know,
in why do they coincide with this 

503
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,030
holiday?
What is the big deal?

504
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,680
But the big deal is these people were 
tripping their fucking balls off.

505
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:28,000
Man.
That's what it is.

506
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,760
And it became somehow or another,
it gets turned into a,

507
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,580
a guy coming down the chimney and given 
you presence.

508
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:39,060
What it was is this was.
This is some shit they found under the 

509
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,731
tree.
That's much more likely to me if you've 

510
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:43,701
got to fucking plant that makes you trip
balls and an ancient people find out 

511
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:44,620
about it.
They worshiped that shit.

512
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,860
You know?
It becomes like a huge part of their 

513
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,051
life.
Could you imagine if your world was the 

514
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:52,900
regular world of people that live before
books?

515
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,450
You know,
I mean you're barely civilized.

516
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,890
Barely got it together.
People just getting by everyday big gets

517
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:01,420
sick.
Nobody know what the fuck was going on.

518
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,520
There was no doctors.
We just died,

519
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:06,190
man.
You just gave you some leaves to chew on

520
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:09,490
and usually just fucking died.
What if they found something like this?

521
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,310
If they found that there was some 
mushrooms and you would eat them and all

522
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:17,311
of a sudden you'd be lying in a field 
and fucking spiraling through the 

523
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,640
universe and the most wild ride of,
of,

524
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,260
of,
of joy and ecstasy of your life,

525
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,050
and then he would.

526
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,710
You would want to fucking praise that 
shit.

527
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,000
You would want them to make that.
Yeah.

528
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,960
You would want to create a holiday.
You'd want to make it a part of your,

529
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,000
your,
your everyday life.

530
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,570
You would be worshiping it,
you know,

531
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:41,571
that's,
that's the feeling behind a lot of 

532
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:42,040
people with why there was all this 
cattle worship in the ancient world,

533
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,500
you know,
because no one can understand that.

534
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:45,820
Like why?
Why would you have these?

535
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,410
Like really aggressive primates.
They did worship cats.

536
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:55,411
Yeah.
But they didn't worship him like people 

537
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:55,411
were like,
the Hindus worship the cows.

538
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:57,460
Cows are cows.
They just leave them alone.

539
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,040
No Man eat it.
Don't eat them.

540
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:03,550
They consider them sacred.
They consider them a site.

541
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,600
I don't,
I don't know.

542
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,490
Something,
something cool.

543
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:11,491
They consider them something cool.
But I think that has to do with the 

544
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,270
media says about it.
And my mushrooms growing in the cow shit

545
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,840
is what we competed has about it.
About what Christmas is the relation for

546
00:23:17,841 --> 00:23:19,300
mushrooms to um,
Santa Claus.

547
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,930
Okay.
Um,

548
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,440
flyer,
Garrick's peer.

549
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,330
I don't know what flight algorithms are.
Garrick's.

550
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,690
That's the,
the actual plant.

551
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:26,350
So,
okay.

552
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:31,390
Up here on Christmas cards and New 
Year's cards from around the world as a 

553
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,470
symbol of good luck.
The ethno botanists.

554
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:37,471
Jonathan suggested the idea of Santa 
Claus and tradition of hang stockings 

555
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:37,990
over the fireplace.
They essentially,

556
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:42,991
upon this mushroom itself,
there's a lot of people that have had 

557
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:44,290
proposed in the red and white color 
scheme.

558
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:49,291
You know,
it's a Santa Claus related to the 

559
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:49,291
mushroom.

560
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:49,291
He also draws on parallels with flying 
reindeer.

561
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:54,120
Randy had been reported to consume the 
mushroom and prance around in an 

562
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,470
intoxicated manner afterwards.
No wild.

563
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,480
That's what what's up,
but flying reindeer,

564
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,080
reindeer,
love emoney to miscarry mushrooms so 

565
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,080
much,
and when people have these mushrooms and

566
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,660
they trip out the people,
yeah,

567
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,570
they do well when people will.
The other thing about Avalina Mascara,

568
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,600
mushrooms is about recycling the urine.
The way to really trip your balls off is

569
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,500
apparently a lot of whatever it is that 
psychoactive inside the mushroom is.

570
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,680
It passes through your body and into 
your urine and if you drink your urine 

571
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,790
kicks the whole experience to the next 
level.

572
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,640
What do you mean while you're on it?
While you're tripping balls,

573
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,600
you're going to go deep,
deep,

574
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:34,601
deep.
The guy who told me who did it said it 

575
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:34,601
was.
It was crazy.

576
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:35,180
It was like he was tripping and 
everybody's like,

577
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:36,160
okay,
if you have to pay,

578
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,760
you got to drink your pee,
and he's like,

579
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:42,761
fuck man,
I want to drink my pm already tripping 

580
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:42,761
balls.

581
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:42,761
This is good,
this is good.

582
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:46,520
And he drank his penis like through yet 
psilocybin mushrooms.

583
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,700
That's the case and we need to miscarry 
mushrooms.

584
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,690
I'd be like,
dude,

585
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:55,691
don't trust her.
This is just the mushrooms talking to 

586
00:24:55,691 --> 00:24:55,890
not know that.
So the Shaman talking.

587
00:24:55,891 --> 00:24:57,890
That's like the the ancient tradition of
doing it.

588
00:24:57,891 --> 00:25:00,950
If that's how you take it to the next 
level while you're in the middle of your

589
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:04,070
mushroom experience,
he'd drink your urine and whatever it is

590
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,730
still listen,
the Psilocybin,

591
00:25:05,731 --> 00:25:06,830
whatever it is,
it's passed through.

592
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:08,780
I don't know that the technical 
components of it,

593
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:12,580
but apparently talking to several people
who've done this but this guy says,

594
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,970
is that if Santa Claus had one eye or if
magic urine to be part of his legend,

595
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,820
it'd be way easier to believe,
but it's.

596
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,920
That's why it's not.
That's why there's dispute because like 

597
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:23,920
it's not super clear.

598
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,110
Well,
yeah.

599
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,530
Who the fuck knows?
I think it's possible that there was an 

600
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,631
article about in the magazine Sunday,
Sunday Times in 1980 and the new 

601
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:33,200
scientist and intensity to six.
So those are,

602
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,740
those are legitimate.
Yeah,

603
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,140
well it's not,
you know,

604
00:25:36,141 --> 00:25:41,141
this is not my wacky idea.
This is an idea that's been kicked 

605
00:25:41,141 --> 00:25:41,141
around for decades.
People believe it,

606
00:25:41,141 --> 00:25:41,930
that are,
uh,

607
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:47,140
you know,
like they're serious scholars that 

608
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,050
believe in this silly idea.
But uh,

609
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:53,350
the um,
the whole idea of it being illegal is 

610
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,660
what's the most fascinating thing to me,
you know,

611
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,870
these mushrooms real legal,
that this is a,

612
00:25:56,871 --> 00:26:01,871
this is somehow or another,
some person has decided to pass some 

613
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:02,840
sort of a law saying that you can't 
experience this.

614
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,200
That's bad for it.
I was walking out of a pot store once,

615
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,450
early on at Zen.
I was like,

616
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,540
I still felt like it's like cool that 
I'm having drugs and I still the cop on 

617
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:13,540
the corner,
I was like,

618
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:13,540
doesn't matter.

619
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,020
I'm holding my truck.
And I realized my other hand,

620
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:16,070
I had a bag of mushrooms.
I was like,

621
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,790
oh,
this I got to try not to be so weird.

622
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,420
You'd fucking Dork walking under this 
tree with mushrooms in your hand.

623
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,450
Wow.
You just live in that crazy comedy 

624
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:28,450
lifeson.
Yeah,

625
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,810
you get it.
They don't care in la,

626
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,230
but I hope it stays this way.
You know,

627
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,750
it's the real issue is the federal 
issue.

628
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,080
You know,
if we could find one cool spot and if 

629
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,080
they,
you know,

630
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,931
supported states rights,
we could find a cool spot where we can 

631
00:26:43,931 --> 00:26:44,220
make pretty much everything legal.
We all got together

632
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,670
and said,
hey,

633
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:48,500
we're gonna have one.
Clarity state is a state where murders,

634
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,490
murder,
crime theft,

635
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:51,240
all that stuff.
Yeah.

636
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:53,430
That's all illegal.
Arson.

637
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,220
Silly.
Yeah.

638
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,950
The rest of it shut up and the rest of 
it just shut the fuck up.

639
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,050
There's too many God damn laws.
This is.

640
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:06,051
This is how it's going to go down.
This is where the money's going to go 

641
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:08,241
here.
This is going to be legal and this will 

642
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:08,241
be regulated.
This,

643
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:11,280
you know,
you have to buy in the store will then 

644
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,430
you'll know it's pure and it's tested by
the government.

645
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:13,560
That's where the government can help out
test mushrooms.

646
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,030
That's what you want.
You want to help out,

647
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:17,460
you want to really be of service to the 
people.

648
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,700
This is what we do.
We get rid of some of the government job

649
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:20,610
at John Hopkins Study,
right?

650
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:23,670
And we bring the John Hopkins Study said
that people taking mushrooms,

651
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,630
even just one experience significantly 
affected them for decades,

652
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,900
significantly affected their 
personality,

653
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,900
change it for the better.

654
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,400
I've,
I know psychedelic experience has 

655
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,361
changed me.
I know every time I take them when I 

656
00:27:38,361 --> 00:27:40,980
have like thoughts of what I need to do 
right or what I'm doing wrong or what's,

657
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,250
what's fucking with me or that's.
Those are just jolts of reality that you

658
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:50,400
don't get unless you take a psychedelic.
You can,

659
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,840
you can get,
you can get,

660
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:56,130
like when you meditate outside you 
really easily.

661
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,410
You could get pretty deep when you're 
meditating.

662
00:27:58,411 --> 00:27:59,880
I'm not above,
uh,

663
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,910
the idea that some people can get to 
psychedelic states naturally because 

664
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,580
it's been written about by so many 
people.

665
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:07,650
I think it's a discipline issue.
I think it's just like,

666
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,750
like you could tell someone,
hey,

667
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:10,500
uh,
you know,

668
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,940
I could teach you martial arts and uh,
you could go and kick somebody's ass and

669
00:28:14,941 --> 00:28:19,941
then you're like really short and then I
give you like one lesson and throw you 

670
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:21,750
in there and the guy like Marcella 
Garcia and you just get manhandled.

671
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,820
Like,
I could never fucking do this because I 

672
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,361
don't think it's a one.
I don't think a lot of people that 

673
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:32,210
would.
What you think is possible due to 

674
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:32,310
meditation is based on your level of 
meditation.

675
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,170
How,
how deep have you taken it?

676
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,660
You know what I mean?
How relaxed do you get?

677
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,180
How centered do you get when you 
meditate?

678
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:42,930
Because some people get super distracted
and it never gets more than A.

679
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,730
Yeah.
It never gets more than a surface.

680
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,790
Sort of like a relaxation real deep.
With mushrooms I take a little bit like 

681
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,040
see,
like the universal truths sort of hold 

682
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,070
onto it barely for like a second or two 
or like a day.

683
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:58,250
But then it's like the more I go,
the more I can bring back and remember 

684
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:58,250
like,
Oh yeah,

685
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,730
this thing I gotta write all about.
You know,

686
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,100
it's always humbling.
Humbling.

687
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,120
Yeah.

688
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,650
It's like you don't matter.
You don't matter what you do.

689
00:29:05,651 --> 00:29:07,470
Once you do.
I mean you do your,

690
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:09,580
you have intent and you have,
you know,

691
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,030
will and you can spread positive energy.
You,

692
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,430
you do matter,
you matter.

693
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:19,431
But I mean,
God damn this is a lot of us know and 

694
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:21,210
we're all a part of one thing.
If we all matter,

695
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:23,400
then you matter as well.
It's not that you don't matter,

696
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:26,940
but God damn it's big.
It's fucking giant.

697
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:29,940
It's all encompassing.
It's not just your house,

698
00:29:29,941 --> 00:29:34,941
it's not just your car,
it's not just your street or your 

699
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:35,070
neighborhood.
It's the whole fucking universe.

700
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:38,250
And it's all together in one giant 
fucking soup.

701
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,980
We just can't feel it.
We just can't feel.

702
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:41,980
We feel like there's.
Well

703
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,100
there's distance between us and Mars 
does no distance.

704
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,490
Everything between this and that.
There is something there.

705
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:53,970
Whether it's dark matter or shit you 
can't see or stuff we haven't 

706
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,991
discovered.
There is nowhere where there's not 

707
00:29:57,991 --> 00:29:58,090
something,
there's no,

708
00:29:58,091 --> 00:30:03,091
even in a vacuum,
there's something if there's something 

709
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:03,630
everywhere and you know,
whether it's Subatomic,

710
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,880
whether it's we are connected to 
everything everywhere and that is 

711
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:14,881
impossible to recognize without some 
sort of a full blown psychedelic 

712
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:19,561
experience.
It takes something like that to feel it 

713
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:22,530
because otherwise it's just a bunch of 
words because I thought all those words 

714
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:22,530
before,
you know,

715
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,260
I thought all of those words like,
yeah,

716
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:28,261
you know,
it's kind of corrupting for all kind of 

717
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:28,261
connected and you know,
and I think yeah,

718
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:32,791
the universe is huge and you know,
I had all those thoughts before 

719
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:33,950
psychedelics and I had them with,
you know,

720
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,740
a certain amount of clarity.

721
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:41,190
But there's a big difference between.
I feel like it sucks you out and just 

722
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,181
makes you seem like you're just one of,
even in your state of so many people 

723
00:30:45,181 --> 00:30:49,231
that you're just like a blip and then 
you see time before you and after you 

724
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:49,231
when you're like,
oh my God.

725
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:50,110
Yeah.
It's insane.

726
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:55,410
It's insane to think that you know,
that we have this short amount of time 

727
00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:00,061
here and it seems like as the time goes 
on and you just start figuring out what 

728
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:00,870
the fuck is going on,
you know,

729
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:05,871
like as you get to that's.
That's like the thing about people 

730
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:07,180
today.
We live long enough to see the hustle.

731
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,090
We live long enough to see the bullshit.
You know,

732
00:31:10,091 --> 00:31:11,560
if we were Romans,
man,

733
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,180
we would all be long dead.
All of us were not.

734
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,360
You're in your thirties.
I'm in my forties.

735
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,610
We're dead.
People were dead.

736
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,170
There's no way we'd be alive,
totally crippled.

737
00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:25,360
We'd have lion bites on our dicks and 
shit.

738
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,480
One of us will be missing an arm or 
something.

739
00:31:28,481 --> 00:31:29,080
You know,
you,

740
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,730
you,
you get fucked up back then,

741
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:34,060
man.
But today we can live and we live safely

742
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:39,061
and we have enough nutrition and you're 
eating vitamins and everything and you 

743
00:31:39,061 --> 00:31:39,460
live long enough to see like God damn 
hustle.

744
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,240
Ten years ago they said one of two 
people in England would live to see 100.

745
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:48,470
God Damn.
Why don't you learn to live in a castle 

746
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,101
though?
Back in the day like where you had the 

747
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:51,101
little courtyards,
little houses in between like inside the

748
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:51,670
vessel,
like a,

749
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:55,750
like a really big one.
I think that would be crazy.

750
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:00,770
It gives you,
you have this one giant house and 

751
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,671
everybody around you has little houses.
That's the dumbest way to live mean 

752
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:02,671
when.
That'd be cool.

753
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,660
Just to like experience it for like 
three days or something.

754
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:09,661
Like I'd like to have all those people 
in those little houses want to kill you 

755
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:10,930
is gold.
Yeah.

756
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:15,931
I wonder if it was like that.
Imagine that if everybody else is 

757
00:32:15,931 --> 00:32:15,970
starving and there's this giant house 
with people that are eaten.

758
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:16,900
Gold sandwiches.

759
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,620
Sound like you're describing Bashar 
Assad.

760
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,400
Bashar Assad was a leader theory.
Oh really?

761
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,220
Like everyone's starting to revolt,
but it's like I stuck out the guns.

762
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,530
Oh Wow.
It's,

763
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,820
it's how crazy is that whole Arab area,
the whole Arab spring thing and what it 

764
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:36,880
does is nuts.
Man.

765
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,030
That guy,
my death pool.

766
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,530
Did you really?
Yeah.

767
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,280
It's a strange,
strange time for the whole part of the.

768
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,530
They're all the internet making 
everybody like,

769
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:45,980
wait,
what?

770
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,510
Did what over there?
Really?

771
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,120
Yeah,
well they,

772
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,220
they see that you let them have the 
Internet really,

773
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,080
and he finally like lax on the Internet 
and then they was like,

774
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:56,180
man,
it was his downfall.

775
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,440
Yeah.
That in the CIA bitch,

776
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:06,070
you know,
the CIA had a little piece of outside 

777
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,070
influence,
like you shouldn't be listening.

778
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,200
That's the spies that are starting all 
this,

779
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,340
but maybe.
Yeah,

780
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,570
that's the best way to overthrow them.

781
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,610
Get their own people to do it for us.
Yeah,

782
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,370
sure.
Arm,

783
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,530
arm armed and all we're trying to get 
them to do is just live free.

784
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,570
Yeah.
But that shit don't work that way.

785
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,900
Make the new boss same as the old boss.
That's what's going on in Iraq right 

786
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,671
now.
Iraq apparently is just a fucking mess 

787
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:30,671
right now.
Like,

788
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:34,280
yeah,
there's like a civil war about to break 

789
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,031
out.
So they always say as soon as it 

790
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:36,031
happened,
as soon as we left,

791
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:36,031
I was just kind of happen,
right?

792
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:36,031
Course,
man,

793
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:36,031
we,
we,

794
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:36,920
we,
you know,

795
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,980
there's a vacuum and when there's a 
vacuum someone's going to seek to fill 

796
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,281
it.
And there's a lot of people that are 

797
00:33:45,281 --> 00:33:45,680
still alive that were alive back during 
the Saddam era,

798
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,750
you know,
and those,

799
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,780
those people are going to try to get 
control of that bitch and then there's 

800
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,310
new people moving in and then there's 
also the idea that,

801
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:57,370
you know,
the connection between Iraq and 

802
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:01,810
Afghanistan and all of our resources and
went where the fuck is this country 

803
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:05,480
going and why do we have 100 different 
bases all over the country or the world.

804
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,480
It's like,
what are we wasting our time and our 

805
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:10,480
resources on?
Is this really necessary anymore?

806
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,321
Or is this just a bunch of people who 
have contracts and we keep giving them 

807
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:15,320
contracts because it's just what we've 
always done.

808
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:20,321
And that's how they got involved.
That's how they keep politicians in 

809
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:20,570
office.
And then we're stuck because that's.

810
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,370
It seems like what it is,
we're fucked.

811
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,820
What really said,
what I occupied Wall Street finally sat 

812
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:28,820
there.
Like the problem is if you get sponsored

813
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,320
by a big corporation,
you know,

814
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:31,730
they give you a bunch of money for your 
campaign,

815
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:37,180
they can effectively fire you by 
withholding that money that you need to 

816
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:37,340
get elected.
Again.

817
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,530
You know,
it's like good luck doing this without,

818
00:34:41,531 --> 00:34:42,610
you know,
$500,000,000

819
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:43,300
in your,
in your,

820
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:48,550
in your ad budget this year,
or how much of that is probably a lot 

821
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:48,550
more.

822
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:49,970
I don't know.

823
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,950
You need to get those bitches.
Mushrooms.

824
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,210
Yeah,
right.

825
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,070
Yeah.
That's what we need to do Christmas.

826
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:58,400
That's a good answer to a lot of things.
Getting those bitches on mushrooms,

827
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,340
I tell it to eliminate people really is 
true either.

828
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:05,350
I'm like,
when's the last time we did some 

829
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:05,350
mushrooms?
Maybe some.

830
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:05,390
It sounds like I did mushrooms.
I found something crazy.

831
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,630
Like I had a huge bag of really good 
mushrooms and I took half of them and 

832
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,530
trip my ass off hardest.
I bet you know,

833
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,490
super hard trip

834
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,840
visual.
Hang on,

835
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,310
hold on,
hold on.

836
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,360
This real quick.
I don't want you to get back to throw 

837
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,981
it.
This is where I realize everybody's 

838
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:21,981
like,
oh,

839
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:23,471
the mushrooms.
I got a super good and everybody says 

840
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:25,601
that,
but they really mean is mushrooms are 

841
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:25,601
super good.

842
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:25,601
Yeah.
Yeah.

843
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:25,601
Well,
well,

844
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:25,601
well then.
And then I,

845
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,610
you ever got bad ones?
No,

846
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:33,230
I have the first time.
The first time I took it had the 

847
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,171
greatest time.
Second time I ate like two hours before 

848
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:38,040
and was just like sitting on a couch 
watching time and

849
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,460
going,
wow,

850
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:43,461
this is all right.
But then I took more the second time it 

851
00:35:43,461 --> 00:35:47,331
was the same mushrooms and uh,
the first time I tripped my ass off 

852
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:47,520
because I didn't eat anything else the 
whole day.

853
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,040
Oh,
well it also could be,

854
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,200
you know,
I've heard of people getting mushrooms.

855
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:54,120
Actually it hurt.
You have mushrooms,

856
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:57,790
you'd set out some mold on it.
You like food poisoning it,

857
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,900
you know,
I think that's what's going to happen.

858
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:05,901
I think sometimes you get sick from 
mushrooms and that's usually because he 

859
00:36:05,901 --> 00:36:09,691
had never gotten sick from barb to the 
first time I got a billy goat stomach.

860
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,930
I couldn't eat some shit.
I'd never barked.

861
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,450
But my friend who gave it to me the 
first time used to make them,

862
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,460
her buddy was said,
you will get,

863
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,140
you'll feel nauseous,
like you're gonna throw up.

864
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,280
He's like,
you won't throw up.

865
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,110
Just sit down and look up in the air for
a while.

866
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:27,140
The feeling will pass fear factor 
completely changed my whole ability to 

867
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,371
withstand smells and,
and people vomit or you can handle 

868
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:31,371
anything.
Now I'm immune.

869
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:33,750
I'm completely immune to getting sick,
watching someone vomit,

870
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,360
you know,
because I used to get.

871
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,670
I used to physically gag if I smelled 
puke,

872
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,230
like I was a kid.
You remember?

873
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:44,490
You know what I was getting knocked baby
was no problem for me,

874
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:45,580
man.
I just sat right through.

875
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,820
The wind would shift and you catch a 
whiff of it?

876
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,750
Yeah,
it was.

877
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,200
It was horrendous baby bird.
If you don't know it was the greatest 

878
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,830
gag in the history of race.
And Ari and I were there,

879
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,800
uh,
we'll burn bill burger and a chimney.

880
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:01,350
Norton.
And what it was was there was this crazy

881
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:03,360
kid that they had working for opiod,
Anthony,

882
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,070
and his name is Pat Duffy.

883
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,120
You got to back up this.
Well,

884
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:08,790
this is.
I'm going to,

885
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,380
I'm going to explain it through this 
way.

886
00:37:10,381 --> 00:37:13,350
I'm just going to split in this kid and 
they get this kid to do anything.

887
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,720
This kid brushed his teeth with dog 
shit.

888
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,000
He was,
he was a maniac.

889
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,390
He's a fucking maniac.
I saw him drink other people's puke.

890
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,460
I saw him drink a glass full of other 
dudes.

891
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:26,490
PUKES dudes threw up.
There was some sort of eating contest.

892
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,940
There was a uh,
economic drinking contest.

893
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,510
Yeah.
But that's.

894
00:37:29,511 --> 00:37:31,290
This was a different one.
I'm talking about a different one,

895
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,500
but I've seen him,
I've seen him do some ridiculous shit 

896
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,650
before this.
So we had a bunch of their guys there 

897
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:42,600
for the egg drinking contest and pat 
from hockey is the ace in the hole.

898
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,720
He winds that bitch every year.
He's got diabetes.

899
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:46,870
He's done with.

900
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:52,010
Yeah.
So he's not supposed to be drinking 

901
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:52,350
eggnog at the first place and he's 
drinking like fucking gallons of it.

902
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:54,810
He's a big boy.
It's a double shot every 60 seconds.

903
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:00,170
And he's up to like 70,
70 glasses like chucking.

904
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,670
Oh man,
like seven,

905
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,940
eight in some people.
Some people.

906
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,290
By the way,
this is non alcoholic,

907
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,490
this just eggnog.
Um,

908
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,860
something because if he drank like 70 
shots,

909
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:12,850
he'd be a dead man.
You'd be a dead.

910
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,990
But um,
so what was your question?

911
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,610
When did people start,
start,

912
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,790
start Fokker?
Because it was the.

913
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,050
Yeah,
he got up to like 70 shots.

914
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,990
I believe it was something insane.
It was ridiculous.

915
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:29,991
And he said he was going to puke and we 
were trying to figure out what to do 

916
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:31,690
with the puke and just as a joke,
I did not think anybody would say that.

917
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:37,100
I said,
why don't you have this kid leaned his 

918
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,100
head into the,
into the,

919
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,900
the garbage pail and have pat throw up 
in his mouth.

920
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,660
I just came up with the dumbest shit 
ever because like,

921
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,260
I didn't think anybody would say yes.
And we were on edibles at the time,

922
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,850
probably put up 99 percent.
I always am if I do.

923
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,410
And Anthony,
um,

924
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:59,470
so we were high as a kite and I never 
thought anyway,

925
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,020
it was just going crazy extremes.
Yeah,

926
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:04,320
it was ridiculous.
The dude late,

927
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:09,490
he laid on his back with my,
with the garbage pail and put his,

928
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:14,580
put his body into it,
like he was going to open up a wash for 

929
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:14,980
a haircut just all the way back.
Yeah.

930
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:17,140
It was one of those big tubs.
Nice.

931
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:18,940
Good size,
garbage pail.

932
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,460
And he leans back and opens his mouth.
And this guy had from.

933
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:22,930
Oh,
knocking.

934
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,130
It's available online.
Right.

935
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:27,270
You can watch it.
Had to have the videos online.

936
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,820
One got taken down because somebody 
complained that it was disgusting.

937
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,130
But there's another one on there.
Can you find it somewhere?

938
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,600
Just find a play it.
Why can't we play it?

939
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,860
Because you don't have that technology 
at this here.

940
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

941
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,990
Okay.
Alright.

942
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,260
Um,
either way at this one.

943
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,100
That technology here.
Yeah.

944
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,070
Um,
but.

945
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:52,110
So there's this dude.
I mean you could just picture a baby 

946
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:52,270
bird.
This picture,

947
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,690
I believe there's video to the,
the amount,

948
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,770
the volumes that came out of his mouth 
enveloping the other guy who was insane.

949
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:01,780
It was the craziest thing I'd ever seen 
anybody ever do.

950
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,220
I mean,
he's hurling her holding onto this guy's

951
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:10,750
face and it's like a cartoon throw up.
It doesn't totally doesn't look real.

952
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,430
You remember a bucket of water,
the windows.

953
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,640
So much.

954
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,660
Giant man just unloading and you know 
what?

955
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:21,700
I talked to Opie and Anthony.
They said they would never be able to do

956
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:22,910
that again.
What?

957
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,130
They said,
you can't do that again.

958
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,600
Friesan trench reasons they've tightened
dangerous.

959
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,460
Fuck dangerous.
No one died.

960
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:37,470
Somebody died in Sacramento,
I believe it was in Sacramento from 

961
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,240
water.
They were drinking water.

962
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,530
Water.
See how long ago she.

963
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:46,531
She,
she died from an overdose of water 

964
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:46,750
break.com.
Is it on breakdown?

965
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,040
Oh,
beautiful.

966
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,020
Go check that out folks.
Trust me.

967
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:55,021
It's worth just sheer ridiculousness.
It's just one of the most ridiculous 

968
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:59,830
things I've ever seen a person do ever.
We were there already.

969
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,410
That was so great.
It was.

970
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,630
No,
you weren't there Brian.

971
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,690
No.
You put the videos that you were sending

972
00:41:05,691 --> 00:41:07,690
in a video.
He,

973
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,550
um,
wish you were there.

974
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,620
The barfing started like seven minutes.
People will like throw up and they were 

975
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,110
out and then more he'll start buying the
one guy barfed into some,

976
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,980
you know,
fruit loops or eating it with,

977
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,550
oh my God,
that's fucking that same kid pat off and

978
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:22,270
it just ramped up.

979
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,680
Yeah,
that's right.

980
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,280
That's right.
Because of that.

981
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,150
Oh,
that's right.

982
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:30,420
I forgot that part and it was just like,
oh,

983
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,860
thing and building so much bar from the 
air.

984
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,480
If you want to have a.
If you want to be a shock jock,

985
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,410
that kid is the greatest intern you 
could ever hope to hire.

986
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,630
I mean,
that kid's a goddamn kamikaze if he's 

987
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:44,630
still alive.
He's alive.

988
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,350
He's alive,
he's alive.

989
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:50,351
He messaged me on twitter a while back.
He kept throwing stuff and enroll in 

990
00:41:50,351 --> 00:41:50,351
space.
Yeah,

991
00:41:50,351 --> 00:41:52,310
and he would almost bar.
They kept showing it to them.

992
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,920
The fruit loops.
Disgusting is the picture.

993
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:56,410
It's the baby bird.
Oh,

994
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,150
and a do a google image search.
It's the first one that pops up.

995
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,730
Amazing photo it is to load on to show.
This is so silly.

996
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,760
It's so great.
I knew what we were starting to do that 

997
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:09,760
anymore.

998
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,040
There's massive law,
massive lawsuits,

999
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:13,870
massive,
uh,

1000
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,220
you know,
just really wouldn't be what it is.

1001
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:17,900
Basically,
you know,

1002
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:22,901
they've,
they've clamped down and they made sure 

1003
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:25,091
that there's less probability for 
getting sued and when there's less 

1004
00:42:25,091 --> 00:42:26,210
probability of getting sued,
there's also less a probability.

1005
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:29,510
Something fucking crazy happening.
Supreme Court entertainment just took on

1006
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,580
the case.
You would love those of.

1007
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,450
I'm getting rid of the FCC standards on 
network television.

1008
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,400
Really?
Yeah.

1009
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,230
They said pretty much since nine,
nine percent of people have cable.

1010
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,400
It's ridiculous.
Anyway,

1011
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:43,890
channel seven's okay.
Which it's not like why?

1012
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,180
Um,
uh,

1013
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,520
yeah.
And they're hearing it now with that.

1014
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:48,290
No,
not anymore.

1015
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,680
But I still find people,
unfortunately people are going to fight 

1016
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,140
it though.
There's a lot of like pro family,

1017
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:57,070
Pro Christian radio,
you know,

1018
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:00,220
like there'll be a program to be able to
show you if there's nudity at.

1019
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,990
I've looked at that photo,
my God,

1020
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,890
look at that photo.
Jesus Christ.

1021
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,000
You can put that picture up.
You can put that picture up in the.

1022
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,520
Oh,
is this the only way to do it here?

1023
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:14,540
No.
No.

1024
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,060
Alright.
You email it to me.

1025
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:17,590
I could do it.
Okay.

1026
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:22,700
Is that the most ridiculous shit?
It's so it looks like he's a spider,

1027
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,570
like breaking it down with his end 
science.

1028
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:27,020
Breaking down that other guy.
It looks like a cartoon.

1029
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:34,030
Anyway,
we'll talk about something before I get 

1030
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:34,030
sick.
God Damn.

1031
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:34,600
Yeah.
You can't do that anymore.

1032
00:43:34,601 --> 00:43:36,670
It's no fun.
I mean if you want to have a business,

1033
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:40,140
I mean you got to think and when you get
involved in something like serious look,

1034
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,520
gigantic fucking huge company that's 
worth hundreds of millions of dollars 

1035
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,990
for everything.
Yeah.

1036
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:50,750
Because you assholes want to drink egg?
Hey idiot face.

1037
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,060
That's the problem man.
You know,

1038
00:43:53,061 --> 00:43:57,290
Anthony Cumi is uh,
his show is now on itunes and he's got a

1039
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:59,270
video on it.
He has video on itunes.

1040
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,120
Yeah.
I tried doing that.

1041
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:00,950
I think.
I don't know,

1042
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:02,660
but.
Well he's paying for video.

1043
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:04,280
A video host.
Wow.

1044
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:08,090
But I tried to do it twice now and the 
video wouldn't play.

1045
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:11,400
His bandwidth must be fucked or 
something like that goes.

1046
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,590
Yeah,
I would imagine.

1047
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:17,591
I just did it.
I bet he probably doesn't realize how 

1048
00:44:17,591 --> 00:44:18,110
much money is going to have bandwidth.
What people don't realize,

1049
00:44:18,111 --> 00:44:23,111
you have to have a host,
like if if you put something on itunes 

1050
00:44:23,111 --> 00:44:23,450
and it is free,
you know,

1051
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:28,510
I mean you,
you can put your shit on itunes but 

1052
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:31,151
someone has to be downloaded it from 
somewhere and you have to have a host 

1053
00:44:31,151 --> 00:44:32,580
where they doubt like itunes is not like
storing

1054
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,040
your stuff.
They're not providing bandwidth.

1055
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:38,130
They're basically providing a link to a 
website,

1056
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:43,140
a server that you pay for.
And what's funny is that there's a lot 

1057
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,520
of web hosts,
like unfortunately I used dreamhost,

1058
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:49,550
which at all my life has has been great,
but I had to switch to a cloud computing

1059
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:52,830
thing where like a,
but it was unlimited bandwidth.

1060
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,420
Unlimited storage.
No,

1061
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,040
I'm on that.
And then.

1062
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,300
And then.
But what they don't tell you is no,

1063
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:04,310
wait,
it doesn't count like unlimited memory 

1064
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,321
of the computer or something like that.
If there's too many people and yeah.

1065
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,650
So then you have to raise your bandwidth
and it's some bullshit.

1066
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:15,651
The whole thing is a fucking unlimited 
bandwidth and they tell you they trick 

1067
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:17,490
you,
they because then they're like,

1068
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,800
oh yeah,
well it's unlimited debt,

1069
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,330
but you know,
it's your memory,

1070
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,710
you know,
in your computers,

1071
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,150
you know,
you got to have more,

1072
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:25,480
you know,
they trick in that.

1073
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:29,510
So they make you buy more hard drives or
computer program.

1074
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:34,540
Like what do you mean by memory?
Do you mean like data storage space or 

1075
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:38,811
is it like Ram Ram?
Pretty much so you buy more ram and 

1076
00:45:38,811 --> 00:45:40,770
then.
So I like now you're done by Ram,

1077
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,950
but what's bullshit is like dreamhost.
I don't,

1078
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:45,510
I'm sorry,
I'm going to start bashing you now,

1079
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,050
but a dreamhost like we'll have your 
dream house.

1080
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:54,051
You can search,
you can search like how you can have 

1081
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:54,960
graphs of how much you use,
how much ram you use every hour.

1082
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,610
Right?
And so you like,

1083
00:45:56,611 --> 00:45:58,170
I think I'm paying for,
I forget how many,

1084
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:03,171
let's just say a thousand ram.
It will not be using the 400 most of the

1085
00:46:04,171 --> 00:46:07,140
time and then out of nowhere my shit 
will crash and they're like,

1086
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,150
oh,
you need to up your even more random.

1087
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,860
I think they'll do.

1088
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,340
You're,
you're running a lot of traffic.

1089
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:11,500
No,
no,

1090
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:16,560
but what they're saying is that my ram 
has doubled in one second and crashes 

1091
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,451
the computer,
but it doesn't show it on the graph and 

1092
00:46:20,451 --> 00:46:20,451
they're like,
oh,

1093
00:46:20,451 --> 00:46:20,451
let's just their spikes.
And I'm like,

1094
00:46:20,451 --> 00:46:24,351
yeah,
spice a doubling in one second and you 

1095
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:24,351
don't have it on your graph.
Oh.

1096
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:25,050
So then they make you go.
Yeah.

1097
00:46:25,051 --> 00:46:27,650
They can't prove it to you for no 
reason.

1098
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,140
It's so fucking bullshit.
You feel like you got ganged.

1099
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,180
I'm getting ganged every day with 
fucking dream host.

1100
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:38,300
And what's funny is I've had a website 
with them for a long ass time and before

1101
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:41,310
I was on.
Before I was on cloud computing before,

1102
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,950
but when I was just spinning like $18 a 
month,

1103
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,900
I still had a website that got hit a 
lot.

1104
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:50,910
You're doing all the videos at Carl's 
been sia videos and all those other 

1105
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:53,631
videos we used to do all the time.
My shit got hit a lot and it never went 

1106
00:46:53,631 --> 00:46:54,540
down.
It never was a problem.

1107
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,720
But they get you on these cloud 
computing's now it's just fucking dream 

1108
00:46:59,720 --> 00:46:59,720
host.
So I'm saying were,

1109
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:04,820
wow,
this is a very angry Brian dreamhost is 

1110
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:04,820
all fired up,
man.

1111
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:09,570
Find stuff,
gets passionate about his poor little 

1112
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:09,570
site.
It's,

1113
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:13,551
you know,
I feel like you'd be like a lot more 

1114
00:47:13,551 --> 00:47:13,551
comfortable.
He just had a wikipedia page.

1115
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:19,730
I'm getting beat by a.
So you really believe that if you get 

1116
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,491
this shorty award thing that somehow or 
another a few adminis administers who 

1117
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:27,771
have contacted me through wikipedia and 
just fucking trail and you want to tell 

1118
00:47:27,771 --> 00:47:30,250
you a story about George and then once 
once you get a shorty

1119
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,080
award,
they're going to go,

1120
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,340
who the fuck gives a shit about your 
shorty award bids?

1121
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:36,560
And then he got to be like,
God Damn Shorty Award.

1122
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:39,220
They're making me work for it.
Those wikipedia bits making you better.

1123
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,640
Oscar for patent and said,
I'm not going to that.

1124
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,220
And just didn't show up because what the
fuck do I care?

1125
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,210
Wow.
Well,

1126
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:48,730
he was a bad motherfucker.
Did you ever see the hustler?

1127
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,480
George C dot Scott was a scary character
in the hustling.

1128
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,200
You owe me money.
A scary dude,

1129
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:57,460
man.
This is after he.

1130
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:02,820
He's saying he's screaming that Depaul 
Newman after he fucked Paul Newman's 

1131
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,960
girlfriend and forced her to commit 
suicide.

1132
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,690
And then he said,
you owe me money.

1133
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:08,990
I was like,
whoa.

1134
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:14,470
It was a scary dude because that was a 
great fucking movie man.

1135
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,760
Imagine how good that moving must've 
been in like why?

1136
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:21,310
What was it like 64 or something like 
that was a really old movie.

1137
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:25,270
You know?
Imagine how good it was that fucking.

1138
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:28,330
There's some movies managers hold up and
there's other ones you watch.

1139
00:48:28,331 --> 00:48:30,550
You just go,
what the fuck?

1140
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:33,040
Like what happened?
What happened between,

1141
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:38,041
you know,
I was going to come to it when I saw 

1142
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:38,041
stuff like that in movies.
I don't know why it made me like,

1143
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:43,260
feel extra bet with some girl being 
unfaithful really fucking over somebody 

1144
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,380
sexually.
I'd always made me feel like,

1145
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,690
Oh god,
that bothers you the most way,

1146
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:51,691
worse than a to homeless people.
Did you when you were a young girl that 

1147
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,250
you were really in love with?
And she,

1148
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:59,270
she left him for another dude.
He always thought that that was gonna 

1149
00:48:59,270 --> 00:48:59,270
happen.
Maybe.

1150
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,520
Maybe that's maybe because it didn't 
happen seat to me,

1151
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,200
my data to gang up pores in a row and I 
caught a bunch of them,

1152
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:09,700
Bang another dudes.

1153
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:12,100
And so when that happens,
it's like,

1154
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,210
it lowers expectations so it's fine,
you know?

1155
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:16,730
I mean,
I,

1156
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:21,731
I realized as I got older than it was 
mostly my fault and I was attracted the 

1157
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:23,740
wrong person into my life.
You know,

1158
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:25,470
you're tracking but you're tracking 
somebody.

1159
00:49:25,471 --> 00:49:25,780
No,
no,

1160
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,700
no.
Or just like the fuck.

1161
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:30,080
And you're like,
damn it on love.

1162
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,320
Part of it is that,
and part of it is subconsciously,

1163
00:49:32,321 --> 00:49:35,590
I think you're just trying to attract 
the wrong person possible.

1164
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,340
Subconsciously you don't think you're 
worthy of anybody any good.

1165
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:44,341
So you can just get these nightmares 
that you know are never going to last 

1166
00:49:44,341 --> 00:49:46,760
and then you get stuck.
I love how Dr you're always says that of

1167
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,100
like you always say this type of person.
I'm like,

1168
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:49,650
no.
I mean,

1169
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,500
yeah,
they all hit me,

1170
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:52,330
but what do you mean there's no 
correlation?

1171
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:53,290
Right.
My Dad had made.

1172
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,020
People are fucking strange with 
patterns.

1173
00:49:56,021 --> 00:50:01,021
Man.
That's strange with getting locked into 

1174
00:50:01,021 --> 00:50:01,021
things.
You know,

1175
00:50:01,021 --> 00:50:03,930
like I,
I knew dudes and I never understood 

1176
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:04,000
this.
They could not stop going to the track.

1177
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:08,200
They would go to the race track and to 
them it was their crack man.

1178
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,270
They,
there was guys that didn't even have any

1179
00:50:10,271 --> 00:50:15,271
money and they would go and hang out 
with dudes who had money hoping that if 

1180
00:50:15,271 --> 00:50:20,101
the guy wants something,
he would give them a gapper so they 

1181
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:20,101
could fucking put it on.
Yeah,

1182
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:24,150
well that's the gamblers creed.
A gapper is he throwed 20 this guy's 

1183
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:24,790
way.
He sweats your match.

1184
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:27,380
You throw 50 his way.
Like it's a big thing in the pool world,

1185
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:28,130
like say if

1186
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:33,440
you know,
if you are hanging with a bunch of guys 

1187
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:33,440
and everyone's broken,
one guy wins a bunch of money,

1188
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,380
he'll give his friend some money if 
you're hanging out with them and they 

1189
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:38,550
sweat is match,
watch,

1190
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,270
watch this match.
And it's sort of like when you give guys

1191
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,570
gappers it gets,
you know,

1192
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:50,130
it's the right intention.
It spreads a little money around that 

1193
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,021
way one day when you're broke because 
all the pool hustlers,

1194
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:58,550
all all professional pool players at one
point in time we're probably broke or 

1195
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:00,590
will be broke again.
It's a tough one.

1196
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,430
You know when you're out there gambling 
and you're trying to play in tournaments

1197
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:09,431
and you can't get roles and you're 
trying to make money and you're trying 

1198
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:10,010
to pay for hotel bills and it's a hard 
life.

1199
00:51:10,011 --> 00:51:15,011
Was the life of the professional pool 
player at of all the skill games of the 

1200
00:51:15,011 --> 00:51:15,740
world might be one of the hardest lines.

1201
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,210
They don't make that much money,
man.

1202
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,070
It's hard.
It's a hard gig.

1203
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:24,460
It's hard to put it together.
There's only a few guys at the very top 

1204
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,921
that really make money aren't.
It's how much easier your gigs the 

1205
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:30,431
easiest,
but you got to be funny if you're not 

1206
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,561
funny or Gigis to death.
We can't catch a break if you're not 

1207
00:51:32,561 --> 00:51:35,861
supposed to be a comedian.
Our gig is the scariest thing in the 

1208
00:51:35,861 --> 00:51:35,861
world for a lot of people.
A lot of guys weren't supposed to be.

1209
00:51:35,861 --> 00:51:37,280
Comedians are doing.
Isn't that weird?

1210
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:38,990
It is weird.
You're like,

1211
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,520
what?
We all.

1212
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,040
Everyone agrees you're bad.
It's.

1213
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,630
Yeah.
It's weird how some guys,

1214
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,640
even though they're terrible,
somehow or another,

1215
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:51,641
they wound up sticking around long 
enough to get paid for it occasionally 

1216
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:53,240
and not a lot,
but every now and then they'll get a gig

1217
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:55,970
here and a gig there and you'll have 
plenty of money and you're like,

1218
00:51:55,971 --> 00:51:57,200
what the fuck is going on?

1219
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,430
Like,
is it just,

1220
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:00,770
uh,
making friends thing title?

1221
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:05,810
And it's totally a lot of it because 
there's a few people that we know who 

1222
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:06,020
they are and we to have to say any names
here,

1223
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,830
but when they go on stage,
it's like they're,

1224
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:11,930
they're doing their best impression of a
comedian.

1225
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:12,920
Yeah.
You know,

1226
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,410
I think everybody who starts comedy,
sure.

1227
00:52:15,411 --> 00:52:18,500
But these are like,
let me get the impression.

1228
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:19,940
Yeah,
yeah.

1229
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:24,941
You know,
those will you work with them on the 

1230
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:24,941
road somewhere and you're like,
what the fuck am I seeing?

1231
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,400
But they tricked somebody into hiring 
them somewhere.

1232
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:33,970
I think there's enough comedians now 
that they don't ever have to do that 

1233
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:33,970
anymore.
There's not necessarily one of us,

1234
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,870
you know,
there's enough comedians,

1235
00:52:35,871 --> 00:52:37,480
you know,
you just kinda like getting Qa.

1236
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,310
It needs to be a network where people 
can find where the good ones are.

1237
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:44,750
I sent a resurgence,
I said I think comedy back all this junk

1238
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:46,950
is helping a lot of people get to know 
people were easier.

1239
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:47,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

1240
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:49,430
Podcast help for sure.
They're like,

1241
00:52:49,431 --> 00:52:51,740
oh,
these comedians are like cool thing sort

1242
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:53,570
of talking and stuff.
And yeah,

1243
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:58,571
having having a podcast and having 
people come to the shows because of the 

1244
00:52:58,571 --> 00:53:01,541
podcast,
but I think even besides outside of the 

1245
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:01,541
podcast,
like,

1246
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:01,541
like Louis Ck,
you know,

1247
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:03,800
his situation where selling is things 
online.

1248
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:06,560
I think that gives a big resurgence to 
it too.

1249
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:11,650
People hear the story about it.
I just remember the last comic standing 

1250
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:11,650
start at the comedy store.
Numbers went way up.

1251
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,440
I had remembered.
Oh yeah,

1252
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,460
comedy.
Comedy is fucking great man.

1253
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,690
Such a great night.
Yeah.

1254
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:18,840
As a fan,
you know,

1255
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,440
before I was ever a comedian,
that was my favorite thing to do.

1256
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:26,500
Yeah.
I would never pay a lot extra for it on 

1257
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:26,500
new years because I've seen too much or 
anything like that.

1258
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,250
Like it's just a good fun date.
Yeah.

1259
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,270
Yeah.
Especially,

1260
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:31,710
you know,
if people in town,

1261
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:32,760
whatever.
Yeah,

1262
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:37,890
we've gone on the road and I have a 
couple of times and I'm in town when 

1263
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:41,340
someone I'd like is playing someone,
then I go see him and I can actually sit

1264
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:44,700
and watch like a,
the store.

1265
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,920
It's a bastion of so goddamn funny.
Really.

1266
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,140
He's so fucking funny.
Yeah.

1267
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,270
It's just so fun to watch.
I was like,

1268
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:52,860
yeah,
somebody made a date out of this.

1269
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,390
It's,
it's cool art form,

1270
00:53:56,391 --> 00:54:01,391
man.
I love watching just as much as I love 

1271
00:54:01,391 --> 00:54:01,391
doing it.
Yeah,

1272
00:54:01,391 --> 00:54:01,391
we're lucky as shit,
man.

1273
00:54:01,391 --> 00:54:03,030
I've watched ice road truckers the other
day.

1274
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,710
That's way harder.
It's way harder.

1275
00:54:04,711 --> 00:54:07,650
Imagine being an ice road trucker.
Imagine that.

1276
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,060
I know the worst job,
the worst job.

1277
00:54:09,061 --> 00:54:11,060
What's the worst job?
Do you want to hookers?

1278
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:16,080
Cost cost $2 and it's the breakdown was 
set 60 for the girl,

1279
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,460
but she splits up with a pim.
However,

1280
00:54:17,461 --> 00:54:18,420
I'm not sure.
Uh,

1281
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:22,020
11 for the room and one for the cleanup 
guy.

1282
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:25,620
That's the worst job.
One dollar cleanup.

1283
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:29,790
Just spots and probably over and over 
again.

1284
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:33,720
Just just a ton of people all over 
everybody.

1285
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:39,450
Everything's going on during the day.
There's still at full capacity in 

1286
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,651
business.
It's really crazy how close that is to 

1287
00:54:42,651 --> 00:54:43,440
San Diego that everybody used to do that
as their trip.

1288
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:48,580
But could you imagine man,
being a person who lives in Tijuana and 

1289
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,210
just knowing that San Diego is right 
there and right there,

1290
00:54:50,211 --> 00:54:55,211
there's white people with $7,
million dollar houses on the beach and 

1291
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:59,441
they're drinking.
Margarita does and talking about their 

1292
00:54:59,441 --> 00:55:01,610
pedicure lady grows border town.
You're in a house made out of cardboard.

1293
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:05,540
It's just 20 minutes away.
Drive to their house in 20 minutes.

1294
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:08,390
That's insane.
How weird is that?

1295
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:09,140
Weird.
Is it?

1296
00:55:09,141 --> 00:55:12,950
That is a third world and the peak of 
the first world.

1297
00:55:12,951 --> 00:55:16,530
San Diego is a pretty God damn nice.
Beautiful play.

1298
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,540
Yeah.
There's one,

1299
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:20,480
there's one island.
I forget what the island is.

1300
00:55:20,481 --> 00:55:22,940
It's off of San Diego.
It's like a little,

1301
00:55:22,941 --> 00:55:27,941
a very small and very exclusive island 
where it's one of the richest pieces of 

1302
00:55:28,341 --> 00:55:31,460
real estate in the country.
That's what Donald Rumsfeld.

1303
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:34,160
No Catalina's off of this area.
It's like Santa Monica.

1304
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:38,030
This one is off.
It's a small jump between this.

1305
00:55:38,031 --> 00:55:42,710
And I forget what it's called.
Super wealthy people like ridiculous,

1306
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,600
stupid fucking mansions,
you know,

1307
00:55:44,601 --> 00:55:46,100
$20,000,000
properties.

1308
00:55:46,101 --> 00:55:49,370
Shit like that.
And that's like a drive to Mexico.

1309
00:55:49,371 --> 00:55:54,090
Man.
It's so bizarre and I guess I dunno,

1310
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,050
I mean I guess the Mexicans,
if they want to get in the boat and just

1311
00:55:57,051 --> 00:56:00,560
sneak up and get that really quick,
just pull into their neighborhood with a

1312
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:05,561
boat for real man.
You could be like hardcore Mexican,

1313
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:08,120
you know,
gang bangers.

1314
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:13,150
They have some castles.
They're hardcore Mexican drug dealers 

1315
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:13,310
and just getting a boat,
just get in a boat and figured out a way

1316
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:15,710
to just do it by cover of night.

1317
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,780
Going to rehab there.
Do they really do.

1318
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,790
Like I said,
don't get off the sauce.

1319
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:24,100
What's really were in,
in to

1320
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,770
all the border towns.
Like how you said that too.

1321
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:28,210
Don't get off the sauce.
So if you're in 19 forties movie,

1322
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:30,510
bad guy,
who the fuck is that?

1323
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,600
You listen to me say watching old movies
like watching a movie from another 

1324
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:41,311
country.
I've been watching the one where we 

1325
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:41,311
really mad it's not.
So that's

1326
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:44,940
for like 20 years ago we were talking 
about like Clark Gable type shit.

1327
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:49,970
You're talking about Billy Madison.
I'm talking about watching some stuff 

1328
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:50,700
from wash some stuff from like the 
forties and fifties.

1329
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:52,070
I love it.
I'm addicted.

1330
00:56:52,071 --> 00:56:53,970
Different language.
I love looking at that.

1331
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:57,030
Or what have you ever seen?
That's good.

1332
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,400
I just watched.
Um,

1333
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:04,990
Ooh,
that's a great site with the one with 

1334
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:05,220
Clark Gable.
A gone with the wind.

1335
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:06,010
Oh yeah.
That's great.

1336
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:08,360
We talked about that yet,
but it was weird.

1337
00:57:08,361 --> 00:57:10,890
It had like slavery aspects in that and 
stuff like that.

1338
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,780
Yeah.
Well that's what's going down back then.

1339
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,550
There was something else I just watched 
here.

1340
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,310
Have you ever seen who's afraid of 
Virginia Woolf?

1341
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,750
No.
So I'm Elizabeth with the flux.

1342
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:24,580
Her name,
the pitcher got married 100,000

1343
00:57:24,581 --> 00:57:27,910
times.
Liz Taylor,

1344
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:33,380
Elizabeth Taylor,
Elizabeth Taylor when she was hot as 

1345
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:33,380
fuck.
Fine.

1346
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,870
When she was young.
My God,

1347
00:57:34,871 --> 00:57:36,820
that woman was.
That's why we still talk about her.

1348
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,660
She was hot.
I don't know if she's still alive,

1349
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,880
you know,
I don't know,

1350
00:57:42,881 --> 00:57:43,510
but she's,
you know,

1351
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,520
she's getting older.
She's married.

1352
00:57:45,521 --> 00:57:46,980
Couple of gay guys along the way.
It got,

1353
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,230
it got weird for awhile.
Poor lady when she was young though,

1354
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:52,810
man.
God Damn.

1355
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,640
I mean,
it falls apart for everybody,

1356
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:58,360
but I think for her it was just.
That's such a great thing.

1357
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:01,720
Did you ever watch you the wall?
Everybody hits the wall.

1358
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:07,290
You're like an $800,
billion years of development wall has 

1359
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:08,800
never lost.
Undefeated was $6 billion in.

1360
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:13,860
Oh no one's ever beaten the wall.
Wall's coming and bitch.

1361
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,480
It's coming for you too.
Did you ever see the color purple?

1362
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:21,930
Yes.
I think obviously the what color color 

1363
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:21,930
granola.
I might not have seen that.

1364
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,160
I was really stoned and watching oprah

1365
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:26,240
and it was really weird.
Slavery,

1366
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,490
sexual slavery Shit,
and it was weird.

1367
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:31,850
That was a big part of slavery.
So we're a big part of slavery.

1368
00:58:31,851 --> 00:58:36,851
Was the master coming down and banging 
the Danny Glover was legit,

1369
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:38,010
man.
They used to have children,

1370
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,670
but yeah,
but that's what it was.

1371
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:41,270
I couldn't watch it.
It was just too,

1372
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,290
too creepy.

1373
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,340
Kalpa was right after slavery.
He thought.

1374
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:47,060
What was the color purple?
I don't know.

1375
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,890
I'm pretty sure I didn't actually say 
it.

1376
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:51,350
It's one of those that I always intend 
on seeing,

1377
00:58:51,351 --> 00:58:55,460
but I never get around to it,
but I think it was like super common for

1378
00:58:55,461 --> 00:58:57,320
the slave owners to have sex with their 
slaves.

1379
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:59,090
Oh yeah.
Benjamin Franklin,

1380
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:04,150
right.
You have a ton of grandkids that will 

1381
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:05,740
wonder how many of the male slaves had 
sex with the women because that must 

1382
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:09,211
have been going on too,
where women were ignored and slaves to 

1383
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:09,211
bang them.
God,

1384
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:11,240
the punishment for that was just clearly
duff.

1385
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,650
I'm wonder,
is it worth it?

1386
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,480
I wonder.
I wonder if you're allowed to.

1387
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,460
They must.
Must've been those stories of having ha,

1388
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,650
she gets pregnant.
Who did it?

1389
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:19,770
Yeah.
I mean,

1390
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:21,710
listen man,

1391
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:24,920
as long as there's dudes sling and Dick,
this chick's jumping on them.

1392
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:29,980
As long as I've been black people,
they have been attracted to white women 

1393
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,760
and as long as had been white women,
they've been attracted to black now like

1394
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:36,860
my weed and smoke my dick to the slave.
That's what she would say,

1395
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:42,080
and that's what you would say to you,
your Arcelor grow my weed and suck my 

1396
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:42,080
dick smoked.
My Dad smoked my deck.

1397
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:45,420
Brian sometimes write these down and go 
over them and go,

1398
00:59:45,421 --> 00:59:48,110
is this worth it?
Interjecting in their grill,

1399
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:50,420
my wheels out and you're like,
dammit,

1400
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,850
that wasn't good.
So then when it comes from a good place,

1401
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,330
we have to remember that we're talking 
about if I was.

1402
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,960
You guys were talking about slaves,
right?

1403
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,450
Knocking your slaves.
Yeah,

1404
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:03,660
I get ya.
And I just said I wouldn't be doing a 

1405
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:03,660
bit.

1406
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:03,660
I just thought it was trying to talk to 
him.

1407
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:08,720
It's okay buddy.
We're just trying to keep the 

1408
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:08,720
conversation moving.
I'm not trying to be harsh.

1409
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,290
I'm going to be in Minneapolis when you 
do it at the end of.

1410
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:11,780
I'm an acme brick.
Bronson's house of comedy.

1411
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,760
Oh,
what is that new place?

1412
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,870
Yeah,
he owns the place that I mentioned,

1413
01:00:14,871 --> 01:00:19,300
so I love Minneapolis,
but I can't say that fucking wintertime.

1414
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:21,680
Son To mall of America.
I might never have to leave.

1415
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,320
So you go.
You fly into the mall?

1416
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,330
No,
I will have to go from the flight.

1417
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:27,650
Somehow or other.
You're going to be outside.

1418
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,990
You're going to have to be in that tube 
plate.

1419
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:31,610
The winter.

1420
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:40,540
It's cold as fuck.
It's like it gets like Zeros.

1421
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,620
That's why I'm going to.
Thursday.

1422
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,750
It's going to start snowing.
Third,

1423
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:45,470
Ohio.
Yeah.

1424
01:00:45,471 --> 01:00:46,730
Right now it's $50.
Supposedly.

1425
01:00:46,731 --> 01:00:49,750
There's just like the sleet and freezing
rain and snow storms.

1426
01:00:49,751 --> 01:00:51,880
Shit gone that day.
I planned I,

1427
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:55,010
I hit freezing rain once in Ohio to the 
three 60 on the highway.

1428
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,270
Really?
Yup.

1429
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,450
Me and Christopher Dwyer.
Threesixty.

1430
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,620
Yup.
Flipped all the way around.

1431
01:01:00,621 --> 01:01:02,080
Mr.
Guardrail missed everything.

1432
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:05,180
We just kept driving.
My Dad was driving over the bridge,

1433
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:10,210
you know,
how's your bridges and bridges is a 

1434
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:10,210
place where for.
Yeah.

1435
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:11,610
Because actually the wind coming the 
fruit.

1436
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:14,000
So how about that?
Three 60 on a bridge.

1437
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:15,860
What'd you hit?
Nothing.

1438
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:16,960
Wow.
Yeah.

1439
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,350
Spun around.
That must be God,

1440
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:19,020
right?
Yep.

1441
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:20,870
Yeah.
That must be.

1442
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,480
Why isn't it?
God Ari fucking.

1443
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:27,600
Maybe it's the secret.
Maybe you did that.

1444
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,180
Go.
Maybe engineered it.

1445
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:32,960
So my dad used to have this giant 
suburban,

1446
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:34,560
the old style suburbans oh those are 
great.

1447
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,040
Second and third motor in it.
He just kept it going.

1448
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,290
But he would see people start to skid 
like in the,

1449
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,040
in the snow and like come and like,
uh,

1450
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:43,790
you know,
10 miles an hour just like that.

1451
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:45,320
He just like,
here we go,

1452
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:49,310
let's just get some cash.
He's just trying to be like,

1453
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:51,710
let's just do this off the books.
Oh,

1454
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:53,500
that's what you do.
Serious.

1455
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:58,220
Never fixed shit going to be about looks
like $800 of damage.

1456
01:01:58,221 --> 01:01:59,330
Right?
Let's go,

1457
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:01,190
let's do this.
And they would give him 800 bucks.

1458
01:02:01,191 --> 01:02:06,191
How many people hit him?
It happened like every other song do we 

1459
01:02:06,191 --> 01:02:09,930
do just go out when it's stolen and try 
to make sure this is one stop earning a 

1460
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:14,721
university.
And when they cut their university in 

1461
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:14,721
Arcola,
it wouldn't be like,

1462
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:16,860
it was just downhill and it was like 
people will start to go there,

1463
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:21,880
then just quit and stop.
It could cover snow and if you're the 

1464
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:21,880
bottom of the hill,
they're

1465
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:21,880
coming right at you.
Nothing you can do.

1466
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:25,650
I lived on a street that a completely 
froze and became a hockey rink.

1467
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:30,890
And me and my girlfriends or my brother 
and my sister's boyfriend sat on the 

1468
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:34,140
roof and watch.
We drank beers and watch cars crash.

1469
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:38,080
Slide down the hill.
It's my favorite,

1470
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:43,090
but watching that we called the cops.
We called the cops and the cops fucking 

1471
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:44,100
do the same thing.
They did the same thing.

1472
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:48,570
We told them we saw the first car slide 
by the house and we're like,

1473
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:49,770
what the fuck?
I go,

1474
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:51,570
dude,
I think the street is ice now.

1475
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,470
And so we,
uh,

1476
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:55,290
we opened up the door and looked and it 
looked like ice.

1477
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,150
I'm like,
it looks wet for sure.

1478
01:02:57,151 --> 01:02:58,590
And I got up to him like,
fuck,

1479
01:02:58,591 --> 01:03:00,600
it's just a whole,
the whole street.

1480
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:01,440
And we were on a hill.

1481
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,480
So the whole street is just a sheet of 
ice.

1482
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,310
And one after another car just came down
and boom,

1483
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:12,410
hit the curb.
And when flying off into the fucking 

1484
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,080
woods went over and over and over and 
over this habit.

1485
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:15,960
So we called the cops immediately.
So the cops came down.

1486
01:03:15,961 --> 01:03:16,980
Same thing,
Bang.

1487
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:20,520
The cops bounce off the curb and the 
cops slam into the other cars.

1488
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,320
Everybody,
yeah,

1489
01:03:21,321 --> 01:03:26,321
they were piling into each other and all
the cars are parked on the side of the 

1490
01:03:26,321 --> 01:03:26,321
street.
They were all stuck.

1491
01:03:26,321 --> 01:03:27,900
They were all stuck and jammed and 
fucked up.

1492
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:33,080
Like some of them were like little 
ditches and some of them were like in 

1493
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,320
the woods where the bushes were in shit 
and they just kept coming.

1494
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,140
Oh yeah.
Some people got through it.

1495
01:03:37,141 --> 01:03:42,141
Some people had some good skills.
Some people just slid with it and kind 

1496
01:03:42,141 --> 01:03:42,720
of like straightened it out.

1497
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:48,110
Yeah.
They managed to come down the hill not 

1498
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:48,110
too crazy.
Whoa.

1499
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:48,230
That makes it more exciting.
You never know what's going to have.

1500
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:49,800
Well,
I think the real,

1501
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:54,970
the people that really fucked up,
they fucked up because they came down 

1502
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:54,970
the hill like they were driving.
They want to drive.

1503
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:55,860
Yeah.
And then all of a sudden,

1504
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:58,350
oh fuck.
So if you're going 40,

1505
01:03:58,351 --> 01:04:00,030
50 miles an hour,
whatever the hell you were.

1506
01:04:00,031 --> 01:04:01,080
And then you hit that ice,
that's,

1507
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:01,950
that's it,
bitch.

1508
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:07,660
I'm like,
put the Nascar is going to do it makes 

1509
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:07,660
you think,
man.

1510
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:07,660
Fuck living anywhere where it's that 
cold.

1511
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,090
We were talking about this before the 
show,

1512
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:09,990
um,
that,

1513
01:04:09,991 --> 01:04:10,890
uh,
there's a,

1514
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:15,420
um,
a icebound fuel tanker in Alaska.

1515
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,540
It stuck in the ocean.
Yeah.

1516
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:23,630
The ocean is frozen around this fucking 
boat and so they got to send a coast 

1517
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:25,110
guard ice cutter.

1518
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:30,650
So the ice cutter is breaking the ice 
around this Russian tanker and it's 

1519
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:35,460
Russian tankers just stopped there in a 
just gigantic skating rink.

1520
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:41,030
That's the ocean and it's just creeping 
around pressing against the hall.

1521
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,280
Did you imagine the trillions of pounds 
over the.

1522
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:48,280
Just be so scared.
Oh my God.

1523
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:50,250
You're thinking it's going to pop.
The whole thing's gonna pop it.

1524
01:04:50,251 --> 01:04:55,251
I'm going to die.
I'm gonna die right here on the top of 

1525
01:04:55,251 --> 01:04:55,800
this fucking frozen bullshit.
There was an episode from frozen tanker.

1526
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:56,910
Really?
Yeah.

1527
01:04:56,911 --> 01:04:59,940
They got frozen and then some virus was 
out to kill them.

1528
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,330
Fuck that.
Returning old.

1529
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:05,550
Super quick rate.
Oh,

1530
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:06,790
with the virus.
That's what it was about.

1531
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,730
Yeah.
So they had to drink regular water.

1532
01:05:08,731 --> 01:05:13,731
The only water they had was infected and
so it would make them turn old and I 

1533
01:05:13,731 --> 01:05:13,731
couldn't get any worse.
They were frozen in.

1534
01:05:13,731 --> 01:05:14,640
There was no.
So what they do,

1535
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,960
they got rescued right before the

1536
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,010
got sent back.
Oh,

1537
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,810
they get sent back to the regulates how 
convenient.

1538
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:25,560
Well,
they fed them regular water or say,

1539
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:26,590
oh,
that's all it took.

1540
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:32,020
We just need to get them saline.
You can reverse this fucking stupid 

1541
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:32,020
plot.
Who wrote that?

1542
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,370
How dare you?
Whoever you are.

1543
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:36,460
That was at the end of the x files when 
they were basically just phoning it in.

1544
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,380
I'm trying to think when that was.
I don't know.

1545
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:42,850
Maybe it was like,
this isn't just to find something.

1546
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:45,490
I don't know why they were out there.
That comes in time when some people just

1547
01:05:45,491 --> 01:05:50,491
fall it in certain amount of seasons.
Last we're done trying was why athletes 

1548
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:56,761
always post date.
They're giant contracts because like I 

1549
01:05:56,761 --> 01:05:56,761
might get another contract.
I'm going,

1550
01:05:56,761 --> 01:05:59,470
I'm done working.
I'm not going to be 30 million million.

1551
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,160
They get more money as,
as the contract goes on your contract.

1552
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:05,320
So you're making like three times as 
much in the 10th year as you were in the

1553
01:06:05,321 --> 01:06:05,830
first year.

1554
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:06,870
Oh really?
Yeah,

1555
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,260
but that's when you're going to be way 
worse.

1556
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:14,100
Sure.
Unless you're some crazy person that's 

1557
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:14,100
completely dedicated to always be in the
best ever.

1558
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:19,370
You know.
How bad did Michael Jordan fall off 

1559
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:19,370
before he quit?
He didn't.

1560
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:20,440
He did quit the first time he was mvp 
level.

1561
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:22,120
No,
not when he quit to play baseball.

1562
01:06:22,121 --> 01:06:22,870
When he quit,
quit,

1563
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:23,440
quit,
quit.

1564
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:28,490
Um,
when he came back he wasn't quite as 

1565
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:28,560
good.
Yeah,

1566
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:30,640
he came back after that.
That's right.

1567
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,420
Yeah,
he was bad.

1568
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:35,020
Then he said he really hurt the wizards.
The bullets really because everyone sort

1569
01:06:35,021 --> 01:06:38,110
of stand around and watch him Jordan's 
time.

1570
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,090
So everyone else got worse.
Oh,

1571
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:42,010
that's crazy.
That's funny.

1572
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:47,190
So they got to give him the ball so much
jerry stackhouse and people had to like 

1573
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:48,730
watch him,
like he's got to be our first option.

1574
01:06:48,731 --> 01:06:49,980
I used to,
now I'm the second one.

1575
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:54,760
I guess I'm just not as into it really.
That's fast and really heard the wizards

1576
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:57,190
because they could have been like A.
I've gotten up one or two pick,

1577
01:06:57,191 --> 01:07:02,191
but instead he just came.
So they end up getting like eight or 

1578
01:07:02,191 --> 01:07:04,831
nine pick.
So how long did he play with them for a 

1579
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:04,831
year?
Maybe two.

1580
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,700
So that was that he took off the time 
for baseball,

1581
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:09,640
like one year you take baseball,
maybe two,

1582
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:11,380
maybe one.
I'm not sure.

1583
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:12,970
Why do we want to be like,
well,

1584
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,310
my dad's on my last game.
His Dad got murdered.

1585
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,500
Oh yeah.
I remember about the side of the road in

1586
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:19,240
North Carolina.
What the fuck,

1587
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
you know?
And then who's gonna buy the fucking 

1588
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Hornets when they were still in 
Charlotte.

1589
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,680
But the owner got super juicy and greedy
about it and he was like,

1590
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:27,970
if you buy it will be worth more.

1591
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:32,360
So I don't want money on Michael Jordan 
franchise.

1592
01:07:32,361 --> 01:07:34,510
What are you worth more so you gotta pay
more than this place is worth.

1593
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:39,310
What kind of ridiculous fucking is that?
He lost it.

1594
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,950
People are funny that way.
You,

1595
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:44,230
you hear some ridiculous claims that 
people wouldn't want,

1596
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:49,700
you know,
the one thing sometimes it just makes 

1597
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:49,700
you just go,
what?

1598
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:54,420
That's a pretty ridiculous one.
Reasonable that he brings that money to 

1599
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:59,551
anyone.
Then some people will just unreasonable 

1600
01:07:59,551 --> 01:07:59,551
cousins.
Yeah.

1601
01:07:59,551 --> 01:07:59,551
You see David Cross on Conan O'brien 
last night?

1602
01:07:59,551 --> 01:08:01,510
No.
What did you do it David Cross Jewish.

1603
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:03,730
Um,
yeah,

1604
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:05,590
uh,
he,

1605
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:06,610
he was hilarious,
man.

1606
01:08:06,611 --> 01:08:07,750
He,
he was promoting,

1607
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,710
one of the movies he did was chipmunks 
too.

1608
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:10,990
It's pretty out there.
Atheist though.

1609
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:16,290
Yeah.
He was promoting chipmunks too and he 

1610
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:16,290
was just like bashing and don't fucking 
go see

1611
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:21,100
this movie.
And one of the producers like calling 

1612
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:21,100
out a producer and even called her out 
as being a female.

1613
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,130
He didn't even say her name and he goes,
you know,

1614
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:28,150
Blah Blah Blah.
He just went off and then he started 

1615
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:28,150
saying,
you know what,

1616
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:31,070
she has all the qualities of why people 
when they say they hate Jewish people or

1617
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:36,071
something like that or like,
like it was like so uncomfortable and 

1618
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:40,691
even cone and you could tell they edited
something right out of there because it 

1619
01:08:40,691 --> 01:08:41,020
was like one of those weird cuts where 
it's like,

1620
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,370
let's talk about this other show,
you know,

1621
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:44,930
Holy Shit,
it was weird.

1622
01:08:44,931 --> 01:08:49,931
I think you can watch it probably on 
whatever cross does not strike me as an 

1623
01:08:49,931 --> 01:08:53,171
angry God.
He was upset and I just ran into him at 

1624
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:53,171
the airport the other day was super 
pleasant.

1625
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:53,171
Oh No,
no.

1626
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,160
He just seemed like he was pissed off at
somebody.

1627
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:56,630
That's what I'm saying,

1628
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:57,160
saying,
oh,

1629
01:08:57,190 --> 01:09:01,150
someone got him that riled up.
He be angry on

1630
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:06,540
it was just doing it to separate himself
from the fact that he's doing shipwreck 

1631
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:09,550
mock all movies.
He said the movie,

1632
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:14,640
that's what he's doing.
He said even the movie is a giant 

1633
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,010
commercial for whatever that,
that,

1634
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:18,190
that a boat company is that they used in
the movie.

1635
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:21,100
A boat company.
What's one of the cruise ships?

1636
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:23,200
One of the cruise ships.
She's like,

1637
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:25,300
it's just a big fucking commercial for 
them anyways,

1638
01:09:25,301 --> 01:09:30,301
and,
and he just started going off on the 

1639
01:09:30,301 --> 01:09:30,301
movie to that point where he's saying 
the movies,

1640
01:09:30,301 --> 01:09:33,120
it's bullshit and it's much worse than 
the monks.

1641
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,080
But he also did.
It was beautiful.

1642
01:09:35,081 --> 01:09:37,750
It was love to see it coming from the 
first one.

1643
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:40,070
I chose to take the money but just like 
shit on it.

1644
01:09:40,071 --> 01:09:40,500
Okay.
Right afterwards,

1645
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,480
if it's funny,
is he shooting on it and being funny?

1646
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:46,650
She's just joking around.
Call it up.

1647
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:49,410
Yeah.
It was on last night.

1648
01:09:49,411 --> 01:09:54,411
I'm sure.
I read a thing on his website where he 

1649
01:09:54,411 --> 01:09:56,781
had to defend himself when he was doing 
it the first time that all these 

1650
01:09:56,781 --> 01:10:00,350
hipsters were angry at him for doing the
chipmunks but that and like men in 

1651
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:04,370
black,
they were mad at him for that defend 

1652
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:04,370
himself.
What do you care?

1653
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:05,280
He's just doing a little kid's movie.
Who gives a shit?

1654
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:10,460
Yeah,
that shit on like Tim Allen for doing 

1655
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,850
like the Santa Claus and I'm like,
it's a fun scene.

1656
01:10:11,851 --> 01:10:16,851
Is a bunch of bullies who were picked on
when they were younger and they became 

1657
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:17,250
bullies.
There's not all.

1658
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,940
I shouldn't say the whole scene.
It's not the whole scene.

1659
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:25,080
It's part of the alternative scene is 
the pointing fingers at people and 

1660
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,720
talking down about people and the 
shitting on people.

1661
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:33,290
You know,
there's a lot of people that are nice 

1662
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:33,480
people and I don't like the racks,
but they're nice and I like seeing them.

1663
01:10:33,481 --> 01:10:35,330
There's a lot of people that I like 
seeing names.

1664
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:40,340
Seven can.
I can name a few that I wouldn't do it 

1665
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:40,340
on the air.
It wouldn't be seven,

1666
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,380
but it might be for,
that might be five.

1667
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:43,720
Oh,
there's plenty of people you don't like.

1668
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:45,720
A lot of those people you don't like at 
all.

1669
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:46,830
Yeah,
well they just,

1670
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:48,150
you know,
there's annoying people.

1671
01:10:48,151 --> 01:10:50,400
But the,
the point is there's,

1672
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,070
there's a certain,
uh,

1673
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:56,360
in an it club,
you know,

1674
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:58,650
being a part of it,
that scene,

1675
01:10:58,651 --> 01:11:03,651
the alternative scene and there's,
it's a very judgmental and sort of like 

1676
01:11:03,651 --> 01:11:03,970
a bitchy little scene,
you know,

1677
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,210
not,
I don't want to generalize completely,

1678
01:11:06,211 --> 01:11:11,211
but the idea that I always got was that 
they were like the dorks in high school 

1679
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,880
and now they're powerful if the power,
but they're,

1680
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:19,930
they're turning on other people the same
way people turned on them in high 

1681
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:19,930
school.

1682
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:21,450
It's not as bad as I did now.
It's way better,

1683
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:24,570
but it just seemed like there was a vibe
of that.

1684
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,960
Bert Bert Kreischer told me a horrible 
story once about a,

1685
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,030
a bunch of alternative guy's being mean 
to him.

1686
01:11:30,031 --> 01:11:30,660
And I was like,
you know,

1687
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:33,570
like it's,
it's so stupid.

1688
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,020
You know,
when,

1689
01:11:34,021 --> 01:11:39,021
when you see someone like our thing just
like saying Brooklyn's the best or 

1690
01:11:39,901 --> 01:11:42,270
stockton's the bath,
if it's clearly not well,

1691
01:11:42,271 --> 01:11:47,271
you know,
there's just like saying our thing is 

1692
01:11:47,271 --> 01:11:49,550
the people we run into are the best 
comics in the world and it's like I'm 

1693
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:49,560
not other people that you randomly 
didn't want it to.

1694
01:11:49,561 --> 01:11:54,561
I think it's also a thing where people 
want confirmation that they're on the 

1695
01:11:54,561 --> 01:11:55,500
right track and the best way to do that 
is to shit on people.

1696
01:11:55,501 --> 01:11:57,300
We're on a different.
Got To make your team then most powerful

1697
01:11:57,301 --> 01:11:57,510
team.

1698
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:58,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

1699
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:01,950
What is that like?
People want you to be on their fucking,

1700
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,390
your,
your cell phone provider.

1701
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:06,690
They'll get mad if you're not still with
18 tea,

1702
01:12:06,691 --> 01:12:08,160
bro.
I thought you were smarter than that.

1703
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:13,540
You're smarter than that because you 
want to be a 100 percent right and all 

1704
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:13,540
your choices.
Yeah.

1705
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:13,540
Right.
And you know,

1706
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:15,120
in my neighborhood of arises,
not good.

1707
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:18,300
It's a real difference.
It's really like a religious thing.

1708
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:21,600
It's all the same shit.
We're fucked.

1709
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,700
We're stupid.
We're stupid monkey.

1710
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:25,920
That's supposed to have this kind of 
power show fear.

1711
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:27,390
That's the real issue or whatever they 
want.

1712
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:30,310
We're still supposed to be figuring out 
consciousness.

1713
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:30,660
We're,
we're,

1714
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:33,960
we're not supposed to be working on 
nuclear bombs at the stage.

1715
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:38,990
You know,
we're way ahead of ourselves 

1716
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:38,990
technologically.
Right.

1717
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:40,620
Brian,
what are you looking at Brian and trying

1718
01:12:40,621 --> 01:12:41,430
to get this clip for you.

1719
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,540
It was when the song took your watch it 
something have to fucking commercials.

1720
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:47,100
Yeah.
That's just how it goes.

1721
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:48,900
Now you can't watch a youtube clip 
anymore.

1722
01:12:48,901 --> 01:12:53,370
You've got to watch some 30 seconds of 
bullshit for and knowing God it.

1723
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,760
And this is five minutes.
This was five minutes of commercials.

1724
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:59,850
What's it's on team Coco's website.
Wait a minute.

1725
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,880
You have five minutes with commercials 
before you can watch them and I know you

1726
01:13:02,881 --> 01:13:07,881
get to watch like the first,
like $40 after 20 minutes or something 

1727
01:13:07,881 --> 01:13:08,220
like that.
And then they make you watch like a five

1728
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:10,280
minute commercial break.
So they make me do it.

1729
01:13:10,281 --> 01:13:13,560
They do it just like it's too well,
you can't find.

1730
01:13:13,561 --> 01:13:15,580
There's no youtube clips of that or Hulu
from.

1731
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:20,690
Well,
I just have a feeling that the ones I 

1732
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:22,890
will find will cut off before,
I mean at least at least this is sort of

1733
01:13:22,891 --> 01:13:27,540
some sort of an alternative for them to 
be able to advertise on videos and,

1734
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:28,740
and promote these videos.

1735
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:30,230
Getting out there.
I mean if you'll,

1736
01:13:30,231 --> 01:13:33,630
all you have to do is watch some 30 
seconds clip here or there.

1737
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,610
The South Park studios in between 
breaks.

1738
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:38,100
Do they like everyone's mother put a 
32nd commercial.

1739
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:43,430
Not much though.
And they have the kids cursing so it's 

1740
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:43,430
way better.
So Brian,

1741
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:45,390
did you find it online anywhere else 
other than the team?

1742
01:13:45,391 --> 01:13:48,470
Coco website.
Now I heard that uh,

1743
01:13:48,471 --> 01:13:50,880
that show was not doing very well 
ratings wise.

1744
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:56,060
Oh yeah.
Everyone's talking about Washington and 

1745
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:58,470
after people loved Conan O'brien when he
was on NBC in that time slot.

1746
01:13:58,471 --> 01:14:00,990
And for whatever reason why can't they 
follow him?

1747
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:02,870
Was why isn't it the same amount of 
people?

1748
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,310
I think some,
I guess you can Dvr,

1749
01:14:05,311 --> 01:14:07,870
but I feel like those people were,
I don't know,

1750
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,920
people liked liking him.
They liked the idea of like in Conan,

1751
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:12,010
but he would think he didn't

1752
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,610
really watch when he was on earlier.
Really.

1753
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,750
I mean,
they didn't watch.

1754
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:19,060
You can blame it on a lead and all you 
want,

1755
01:14:19,061 --> 01:14:20,440
but those people weren't.
The people weren't watching.

1756
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:21,070
All my friends,
like,

1757
01:14:21,071 --> 01:14:21,880
that's way better than.
I'm like,

1758
01:14:21,881 --> 01:14:25,960
when's the last time you watched it?
It is a weird thing that they had the,

1759
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:30,980
when they did that Jay Leno thing,
when they have the Jay Leno show at 10 

1760
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:31,120
tonight show at 11,
that was wonky.

1761
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:34,430
That was a silly idea.
Got Everybody talking about it is.

1762
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:36,830
Okay.
So it doesn't,

1763
01:14:36,831 --> 01:14:38,940
it doesn't,
it just professionally.

1764
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,880
Worst thing that ever happened to you?
Yeah,

1765
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:42,440
it's um,
it was just,

1766
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:46,430
it was a miserable experience because 
he's out to be in the movie.

1767
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:48,610
I just,
um,

1768
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:53,620
I had,
I was forced at legal point a to spend a

1769
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:59,600
week on a cruise ship and I know you and
your family love going on cruises.

1770
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:00,700
That's all we do.
I know,

1771
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:01,510
I know,
I know.

1772
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:05,350
So I'm not trying to never been on a 
Chris Conan.

1773
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:07,270
Stop it.
It's me.

1774
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:10,950
All right.
Yes,

1775
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:13,800
let's just say I love going on cruises,
fun time,

1776
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:15,050
cruise,
and uh,

1777
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:16,080
you know,
um,

1778
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:18,610
so far it's,
how could they legally,

1779
01:15:18,611 --> 01:15:22,620
why were they legally want to make you 
be on a cruise ship to know?

1780
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:25,510
I don't know.
It was terrible.

1781
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,830
It was.
There was no reason for me to be there.

1782
01:15:27,831 --> 01:15:29,600
If you,
if you see the movie and don't.

1783
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,880
And I mean first of all,
shipwrecked.

1784
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:40,850
It's a punk,
you know,

1785
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:43,480
kids,
five-year-olds love puns.

1786
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:45,430
They love it.
They love wordplay and,

1787
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:51,080
and it,
it's a big commercial for a carnival 

1788
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:51,580
cruise lines is the entire movie.
Yes.

1789
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:54,400
And,
and they thought,

1790
01:15:54,401 --> 01:15:57,340
won't it be fun?
They get David on there and uh,

1791
01:15:57,350 --> 01:16:01,000
and the scenes that take place on the 
cruise ship,

1792
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:06,720
I am always in a Pelican mascot.
Foam rubber outfit where you cannot see 

1793
01:16:08,591 --> 01:16:12,160
any of my flesh,
nor do I have any dialogue.

1794
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:15,870
Well,
wait,

1795
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:18,390
if that's the case,
I'm sure you said to them,

1796
01:16:18,391 --> 01:16:19,410
get a stand,
Dan.

1797
01:16:19,411 --> 01:16:22,810
Get someone else to be in the foam 
rubber costume and take them away on a,

1798
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,070
on a cruise for.
Oh wait,

1799
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:28,550
yes.
I tried that line of logic and reason,

1800
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:34,630
but there was one producer who everybody
else had my back and the director was 

1801
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:34,630
like,
oh,

1802
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:35,120
we don't,
that's fine.

1803
01:16:35,121 --> 01:16:40,121
We don't need them.
And I'm in the middle of Todd Margaret 

1804
01:16:40,121 --> 01:16:40,121
too.
I was in London and,

1805
01:16:40,121 --> 01:16:40,121
and uh,
and,

1806
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:41,450
and they're like,
no,

1807
01:16:41,451 --> 01:16:43,330
you have to go is more like,

1808
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:45,610
and,
and um,

1809
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,260
and there's this

1810
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:53,750
one producer and I won't say who,
but she is the personification of what 

1811
01:16:57,811 --> 01:17:01,320
people think about when they think 
negatively about Jews

1812
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:07,720
give.
You know what,

1813
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:09,560
when people come here,
you're up.

1814
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:10,880
No,
no,

1815
01:17:10,881 --> 01:17:11,300
I don't.

1816
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:17,820
Your show the increasingly poor 
decisions to todd.

1817
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:19,020
Margaret,
very funny show you.

1818
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:24,110
I'm sure you enjoy.
And then there was a cut where even 

1819
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:24,450
conant's arm like moved a little bit 
other than the cut.

1820
01:17:24,451 --> 01:17:26,710
But I definitely saw how comfortable.
No,

1821
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:27,760
I don't care.
Okay.

1822
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:29,490
Yeah.
Wow.

1823
01:17:29,491 --> 01:17:32,460
That was a strong words.
But I wonder if he's really good friends

1824
01:17:32,461 --> 01:17:33,750
with the girl and he's just fucking 
around.

1825
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:39,130
Could be that.
It could be that he was good friends 

1826
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:42,681
with her and that was just a joke.
Bashing a movie that just was released 

1827
01:17:42,681 --> 01:17:42,860
that that person is producing.
I doubt it.

1828
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:46,440
Was He bashing the movie,
you don't see the movie.

1829
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,300
And then he said it's just a big 
commercial for Carnival cruise lines.

1830
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:52,230
Well,
did they make him do the movies that.

1831
01:17:52,231 --> 01:17:54,180
What happened?
Was He contractually obligated to do the

1832
01:17:54,181 --> 01:17:56,100
second film?
I don't know.

1833
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:59,610
He was just pissed about being on that 
boat for a week.

1834
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,370
Know that was a bit.
Yeah.

1835
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,750
I mean,
I don't know.

1836
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:06,350
It didn't offend me at all.
Yeah.

1837
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:11,360
I mean the movie is.
The movie is if you don't say it's for 

1838
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:11,510
five year old,
he's a fun comic.

1839
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,410
It's not for him.
He did a job and it's not,

1840
01:18:13,411 --> 01:18:14,820
it's not his Gig,
you know?

1841
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,560
I'm just saying it was funny.
Yeah.

1842
01:18:16,561 --> 01:18:18,560
No it was.
When he's funny across.

1843
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:20,340
He's fucking hilarious.
Um,

1844
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:25,520
but yeah,
it probably sucks to be him and be one 

1845
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:25,520
of those movies and take all that 
hipster shit.

1846
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,680
Probably like Super Mad at him.
Dude.

1847
01:18:28,681 --> 01:18:33,681
You fucking totally sold out selling out
with the restaurant.

1848
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:36,900
You know what?
I'm going to go look at it.

1849
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:42,050
What is it?
He went off on a heckler than somebody 

1850
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:42,050
would like to alert.
I don't know.

1851
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:46,191
It got weird and some from comic that 
was there a up about it saying I was so 

1852
01:18:46,191 --> 01:18:46,191
fucking weird.

1853
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:47,730
Oh,
I did hear about that.

1854
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,720
He was trying out some new material and 
someone was filming him and he asked the

1855
01:18:51,721 --> 01:18:54,450
lady to stop filming them because he 
didn't want it to get on the Internet,

1856
01:18:54,451 --> 01:18:55,380
which is there,
you know,

1857
01:18:55,750 --> 01:19:00,750
valid.
Especially because he was doing a free 

1858
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:02,301
show.
Do you ever just the bashing afterwards 

1859
01:19:02,301 --> 01:19:02,301
he bashed Peter.
What did he say?

1860
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,170
Just calling her fat and ugly.
Oh,

1861
01:19:04,171 --> 01:19:05,350
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

1862
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:06,690
Oh Wow.
I don't know.

1863
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,640
So I've got uncomfortable,
which is fine.

1864
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,290
That was it.
Did you see it?

1865
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:11,370
No,
my friend did.

1866
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:12,480
He was there and he was like,
yeah,

1867
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:13,650
I was super accountable.
You know,

1868
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,090
you've got,
you've done it before where it's like,

1869
01:19:15,091 --> 01:19:16,380
oh,
I want you to harsh on this girl.

1870
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:17,810
You know,
it's,

1871
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:19,560
we're not 100 percent.
We're guessing like,

1872
01:19:19,561 --> 01:19:20,540
where's the line right now?
Well,

1873
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:25,550
not only that,
you can be angry and lose your 

1874
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:25,550
composure.

1875
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:29,420
A little girlfriend who just said 
something that makes you fucking mad at 

1876
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:30,780
women or it could be the just the 
seventh day in a row.

1877
01:19:30,781 --> 01:19:33,120
We've been heckled.
He can't get through your shit.

1878
01:19:33,121 --> 01:19:34,470
Who knows?
What was it?

1879
01:19:34,471 --> 01:19:37,620
The adjustable woman holding up the 
camera was one girl.

1880
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:38,670
She just had her thing.
She said,

1881
01:19:38,671 --> 01:19:39,070
oh,
sorry,

1882
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:44,100
I'll delete it.
He's saying what you didn't see it was 

1883
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,190
her.
You have to look at it is what you're 

1884
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:46,190
saying.
Which he responded to this comic so that

1885
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:46,530
you were fine.
It was well written and you're funny.

1886
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:47,850
Comic,
some new girl.

1887
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,190
He goes,
well you didn't see us when I asked her,

1888
01:19:50,191 --> 01:19:54,180
shut it off her roll her eyes and mouth 
asshole to her friends.

1889
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:56,670
Well,
you know,

1890
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,650
I,
I see his point of view,

1891
01:19:58,651 --> 01:20:00,120
but I see her,
but she was there and she goes.

1892
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:00,600
He goes,
yeah,

1893
01:20:00,601 --> 01:20:01,200
it's hard to do that.

1894
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,670
That was after he was ripping into her,
like after she said,

1895
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:04,650
I'm so sorry.
I'll turn it off.

1896
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,760
Who knows?
I mean we're just commenting to be 

1897
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:10,760
there,
but I was talking about last night there

1898
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:10,760
was like,
why?

1899
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:11,050
What,
what?

1900
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,720
Why do some people not able to just say 
like,

1901
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,580
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1902
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:14,940
it wasn't the,
that wasn't the best.

1903
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:15,740
Well,
some people,

1904
01:20:15,741 --> 01:20:18,160
every one of them are wrong and it's 
something never really young too.

1905
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:19,830
It's okay.
Well,

1906
01:20:19,831 --> 01:20:21,240
it could be.
Who knows?

1907
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:26,270
Who knows?
But we'd have to hear him talk about it 

1908
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:26,270
and talk.
I mean,

1909
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:28,200
yeah,
we would have to actually see a video to

1910
01:20:28,201 --> 01:20:33,201
fucking tell the truth.
Really would to be able to decipher for 

1911
01:20:33,201 --> 01:20:34,010
ourselves and I don't really get into 
it.

1912
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,280
Now.
Don't care at all.

1913
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:36,960
Did you see what happened with Stan 
Hope?

1914
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:42,470
Well,
the kid stole his shit and was like 

1915
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:42,990
literally verbatim putting standup bits 
on his blog.

1916
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:45,960
Really if he's this fucking thing in 
front of a camera.

1917
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:47,130
No,
wrote it.

1918
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:51,180
Wrote it on the little articles,
his blog entries.

1919
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:53,000
Oh my God.
Stand up.

1920
01:20:53,001 --> 01:20:55,020
When I went after him with the power of 
thor,

1921
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:57,300
Stan hope went onto his,
uh,

1922
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:02,280
his facebook page and posted in every 
photo on his facebook page.

1923
01:21:02,281 --> 01:21:03,390
You're a fraud,
you know,

1924
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,580
like little jokes about him being a 
fraud.

1925
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:11,030
Stan hope put it up on twitter.
So of course the swarms of human beings 

1926
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:15,351
who went to this guy's website and the 
guy had comments up on his website and 

1927
01:21:15,351 --> 01:21:17,070
his comments were just filled with 
people saying,

1928
01:21:17,071 --> 01:21:18,460
you rip it off,
Doug Stanhope,

1929
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,670
you fucking hack you this,
you that,

1930
01:21:20,671 --> 01:21:23,910
and just torturing this poor guy.
Stand up.

1931
01:21:23,911 --> 01:21:25,860
Did it for hours,
for hours.

1932
01:21:25,861 --> 01:21:30,480
He just had just fucking just going 
after this poor fuck.

1933
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:33,050
The guy apparently is a comic,
you know,

1934
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,730
he just tries to,
tries to be Mr.

1935
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:38,490
Cool Guy.
And yeah,

1936
01:21:38,491 --> 01:21:39,430
he tried to be Mr.
Cool.

1937
01:21:39,431 --> 01:21:44,431
Guy and steel.
Doug hopes material and pass it off as 

1938
01:21:44,431 --> 01:21:45,540
his own getting tortured.
Oh my God.

1939
01:21:45,541 --> 01:21:50,541
He's done.
He had to pull his facebook the next 

1940
01:21:50,541 --> 01:21:50,541
day,
his facebook and his blog.

1941
01:21:50,541 --> 01:21:54,471
We're both down screenshots of it all 
and there's a facebook page all about 

1942
01:21:54,471 --> 01:21:54,471
it.
I forget the name relates,

1943
01:21:54,471 --> 01:21:55,680
but page where it shows like,
you know,

1944
01:21:55,681 --> 01:22:00,681
like that could save the Stan hope wrote
on each photo instead.

1945
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:02,730
Hope road,
some funny shit.

1946
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,140
Well he,
his,

1947
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:05,100
his,
his dad.

1948
01:22:05,101 --> 01:22:07,920
I wonder how sad his father would be if 
he knew his son was a fraud.

1949
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:12,630
It's just standing up,
just kept going after the guy,

1950
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:13,530
but the,
you know,

1951
01:22:13,531 --> 01:22:17,550
the guy's like so retarded.
Like the way he did it was so dumb.

1952
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:22,770
Just copied a famous comedians work.
That's what you're going to do.

1953
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:27,940
You know,
you want to come off as like a guy who 

1954
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:27,940
really mean.

1955
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:29,370
Did you think that somehow or another no
one is going to be okay.

1956
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:34,460
It's okay because people are reading it 
instead of a college for the to pass 

1957
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,220
grades,
right.

1958
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:42,710
I'll just copy someone else's work.
They can't do that anymore now because 

1959
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:45,951
if you have a file,
there's programs now that they can run 

1960
01:22:45,951 --> 01:22:47,700
that file through and it'll recognize 
plagiarism,

1961
01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:52,701
but I wasn't trying to say like,
like I didn't want any recognition for 

1962
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:52,701
what I've done.
Right.

1963
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:53,010
Yeah,
of course.

1964
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:55,050
You're just wanting to get out of your 
situation.

1965
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:58,800
You're just forced spot.
There's software now to just.

1966
01:22:59,010 --> 01:22:59,700
Wow.
Yeah.

1967
01:22:59,701 --> 01:23:01,490
There's software online software will 
be.

1968
01:23:01,491 --> 01:23:05,740
They find duplicates of your work.
A teachers had that.

1969
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:07,000
Yeah.
Oh,

1970
01:23:07,001 --> 01:23:07,630
you're fuck.
No.

1971
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:09,030
My Buddy John Wilbert,
my,

1972
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,440
my brother in law now I guess actually 
brother in law's brother,

1973
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:15,730
but he copied word for word out of cliff
notes one day and the teacher was like,

1974
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,760
you copied this one because I can the 
same exact paragraph does not a word 

1975
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:21,070
changed.
He just stuck to his story.

1976
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:21,670
He was like,
nope.

1977
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:22,700
Nope,
sure.

1978
01:23:22,701 --> 01:23:25,390
Didn't know I made that up.
Wow.

1979
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,330
Because goes this entire paragraph.
There's not a word changed.

1980
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:30,460
Well,
you know,

1981
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:32,650
if he's,
if he's that confident.

1982
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:37,360
Nope.
What kind of a teacher is that?

1983
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:42,480
It was,
it was one of the nondual teachers be 

1984
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:42,480
bused in.
Oh,

1985
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:42,480
one of the non Jewish teacher.
So they couldn't hang.

1986
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:44,230
I think eventually she was like,
fine,

1987
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:45,310
whatever.
What was it like?

1988
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,320
Just they couldn't deal with the Jewish 
men.

1989
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:48,250
Well,
it was probably like,

1990
01:23:48,251 --> 01:23:49,060
look at this Brat.

1991
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:54,110
He refused to admit it.
I don't give a shit then fucking copy 

1992
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:57,850
for the rest of your life.
But the Jewish teachers would come down 

1993
01:23:57,850 --> 01:23:57,850
on you for sure.
Like that.

1994
01:23:57,850 --> 01:23:59,320
Is that what you said?
Non Jewish Jewish.

1995
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:01,690
The non Jewish ones we just didn't 
respect.

1996
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:02,620
Really?
Yeah,

1997
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:04,690
they just didn't have our.
How can we could run over them.

1998
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:08,620
I don't know.
There was some teachers use all agreed.

1999
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:11,710
We're not going to respect you really 
year after year.

2000
01:24:11,711 --> 01:24:13,870
Everyone makes the same agreement.
Nobody talks about it.

2001
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,750
There's some teachers like you don't 
fuck with rabbit Krakauer.

2002
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,280
Yeah.
What was that man?

2003
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:23,281
What is it that some kids just like 
certain teachers and everybody gets 

2004
01:24:23,281 --> 01:24:23,281
along great.
I don't know.

2005
01:24:23,281 --> 01:24:26,650
It might be like hidden like nonverbal 
cues are giving out or you know,

2006
01:24:26,651 --> 01:24:28,930
I have no idea.
There's weak teachers,

2007
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:34,090
strong teachers.
They all the same curriculum to teach 

2008
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:34,090
what that is.

2009
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:35,680
Got To be the biggest fucking problem 
with this country.

2010
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:38,050
It's got to be the biggest problem is 
how kids go to school,

2011
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,130
the education system,
you know,

2012
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:45,440
coming out of it with your fucking head 
together and try to decipher all the 

2013
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,560
nonsense stupidity and programming and 
the idea that you know,

2014
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:55,150
no one ever gets pushed into our field.
No one ever.

2015
01:24:55,151 --> 01:24:56,720
No one ever says,
you know what are.

2016
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:59,860
You're always cracking jokes in class.
You're a funny guy.

2017
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:04,861
You obviously need attention.
If you had thought about going to an 

2018
01:25:04,861 --> 01:25:04,861
open mic night,
no one's ever said that to you.

2019
01:25:04,861 --> 01:25:06,510
Have you thought about maybe being a 
standup comedian?

2020
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:07,570
Yeah.
No.

2021
01:25:07,571 --> 01:25:12,571
You have to get some job somewhere.
Some jobs do stupid when you were doing 

2022
01:25:12,571 --> 01:25:12,571
it for a little while.
There's still a come on.

2023
01:25:12,571 --> 01:25:15,340
How much longer?
The preparation for a shit existence.

2024
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:17,110
That's the worst part about it,
man.

2025
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:22,380
The worst part about it is it kind of 
breaks your soul when you go through 

2026
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:22,480
shit,
boring classes in school,

2027
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:27,630
it breaks your soul for the idea that 
you're prepares you for the idea that 

2028
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:27,640
you're always gonna.
Have let a teacher.

2029
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:32,700
He taught modern American lit and his 
deal was this.

2030
01:25:32,741 --> 01:25:37,741
He goes,
you will never have to know anything 

2031
01:25:37,741 --> 01:25:39,661
about what Joseph Conrad wrote.
What you were learning here with a 

2032
01:25:39,661 --> 01:25:40,180
bachelor of arts is how to get reports 
done on time.

2033
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:41,920
Whoa,
because that's it.

2034
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:43,540
That's all you're learning.
Jesus.

2035
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,550
You're not gonna have to apply any of 
this fitzgerald.

2036
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:47,080
When is that going to come in your 
regular life?

2037
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:48,880
Never.
We're gonna have to learn.

2038
01:25:48,881 --> 01:25:50,010
When I say 9:00
on Tuesday,

2039
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:52,840
have it on my desk,
that's all they're preparing you for.

2040
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:55,990
Why is right on really large degree.
Yeah.

2041
01:25:55,991 --> 01:26:00,991
He is a ride for sure.
I mean that is what ultimately it is 

2042
01:26:00,991 --> 01:26:00,991
the,
the,

2043
01:26:00,991 --> 01:26:00,991
the,
that's what's getting measured,

2044
01:26:00,991 --> 01:26:02,510
you know?
Yeah.

2045
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,070
You can't measure how much you're 
learning.

2046
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:09,280
You measure how much,
how well you're doing on tests and how 

2047
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:09,850
much effort you're putting into your,
your paper.

2048
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:14,060
Are there measurements supposed to be.
You're just were lazy as fuck.

2049
01:26:14,061 --> 01:26:16,430
We want to make sure you're doing your 
work and not only that,

2050
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:21,580
it's not just about educating people.
It's about educating people and 

2051
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:21,860
preparing them for work,
you know,

2052
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:26,861
because that's really what it's all 
about and there's a certain amount of 

2053
01:26:26,861 --> 01:26:26,990
discipline that you're just not going to
have.

2054
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:32,260
How would you feel to get it like a 
creative kid and nurture them from the 

2055
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:32,260
start?
Fucking hard man.

2056
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:33,830
The schools really.
I mean they know they have art,

2057
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:34,640
right?
Well,

2058
01:26:34,641 --> 01:26:39,641
you know,
we gotta we boxed ourselves into a bad 

2059
01:26:39,641 --> 01:26:40,220
situation as a species,
as a race,

2060
01:26:40,221 --> 01:26:41,780
as a,
as a civilization,

2061
01:26:41,781 --> 01:26:45,650
because we need a lot of people doing 
shit that sucks.

2062
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:46,250
Oh yeah.

2063
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:51,310
It's not like as a child,
like you're groomed into a world of 

2064
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:55,310
happiness and prosperity and fulfillment
and know there's a lot.

2065
01:26:55,340 --> 01:27:00,340
There's a maze and there's a fucking 
million pitfalls and million jobs that 

2066
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,610
you can get into that I'm not going to 
be satisfying to you.

2067
01:27:01,611 --> 01:27:03,410
You need to have to figure your way 
through those.

2068
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:05,210
We need people.
We need someone.

2069
01:27:05,211 --> 01:27:07,410
We need war machines,
different.

2070
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:12,420
Meet him.
When you're trying to explain to them 

2071
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:12,420
why they're wrong or misguided,
you realize they're so stupid.

2072
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:16,890
I don't.
I have to rethink how I'm going to 

2073
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:16,890
express this to you.
Well,

2074
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:19,661
the stuff that you've done,
some people just don't have enough 

2075
01:27:19,661 --> 01:27:19,661
information in their head and they,
you know,

2076
01:27:19,661 --> 01:27:20,900
their,
their view of the world is very limited.

2077
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:24,000
I've met very few stupid people have met
a lot of uninsured.

2078
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:26,960
I shouldn't say I met very few people,
but much more.

2079
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:29,120
More people are uninspired than our 
stupid.

2080
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:31,610
There's definitely stupid people though.
It must be like explaining stuff.

2081
01:27:31,611 --> 01:27:34,250
Your kid now,
because kids get things,

2082
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,410
kids get things,
they don't have anything.

2083
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,020
No kids get things and they bring it up 
the next day.

2084
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:43,240
They have questions about the next day,
like they're pondering an idea the kit.

2085
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:44,210
It's not.
Yeah,

2086
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:47,720
they don't have any prior programming 
that you have to fuck with.

2087
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,410
The real problem is a person who grew 
their whole life and,

2088
01:27:51,450 --> 01:27:53,810
and,
and in their mind developed.

2089
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:56,260
It's ridiculous.
Just stuck and I'm like,

2090
01:27:56,300 --> 01:28:01,300
you know,
you get some poor guy who was a fucking 

2091
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:03,491
fundamentalist Christian,
one of those crazy speaking in tongues 

2092
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:03,491
guys,
you know,

2093
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:07,420
and at 40 years old he's just starting 
to branch out on his own and escape is 

2094
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:09,210
his former family.
What are the guys last chances?

2095
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:12,170
Good luck being able to do it because 
yeah,

2096
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:12,710
if you.

2097
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:16,370
But if you got that guy when he was a 
baby and brought them up in a reasonable

2098
01:28:16,371 --> 01:28:21,371
household where people are logical and 
loving and kind of like gave him a sort 

2099
01:28:21,371 --> 01:28:23,300
of a,
a helpful boost,

2100
01:28:23,301 --> 01:28:24,290
but let them know,
hey man,

2101
01:28:24,291 --> 01:28:26,690
this is a crazy world and nobody 
understands it.

2102
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:30,350
They play with close to the people you 
love and enjoy yourself if you can,

2103
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:35,710
you know,
it was really say with autistic kids 

2104
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:35,710
like early to get them to more normal as
you can make them really,

2105
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,250
you got to get them fully set in 
patterns.

2106
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:42,120
There's something to do with autistic 
kids and you know,

2107
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:44,720
whatever it is that's causing that.
And there has to be.

2108
01:28:44,721 --> 01:28:46,190
I mean,
it's a very unpopular opinion,

2109
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:51,430
but there has to be something to do with
autistic kids and the next stage of 

2110
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:52,250
human evolution.
What do you mean has to be.

2111
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:54,610
Because there's so many people that are 
[inaudible].

2112
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:58,680
So many people that have autism or 
development or thought.

2113
01:28:58,830 --> 01:29:03,830
I think what they're experiencing with 
these people were experiencing for 

2114
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:04,710
whatever reason because of their 
disease,

2115
01:29:05,390 --> 01:29:06,300
um,
what,

2116
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:06,890
you know,
and not,

2117
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:09,030
not all of them can do this,
but the few that can,

2118
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:14,270
there's so many of them.
There's so many super genius autistic 

2119
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:14,270
kids.
I mean,

2120
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:14,760
there's a million videos.
You can look at them,

2121
01:29:14,761 --> 01:29:19,761
I'm exaggerating obviously,
but there's a lot of videos you can go 

2122
01:29:19,761 --> 01:29:22,371
online and there's the one kid that we 
talked about that can look out the 

2123
01:29:22,371 --> 01:29:24,180
window of a plane and draw the exact 
scene perfectly.

2124
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:26,070
I mean,
he could just memorize things.

2125
01:29:26,071 --> 01:29:28,470
There's,
there's people that can do very,

2126
01:29:28,471 --> 01:29:30,870
very complex mathematics at a really 
young age.

2127
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:35,871
There's a kid that's a,
he's got something like asperger's or 

2128
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:36,540
something and he says this incredible 
composer.

2129
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:40,060
He's composed like five symphonies and 
he's like 11 years old or something,

2130
01:29:40,061 --> 01:29:42,420
nuts,
asperger's and things out of the store.

2131
01:29:42,421 --> 01:29:44,850
And all he does is make it socially 
uncomfortable for everyone.

2132
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:50,480
Well,
maybe it's no one ever put a fucking 

2133
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:50,480
pair of drumsticks and that kids.
And maybe you get that motherfucker on a

2134
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,090
drum kit,
but I,

2135
01:29:51,091 --> 01:29:56,091
I,
when you see something that's hyper 

2136
01:29:56,091 --> 01:29:58,431
human and it's also attached to a 
disease belt webbing for Walter World,

2137
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:03,060
right between their toddlers and shit's 
moving forward.

2138
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:04,770
Yeah,
I mean I wonder,

2139
01:30:04,771 --> 01:30:09,771
I wonder what it is,
but when you see people capable of 

2140
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:13,071
incredible feats and they also have this
incredible emotional and psychological 

2141
01:30:13,351 --> 01:30:14,310
impairment,
you know,

2142
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:17,110
this inability to communicate and 
connect with people or what,

2143
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:18,960
or whatever it is that they have,
whatever,

2144
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:20,760
you know,
personal kink they have.

2145
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:23,480
But to also have this superpower that's 
a,

2146
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:24,390
it's amazing man.

2147
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:29,540
It's amazing when you watch those shows,
like whenever they have like an a and e 

2148
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:32,631
show or something,
when they feature a bunch of people who 

2149
01:30:32,631 --> 01:30:32,631
can do like ridiculous shit.
You know,

2150
01:30:32,631 --> 01:30:36,681
there's,
there's some people that literally are 

2151
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:36,681
another thing.
They're like,

2152
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:37,980
they have a little bit of the new thing 
in them,

2153
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:43,370
you know,
and I wonder how many more of them we 

2154
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:44,230
have now than just 100 years ago.
You know,

2155
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:49,240
I wonder how many more people are born.
I mean there's obviously like super 

2156
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:50,880
geniuses always.
There's always been guys like Tesla,

2157
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:51,760
you know,
and,

2158
01:30:51,761 --> 01:30:56,761
and,
and Stephen Hawking and due to that 

2159
01:30:56,761 --> 01:30:56,761
nature alive.
Yeah.

2160
01:30:56,761 --> 01:30:56,761
That's crazy,
isn't it?

2161
01:30:56,761 --> 01:31:01,020
Yeah.
Just people will go fuck them up.

2162
01:31:01,070 --> 01:31:03,030
It's not like it came out feeling fine.
Yeah.

2163
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:08,240
But like he's still alive.
He's alive and making computations with 

2164
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:11,070
his fingers.
That no idea.

2165
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:14,370
When I heard about patrice not being 
able to talk before he went,

2166
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,390
it was like,
oh,

2167
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:16,520
that's,
that's who he is.

2168
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:19,020
That's everything I know about him.
It revolves around his mouth.

2169
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:20,850
Yeah.
That's horrible.

2170
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:23,820
This guys figured out a way to do 
something.

2171
01:31:23,821 --> 01:31:25,710
Wow.
Keep it going to keep it going.

2172
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,320
He,
you ever seen his fingers move?

2173
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:31,820
He knows and he clicks on this thing and
he can kind of moves and,

2174
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:34,860
and chooses words from this screen.
It's really amazing.

2175
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:37,260
It's amazing that all that junk.
I don't know.

2176
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,610
That's a good question.
I don't know.

2177
01:31:38,611 --> 01:31:41,760
I don't think so.
Oh yeah.

2178
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:47,540
Don't want to downplay the wonder.
I wonder what keeps a dude like that 

2179
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:51,000
moving on because there has to be some 
form of enjoyment for him as well.

2180
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:55,020
He must be enjoying some something 
about.

2181
01:31:55,021 --> 01:31:56,820
Yeah,
his science career,

2182
01:31:56,821 --> 01:32:01,821
you know,
your clear like biological imperatives 

2183
01:32:01,821 --> 01:32:01,821
is

2184
01:32:01,821 --> 01:32:02,020
to continue life,
so he's like,

2185
01:32:02,090 --> 01:32:06,550
I have to have some reason to do that.
Stay alive.

2186
01:32:06,551 --> 01:32:07,090
Yeah,
it must be.

2187
01:32:07,091 --> 01:32:09,790
It must get fulfillment out of it.
Finding out new show or writing a book,

2188
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:13,810
just like anybody want a strange 
situation man.

2189
01:32:13,811 --> 01:32:17,980
To be trapped in your body like that and
doing computations with your fingers and

2190
01:32:17,981 --> 01:32:18,610
this thing.
Click,

2191
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:19,210
click,
click,

2192
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:19,960
click,
click,

2193
01:32:19,961 --> 01:32:20,350
click,
click,

2194
01:32:20,351 --> 01:32:23,410
click.
Whose phone is next to the computer?

2195
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:25,830
Because the thing keeps going.
Take to the addicted it.

2196
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:28,900
Is it your phone Brian next to your 
computer,

2197
01:32:28,901 --> 01:32:29,380
right?
Yeah.

2198
01:32:29,381 --> 01:32:31,390
It's not the computer.
There is nothing to do with the sound.

2199
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:32,190
You sure?
Yeah.

2200
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:37,740
Well it doesn't sound.
Come through that computer have 

2201
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:37,740
completely muted.
It's completely muted.

2202
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:39,820
I don't think it has to do with the 
mute.

2203
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:42,670
I think it's the electricity doesn't 
radio.

2204
01:32:42,671 --> 01:32:45,210
Sometimes it's not the matter of the 
computer being muted.

2205
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:46,920
It is because you have the phone next to
the computer.

2206
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:48,750
It's like picking up a signal.
Yeah.

2207
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:54,180
It's not a mute thing.
It's not like it's coming through like 

2208
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:56,611
a,
like a sound so that when you're 

2209
01:32:56,611 --> 01:32:56,730
shooting sometimes they'll turn your 
phones off or on mute off.

2210
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:57,880
We were getting feedback.
Yeah.

2211
01:32:57,881 --> 01:32:59,180
It goes d to d,
two to.

2212
01:32:59,270 --> 01:33:02,500
It'll do it in your car sometimes too.
There's an illegal right nearest area.

2213
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:06,280
If you have like a stereo for where your
cds or something didn't leave it there.

2214
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:07,330
It'll.
It's real close.

2215
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:12,360
It'll.
It'll find through how fucked is that 

2216
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:12,360
man?
How far does this signal that's having a

2217
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:16,681
war inside your car have the battle and 
for dominance and meanwhile these were 

2218
01:33:16,681 --> 01:33:21,061
all bouncing around and the reason they 
tell you to turn your phones off on the 

2219
01:33:21,061 --> 01:33:21,061
plan?
Is that it?

2220
01:33:21,061 --> 01:33:21,820
I think so because if everyone's doing 
that,

2221
01:33:21,821 --> 01:33:22,870
it could really come through it.

2222
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:27,930
Make sense?
Phones make sense or what doesn't make 

2223
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:28,180
sense?
Like ipods.

2224
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,430
That doesn't make sense.
That seems silly,

2225
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,140
but you know what?
Whatever.

2226
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:37,290
I think it's an.
It's an exercise in getting people to 

2227
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:39,331
pay attention to rules.
It's just like moving your seat just to 

2228
01:33:39,331 --> 01:33:39,940
get you ready for the.
For the otherwise.

2229
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:44,950
How.
How do three older women control an 

2230
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:45,040
entire full of people?
It's like,

2231
01:33:45,041 --> 01:33:46,510
listen,
I want to fall asleep now.

2232
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:51,540
I don't want to turn it back on.
I'm going to listen to music the whole 

2233
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:51,540
time.
Can I just fall asleep with it in?

2234
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:55,840
Can't gonna kill us all.
I got caught on that.

2235
01:33:55,841 --> 01:33:57,700
Easy to kill people.
If all you gotta do is like,

2236
01:33:57,701 --> 01:34:00,670
keep an ipod on the plane would fall out
of the fucking sky.

2237
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:01,390
I don't know.
The ultimate.

2238
01:34:01,391 --> 01:34:06,391
His little jokes.
That's what happened to space shutter 

2239
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:06,391
space shuttle.

2240
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:08,710
All Jewish couple in the back.
I had the tray table down for the kosher

2241
01:34:08,711 --> 01:34:11,230
meal and now you cannot take off with 
the kosher meal.

2242
01:34:11,231 --> 01:34:13,330
Tray down.
Yeah.

2243
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:20,280
It's a weird thing that you could 
actually even tell people that if you 

2244
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,160
had your phone on it could be in danger.
Like,

2245
01:34:21,161 --> 01:34:23,200
well,
let's fix that.

2246
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:25,120
Fix that.
You know,

2247
01:34:25,121 --> 01:34:27,400
those 83 ads.
There was an article today.

2248
01:34:27,401 --> 01:34:29,040
I think I retweeted it.
Those,

2249
01:34:29,050 --> 01:34:29,870
uh,
eight,

2250
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:35,190
eight,
three ads are showing cracks on the 

2251
01:34:35,190 --> 01:34:35,190
wings.
Really?

2252
01:34:35,190 --> 01:34:35,190
Yeah.
Ones are built.

2253
01:34:35,190 --> 01:34:36,370
How long?
I'll tell you right now.

2254
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,230
Well,
there's apparently there's a,

2255
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:42,010
one of them was a quantas jet and two 
other ones.

2256
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:42,910
Where you.
Yeah,

2257
01:34:42,911 --> 01:34:43,620
with you.
Oh,

2258
01:34:43,630 --> 01:34:44,270
that's right.
Yeah.

2259
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:47,440
Yeah.
World's biggest super jumbo jets must be

2260
01:34:47,441 --> 01:34:52,441
grounded.
Say engineers after cracks or founded 

2261
01:34:52,441 --> 01:34:54,741
the wings of three Airbus a three,
eight s cracks are some of the worst 

2262
01:34:54,741 --> 01:34:54,741
things you can find me.
Yeah.

2263
01:34:54,741 --> 01:34:57,860
I would say to Singapore Air Super 
Jumbos and one quantas.

2264
01:34:57,861 --> 01:34:58,100
Both

2265
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,620
Airlines admit the cracks,
but say the planes are safe.

2266
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:04,490
What is their quote?
Oh God,

2267
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:07,550
are you out of your mind?
This is amazing.

2268
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:10,850
This is a huge fucking planes.
When Ari and I flew in it,

2269
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:12,830
it's like flying in a giant apartment 
building.

2270
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:18,250
That's weird.
There was like we sat in the front and 

2271
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:20,270
there was a second floor we could like 
go upstairs to the bar,

2272
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:23,150
so there's actually a bar that you can 
sit at the bar.

2273
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:24,680
There's a bar.
That's cool.

2274
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:29,740
Yeah.
There was a bar and they had like 

2275
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:31,331
magazines out and shit and they would 
just serve you food or drink whatever 

2276
01:35:31,331 --> 01:35:33,170
you wanted the entire time you're there.
It was ridiculous.

2277
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:33,810
It's the,
the,

2278
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:35,860
the,
the thing that you get in first class is

2279
01:35:35,861 --> 01:35:37,220
like,
it's like an apartment.

2280
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:39,230
It's huge,
it's enormous.

2281
01:35:39,231 --> 01:35:44,231
It spins your seat,
spins like it goes straight if you want 

2282
01:35:44,231 --> 01:35:46,490
to lie down or he turned sideways and it
can be like a lazy boy and then you have

2283
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:48,740
this big ass flat screen tv in front of 
you.

2284
01:35:48,741 --> 01:35:53,060
I mean it's ridiculous and the food is 
really fucking good.

2285
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:56,080
It's like most airline food sucks,
but like,

2286
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:59,630
like Quantas firstclass fucking good 
meals,

2287
01:35:59,631 --> 01:36:02,690
man.
It's Yummy food and you're 30,000

2288
01:36:02,691 --> 01:36:05,840
feet above the ocean hurling through the
sky in a metal tube.

2289
01:36:05,850 --> 01:36:09,710
It ain't like south west eight course 
tasting menu they had.

2290
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:12,930
It was so delicious and great man.
You Got Pajamas?

2291
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:14,220
Yeah.
You get pajamas.

2292
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:15,330
Toothpaste.
Shit.

2293
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:17,050
I turned it off on the plane.
Did you really?

2294
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:20,460
Here's what you got to do because the 
pot is not completely enclosed.

2295
01:36:20,550 --> 01:36:24,900
So if any rich people listening,
you don't turn your body towards.

2296
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:26,670
I'm a way.
I mean from the,

2297
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:31,700
from the opening,
you have to turn towards it because 

2298
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:31,700
you're always worried.
Like somebody might be coming up.

2299
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:33,000
We turn so you can see them come through
the netting,

2300
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:38,390
right,
because they could see down there 

2301
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:39,871
beating on her,
beating off to put my head by where my 

2302
01:36:39,871 --> 01:36:40,310
dick would be.
I looked at the lady behind me,

2303
01:36:40,311 --> 01:36:43,260
like who could get an angle at it?
She was asleep,

2304
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:44,580
so I was like,
okay.

2305
01:36:44,610 --> 01:36:45,840
How much time do you think you took?

2306
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,420
Probably probably it was probably a 
little longer.

2307
01:36:48,450 --> 01:36:50,820
Probably like two to four minutes to 
four minutes.

2308
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:54,790
Were you furious or thought?
And then we'll stop.

2309
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:59,810
You have real gentle,
but based on the lefthand and jerker on 

2310
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:00,090
that with the right does,
you were doing,

2311
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:05,100
you know,
because I was on the right side of the 

2312
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,111
plane.
It's probably good for your core as 

2313
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:06,111
well.
Just put yourself in that way.

2314
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:06,480
We'll just,
you don't fall over.

2315
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:08,580
And then would you shoot it into your 
Pajama tops?

2316
01:37:08,610 --> 01:37:09,500
No,
uh,

2317
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:12,390
I shot it into the um,
the slipper socks,

2318
01:37:12,391 --> 01:37:15,090
like if you turn one of those inside out
and shot it into it.

2319
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:20,310
And then a horse,
like a peasant to use my regular socks.

2320
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:24,600
I was on a plane once with Melanie 
Griffith and we're flying to England.

2321
01:37:24,601 --> 01:37:29,601
She was sitting right in front of me and
there was a dude who was right beside 

2322
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:32,931
her and you know how when planes in the 
first class cabin there seats don't line

2323
01:37:33,061 --> 01:37:38,061
up like everyone's not head to toe.
They're kind of staggered because of 

2324
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:39,240
these big ass pods.
Well,

2325
01:37:39,241 --> 01:37:44,241
the way it was staggered was Melanie 
Griffith head lined up directly with 

2326
01:37:44,251 --> 01:37:49,251
this fat guys asked,
was right across the aisle no more than 

2327
01:37:49,251 --> 01:37:53,811
a couple of feet away.
Her head directly lined up with his ass 

2328
01:37:53,811 --> 01:37:57,280
and he unloaded this dude unloaded in 
the middle of the flight.

2329
01:37:57,430 --> 01:38:01,290
One of the most horrific hate like farts
are friend tate.

2330
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:03,570
Fletcher is known for having the most 
ferocious far.

2331
01:38:03,571 --> 01:38:08,571
It's because pizza big giant dude and he
takes a lot of protein powder and when 

2332
01:38:08,571 --> 01:38:12,201
you eat a lot of protein like your body,
like rid of it because it's kind of a 

2333
01:38:12,201 --> 01:38:12,201
process.

2334
01:38:12,201 --> 01:38:12,450
That extra shit.
Well,

2335
01:38:12,451 --> 01:38:15,590
and it turns into farts.
And this dude just.

2336
01:38:15,591 --> 01:38:16,950
I mean,
I don't know what he ate,

2337
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:22,180
but he was a big guy and by the way,
I don't even know if it was his fault 

2338
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:22,890
because it's not like I have a fucking 
locator,

2339
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:26,940
but if you're on a plane and there's a 
fart and you see a fat guy,

2340
01:38:26,941 --> 01:38:29,430
that guy gets blamed.
He blamed you,

2341
01:38:29,431 --> 01:38:34,350
gets blamed more than like black kids 
get blamed for stolen things.

2342
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:36,600
Fad people get blamed for farts on 
planes.

2343
01:38:36,601 --> 01:38:39,330
Always like,
that's like the first person you look to

2344
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:40,070
like,
fuck yeah,

2345
01:38:40,071 --> 01:38:45,071
it was him and the way it lined up,
it was just his ass was just right 

2346
01:38:45,071 --> 01:38:45,600
across from her face.
It was horrific,

2347
01:38:45,601 --> 01:38:47,190
man.
I mean it was a.

2348
01:38:47,370 --> 01:38:49,110
It was a nightmare.
Fart.

2349
01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:54,410
And what are the odds in life that you 
would ever have your face or Melanie 

2350
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,130
Griffith face that close to your ass.

2351
01:38:56,580 --> 01:39:00,900
You could unload on her face like that 
on her face.

2352
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:06,260
I talked about it on stage that night in
England because it was so ridiculous 

2353
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:08,550
because I just.
It was just such a preposterous lineup.

2354
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:12,480
What I can never turn it into a bit,
but it was really hilarious at the time.

2355
01:39:12,481 --> 01:39:13,800
I just,
I couldn't imagine.

2356
01:39:14,310 --> 01:39:15,360
Well,
and I was thinking,

2357
01:39:15,361 --> 01:39:20,361
what if this guy had planned this out?
What I feel like came to melanie 

2358
01:39:20,361 --> 01:39:20,361
griffiths agent and he said,
listen,

2359
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:23,070
I'd be willing to pay a million dollars 
to fart and ms Dot Griffin.

2360
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:25,590
I'm like,
you're out of your fucking mind.

2361
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:27,480
You know,
we can't bring your offer to her.

2362
01:39:27,690 --> 01:39:29,650
Bring it to them and they wouldn't do 
that.

2363
01:39:29,710 --> 01:39:30,810
Then the agent said,
listen,

2364
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:36,200
I think we can work something out.
I've been looking at how these planes 

2365
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:36,200
line up and this is what I want to show 
you.

2366
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:37,110
Look at it.
Here's your seat.

2367
01:39:37,111 --> 01:39:38,180
Here's Melanie Griffith.
See,

2368
01:39:38,530 --> 01:39:40,850
look when you're acerbate liquid.
We got.

2369
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:42,540
I think we got it.
I think we got a melody.

2370
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:47,541
Doesn't even have to know.
Is that a little unethical to keeping 

2371
01:39:47,541 --> 01:39:47,541
the money from Melanie?
I mean that's part of my thrill.

2372
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:48,100
Well,
you know,

2373
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:49,620
I'll just slip it into her bank account.
No,

2374
01:39:49,621 --> 01:39:54,621
he doesn't have to know.
I just a little extra money in her bank 

2375
01:39:54,621 --> 01:39:57,861
account and it just opened his ass on 
Melanie's head was hot.

2376
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:02,910
It was a hot far for sure.
There was some heat to it.

2377
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:08,090
That was one way.
You might not have known how bad it was 

2378
01:40:08,090 --> 01:40:08,090
before you let it go,
but once you let it go,

2379
01:40:08,090 --> 01:40:12,270
you realized how atrocious what a 
terrible person you are,

2380
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:17,510
but you should be despised.
Think about all the shit particles from 

2381
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:21,021
your ass and people were forced to 
acknowledge and their nostrils word,

2382
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:24,330
word or we have one of those crazy 
positive Brazil.

2383
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:26,550
I don't know.
I don't know what it's going to be like.

2384
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:28,050
Oh,
he's going to Brazil with me.

2385
01:40:28,110 --> 01:40:29,940
We're going to party.
You're going to party in Rio.

2386
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:34,620
Apparently it's the nuttiest crowd for 
mma ever.

2387
01:40:34,621 --> 01:40:36,960
Like you've never seen a more brilliant 
and they're all broadly on the car.

2388
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:39,870
Lot of Brazilians in the card and a good
ones.

2389
01:40:39,871 --> 01:40:41,730
Who some are.
Paul Perez is fighting.

2390
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:43,590
That's a fucking great fight,
man.

2391
01:40:43,591 --> 01:40:46,020
That's going to be interesting and it 
must go nuts for it.

2392
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:47,640
Although fighting Chad Mendez,
man,

2393
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:49,650
I wouldn't want to be Chad Mendez in 
Brazil.

2394
01:40:49,890 --> 01:40:51,360
She's Christ.
Although,

2395
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:53,470
although in Anderson,
you know,

2396
01:40:53,471 --> 01:40:54,700
like heroes,
there are heroes.

2397
01:40:54,701 --> 01:40:55,330
There are heroes.
Well,

2398
01:40:55,331 --> 01:40:56,890
there are two of three.
I mean it's really.

2399
01:40:56,891 --> 01:41:01,240
There's no country like Brazil man,
where there's three UFC champions.

2400
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:02,540
I mean,
Zoe,

2401
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:04,210
how many weight classes now?
There's 35.

2402
01:41:04,211 --> 01:41:05,440
40th five.
Fifty five.

2403
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,030
Seventy,
85.

2404
01:41:07,390 --> 01:41:07,870
Two.
Oh,

2405
01:41:07,871 --> 01:41:12,871
five and heavyweight.
So there's seven weight classes and 

2406
01:41:12,871 --> 01:41:13,570
three of them are dominated by 
Brazilians.

2407
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,670
Wow,
that's amazing.

2408
01:41:14,671 --> 01:41:17,050
I don't have that in Americans.
What's that?

2409
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:20,590
Don't have as many Americans know.
George St Pierre who is one 70.

2410
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:25,620
But then meg diaz and Carlos condit to 
Americans are going to be fighting for 

2411
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:28,580
the interim belt.
So that's kind of why.

2412
01:41:28,830 --> 01:41:29,970
Oh,
and Tom Pill.

2413
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:35,160
Well,
it's means a lot because George is out 

2414
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:35,160
for a long time.
He's nice blown.

2415
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:36,160
He had to get surgery.
He had to get a job.

2416
01:41:36,161 --> 01:41:39,040
You never can tell a tendon graph.
It's a big surgery.

2417
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:41,560
The patella tendon graft is a really 
difficult one.

2418
01:41:41,561 --> 01:41:44,290
The way they do that,
it's a long road to recovery.

2419
01:41:44,291 --> 01:41:46,620
You have to.
They take a chunk of bone out of your,

2420
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:51,780
your kneecap and a chunk of bone out of 
your Shin and they sliced the Patella 

2421
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:54,130
tendon,
they take a piece of it off and they use

2422
01:41:54,131 --> 01:41:59,131
that piece to recreate the acl,
the anterior cruciate ligament that's 

2423
01:41:59,131 --> 01:42:00,220
inside the middle of the need of 
stabilizing ligaments.

2424
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:02,170
So then they have to screw that in 
place.

2425
01:42:02,171 --> 01:42:07,171
They have to drill holes and then they 
have to take a little piece of bone we 

2426
01:42:07,171 --> 01:42:09,280
took from your kneecap and stuff and 
into your bone stuff into your,

2427
01:42:09,281 --> 01:42:10,540
you know,
your humorous.

2428
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:13,060
Is that what it is?
What's the Femur?

2429
01:42:13,061 --> 01:42:18,061
Femur.
Seven in your femur and then they 

2430
01:42:18,061 --> 01:42:18,061
stuffed it into the lower one to 
whatever your shin bone is.

2431
01:42:18,061 --> 01:42:20,470
Yeah.
It's gnarly shit for a long time.

2432
01:42:20,471 --> 01:42:21,390
Forever.
What have you had?

2433
01:42:22,190 --> 01:42:27,190
Well,
that is actually a technique that 

2434
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:28,150
they've been using for a long time.
The patella tendon graft that more than,

2435
01:42:28,151 --> 01:42:33,151
more than 20 years because I hadn't done
a Patella tendon graft done in the 

2436
01:42:33,151 --> 01:42:33,151
nineties.
I had done,

2437
01:42:33,151 --> 01:42:35,620
I believe it was 93.
I had it done.

2438
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:39,640
Um,
but now they are more and more likely or

2439
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:40,400
use,
um,

2440
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:42,700
a graph from a dead person.

2441
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:45,670
I have in my right knee.
A cadaver graft.

2442
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,720
Yeah.
They use the Achilles tendon.

2443
01:42:49,450 --> 01:42:51,810
Is He really doing new plastic news?
Artificial knees?

2444
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,970
He has no cartilage in his knees either 
one,

2445
01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:59,370
zero.
Our friend Sean rouse has a crazy form 

2446
01:42:59,370 --> 01:43:00,720
of arthritis.
It's like super aggressive arthritis and

2447
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:05,780
still happen now.
I'm sure they might have gotten bumped 

2448
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:05,780
up.
Yeah.

2449
01:43:06,150 --> 01:43:08,860
Obviously,
like I know a guy who works at whatever.

2450
01:43:09,070 --> 01:43:10,600
So what are they?
Gonna you know how they do them and they

2451
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:12,590
have to cut your knee off.
Yeah,

2452
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:17,640
he's got pretty much nothing.
You ever seen how they do hip 

2453
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:17,640
replacements?
Gnarly,

2454
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:18,400
dude.
They take the socket out,

2455
01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:23,401
they cut it off,
they saw it off and they put a new 

2456
01:43:23,401 --> 01:43:24,400
socket in there and drive it into your 
fucking bone.

2457
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:29,970
Screw this bolt into your bone.
And now you have this new ball and 

2458
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:34,171
socket set up in your head.
That's probably 100 times better than 

2459
01:43:34,171 --> 01:43:34,171
the original.
Yeah.

2460
01:43:34,171 --> 01:43:35,380
Well,
I want to get everything replaced.

2461
01:43:35,381 --> 01:43:38,750
Sort of know because it's like it's also
an alien piece.

2462
01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:44,770
It will.
It will start to resolve after about 15 

2463
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:44,770
years,
which is totally fine for him,

2464
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:46,660
but he goes off to where just into my 
body.

2465
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:51,620
Well after 15 years and so then they go 
back and replace it 15 years ago.

2466
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:52,040
They probably have

2467
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:54,710
amazing ones.
Maybe probably they'll probably have one

2468
01:43:54,711 --> 01:43:59,711
that's better than the human knee when 
you would think with the lightweight 

2469
01:43:59,711 --> 01:44:04,421
materials and if they could figure out 
something that's way better 

2470
01:44:04,421 --> 01:44:05,840
biocompatible surgeries just because 
like I don't need it,

2471
01:44:05,841 --> 01:44:10,841
but fuck it.
Well if you've seen that dude who he's 

2472
01:44:10,841 --> 01:44:13,301
got no legs,
he lost his legs and he's competing in 

2473
01:44:13,301 --> 01:44:16,661
races with these artificial legs.
He lost his legs below the knee and so 

2474
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:19,220
they put the spring things.
Yeah,

2475
01:44:19,221 --> 01:44:23,540
these crazy fucking things and he.
It actually,

2476
01:44:23,541 --> 01:44:25,280
it's like kicking ass with these things,
man.

2477
01:44:25,281 --> 01:44:30,281
He could run fast and some people are 
actually saying like this is an unfair 

2478
01:44:30,281 --> 01:44:31,850
advantage.
Like you can't say that man.

2479
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:36,200
Dude gets his legs cut off springs on 
his leg though,

2480
01:44:36,201 --> 01:44:41,201
but they still running down unless he's 
breaking world records.

2481
01:44:41,570 --> 01:44:43,910
You got to deal with that shit.
As long as it gets closer,

2482
01:44:43,930 --> 01:44:44,390
it's okay.

2483
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:46,820
Yeah.
Unless he's breaking world records.

2484
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:52,090
That would be incredible.
The humanity of guys started getting 

2485
01:44:52,090 --> 01:44:54,701
their legs cut off so that they could 
run as fast as him and getting these 

2486
01:44:54,701 --> 01:44:56,450
artificial feet screwed on somebody to 
make these skates and whether they would

2487
01:44:56,451 --> 01:45:01,451
do is speed skates.
They would come slightly apart from the 

2488
01:45:01,451 --> 01:45:03,950
skate as you were stepping up,
so they'll give you an extra split.

2489
01:45:03,951 --> 01:45:06,110
Second of ice time if it's touching the 
ice.

2490
01:45:06,111 --> 01:45:08,330
The blade,
the like slowly removed from your shoe.

2491
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:11,060
Staying a little longer and all those.
I think it was.

2492
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:12,950
I think it was Swiss.
I don't know.

2493
01:45:12,951 --> 01:45:16,370
They're all fucking shattering records.
Jesus Christ just from doing that.

2494
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,960
Yeah.
Is that amazing?

2495
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:20,370
Clever little monkeys.
You know.

2496
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:25,720
Clever little monkeys figure that out.
I remember this last past a Olympics 

2497
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:27,210
with a dude died on the.
Bob Forgot.

2498
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:34,180
Gnarly man.
That's why I'm a huge proponent of 

2499
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:34,180
everyone should have to wear a helmet.

2500
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:34,850
Karen's.
Yeah.

2501
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:39,430
Everyone to know that that's possible.
Yeah.

2502
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:41,780
We need to know that that's possible.
You know,

2503
01:45:42,430 --> 01:45:47,430
that's,
that's not something you should keep 

2504
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:48,941
from people.
People that are considering being a 

2505
01:45:48,941 --> 01:45:51,311
bobsled person could die from this.
Everyone was saying how it was way too 

2506
01:45:51,311 --> 01:45:52,130
fast,
was running way too fast.

2507
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:55,730
Well,
you look at what they're doing,

2508
01:45:55,731 --> 01:46:00,731
man,
so fast flying in those fucking things 

2509
01:46:00,731 --> 01:46:01,970
and I guess somehow or another you're 
steering with your weight,

2510
01:46:01,971 --> 01:46:03,610
correct?
Yeah,

2511
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:04,250
I think so.
I mean,

2512
01:46:04,251 --> 01:46:06,050
you must be doing something if they 
needed to turn.

2513
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:07,790
Right,
right.

2514
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:10,460
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

2515
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,560
Damn,
there was a dude who was a fighter.

2516
01:46:12,561 --> 01:46:15,630
He fought a todd hayes.
He fought in valley to,

2517
01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:18,860
in Japan and uh,
he was supposed to fight Hixon Gracie,

2518
01:46:18,861 --> 01:46:21,110
but he blew his shoulder out in the 
fight before that he won.

2519
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:23,390
And um,
he uh,

2520
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:25,790
quit fighting and to become a bobsled 
guy.

2521
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:26,560
Really?
Yeah.

2522
01:46:26,570 --> 01:46:28,160
That was just Walkerton bobsledding for 
awhile.

2523
01:46:28,190 --> 01:46:30,740
Did he totally mixed one gold when they 
started,

2524
01:46:30,741 --> 01:46:32,330
they started rethinking it.
They were like,

2525
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:33,480
oh,
we don't need bobsledders.

2526
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:36,650
We need to fucking track people.
We need people that are fucking fast and

2527
01:46:36,651 --> 01:46:38,780
strong to push the Basic Osha Walker 
made them win.

2528
01:46:38,781 --> 01:46:40,690
The goal you,
I think he wants something,

2529
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:42,020
probably not the goal.
That sounds ridiculous.

2530
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:43,990
Walker,
that's a bad motherfucker,

2531
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:45,480
dude.
He made the cowboys.

2532
01:46:45,490 --> 01:46:49,350
He's like 47 or 48 years old now and 
he's still fighting mma.

2533
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,110
A fondant,
fondant.

2534
01:46:51,140 --> 01:46:53,430
Strikeforce twice.
At least twice in one.

2535
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:56,070
Dude.
He's fucking show readed.

2536
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:58,430
He's ridiculously shredded.
Really?

2537
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:03,560
Oh my God.
He's 48 years old and he apparently has 

2538
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:06,700
like super human discipline.
Never lifted a weight that you put.

2539
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:11,990
Well he says that,
but then other dudes say that he has 

2540
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:11,990
lifted weights,
has.

2541
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:11,990
Well,
no.

2542
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:13,170
He also has a multiple personality 
disorder,

2543
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:18,860
so he could be saying that he's not 
lifting weights and he's telling the 

2544
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:22,200
truth because he's not lifting weights.
But Clyde is in Clyde's the one that has

2545
01:47:22,201 --> 01:47:27,201
the past 24 hours,
but I think I'm pretty sure I don't want

2546
01:47:28,951 --> 01:47:33,951
to talk out of school,
but I'm pretty sure I read on his 

2547
01:47:33,951 --> 01:47:35,931
website that he has trauma related 
multiple personality disorder from 

2548
01:47:36,151 --> 01:47:36,990
football.
Yeah.

2549
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:39,660
And I read that and I was like,
wow.

2550
01:47:39,661 --> 01:47:41,970
Well why is this guy fighting in mma 
then?

2551
01:47:41,970 --> 01:47:46,970
You know,
that seems crazy that he would go from 

2552
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:47,640
that to fighting and mma,
but the fights that he's had to,

2553
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:51,570
he's just mauled people.
He's such a fucking super athlete.

2554
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:56,870
If Hershel Walker was around for mma,
was around when Herschel Walker was 

2555
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:56,870
young when he was.
Yeah.

2556
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:58,140
If he,
if he had decided to do that.

2557
01:47:58,230 --> 01:48:00,360
He's,
there's every now and then there's dudes

2558
01:48:00,361 --> 01:48:03,120
that can just throw people around.
They just,

2559
01:48:03,290 --> 01:48:04,920
they're just so dominant for a little 
while.

2560
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:06,690
The Vikings pretty much true to their 
whole team.

2561
01:48:06,691 --> 01:48:11,691
For him it was like everybody that had 
good at draft picks for the next five 

2562
01:48:11,691 --> 01:48:12,580
years while we want to map back to.
Well,

2563
01:48:12,670 --> 01:48:14,030
that's a super athlete,
man.

2564
01:48:14,031 --> 01:48:16,130
It made the cowboys for so long.
Yeah.

2565
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:18,300
Did you hear me?
Whether he wants to fight,

2566
01:48:18,301 --> 01:48:19,140
pick,
pack man now?

2567
01:48:19,190 --> 01:48:20,520
Yeah,
because he's going to jail.

2568
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:21,150
Oh,
is that why?

2569
01:48:21,150 --> 01:48:21,870
Yeah,
the judge,

2570
01:48:21,871 --> 01:48:25,650
the judge will let him a postpone his 
jail time until June.

2571
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,110
So if he can get pack you out of fight 
him in May,

2572
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:31,020
he'll make a shitload of money and then 
go to jail for 90 days.

2573
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:33,510
So since the judge has allowed him to 
postpone and he's like,

2574
01:48:33,511 --> 01:48:34,080
all right,
fuck it,

2575
01:48:34,081 --> 01:48:37,080
let's go after a fight.
Let's go fight problem.

2576
01:48:37,081 --> 01:48:38,720
No,
it will not be a lame fight.

2577
01:48:40,090 --> 01:48:42,420
Pacquiao was a killer.
But I think that um,

2578
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:46,670
a lot of people feel that patio was 
exposed a little bit by Marquez.

2579
01:48:46,690 --> 01:48:51,690
Now while I'm in,
I'm all Marquez fight that they've had 

2580
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:51,690
three fights now and that,
uh,

2581
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:55,880
you know,
mark has felt like he won two of those 

2582
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:55,880
and uh,
you know,

2583
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:59,990
it wasn't,
not nearly the dominant victory that 

2584
01:48:59,990 --> 01:49:02,451
pack out hope for.
So a lot of people I think are thinking 

2585
01:49:02,451 --> 01:49:02,451
that of floyd mayweather.

2586
01:49:02,451 --> 01:49:04,800
It was scared of him before.
Now he's like relaxed now he saw the way

2587
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:06,600
Martin shot.
Yeah,

2588
01:49:06,601 --> 01:49:09,270
because he,
he box the shit out of Marquez when they

2589
01:49:09,271 --> 01:49:11,370
fought.
Floyd didn't even take any damage.

2590
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:16,520
Floyd Mayweather.
It's just technically and strategically 

2591
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:20,181
on another level.
The thing about pack les packy out is 

2592
01:49:20,181 --> 01:49:20,181
he's a,
he's a beast.

2593
01:49:20,181 --> 01:49:23,520
He's got crazy power in his hands,
ridiculous speed,

2594
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,380
and he can catch anybody.
And if he,

2595
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:30,560
if he tees off on floyd and he gets a 
good rhythm and starts coming at him 

2596
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:31,110
with those wild combinations,
anything can happen.

2597
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:32,820
But Floyd doesn't feel like he could do 
that.

2598
01:49:32,821 --> 01:49:33,900
Floyd.
Things that could stop them.

2599
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:37,650
Now he's doing one on.
I don't know if I had a gamble.

2600
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:41,970
It's hard to bet against Pacquiao 
because pack has been fighting.

2601
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:45,270
He's been fighting big guys too.
When he fought,

2602
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:48,700
you know when,
when he fought flux is named Margarito.

2603
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:51,670
He'd beat the shit out of Margarita.
Margarita was way bigger than him.

2604
01:49:51,671 --> 01:49:54,760
And Margaret is a dangerous guy.
He fucked Margarito up,

2605
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:57,040
you know?
I mean he broke his eye socket.

2606
01:49:57,041 --> 01:49:58,660
He broke his orbital,
made him.

2607
01:49:58,930 --> 01:50:01,270
He has an artificial lens in his eye 
now.

2608
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:03,850
Margarito does because of that fight.
Yeah.

2609
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:06,310
I was 15,
16 pounds lighter than him.

2610
01:50:06,311 --> 01:50:07,660
Easily.
Maybe even more.

2611
01:50:07,661 --> 01:50:11,560
It might've been 18 pounds during fight 
time because they weigh him on Hbo.

2612
01:50:11,561 --> 01:50:14,770
They way on the day of the fight too.
And they see how much it guys rehydrated

2613
01:50:14,771 --> 01:50:16,930
and they show you that statistic,
which I think is brilliant.

2614
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:19,210
The UFC should probably incorporate 
something like that too,

2615
01:50:19,211 --> 01:50:21,850
but I don't think they wanted to meant 
how much.

2616
01:50:21,851 --> 01:50:26,851
Yeah,
some guys are cutting like guys like 

2617
01:50:26,851 --> 01:50:26,851
Anthony Johnson,
the other Chatam,

2618
01:50:26,851 --> 01:50:30,720
Anthony Johnson's fight and Vito Belfort
this weekend in Brazil that's going to 

2619
01:50:31,571 --> 01:50:36,571
be fucking car and he's fighting at one 
85 for the first time to which for 

2620
01:50:36,571 --> 01:50:40,171
Anthony's,
the right move if you've never seen 

2621
01:50:40,171 --> 01:50:42,181
Anthony Johnson before,
he's another specimen or specimen 

2622
01:50:42,181 --> 01:50:44,420
through a specimen and he's a big one 
70,

2623
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:49,430
like the biggest possible and he would,
I would see him walking around like in 

2624
01:50:49,430 --> 01:50:49,720
between fights and it was well over 200 
pounds.

2625
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:51,850
It was enormous.
He looked like a heavyweight,

2626
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:53,080
you know,
and then he would drop.

2627
01:50:53,110 --> 01:50:55,960
He said at one point in time he cut 60 
pounds to make,

2628
01:50:56,220 --> 01:51:01,220
to make one 70 a long time.
I mean I'm sure he did it over a long 

2629
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:02,290
camp but starved themselves.
60.

2630
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:05,590
It was up to like 2:30.
I know exactly.

2631
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:07,460
Meanwhile with him was mostly muscle.
You know it.

2632
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:11,050
Most of them Meghan's body eat itself.
You dehydrating and eat itself.

2633
01:51:11,170 --> 01:51:12,370
I mean,
he's losing a little bit of fat,

2634
01:51:12,371 --> 01:51:14,170
but he's not a fat guy.
It doesn't get fat.

2635
01:51:14,171 --> 01:51:16,420
It's just an athlete.
Let's fucking brutal man.

2636
01:51:16,421 --> 01:51:21,421
It's like the a point of diminishing 
returns and I can't do that because of a

2637
01:51:22,780 --> 01:51:24,200
brain damage.
That's when it's.

2638
01:51:24,230 --> 01:51:26,200
Most people are most susceptible to 
brain damage.

2639
01:51:26,230 --> 01:51:28,780
Then you won't cut it like they would.
They would.

2640
01:51:28,810 --> 01:51:29,920
They would cut anyway.
Yeah,

2641
01:51:29,921 --> 01:51:30,670
they cut anyway.

2642
01:51:30,730 --> 01:51:32,800
They always do.
They used to have a wait.

2643
01:51:32,830 --> 01:51:34,960
They used to have it in boxing.
They used to have the day of,

2644
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:39,010
but more people die of brain injuries 
because of dehydration.

2645
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:42,580
What happened after the fight?
I don't think in the old days the box.

2646
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:48,130
Yeah.
It doesn't matter if she lives all 

2647
01:51:48,130 --> 01:51:49,910
weight during fight alone.
Take a lot of people were hip to a ivs 

2648
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:52,000
back in the day either.
So when they would lose weight,

2649
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:53,530
when they would lose weight,
no.

2650
01:51:53,531 --> 01:51:57,040
No eyeballs to replenish.
To put your liquids back in.

2651
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:59,100
That's the best way to look.
So weak.

2652
01:51:59,101 --> 01:52:02,050
When are the winds are death?
I've seen guys looked.

2653
01:52:02,110 --> 01:52:03,230
Terrified.
Think.

2654
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:04,300
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2655
01:52:04,330 --> 01:52:06,100
Breath is horrible.
Yeah.

2656
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:06,790
Yeah.
Well,

2657
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:09,920
I mean they don't eat for,
you know,

2658
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,890
they don't eat for a long time before 
they get up there.

2659
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:14,400
A lot of the guys except the 
heavyweights heavyweights,

2660
01:52:14,410 --> 01:52:14,710
they're.

2661
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:17,560
I love their jeans.
Fuck it.

2662
01:52:17,670 --> 01:52:22,670
About the same,
but there's a few guys that have had to 

2663
01:52:22,670 --> 01:52:24,631
cut weight at heavyweight.
Tim Sylvia had a cut weight once he 

2664
01:52:24,631 --> 01:52:25,540
waiting over.
I remember that he was over to 65.

2665
01:52:25,570 --> 01:52:28,930
Brock's always made the weight cuts.
He cuts to that.

2666
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:29,780
Yeah.
If he,

2667
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:34,920
if he wanted to,
he gets about 300 pounds if you want to 

2668
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:34,920
do.
I'm sure we started packing on the Korea

2669
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:37,090
team doing power lifting and shit like 
that and eating all day,

2670
01:52:37,450 --> 01:52:39,370
but I don't think he can eat all day now
because of that.

2671
01:52:39,371 --> 01:52:42,610
A stomach thing I think is diet.
It's got to be very different.

2672
01:52:43,610 --> 01:52:45,230
That's not just time,
dude.

2673
01:52:45,231 --> 01:52:47,840
He had diverticulitis.
You could die from that shit,

2674
01:52:47,841 --> 01:52:48,980
man.
People die.

2675
01:52:49,370 --> 01:52:51,230
It's amazing.
I never even heard of that before he got

2676
01:52:51,231 --> 01:52:52,070
it.
I never heard of that.

2677
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:53,370
It should rename it.
Okay.

2678
01:52:53,450 --> 01:52:55,190
Brock Lesnar's disease,
same way.

2679
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:58,220
Lou Gehrig had all the time that you and
I have been to Fogo de Chao,

2680
01:52:58,250 --> 01:53:02,390
all of those Brazilian steakhouses who 
would've ever thought that someone could

2681
01:53:02,391 --> 01:53:07,391
die from eating too much meat.
That's when you have ever thought of 

2682
01:53:07,391 --> 01:53:10,241
that.
We've been going to those places for a 

2683
01:53:10,241 --> 01:53:10,241
decade.
Got To get to the wind in Brazil.

2684
01:53:10,241 --> 01:53:13,600
Fuck Ya know the ones in Brazil or even 
better because they serve like chicken 

2685
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:15,830
hearts and stuff that people in America 
are kind of scared of.

2686
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:17,300
That shit's delicious,
dude.

2687
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:22,320
With when we went to one in Sao Paulo,
it was one of the best ones I've ever 

2688
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:25,361
been to ever,
and they just kept giving us these 

2689
01:53:25,361 --> 01:53:25,361
chicken hearts.
I was like,

2690
01:53:25,361 --> 01:53:25,361
dude,
keep coming with them.

2691
01:53:25,361 --> 01:53:25,610
Chicken hearts.
Ooh.

2692
01:53:26,050 --> 01:53:28,620
It's like salted.
They know how to cook.

2693
01:53:28,770 --> 01:53:31,250
Do is grill in Israel.
This just a wild culture,

2694
01:53:31,251 --> 01:53:32,600
man.
It's a beautiful culture.

2695
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:34,760
The culture of Brazil is so fun,
you know,

2696
01:53:34,761 --> 01:53:39,761
meat and fighting and the girls are 
beautiful and they're living on the 

2697
01:53:39,761 --> 01:53:42,910
beach ass and everybody's doing a play 
in Jujitsu.

2698
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:43,820
I mean it's like,
wow,

2699
01:53:43,821 --> 01:53:45,680
what a,
what a crazy culture man.

2700
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:47,600
And soccer and everything,
you know,

2701
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:52,810
and their,
their economy has changed in a big way 

2702
01:53:52,810 --> 01:53:56,171
over the last few years.
Apparently they found oil off the shore 

2703
01:53:56,171 --> 01:53:57,470
and their economy's booming.
Leaders,

2704
01:53:57,810 --> 01:54:00,610
the leaders of the world in aids 
research and,

2705
01:54:00,670 --> 01:54:01,890
and uh,
and um,

2706
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:02,990
education.
Really.

2707
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:08,020
Yeah.
So a lot of places in Rio also I've 

2708
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:10,691
heard where people go to get a good but 
cheap plastic surgery can see that.

2709
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:15,940
Yeah,
like a girls in Hollywood that can't 

2710
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:16,550
afford going to doctors here.
You can fly to Brazil and get their shit

2711
01:54:16,551 --> 01:54:19,790
done their time and stuff I guess.
And then you know,

2712
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:23,450
then you just chill out and Rio,
chill on the beach while your tits.

2713
01:54:23,451 --> 01:54:28,451
He'll get on a plane and head home like 
I want to vacation.

2714
01:54:28,551 --> 01:54:29,480
Came back with tits.

2715
01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:36,500
I'm excited to hold another culture.
Just don't go to the favelas looking for

2716
01:54:36,501 --> 01:54:41,501
heroin,
keep it together and don't get bit by a 

2717
01:54:41,501 --> 01:54:44,801
Brazilian watering spider.
Does a Brazilian wandering spider that 

2718
01:54:44,801 --> 01:54:48,161
kills you.
And one of the things that happens is 

2719
01:54:48,161 --> 01:54:48,161
the people that survive,
first of all,

2720
01:54:48,161 --> 01:54:51,560
you will.
You will have a 24 hour raging death.

2721
01:54:51,590 --> 01:54:52,810
Hard on.
Really?

2722
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:53,690
Yes.
Yeah.

2723
01:54:53,870 --> 01:54:58,870
The way it affects your body.
It apparently blasts your levels of 

2724
01:54:58,870 --> 01:55:00,050
nitric acid and nitric oxide,
which is,

2725
01:55:00,051 --> 01:55:00,740
uh,
the same thing.

2726
01:55:00,741 --> 01:55:04,760
That was the same effect that Viagra has
like and with this stuff does,

2727
01:55:04,761 --> 01:55:09,761
is just make your dick hard as fucking 
cold steel to the point where it's 

2728
01:55:09,951 --> 01:55:12,170
painful.
When your Dick is dying,

2729
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:17,350
it's expanded so hard that it's tearing.
Literally the cells are ripping apart 

2730
01:55:17,350 --> 01:55:20,960
from each other.
It's getting so big and so hard that the

2731
01:55:20,961 --> 01:55:25,190
cells are separating from each other,
tearing in agony,

2732
01:55:25,191 --> 01:55:30,191
in screaming pain,
and this is happening to all your 

2733
01:55:30,191 --> 01:55:30,191
muscles.
Not just your cock,

2734
01:55:30,191 --> 01:55:32,120
but every muscle in your body.
It's just in mad agony.

2735
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:34,340
And if you survive and most people 
don't,

2736
01:55:34,490 --> 01:55:36,500
but if you survive,
you'll be fucked.

2737
01:55:36,530 --> 01:55:38,120
You'll be dead.
You might as well be dead.

2738
01:55:38,170 --> 01:55:39,470
You.
Dick won't work anymore.

2739
01:55:39,471 --> 01:55:41,810
It's done forever.
Your body is going to be a rack.

2740
01:55:41,811 --> 01:55:43,980
You're going to be physically a wreck.
All your muscles are going to be.

2741
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:44,630
So wait,
did they?

2742
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:46,610
Did they.
Once you get bit what happens to,

2743
01:55:46,630 --> 01:55:51,630
can you go to the doctor immediately or 
almost immediately?

2744
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,370
Almost immediately.
You're fucked.

2745
01:55:53,740 --> 01:55:54,420
There's no.
I don't.

2746
01:55:54,430 --> 01:55:57,420
I don't know if they have a.
What would you say percentage wise?

2747
01:55:57,421 --> 01:55:59,820
Are you worried about the spider?
Me.

2748
01:55:59,821 --> 01:56:01,080
I'm not going to the jungle.
Oh,

2749
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:04,200
said word.
I hope it's only in the jungle shit.

2750
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:06,030
I'm pretty sure it's only in the jungle.
Yeah,

2751
01:56:06,330 --> 01:56:09,980
but if I want to put myself in a fucking
boy in the plastic bubble suit,

2752
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:13,800
dress up like man,
I don't know.

2753
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:15,630
I,
I'm not really worried about it.

2754
01:56:15,690 --> 01:56:18,890
I hotels it is down there.
Beautiful hotels.

2755
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:21,090
Pretty much everyone where they ever 
have tourists from other places.

2756
01:56:21,091 --> 01:56:22,530
Like the Nice hotels are nice 
everywhere.

2757
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:24,180
Yeah.
And any city in the world.

2758
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:29,520
It's a real city.
They're going to have some nice places 

2759
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:29,520
to stay even in,
you know,

2760
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,050
I mean I've seen like Kuwait,
Kuwait has beautiful,

2761
01:56:31,051 --> 01:56:33,900
beautiful hotels and you know,
it's Kinda crazy.

2762
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:38,900
You would think someone would just went 
to war with Iraq just a few years ago 

2763
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:39,720
and probably be a mess right now.
Right now that really grow there.

2764
01:56:39,721 --> 01:56:41,430
It's beautiful.
I had a crazy dream.

2765
01:56:41,431 --> 01:56:42,420
I just,
I quit pot and I,

2766
01:56:42,430 --> 01:56:44,040
my dreams went nuts.
He tells me.

2767
01:56:44,130 --> 01:56:46,020
Tell us about that because how long did 
you quit it for?

2768
01:56:46,050 --> 01:56:47,580
Thirteen days.
Wow.

2769
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:50,250
But I'm an everyday,
multiple times a day smoker.

2770
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:56,460
Um,
I heard that you get dreams or 

2771
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:56,460
nightmares after three days.
Nightmares.

2772
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:58,710
Yeah.
So I was trying to put three days to try

2773
01:56:58,711 --> 01:57:03,711
to get the dream,
the nightmare to see what would happen 

2774
01:57:03,711 --> 01:57:03,711
if you quit.
But it took me,

2775
01:57:03,711 --> 01:57:03,960
it took me two years.
We need to give you some Alpha brain.

2776
01:57:04,290 --> 01:57:06,470
I've been out for brand would give you 
some ridiculous.

2777
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,220
A lot of people kept saying like,
oh,

2778
01:57:08,250 --> 01:57:11,250
it must be the Alpha brain or whatever 
it was you really vivid dreams.

2779
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:13,340
We don't.
It's a combination of all the,

2780
01:57:13,370 --> 01:57:15,920
the neutral bigs and the B six.
And because B,

2781
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:20,940
six on its own apparently can do that.
A lot of the neutral box on their own 

2782
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:22,800
can give you some weird dream effects.
But apparently all of them together with

2783
01:57:22,801 --> 01:57:25,500
the [inaudible] really kicks it was 
every night.

2784
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:30,960
Definitely did mushrooms.
Every night I would get the crate like 

2785
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:31,270
plot-driven dreams,
like long and clear,

2786
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,340
like a member of the for way longer.
Well,

2787
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:38,420
I'm,
one of them was I was dropping the 

2788
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:38,420
jungle in Brazil and there was all these
dangerous predators,

2789
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:39,720
but there's also tons of mushroom 
spores.

2790
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,020
So we were like,
dude,

2791
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:44,250
I think it's good to stop smoking pot 
for a little bit.

2792
01:57:44,251 --> 01:57:46,240
I think it's good to stop doing 
everything brick.

2793
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:51,440
I take meat breaks,
I take breaks where I'll eat like 

2794
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:51,780
vegetables for like a couple of hours a 
little bit.

2795
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:52,680
Just for the fuck of it.

2796
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:56,180
I just do it if I feel like doing it.
Like sometimes like there's a,

2797
01:57:56,250 --> 01:58:01,250
a good Vegan restaurant in your hair and
every now and then I'll just have this 

2798
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:02,460
like real hankering for some like real 
vegetable heavy food.

2799
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:05,130
Sounds good.
What are you saying when you mean why?

2800
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:05,940
Ken?
Why?

2801
01:58:05,941 --> 01:58:08,320
What does that Fagan food can?
Well,

2802
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:09,150
Ken.
Wow.

2803
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:12,330
Oh keenwah in that,
um,

2804
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:17,510
that grain that you know,
heavy protein grain of the whole foods 

2805
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:22,100
salad bar.
I got a bunch of different types of 

2806
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:22,100
cameras.
Yeah.

2807
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:25,210
So this is the only plant.
Apparently that has all the amino acids 

2808
01:58:25,210 --> 01:58:25,670
that.
Yeah,

2809
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:28,410
that I think soil.
So I don't think so.

2810
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:30,500
I don't think Soi has everything really.
Yeah.

2811
01:58:30,501 --> 01:58:32,550
And so it makes you grow up.
Tits fucks away.

2812
01:58:32,790 --> 01:58:37,230
So I made Brian cry like Almond Almond 
milk is great for you.

2813
01:58:37,290 --> 01:58:38,850
I love that.
I drink that shit every day.

2814
01:58:39,070 --> 01:58:41,150
I'd say that's pretty much substituted 
my Mo.

2815
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:43,720
Most of my dairy,
unless I'm having cookies,

2816
01:58:43,870 --> 01:58:47,080
it's just the habit.
It's really easy to Make by yourself.

2817
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:48,130
Awesome.
Yeah.

2818
01:58:48,131 --> 01:58:50,580
Almond milk you can make because he had 
the vitamix.

2819
01:58:50,581 --> 01:58:53,680
It's really cool for that reason just to
mix it with water,

2820
01:58:53,681 --> 01:58:55,870
but there's a lot of good recipes online
to make.

2821
01:58:55,871 --> 01:58:58,510
Like do you make it?
I tried it once and it worked.

2822
01:58:58,511 --> 01:59:03,511
So.
So do you have to soak the almonds 

2823
01:59:03,511 --> 01:59:03,511
first?
Is that okay?

2824
01:59:03,511 --> 01:59:05,810
Yeah.
Soak it overnight for 24 hours and then 

2825
01:59:05,810 --> 01:59:05,810
mix it up and there was something else I
did to it.

2826
01:59:06,670 --> 01:59:07,710
Want to do that,
you know,

2827
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:10,660
so I can just go to the store.
I just have it done for you.

2828
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:15,900
Well,
I'm just saying if you're really crazy 

2829
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:15,910
on butter,
like going old school,

2830
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:21,180
make your own butter.
Have you ever tried to make your own 

2831
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:21,180
butter?

2832
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:21,180
Oh,
I made my name.

2833
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:21,760
I my mom pickles.
You dId?

2834
01:59:21,810 --> 01:59:22,700
Yeah.
So why?

2835
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:24,850
Why is a.
Is to make your own butter.

2836
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:27,100
You can't get that kind of recipe.
Oh,

2837
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:32,160
the pickle recipe.
There was a place when we were filming 

2838
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:35,390
in boston.
I wish I remembered their name because 

2839
01:59:35,390 --> 01:59:37,630
that would give him a shout out.
There was a fucking cart that they had 

2840
01:59:37,630 --> 01:59:41,310
where it was all pickles and different 
flavor pickles and some of them were 

2841
01:59:41,310 --> 01:59:44,791
really spicy and some of them are really
crisp and green and some of them were 

2842
01:59:44,791 --> 01:59:48,771
like the more sour,
like darker or lighter colored green 

2843
01:59:48,771 --> 01:59:53,041
ones and they just had every kind of 
pick on their fucking deadly and also 

2844
01:59:53,041 --> 01:59:54,230
jesus christ.
You guys ship these pickles like I gotta

2845
01:59:54,231 --> 01:59:55,990
get these fucking pickles.
There were amazing.

2846
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:57,590
I'll bring you something wrong.
Father mood.

2847
01:59:57,840 --> 02:00:02,840
Oh yeah.
One of the report the best is a bloody 

2848
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:03,280
mary,
but pickled asparagus and green beans in

2849
02:00:03,281 --> 02:00:03,400
it.

2850
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:05,890
Pickled asparagus.
What do they pick lit with?

2851
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:07,450
Same.
Same thing.

2852
02:00:07,451 --> 02:00:08,170
Same thing,
brian.

2853
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:10,090
Once you have.
Once you've already made the brine,

2854
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:11,180
you can use us.
Oh,

2855
02:00:11,190 --> 02:00:12,670
so you just stick something else in 
there,

2856
02:00:12,690 --> 02:00:14,910
huh?
Carrots and like green cucumber.

2857
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:17,620
Pickled cucumbers are good.
Do you ever have that green,

2858
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:20,410
green cucumbers,
those pickled green cucumbers,

2859
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:22,030
cucumbers,
tomatoes.

2860
02:00:22,930 --> 02:00:24,320
Those are delIcious.
It really well.

2861
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:25,180
Yeah,
right there.

2862
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:30,270
Chris.
You're sharp so you can like cut him 

2863
02:00:30,270 --> 02:00:30,270
with a knife.
Yeah,

2864
02:00:30,270 --> 02:00:31,480
jews figured out a lot of cool shit.
She just figured out.

2865
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:36,500
Pastrami.
you got to take off your fucking hat to 

2866
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:36,500
pastrami.
Melodrama.

2867
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:36,500
We did that.
Well,

2868
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:38,560
astronomy is like one of the best for 
sandwiches.

2869
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:41,290
Can you get them more delicious?
Meat for sandwiches.

2870
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:46,440
It's fatty and they slice it real thin 
and ruben's when they put the fucking 

2871
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:48,790
sauerkraut on that bitch and then the.

2872
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:51,250
The dressing.
you guys want to go to jerry's deli.

2873
02:00:51,330 --> 02:00:53,090
The eat right now.
That was the hardest.

2874
02:00:53,470 --> 02:00:55,930
That was the hardest thing when I took 
my po population.

2875
02:00:56,150 --> 02:00:58,000
There was one time I got green in my 
home.

2876
02:00:58,001 --> 02:00:59,860
I got an astronomy,
have pastrami,

2877
02:00:59,861 --> 02:01:01,240
half chop liver,
and I was like,

2878
02:01:01,330 --> 02:01:02,820
I should be smoking a joint right now.
YeAh.

2879
02:01:02,930 --> 02:01:05,290
This is how this should go.
That will definitely enhance the food.

2880
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:08,440
People don't realize how much it does 
enhance how not far at all.

2881
02:01:08,710 --> 02:01:11,050
Real close.
Let's do the um,

2882
02:01:11,670 --> 02:01:12,400
what was I gonna say?
Oh,

2883
02:01:12,401 --> 02:01:15,160
qantas is the best.
If You want to really get down and dirty

2884
02:01:15,161 --> 02:01:17,730
with your pastrami,
that's the best pastrami in la.

2885
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:19,870
CAnters is.
That's the oldest school.

2886
02:01:19,871 --> 02:01:22,960
Old school place in la.
How long has that deli been there?

2887
02:01:23,620 --> 02:01:25,840
A long time.
That's as exactly the same.

2888
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:28,330
Yeah.
If you go into that place that's exactly

2889
02:01:28,331 --> 02:01:31,870
the same as it was in like the 19 
seventies old pictures from the.

2890
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:32,730
Yeah,
it's a,

2891
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:34,150
that's the way older than that.
Yeah,

2892
02:01:34,151 --> 02:01:39,151
way older than that,
but I'm saying I don't think they've 

2893
02:01:39,151 --> 02:01:40,920
done any renovations since the seventies
or maybe it might even be the fifties 

2894
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:43,130
pickles when you sit down and play.
Awesome.

2895
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:48,490
And the food is super legit,
especially in astronomy and the white 

2896
02:01:48,490 --> 02:01:48,560
fish to smoked white fish.
God damn,

2897
02:01:48,561 --> 02:01:52,580
I'm getting hungry bitches.
So to wrap things up,

2898
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:55,930
can you say this before we go tell 
people you can say whatever you want and

2899
02:01:55,980 --> 02:02:00,470
minneapolis the 25th of having a 
whiskey,

2900
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:03,770
throw the battleship around and then I 
think me and christ are gonna.

2901
02:02:03,830 --> 02:02:07,100
Do a show with russell and in toronto.
Oh really?

2902
02:02:07,130 --> 02:02:07,620
I think.
Yeah,

2903
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:09,450
they're working on.
But they have like a festival there.

2904
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:13,630
Russell's february,
toronto.

2905
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:15,190
He's,
that's where he's out there.

2906
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:18,380
Dude.
Russell dominates up there.

2907
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:20,710
What a nice guy.
Russell peters,

2908
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:22,420
if you don't know,

2909
02:02:22,430 --> 02:02:25,340
Russell peters.
What a fucking great guy.

2910
02:02:25,341 --> 02:02:27,260
He is.
He's so friendly,

2911
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:32,400

2912
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:32,420
earth guy.
No like airs about them.

2913
02:02:32,421 --> 02:02:34,490
No bullshit.
I always forget that.

2914
02:02:34,491 --> 02:02:37,050
He's like huge superstar.
I forget.

2915
02:02:37,250 --> 02:02:40,060
We were talking with him and for him 
we're talking at the improv is like,

2916
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:45,080
honestly,
I'm going to go on and it's like you 

2917
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:45,080
can't just go,
oh yeah.

2918
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:45,080
Oh yeah.
You can't just go on.

2919
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:47,240
I forgot who you are.
Just a regular dude.

2920
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:49,760
Yeah.
Well what's really crazy is how a,

2921
02:02:49,820 --> 02:02:54,200
he's a huge other countries in the uk.
He sold out the o two arena,

2922
02:02:54,201 --> 02:02:59,090
like two nights in a row and Canada two 
nights in a row.

2923
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:00,260
Jesus,
that's insane.

2924
02:03:00,290 --> 02:03:02,180
The o two arena is what we do.
The ufc,

2925
02:03:02,620 --> 02:03:04,230
it's huge.
I don't know how many it is.

2926
02:03:04,231 --> 02:03:05,900
It's more than 50,000
like that.

2927
02:03:06,110 --> 02:03:08,080
I don't know.
It's more than 15,000

2928
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:10,190
though.
Jesus fucking gigantic,

2929
02:03:10,191 --> 02:03:15,191
man.
I can't even imagine doing the chicago 

2930
02:03:15,191 --> 02:03:15,191
theater.
It's like 3000.

2931
02:03:15,191 --> 02:03:15,330
Really?
Yeah.

2932
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:16,900
That's pretty good.
Over the summer.

2933
02:03:17,170 --> 02:03:18,410
That was pretty nuts.
Yeah.

2934
02:03:18,430 --> 02:03:19,600
3,000
people.

2935
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:22,910
A lot of people laughing when the labs 
come in.

2936
02:03:22,911 --> 02:03:24,470
It's a boom and it's like,
wow.

2937
02:03:24,590 --> 02:03:25,380
It's not.
It's,

2938
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:27,230
it's a weird thing man.
When you go,

2939
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:29,070
when you,
whenever you go over 500,

2940
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:32,150
like the laughs are bigger,
but the connection is different.

2941
02:03:32,151 --> 02:03:35,540
It's like it's hard to like keep that 
real intimate connection with pete.

2942
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:40,580
Hell myself.
This last time I was able to get a 

2943
02:03:40,580 --> 02:03:40,580
little better because I was like slow 
between jokes on.

2944
02:03:40,580 --> 02:03:45,380
One's a lot longer,
but usually it's like it takes me 10 

2945
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:47,891
minutes to like remember that.
Do you feel like it goes smoother when 

2946
02:03:47,891 --> 02:03:48,440
you pause longer?
Like what is it?

2947
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:50,300
It allows them time to take it in.

2948
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:53,630
He needs more time because it's more 
people bigger.

2949
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:56,660
They all like when you're bouncing off 
the wall and the belly room laughs.

2950
02:03:56,661 --> 02:04:01,661
It's like 80 people and those small 
small rooms that place in boston that 

2951
02:04:01,661 --> 02:04:03,620
upstairs my chinese place.
It was like they all hear each other and

2952
02:04:03,621 --> 02:04:05,980
react immediately.
Well also I think that the,

2953
02:04:05,981 --> 02:04:07,040
the,
the rooms,

2954
02:04:07,050 --> 02:04:12,050
acoustics are different.
The way you process sound is different 

2955
02:04:12,050 --> 02:04:13,490
when there's so much loudness around you
with laughter and then this,

2956
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:15,750
this is projected from speakers at a 
fall.

2957
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:20,760
I mean it,
that's a tricky thing and you can't 

2958
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:22,100
really see the guy really well so you 
can't get the facial expressions,

2959
02:04:22,870 --> 02:04:25,520
the little non written cues like it's 
time to laugh.

2960
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:26,960
Yeah.
That's when comedy gets weIrd.

2961
02:04:26,961 --> 02:04:30,110
When you have like giant screens where 
your face is on these giant screens,

2962
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:31,670
man,
you'd have to.

2963
02:04:31,710 --> 02:04:32,090
You can't.

2964
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:34,160
No one can see you if you do something 
that big.

2965
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:36,170
Well dane would do those big places like
that,

2966
02:04:36,171 --> 02:04:38,970
but he would do it in round.
He would do them in the rounds.

2967
02:04:38,971 --> 02:04:40,380
They'd have to have somebody in on the 
screen.

2968
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:45,440
They'd have to.
You have to because otherwise you're 

2969
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:45,440
looking at his ass,
you know,

2970
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:49,780
which some girls would love started.
He hasn't done comedy and like a year I,

2971
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:52,470
it's very word.
I see.

2972
02:04:52,490 --> 02:04:57,490
I'm just going to do an ice house 
current close too soon show.

2973
02:04:58,320 --> 02:04:59,490
Maybe.
Maybe he will.

2974
02:05:00,150 --> 02:05:02,070
Maybe he'll just do the podcast part 
though.

2975
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:07,460
Some people still just fucking tired of 
this show and he's like,

2976
02:05:07,470 --> 02:05:08,400
keep asking me,
but no,

2977
02:05:08,401 --> 02:05:10,590
I'm not back yet.
That's funny.

2978
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:12,510
Yeah,
he's going to take more than a year off.

2979
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:14,760
I wonder what he's doing.
You know what?

2980
02:05:14,761 --> 02:05:16,440
Some people are just not happy with what
they're doing.

2981
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:20,640
This is what I heard that it was like 
slang pussies sold out like 15,000

2982
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:21,480
seaters,
whatever.

2983
02:05:21,481 --> 02:05:23,140
It's like,
that's,

2984
02:05:23,430 --> 02:05:24,660
that's the top of what you're supposed 
to do.

2985
02:05:24,661 --> 02:05:26,040
And I was like,
what am I supposed to go?

2986
02:05:26,070 --> 02:05:28,660
just keep doing that.
There's nowhere else to go or she,

2987
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:29,870
you know,
strongly for.

2988
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:33,180
maybe that could be it or he's just 
like,

2989
02:05:33,181 --> 02:05:35,510
we all strive to get bigger followings,
but it's like,

2990
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:37,290
I got it.
I've got the biggest following and get.

2991
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:42,440
Well,
his following definitely dropped off 

2992
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:42,440
though.
I know I talked to people that worked in

2993
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:45,501
places that where he was at where he had
been there a couple of years before and 

2994
02:05:45,501 --> 02:05:49,251
sold 15,000
seats and then he came back and sold 

2995
02:05:49,251 --> 02:05:49,251
like seven.

2996
02:05:49,251 --> 02:05:49,800
It wasn't him was still huge,
but it wasn't.

2997
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:52,220
It wasn't what it was at the peak of its
popularity.

2998
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:58,180
It's also a lot of negativity.
He dealt with a lot of people that were 

2999
02:05:58,350 --> 02:06:01,860
not just warranted but even unwarranted 
negativity.

3000
02:06:01,861 --> 02:06:03,570
There's a lot of people that hated that 
guy.

3001
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:04,580
Yeah.
You know,

3002
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:09,590
there was,
there was warranted stuff like the 

3003
02:06:09,590 --> 02:06:09,590
plagiarism stuff that was,
you know,

3004
02:06:09,590 --> 02:06:10,240
it was kind of questionable it.
Well,

3005
02:06:10,241 --> 02:06:12,990
I shouldn't say questionable,
but it was a thought.

3006
02:06:13,350 --> 02:06:15,000
Yeah,
he probably stopped.

3007
02:06:15,310 --> 02:06:18,150
He's stopped doing that for sure.
But it was also.

3008
02:06:18,151 --> 02:06:19,560
I mean,
the way it all went down,

3009
02:06:19,561 --> 02:06:22,530
it was very unfortunate for him.
It was,

3010
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:24,180
it looked horrible.
You know,

3011
02:06:24,181 --> 02:06:29,181
when,
when people were playing the louis ck 

3012
02:06:29,181 --> 02:06:29,430
beds next to his bits and just became,
sort of watch them on louis' show.

3013
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:31,220
Yes,
same.

3014
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:32,400
Yeah.
I didn't,

3015
02:06:32,430 --> 02:06:34,200
I thought that was weird,
you know,

3016
02:06:34,201 --> 02:06:38,440
I think I like the way louis like kinda 
like let them win because that's a,

3017
02:06:38,490 --> 02:06:41,250
that's in line with how lily would deal 
with the situation.

3018
02:06:41,250 --> 02:06:42,660
That made sense to me.
Like,

3019
02:06:42,661 --> 02:06:44,280
oh yeah,
of course is how louis did it,

3020
02:06:44,700 --> 02:06:45,900
you know,
louisa nice guy,

3021
02:06:45,950 --> 02:06:50,950
you know,
and he sort of felt bad that everybody 

3022
02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:50,950
was going after dane,
but you know,

3023
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:53,460
it was what,
it was just weird.

3024
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:55,920
It's just hard for god to recover from 
something like that.

3025
02:06:55,921 --> 02:06:56,360
You know,
when,

3026
02:06:56,361 --> 02:07:01,361
when you get,
when you get a label put on you and you 

3027
02:07:01,361 --> 02:07:03,390
get a lot of people that just decided to
hate you,

3028
02:07:03,650 --> 02:07:06,630
you know,
I'm in zach galifianakis galifianakis.

3029
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:09,750
He had a member,
he used to do it on him.

3030
02:07:09,830 --> 02:07:14,830
I remember he used to do a bit,
well he would have pull out posters at 

3031
02:07:14,830 --> 02:07:15,450
the end and he write things on them and 
one of them was killed.

3032
02:07:15,451 --> 02:07:18,380
Dane cook got a huge laugh,
you know,

3033
02:07:18,390 --> 02:07:19,930
it's like,
it was like,

3034
02:07:20,090 --> 02:07:21,810
it's all sort of agree with can make 
this job.

3035
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:27,480
It was all he.
He became that guy like even though a 

3036
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:30,861
lot of people loved them,
he became the guy that a lot of people 

3037
02:07:30,861 --> 02:07:33,651
fucking hate it and you were clear.
We're in the clear to be able to say 

3038
02:07:33,651 --> 02:07:34,020
whatever you want it.
If you're not doing standup,

3039
02:07:34,021 --> 02:07:36,040
you really not in that world anymore.
You're not

3040
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,230
attached to those people anymore.
You're not feeling their hate anymore.

3041
02:07:38,231 --> 02:07:38,670
You're not,
you know,

3042
02:07:38,671 --> 02:07:39,940
like whatever.
And now you don't.

3043
02:07:39,970 --> 02:07:41,780
Now you have no effect on me.
You know,

3044
02:07:41,930 --> 02:07:44,170
now you have no effect on me.
I'm not doing standup right now.

3045
02:07:44,171 --> 02:07:46,380
You have no effect on me.
Yeah,

3046
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:48,790
I mean,
if you're tired of people,

3047
02:07:48,791 --> 02:07:53,791
just the snarky critic who is just on 
instinct and you know,

3048
02:07:54,621 --> 02:07:58,210
on just a by default they're cunty.
You know,

3049
02:07:58,211 --> 02:08:03,211
there's a Lot of people like that,
but by default looking for something 

3050
02:08:03,211 --> 02:08:05,791
shitty to say.
And when you got a target like kim 

3051
02:08:05,791 --> 02:08:06,100
kardashians or dane cook,
when he was,

3052
02:08:06,101 --> 02:08:11,101
you know,
when people were shitting on him or 

3053
02:08:11,101 --> 02:08:11,101
anybody who's in the news that you is 
like a free shot,

3054
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:16,120
you automatically go after them.
He's going to be a lot of people that 

3055
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:16,950
go,
yeah,

3056
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:19,830
justin bieber,
so he's going to be someone comedy would

3057
02:08:19,890 --> 02:08:21,010
would help that?
Yeah,

3058
02:08:21,011 --> 02:08:22,570
because you're not connected to them 
anymore.

3059
02:08:22,571 --> 02:08:24,250
You're not doIng anything and he's got 
enough money.

3060
02:08:24,251 --> 02:08:29,251
I'm sure that he could just kick back 
and relax for a few years so it doesn't 

3061
02:08:29,251 --> 02:08:33,060
seem like a nutty spender.
So if he can just kick back and relax 

3062
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:33,060
for a few years and maybe while he's 
doing that,

3063
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:34,660
he's writing some stuff that he really 
likes.

3064
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:37,910
He filmed with three movies last year,
so that could also be white.

3065
02:08:37,930 --> 02:08:39,580
Took a year off.
That could be too.

3066
02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:44,750
I know like what beck did an album or a 
really great album called Sea change is 

3067
02:08:44,750 --> 02:08:45,900
all about his relationship with the 
underwriter.

3068
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:47,350
Whoa.
Yeah.

3069
02:08:47,550 --> 02:08:48,690
And he Said though,
he was like,

3070
02:08:48,691 --> 02:08:53,691
I couldn't write it for like two years 
until after we broke up for like a 

3071
02:08:53,691 --> 02:08:56,361
couple of years and then I was able to 
like process my feelings about it and 

3072
02:08:56,361 --> 02:08:59,430
then write this amazing work.
How's wynonna feel about it?

3073
02:08:59,780 --> 02:09:00,810
I don't know.
They tried to reach her,

3074
02:09:00,811 --> 02:09:03,090
but she was too busy stealing shit.
It's a really great album.

3075
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:08,100
It's a good breakup album.
He's a scientologist isn't a 

3076
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:09,330
scientologist show because one's really.
What was that?

3077
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:10,550
It was the knitting factory,
but it was.

3078
02:09:10,610 --> 02:09:14,010
It was a fundraiser for scientology and 
my psychologist friend coming in.

3079
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:15,960
Wow.
You have a scientologist friend.

3080
02:09:16,230 --> 02:09:17,990
Bobby used to have a girlfriend was 
scientologist.

3081
02:09:18,030 --> 02:09:23,030
Okay,
so you're sitting there with all you 

3082
02:09:23,030 --> 02:09:23,030
scientologists in you and bobby.
Wow.

3083
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:26,540
He must have been there too once he 
wasn't available that day and so back

3084
02:09:26,540 --> 02:09:30,050
is doing a show and go like fucking 
scientology rule.

3085
02:09:30,070 --> 02:09:35,070
We didn't really talk about it.
When you see a car accident you have to 

3086
02:09:35,070 --> 02:09:39,581
pull over because you're a scientologist
and you're the only one that's going to 

3087
02:09:39,581 --> 02:09:39,581
know what time.

3088
02:09:39,581 --> 02:09:39,581
Well,
it could help.

3089
02:09:39,610 --> 02:09:41,040
I just think it'd be too bad if you 
like.

3090
02:09:41,110 --> 02:09:46,110
Dane cook.
Is that the way he talks about comedy 

3091
02:09:46,110 --> 02:09:46,110
and the way he like.
He's been 20 years in the game to lose a

3092
02:09:46,160 --> 02:09:48,240
pro.
Like a professional man.

3093
02:09:48,430 --> 02:09:50,390
It's too bad it doesn't.

3094
02:09:50,490 --> 02:09:51,820
Well,
who knows if he's losing it,

3095
02:09:51,821 --> 02:09:53,350
maybe he's just taken a year off,
you know,

3096
02:09:53,351 --> 02:09:54,610
maybe he just.
Seriously,

3097
02:09:54,611 --> 02:09:59,611
he is on a tv show.
He never took time off.

3098
02:10:00,190 --> 02:10:05,190
Nobody.
There's a big difference between doing 

3099
02:10:05,190 --> 02:10:05,190
all these movies and.
Yeah.

3100
02:10:05,190 --> 02:10:06,430
And taking time off of standup.
Not coming up with a new album,

3101
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:11,140
doing any standup in la guys take two 
weeks off and it's a big deal.

3102
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:13,450
You know,
two weeks is kind of shaky.

3103
02:10:13,451 --> 02:10:14,500
You come back,
you're a little,

3104
02:10:14,501 --> 02:10:16,610
you know,
you got to do like one set of week.

3105
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:18,590
Well I got,
I got tuesday,

3106
02:10:18,591 --> 02:10:23,591
wednesday this week at the store.
They're going to be gone in Brazil for 

3107
02:10:23,591 --> 02:10:23,591
the rest.
I only got,

3108
02:10:23,591 --> 02:10:24,110
that's what I called him for it.
I only got one spot and I was like,

3109
02:10:24,111 --> 02:10:26,280
no,
I'm not gonna be able to get along until

3110
02:10:26,330 --> 02:10:31,330
tuesday.
I had to call my [inaudible] is on the 

3111
02:10:31,330 --> 02:10:31,330
book cover now you got to let me slide 
in.

3112
02:10:31,330 --> 02:10:31,330
Oh,
okay.

3113
02:10:31,330 --> 02:10:33,200
You use your a while,
but not once in a while.

3114
02:10:33,201 --> 02:10:34,100
Only when you need to though.

3115
02:10:34,110 --> 02:10:36,170
I'm saying there's no way.
You go off like a year with nothing.

3116
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:39,350
Who's making that fucking list at the 
comedy store?

3117
02:10:39,650 --> 02:10:41,300
It's fine.
Not to get me one day out of the way.

3118
02:10:41,301 --> 02:10:44,240
Silly fucks.
I'm running a new hour this year.

3119
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:44,970
oh yeah?
Yeah.

3120
02:10:45,070 --> 02:10:46,590
Are you throwing your old one out?
What are you doing?

3121
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:50,190
Done chuck and done.
Did you make a dvd or a cd?

3122
02:10:50,470 --> 02:10:55,470
Can make a dvd son.
Can't throw Your material out without a 

3123
02:10:55,470 --> 02:10:55,470
fucking visual representation of it.
Yeah.

3124
02:10:55,940 --> 02:10:57,560
A lot of your Shit is visual.
Yeah.

3125
02:10:58,220 --> 02:11:01,340
Maybe get some of the.
Hire someone film you cheap prick.

3126
02:11:01,700 --> 02:11:03,620

3127
02:11:04,450 --> 02:11:05,960
Release it to people.
Yeah.

Give it to the world already.
Make a video like a video.

You can't just have an audio.
My first cd was there.

3131
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:16,790
I was upset that some of my shit wasn't 
visual.

3132
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:21,260
So videos of it and release them to put 
it online after the fact.

3133
02:11:21,670 --> 02:11:22,250
Yeah.

3134
02:11:22,251 --> 02:11:25,860

3135
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:29,630
That's,
that's a lot of visual in that boom.

3136
02:11:29,930 --> 02:11:32,480
You know,

02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:35,090
Yeah.
That's visual.

3139
02:11:35,150 --> 02:11:38,930
You need that part.
That's a big part of why it's funny with

3140
02:11:38,950 --> 02:11:43,950
the party tonight,
which is what happens when a woman's 

3141
02:11:43,950 --> 02:11:43,950
vagina and she gets it.
yeah.

3142
02:11:43,950 --> 02:11:44,300
Yeah.
Don't say anymore.

3143
02:11:44,330 --> 02:11:46,190
There was a kid that would be a little 
visual.

3144
02:11:46,250 --> 02:11:47,240
Very,
very visual.

3145
02:11:47,330 --> 02:11:48,830
Yeah.
The fuck ari.

3146
02:11:51,130 --> 02:11:56,130

02:12:02,870 --> 02:12:04,310
The 27th.
Is it that weekend?

3152
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:05,600
Twenty fifth is my ninth.
Yeah,

3153
02:12:05,720 --> 02:12:08,000
I'm going to be in there.
Still some tickets available,

3154
02:12:08,001 --> 02:12:11,780
but they're going fast pitches.
Joey diaz and duncan trussell.

3155
02:12:11,781 --> 02:12:16,781
We're going to be at the chicago theater
on January 27th and if you see joey 

3156
02:12:16,781 --> 02:12:21,040
onstage,
joey will probably be not walking so 

3157
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:21,350
good because he's just going to have 
surgery 10 days before that.

3158
02:12:21,650 --> 02:12:23,210
It's gonna.
Get one of those scooters.

3159
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:28,490
Scooters.
But because if anybody wants to get them

3160
02:12:28,491 --> 02:12:31,720
some flowers and say get well cards,
get well.

3161
02:12:31,721 --> 02:12:32,810
Joey flowers.
Give me the,

3162
02:12:32,811 --> 02:12:35,480
can I get out of here with this fucking 
cards and flowers.

3163
02:12:35,510 --> 02:12:39,740
Just giving him a lot that gave me an 
envelope of cash in it or nothing.

3164
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:42,440
Um,
so yeah,

3165
02:12:42,441 --> 02:12:45,350
so joey will be there supposedly.
I hope he's going to be able to make it,

3166
02:12:45,351 --> 02:12:48,170
but he's getting surgery 10 days before.
Yeah,

3167
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:50,090
pretty tight.
Tight scheduling.

3168
02:12:50,410 --> 02:12:52,340
Dunkin's going to be there for sure.
I'll be there.

3169
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:54,680
And then there's the ufc on fox is the 
next day.

3170
02:12:54,681 --> 02:12:59,681
You can see that.
Or if you are closer to my man already 

3171
02:12:59,681 --> 02:13:02,020
should fear you go to minneapolis and go
to the house of comedy.net.

3172
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:04,360
How's a comedy.net?
And it will be that weekend.

3173
02:13:04,610 --> 02:13:07,790
How many days you there?
Five days.

3174
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,110
Five days.
Damn.

3175
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:11,690
That's nice.
That's time for a relationship.

3176
02:13:13,210 --> 02:13:17,160
You could meet a new girl and fall in 
love and then totally hate each other by

3177
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:20,240
the 27th roles.
We're at the nexus of it.

3178
