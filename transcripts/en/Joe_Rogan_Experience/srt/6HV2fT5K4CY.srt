1
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,623
Okay.

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,633
What?

3
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,653
Huh?

4
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,743
Cool.

5
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,080
[inaudible]

6
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,800
ladies and gentlemen, brothers
and sisters. Lovers and children.

7
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,270
Dana d mom does in the house.
Give it up for Dana.

8
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,880
Dana and I are e pals.
We tweet each other back and forth,

9
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:32,650
but this is our first time actually
meeting each other in real life. Cool.

10
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,661
You're very funny.

11
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:37,890
You say some funny shit on Twitter and
you said you had a really fun thing where

12
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,060
you broke down this Jennifer
Anniston. Uh, again. Uh,

13
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,170
what's his name? Adam Sandler
movie. It was really funny.

14
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,360
Yeah. If you haven't seen it, you can
get it done. It's on youtube. On your,

15
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,630
what does it, does it say just don't go
with it. Just don't go with it. Yeah,

16
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,230
I'm really funny and really
like you, you, you know,

17
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:02,200
you broke it down like comic would
break it down like how ridiculous it is.

18
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,711
First of all,

19
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:05,620
I thought it was hilarious that you
said that Jennifer Aniston was the human

20
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,370
equivalent to okay.

21
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,430
Meal meal

22
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,230
like perfect.
That is absolutely perfect.

23
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,880
Nutritious. I would've said
grilled cheese sandwich thing.

24
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,940
I would have called her a grilled grilled
cheese, grilled cheese sandwich truck.

25
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:24,180
You don't see an oatmeal track anywhere?
No lines.

26
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,750
I would give her more credit with meals.
What I'm saying,

27
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,770
I think you being a little unfair.
I will.

28
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:33,790
I'll give her a little more than oatmeal,
but I know what you're saying. You know,

29
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,540
I'm wondering,
I got this no love for Jennifer Aniston.

30
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,430
She's just a chick trying to get
some money doing her acting things,

31
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,420
viral smartwater video and she's trying
to like be with all the youtubers and

32
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:49,670
like make a viral video
to go smart water thing.

33
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
She ain't hurting anybody. Yeah. Yeah.

34
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,410
It's easy to get caught up in hating
someone for no reason. And she's,

35
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,900
she's not somebody.

36
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,930
Well why her Jennifer Kell go after
Kadafi Kadafi is going to leave her dash,

37
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,660
go off the car, gas, you know, NASA. Do
you feel about that? But then you know,

38
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,110
I mean it's also, you know, if you live
in a glass house, don't throw rocks,

39
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,910
like live your own fucking life. Who
gives a shit? But you're right. Her stuff,

40
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:18,600
what she's doing, it's all like, God
damn bitch, don't you have enough money?

41
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:21,840
They want to do some
interesting now everything you
fucking do is like the same.

42
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Goddamn Laurie.

43
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,690
You know those romance and did the
worst date movies ever. Because if you,

44
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,940
you're going on this date,

45
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:33,450
if you're a guy you're already giving in
to the fact that you're doing whatever

46
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:34,770
you can to fuck you're,
you're gonna,

47
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:36,840
you're gonna pretend to be someone
you're not. You're going to like,

48
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:41,841
I would never ask a check to go see some
crazy fucking stupid werewolf movie if

49
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:44,310
they weren't into it. You know
what I mean? I would've never,

50
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,320
but women can ask a guy to go see
some wonky ass date night bullshit.

51
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:53,150
Jennifer Aniston. God Forbid Sandra
Bullock movies. Those motherfuckers, Huh?

52
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Sandy [inaudible] Mars.
Every little sandy you love.

53
00:04:57,241 --> 00:05:01,280
Say that because of what happened to her.
Yeah. I was just gonna say exactly why.

54
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:05,450
Right. I was going to bitch about no
strings attached to cause Natalie Portman.

55
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:09,640
You have an Oscar, but still making
bullshit like no strings attached.

56
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,590
Poor me.
I'm the most attractive person ever.

57
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,470
Me and Ashton Kutcher were going to
have no strings attached sex. Boom.

58
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,690
They can fuck anybody anywhere,
any day of the week.

59
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,340
A new person every single day, and they're
going to make a fucking hat. Yes. Oh,

60
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,270
we're just going to be friends and
have sex and it won't get complicated.

61
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,470
I wonder what's going to happen?
Well, do they fall in love?

62
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,160
You're the girl. You have to understand
what happens. She, she's sitting around,

63
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:41,800
her agent calls them, this is what we
have for you. It's a big movie. It's blah,

64
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,370
blah, blah. Everyone's all hyped
on it and next thing you know,

65
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,550
like I've read for shit that I really,
I'm happy I never gone.

66
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,370
He could just get talked into going in
on these things. The next thing you know,

67
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:52,550
you're in an office. Next thing
you know you're signing the papers.

68
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,650
Next thing you know a movie set and
you're doing this fucking terrible movie.

69
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,810
You know boo hoo cry for you. No big
deal. But I'm just saying they're just,

70
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,420
they're just out there doing their shit.
She looks fantastic

71
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,750
pregnant. They should do that
movie though, where it's like,

72
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,360
it's sold like that where you know
exactly what's going to happen.

73
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:08,590
They're going to fall in love and cheap,

74
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:10,630
but then it's actually
like he murders her.

75
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,730
Larry's his body, like an
alien. He only wants her eggs.

76
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,720
That would be a good idea for
a movie trailer. I saw, um, uh,

77
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,120
what was it called? Um, bureau. What
the fuck's it called? Adjustment Bureau.

78
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,880
I am so behind in movies right now.
I don't even know what this is.

79
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,270
God Damn decent. It's a based
on a Phillip K. Dot. Dick novel.

80
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:34,530
So it was really weird. It was really
trippy. I like really surprising.

81
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:38,580
Like I thought it was just going to be
a s uh, a typical dumb movie and it was,

82
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,230
there had a lot,
there's a lot of dumb elements,

83
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,530
but you kind of have to have some
dumb shit and a lot of movies.

84
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:47,000
Just to wrap up a complicated premise
inside of two hours right now you've got

85
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:51,600
to have some one guy that's
that thing. It's also like,

86
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:54,380
what is his motivation
when he's ridiculously in
love with her and you know,

87
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,550
barely, you know, well why is
this going on? Really? Wow.

88
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,670
I mean C'mon really,

89
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:02,700
I mean your dwell on this shift three
years later because it's meant to be and

90
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:05,480
it's all written down somewhere. It
was fascinating. We went about it

91
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,060
wrack my brain over back to the future
and that's like from 1985 and I'm like

92
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,280
still things bother me about it so
much like the time or almost nothing.

93
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,870
The rape part like so we've
been back to the future. Yeah.

94
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,250
Beth tries to rape
Lorraine and that's right.

95
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,580
And the alternate future that really
don't have them like wash his car,

96
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,370
the stuff like, you know, it's weird in
that time you tried to wake me up. Great.

97
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,770
I like, I like it bothers me some really.
I never even thought about that. But yes,

98
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:35,670
that again I do take a lot of medicine,

99
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,060
kind of hone in on that kind of stuff.
What about the rapes?

100
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,400
I don't remember anything about
that movie. I, you know, I'm,

101
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:45,730
I'm finding as I get older,

102
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:49,390
like I've definitely used up hard drive
space and deleted a lot of files because

103
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:52,300
I would watch movies now and it's
like I never watched it before.

104
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,180
I watched a simple mind
the other day, the, the uh,

105
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:58,630
the Russell Crowe movie about that
genius mathematician, Beautiful Mind,

106
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,870
simple mind,
beautiful minds and it was fucking great.

107
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:04,960
I had no idea what was going to happen.
I literally didn't remember the movie,

108
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,920
but I know I've seen it. I'm
just, I've known amount of
space. I got no space, man.

109
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,500
That's what,
like that's social network.

110
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,840
That's what's going to happen with
that movie to me and like 10 years,

111
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:16,680
like it was a great movie, but that's
not a movie you'll remember at all

112
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,700
are so many movies, man. If you
really stop, you know, it's like,

113
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,100
and I was going to ask you
this because you, you do porn.

114
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,500
Like why the fuck are they
still making porn movies?

115
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,440
There's just no way you
could've seen them. All right?

116
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,620
There's no way you need a new one
if you're really just beating off.

117
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,670
There's no way, unless you're
fixating on very specific actresses,

118
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:37,680
which a lot of guys do,
but if you're not,

119
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:40,550
if you're just beating off Jesus Christ,
that's when I seen them all.

120
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,700
That's one thing I've noticed though.
It is the characters. It is you've, you,

121
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:46,450
you like a certain actress and
you start wanting to see it.

122
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:49,360
Like before horn was always
to me porn was jacking off,

123
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,410
but then I never really
got into characters since
like Twitter where now I'm

124
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:56,160
following people on Twitter
and stuff that now I'm starting

125
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,960
to get them though I wouldn't see
a movie with that person. And Yeah,

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,690
so I see that now that Twitter is helping
it at a little bit. Yeah, that's, that's,

127
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,020
that's definitely what's become a mean.
It's become that with comics as well,

128
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,800
you know,
it's like people reaching out and you,

129
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:12,780
you develop like your fan base and then
you all communicate with each other.

130
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,990
And then I guess when some dudes walking
off too, it's like much more personal,

131
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,020
you know, are more fun. Kind of
feel like they own you a little bit,

132
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,460
a little bit disconcerting. Did people
get douchey with you because of that?

133
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,380
Like I'm a fan.
Like I demand this

134
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,000
even like today coming here,
um, people are like, uh,

135
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,960
it's Joe Rogan going to fuck you.
And I'm like, I'm a person. Like,

136
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:38,230
you know like you have your thing.
Isn't that when you're done that in the,

137
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,440
you know,
it's just like this isn't a movie.

138
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:44,040
This is real life and you have your
real life and outside of comedy and your

139
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,570
podcast and MMA stuff and TV and movies.

140
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,760
You have your own personal life.
Right?

141
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,350
Me Outside of my Twitter feed,
my bath aid,

142
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,020
but my bathtub thing
like what's your mouth?

143
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,540
I just spend like five
hours a day in the bathtub.

144
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,110
You just sit around the taking not get
clean enough or are you one of those?

145
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,440
Oh all I've done so much porn constantly.
Just never ever cleaned.

146
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,300
Do it on like a Webcam or
something? No, I just like, no,

147
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,370
I'm looking bad to be in the tub.

148
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,730
You should do it on web cause there is
there a psychological thing there or are

149
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:19,670
you just like to do it?
Yeah, just comfortable. Just
feels good to be on the top.

150
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,370
Yeah. I'm not wearing clothes
and gives me from eating,

151
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,760
taking food in the Bathtub is growth.

152
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,340
He's get an isolation tank that's part
of the cat man. That'd be awesome.

153
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,600
When the cat in the hat comes back.

154
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,850
That's where he starts trouble
each cake in a, in a tub.

155
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,550
See that's where it's all done properly.
That mother Fucker,

156
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,730
those little kids in trouble almost and
then he pulls it out with magic at the

157
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:43,610
very end.
So yeah,

158
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:46,560
most people don't eat in the bathtub
while you're up to date with your cat in

159
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:50,480
the hat. Shit son. I have
a two and a half year old.

160
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,870
I know she loves the cat in
the hat and I love reading it.

161
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:57,050
Like I get all enthusiastic about it.
It's fucking great writing.

162
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,600
That's a cat in the hat.
Especially the cat in the hat comes back.

163
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:03,170
That one is the shit medicine Shel
Silverstein yet. No Man. What?

164
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:05,990
Just like walk in and get that. You
will fucking love it. It'll be great.

165
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,980
You will read that shit as a kid.
The chat and the hat seems awful.

166
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:14,180
Psychedelic magic kind of has
got a crazy hat and magic.

167
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,030
Fuck Michel Silverstein.
I'm not about,

168
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,710
I'm not interested in man.
You're talking nonsense.

169
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:24,110
I'm telling you about something awesome
and you're telling me about something

170
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:26,210
else that I have no idea what it is.
Very similar.

171
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,560
Let's talk about what's awesome.
I don't want to hear about the chivalry.

172
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:34,010
Chad the how does the shit son,
he's a cat with a magic fucking hat.

173
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,730
He pulls his cat off and there's little
cat, a little cat a pulls his hat off,

174
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,040
there's little cat B look at,
see and it gets all the way down.

175
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,850
A little cat Z and little cat Z has volume
and you don't know what the fuck loom

176
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:45,620
is,
but boom fixes everything.

177
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,160
And when it gets down to the little cat
z with the fucking shit hits the fan.

178
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:52,730
When the cat fucks everything up,
he gets to the tub dirty.

179
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,760
He gets pink shit out in the snow and
on the $10 shoes and on mom's dress and

180
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,620
everything is a fucking disaster.

181
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,160
And he keeps pulling out little hats so
other cats can help them and they just

182
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:06,950
fuck shit up. Worse and worse until
it gets a little cat Z and little cat.

183
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,750
He's got the reset, reset switch.
He pulls out, boom and boom,

184
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:14,860
just bang. No matter what and
you look at Czi is so small,

185
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:19,360
you can't even fucking see him. He's
not visible to the naked eye. Okay,

186
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,160
so they're going macrocosm
on your ass band. They're
going quantum physics, right?

187
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:27,170
That's how bad ass cat in the
head is so fucked. Your stupid.

188
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,270
What was her name again?
This is shell silver's.

189
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,030
Shel Silverstein construct the cat
in the hat's car. How about that?

190
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,860
That's what I got to say. I need to,
I need this. The cat naps is a shit.

191
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,080
I need to have some kids because I
haven't read this shit in a while.

192
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,450
You know when you don't have kids.

193
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:47,590
The idea of reading kids cat and that
story sounds like fucking painful

194
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:51,730
punishment. People. I've, when I've been
in the position where I didn't have kids,

195
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:55,630
where I looked at people at kids like, oh,
you trapped fucked. Like, oh my God. Oh,

196
00:12:55,631 --> 00:13:00,610
you're doomed. You're stuck to that trip
forever. There's no way not to. We not to.

197
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,960
It's normal if you don't have kids.

198
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:04,750
That's how it's supposed to be set
up until you have them. Of Your own,

199
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,170
you're supposed to like to, to complete
your mission in life. Like your,

200
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:11,890
your motivation and your goals are
to be as uninstalled as possible.

201
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,290
So when you see entanglements
and other people's lives,

202
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,230
you recognize them as disgusting things
you never want to see in yourself.

203
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,041
That's why like you see,

204
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,430
like if someone's acting like an asshole
or someone's acting selfish or jealous,

205
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,850
those feelings that you get from seeing,
they'll be like, oh, it's so gross.

206
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,580
That's a message to you that's
you're supposed to learn from this.

207
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,010
And you're supposed to never
ever be what that person is.

208
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,530
I guess they're there for you.
And when you see people with kids,

209
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:35,470
if they're not yours,
you get to this a screwy message.

210
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,630
You get this message of all,
look at this poor fuck.

211
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,050
And you think about all the worst aspects
of all your relationships and how you

212
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:43,540
know you could possibly be entangled.
Some other person.

213
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,510
And then there's a fucking kid wants
stop crying at all you're doing.

214
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,880
But when you have them, all
of a sudden it's like, Whoa,

215
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:53,560
there's this little human and they're
your little friends. And it's you like,

216
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:55,930
it's not really another person.

217
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,740
It's a part of you that's
become its own individual.

218
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,180
You love it literally more than you love
yourself and then reading to them and

219
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:07,570
playing with them. It's fun. It's fuck.
It's like you've got this little pal,

220
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,540
like she makes me laugh all the time.
She shows me her dumps.

221
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,360
She takes these giant shits.
They're fucking huge.

222
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,420
They come out of this little tiny body.
Can't believe how big are shits are.

223
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,000
You should start twittering.
It's her twin. No Way.

224
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,130
It would be jerking off to my baby shit.

225
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,810
If they fixed that, they
fixed my cock. Oh, of course.

226
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:33,040
There would be at least like five guys.
If you showed how big your baby shit was,

227
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,180
what else could I fit in that ass?
They were thinking about stuff in their

228
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,500
kid's poop today, Joe. Exactly. There's
at least one guy who's going to say that,

229
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,600
but she thinks it's hilarious.
She goes,

230
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:48,601
I just made a poop log and poop is what
she knows is funny because it's funny

231
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:52,130
coming out of a two year old,
so that's like the Goto word.

232
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,740
Yeah, no. Whenever you know.
What does it smell like? Poop.

233
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,090
Everything smells like poop.

234
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,430
Like she'll say everything smells
like poop and laugh. That's awesome.

235
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,050
You gotta get, you gotta get her in on
it. There's a show called a venture time.

236
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:07,520
I highly recommend it. It's like a,
it's like a trippy show for kids,

237
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,750
but if you're an adult you will fucking
want to get high and watch it. Amazing.

238
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,970
Yeah. Really? Yeah,

239
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,840
it's the next Maria Bamford on it.

240
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,510
Steve Agee said that
he did something on it,

241
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,250
like a bunch of really talented people.

242
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,450
It's really cool to flapjack a flapjack
got canceled, so now he's on it too.

243
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,350
Fucking awesome. Would you ever
do a cartoon voice? I think,

244
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,460
I think that would be one of your ideal
things. I think I have, but we did it.

245
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:37,580
You did a family guy or American dad
or something like that, you remember?

246
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,400
Well, I did it. Yeah. I did a cartoon
voice on family guy and I did um,

247
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,890
fuck what else I had done
with the little kid. Shit.

248
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,990
I feel like I've done something before.

249
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,790
I've read some books or read some books
that we became like books on CD long

250
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:55,360
time ago with Mario Lopez. Oh no
way. Yeah. It was kind of fun man.

251
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:59,710
Cause you're reading a Kid's story and re
yeah,

252
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,390
it's hot as fuck. Um, and I
always remember like, you know,

253
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:08,320
like how much I was a little kid to like
listen to like a sat of someone tell a

254
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:10,060
story. Right. It was like fucking cool.

255
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:13,450
It'd be tucked in bed and you hear
some really exciting story, you know,

256
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,070
so it was fun.
It was fun doing,

257
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,010
speaking of Lopez,
you remember when we had Alison on she,

258
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:21,960
she was a extra behind Mario Lopez and
she was just staring at him like she was

259
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:26,160
like the terminator with this really evil,
well she's done it again,

260
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:27,630
but this time she did it even better.

261
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:30,780
Like at the beginning they like high five
when they come back from a commercial

262
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,010
Mario Lopez and her,

263
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,650
and then she immediately goes right
back into the character and she's just

264
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:38,300
staring at him down and looking,
but she overdid it. This, she might,

265
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,800
she's overdoing it this time.
Just acting. Be Crazy on TV,

266
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,620
so it's middle of what is going
on with that chick. Exactly.

267
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,040
Exactly.
The first time I met her

268
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,350
and she was a Brian, she's
very nice, very nice person.

269
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,290
First Time I met her I'm like, dude, is
that girl angry like what's going on man?

270
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,110
I feel like, did I upset her? Then
I say something rude and I'm like,

271
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,190
I don't even remember. I remember
interacting. She's got this mean face,

272
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,053
but then she's super

273
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,750
yes, because the person that every, she
just gets lost in overthought I think.

274
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:09,450
You know, like she's constantly, you
know, just thinking about things and then

275
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,060
she looks angry. It's called
winning, winning, winning,

276
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,750
winning. It was Charlie Sheen. Meme
was hit a, it's turned a corner.

277
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,440
Turned a corner. I watched the podcast
and also this is not fun anymore.

278
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:25,250
There was, there's two, there's three
now, but there's two different versions.

279
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:28,160
There's one where he actually
tries to do like a talk show.

280
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:33,490
It's very strange and it's very cocaine
because everyone in the room is like all

281
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:39,290
happy and laughing at nonsense and there's
this one guy who won't stop playing

282
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,090
fart sounds. It's like, you know,

283
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:44,240
he probably listen to the Howard stern
show up twice and you know and said,

284
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,290
oh well this is probably all it tastes
fucking fart board and this guy's blown

285
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,310
off farts in the for no reason

286
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,040
whatsoever.
And Charlie's like reading off Cue cards,

287
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,340
just trying to have those synapses
fire in some sort of a reasonable and

288
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:03,300
understandable sequence cause it
just cocaine madness in that brain.

289
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,610
His brain is ravaged,
dude,

290
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,900
he's got blow out holes in
walls and water's leaking out.

291
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,660
No one knows what the fuck happens.
Your brain,

292
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:16,440
when you blow seven fucking gram rocks,
you're,

293
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:20,880
you're snorting them and smoking
them for years and years. He's fried.

294
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,690
He's barely trying to keep it together.
What if this is all a set up for a movie?

295
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,460
It would be a million fucking this
movie. Yeah. I mean maybe not. Maybe not.

296
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:34,050
Maybe the best way. Never ever be on
Charlie Sheen Bandwagon. Fuck him.

297
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,760
Why? Why is he there? I Dunno. That's
the best way to get people mad.

298
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:41,820
I think it's just to be like I'm
not into what you're into. Fuck.

299
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:45,730
You actually have not been watching
or following any of it. I feel like I,

300
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,100
there's no reward in that for me. But
there was a real board and following it,

301
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,080
there's a reward and studying it.

302
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:55,800
Like he's some fucking Lewis and
Clark of cocaine and whores, you know,

303
00:18:55,801 --> 00:19:00,470
he's like out there in the woods and you
know and shit in the [inaudible] been

304
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,230
around for very,
very long time,

305
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:07,140
but no one's been able to rock it like
2.2 mil Olia about two mil a week is how

306
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:11,400
you discover something new.
He's got radical amounts of
money, syndication money.

307
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,050
And when you have that kind of money,

308
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:17,310
that's how there's dudes show up with
briefcases and shit and you know,

309
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:20,770
and there's 50 girls in the
room. He's, he's doing it,

310
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,170
he's doing other level shit cause you're
not supposed to get that rich and still

311
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:27,610
have this crazy appetite
for cocaine and horse. You,

312
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,160
you're not supposed to
be that open about it.

313
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,700
You know it's supposed to be that
public about it, but that's what,

314
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:34,890
that's what's crazy is that,
that's exactly where TV's going.

315
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:39,891
This whole shit is supposedly supposedly
this is the realist you can get for

316
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:41,550
reality shows.

317
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,350
Now it's having a use stream channel and
seeing somebody's about to die except

318
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,230
maybe you know.
Oh yeah.

319
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,110
The whole thing is fucking fake something
and directed by Shel Silverstein and

320
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:55,680
this is going to like the next biggest
movie ever. Dude. It's fucking,

321
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,450
it's so scary when you look at his
body and its face like the latest ones,

322
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,450
the latest two. It looks like he
hasn't eaten or slept in days.

323
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:08,350
Like his skin is loose on his face.
He looks like an old man. Yeah, I'm,

324
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,230
it's because he's lost all this
weight. How old? Look at them.

325
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,940
It looks like older than
me and I don't know.

326
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,590
I know I don't look like
I did when I was young.

327
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,810
I look at myself when I was young
and I'm like, wow, how weird is that?

328
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:23,070
Like that's me. I'm decaying,
you know? I'm like, my body
is morphing and changing,

329
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,500
but I look better than that dude.
Yeah.

330
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:30,330
That looks like Hugh Hefner to Hugh Hefner
right there. Yeah. That's an old man.

331
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,190
There's like a 60 year old man,
by the way.

332
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:35,800
We're looking on Ustream that he has his
whole, all his videos and channels. Uh,

333
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,650
his name is w y t r on Ustream.
And uh,

334
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,490
this is Wy TV, Bro. TV,
you know, here's the,

335
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:48,010
I think that's just one of them that's
on, I mean I think you can, you can watch

336
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,990
the actual Charlie Sheen went
on Charlie Sheen's channel.

337
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:52,990
This is the guy who was a re re
competent. Oh. It looks like,

338
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:56,110
but this one almost has a million
views, so yeah, this might be it. Okay.

339
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:58,300
Maybe it is it, but, well, here's
what disturbs me. Look at it.

340
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:02,840
The pointiness of the shoulder. Look at
the bones. Yeah. That's weird. He's dying.

341
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:07,600
He's dying. Yeah, that's, that's real.
You know, he's dying and he's winning.

342
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,520
Yeah. He looks like he looks like
Steve Jobs right there. Yeah.

343
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,470
Oh, livers. Friends playing.
Yeah. Maybe that's what it is.

344
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,930
Maybe that's why is all this horror.
Isn't his house there?

345
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,050
He's like Madison or Oregon.
I'm on Zubich Charlie.

346
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,190
I used to say that about Dick Cheney.

347
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,540
Dick Cheney probably has like seven secret
service agents but only six are real

348
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,410
circuit service agents.

349
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:33,030
One guy was just some dude who's
got his blood type waiting,

350
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,520
harvesting Dick Cheney to die so they're
going to cut this dude open like a fish

351
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,420
harvesters.

352
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,960
One guy behind them with a truck with
ice in it and it's ready to throw the

353
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:44,120
heart in there while it's still beating.
What blood type are all those whores?

354
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,330
Do you guys know what you are?
Okay.

355
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:49,990
I don't even know what blood type I
think I have like a cat blood type or

356
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:52,950
something. Okay. Oh positive. Positive.

357
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,680
[inaudible] is the only one here
that's not high. She was scared.

358
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,710
She didn't want to go deep.
We'll nervous.

359
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,300
I am a little nervous.
It's very hard to be.

360
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:07,510
Same Room with people who are
professionally funny because not funny.

361
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:11,800
I could just fucking open my
ass and like accepted huge cop,

362
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,250
you know and then everything will be okay.
Things will pan out for me.

363
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,100
Everybody would like you.
Yeah.

364
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,890
Hello. Say Well I'll wait to go. Yeah.
Cause I can fall back on just, you know,

365
00:22:21,891 --> 00:22:25,490
being pretty enough. You don't have to
worry about anything. Just be yourself.

366
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,420
You don't have to be funny.

367
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:29,690
You don't have to be just right back to
you because I like to be in. You are,

368
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:31,870
but you know what,
no more than you have to be like the,

369
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,170
the beautiful thing about this podcast
for real is that it's like a conversation.

370
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,501
You know,

371
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:40,730
it's like when people get a chance to
see is it's like you get an in on, uh,

372
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:43,330
an interesting conversation, you
know? And so just for yourself,

373
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,450
so you're all good. That's enough to just
be funny. But you are, you are funny.

374
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,670
And if you haven't seen that clip,
it's very funny.

375
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,050
Have you ever thought about doing comedy?

376
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,200
Um,

377
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,480
I don't know cause it's kind of hard
because I'm like already socially,

378
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,760
uh, social and marginalized
by being a sex worker.

379
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:06,080
And then people kind of
expect you to be like sexy.

380
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:10,790
And then I already had this conversation
with Brian about female comics and how

381
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:12,500
it's like,
that's already,

382
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,150
you're kind of a run down on the
ladder because you, you know,

383
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,710
my boyfriend, my period, my
cats, you know, kind of stuff.

384
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:26,420
And it's really hard to get out of
that. It's uh, that is a business.

385
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:31,310
It's very hard for women and
somebody like me coming in,

386
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,000
uh, like being pretty and
being a porn star and you know,

387
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:37,100
being like having a
dirty mouth or whatever,

388
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:40,340
I feel like I'd be kind of painted into
a certain corner of being expected.

389
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,700
How can you be painted more
than you are ready? I know.

390
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:48,410
That's why I'm so as a porn, how could
do and be in a female comic, which is,

391
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:50,650
I mean arguably the general consensus,

392
00:23:50,651 --> 00:23:54,590
it would be a notch many notches
above on the social ladder.

393
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:59,060
Like how would it possibly fuck you up
by being funny as well as doing what you

394
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:03,650
already do. Maybe I'm just afraid
of failing to be that right.

395
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,260
I mean it's, it's very
intimidating. Like, I,

396
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,300
I do like your comedy bits for videos
and stuff like that and people can have

397
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:13,560
always call me cause they need like a,

398
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:18,460
a pretty girl or a naked girl or someone
will do a full frontal and whatever and

399
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:23,070
I could explore and I get jokes
and stuff like that. But um,

400
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,900
you know,
I don't know if I can just be like,

401
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:30,580
here are my series of jokes and then
try to like change it from, you know,

402
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,410
I feel like it would have to fall back
on being a porn star for the basis of my

403
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:35,921
comedy,

404
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:40,921
which is something that is kind of
counter productive to what I do as a porn

405
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:45,820
star because I sort of market myself as
a girl next door and a normal person,

406
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,130
you know?
So it'd be like folded in on it.

407
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,160
No.
Would,

408
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,040
I really don't think it would because
you would just be yourself on stage.

409
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,063
I need that.

410
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,090
That's fine. Maybe we're
not the same light, I think.

411
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,900
I think what you said or you
know, saying, I don't know,

412
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,300
I was going to help you
just reading your tweets.

413
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:07,460
I think you're fucking hilarious.
And even if you just took,

414
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:10,760
what I do is I usually think of a tweet
that I really like and then I've tried

415
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,710
to write a little story around that tweak.

416
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,090
Is that pretty much is
the meat of the goal

417
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,740
are, or though, I'm sorry, what was that?

418
00:25:16,741 --> 00:25:19,260
Opened that up so we can see what we're
seeing. We're, we're doing just in case.

419
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,390
Yeah,

420
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,300
but that's like the meat of a joke,
you know, like a tweet it tweet.

421
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:26,000
It pretty much is the best part
of a joke usually, you know?

422
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:28,760
So I think you'd be really good at
it. Just based on your, on your,

423
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,450
what a tweet is, is just
140 characters. Just writing
material, you know? It's just,

424
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,470
it's, it's just, and, and not, and not,
that's the beautiful thing about it.

425
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:40,580
Sometimes it's just whatever the fuck
you think about anything. You know,

426
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:41,960
like I was talking about like I,

427
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:44,880
I made a tweet last night that I was
watching this Charlie sheen thing and then

428
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:49,030
he sounds like hunter s Thompson
[inaudible] boys, you know,

429
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,920
he's got this crazy nutty Gonzo thing
going on. I'm like, wow, this is weird.

430
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:56,010
Like now I'm stuck.
Is that like a drug thing?

431
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,340
It's not like you just go too far
over the edge and you just, you know,

432
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:01,950
everything's firing all fucking goofy.
Is that what it is?

433
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:06,100
Well Charlie Sheen has been famous pretty
much all his life and he was like born

434
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:07,420
into a famous family too.

435
00:26:07,421 --> 00:26:11,590
So I mean that kind of sets you back a
little bit to begin with because you're

436
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:16,000
already scrutinized and being watched
pretty closely and you're in a bubble

437
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:20,680
because you're rich or poor from the
moment you're born basically. Yeah.

438
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,950
What standup comedy makes
you do is be real as fuck.

439
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,330
You can't fake it. You can't pretend
something's going on. It's not going on.

440
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,420
And what's happening is happening.
And when you're talking about something,

441
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,030
you better be actually thinking about
something or those little animals out

442
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:37,250
there are going to smell it.
But I know and it's not going to work

443
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:42,030
like me. Fucking happy heckler. I'm no
worse. Yeah, you heckled Mike Young.

444
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,490
I know it so funny though.

445
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,910
It was entertaining to like the 11
people that were there. Well listen,

446
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:52,560
Mike Young needs it. He needs it just
as long as you don't do that to anybody.

447
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:54,800
Good. And don't do it. Just calming.

448
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,690
Sometimes we bomb when we're
trying to work something out.

449
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,450
Like when you are working things out,
I'm sure you can. I'm sure you, you,

450
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,920
you just felt insulted by
what Mike Young was selling.

451
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,733
I know that feeling

452
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,820
miserable. You can, you can, you
know, guys can go down a bad road.

453
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,640
It's loud.

454
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,390
You can come do a Joe show tomorrow
if you want to do a five minute set of

455
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,190
reading your Twitter. Where do a
show tomorrow. Yeah. Um, before I,

456
00:27:33,191 --> 00:27:37,060
even this weekend is comedy
and Magic Club. Um, so, uh,

457
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,210
this a Friday and Saturday where the
comedy Magic Club in her most of the beach

458
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,860
and uh, tickets or there's, there's
still some left but not much.

459
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,940
And then next week,
Friday night we're going to a,

460
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:53,020
Gotham is beating me and the wild Jew
and a at Gotham at a nice feeling,

461
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,020
a flashlight, the alien.
And that's next, uh,

462
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,210
next Friday night and then Wednesday
tomorrow sounds, sounds comedy hall.

463
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,690
And how like Tom Segura,

464
00:28:04,691 --> 00:28:08,420
Christina and a lot of people
licensed Lessinger either to,

465
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,530
a lot of people are going,

466
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,430
it's going to be really fun and
that's a great place to fuck around.

467
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,520
I came up with two new jokes last time
I was there really just on stage. Yeah.

468
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,060
That's awesome.

469
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,820
Because it's such a little intimate
environment and everyone knows that.

470
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:20,380
It's like you're there for that,
you know,

471
00:28:20,381 --> 00:28:22,720
it's like everyone
knows that you're there.

472
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,590
I do my material but I'm really there
to do my, I want to entertain you,

473
00:28:26,591 --> 00:28:30,280
but I also want to like go down crazy
roads to see what happens completely free

474
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:33,070
ball.
And you can't do that in a big crowd.

475
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,010
You need to do that in like an 80
seat or in 90 seater, then you just,

476
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:38,170
you really know what's
funny and what's not.

477
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:42,340
You can't get off any tricks
and an intimate environment
are really small room.

478
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,840
You can't get off any tricks.

479
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,310
It's like it's either funny or it's
not and it's very truthful, you know?

480
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,030
And you could do that. I'm telling
you, you can do it. So when you're,

481
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,570
when you're talking about not
wanting all these other things,

482
00:28:55,571 --> 00:28:56,590
like not wanting to be,
to me,

483
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,740
you've already managed to avoid that
in the most demeaning job possible.

484
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:05,080
Yeah, seriously. I don't feel
like it's that demeaning.

485
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,570
I think that there could be
forced fuck anyone. Yeah.

486
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:10,550
Judges, judges, anybody,
the son hurting anybody.

487
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,670
If anybody just not hurting anybody,
whatever you're doing. Wow. How weird.

488
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:14,504
It may be.

489
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,330
What makes you happy?

490
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,860
I'm brainwashed or maybe I need
to be rescued or maybe I just,

491
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:23,890
I was raised in properly or you know,

492
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:26,590
or I'm still going to be heat then
or something that I'm just, you know,

493
00:29:26,591 --> 00:29:30,350
I need the right person to slap some
sense into me because big damage

494
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,840
for most people, that's the case
for most people in your business,

495
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:34,621
that's the case.
I mean,

496
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:39,450
it's not an irrational reason for them
to think that it doesn't account for all

497
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,030
variability. There's a, there's a
lot more variables, variabilities,

498
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,490
there's a lot more variables.
It doesn't count for all of them.

499
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,200
And there's people can be,
you know,

500
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:49,300
into all kinds of things
for no fucking reason.

501
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,570
And to say that it's all from
abuser. Yes. So you were happy,

502
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,610
you were happy growing up,
happy for her.

503
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:59,570
Yeah, very. You know,
mom, dad, brother, cats,

504
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,480
everybody

505
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,090
just really open about sex in your
house. Like how did you become? So,

506
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,630
uh, I don't know. I was like,

507
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,990
I'm weird and I've always been weird.

508
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Like I asked my mom what would I like
when I was a kid and she was like pretty

509
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:16,590
much exactly the same way as you are
now just shorter. And I was like okay.

510
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,780
Then like it was kind of neurotic,

511
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:23,781
silly person for a very long time and
I never had like any sex talks with my

512
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:27,240
parents.
I think at a certain point they were like,

513
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:30,840
it's really normal to experiment with
sex and drugs but you probably shouldn't

514
00:30:30,841 --> 00:30:32,760
drink. And I was like, well
I'm going to go get drunk.

515
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:35,130
Cause if my parents think
that drugs and sex are cool,

516
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,080
they must suck or be nerdy or whatever.
Like I they,

517
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,910
I kind of went Alex p Keaton on them.

518
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,330
Right.
Little little flip man.

519
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,820
That's something you got to really
be aware of when you're raising kids.

520
00:30:46,821 --> 00:30:48,590
You can't just tell them
what you want them to do,

521
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,990
right?
No you don't.

522
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,150
Yeah. You gotta kind of figure
out a way to trick them,

523
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,050
trick the little monsters
and yeah, that's right. Yeah.

524
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,170
So you just gravitated towards
the alcohol to be a rebel.

525
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,690
Yeah.
I was like,

526
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,510
have like a really bad drinker when I
was younger and I went through phases

527
00:31:05,511 --> 00:31:06,890
where I would not drink at all,

528
00:31:06,891 --> 00:31:11,450
but then like pick right up and like
be a drunk person until I was like 23.

529
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,280
Wow. Yeah. I was just like,
ah, I didn't and like sex. Oh,

530
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,210
I mean I wasn't like
super interested in it.

531
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Like I had boyfriends and stuff and like
my parents never tried to make me feel

532
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:25,970
bad about sex, but the men that
I was with always dead like

533
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,270
that made you feel bad about it.

534
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,680
About like having how many people I've
had sex with or like what I'm into or

535
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:37,040
whatever. And I would just like, I
always found it to be pretty strange.

536
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:40,030
So I guess like my parents
raised me to have good, um,

537
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:45,250
ideas about sexuality but really like
wasn't really pant like laid out for me in

538
00:31:47,451 --> 00:31:48,170
any way

539
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:48,981
for men.
You know,

540
00:31:48,981 --> 00:31:52,070
you want to know how many partners
because then the likelihood of her leaving

541
00:31:52,071 --> 00:31:54,290
you becomes assessed.
Like how long are you sure.

542
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,970
That is such a sensitive thing to say,

543
00:31:56,971 --> 00:31:59,760
which I think is really interesting
because I think that a lot of people would

544
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:01,010
say, you know, you know,

545
00:32:01,011 --> 00:32:06,011
and to see if she like a whore or slutty
or if she was like disease or whatever.

546
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:06,250
Okay.

547
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,630
She's gonna get me herpes. There's that
too. There's that. She's not special.

548
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:12,240
That's pretty, yeah. Pretty interesting.

549
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,870
Yeah. Well what the fuck is
your, your uh, a comp. You're,

550
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:19,600
you're an accumulation
of all your experiences,

551
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,810
sexual or wherever the fuck you
want it. I mean, maybe you may miss,

552
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,620
the only problem is it becomes like you
find out about like trains that were run

553
00:32:26,621 --> 00:32:30,940
on her and like how many times damn
bitch. Like how many gang bangs? Three.

554
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:33,640
Fuck, you know, and
then you start thinking,

555
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:38,170
how can I ever think that that's what
sex is special between us? You know,

556
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,960
how could I ever think that,
uh, that this is, uh, this is

557
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:46,150
real worthy of my love. Real Shit. Yeah.
It's not what I seen in the movies.

558
00:32:46,151 --> 00:32:48,400
You know, it's not what I see
in Sandra Bullock's movies.

559
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,230
Sandra Bullock never
gets a train run on her.

560
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,550
She doesn't go to work and get fucked.

561
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:56,560
Me asked me to come home and want to
cuddle with you so she could fucking do

562
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:57,640
whatever now.
No.

563
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,110
Yeah. Not for a woman. She
can go full on vanish. She's,

564
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,020
she's one of the verge of vanishing
already. She's 40 years old,

565
00:33:05,021 --> 00:33:07,510
43 years old or something like that.
She is very cute,

566
00:33:07,511 --> 00:33:09,280
but you're not going to want to see her.

567
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:13,210
And she's 60 in a romantic comedy about
alone trying to find her way and she

568
00:33:13,211 --> 00:33:16,060
coached a bunch of black guys that are
playing football and she learns. Yeah,

569
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,190
like in the blind side movie,
she was a little bit of a like a mom,

570
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:26,720
not like a girlfriend or sex a boss.

571
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,620
It's so funny how we identify with someone
who's going through some crazy stripe

572
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,160
on television. Crazy crap. She didn't
deserve that. She seems nice enough.

573
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,930
Yeah. But I do wonder why she was married
to that Jesse James and that seems

574
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:42,170
completely tattooed all over the planet.
What is that about?

575
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:44,320
I never really understood that.
Is that like a,

576
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,380
they both enjoy cocaine or
something or he's a charmer

577
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,170
charmer. There's some guys that
are charmers and I think, uh,

578
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,950
he was very obsessed with being famous.
Listen to me, I'm like, Okay Nancy Grace,

579
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,070
what do we have here is a charmer.

580
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,260
He is a bullshit artist and he's
getting this girl to believe him.

581
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,950
Now we have a dead baby in Florida,

582
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:13,260
which talks about this a dead baby in
Florida. Nancy grace is on that shit.

583
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,190
You'll look for this story on
cnn.com you will find nothing. Whoo.

584
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:22,340
Here we have the mother come home from
war boss cigarettes with the baby in the

585
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:27,960
car now. I love it. She
hates the Anthony so much.

586
00:34:27,961 --> 00:34:32,550
Casey Anthony killed her daughter. Kaylee.
And why was she seems cool, but no,

587
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:36,210
but like the thing is she's not like
ever trying to present herself as like an

588
00:34:36,211 --> 00:34:38,520
impartial news part.
Like and Casey Anthony,

589
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,710
they will figure out the truth about
you cause you murder your baby. Well,

590
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,500
he's like I said,
that's totally bias.

591
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,250
Well, she's not alive. She's not
supposed to be a news person.

592
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,460
She's like a discussion person.
No, but she's a former prosecutor.

593
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,840
I guess the interesting part of her case,
she's got to figure it out.

594
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,810
That's a crazy thing is like when she's,
when she's talking about tiger woods,

595
00:35:00,811 --> 00:35:03,360
like, whoa, Whoa, Whoa,
settle the fuck down. Hooker.

596
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,730
I thought you were all about
dead babies in Florida.

597
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,090
What are you doing about black athletes
that like the fuck like really?

598
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,610
You're gonna,

599
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:13,380
you're gonna spend three weeks working
on black athletes that want to fuck.

600
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,210
Like really? That's all.
Who are these girls?

601
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,340
Where do they come from?
How did they get his phone number?

602
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,540
Well, Nancy grace. Grace
with love. So black cock.

603
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,350
If anybody could use some black caucus,
Nancy grace, I could see her enjoying it.

604
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,960
[inaudible] I paid for that.
I could see her enjoying it.

605
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,730
I can see her getting stuffed.

606
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,920
Somebody who just finally fucking treating
her like she's really sexual and hot

607
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,720
for the like the first time at
2030 years. Oh, she'd get into it.

608
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,420
Big Man.
Dango Ebony sward

609
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:53,530
that's the word. Yes and no sound.
Annunciated the w s ward. Oh,

610
00:35:53,531 --> 00:35:57,860
here's a dead man.
[inaudible]. See that's fun

611
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,790
colony right there. That's timing. You
could totally be standup comedian there.

612
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:04,080
You're good.
You could totally do it.

613
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:08,550
I'm telling you the same real comics
and comics and porn stars are very,

614
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:09,384
very similar.

615
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,980
We all come from some fucking weird our
ways where we didn't get what we were

616
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:17,850
supposed to get where a young and there's
a hole and you know you fill that hole

617
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:19,350
up however you want with jokes.

618
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,220
It's the same thing. There's
room for both. My whole, yeah,

619
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,300
I'm telling you could do it.
You could fit hands in there and shit.

620
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,480
People didn't clap. You got five
minutes tomorrow at Sal's comedy hosts.

621
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,353
Oh my God.

622
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,170
You don't have to do it. No
pressure. You don't want to fuck.

623
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:39,500
Look what happened with her with drinking.
Do that dude.

624
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,500
You can't push her in a direction.
She's going to push back.

625
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,950
We're going to take your bullshit.

626
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:48,260
So he says, yeah man, he's just
fucking trying to trick you.

627
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,350
I saw the funniest photo of
you. She has, by the way,

628
00:36:50,351 --> 00:36:55,330
she has a accessing with trainees
like she like is addicted to trainees.

629
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,710
I sold one of his big black tie,
seven to like seven to seven,

630
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,950
four or something.
He was giant.

631
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,910
I look at you say she was
that kind of huge girl.

632
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,050
She said funny. How was it? She
was that even a turn on that?

633
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,200
I just thought that she was
like really owning her shit.

634
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:18,640
She just like work in the room like it
must be fucking like I'm five eight and I

635
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:21,380
feel like I'm a little bit too tall
and you know, under five, eight. Yeah.

636
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:26,310
I kind of like a trainee. Like sometimes
I'm in touch with my inner training,

637
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,390
inner training, my masculine
side, my masculine feminine side.

638
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:36,440
They've a your boner.
It's a fem bone on bone or Lesbos.

639
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,940
It depends what it's for.
Yeah, I dunno. What does that

640
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:42,340
look?

641
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,760
Are you guys talking about why but is a
terrible time to get your balls caught

642
00:37:45,761 --> 00:37:47,230
and your pants and you have to adjust?

643
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,110
This conversation is going on my like
the last thing allows anybody to think

644
00:37:50,111 --> 00:37:55,020
that I'm getting a hard right
now, but I'm shifting my balls,

645
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,550
pant,

646
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,270
Federer moment or I'll put a black bar
over there talking about like femme boner

647
00:37:59,271 --> 00:38:03,460
or something and I'm like, God damn it.
I didn't have to adjust my boss. Uh,

648
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,210
looking terrible timing.
I'm very obsessed with Rupaul's drag race.

649
00:38:07,211 --> 00:38:10,570
I've been watching it for all three
seasons and I really like the drag drag

650
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:10,811
queens.

651
00:38:10,811 --> 00:38:13,550
They used to hang out with drag queens
a lot when I lived in group session.

652
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:18,580
Just you find it cool or interesting when
people are just really being themself,

653
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,910
right? Even if it means like dressing
as a different gender or whatever,

654
00:38:21,911 --> 00:38:24,140
it's just because that's
like what they feel. Right.

655
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,660
It's very ambiguous and I really
like that. Why not, right? Yeah.

656
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:32,260
Why the fuck not like I used to go out
and like pulling drag looks with drag

657
00:38:32,261 --> 00:38:36,100
Queens in Florida and P and I
like blended with them because

658
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,990
they thought you were a big woman,

659
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,610
a dude dressed as well just
as a dude dressed as a girl,

660
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:48,340
some pretty next level inception type
of shit. It was the next level shit.

661
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,300
Yeah, your hands are too
small or too small. No Dude,

662
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:56,200
you were really one of those people
that were supposed to be born a woman,

663
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,960
you know? Wow. That would be the worst.

664
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,350
So it's way better to be a woman
who looks like might be a tranny.

665
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,210
Then a dude who looks like a woman

666
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,210
that are like the like girl,
like a gin.

667
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,980
They're like jeans are just messed up
and they just ended up with a deck but

668
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:15,580
they're like really more woman.
They have like a whole different,

669
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,860
like if they want to do trainee porn,
they,

670
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:21,690
it's a very niche and that they look more
like women than like someone that may

671
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:26,630
be started transitioning later in life
and it was more masculine and so it opens

672
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:31,150
their door to like be like the best
transsexual prostitute or a porn star or

673
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:35,490
whatever. Like they could really like
cash in on that. You know, people you

674
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:40,280
really want to do to make their sex,
like an issue going to be the best

675
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,530
possible to compete. And
who's the best training? Yeah,

676
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:47,480
they've like training yours.
Bailey Bailey.

677
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:51,410
Jay got the best transsexual
performer followed the trainees,

678
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,610
trainees follow me and
I followed them back.

679
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:59,420
And I think they're just hot girls.

680
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,730
They're probably just happy that
someone accepts them. You know?

681
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,350
I figured anybody except the Joe Rogan.
Exactly.

682
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,350
I think there's a broad
spectrum of human behavior.

683
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,900
There's a huge spectrum
and all I care about

684
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:19,180
that fighting stuff or like fucking stuff
and we're teaching people real values.

685
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:25,400
Well, I mean that's what this, this thing
is about. This is just a conversation.

686
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,800
Yes. You know, we, we, we, it's
so easy to judge people valuable.

687
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:30,983
What's the good

688
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:35,690
confused and we would naturally
gravitate towards teams.

689
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,180
And if you're not on
team dress like a guy,

690
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,700
all of a sudden there's
something fucked up about you.

691
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,910
But if you're a fucking guy who
really loves dressing like a chick,

692
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,330
who the fucking mind, who's anybody to
say there's something wrong with them?

693
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:48,691
Why not?

694
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:52,130
80 girls dress like guys all the time
and you never have a problem with it.

695
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,690
I mean,
I don't want to dress like a woman,

696
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:58,870
but I don't give a shit if you do
really strikes hot Hilary swank,

697
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:05,030
Hilary swank, and I think she's
hot. I think Hillary's is, I got,

698
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,390
if I've heard dude say that they think
she looks like a man, I'm like, I dunno.

699
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,240
Maybe you need to get a
certain amount of man in you.

700
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:14,780
You mean to be a certain amount
of masculine to appreciate
a beauty like Hillary

701
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,820
swearing,
which is a little on the manly side.

702
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,810
You need to be more dominant,
more masculine than her. Yeah.

703
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,500
You don't want to be like a frail
man and you want to Fuck Hillary.

704
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:26,700
Swank shall mount you
and ground and pound you.

705
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,280
I am actually probably more
masculine than Hillary Swank.

706
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,100
The person I would have to the
two of you together because

707
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,180
when you see someone in real life,

708
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:36,830
like people always telling me
when they meet me, God damn,

709
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:39,750
you're so fucking short. I never
thought you showing. No, it's true.

710
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,280
Five eight but on TV, yeah, but
on TV, you know, you look big,

711
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,150
you know you're on television.

712
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:47,580
Then these people meet me and they're
like towering over me and they're like,

713
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:49,470
well, you know, like you meet a guy,
he's like six four and like, oh,

714
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:50,640
I thought you were fucking taller.

715
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,660
Like you don't know what anybody's like
until you actually meet them. I mean,

716
00:41:54,661 --> 00:41:55,021
you'd have to,

717
00:41:55,021 --> 00:41:58,140
you'd have to like see like I've met
celebrities that I thought were like these

718
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:01,850
big people and there's these little
tiny people and look at Conan O'brien.

719
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,980
I never knew he was that
tall. Very tall, very tall.

720
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,250
Which I'm sure it makes it awkward when
he does his show because he's a tower is

721
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:11,870
over all these people and he wants to be
unassuming and you know, you know it's,

722
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,690
it's, it's, it's interesting thing. So
who's more manly? You are Hillary Swank.

723
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,980
She would have to be
sitting right next to you.

724
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,890
Cause when she did million dollar
baby and she played the boxer,

725
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,760
she's like pretty fucking manly. All
right. She was, but she was yoked.

726
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,180
Do you remember that? I couldn't work
out if I didn't love not working out,

727
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,970
but she already knew she already did it.

728
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:32,460
So I'm pretty sure she's more
masculine than, you know, look,

729
00:42:32,461 --> 00:42:36,090
if you were together right next to each
other and shape doesn't mean they're

730
00:42:36,091 --> 00:42:38,820
like masculine the fuck
it doesn't. Yeah, it does.

731
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,350
It's all directly related to how
difficult it would be to rape you. Yeah,

732
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,170
exactly.

733
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,800
That's what it is. You look like
you'd be a tangle, like kind of. Damn.

734
00:42:46,801 --> 00:42:49,950
I couldn't even get hard to fight,
fight for my life here.

735
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,160
If a man feels like you could
just absolutely run away with you,

736
00:42:53,161 --> 00:42:54,040
like grab you and

737
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,550
tortured people on their balls.

738
00:42:56,551 --> 00:42:59,820
I don't think I would have
any like problem like trying
to like punch someone in

739
00:42:59,821 --> 00:43:03,290
the face or rip their eyes out or
kick them in the deck or something. I,

740
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,930
I've been like very aggressively
sexual towards men and shame them.

741
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,500
So I feel like that would be an
advantage of our rapists rapists out.

742
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,470
Nobody tried to rape me cause
I can kick your Dick and balls.

743
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,710
All I'm saying, why are you
trying to get people to rape me?

744
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,300
You know your followership

745
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:27,120
don't Rape Dana please.
And if you're thinking about it,

746
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,710
please stop thinking about it.

747
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:34,560
What I'm saying is that's when a woman
becomes a manly looking when she looks

748
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:38,350
how diff. Very rude. Very right. It's so,

749
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,730
it's so inconsiderate. I wanna fuck
you. Even if you don't want it.

750
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,150
This girl I was talking to
the other day on a, she sits,

751
00:43:45,151 --> 00:43:48,160
she was raped twice and I'm like,
I'm like,

752
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,690
which one was the better
one to break that down,

753
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:57,930
write that down. That's a bit like if
you had to choose one, which one was,

754
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,970
you've got to do that tomorrow
night at south 100%. That is a bit,

755
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,770
no doubt about it.
That's really funny.

756
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:07,710
I think it's really funny. The bts of
porn movies, they'll try to be like,

757
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:10,020
when did you lose your virginity?
And some people just full on.

758
00:44:10,021 --> 00:44:10,854
I was like how old were you?

759
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,720
Yeah, the behind the scenes. Oh

760
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,490
that's one for our size.

761
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,830
I thought you were sitting like a
message board, like a bbs bulletin board.

762
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:28,020
Like the little behind the scenes
but it's just people are like,

763
00:44:28,021 --> 00:44:29,300
how old were you?

764
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,050
They show you guys like
Duchenne and cleaning up.

765
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:36,400
I always try to trick people into like
watching me p and Douche and stuff cause

766
00:44:36,401 --> 00:44:41,050
they're not really supposed to film like
peeing because like the distributors

767
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:45,190
have like a problem with it.
Well my bloody getting on people.

768
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:50,590
Some places I've seen, but um, I did
a movie called girls lie for vivid,

769
00:44:50,591 --> 00:44:54,730
all directed by you MCI and it had a
girl taking a pregnancy test and she peed

770
00:44:54,731 --> 00:44:58,240
on it on the toilet and they can show
it because it's like in a medical

771
00:44:58,241 --> 00:45:01,990
environment. Yeah, like a normal
environment. Like pp goes in the toilet,

772
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,860
not in Dana's mouth.
I saw that's what you think.

773
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:08,770
I saw a guy pissed in someone's
mouth live. It was really funny.

774
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:12,610
I think it's funny, I think it's more
hilarious than anything that, you know,

775
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,600
somebody like they want to jack off to
the movies and I want to see naked people

776
00:45:16,601 --> 00:45:19,780
and they want to see some weird shit.
But then also kind of like when a laugh,

777
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,113
I think

778
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:27,520
it was a, there's a guy that used to do
it called extreme Elvis and he, I met him,

779
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,330
I met him.
Yeah.

780
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,430
He's buddies with Doug Stan home and Doug
was opening up for him at this bar and

781
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,680
the guy goes up there, he's fat as
fuck. And he's a really good singer.

782
00:45:35,681 --> 00:45:38,320
Like he's really good and
the band is tight, you know,

783
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:42,790
it's not just a bizarro show. And then
the guy takes his clothes off and he goes,

784
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,300
Michael Salus,
I'm a complete micro Phallus.

785
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:49,180
I mean it's like to the point where
people are laughing hysterical.

786
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:50,740
I believe it's still up on my website.

787
00:45:50,741 --> 00:45:55,450
I believe I took a picture of his dick
and he's pissing in this woman's mouth.

788
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,750
He goes, who else drives gangs?
Purse, let's go. Goes. I do. I do.

789
00:45:58,751 --> 00:46:00,820
And she gets her knee and I took
pictures of the whole thing.

790
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,420
I told you I took pictures of them
pissing in her mouth, pissing in a glass.

791
00:46:04,421 --> 00:46:07,450
She drinks the glass
like is fucking crazy.

792
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,800
He comes off stage and he's in the crowd
and some woman tries to stick a beer

793
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:14,890
bottle up his ass. You
can like pee on cue. Yeah.

794
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,530
Some woman tries to stick a beer
bottle up his ass and he goes,

795
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,600
that's the wrong holes right here.
Get it right here.

796
00:46:19,601 --> 00:46:23,710
Like he helps her stuffed as beer bottle
up his ass and she panics and just

797
00:46:23,711 --> 00:46:25,780
drops the bottle.
Or she panicked,

798
00:46:25,781 --> 00:46:28,720
like she thought she would stick her beer
bottle up this guy's ass and he would

799
00:46:28,721 --> 00:46:30,760
freak out like, Hey, what
the fuck? Right. But he goes,

800
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:32,770
you can get in the wrong hole, honey.
It's right here. I'll guide you in there.

801
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,760
And he starts helping her. I stick a
fucking beer bottle up his asshole.

802
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:39,700
But that sounds like this
guy's real ready to go. Yeah.

803
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,560
So I run into him and I think that's
art. I run into him, Paul Provenza show,

804
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,490
ah, I run into him at the Paul Provenza
show and now he's no longer extreme albus

805
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:50,170
and I think he's like clean and sober now.

806
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:54,400
He used to get hammered as fuck
before he did that show. And you know,

807
00:46:54,401 --> 00:46:56,740
I was talking to him,
I've met him before a while ago,

808
00:46:56,741 --> 00:46:58,270
like at the bright spot or something.

809
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:02,530
And I was talking out in the proper vendor
show about a guy that I used to know

810
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:06,880
who was a male feminist. That's how he
would describe himself as a male feminist.

811
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:10,570
And it was just, it was just as
like really sad, weak guy. And

812
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:12,521
yeah,

813
00:47:12,521 --> 00:47:16,870
it was very savvy and he was this guy
like this really like a bag of Jello as a

814
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:20,590
human being. He was just like, and
eventually she left him and so anyway,

815
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:24,190
I was mocking this whole idea of like,
how the fuck could you be a male feminist?

816
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:28,990
And after I get off stage, he goes, well,
I'm a male feminist. And I'm like, oh wow.

817
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,100
I would love to debate you on that.

818
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,070
Like we should do some TV.
I'm like, you just said it.

819
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,630
You just said exactly what
I said. Like, uh, the,

820
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:40,650
a fleshy ball of Jello with a micro
Fallis and you're a male feminist.

821
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:45,640
Well of course you are. You have to
lady. Well basically, no, no offense,

822
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,040
you're,

823
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,600
you're a bad motherfucker and what you
do when you do that crazy Elvis thing.

824
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,670
But like, you know, talking
about being a feminist,

825
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:53,020
like be whatever the fuck you want to be,

826
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,540
but you can't tell me it's not
ridiculous. You're, you're,

827
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:58,500
you're like really into the female
of the species. Like you're,

828
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,250
you're really like thinking of them first.
Like,

829
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:02,740
what the fuck are you talking about?
How about being a God damn human.

830
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,520
I'm going to be in a human across the
board sexually, whether it's male, female,

831
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:09,970
gay, straight trans, who gives a shit?
How about being across the board?

832
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:13,550
Not a fucking feminist. You
dumb ass. You can't defend that,

833
00:48:13,551 --> 00:48:14,730
but you only want to help

834
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:19,610
women. You only want to promote women.
You fucking weak, bitch. That's weak shit.

835
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,510
I don't even call myself a feminist. I
wouldn't say. I would say like, I'm not,

836
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,980
not a feminist. Things I can
get on board with and whatever.

837
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:28,911
But you know,

838
00:48:28,911 --> 00:48:31,880
there's so many different
waves of feminism that people
will come behind you and

839
00:48:31,881 --> 00:48:32,750
just be like,
Eh,

840
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,720
is this grouping everything together?
Stupid at the beginning? Yes.

841
00:48:35,721 --> 00:48:38,230
All groups are stupid,
you know, all of it. Yeah.

842
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,400
Were you looking out for what I mean,
you can't fucking fix the world. I mean,

843
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:45,080
there's some things that you have to have.
Like you have to have some sort of a,

844
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,160
uh, an a group that's there to investigate
claims of racism when it comes to jobs

845
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:53,660
and stuff like that. I mean you have
to have some groups, but as possible.

846
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:58,160
That's good. Sure. Dominated
as little as possible,

847
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:02,240
as little goddamn groups as possible.
Yeah. That's the key. You know,

848
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:06,290
people get on fucking team mentality
mode and they start just going after it

849
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:11,140
almost team Stroup. Oh, more tune queer,
you know, Oh, I'm on this, I'm on that.

850
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:12,670
They can't help it.
I like it.

851
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,600
I like it all just everybody's got
to lighten the fuck up, Right Dana?

852
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,120
Yes.
Isn't that the key to this world?

853
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:24,890
He does say that we'd cook could
fix the world probably for real.

854
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,360
It sounds silly.

855
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:30,830
It sounds silly coming from a fucking
comedian and a porn star and a a video

856
00:49:30,831 --> 00:49:32,330
comedian.
Real

857
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:36,550
obviously. Yeah. Maybe people listen to
us because maybe we were a little bit more

858
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,310
formed.

859
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:40,520
I read this post on a message board the
other day about this dude who talked

860
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:44,210
about he had smoked pot for the first
time in like seven years and he was

861
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,610
absolutely terrified to his core.

862
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,390
And then it brought up all these crazy
thoughts of childhood and he could not

863
00:49:50,391 --> 00:49:54,920
handle it and it would open
up this fascinating discussion
because um, you know,

864
00:49:54,921 --> 00:49:57,110
some people were saying that's
normal. Some people were saying, well,

865
00:49:57,111 --> 00:49:57,681
you got some shit.

866
00:49:57,681 --> 00:50:00,050
You got to deal with his fucking with
you in the back of your head and you're,

867
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,000
and you're sober life.
You're not addressing it.

868
00:50:02,001 --> 00:50:05,210
But that's why we eat is good for you.

869
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,050
You're supposed to look at everything
all the time. And a lot of us don't.

870
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:12,510
We like to burry shit in the back of our
hand and try not to address whatever's

871
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:15,650
fucking with us.
And we just turned a light on that shit.

872
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:18,800
Whenever you have in your life that's
fucking with you that you're trying to put

873
00:50:18,801 --> 00:50:23,330
deep in your subconscious, marijuana
does not allow that. It doesn't allow it.

874
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:26,930
So people say, Oh, it makes me paranoid.
Not Know. It's making you think about the,

875
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,130
you need to be thinking

876
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,230
about,
you should be fucking paranoid.

877
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,800
You should be aware of how vulnerable
you are. The world is very fucked up.

878
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,260
I had to like move because people were
stealing my mail when I live in silver.

879
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:41,730
Like I had to like move to a high
security building. I couldn't feel,

880
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,350
I knew where you were. Yeah.
Fans like that's, and I was like,

881
00:50:45,351 --> 00:50:48,110
I did think I was paranoid, but I was
like, no, these people are for real,

882
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,000
like know who I am.
And it's kind of trippy.

883
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:54,380
Did you have a happy child on you
think? Oh yeah, absolutely. Really?

884
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:59,360
I um, my parents were involved in
everything. A PTA girl scouting.

885
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:04,040
I was a figure skater or they
say finger skating. How does,

886
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,930
how do your parents deal
with what you do now? Um,

887
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:12,860
I don't know. I don't know if
they deal with it. I Dunno.

888
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:17,390
It's not really something
that is a non issue. An issue.

889
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:21,380
Yeah. Really. They're like no
big deal. You're just, yeah.
Having sex on film. Yeah.

890
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:24,710
Wow. That's fascinating. Pretty much.
Well, they also see that, yeah, you know,

891
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,040
I have a reasonable, uh, you know,

892
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:32,170
amount of following and fan base and
people who appreciate what I contribute to

893
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:35,170
the porn industry besides just being like,

894
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:40,260
just you personally more holes in a
bunch of fake hair. It's, you know,

895
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:44,890
just uh, so you contribute being
your personality and your assumption.

896
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,590
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Um, but my,

897
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:51,530
my parent's respect my decisions,

898
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,160
which was maybe kind of a very foreign
concept for most people because the

899
00:51:55,170 --> 00:52:00,170
people, people's parents tend to,
you know, tell them what to do.

900
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:04,430
And My, my parents are opposite. They told
me like, were they religious at all? No,

901
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:10,110
my parents are religious. What
is their background? Oh Man,

902
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:10,500
my,

903
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,320
my grandmother is from Germany and I
don't think that my mom was raised with a

904
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:17,680
religion because my grandmother was
like a new agey dad do for a living,

905
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:21,850
whatever.
My Dad does a kind of weird shit like I,

906
00:52:21,851 --> 00:52:24,380
he works with at a catering company now.
Um,

907
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:29,520
but he was like an onsite security manager
of a storage facility and he used to

908
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:31,810
be a CEO of a software company.

909
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:36,730
And he quit that to be a fish farmer and
then he like went to like ranch cattle

910
00:52:36,731 --> 00:52:39,980
and Oklahoma. Like my dad is just
kind of all over the place. Wow.

911
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:44,530
That's Kinda cool though. My Dad is like
kind of like a genius at free spirit.

912
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,430
All, all sorts of things.
But like for that amount of
time, you know, he just like,

913
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:51,320
yeah,
he's like turbo thruster,

914
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:55,510
like short change careers and your life.

915
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,960
My Dad does all the time
and my, my mom works, um,

916
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:04,220
at a company that makes stuff to
blow up Brown people in Florida.

917
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:10,040
Wow. Wait a missile company like
some, yeah, some form of arms.

918
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:13,310
Yeah. It doesn't have to be Brown. We met
Jackson, yellow people in North Korea.

919
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:18,410
Sure. Keep talking shit talking
shit. But motherfuckers,

920
00:53:18,411 --> 00:53:20,120
we got some shit for you.
Hey,

921
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:23,090
my mom has been like in her
job for a really long time.

922
00:53:23,091 --> 00:53:25,450
A bunch of people got mad at me,
people

923
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:30,570
MMA forum because I, uh, there was a,
we were in Kentucky and there was a,

924
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,790
some fights going on and
this kid who was a wrestler,

925
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:37,530
a was fighting this other guy who's a
kickboxer from Italy, right? And uh,

926
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:42,300
he lives in America, but
they were chanting, she will
suit you. And I was like,

927
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:45,930
really? Kentucky? And I'm like,
that guy lives in Miami. All right,

928
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,830
we're all immigrants.
All right?

929
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:52,080
Everyone in this fucking country descended
from immigrants and no one was here

930
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,720
10,000 years ago. It was all
ice. You Fuck, all right,

931
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,310
that's the whole deal with America.

932
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,030
This guy actually lives here and
you're yelling USA. And you know,

933
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,510
people were like saying like,
you know,

934
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:03,810
there's nothing wrong with patriotism
and you're in forcing your beliefs on

935
00:54:03,811 --> 00:54:07,050
other people. I'm like, no, I'm, I'm
making fun of Shit. I think it's stupid.

936
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:11,520
You know, you're being colored
commentary silly. You're yelling at USA.

937
00:54:11,521 --> 00:54:15,780
What did just watch these guys for their
goddamn technique and their courage and

938
00:54:15,781 --> 00:54:17,280
what the fuck they're
trying to accomplish.

939
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:20,220
And the difficulty of the task
is a great God damn fight,

940
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,230
which again is all American wrestler who
beat Phil Davis and Ryan Bader is bad

941
00:54:24,231 --> 00:54:27,150
ass fucking wrestler and this Italian
kickboxer he's trying to get his ground

942
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:30,060
game together. It's a great
fucking fight. And he's dildos you,

943
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:34,080
you if they spit all over the back of
the person's head in front of them.

944
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:38,220
This dumb fucking mouth breathing cock
suckers how a cell and they get mad at

945
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:39,330
you for being upset at it.

946
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,570
How else did you feel about that your
your time over in Kentucky? Because I,

947
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:47,571
I grew up around there and I going
through Kentucky was always a fun time.

948
00:54:47,581 --> 00:54:50,730
It always is great dude.
Louisville's a great city.

949
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:54,600
The comedy club was fucking fantastic.
The people there are super cool.

950
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,310
The people that worked there
were super cool. It's like,

951
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:01,460
it's got this weird southern sort of
like almost hippie thing going on.

952
00:55:01,621 --> 00:55:03,960
There's like a lot of
like young people there.

953
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,810
There's a lot of like open minded people
there and then there's a lot of old

954
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:08,770
money and then there's a lot of ghetto.
Yeah.

955
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:13,440
So it's this weird combination of shit
scar. No, not Alexi. Not In Louisville.

956
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,390
Louisville is the old money.
It's like,

957
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,210
it's a rare part of the
south where it's like,

958
00:55:18,211 --> 00:55:23,211
there's a lot of like really establish
like social clans and groups and social

959
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:27,720
lives. A lot of money, like really,
really old money down there.

960
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,390
But a lot of educated people too.
But they're on that show.

961
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:32,070
The first 48 they're on
that show all the time.

962
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:34,350
It was getting jacked in Louisville.

963
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:39,900
I got a Uverse are real dead bodies.

964
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:44,130
That's so creepy. It's dark. It's really
weird that you can show, um, you know,

965
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:48,510
anybody getting shot in a movie, but you
can't show people really fucking, yeah.

966
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:49,240
So amazing.

967
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,900
Or like a, a woman experiencing
sexual pleasure. It's like, okay,

968
00:55:52,901 --> 00:55:53,900
if it's like the dude,
go ahead.

969
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:57,340
But like not fan of a guy just
down the girl having an orgasm.

970
00:55:57,341 --> 00:55:59,290
It's very not done.

971
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,850
Yeah. Right. Does it ever
happen? Yeah. He never,

972
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,300
you never said like the girl coming.
So even if it's the guy,

973
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,800
and it's usually like for Congress,

974
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,960
private parts and the girls,
like on the speaker. Um,

975
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,840
like having an orgasm. Right. Howard
was making the noises and stuff.

976
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:20,520
I remember that was so shocking when
that came out. Like that was so, yeah.

977
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:21,383
When that movie,

978
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,130
fuck yeah, that was hot.
You're sitting on the speaker

979
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,620
and he's going to
microphone. Yeah, that was,

980
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:29,573
that was cool.

981
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,400
That's interesting that it's not thought
of as being very important if you come

982
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:37,030
because it's all leftover barbarian shit
and we used to hold you down by your

983
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:40,240
hair and just shoot a load and you
and run away. That's what it is.

984
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:45,130
That's how people made babies back
then. Let's grow. It is gross,

985
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,920
but it's the reason why men are stronger
than women. Why aren't you strong too?

986
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,010
You're not strong too, so we can rape
you easier. It's really that simple.

987
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:55,780
There's no logical reason why you
wouldn't be like [inaudible] tall. We're,

988
00:56:55,781 --> 00:56:59,800
we're stronger to fight off other men
that want to fuck you and kill the babies.

989
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,470
That's what we're strong.
That's totally right.

990
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,520
Strong to rape you and
to fight off other men.

991
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,870
It says you're supposed to be strong too.
Why aren't you strong too?

992
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:11,000
Sky Is wrestle each other so they get
off out of their system instead of trying

993
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:11,870
to rape me.

994
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,460
[inaudible] haven't even considered Yo to,

995
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:17,710
haven't even looked into this so deeply.

996
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:21,120
They're scared because of
social constructs. Right.

997
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,700
We had a Ras,
if you're on his own podcast,

998
00:57:23,701 --> 00:57:28,680
had a gas that was addicted to going to
bath houses or, I mean massage parlors.

999
00:57:28,681 --> 00:57:31,760
Yup. To get late. Did you see, did he say
his name? No, no, no. All right. Okay.

1000
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,060
Do you have a mom with a mask on him
yet? A Spiderman mask on. Oh yeah, dude.

1001
00:57:36,061 --> 00:57:37,490
I almost said his name. Yeah, I know.

1002
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:41,990
Yes. But anyways, that was
close. Sorry. This is live.

1003
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:45,730
Maybe we should consider not having this
line. Even Charlie Sheen edits to shit.

1004
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:49,280
Uh, but so anyways, he, I never
knew. Like I always heard the,

1005
00:57:49,281 --> 00:57:51,350
the hand job thing where
they say they say handhelds,

1006
00:57:51,351 --> 00:57:53,540
but he was talking about how
there's places here in la,

1007
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:58,380
many places that he can get just like
fucking full on hooker sex. What?

1008
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,730
And he says that he's gotten to the point
where he has places that has favorite

1009
00:58:01,731 --> 00:58:03,350
places with his favorite. He's like, yeah,

1010
00:58:03,351 --> 00:58:08,280
this isn't like an la 10 at this one
place and it's $150 and you just fucking

1011
00:58:08,281 --> 00:58:12,440
there sit there and fuck after you do
a 15 minute massage. Whoa. And he says,

1012
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,070
he says and yeah,

1013
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,810
even bring out the women so they can
look like the bunny ranch where they,

1014
00:58:15,811 --> 00:58:18,920
they all call her and say hi and
stuff like that. Wow. Massage Parlor.

1015
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:23,470
Is there a thing where you
can get a massage part of
your sex massage at the end?

1016
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:27,440
Yeah,
like more relaxing the wind down.

1017
00:58:27,441 --> 00:58:30,410
They give you a legit and massage and
then they jerked you off at the end.

1018
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,690
The massage at the end though, I'm
crazy thing. Is that sterling? Yeah.

1019
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:38,450
Fast out the gate and then I would get
like the wine down. Oh, I see. Yeah.

1020
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:42,360
So you would go, wow, that's interesting
for a guy. I think it's the opposite,

1021
00:58:42,361 --> 00:58:46,390
right? Give me a massage first and
then beat me off. Don't be, yeah. Yeah,

1022
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,820
cause actually beat me off. I just want
to go away. Yeah, I'm done. See Ya.

1023
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:53,160
And I don't mean to massage. That's good.
I feel good. I'm loose. He also got,

1024
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:56,460
when men have an orgasm,

1025
00:58:56,461 --> 00:59:01,110
there's a fucking instinctive need
that you have to overcome to just run,

1026
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:06,900
to come get away. It's true in real
life, fucked the movies and real life.

1027
00:59:06,901 --> 00:59:10,440
When a guy comes, I'm telling you he wants
to run away. I mean you want to stay.

1028
00:59:10,441 --> 00:59:12,660
If you will love your wife
or your girlfriend and you,

1029
00:59:12,661 --> 00:59:15,090
you know you have this relationship
together. But if you don't,

1030
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,440
if you don't know each other that well,

1031
00:59:16,441 --> 00:59:21,120
then all sudden you fucking like get me
Outta here. What have I done? The snuggle.

1032
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,490
Snuggle.
Sometimes,

1033
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:26,090
sometimes if you really love the job, but
there's a lot of times when you're not,

1034
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:29,060
there's a lot of times
when you just want a raw,

1035
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:31,820
especially if you're drinking,

1036
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,770
if you're drinking and you
know that somehow or another,

1037
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:37,580
you've loud the alcohol and your penis
to talk you into some unreasonable

1038
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:38,414
situation.

1039
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:42,830
And then as soon as you orgasm that it
just becomes clear what the fuck happened.

1040
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:45,830
And then you want to run away,
get me Outta here.

1041
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,760
So what I'm trying to say
is it's way better to get

1042
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:53,170
massage first. He loosens you up then
drug. I'd be like, good, we're done.

1043
00:59:53,171 --> 00:59:54,910
We're done here. We're done. Thank you.

1044
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,110
You also said that how he got an escort
once and it was in this weird like small

1045
00:59:59,111 --> 01:00:02,170
town. It was like three o'clock
in the morning and uh, he, he,

1046
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,810
he only had two options and like on
the Internet you've found like their

1047
01:00:04,811 --> 01:00:07,390
websites and one the lady was
already out doing something else,

1048
01:00:07,391 --> 01:00:08,224
but the other one,

1049
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:12,490
you know like would show her eyes only
and then it will like show like her leg

1050
01:00:12,491 --> 01:00:15,070
or something like that cause it couldn't
show the whole thing. And so he's like,

1051
01:00:15,071 --> 01:00:17,560
fuck it, I am, I do this. And she
had a really nice or you know,

1052
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:21,340
it seemed really nice on
the phone or stuff. Then she
comes over and it was like,

1053
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:25,030
she, she was just like, had
to like stab wounds. She like,

1054
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:28,750
her teeth were all fucked up and her
voice sound like PJ Stansberry was like,

1055
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:31,120
hey,
come over here and stuff like that.

1056
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,140
And he said it was so bad
that like he felt like he,

1057
01:00:35,141 --> 01:00:38,140
it was impossible to fuck this
girl. So then he's goes, uh, yeah,

1058
01:00:38,141 --> 01:00:41,110
I have this thing and I like to do,
it's where you give me a blowjob,

1059
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:45,700
I put a blanket over you, why watch
porn? And she's like, alright, you know,

1060
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,760
and then afterwards she's like,
do you mind if I finish myself up?

1061
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:52,590
But you got me all hot and bothered and
says he just puts one leg up over on and

1062
01:00:52,591 --> 01:00:54,430
it just starts fucking masturbating.

1063
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,030
It's called skeptic tank to a rx.
If you're a skeptic, take to a desk,

1064
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:02,650
squad podcasts. But listen
to that, that's so sad.

1065
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:07,590
Friend that has been addicted to go into
those massage Polish forever and he's

1066
01:01:07,591 --> 01:01:09,930
never had a girlfriend as
long as I've known him.

1067
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:14,670
I've known him for more than 10 years and
more than 10 years that I've known him

1068
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:18,260
all, all this guy does is he's a, he's
not a very good looking guy. And he's,

1069
01:01:18,261 --> 01:01:22,440
he's not built very well and he went
bald really young in life and he's never

1070
01:01:22,441 --> 01:01:24,840
been successful. Right. And
just has a real hard time.

1071
01:01:24,841 --> 01:01:28,580
He gets real nervous around checks. So he
just goes, he's Asian massage place is,

1072
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:31,880
it just gets whacked off all the time.
Yeah. So a good percentage of like,

1073
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,000
it doesn't make a lot of money.

1074
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:35,970
So the good percentage of what this guy
makes every week goes to just getting

1075
01:01:35,971 --> 01:01:38,970
whacked off. And then he takes
them out on dates sometimes.

1076
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:42,060
He was talking to me about it once we
were playing pool and he was talking to me

1077
01:01:42,061 --> 01:01:43,810
about it. He's like, yeah, well, you know,

1078
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:48,840
I'm taking her on a date this Friday
though. What you get. Oh, okay. All right.

1079
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:51,870
So like judge up Joe, I'm, no,
no. I'm saying, do you think,

1080
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,520
is she going to be your boyfriend? Are you
going to be her boyfriend? Like what's,

1081
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,740
what's going on? Like you guys get, yeah.

1082
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:58,970
Um, romantic comedy, right.

1083
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:02,040
Wax Off dudes all day and then Thompson.

1084
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:07,330
But I felt like I felt like
the way he was telling me,

1085
01:02:07,331 --> 01:02:10,450
it was almost like he had talked her into
doing it cause she didn't want to lose

1086
01:02:10,451 --> 01:02:13,090
him as a customer. Right.
You know, times are tough,

1087
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:16,360
you know when you get that steady
700 a week coming from one dude,

1088
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:20,010
you know he's thinking about it.
Do it himself like

1089
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,590
every other day or something. Yeah. Kinda.

1090
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:26,430
He'd like to say fucking find a fat chick
with a mustache and just be like, look,

1091
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,500
we can fuck each other once a week,

1092
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,240
but I have to get really drunk every
time I do it. It's just like, okay,

1093
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,130
you can get jerked up by cute Asian girls.
What are you talking about?

1094
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:38,040
It's ridiculous. Option.
Plateaued on a higher

1095
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,650
human nature son.
You're talking some unrealistic nonsense.

1096
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:48,730
It doesn't work that way. Right.
That's right. Joe, back to you.

1097
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:53,230
And the traffic today is
sponsored by flash lights.

1098
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,230
You totally can be like waiting
for the entertainment tonight.

1099
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:59,890
Right now we've got you as a
comic and we got, yeah. Yeah.

1100
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:02,880
Mary Hart got to light my legs
real nice. Oh that's, you're right.

1101
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:05,030
It was her legs raise them up to this.

1102
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,400
He had a leg greaser for
sometimes it seemed like,

1103
01:03:07,401 --> 01:03:10,340
like sometimes it would go like Mary
hearts legs were just like greasy,

1104
01:03:10,341 --> 01:03:14,610
like she just signed Nana
oil and shit like that. Yeah.

1105
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,290
Isn't that funny man?

1106
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:19,020
Gosh, we're gonna have her own show. Yay.

1107
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:23,510
Makes sense to you. Being
a woman, being a woman,

1108
01:03:23,511 --> 01:03:27,140
seeing like men like freaking
out about body parts and zinc.

1109
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:31,300
Like that's all you need to like sell a
car and some woman with slinky legs like

1110
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,300
folds them over and gets
in the front seat. Yeah.

1111
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,170
Everybody wants to buy that fucking
Cadillac. There's policy demand car.

1112
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:38,550
There's some crazy connection.

1113
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,020
What is it like though to
be a professional woman?

1114
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:45,650
Like how to be a professional sex symbol?
Like dudes are they,

1115
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:48,920
they look at you and 99% of
them are thinking about sex.

1116
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:51,460
So thinking about sex that you've
had and what you're selling.

1117
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:55,080
If I wasn't in the business I'm in,

1118
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:59,060
I feel like people would probably
look at me that way anyway. No.

1119
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,070
Yeah,
because I'm always like,

1120
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:04,770
I'm trying to talk it out with my
coworkers and stuff and I'm like,

1121
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:07,500
I think this guy just wants to
fuck me because I'm a porn star.

1122
01:04:07,501 --> 01:04:10,590
And then like men welfare, I
looked at me and goes, no idiot.

1123
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,860
They want to fuck you because you're
hot. And I'm like, oh, okay. Yeah.

1124
01:04:14,861 --> 01:04:18,420
I can make up whatever backstory.
Even if they've seen like uh, like a,

1125
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:21,030
a digital image on their computer or not.
People can,

1126
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,760
like when you see a
hot girl, you are, have

1127
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,200
your whole, your imaginations run
wild. If I worked with your team,

1128
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:29,960
everybody works. I would want to fuck
you the whole time I was at. Right.

1129
01:04:29,961 --> 01:04:34,350
Body works. Why would I
work at I am not, I've just,

1130
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,860
this is information that I've acquired
from my thesis. Is that what you said?

1131
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:38,590
You're being honest,

1132
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:42,990
but it's also very possible that he
wanted to fuck you because he saw you fuck

1133
01:04:42,991 --> 01:04:45,330
people on film. Right. I
know. I've never watched,

1134
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:49,140
I've watched her fuck one time on
film now. That's fine. Yeah. Was just,

1135
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:55,060
you have to stop looking at me
naked because we're friends now.

1136
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:58,070
That's just not the way that
it goes. Funny. There's,

1137
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,750
there's no social taboo
between you watching porn
that I'm in just because we're

1138
01:05:01,751 --> 01:05:02,010
friends.

1139
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:04,740
A lot of people that I find important,
it's kind of strange there.

1140
01:05:04,741 --> 01:05:07,970
There's lines of the draw, you
know, there's very distinct lines.

1141
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:09,720
Like I remember this couple that I met,

1142
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:11,560
we were doing the man show
and this couple came on.

1143
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:14,610
They were talking about
how they're allowed to fuck
other people while they work.

1144
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:17,070
They're both in porn,
but then off work,

1145
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,770
you're not allowed to just go random my
fuck people. Right. And I was like, wow,

1146
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,630
that's a, that's a weird
distinction. Like how do you,

1147
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:23,770
how do you figure that one out?

1148
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:26,560
I'll get your okay with him
fucking whoever at work.

1149
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:27,820
But that was the other thing.

1150
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:32,560
Like one guy was on the set and his
girlfriend started sucking this guy's Dick

1151
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:35,230
when the camera wasn't running.
Right. He's like, Hey, what the fuck?

1152
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:36,460
And he got all mad.

1153
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,910
How are we creating new? That's where
I'm crazy is that he's like, fucking,

1154
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,670
you guys aren't even filming and she's
just sucking his dick. What's up?

1155
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:45,790
What's up?
I've actually,

1156
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:48,940
I've worked with people and to have the
same kind of thing where it's like, uh,

1157
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:53,350
they can do whatever they want on camera,
but the guy has to like stroke himself.

1158
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:58,480
He's like getting ready to go. Like
the girl can't help it. Like there,

1159
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:02,110
it's like maybe they might be the same
people. I don't know. Isn't that crazy?

1160
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:05,320
But yeah, it's just they're
socially monogamous. Have a rule.

1161
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:09,150
There's a line that you
draw. Well, I of fun.

1162
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:13,810
I used to date a guy in the business and
outside of work we didn't fuck around

1163
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,310
or whatever.
No.

1164
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,490
And he did some things that I found
were questioning them all and he was,

1165
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:21,400
and he was like, there's a camera in
the room. And I was like, you're a fuck.

1166
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:26,200
That's fucked up. That's not the same
thing. Right. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah,

1167
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:30,090
just like one doesn't count.
No, no, no. But I mean, it just,

1168
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:31,721
your,

1169
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,450
your boundaries are your own
and it doesn't matter what
you do for a living just

1170
01:06:34,451 --> 01:06:35,850
because you're a comedian doesn't like,

1171
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:38,480
no one's allowed to tell jokes
in my house besides, you know,

1172
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:42,520
just that's just not the way
that life works. Right. Um,

1173
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:47,100
but you, if you have a, like some kind
of contracts like marriage or you're,

1174
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:50,170
you're with somebody and you say,
okay, well we live together now.

1175
01:06:50,171 --> 01:06:55,171
So like I don't want you sleeping with
other people even though I do porn for

1176
01:06:55,841 --> 01:06:57,880
living. Do you know what
I'm saying? It just,

1177
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:00,550
because that's what you've
arranged between the two of you.

1178
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,970
That's a weird thing though.
Why Range? Anything? Why?

1179
01:07:02,971 --> 01:07:05,130
Why make something that someone can't do?

1180
01:07:05,131 --> 01:07:07,590
If you're allowing the most
sacred of sacred things,

1181
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:11,640
you're allowing this person to fuck
other people right on, on film.

1182
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,150
Why not just allow it to be themselves?
Why put any boundaries just here,

1183
01:07:15,151 --> 01:07:17,370
come here at night and,
and this is where we live.

1184
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:21,210
Cause I dunno if sex is not
that sacred to some people.

1185
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:25,710
Maybe because maybe like
the people that I work with,

1186
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,230
they don't have my address.
Right. You know what I mean?

1187
01:07:28,231 --> 01:07:32,400
And maybe that's a little bit more my
privacy and my security is more sacred to

1188
01:07:32,401 --> 01:07:35,580
me than the actual physical act of sex.
That's true.

1189
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:37,820
Right? Yeah, that's true.
It's like pleasure. It's like,

1190
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,730
would you get mad every
time you masturbated to the
video or you know what I'm

1191
01:07:41,731 --> 01:07:44,900
saying is why put a boundary on it
though? Why put a boundary and not, not,

1192
01:07:44,901 --> 01:07:47,510
not necessarily. I see what you're saying.
What do you want to like letting people

1193
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:51,130
Virgo and they were just, you know, they
want things to be a certain way, you know,

1194
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,110
in our realm of comparability.

1195
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,630
Do what the fuck they want to do and
find someone who you're compatible with

1196
01:07:56,631 --> 01:07:59,090
instead of trying to morph
someone to your expectations.

1197
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:02,300
That's the number one problem
with audible. Yeah. Meet people,

1198
01:08:02,301 --> 01:08:06,440
find people that are incompatible with
them when they try to make them fit and

1199
01:08:06,441 --> 01:08:08,030
it doesn't fucking work that way.
Right.

1200
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:10,610
One person is a control freak and
the other person's anal and whatever,

1201
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:11,650
they don't move.

1202
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:14,510
They don't want to do the thing that
they've agreed that they don't want to do.

1203
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:18,710
You know, like it's not compatible
what they've agreed like, yeah.

1204
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,153
Negatives in there.

1205
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:25,170
[inaudible] they're compatibility.

1206
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:29,370
Oh he that they both, you know,
for what reason or another thing,

1207
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,660
it's okay to do porn,

1208
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:35,040
but outside of work they agree to sleep
with only each other and they come to

1209
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:37,640
that together.
That's definitely a compatibility.

1210
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:39,210
Yeah. Good point. Yeah.
If they're all agree,

1211
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:42,300
if it's not based on necessarily
judgment or whatever,

1212
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:44,370
I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with it.

1213
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,700
I'm just saying it's an odd thing that
you don't have a boundary and someone

1214
01:08:47,701 --> 01:08:49,680
fucking people on camera,

1215
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:54,890
but you do have a boundary with them
doing it for pleasure on their own with

1216
01:08:55,081 --> 01:08:55,914
another person.

1217
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:59,350
Well, just because that might
be emotional art is, or what,

1218
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:04,350
right. It's, it's understood when
you're, when you're fucking lame film.

1219
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:08,430
Exactly. Porn is acting and
athleticism. Athleticism.

1220
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,030
What they're calling it these days.
You should,

1221
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,890
yeah. I'm a crazy person and you
know, and it's not comfortable. It's,

1222
01:09:15,891 --> 01:09:19,220
it's not for you. It's for the
camera. It's, you know, it's,

1223
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:22,260
and it's hard to do something
that does not feel good. Right.

1224
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:24,220
And Act like you feel
like it feels good to,

1225
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,630
you literally get fuck sideways sometimes.
It really fucking hurts it just,

1226
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:31,910
do you ever stretch it out
before shoots? You know, I do. I

1227
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,980
need to. I have like a
huge butt butt hole. Mongo.

1228
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:43,890
Is it easy for you to Poop poop?
Matt,

1229
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:46,140
can you just sit down and like take
care of it and like three seconds.

1230
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:51,970
[inaudible] got Danny Line

1231
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:58,890
launcher
toilet.

1232
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:01,020
Just have an airtight toilet.
She puts her,

1233
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,670
squeezes her legs together and cover their
snatch with her hands so they'll ship,

1234
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:07,230
doesn't blessed off through
the bottom of your legs.

1235
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,310
Just blows out.
Broken a firearm.

1236
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:16,500
Just hang it on.

1237
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,790
She has to take a shower every time
she shit, this is the back of my legs.

1238
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:24,060
Looks like she went
skidding down a muddy hill.

1239
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:30,330
His no containing your shit.
They're assholes like the Lincoln tunnel.

1240
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:36,090
It looks like the back of it looks like
the back of your shirt when it's raining

1241
01:10:36,091 --> 01:10:39,180
outside and you're on your bike
and the mud is skidded up the bat.

1242
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:43,510
Oh,
oh.

1243
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,810
Because I'm disgusted.
I'm discussing it myself as well.

1244
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:54,180
So as the, but you're not, you're
not in the bud section. Real life.

1245
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,390
Just are you good at sex in real life?
Like is it the same as, is that the same?

1246
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:03,740
Are you quitting? Because I like
to exaggerate my movement. Right.

1247
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:08,580
Why don't you do that in real life? Lazy
Bitch. Very stationary. Are you like,

1248
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:13,170
I'm only on the top. I'm only on the
ball down and like are you serious?

1249
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,520
Down into tempurpedic

1250
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:14,830
bed?

1251
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:19,460
Yeah. Yeah. Well, Hey, I, uh, a
little bit. Yeah, it makes sense.

1252
01:11:19,461 --> 01:11:23,930
You're a big fuck off. Does it
make sense naturally, genetically.

1253
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:26,960
Danida a strong man to turn your arm.
Like being,

1254
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,770
you want to let you want to feel that
if this guy wanted to take it, yeah,

1255
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:35,350
he could take it. Sure. That's what it is.
It's natural. You're a big girl. Not Bad.

1256
01:11:35,351 --> 01:11:37,750
Not in a bad way. You
are a good specimen. You,

1257
01:11:37,751 --> 01:11:39,340
if you wanted to make warrior children,

1258
01:11:39,341 --> 01:11:43,990
you'd be a good specimen for your children
with flexible buttholes, you'd be,

1259
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:45,920
you have the perfect DNA for it.
Yes.

1260
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:50,540
Is it hard to, to, to be, to date people
as a porn star, do you find or does,

1261
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,280
is it like more of a challenge?
Yeah,

1262
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:54,240
it depends on the person.

1263
01:11:54,241 --> 01:11:59,160
I did it a guy a couple
years ago and when we met,

1264
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:03,450
like he knew what I did and stuff like
that and I did not want to be involved

1265
01:12:03,451 --> 01:12:04,920
with him.
And then

1266
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:09,030
we started sleeping together
after a really long time.

1267
01:12:09,031 --> 01:12:12,510
We kind of like worn me down a little
bit and then after that it was like kind

1268
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:16,180
of fucked up. It was, we weren't off to a
good start. Um, I'll admit, but you know,

1269
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,870
I get bored too.
Um,

1270
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:23,900
so after we like started dating
or are fucking fucking in dating,

1271
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:31,520
he then like looked at porn that I was
an and decided that he wanted to be a

1272
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:34,980
spazz about it and be like,
I don't know,

1273
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:38,490
like knowing you do those types of
things, I don't know. And I'm like, yeah,

1274
01:12:38,491 --> 01:12:39,510
you already knew.

1275
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:43,560
But now that now you want to be bothered
because you're a drama queen has

1276
01:12:43,561 --> 01:12:45,970
nothing to do with what I
do. It's just that, you know,

1277
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:50,450
feelings were awesome feelings. We're
also getting, you know, starting now,

1278
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,220
they'd be four.
It was like zero feelings.

1279
01:12:52,221 --> 01:12:54,530
I just want to fuck you now
the now it's starting to cut,

1280
01:12:54,531 --> 01:12:56,840
like love gets involved. You know?
I think that's probably a Max

1281
01:12:57,370 --> 01:12:58,440
process of wearing you down.

1282
01:12:58,441 --> 01:13:02,890
It's like I don't judge you like I think
it's fine and it's like really great

1283
01:13:02,891 --> 01:13:07,300
because you're really successful. And
then I just kind of nose dived into like,

1284
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,180
ah, yeah, you do those things.

1285
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:13,060
I think for a lot of men
it's very important when
they meet a girl that they're

1286
01:13:13,061 --> 01:13:14,110
sexually attracted to,

1287
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:18,370
they want that girl liked them and I think
that is the root of a lot of bullshit.

1288
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,250
And the guys don't even realize
they're doing it. It's a genetic thing.

1289
01:13:21,251 --> 01:13:25,060
It's a predisposition to wanting
to be sexually attractive.

1290
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:27,580
And so they start pretending
to be someone who they're not.

1291
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:30,910
And then they get into the relationship
and then it's a couple months in and

1292
01:13:30,911 --> 01:13:33,820
they're relaxed and comfortable
and they're like, why am
I with this crazy bitch?

1293
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:37,450
I don't even, I'm not even into this.
And Yeah. Yeah. It's like there's a,

1294
01:13:37,451 --> 01:13:40,390
there's a lot of dudes that are
just trying to put it together.

1295
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:45,460
Like they don't have the luxury of like
actually being honest and trying to like

1296
01:13:45,461 --> 01:13:46,810
meet someone that they actually like,

1297
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,560
they're so caught up in the game of trying
to fuck a chick and it's so difficult

1298
01:13:50,561 --> 01:13:53,410
for them. Then when they finally get
one they tackle or they get it in there.

1299
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:57,480
Yeah. They're like, ah, got one. Good.
Okay. What did I pretend to be doing?

1300
01:13:57,730 --> 01:14:00,490
Do this.
I'm not a fucking Vegan.

1301
01:14:00,491 --> 01:14:05,491
I want us to start wearing
the beads and stuff.

1302
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:08,013
You know,

1303
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,990
they meet a girl that's willing to fuck
them like once every couple months.

1304
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:12,370
They got to work hard

1305
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:17,370
to take it down so they pretend to
be someone and not using plates.

1306
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:22,660
Just sex for lie. We,
we do together is love.

1307
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:23,610
That's just

1308
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:28,050
a movie you're making, right? Oh yeah.
That same drama guy. He was like,

1309
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:33,290
yeah, I was like being really depressed
or something like that. And he,

1310
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:35,100
he would like one of the lay it on me.
Like,

1311
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:39,870
you can't live inside your own pain
and I love you. And I was like, Huh,

1312
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:44,250
get the fuck out. You're
creeping me out. You can weird.

1313
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:48,980
I don't know where you heard that
shit. Fuck out of you in here.

1314
01:14:48,981 --> 01:14:53,210
This is something that you think,
yeah, I was like, you're full of shit

1315
01:14:55,470 --> 01:14:58,920
out. Never had come back the
worst. Leave my phone number,

1316
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:03,930
sexually unattractive thing ever is
someone's full of Shit, which is so gross.

1317
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:08,700
People are full of Shit. Like, Oh
God. It's such a, such a bummer.

1318
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:12,450
You know when you hear someone say some
nonsense and then you have to mock them

1319
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:16,710
and then they get mad at you for Maka
them and it all fucking falls apart. Oh,

1320
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:20,580
I used to date this girl who used
to write poetry and it was nonsense.

1321
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,570
It was nonsense.
It was,

1322
01:15:24,571 --> 01:15:26,010
I mean it was her form of expression,

1323
01:15:26,011 --> 01:15:31,011
but it was so clearly affected and fake
and just designed to like fucking fire

1324
01:15:32,941 --> 01:15:36,480
off all the rights and it was
just so artificial, so clear,

1325
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:40,380
so clear that it was just a bullshit that
she was slinging. It was so offensive.

1326
01:15:40,381 --> 01:15:43,410
Or you a poetry snob though?
Or do you like it just like high quality?

1327
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,520
I love the counseling. You know what
I love about Koski and you know,

1328
01:15:47,521 --> 01:15:50,870
I mean it's a lot of his stores are like
really dark is a little poem, but it's,

1329
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:53,700
that's a fuck with that guys
thinking about for real. Yeah.

1330
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:55,540
That is his real life and switch thing on.

1331
01:15:55,680 --> 01:16:00,680
That's all require of an artist with what
inflames me is when I think someone is

1332
01:16:01,021 --> 01:16:02,340
trying to pretend to be someone else,

1333
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:06,360
whether it's a human or a singer
or a comedian or an actor.

1334
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,930
If I feel like you're bullshitting me,
I feel like you're bullshitting me.

1335
01:16:09,931 --> 01:16:13,530
It's offensive. Yeah. Read me.
You're fucking crazy. Poetry Hooker,

1336
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,480
the felting tier intelligent.
You're,

1337
01:16:15,481 --> 01:16:18,060
you're mad at me that I'm
laughing at this nonsense.

1338
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,830
That was a horror story
from vit doing porn. What's,

1339
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:23,610
what's one thing that sticks out?
Just you fucking like,

1340
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:28,680
just awful experience. Did
you ever like say, okay,

1341
01:16:28,681 --> 01:16:29,514
never again.

1342
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:30,750
Um,

1343
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:35,570
I used to do a lot of like
BDSM stuff where I was a sub.

1344
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:38,810
That is, and I will get beat. Explain
that to everybody who's not crazy.

1345
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,740
He DSM, most people don't
have any idea what that means.

1346
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:44,490
Bonded.
Well,

1347
01:16:44,491 --> 01:16:48,730
it's like sadomasochism
s and M is sadomasochism.

1348
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:53,190
When you say a were the one that they
tortured, sub submissive and dominant.

1349
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:58,240
So it's bondage and dominatrix.
No, some shit like that. Yeah,

1350
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:02,240
it's like a code, I dunno. Whatever.
Right. It's like being in the army. Yeah.

1351
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:06,990
Easy. Yeah. It's like the same things.

1352
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:10,010
You try to invent little
short things of them.

1353
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,250
So um, yeah, it would,

1354
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:17,570
it'd be like electrocuted
and tight and like, you know,

1355
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,140
hit with different, your nipples, nipples,

1356
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:24,920
like in your body with like pads
my pussy inside and said my boss,

1357
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,290
oh my God. Like while in like very
strict bondage and stuff like that.

1358
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,660
My God, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

1359
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:33,350
Challenging.
You know?

1360
01:17:33,351 --> 01:17:37,700
And it was something that
was really legitimately
interested in when I was in my

1361
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,730
early twenties and it's something
that I thought that maybe, you know,

1362
01:17:40,731 --> 01:17:44,390
so I consider myself to be a kind of
a tough person and I felt like if I,

1363
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:49,140
if I've met these challenges, it
would prove how tough I was. God Damn.

1364
01:17:49,141 --> 01:17:50,180
Wow.
Yeah,

1365
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:53,150
I dunno it.
Inside your pothole,

1366
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:56,390
what percentage of the population is
ever been electric unit inside the there?

1367
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,560
I mean,
they produce like the tens unit,

1368
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,930
send the, I mean they're sold like as
medical equipment and stuff like that.

1369
01:18:02,931 --> 01:18:05,210
I'm sure a fair amount of people
have gotten their hands on them,

1370
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:10,780
you know? So I don't know. I don't
have the numbers in front of me said,

1371
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:12,030
well let me stick this thing on my

1372
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:16,820
full battery on your asshole.

1373
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:21,970
[inaudible] when you're about
to calm nine up your ass.

1374
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:30,020
Oh,
iron man loads.

1375
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:35,720
You don't know though. Oh, I think I do

1376
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:40,190
have a penis.
Makes the guy shoot longer,

1377
01:18:40,191 --> 01:18:44,630
loads more experience with more penises.

1378
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,310
You don't know that.
There's no

1379
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,120
more than willing to
submit to you on those

1380
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,500
outfitting the entire room.
Me.

1381
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,240
So how long did this whole session take?

1382
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:05,030
Weather electrocuting your
vagina and your asshole

1383
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:09,550
man. It was a first that
called wired pussy.com. Yeah,

1384
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:13,410
so it's all electric shooting pussies.
There's a site

1385
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:19,970
female on female sub dom and the electric
policies play like you play games,

1386
01:19:21,601 --> 01:19:23,430
like who can take the most electricity

1387
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:27,450
or they'll chase blindfolded and partially
tied up women around with a cattle

1388
01:19:27,451 --> 01:19:32,160
prod. That makes noise. And
you could either go toward
it or away from the sound,

1389
01:19:32,161 --> 01:19:33,870
but if you go away from the sound,

1390
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:37,700
just when I thought get in trouble,
some of the darkness. Yeah, no, that's,

1391
01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:42,090
that's where I started. That's where I
stopped. Ever had your pee hole fucked.

1392
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:43,640
Whoa.

1393
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,300
There's videos out there of guys.

1394
01:19:48,301 --> 01:19:52,470
Fucking girls is really small and
it stretches just like your asshole.

1395
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:58,290
I'm very sensitive in my whole
life. Don't, don't say never.

1396
01:19:58,291 --> 01:19:59,830
You got to reach goals.
You gotta you gotta

1397
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:03,820
of my body.

1398
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,810
I went through a phase of like piercing
and stuff like that when I was younger.

1399
01:20:06,811 --> 01:20:08,100
I did some tattoo above

1400
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,240
the cookie.
I do,

1401
01:20:09,241 --> 01:20:13,950
but I'm having it removed and that is so
fucking painful than any like butthole

1402
01:20:13,951 --> 01:20:15,670
electrocution I've ever gotten.
Really.

1403
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:20,130
Laser Tattoo removal
is so painful. It, um,

1404
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:24,270
like agitate the Inca molecule and
your skin and makes it explode.

1405
01:20:24,271 --> 01:20:28,290
And with each treatment it just gets
smaller and smaller and it grow.

1406
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,480
It metabolizes out of your body.
Right?

1407
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:34,190
You have to wait a couple of months in
between sessions just like long enough

1408
01:20:34,191 --> 01:20:37,440
that you could forget how
much fucking pain you are in.

1409
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:40,350
You have to go in and do it again.
Fuck that.

1410
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:45,200
I'm just keeping waterfalls. Just kissing
it. Got An old tattoo. Tramp stamp.

1411
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:47,540
Yup. Yup. It's around my belly leading.

1412
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:51,740
I'm going to sleep on my right arm and
I have an old tattoo up here that I have

1413
01:20:51,741 --> 01:20:55,880
to get removed, go off just
yet. Just get black black box.

1414
01:20:56,230 --> 01:20:58,670
But it's just black flag.
How much,

1415
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:00,980
how much worse is it than
the actual tattooing?

1416
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:06,420
So much worse because you have to go
like 20 times and it mines and it's like

1417
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:09,520
just like a very,
uh,

1418
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:13,570
it's like you could feel like the impact
of the laser going into your skin.

1419
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,720
It feels like being snapped to
the rubber band really hard.

1420
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:21,210
It instantly burns that it makes
your skin swell up and lot.

1421
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:24,370
Why when you get a tattoo, it's kind
of scratches the surface of your skin.

1422
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:28,660
When you get lasered, it's like
effecting the color inside your skin.

1423
01:21:28,661 --> 01:21:31,360
So the blood kind of
seeps out like a sponge.

1424
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:36,120
No, I'm going to, I'm going to wait for
technology to get a little bit better.

1425
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:39,370
He just turned me the fuck off.
Don't do it.

1426
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:42,090
And thinking about cooking my arm
like that, I'm like, what am I doing?

1427
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:44,200
Like that you could damage your skin,
right?

1428
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:47,810
No, I mean it's safe. It
doesn't scar. Doesn't know that.

1429
01:21:47,811 --> 01:21:50,600
I mean that's the purpose of it being
such a long, slow process. I mean,

1430
01:21:50,601 --> 01:21:52,740
you could just cut it
off if you wanted to,

1431
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:56,090
but I wouldn't say that
that's the best idea ever.

1432
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,390
Right.
So let me ask you this.

1433
01:21:57,391 --> 01:21:59,700
And wired pussy.com calls you
up next week and says, Hey,

1434
01:21:59,701 --> 01:22:02,400
we're looking to do a shoot.
And you're done with that. Yeah.

1435
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,610
Yeah. I would top, I've, I've
gotten back to be the dom.

1436
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:09,120
It's a portrait girls from
snapchat because I feel
like I can confidently say I

1437
01:22:09,121 --> 01:22:12,540
know what I'm doing and I wouldn't do
something to somebody else that I haven't

1438
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:16,590
had done to myself, but I know
what it feels like. I know.

1439
01:22:16,591 --> 01:22:19,710
And if they're not a bad ass bitch like
me, then they don't get to fuck me.

1440
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:22,150
Would you ever do far porn? Yeah. Yeah.

1441
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:25,670
For all the time and my
movies in your movie,

1442
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,570
it's just like when you
get fucked in the ass,

1443
01:22:27,571 --> 01:22:30,750
like your butt is open and gaping is like
the big thing where they want to see,

1444
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,760
they want to see her lower colon,

1445
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:37,761
they want to see it all in age 13
I don't know why people like it,

1446
01:22:38,611 --> 01:22:41,820
they just do and I, you know, and
just whatever. So like the air,

1447
01:22:41,821 --> 01:22:45,360
it goes into your calves out and then
you have to kind of fight it out and not

1448
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:48,610
look I far like I'm eating
can of beans like a Hobo.

1449
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:52,860
Right, right. My farts on fire
accidentally ever sprayed?

1450
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:55,790
No, no. I think I've,

1451
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:58,750
I've accidentally peed on
people at work and then be like,

1452
01:22:58,751 --> 01:23:02,770
I'm squinting or whenever.
And I dunno what is squirting exactly.

1453
01:23:02,771 --> 01:23:06,860
Is it really when in the movies,
girls like shooting. All right.

1454
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:10,100
Obviously you can see it coming
out of her pee hole. Right? I'm,

1455
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:14,650
I'm assuming that a lot of people that
watch these movies don't know what a

1456
01:23:14,651 --> 01:23:18,490
vagina looks like or anything and
they don't know that where the,

1457
01:23:18,491 --> 01:23:23,000
all the liquid shooting out of
the girl's vagina area or her,

1458
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,070
her love zone or whatever nerves call it.
Yeah.

1459
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:27,590
But isn't that he,
hey,

1460
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:30,900
but hold on a second because that's where
it would come out anyway because isn't

1461
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:34,300
a pee hole like literally like when a
woman gets her testosterone treatment,

1462
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:37,690
it become a man. Her clit grows.
I become like a small penis,

1463
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,990
Pussy Boehner and that the penis is
obviously where any sexual ejaculate would

1464
01:23:40,991 --> 01:23:43,150
come out of. So of course it's
going to come out of where you pee.

1465
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:45,460
I don't know.

1466
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:46,960
What is it?
Is it real?

1467
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:51,970
I mean this is did I used to date a girl
that fucking juiced on me and it was

1468
01:23:51,971 --> 01:23:55,540
like in my belly button, like a puddle and
it was, it wasn't p though. It was just,

1469
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:56,100
it was like,

1470
01:23:56,100 --> 01:24:00,070
because a broth,
you know

1471
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:06,210
when the woman's vagina gets moist,
it's not dripping over pee hole.

1472
01:24:06,211 --> 01:24:09,630
It's coming from inside. I don't think
this is moistened it's not lubricant.

1473
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,210
That's,
that's what squirting is supposed to be.

1474
01:24:12,211 --> 01:24:14,340
And when you'll see it
coming out of the pee hole

1475
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:19,060
p Whoa. Yeah. That it was supposed to
in a lot of times where you see like

1476
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:23,660
Spiderman like trick that they do when
they like finger the pussy and I like

1477
01:24:23,661 --> 01:24:28,100
press like on the outside of the man.
So he does his web.

1478
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:30,200
Yeah.
This is like the axle Bron method.

1479
01:24:30,201 --> 01:24:33,020
I watched instructional videos and
I was like, what are they doing?

1480
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:38,350
And they're basically just like pushing
on the bladder and just forcing people

1481
01:24:38,561 --> 01:24:43,430
to come out. Jesus Christ. Yeah.
And then just exactly what it is.

1482
01:24:43,431 --> 01:24:46,450
Like if you had to force piano somebody,
that's exactly how you would do it. Wow.

1483
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:49,090
So that's what all that's
spraying is. So there is, yeah.

1484
01:24:49,091 --> 01:24:51,430
So girls are spraying on dudes.
They're pissing all over him.

1485
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:56,810
Yeah. Unless they have like an extra
juicy g spot or something like that.

1486
01:24:56,811 --> 01:24:58,460
Like I'm not going to say like,

1487
01:24:58,490 --> 01:25:03,200
I'm not going to say female ejaculation
is a myth because I'm not a doctor and I

1488
01:25:03,201 --> 01:25:07,280
can't say that.
I mean and you know,

1489
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:10,310
put these get wet and some pussies
are wetter than others. Yeah.

1490
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:13,970
We're talking to an expert here. Dan
D Armaun here. 11 I'm not a doctor.

1491
01:25:13,971 --> 01:25:15,770
Not a doctor all in.
Now can you put,

1492
01:25:15,771 --> 01:25:18,710
can you put a condom on a dick with just
putting it in your mouth and doing that

1493
01:25:18,711 --> 01:25:23,360
trick? I cannot even remember the
last time I used a condom. God Damn.

1494
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:25,550
Wow.
Do you ever worry about diseases?

1495
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:28,250
No. I get tested every three weeks. Yeah.

1496
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,900
So how do you keep clean when you're just,

1497
01:25:30,901 --> 01:25:33,560
everybody gets tested every three weeks,
right?

1498
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:37,410
Then you have three weeks for a
porn star though. Jesus Christ.

1499
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,270
How many you don't do like,
sorry.

1500
01:25:39,271 --> 01:25:43,980
Dick's can you be exposed to like I
worked with mark would twice last week.

1501
01:25:43,981 --> 01:25:47,640
So it's like the same, same wiener,
same, same wiener. Same Week.

1502
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:51,900
You guys develop like a relationship
when you have like on screen?

1503
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:56,570
Yeah. Uh, I mean I think the
people I work with are cool.

1504
01:25:56,571 --> 01:26:01,340
It's not like I'm like, Ooh, like I'm so
horny for you. Let's do things after that.

1505
01:26:01,341 --> 01:26:04,610
How many of them long? He's
married Francesco Lay, you know,

1506
01:26:04,611 --> 01:26:06,230
and they were fucking awesome.
And I know both of them.

1507
01:26:06,231 --> 01:26:07,340
I've worked with both of them.

1508
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,450
Dudes that are in porn wanted
to do mainstream things.

1509
01:26:10,451 --> 01:26:13,450
We couldn't make it and have like
some sort of a weird thing where they,

1510
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:14,620
I don't know.

1511
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:19,790
It seems to be like a lot of guys are
musicians and they're all like trying to

1512
01:26:19,961 --> 01:26:24,070
get together like a band with
all the other dude's Dick. Yeah.

1513
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:24,943
Soon as you call it,

1514
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:30,070
that'd be a bad ass name for a band
playing and Dick Dick. I mean I don't,

1515
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:34,210
maybe I'm uh, I dunno. Maybe
I'm just like, Oh, I'm at work,

1516
01:26:34,211 --> 01:26:34,991
I'm doing my work things.

1517
01:26:34,991 --> 01:26:37,930
But I didn't really ask people too much
about their particular with Tyler night.

1518
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,390
Yeah.
Tyler was a very good friend of mine.

1519
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,950
We were actually just both on Star
Trek, the next generation. Oh really?

1520
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:48,400
A triple x parity digital says
in revelation snacks coming soon.

1521
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:51,610
And that was like a bitch. He
was Jordy. Yeah. And I was,

1522
01:26:51,611 --> 01:26:55,270
she's a huge star trek fan.
I'm a nerd. I was stoked.

1523
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:56,770
I called my dad and I was like,

1524
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,860
I'm reading for the part of Ensign Rao
for the star trek parody. And he was like,

1525
01:26:59,861 --> 01:27:04,150
that's so cool. And I was like, no dad,
if I don't get this part, I'll die.

1526
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:07,210
Like super seriously. Like, no, I need,

1527
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:10,510
this has to be my part
or I'm freaking out.

1528
01:27:10,710 --> 01:27:14,490
Tyler is a friend of mine from
Jujitsu and he's a really good writer.

1529
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:16,800
Have you ever read any of this stuff?
No.

1530
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:21,390
He's got a blog online and he's
very smart. He's such a cool guy.

1531
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:23,560
He's smart and he's very polite.

1532
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:26,250
Yeah, he's very well spoken.
He was on the podcast,

1533
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:29,160
but we had him on and he's a very,
he's a fascinating dude,

1534
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:31,650
but I already knew that from
talking to him at Jujitsu and stuff,

1535
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:34,440
but his writing is great.
Really interesting stuff.

1536
01:27:34,441 --> 01:27:36,360
And his writings about the porn business,

1537
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:40,110
he's got this one story that he wrote
about a gang bang that is, she's like,

1538
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:44,880
you fucking feel the loads on the floor.
Like as you're reading it,

1539
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:49,140
you feel like the sticky room, you feel
the heat of all these guys behind him.

1540
01:27:49,141 --> 01:27:54,141
He does a masterful job of describing
this fucking incredibly Gonzo bizarre film

1541
01:27:55,651 --> 01:27:56,600
that they're doing there.
The me,

1542
01:27:56,601 --> 01:27:58,620
you would get paid 50
bucks and you wait in line.

1543
01:27:58,621 --> 01:28:01,260
You're like one of a hundred
guys waiting to, you know,

1544
01:28:01,261 --> 01:28:03,750
and you're jerking yourself off as you're
getting up to this girl who was just

1545
01:28:03,751 --> 01:28:06,570
covered in loads.
There's loads all over the ground.

1546
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,100
Everywhere you walk there's loads,
right?

1547
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:11,960
It's just like slippery and wet. You're
stepping, become everywhere, clothes,

1548
01:28:12,090 --> 01:28:12,923
everywhere you go.

1549
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:16,530
There's this little signs that say
slippery when wet that they have to put up

1550
01:28:16,531 --> 01:28:20,970
around the woman.
Who's the first person

1551
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:21,940
do that.
Was it Houston?

1552
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:25,750
Was she the first or the week before was
probably before I was born because the

1553
01:28:25,751 --> 01:28:28,770
numbers keep going up, you know, at
one point in time it was like the,

1554
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:33,670
the most people and I think she had
sex with like 200 Annabella Chong

1555
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:36,880
and she's got a, it's a fascinating
documentary and like you,

1556
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,230
she's very intelligent. She's
very unusual. Um, she was, uh,

1557
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:45,640
I think she was a student at Ucla. I might
be wrong, Ucla or USC, but she was like,

1558
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:50,670
she's an intelligent person and she
just had this weird desire to test the

1559
01:28:50,681 --> 01:28:52,360
boundaries of, of Er, you know,

1560
01:28:52,390 --> 01:28:57,160
acceptable sexuality by doing a gang
bang film. But it was really interesting.

1561
01:28:57,161 --> 01:29:01,590
Like it was a, it was cause it was, you
know, they're really like got into her,

1562
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:02,700
her psychology

1563
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:06,330
and who she is and like thought this is
a complex sort of a fucking case where

1564
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:09,990
this woman wants to experience
the ultimate taboo. You know

1565
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:12,930
and my agent called me
one time when he was like,

1566
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:17,610
what's the most number of coffee all back
and one like one time and I was like I

1567
01:29:17,611 --> 01:29:21,400
don't fucking care, you
know. And he was like, no.

1568
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:23,130
How about 11 I was like hi.

1569
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:28,140
And like what difference does it make if
I fuck 11 dudes and the same day or in

1570
01:29:29,251 --> 01:29:32,160
pairs of you know one's
two's and three's on

1571
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,420
I have to like the third
or fourth giant black cock.

1572
01:29:35,421 --> 01:29:37,480
You're numb lips when
started getting numb. No.

1573
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:42,210
In your head though is 11 cock days.
That same amount of time

1574
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:45,010
when you stretch your mouth.
I don't like that shit.

1575
01:29:45,011 --> 01:29:47,950
Would that seems like it would make
your lips number? Yeah, the huge mouth.

1576
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:50,980
I do have a huge one.
It's good for my career comes in handy.

1577
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:54,470
Now did you know that you wanted to be
a porn star when you were younger or is

1578
01:29:54,471 --> 01:29:54,620
this

1579
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:56,690
no, I, I did.

1580
01:29:56,700 --> 01:30:01,700
I actually did like part of this as like
a bit of a with the midnight show go

1581
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:06,250
guys. They did this your life.
Bob Guccione the midnight
show guys. What is it?

1582
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:10,040
The UCB. Okay. You know,
how, how redneck and stuff.

1583
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:11,673
And um,

1584
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,660
I was like, oh, this is your
life Bob. Guccione and, and
I come out and I'm like, Oh,

1585
01:30:17,661 --> 01:30:22,130
I've been such a big fan of
you for forever and stuff.
Um, because when I, with,

1586
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:26,720
uh, like in the first grade,
probably six years old,

1587
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:31,430
I found a stack of playboy
magazines that were in the woods.

1588
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:36,010
[inaudible] they were my uncles.
My uncle stayed with us part time hours,

1589
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:40,190
you know, they were just like out in
his room. And I, and I remember I took,

1590
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:44,030
I took one of those magazines to school
all to first grade and I was like,

1591
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:48,500
this is what a naked lady looks like.
You know, I was like such a boy.

1592
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:53,360
I was at a tomboy when I was that
age, but I, but even then I was like,

1593
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:58,690
this is like what a sexy lady looks
like and I want to grow up and this is,

1594
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:03,800
you know, I want to turn out like this
sexy lady. Like that's kind of like,

1595
01:31:03,801 --> 01:31:08,390
that appealed to me. I thought,
wow, she's, she's gorgeous.
She's all made up, she's,

1596
01:31:08,391 --> 01:31:13,340
you know, pretty and
naked, thin, nice boobs,

1597
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:16,300
you know. And I was like, yeah, that like
really appealed to me. From your room

1598
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:18,320
girls before you started doing movies.

1599
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:23,620
Yeah. And I, and I also thought like
if I'm, if I don't turn out to be this,

1600
01:31:23,621 --> 01:31:25,510
I had like a fail safe in my brain.
I was like,

1601
01:31:25,511 --> 01:31:29,620
if I don't turn out to be a sexy lady,
I would at least want to be it with one,

1602
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:32,680
like have one like us, my
girlfriend or like just, you know,

1603
01:31:32,681 --> 01:31:36,490
be in the presence of that because
it was appealing to me and I found it

1604
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:40,010
attractive. Hmm. I'm a gay,

1605
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:48,280
I came on your show because I want to say
that I'm out a big pussy Boehner and I

1606
01:31:48,981 --> 01:31:52,100
have a placebo owner and I take it.

1607
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:55,800
So how did you get into your first film?
How did it come and get a hold of you?

1608
01:31:57,010 --> 01:32:01,150
I shoot seven years,
seven years,

1609
01:32:01,151 --> 01:32:05,380
24 when I got in and I'll be 32 inches.
Before that I was a stripper.

1610
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:07,270
I was a drunk stripper too.

1611
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:11,100
And how did, what did someone approach
you and say, Hey, I like the way, yeah,

1612
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:16,150
no, absolutely not. No,
actually quit drinking.

1613
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:18,310
I think I already told
this story on your show.

1614
01:32:18,311 --> 01:32:22,990
Maybe I quit drinking and I got fired
from being a stripper and I had been

1615
01:32:22,991 --> 01:32:27,991
thinking about applying to this porn
site because at fucking machines on it,

1616
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:29,920
and this is how I got into the business.

1617
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:35,260
I just have sure like morbid curiosity
of fucking a robot and just really

1618
01:32:36,761 --> 01:32:39,880
thinking about it. And he's like
masturbate in the shower, right

1619
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:42,560
in a robot and a robot on the
inner. I heard it too. Totally.

1620
01:32:42,561 --> 01:32:45,320
And I heard it's awful, by the
way. What was your experience like?

1621
01:32:45,321 --> 01:32:49,430
Fucking Michigan. A lot of fun
to talk to girls. It's fucked.

1622
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:52,020
Robots actually talked about
it today. No joke. Really bad.

1623
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:53,710
It comes up all the time for

1624
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:59,060
the face that people feel like they
can approach you and talk about fucking

1625
01:32:59,061 --> 01:32:59,894
robot.

1626
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:03,080
Seems like the guy gotta be in it and
you were really kind of in a nerdy thing,

1627
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,073
one of those spaces.

1628
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:08,910
So yeah,
I just ended up applying to that site.

1629
01:33:08,911 --> 01:33:11,700
And that's how I got to do all that
bondage stuff is because it's the same

1630
01:33:11,701 --> 01:33:16,080
company ran hog tied and wired pussy
and all these holes and they even have a

1631
01:33:16,081 --> 01:33:19,940
female wrestling say ultimate surrender
where they have women wrestling. They,

1632
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:24,490
the market cornered on kinky
pain shit. Yeah, absolutely. Wow.

1633
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:28,810
What a weird business. Zimmer by the
armory up in San Francisco, they,

1634
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:30,400
it's basically like a castle.

1635
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:33,060
You know what I saw that
online or on a television show,

1636
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:36,010
whether there was some sort of an expo
say on it about how much money they make

1637
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:38,290
and how big their businesses enormous.

1638
01:33:38,370 --> 01:33:40,410
But they also,
they really improve that neighborhood.

1639
01:33:40,411 --> 01:33:43,950
They give back to their community. They
do a lot of stuff. Um, you know, they,

1640
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:48,870
they open their uh, Joel Court to, uh,

1641
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:52,290
you know, when they have parades and
shit. Like people can set up their floats.

1642
01:33:52,291 --> 01:33:53,124
They opened their,

1643
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:57,660
their private business to the community
to do things or have swap meets inside

1644
01:33:57,661 --> 01:33:58,494
there.

1645
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,333
So Nasco,

1646
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:02,640
it's like a crazy jungle of naked
people running around and like

1647
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:07,510
fucking right, like the people
in offices, like on computers.

1648
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:08,130
San Francisco's

1649
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:11,040
as a place where that would be accepted
in San Francisco's, in my opinion,

1650
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:13,310
it's the most open minded
city and the whole,

1651
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:16,100
you'd be surprised there were in the Wall
Street Journal I'm talking about like

1652
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:19,570
people are there, we know there's
people fucking in there and yeah.

1653
01:34:19,710 --> 01:34:22,020
What does it matter? There's always
going to be some people like that,

1654
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:24,080
but the amount of people that were sick,

1655
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:25,620
where do you think their
neighbors came from?

1656
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:27,320
Well that would support,

1657
01:34:27,321 --> 01:34:30,260
it would be much larger in San
Francisco than anywhere else.

1658
01:34:30,261 --> 01:34:33,300
Of course you're always going to come
across people that are very vocal that one

1659
01:34:33,301 --> 01:34:34,160
of the fight something,

1660
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:37,580
but all in all San Francisco
is the most open minded city,

1661
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:38,990
I think in the whole country.

1662
01:34:39,450 --> 01:34:40,283
Hmm.

1663
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:44,360
Steady on that. I mean, could
you imagine that happening? Sure.

1664
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:48,170
Cargo where there's a whole block filled
with people that are tying people up

1665
01:34:48,171 --> 01:34:50,030
and fucking them with
rubber robots and shit.

1666
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:53,910
You know, that can only take
place in like San Francisco. Yeah.

1667
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:55,040
I don't think there's any
other place that could,

1668
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:58,160
that would accept something like New York
maybe. I mean, it seems like New York

1669
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:01,130
has a lot of fucking of the bondage clubs,
New York and La,

1670
01:35:01,131 --> 01:35:02,870
or would it be only other options?
I think,

1671
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:06,800
and I think that'd be met with a lot more
resistance in New York. La, Europe. Yeah.

1672
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:10,100
Anywhere. Yeah. Berlin,
Budapest. Who was in, um, uh,

1673
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:15,020
Berlin and I turned on the
television and um, no, not Berlin.

1674
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:18,350
Oberhausen Oberhausen and I turned on
the television and there was no gang bang

1675
01:35:18,351 --> 01:35:21,710
on TV. Just a full on gang
bang. Let's just, no warning.

1676
01:35:21,711 --> 01:35:23,810
Just flipping through the
channels. Wow. The, yeah,

1677
01:35:23,811 --> 01:35:26,510
there's 10 people fucking in a
room. I'm like, wow, this is wild.

1678
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,680
Like they have a totally
different attitude about it.

1679
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:30,980
They just show the Shit on television.
It's pretty intense.

1680
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:32,810
What are you doing it right?
Looking at,

1681
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:38,380
I just looked at the basis for
Alice in chains died when Mike Star,

1682
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:42,560
I don't know. Yeah. So you don't care.

1683
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:48,170
He was on celebrity rehab.
I don't know if you remember him.

1684
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:52,970
They found his body in Salt Lake City.

1685
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:54,890
Well, Charlie, Shane lives winning.

1686
01:35:56,210 --> 01:36:00,530
He doesn't have tiger blood. I
don't know. I'm a Tanish DNA,

1687
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:03,950
just not a freaking rock star from Mars.
Well,

1688
01:36:03,951 --> 01:36:08,920
I guess that guy probably didn't have to
pay girl $30,000 to have sex with them

1689
01:36:08,921 --> 01:36:12,320
either. Is probably has. He's got a lot of
money. Shit, I don't make things happen.

1690
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:13,620
He's a rockstar.

1691
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:18,830
Tracing is Charlie's Socom doughy like
slippery sweaty guy with five kids.

1692
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:21,680
Charlie,
Charlie Sheen.

1693
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:24,930
I would rather pick a rock star then
like somebody has fucking five kids.

1694
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:27,290
But the crazy thing is the Charlie
Sheen calls himself a rock star,

1695
01:36:27,291 --> 01:36:31,890
but he's on this.
I like forgot that he was like the longest

1696
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:37,790
family Sitcom, you know? I mean it's
like this really bland, you know,

1697
01:36:37,791 --> 01:36:41,450
kind of do it out to the walk. You
know? There's no edge to it. The egg,

1698
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:45,350
like really vanilla, you know? And
it's, yeah, it's the number one comedy.

1699
01:36:45,351 --> 01:36:46,700
For some reason I talked
to my friend today,

1700
01:36:46,701 --> 01:36:49,540
he's watches it every week and I'm
like, really? You Watch that show

1701
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:52,310
Charlie Sheen?
And like a gay guy?

1702
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:56,260
Yeah, yeah. But he's like, well, it's
like, it's the exact same show every week,

1703
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:59,290
you know? It's like the same premise
every week, but he's like, it's, it's,

1704
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:01,570
it's one of those shows you could
just kind of watch, you know,

1705
01:37:01,571 --> 01:37:06,370
and it's easy to watch is smooth and
smooth and it's funny enough. Well,

1706
01:37:06,371 --> 01:37:06,890
you know what man?

1707
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:10,690
I mean reality television has proven that
you don't really need to be that funny

1708
01:37:10,691 --> 01:37:13,510
to get people to watch it. Yeah. You
just need to, people people need,

1709
01:37:13,511 --> 01:37:16,300
it needs to come a part of their
everyday existence. They get like,

1710
01:37:16,301 --> 01:37:18,340
let's see what's going on.
And ice road truckers, shit.

1711
01:37:18,341 --> 01:37:22,750
The boys are on a slippery road.
Again, it becomes an ice road.

1712
01:37:22,751 --> 01:37:26,120
Truckers, there's a show about
slippery roads. Yeah, I mean,

1713
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:28,210
and if that can exist,

1714
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:31,300
you can have a show about anything and
a sitcom that's like been around for

1715
01:37:31,301 --> 01:37:33,670
awhile. It's fairly decent. It's
got a few good laughs in it,

1716
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:38,590
but I bet for Charlie Sheen it's like
he's smoking coke and banging horse and

1717
01:37:38,591 --> 01:37:41,530
then he's going and doing this
super bland television show.

1718
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,900
I bet that built up inside of him.

1719
01:37:43,901 --> 01:37:47,080
I bet that like made him
go more over the edge.

1720
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:51,190
His character was pretty much himself
though in the, in that show. I mean,

1721
01:37:51,191 --> 01:37:52,420
it might've been a vanilla.
She'll be,

1722
01:37:52,421 --> 01:37:55,980
he still was a drunk guy that just
fucked a bunch of chicks. I mean, it

1723
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:00,000
was like, it wasn't, he wasn't really off
his wrote a little sure. No, no, no. Sure.

1724
01:38:00,001 --> 01:38:02,810
It was, what can he acts like? Oh yeah,

1725
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:05,310
you're gonna see Petunia
Wall Street trolley.

1726
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:06,660
She didn't get out of his fucking ass off.

1727
01:38:06,770 --> 01:38:10,830
I didn't see Charlie Sheen back
motherfucker when he was young man.

1728
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:15,030
Does he? Yeah. He's at
the office and he's like,

1729
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:19,240
he's like the really hot guy that's in
trouble and the girls there with them,

1730
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:23,000
she's original nose and she's
all excited about them. Yeah.

1731
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,870
What was the movie that Charlie could
have kept that knows, right? Yeah.

1732
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:28,350
There wasn't a bad,
it's just that's your nose hooker.

1733
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:31,160
What was the movie that Charlie
Sheen shots. He was in scary.

1734
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:32,890
You might do three or four.
Yeah.

1735
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:37,500
What was the move that he tried to play
a played himself, but it played like him,

1736
01:38:37,501 --> 01:38:41,040
like he was friends with
the main character. Anything
get a John Malcovich. Yes.

1737
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:43,350
John Malcovich.
That was an awesome

1738
01:38:43,570 --> 01:38:48,100
a cameo with him in it. Do you remember
that? No. Badly. As far as I can tell,

1739
01:38:48,101 --> 01:38:51,770
it closes itself, I think. Yeah, I
dunno. Charlie Sheen, you see platoon,

1740
01:38:51,790 --> 01:38:54,180
he's about him on the phone.
She Wall Street.

1741
01:38:56,410 --> 01:38:58,740
All fucking good. You know
what holds up dude? What?

1742
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:01,420
Silence of the lambs holds the fucker.
Yeah,

1743
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:04,810
I watched silence of the lambs Hila night.
It's a good goddamn movie still.

1744
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:08,690
It's still holds up in the basket.
Yeah, it's good man. It's, it's,

1745
01:39:08,691 --> 01:39:12,220
it's well written. It's
well do girl. Dude.

1746
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:16,570
Fucking Anthony Hopkins was a bad
mother fucker in that movie still.

1747
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:20,230
You know, he's become like this guy
who does like these movies. It's sock.

1748
01:39:20,231 --> 01:39:24,540
You played the Wolf Man, Dad. You know
what I mean? The wolf man. Dad Demon

1749
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:27,950
in every movie. You didn't
see the wolf man? No,

1750
01:39:28,130 --> 01:39:30,180
but there's also in Super Mario brothers.
It wasn't,

1751
01:39:30,181 --> 01:39:31,910
he was in something
fucking retarded like that.

1752
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:37,470
Even in the wolf man, which is a terrible
movie. He's still like, has these scenes,

1753
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:40,710
these moments where he's just
this bad motherfucker. He just,

1754
01:39:40,711 --> 01:39:42,300
he just doing crappy ass movies,

1755
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:45,810
but you go back to silence of the lambs
and you realize what he's capable of.

1756
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:48,180
If he gets a good script,
if he gets a good part,

1757
01:39:48,390 --> 01:39:53,390
Anthony Hopkins just smashes it out of
the ball half that Mu fucking smashes it.

1758
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:59,040
Dude. He's so on like it crackles like
it makes you nervous for her while she's

1759
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:03,240
talking to him like you fucking believe
a 100% that dude has murdered in his

1760
01:40:03,241 --> 01:40:07,710
mind when he's talking and he's talking
to Anthony Hopkins is thinking about

1761
01:40:07,711 --> 01:40:09,700
eating her.
He's thinking about cutting up.

1762
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:14,640
He's allowing himself to go to some
crazy dark place where he's acting,

1763
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:18,000
where you could tell like, that's really
what he's fucking thinking about, man.

1764
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:22,680
He could turn it on. He can go
to that dark, crazy, psychotic,

1765
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:26,190
worst case scenario, human example.
He can go there and his mind.

1766
01:40:26,490 --> 01:40:30,010
That's the difference, man. It's just
like comedy, man. It's like you, you,

1767
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:33,120
you have to really be fucking
thinking about what you're saying.

1768
01:40:33,330 --> 01:40:36,960
There's not just the words and the noises
that represents certain things to me.

1769
01:40:37,110 --> 01:40:40,170
I got to know that you're thinking about
these things as you're saying them,

1770
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:40,901
you know,

1771
01:40:40,901 --> 01:40:44,310
and that's the difference between a great
performance and a performance that's

1772
01:40:44,311 --> 01:40:47,250
just kind of mediocre and
can trick dummies. You know,

1773
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:48,990
if someone's really nailing it.

1774
01:40:49,180 --> 01:40:52,180
I told her 22 year old actor
that just got here from La.

1775
01:40:52,181 --> 01:40:54,070
I was like acting as
pretending like you don't

1776
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,090
know what you're going to say next.

1777
01:40:55,091 --> 01:40:57,550
And he got so offended and he
ended up moving back to Tennessee.

1778
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,550
You can't take the heat, stay out
of the kitchen, bitch. Listen,

1779
01:41:02,730 --> 01:41:06,440
if that's all that set, this
fucking kid off. I bit on porn,

1780
01:41:06,441 --> 01:41:07,980
start telling them that acting is fake.

1781
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,520
I've always said that if you can lie,

1782
01:41:11,521 --> 01:41:13,560
you can act and if you could
lie to a crazy girlfriend,

1783
01:41:13,561 --> 01:41:17,520
you can act under pressure. It's
not that hard. It's just pretending.

1784
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:21,200
The hard thing is auditions.
Auditions are way harder because you're,

1785
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:24,150
you have to pretend that it's happening
when you're in this really unrealistic

1786
01:41:24,151 --> 01:41:28,080
scenario. You're sitting in his office
and there's people in desks, chairs,

1787
01:41:28,081 --> 01:41:29,700
and they're facing you
with paper in their hand.

1788
01:41:29,701 --> 01:41:32,460
They're reading off the paper and you're
responding like it's really like this

1789
01:41:32,461 --> 01:41:35,910
is just, I'm good that you like, this
is just too strange. It just doesn't,

1790
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:36,990
it doesn't ring real to me.

1791
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,570
I don't really do well on
those types of scenarios.

1792
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:42,100
Have you done any three d
movies for real? Yep. Yeah,

1793
01:41:42,101 --> 01:41:45,150
I just did three powerhouse
movies. And how did they, do they,

1794
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:47,430
how do they differ from
like doing regular moves?

1795
01:41:47,431 --> 01:41:48,690
Do they make you do weird angles?

1796
01:41:48,691 --> 01:41:52,250
Like you have to spread your lips out
towards the cameras or something disrobe

1797
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:52,921
or something.

1798
01:41:52,921 --> 01:41:57,330
You have like sort of throw your clothes
toward the camera or kind of like put

1799
01:41:57,331 --> 01:42:01,500
like one leg off the bed, like cut and
tangling toward the camera or something.

1800
01:42:01,501 --> 01:42:02,334
So what about

1801
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:06,720
guy shoot loads? Do they shoot them at the
camera? I don't, I don't really notice.

1802
01:42:06,721 --> 01:42:11,340
I'm like kind of like in the zone. The
building, we'd have a pillow behind you.

1803
01:42:11,341 --> 01:42:12,750
You don't want to smash
your head on the headboard

1804
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:17,850
to be like eight feet away for, for
the three d effect to work. Right.

1805
01:42:17,870 --> 01:42:22,340
So you gotta you gotta like clearly
you've never seen very far away. Hmm.

1806
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:25,520
Never seen the distance very,
very far. What about some do,

1807
01:42:25,521 --> 01:42:27,970
what did some dude's eat like Peter
North and what does that guy eat?

1808
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:31,990
So much sperm. So ridiculous
supplements. Is that what it is?

1809
01:42:31,991 --> 01:42:36,991
Zinc and I remember my boyfriend told me
also PC exercises like the muscle that

1810
01:42:37,931 --> 01:42:41,410
you use, like Stop Your pee. Oh
right. You know like, like a key goal.

1811
01:42:41,411 --> 01:42:44,140
Like a woman has a keigo muscle,
like the PC muscles.

1812
01:42:44,141 --> 01:42:48,130
What guys have I guess and
apparently if you just do that a lot,

1813
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:51,580
it can strengthen the muscle
and you'll shoot further. Yeah,

1814
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:56,190
that's in it right now. Practice it. Some
people just drink egg white egg whites.

1815
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:58,960
Yeah. It looks like loads.
Loads will come out more

1816
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:05,010
type shit. Yeah. Yeah. That's
probably the logical man.

1817
01:43:05,011 --> 01:43:09,390
It's probably some placebo effect. Right?
It's like the secret but with loads, yes.

1818
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:13,980
Secretly did it on your vision board
you believe hello the longest load ever.

1819
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:16,410
What do you think is the furthest
anyone's ever shoot a load?

1820
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:21,390
Because I remember hitting hit myself
in the face once when I was 16 and being

1821
01:43:21,391 --> 01:43:25,680
shocked that it's shut off and I pulled
out and you know my, my high was down.

1822
01:43:25,681 --> 01:43:28,740
I was looking at it last me
right in the face. Don't do that.

1823
01:43:28,770 --> 01:43:30,060
I make it rain all the time.

1824
01:43:30,061 --> 01:43:33,900
Like I fucking why is this squirting on
my forehead out of nowhere really far.

1825
01:43:33,901 --> 01:43:36,630
Like what's the furthest
anybody's ever shot a load?

1826
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:40,680
Spiderman was the furthest is
even five feet. I would be more,

1827
01:43:40,681 --> 01:43:43,540
I would say so I to be able to arc?
No,

1828
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:48,000
it depends on like if there's a
headwind how long your Dick is.

1829
01:43:48,001 --> 01:43:49,170
Cause he guy like you know,

1830
01:43:49,171 --> 01:43:52,980
some giant Dick John Holmes type
would have a massive advantage. Yeah.

1831
01:43:52,990 --> 01:43:54,410
He's got a six inch reach advantage.

1832
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:59,470
It's like John Jones as long arms loses
some pressure going through with that

1833
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:03,220
launch mood. I like the way you're
thinking scientifically. Yeah. I like

1834
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:05,720
but maybe a shorter barrel

1835
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:07,850
you got it makes sense.
Right?

1836
01:44:07,851 --> 01:44:11,120
Like a 38 special but it seems like a
rifle would be much more accurate. Right?

1837
01:44:11,150 --> 01:44:13,750
Yeah. Here's a little tip, by the way, if
you put it a little bit of green again,

1838
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:18,530
just the bumps out with like Saint
Patty's Day, you know Saint Patty's Day,

1839
01:44:18,531 --> 01:44:21,320
this is awesome. St Patty's, they put
a little bit of green of food coloring,

1840
01:44:21,321 --> 01:44:24,290
render dick before you have stacks. And
when you shoot out it actually is green.

1841
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:24,981
Yeah,
that's good.

1842
01:44:24,981 --> 01:44:28,970
And what if you make a baby and it's
fucking looks like the Hawk baby cause I

1843
01:44:28,980 --> 01:44:31,070
could asshole.
What have you ruined the baby?

1844
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:35,660
What if it gets to the SPERMATOZOA and
the spermatozoa get some crazy green

1845
01:44:35,661 --> 01:44:38,720
signal and shoots it into the egg
and some under the kid becomes great.

1846
01:44:38,730 --> 01:44:41,990
How would be fucking awesome? I wonder
if it's ever happened before. I mean,

1847
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:43,220
I mean if any,
not that,

1848
01:44:43,221 --> 01:44:46,250
but I mean if anybody's ever like done
something where like the kid came out of

1849
01:44:46,251 --> 01:44:48,400
funky color because of that. Yeah. Hmm.

1850
01:44:49,530 --> 01:44:53,400
The fear that people will probably been
tricked to think that like maybe a white

1851
01:44:53,401 --> 01:44:55,320
woman having a half black baby

1852
01:44:56,790 --> 01:45:01,110
recessive gene back in
the old days. Right.

1853
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:03,000
That's the story of Jesus.
Right?

1854
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:06,240
I mean the story of Jesus most
likely is it marries a whore, right?

1855
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:10,040
That's the story of Jesus, right?
Immaculate consumption. Right?

1856
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:13,380
It's come on bitch. Yeah. What
kind of crazy shit is this?

1857
01:45:13,530 --> 01:45:15,750
But back then in the biblical days,
you just had to accept it.

1858
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:20,870
Maybe she was raped by one of those
strong men. Maybe she'll want to rape her.

1859
01:45:20,950 --> 01:45:23,610
She asked you dressing
like that fucking robes.

1860
01:45:23,611 --> 01:45:27,510
I see you wrote it,
but she got a dirty ass too,

1861
01:45:27,570 --> 01:45:30,480
and back then the only lived to be like
30 days. You got to get your rapings in.

1862
01:45:30,481 --> 01:45:35,250
Why you could, oh my gosh, this
is horrible. You guys listen,

1863
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:39,900
you had an electric charge inside
your asshole. This is horrible. Oh,

1864
01:45:39,901 --> 01:45:41,880
it's very so as this conversation,
yeah,

1865
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:44,660
we've all agreed to be here and so
these people who have agreed to today,

1866
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:47,760
I don't know,
2,360 of them right now are regretting it.

1867
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,560
Oh,
you guys

1868
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:52,350
cool. No, that's cool.
That's a lot of people.

1869
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:54,270
It's actually going to be
a lot more than that one.

1870
01:45:54,610 --> 01:45:56,430
She wanted to hold thing
watching this right now.

1871
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:57,660
You've done other podcasts before,
right?

1872
01:45:57,661 --> 01:46:00,150
You've done some do you
do Marin's to death squad

1873
01:46:00,430 --> 01:46:03,250
Marin?
I just did a the Nerdist podcast.

1874
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:05,620
Oh, see you're, that's
what's fascinating about you.

1875
01:46:05,621 --> 01:46:08,140
It's like as far as like girls
that are in your business,

1876
01:46:08,141 --> 01:46:11,200
you're much more known for your
personality than any of the other ones.

1877
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:14,140
And I think a lot of it is
those videos that you do,

1878
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:17,860
you know where you break the Adam Sandler
video, you're breaking things down.

1879
01:46:17,861 --> 01:46:19,750
Yeah.
Like what else did you have a mail bag?

1880
01:46:19,751 --> 01:46:21,870
We read people's emails or
respond to them. I space

1881
01:46:21,870 --> 01:46:25,470
when I, when my space was before
it was like just a spam graveyard.

1882
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:30,680
I would get like this really super
heinous hate mail that was so just so many

1883
01:46:32,251 --> 01:46:37,251
different levels of wrong and rude and
misspelled and English and English.

1884
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:37,680
Yeah.

1885
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:42,390
Just like really mean like I have you
get fucking cancer in your brain and dive

1886
01:46:42,391 --> 01:46:46,650
aids cause you're a whore and you
should accept Jesus in your life.

1887
01:46:46,651 --> 01:46:50,130
And it was like, that makes
no sense, right? Jesus Christ

1888
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:54,060
would not fucking waste his time
to wish me dead of AIDS and cancer.

1889
01:46:55,110 --> 01:46:58,020
Like
try to help you out.

1890
01:46:58,021 --> 01:47:02,730
You Fuck Jesus Christ.
Ignorance as well.

1891
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:05,910
There's a lot of that out there. You
know when you're allowed to be anonymous.

1892
01:47:05,911 --> 01:47:07,830
It's a very unknown,
normal situation.

1893
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:12,060
It's an unnatural situation in human
behavior. We're supposed to like we, we,

1894
01:47:12,070 --> 01:47:16,110
we get rewards and we get pleasure and
we get all this from interacting with

1895
01:47:16,111 --> 01:47:16,620
each other.

1896
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:19,200
But when you're interacting with each
other completely anonymously through like

1897
01:47:19,201 --> 01:47:21,370
wires and it's all ones and zeroes,

1898
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:26,910
dude, I get it all day. Get
it every day on Twitter.

1899
01:47:26,911 --> 01:47:30,150
It was always some douchey due to so
something and I'm just block them like I'm

1900
01:47:30,151 --> 01:47:31,080
not,
I don't have time.

1901
01:47:31,081 --> 01:47:36,081
I'm not gonna argue with you so we
can't spare followers and have 237,000

1902
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:41,760
something that I would rather have
one that falls me. That's nice.

1903
01:47:42,030 --> 01:47:46,200
Let's say 280 million people want it to
be cons. I would stop being on Twitter.

1904
01:47:46,230 --> 01:47:50,100
You know? It's fun though.
The, the cool people way, way,

1905
01:47:50,101 --> 01:47:54,380
way outnumber the shitheads. Yeah. And
like you get like really cool interacting.

1906
01:47:54,381 --> 01:47:58,130
Like last night I wrote on Twitter that
that Charlie sheen was reminded me of

1907
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:58,741
hunters Thompson,

1908
01:47:58,741 --> 01:48:02,100
the way he's talking and I said we were
right outside of Barstow and the drugs

1909
01:48:02,101 --> 01:48:06,750
began to take hold and then I got like
hundreds and hundreds of tweets of people

1910
01:48:06,751 --> 01:48:10,390
quoting hunters Thompson lines from
the book. It was fucking great.

1911
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:12,630
It was really good.
Let's get down to brass tax,

1912
01:48:12,631 --> 01:48:15,420
how much for the ape and they just kid
just kept coming over and over again.

1913
01:48:15,421 --> 01:48:17,280
I'm like,
this is fucking awesome.

1914
01:48:17,281 --> 01:48:21,210
Like this is like a really interesting
thing to interact with like minded people.

1915
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:27,060
I have a message board and I want you
to be a part of it because you would fit

1916
01:48:27,061 --> 01:48:28,350
in like a fucking love.

1917
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:32,990
It's a great message board and it's all
psychos and Weirdos and your moderator

1918
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,660
board. It's on Joe Rogan. Dot.
Now we'll make you a rock.

1919
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:36,810
I'll make you a moderator for sure.
We need more women.

1920
01:48:36,811 --> 01:48:38,310
We only have like a couple
of women moderators.

1921
01:48:38,590 --> 01:48:41,250
I've got to make sure that you
can, you can handle it. At first,

1922
01:48:41,950 --> 01:48:45,090
you can't snap and go crazy. Yeah.
You can't get a mortgage to people.

1923
01:48:45,091 --> 01:48:46,770
It's not worth it.
But when people are Douche bags,

1924
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:50,190
I send them to the retard room.
I have two rooms I have like,

1925
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:53,490
well one is like the main,
the main forum you can go to.

1926
01:48:53,491 --> 01:48:57,280
There's a combat sports for flick MMA
stuff. And then there's a, um, uh,

1927
01:48:57,290 --> 01:49:01,050
a regular forum and then there's a
podcast form and then there's special ed.

1928
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:04,570
And Special Ed is if you're a douchebag,
if you act like a shithead,

1929
01:49:05,710 --> 01:49:09,780
you're stupid. Yeah. You want to insult
people all the time for no reason.

1930
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:12,990
Get in the fucking toward been
dummy. Yeah. But because of that,

1931
01:49:12,991 --> 01:49:16,920
we've established a pattern and accepted
like levels of communication and

1932
01:49:16,921 --> 01:49:21,240
everybody's really cool there. It's
a fascinating fucking shit. Yeah.

1933
01:49:21,241 --> 01:49:23,970
And fascinating fucking shit
comes out of there. You know,

1934
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:25,080
there's so many interesting,

1935
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:28,770
there's this story that I read on there
the other day about these new fun guy

1936
01:49:28,771 --> 01:49:32,730
that they found in the Amazon rain
forest that turns ants into zombies,

1937
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:37,810
takes over the ant's brain. Horrible.
Anyway. Well that's why they're there.

1938
01:49:37,811 --> 01:49:40,110
They're there to to keep
the amp population of bay.

1939
01:49:40,111 --> 01:49:45,111
This fungus grows inside of dance
body wires right out of its head,

1940
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:48,020
grows out of its head after it's dead was

1941
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:52,750
a amp juice out of it.
It also causes other ants to cannibalize.

1942
01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:54,590
They cannibalize each other and the,

1943
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:58,030
there's four different types of them and
then when one bullet ant will find that

1944
01:49:58,031 --> 01:49:59,590
this fungus has infected,

1945
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:03,400
they will have their own way and take a
deep into the woods. Even in the jungle.

1946
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:05,260
No, it's like they, they
know what the fuck does.

1947
01:50:05,261 --> 01:50:09,390
A fascinating shit on life narrated
by Oprah Winfrey. Really. I think the,

1948
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:13,580
I think that was, it was like the
generic version of planet earth. Okay.

1949
01:50:14,430 --> 01:50:16,470
Badass bitch.
I was watching,

1950
01:50:16,471 --> 01:50:19,940
I watched the Oprah
network fascinating to me.

1951
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:21,820
I watched it the other day.
Yeah.

1952
01:50:21,821 --> 01:50:23,640
I got a TV in my gym and I
was working out in the gym.

1953
01:50:23,641 --> 01:50:26,820
I was on the window and I was watching
the Oprah network and I was watching her.

1954
01:50:26,821 --> 01:50:27,654
She was just that.

1955
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:31,620
She was considering whether or not you
should have Nadia [inaudible] on our show,

1956
01:50:31,770 --> 01:50:35,070
whether they should help her and they
decided to get someone to come on and help

1957
01:50:35,071 --> 01:50:38,610
her financially help her answer.
Interesting. No, it's interesting.

1958
01:50:38,650 --> 01:50:42,900
Elixia into Oprah like how she talks and
how she thinks like you get behind that

1959
01:50:42,901 --> 01:50:44,100
woman like she's like,

1960
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:48,870
she really is all about reaching out and
helping people be the best person they

1961
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:52,230
they they can be and love. Like that's
really what she's into it, right?

1962
01:50:52,231 --> 01:50:55,230
Like it's so easy to criticize her.
It's so like the Cliche,

1963
01:50:55,231 --> 01:50:57,570
she's on TV all the time, you know? She's,

1964
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:01,140
it's like she's an easy target but
when you look at like what she does,

1965
01:51:01,141 --> 01:51:04,350
like she is bad mother fucker. Yeah, sure.

1966
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:05,410
Oprah is like,

1967
01:51:06,110 --> 01:51:09,800
everyone would hate the shit out of her
if she was like with the amount of money

1968
01:51:09,801 --> 01:51:13,130
that she has, if she was, if she was
like being like Charlie Sheen is,

1969
01:51:13,131 --> 01:51:17,010
people would be like fuck you,
you black bench.

1970
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:21,590
I got this bitch life. Imagine if she
was talking about that rock star. Like,

1971
01:51:22,010 --> 01:51:24,080
I'm like a freaking rock star from Mars

1972
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:29,900
with my friends. If anybody's a
rock star from Mars, it's Oprah.

1973
01:51:30,170 --> 01:51:30,711
You know what I mean?

1974
01:51:30,711 --> 01:51:34,480
She has some man that's just like in
the shadows and shuts his whole that God

1975
01:51:34,481 --> 01:51:38,000
isn't even talking less spoken to
Steadman sits around and waits.

1976
01:51:38,001 --> 01:51:42,050
He waits three paces behind her and he
doesn't say shit unless she asks him a

1977
01:51:42,051 --> 01:51:46,660
question. I bet Oprah has a
very big area anymore. Yeah.

1978
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:51,020
I don't think they are. Kale
finally forced it out. Yeah,
I think that full Gail.

1979
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:54,520
That's the, that's the rumor, right?
That's what's up. That's cool. I mean the,

1980
01:51:54,521 --> 01:51:57,950
the Odin station has like
a bunch of gay friendly,

1981
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:00,000
they had a great show the other day.

1982
01:52:00,090 --> 01:52:04,130
I was on the Oprah network and it
was all about transsexuals. Yeah.

1983
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:06,960
It was a very eye opening
man to look into it.

1984
01:52:06,961 --> 01:52:11,510
Cause I have a friend whose son
is, uh, becoming a transsexual. Um,

1985
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:14,490
his son is about to change
from Amanda to a woman.

1986
01:52:14,491 --> 01:52:18,120
And it's really strange because it sounds
about the change for a man to a woman

1987
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:22,910
and his son is like into girl still,
so sun is like becoming a lesbian.

1988
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,650
Very, very bizarre. And
he's going to go apparently,

1989
01:52:25,651 --> 01:52:26,890
I don't know if he's going
to go through the operator,

1990
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:28,790
I don't know what the
entire full story is,

1991
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:33,060
but they had this whole show dedicated
to it and they had some kids,

1992
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:36,420
I mean there was a boy that
was like a little boy. Okay.

1993
01:52:36,421 --> 01:52:39,840
He looked like he was like seven or eight
years old and he was wearing a dress

1994
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:42,660
and he wanted to be a girl
know and I'm like, whoa. Like

1995
01:52:43,130 --> 01:52:46,040
does the younger you start,
the more convincing you be if you

1996
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,260
just avoid going through the
whole male puberty thing,

1997
01:52:48,261 --> 01:52:52,070
you stand a chance of being a more
convincing women after your transition.

1998
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:55,730
Yeah, maybe. I mean if you can really be
sure of your choice at that young an age,

1999
01:52:55,731 --> 01:52:56,564
but it's God,

2000
01:52:56,630 --> 01:52:59,750
you talked to the parents and it's like
very convincing what they're saying.

2001
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:02,870
It's not like it's so easy.
If you're a normal gender oriented,

2002
01:53:05,140 --> 01:53:09,410
you're like seven years old and you're
like, I'm challenged, I'm transgender.

2003
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:11,760
It's not a phase.
It's not a fucking,

2004
01:53:12,670 --> 01:53:13,091
I agree with you,

2005
01:53:13,091 --> 01:53:17,110
but who knows if it's a part of what's
going on as you're young and then as your

2006
01:53:17,111 --> 01:53:20,860
hormones kick in as you become 18 and
19 maybe. See, no, I'm just a gay man.

2007
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:22,810
You know? Maybe. Maybe
it's like that simple.

2008
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:25,510
Maybe like you have transitioned
straight man. Right.

2009
01:53:25,511 --> 01:53:27,940
What I'm saying is I don't,

2010
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:31,300
I don't think you should
really necessarily be fucking
with your hormones until

2011
01:53:31,301 --> 01:53:34,840
they settle in. I mean, I can understand
someone being a grown adult and saying,

2012
01:53:34,870 --> 01:53:38,320
okay, I want to be a woman.
I've faked this long too long.

2013
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:40,480
This is what I want to do.
But when you're a child, shit,

2014
01:53:40,481 --> 01:53:42,800
I don't even know what the
fuck I was gonna I mean, God,

2015
01:53:42,910 --> 01:53:43,910
could you imagine if you had a chance,

2016
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:48,440
you know, like that's probably normal
for straight dudes. You know, what,

2017
01:53:49,370 --> 01:53:51,590
if I turned out to be like a
completely straight person,

2018
01:53:51,591 --> 01:53:55,670
I probably wouldn't have been like lusting
over nudie magazines and like showing

2019
01:53:55,671 --> 01:53:59,660
them to people and being like thank you
have to cut a little gay change like a

2020
01:53:59,661 --> 01:54:02,360
little gay gay girl.
When you were talking about

2021
01:54:02,410 --> 01:54:04,770
children, I think you have to
account for change, you know,

2022
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:07,200
I'm not saying you should
completely dis this, you know,

2023
01:54:07,270 --> 01:54:10,360
just credit the idea that this is
really a girl trapped in a boy's body,

2024
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:13,770
but I'm saying you have to account for
changes like as far as like adding to

2025
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:16,930
their body and stuff like that.
Seems like a really radical choice.

2026
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,580
And one of these kids
was like 10 years old,

2027
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:24,050
crazy medicine and their kids and there's
like whatever, you know kitty pro.

2028
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:28,510
Right. You know, which is
another fascinating good.
It's better. I think it was,

2029
01:54:28,810 --> 01:54:30,610
would it be better if a child was like,

2030
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:34,750
I know this about myself and instead of
like some going, my kid is unreasonable.

2031
01:54:34,751 --> 01:54:38,740
Like because they let the TV babysit
it and then pump your kid full over the

2032
01:54:38,741 --> 01:54:41,700
lend because they're hyper,
they're just maybe undisciplined.

2033
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:46,120
They used to live down the street that
was riddling up their kid and it was

2034
01:54:46,121 --> 01:54:46,220
[inaudible].

2035
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:49,180
That's probably fucking your kid up more
than listening to them when they tried

2036
01:54:49,181 --> 01:54:51,290
to identify their sexuality
or their gender, right?

2037
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:54,470
The kid was on a bad kid there. The
parents were terrible. They were terrible.

2038
01:54:54,471 --> 01:54:58,220
A parenting and the kid was lost and the
kid always seemed to me like they just

2039
01:54:58,221 --> 01:55:00,290
wanted someone to tell them what was up,
give them a hug,

2040
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:01,310
tell them what was that they did.

2041
01:55:01,311 --> 01:55:04,590
There were two of the most lost kids
ever because their parents were a fucking

2042
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,070
holy wreck right here.

2043
01:55:06,071 --> 01:55:09,200
Would yell at each other in
public and it was just a disaster.

2044
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:12,020
And they started picking their kids up
and it was like I was living next door to

2045
01:55:12,021 --> 01:55:14,370
zombies. It's like looking
at us like did the Zombie,

2046
01:55:14,371 --> 01:55:16,010
but these people have
been taken over by spores,

2047
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:20,060
I mean that those pills might as well be
the fucking spores that Jack those ants.

2048
01:55:20,260 --> 01:55:21,770
Right.
The same thing it just takes,

2049
01:55:21,771 --> 01:55:25,340
so it's a chemical thing that happens to
a kid where it takes over their brain,

2050
01:55:25,341 --> 01:55:27,980
rewires it and makes them think
and behave totally differently.

2051
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:30,950
And then all of a sudden these kids were
like these little slap jobs on base.

2052
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:35,120
I was like, wow, they don neuter their
fucking kids brains. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

2053
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:39,420
it's fucking crazy. Crazy how easy
it is to have that sort of, that,

2054
01:55:39,490 --> 01:55:43,010
that sort of power to just do that to
your kids. I know to another person,

2055
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:44,040
I know his kid

2056
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:47,520
is not fucked up and he's got his kid
on some sort of riddle and shit because

2057
01:55:47,521 --> 01:55:48,390
his kids too active

2058
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:51,540
cause his kid is fucking
alive and they're older.

2059
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:54,710
They didn't have the kid until they were
like in their 50s they adopted them.

2060
01:55:55,450 --> 01:55:58,410
They can't keep up at all. So they
have this fucking can't medicate it.

2061
01:55:58,900 --> 01:56:01,420
We want to treat him to the stove,
whatever kid is nothing.

2062
01:56:01,421 --> 01:56:03,210
It's nothing wrong with this kid.
I've talked to him.

2063
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:05,010
He's just a wild little motherfucker.

2064
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:07,950
Sure. You know, and so what are they good?
They got him all pilled up. It's like,

2065
01:56:07,951 --> 01:56:11,040
all right, good luck. What
is, how many generations?

2066
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:14,460
If we had of people that were pilled
up like this though? Oh, forever. No,

2067
01:56:14,461 --> 01:56:15,294
I don't think so.

2068
01:56:15,450 --> 01:56:19,190
We're social engineering mean PROZAC
came into to mind when I was a,

2069
01:56:19,191 --> 01:56:20,410
I believe when I was
in high school as well,

2070
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:23,400
first time in the first war, that was like
institutionalizing people in the body.

2071
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:27,240
Lobotomizing people in shock. There
should be like a blue iris. Right.

2072
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:30,170
But she was never normal after that,
but it's never reached extent to,

2073
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:35,130
but the lawyers get, she had
electroshock therapy repeatedly. Oh Wow.

2074
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:36,840
Didn't know that.
Try to cure a porn.

2075
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:40,580
Yeah. A lot of people don't know who blue
irises. She's on the Howard stern show,

2076
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:43,760
like an old school porn stars and
what she did and she passed away.

2077
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:45,490
She passed away. Yeah. Yeah.

2078
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:48,170
But this is a difference between the
few people that are so completely out of

2079
01:56:48,171 --> 01:56:52,100
control that you need to
be institutionalized to
people that don't like their

2080
01:56:52,101 --> 01:56:52,880
job.

2081
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:55,940
So they give you a pill so you don't feel
like shit at the end of the day every

2082
01:56:55,940 --> 01:56:58,010
day. Because there's a lot of
people that are just doing that.

2083
01:56:58,130 --> 01:57:00,680
They're physically not healthy,
their diet sucks,

2084
01:57:00,681 --> 01:57:04,070
they don't exercise and they do a job
that sucks and they wonder why they feel

2085
01:57:04,071 --> 01:57:07,040
depressed at the end of the day. I mean,
it's real simple. You don't need Prozac.

2086
01:57:07,041 --> 01:57:09,370
You need a new fucking life. I
mean, that's what you need to do.

2087
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:12,410
You need to eat to figure out what the
fuck you really want to do and realize

2088
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:14,990
that you're only here
for x amount of years,

2089
01:57:15,170 --> 01:57:19,220
so the more time you spend not moving in
the direction of your actual interests,

2090
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:22,100
the more you're going to fucking hate
yourself. You're going to be depressed.

2091
01:57:22,101 --> 01:57:25,370
It's just natural. But they don't say
that. They give you some fucking pills.

2092
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:27,280
There's a lot of people that need those.

2093
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:33,420
Totally shutting Robin take over Charlie's
shit. That's why I joined our call. Oh,

2094
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:36,390
you want to do,
you want to be and you can totally,

2095
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:38,810
that might be something
like that wasn't water

2096
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:43,730
funny checks and you're totally invited.
Yeah.

2097
01:57:43,770 --> 01:57:45,780
If you want to be in our call at anytime,

2098
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:49,800
definitely are called is a deal is just
don't be a Douche bag. It's so simple.

2099
01:57:50,690 --> 01:57:54,510
I don't know kind of one of bags. Will
you do our little, but it's natural.

2100
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:56,400
Look at what you do. Look at how
many people are yelling at you.

2101
01:57:56,410 --> 01:57:59,310
Look at how many people point at you
and sending you shitty emails all day.

2102
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:02,190
It's national to be on the defensive
and start fucking with Jennifer Aniston.

2103
01:58:06,160 --> 01:58:11,160
I think it's so funny cause Cha Chelsea
handler was like Angelina Jolie is a

2104
01:58:11,271 --> 01:58:14,690
current because you're like with
Jennifer Aniston. Oh really? I was like,

2105
01:58:14,691 --> 01:58:17,200
Oh look at Chelsea handler's
sticking off with Jennifer instead.

2106
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:19,190
I'm like Chelsea forever.
Oh my God.

2107
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:24,170
Since the early days of a, I wrote one
of the, um, the reviews of her book,

2108
01:58:24,171 --> 01:58:28,250
her first book was a my
horizontal life. Yeah. She's a,

2109
01:58:28,310 --> 01:58:32,270
I'd love party girls. To me. I think the
party, it takes every kind of people.

2110
01:58:32,271 --> 01:58:35,810
If this is on,
can the people do,

2111
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:37,820
when are you going to
get her on the podcast?

2112
01:58:37,821 --> 01:58:39,980
We needed to get in front of way too busy.
I wouldn't even ask her.

2113
01:58:39,981 --> 01:58:42,070
She's got a sitcom going on.
She's got some sort

2114
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:45,100
of a reality show going on about her
show and then she's got her show.

2115
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:46,233
She's way too,

2116
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:52,370
it's already a show show,
but she's got a show.

2117
01:58:53,630 --> 01:58:55,490
I mean that's what it
is. Why not? Fuck it.

2118
01:58:55,491 --> 01:58:58,430
She's got an interesting people behind
the scenes. She wants to showcases it,

2119
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:00,920
including our friend I
really good friend Eva.

2120
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:06,130
She's on that show from Denver. He used
to work [inaudible] assistant. I thought,

2121
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:06,610
Oh yeah,

2122
01:59:06,610 --> 01:59:09,130
he was the best. I love that check.
I haven't talked to her forever.

2123
01:59:09,131 --> 01:59:12,130
She was this really cool trick that
worked for the Denver comedy works,

2124
01:59:12,250 --> 01:59:14,170
just super on the ball and super friendly.

2125
01:59:14,171 --> 01:59:17,620
She used to take us to media like one of
the nicest people ever and then became

2126
01:59:17,621 --> 01:59:20,050
friends with Chelsea and
she was just such a diamond.

2127
01:59:20,190 --> 01:59:21,460
It was just waiting for someone to come.

2128
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:24,080
Malonga Scoop Robert.
Like I told her like if she moved to La,

2129
01:59:24,081 --> 01:59:26,630
I would give her a job as an assistant.
I'm like, you're the coolest chick ever.

2130
01:59:27,290 --> 01:59:29,690
I've never even thought about having
an assistant because it seems so

2131
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:32,390
preposterous that you really,
you can't wait. What the fuck?

2132
01:59:32,391 --> 01:59:34,880
You got a business manager. You
also need the assessment. You could,

2133
01:59:34,881 --> 01:59:37,910
you'll get me a latte. You get Outta
here. That's ridiculous it for her.

2134
01:59:37,911 --> 01:59:42,590
I would do it. Just the two year old.
Get Your Latte, watch what happens.

2135
01:59:43,450 --> 01:59:48,380
Come back screaming and covered in burns.
Two year olds,

2136
01:59:49,610 --> 01:59:53,780
load, dishwasher. Sure.

2137
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:58,730
Mow the lawn. Have Fun. You know,

2138
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:03,030
get 'em a riding mower. Right. My
brother loved that when we were a kid.

2139
02:00:05,810 --> 02:00:09,320
My parents bought me this thing so I
could mow the law. I could ride at,

2140
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:12,680
I can drive this thing. He was
so, he was actually working well.

2141
02:00:12,681 --> 02:00:14,510
We love done mowing the lawn.

2142
02:00:14,540 --> 02:00:19,040
There's an aesthetic sense of
pleasure and sense of accomplishment,

2143
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:23,180
like you've created something visually
that's pretty, it's kind of an art form.

2144
02:00:23,181 --> 02:00:28,030
I used to work for a landscaper.
Did you? I fucking hated my hardest.

2145
02:00:29,070 --> 02:00:32,740
I only worked for a landscaper for a
whole week and he let me go because I kept

2146
02:00:32,741 --> 02:00:35,800
burning too many lawns.
What I mean is that you fuck up,

2147
02:00:35,830 --> 02:00:39,730
you don't know how to new
use the lawnmower that well
and you scalped along and

2148
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:41,560
I scalped a couple of
lawns and he got mad at me.

2149
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:45,460
It was hard fucking work and what it
paid pretty decent for what it was.

2150
02:00:45,730 --> 02:00:48,790
But you worked every God Damn
Day from six 30 in the morning.

2151
02:00:48,810 --> 02:00:51,970
You showed up at work and you work till
three o'clock in the afternoon and there

2152
02:00:51,971 --> 02:00:54,190
was a gang of fucking house system Mo.

2153
02:00:54,370 --> 02:00:58,030
You had a whole route of houses and you
got to mow their lawn and chop trees

2154
02:00:58,031 --> 02:01:01,340
down. Shit, it's backbreaking fucking
war and everybody's a douchebag.

2155
02:01:01,570 --> 02:01:05,500
You working with mostly like there was
like a few guys that were kind of cool,

2156
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:07,240
but there was a lot of like,
you know,

2157
02:01:07,241 --> 02:01:10,120
there's a lot of resentment to anybody
new that was coming along that might

2158
02:01:10,121 --> 02:01:13,210
possibly take this shitty job away.
It was real weird man.

2159
02:01:14,090 --> 02:01:18,620
Terrorism, junkyard dog type of Shit.
Labors and hard man getting a job

2160
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:23,530
as a laborer in any sort of realm
construction or that's one of the most,

2161
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:26,620
the best ways to get motivated to
get your shit together as a guy.

2162
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:29,630
Get a fucking job carrying bricks
around all day and you know,

2163
02:01:29,650 --> 02:01:32,800
get a job where you realize
what work really is.

2164
02:01:32,860 --> 02:01:37,360
When you realize what it really feels
like to be exhausted for $5 an hour,

2165
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:40,010
$5 an hour, and you're
carrying bricks all day. I have

2166
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:43,310
no idea what that would be like.
Ever worse. Yeah, but it makes you,

2167
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:45,350
I think about that shit all the time.

2168
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:49,010
If I ever think about like not writing
or ever think about not working out or

2169
02:01:49,011 --> 02:01:50,270
not getting the tank
or anything like that,

2170
02:01:50,271 --> 02:01:53,490
I don't think about working on a
construction site and carrying bricks and

2171
02:01:53,491 --> 02:01:56,090
cinder blocks and bags of cement.
I'll think about a hard,

2172
02:01:56,091 --> 02:01:57,230
that wasn't like what I have to do.

2173
02:01:57,231 --> 02:02:01,430
I just gotta get up and work at something
awesome. Just get up bitch. You know,

2174
02:02:01,431 --> 02:02:04,520
it's like this is a lot harder things
you could be doing if you don't have that

2175
02:02:04,521 --> 02:02:07,220
experience though. Some fucking
terrible thing. You know,

2176
02:02:07,370 --> 02:02:11,180
like for you when you were done with
all the electrocution is up the asshole

2177
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:13,610
like going to regular porn, it
must've been like, God damn,

2178
02:02:13,611 --> 02:02:15,730
this is a cakewalk I'll have
to do is blow some money.

2179
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:16,940
Well yeah,

2180
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:21,770
no actually there's a little bit of a
transition that's happening in porn right

2181
02:02:21,771 --> 02:02:24,620
now where uh,
they're kind of going away from that.

2182
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:29,920
Like my blonde wife is getting fucked
by six black guys to like more of,

2183
02:02:29,961 --> 02:02:34,050
wait a minute, why are they
stopping as well? That's been
phased out now. Like man,

2184
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:38,420
a cheeseburger at a, at a
taste. They're making parodies.

2185
02:02:38,450 --> 02:02:42,380
They're making romance movies that
are like Romance, Romance, novel,

2186
02:02:42,381 --> 02:02:46,640
like Romcom type of, how many
vampire points are there? A lot.

2187
02:02:47,210 --> 02:02:50,090
They did true blood
parody at new sensations.

2188
02:02:50,330 --> 02:02:53,860
I mean the twilight parody they made,
I dunno,

2189
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:55,820
they made a parody of
absolutely everything.

2190
02:02:56,070 --> 02:02:59,970
Yeah. Some dude on my message board
as an Avatar parody and it's a girl.

2191
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,040
She's got the Avatar of face and
she's getting her mouth fucked. Yeah,

2192
02:03:03,150 --> 02:03:05,320
and that's his, his, his avatar. Yeah.

2193
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:08,580
They're going to do a new avatar is going
to be underwater. You heard about that?

2194
02:03:08,581 --> 02:03:09,414
Should I lately?

2195
02:03:10,020 --> 02:03:13,440
Have you seen the preview for this new
movie where it's a bunch of chicks with

2196
02:03:13,441 --> 02:03:17,610
guns on the poster? Sucker
Punch? Yeah. Yeah. What the fuck?

2197
02:03:17,611 --> 02:03:21,290
I haven't seen the preview it, but those
posters look amazing. Watchmen. Ish. Yeah,

2198
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:25,360
same director. It looks
complete fantasy, you know,

2199
02:03:25,450 --> 02:03:28,390
crazy comic book type.
I liked that man meets,

2200
02:03:28,410 --> 02:03:31,380
you don't need to be a movie to be
realistic. Like when people go like,

2201
02:03:31,381 --> 02:03:33,930
why do you like like fantasy movies
and monster movies with my kids.

2202
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:35,520
That's what I want to be entertained.

2203
02:03:35,670 --> 02:03:38,970
I don't want you to depress me with some
real story about a girl's parents get

2204
02:03:38,971 --> 02:03:43,380
killed in a car crash. Like stop.
Stop pissing on my parade, Dude.

2205
02:03:43,470 --> 02:03:47,100
Show me some monsters and some lasers
and some spaceships and aliens.

2206
02:03:47,130 --> 02:03:50,270
Did you ever see Scott Pilgrim?
Did you ever end up? No, I
haven't seen it yet, man.

2207
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:53,940
Did you see it? Yeah, I rewatched that
the other day. Fucking loved it again.

2208
02:03:53,970 --> 02:03:56,480
That is just a fun fucking movie.
Really.

2209
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:58,350
I don't know if you would like it though.
I don't know if you would like it,

2210
02:03:58,351 --> 02:03:59,820
but I was like,

2211
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:04,320
they don't even like each other movie
recently that you liked it. I didn't like,

2212
02:04:04,380 --> 02:04:08,610
can you even think of
one? Uh Oh ma'am. No,

2213
02:04:08,611 --> 02:04:11,680
I didn't really love enter the void. But
yeah, I wasn't in the end of the void,

2214
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:15,270
but that's also because I've actually
done DMT and I'm like this is the

2215
02:04:15,271 --> 02:04:18,680
representation of it as
soul. So simple. And it was,

2216
02:04:18,690 --> 02:04:19,950
there was a lot of
problems with that movie,

2217
02:04:19,951 --> 02:04:22,380
but I just thought it was cool
with the visual effects. Yeah.

2218
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:24,360
What I thought was cool was
the first person perspective.

2219
02:04:24,361 --> 02:04:25,830
I thought that was really
interesting. Yeah, I thought that was,

2220
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:28,440
I felt like I was really that guy,
you know, if you really got into it.

2221
02:04:28,441 --> 02:04:32,340
I mean I like seeing it through like
almost like a video game with first person

2222
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:34,570
shooter perspective. Yeah. I
thought that was kind of cool.

2223
02:04:34,571 --> 02:04:37,080
And there's parts of it I liked,
but it was just too much.

2224
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,520
I didn't see anything that was
like Oscar movies. I didn't, yeah.

2225
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:43,390
No,
I think king speeds.

2226
02:04:43,391 --> 02:04:45,740
Is that about Martin Luther King
or what the fuck is that about?

2227
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:48,260
What is it about?
It's about a dog,

2228
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:51,720
the barks and the fog named king ice.

2229
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:56,040
Where's the biggest fight card? It's
a talking dog. Maybe Brian Roberts.

2230
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:58,860
The rottweiler. Yeah. I don't know
what the fuck. It's fine. I don't care.

2231
02:04:58,861 --> 02:05:02,280
I want to see, I don't want
to see any movies. I'm waiting
for cowboys and aliens.

2232
02:05:02,580 --> 02:05:05,400
I don't want to see any movies
that are real. This, this um,

2233
02:05:05,430 --> 02:05:08,610
movie that I saw on the adjustment
bureau. Totally. Science fiction.

2234
02:05:08,611 --> 02:05:12,540
Crazy fucking man. Good, good. Give me
more on that. Give me more fake shit.

2235
02:05:12,810 --> 02:05:15,360
I don't want to see real shit.
I know this is not interesting to me.

2236
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:18,030
Like here's a relationship that
they had yet. Maybe if you want,

2237
02:05:18,031 --> 02:05:22,560
throw me some crazy godfather
type gangster period piece
where it's not today's

2238
02:05:22,561 --> 02:05:26,610
reality. So can I can get into that
kind of, it's a long time ago. Reality,

2239
02:05:26,790 --> 02:05:27,750
you know?
But I don't,

2240
02:05:27,751 --> 02:05:31,410
I'm not into any real movies where people
get depressed in real life. Like stop.

2241
02:05:31,470 --> 02:05:34,650
I don't even watch movies that
have people in them anymore.

2242
02:05:34,651 --> 02:05:37,320
I just stick to just say animation.
Yeah.

2243
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:40,020
Like in that Mega Mind Three d movie,

2244
02:05:40,021 --> 02:05:44,700
Tina Fey was like really hard as the curt
tune. Right. And it was just like, cool.

2245
02:05:44,701 --> 02:05:49,260
I can like think this girl's really
super high instead of like the sticky,

2246
02:05:49,261 --> 02:05:53,400
like I'm, I'm not hot Tina Fey.
Haha. I wear glasses. I'm not hot.

2247
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:53,850
Right.

2248
02:05:53,850 --> 02:05:57,510
First Co animated movie that I ever saw
that was an adult movie was wizards.

2249
02:05:57,540 --> 02:06:01,350
Did you ever see what it was great man.
I had it on DVD,

2250
02:06:01,351 --> 02:06:04,140
like really kind of recently.
I T I can't find it.

2251
02:06:04,141 --> 02:06:08,610
I was looking forward to my house. It's
a Ralph, what is his name? Bach Bach Ski.

2252
02:06:08,611 --> 02:06:12,210
Yeah, the guy. The guy's name. The
guy that did def dealer. Right?

2253
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:15,570
No wait. Am I thinking of
somebody else? I don't know.

2254
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:18,840
It was just really cool science fiction,

2255
02:06:18,841 --> 02:06:22,620
sort of futuristic animated
movie. You know, they don't,

2256
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:25,340
they don't do too many of those, but
they're pretty dope. When they do like,

2257
02:06:25,341 --> 02:06:28,290
do you ever see heavy metal? Oh
yeah, absolutely. It's bad ass.

2258
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:30,600
I love with that chicken.
That movie were you? Yeah.

2259
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:34,540
No. It's even funnier or awesome.
Or is the heavy metal, uh,

2260
02:06:34,541 --> 02:06:39,090
inspired a south park where they did it
did don't like pretty much heavy metal

2261
02:06:39,091 --> 02:06:42,690
style cartoon and like the whole
animation will look like that.

2262
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:44,200
Do you ever see that episode?
Fucking it?

2263
02:06:44,490 --> 02:06:46,890
No.
I need to catch up on South Park's man.

2264
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:50,130
I heard that they're going to
do a Charlie Sheen, a parody,

2265
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:54,060
which I cannot fucking wait for. Of course
they're going to, they couldn't not.

2266
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:58,510
They love making fun of people. Did
the best at it. Are you on that? No,

2267
02:06:58,511 --> 02:07:00,610
I haven't been. I think they
made fun of you on that. Maybe.

2268
02:07:00,660 --> 02:07:04,050
Maybe. No, I don't think American dad
has. If they did, I would be honored.

2269
02:07:04,051 --> 02:07:07,680
As long as they weren't too cruel. Please.
Gentle. I'm a gentle soul and a big fan,

2270
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:08,431
but what they did,

2271
02:07:08,431 --> 02:07:11,130
the Crossman Sia was the most ruthless
shit I'd ever seen in my life.

2272
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:14,760
They beat him to death with a baseball
bat and shoved frozen fish sticks in his

2273
02:07:14,761 --> 02:07:18,280
necklace. So awesome. But
they were broken down like

2274
02:07:19,380 --> 02:07:22,370
I know it can be a comedian.
That'd be funny.

2275
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:26,220
It was this the most ruthless
takedown I've ever seen.

2276
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:30,330
The Kanye was even funny to the gay
fish. Their genius man. The fucking,

2277
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:34,600
how about the Tom Cruise trapped in the
closet? Shit. Yeah. God Damn Dude. They,

2278
02:07:34,710 --> 02:07:37,450
they, they break everybody
down, but they're the past man.

2279
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:42,250
There's nothing like that.
So we all agree. Didn't win.
Didn't they get, um, didn't,

2280
02:07:42,251 --> 02:07:44,240
what the fuck's his name?
Isaac Hayes. Didn't he?

2281
02:07:44,270 --> 02:07:47,680
He was the one he used to be the
chef or is it as a case? Yeah.

2282
02:07:47,740 --> 02:07:51,530
Didn't he stop doing it when there was
some sort of a show on Scientology? Yeah.

2283
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:54,090
That is so crazy.
Isn't it fast?

2284
02:07:54,220 --> 02:07:58,440
It was okay when they made fun of
everybody else's lifestyle and religion

2285
02:07:58,790 --> 02:08:02,760
forever. He, he now he's
dead, so fuck you. I the case

2286
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:06,720
maybe. Maybe it wasn't even that
great. Dan is here. Mom surfaces.

2287
02:08:06,721 --> 02:08:10,830
At the end of the podcast,
she shows a true colors.
We're going to turn it around.

2288
02:08:10,831 --> 02:08:12,600
Dana,
we're going to put you on a positive path.

2289
02:08:12,620 --> 02:08:15,470
I'm going to be a successful
standup comedian. Ouch.

2290
02:08:15,690 --> 02:08:17,790
I'm going to be a year from now.

2291
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:21,360
We're going to be looking back at this
moment and then what? I did the podcast,

2292
02:08:21,361 --> 02:08:24,720
that's when it all fucking came together.
Yeah, you're supposed to be a comedian.

2293
02:08:24,900 --> 02:08:28,260
It doesn't let you be goddamn
invulnerable up there.

2294
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:30,990
Everything that you've done and
how you've exposed publicly,

2295
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:33,840
you should be goddamn in vulnerable
up there. You got to be a goddess.

2296
02:08:33,841 --> 02:08:38,070
You have control and dominate.
This is the d,

2297
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:41,040
the beginning.
Today we launch.

2298
02:08:42,210 --> 02:08:44,750
It's so hard to heal. Better way
to end this fucking show. Uh,

2299
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:48,210
we will be back Thursday with
a young and talented Andy.

2300
02:08:48,211 --> 02:08:51,000
Dick will join us on the podcast.
He's doing it from this studio.

2301
02:08:51,810 --> 02:08:56,490
This is Rogan is not excited about
Auntie Jackie House, so we might have to,

2302
02:08:56,491 --> 02:08:59,100
but he has been sober for like four weeks.
I don't know.

2303
02:09:00,980 --> 02:09:03,160
Oh yeah,
we'll do the thing about Andy.

2304
02:09:03,161 --> 02:09:05,640
See you just never know when you're gonna
run into it with whiskey on his breath,

2305
02:09:05,670 --> 02:09:08,980
you're like, fuck. He was at the Avn
awards. He got tossed out. Right.

2306
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,320
Was He fucked up?
I don't know.

2307
02:09:10,321 --> 02:09:15,150
I saw him and he was just like Wednesday
raw or whatever. So he was hammered.

2308
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:16,193
Oh,
that's right.

2309
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:20,220
I guess I can only assume like we were
doing some kind of a mirroring exercise.

2310
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:22,620
Andy Beck and I were doing
the exact same thing.

2311
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:24,700
He talked about it on the
Greg Fitzsimmons show.

2312
02:09:24,790 --> 02:09:29,140
He talked about it on Greg Fitzsimmons
is a serious show. Yeah. And he said,

2313
02:09:29,170 --> 02:09:29,500
you know,

2314
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:32,950
that he just got out of control and it
was like the wheels fell off at the end,

2315
02:09:32,951 --> 02:09:34,390
but it was a great time before that.

2316
02:09:34,510 --> 02:09:37,510
But then it looks so bad when
people are looking back on it. Yeah.

2317
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:38,690
One other thing,
he had a really,

2318
02:09:38,970 --> 02:09:41,040
we got to pay attention to what you're,
what you look like.

2319
02:09:41,041 --> 02:09:45,750
People know who you are, you know,
basically if people know who you are.

2320
02:09:45,870 --> 02:09:49,440
Yeah. But once you, I an addict,
you know, but I go like, am I,

2321
02:09:49,740 --> 02:09:52,080
are both my shoes on or like am I,

2322
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:55,290
have I said anything offensive
or or anything to anyone.

2323
02:09:55,291 --> 02:09:59,640
Like how am I controlling myself? Like
when you're partying? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2324
02:09:59,910 --> 02:10:04,910
I drink like five whiskey drinks and
I was wearing a gown and like I waited

2325
02:10:05,011 --> 02:10:10,011
until no one was around and I took my
dress off and the mirage or the pumps

2326
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:13,830
parking structure and I threw it in the
back of my car and went back to my own

2327
02:10:13,831 --> 02:10:18,510
hotel naked.
I like just put on whatever is in my car.

2328
02:10:18,570 --> 02:10:21,330
You carry clothes around with you and
just all the time. Yeah. You never know.

2329
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:24,400
Well we were like in Vegas, so
you know, you got shit everywhere.

2330
02:10:24,401 --> 02:10:28,530
I'd have like a baseball hat and
experts just like a where I slept.

2331
02:10:28,531 --> 02:10:32,100
I slept in a bowling alley last
night in Canoga Park. What I had,

2332
02:10:32,670 --> 02:10:34,190
but it's a long story.

2333
02:10:35,460 --> 02:10:37,220
What's Andy Dick?

2334
02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:39,420
No bye bye bye.
It was so great because I had,

2335
02:10:39,421 --> 02:10:42,120
not only did I have wore a coat
because it was cold kind of cold.

2336
02:10:42,121 --> 02:10:43,440
I had sleeping bags.

2337
02:10:43,441 --> 02:10:46,390
I had airplane pillows from
traveling so much and it was her.

2338
02:10:46,391 --> 02:10:50,820
She slept in a bowling alley parking lot
of bowling alley. What the fuck, Brian?

2339
02:10:51,190 --> 02:10:54,330
It was great. It's just
good night, huh? No, no.

2340
02:10:54,331 --> 02:10:58,650
I actually didn't even drink last night
is I think young lad. It's and love,

2341
02:10:59,180 --> 02:11:01,710
I think. No, no, no, no, no. It's not
even that. No, no. It wasn't even that.

2342
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:04,740
So it's some girl had bowling alley.

2343
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:09,150
No long story.
It's young love and a parking lot.

2344
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:11,550
That's when you,
you don't mind sleeping outside

2345
02:11:12,370 --> 02:11:14,650
when you're in love. Yeah. But

2346
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:17,650
practical when you're in love,
Dana, I'll have to tell you that.

2347
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:22,280
I'll never experience it.
I mean, they were right.

2348
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:27,660
Those motherfuckers, it was all right.
Ladies and gentlemen, this weekend,

2349
02:11:27,661 --> 02:11:31,680
Friday night and Saturday night, we were
at the comedy and Magic Club next week,

2350
02:11:31,681 --> 02:11:36,570
Friday night at Gotham in New York City.
Um, Brian also has a podcast of his own,

2351
02:11:36,571 --> 02:11:37,650
it's called the death squad.

2352
02:11:37,651 --> 02:11:40,480
You can subscribe to it on
Itunes and Dana has been on it.

2353
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:41,960
Sam Tripoli's on it all the time.
It's a,

2354
02:11:42,150 --> 02:11:46,680
a plethora of young talented comedians
and they do a bunch of different

2355
02:11:46,681 --> 02:11:48,090
podcasts,
so it's not just one.

2356
02:11:48,091 --> 02:11:51,860
And you can go on the iTunes page and
find out which they are or go to desk

2357
02:11:51,861 --> 02:11:56,550
squad.tv and just subscribe the death
squad on iTunes and it's a very highly

2358
02:11:56,551 --> 02:11:59,830
ranked now. It's like in the top
20 of iTunes comedy. So it's good.

2359
02:11:59,831 --> 02:12:03,570
It's really good too. It's
really interesting. Um, so,
uh, we'll be back on Thursday,

2360
02:12:03,571 --> 02:12:04,410
like I said with any Dick.

2361
02:12:04,411 --> 02:12:08,640
Thank you everybody for everything and
thanks for tuning in and thanks for being

2362
02:12:08,641 --> 02:12:10,860

All right, I love you. Oh,

2363
02:12:10,861 --> 02:12:13,370

and go to Joe Rogan. Dot.

2364
02:12:13,410 --> 02:12:15,210
Enter entering the code name Rogan.

2365
02:12:15,240 --> 02:12:18,330
Get yourself some discounted
jerk off material.

2366
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:19,590
Do you have a rubber fleshlight yet?

2367
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:24,370
Um, no, and I've been bringing
it up every time to with
them. Well, can I? No, no, no.

2368
02:12:25,070 --> 02:12:28,600
I'm all rejection letter from
flashlight will make this happen. Dude,

2369
02:12:28,601 --> 02:12:30,900

right crowd. Oh, okay.

2370
02:12:30,970 --> 02:12:35,420
It could be like the extra

2371
02:12:36,380 --> 02:12:40,330
