1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,130
Hi
Ron.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,540
I know.
Okay.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,230
I like to leave people in
suspense. What's up fuckers? Hey,

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,710
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is brought to you by nature box.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,420
Do you hear that?
Munchen in the background.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,660
That is the hilarious Hannibal Buress
beating some naturebox and it is yummy is

7
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:24,010
pretty. It's pretty good. I'm
not even getting paid for this.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,950
Paid Burris sour cream and onion almost.
Yeah,

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,940
I get all the gluten free ones. Then
I tried to get the healthiest version.

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,590
They have healthy up to eh kind
of sketchy, healthy but delicious.

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,820
All delicious like pretzels. You can't
really make pretzels healthy. Sorry folks.

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:43,900
That's not really possible.

13
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:47,710
It's made it a bread unless you come
up with some rice pretzels. Anyway.

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,300
Point is what they do have is delicious.
The Blueberry Almond,

15
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,290
so you've got to try that shit.
That's my favorite.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,370
My second favorite is these dark cocoa
almonds. God Damn, those are good.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,920
Woo.
Their products are all natural.

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,280
They combine a much higher quality
ingredient than a typical vending machine.

19
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:06,640
Ingredients makes them healthier.
They have a hundred snacks to choose from.

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,450
So if you're looking for something that
like if you have certain dietary needs,

21
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:13,750
like your gluten free, low
sugar content, stuff like that,

22
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:16,090
they have that too whenever possible.

23
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:19,900
They also tried to use non
GMO food as well. You know,

24
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:23,590
GMO food is a very hot topic.
You want to say you're organic and GMO.

25
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,450
No one knows what either
one of those things mean,

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,300
you know there's a lot of
genetically modified food folks.

27
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:31,480
Essentially all almost all corn you eat,

28
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:33,910
almost all wheat you eat
is genetically modified,

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,700
especially wheat because it's like
the 1950s they changed the shit.

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,560
That's why people are
so gluten intolerant.

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,660
But g m o really genetically modified
did like, you know, fucking lab.

32
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,890
That's the new shit. Yeah. You knew
you were scared. You really no food.

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,320
Joe Ran a little bit of food and a
breast just a little bit. Anyway,

34
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:54,970
no high fructose corn syrup.
No partially hydrogenated oils,

35
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:58,720
no trans fats, no artificial
sweeteners, no artificial flavors,

36
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,700
no artificial colors.
So they make their shit.

37
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:02,920
It's healthy as possible and still yummy.

38
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,300
I think it's a good balance
between, you know, eaten raw kale,

39
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:12,040
which I do a lot of,
and having these delicious cocoa almonds.

40
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,050
So anyway,
naturebox.com uh,

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,030

the podcast and uh, I enjoy them.

machines, monopoly on your mid day hunger.

47
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,420
That's obviously someone else wrote that,
not me. You can tell the difference.

48
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,210
Slacking a certain something.
Anyway,

49
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,440
naturebox.com/rogan go there.
Enjoy it.

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,010
We're also brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com that's o, n n I t,

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,020
makers of Alpha, brain tech,
new mood, all controversial,

52
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:06,970
new tropics and performance enhancing
drugs that are legal. Um, what,

53
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,610
what is Alpha brain,
if you've never heard of it before?

54
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:14,020
Alpha brain is what's called a nootropic
and Google, Google that word, and Oh,

55
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:14,854
tropic.

56
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,040
And what it is is essentially nutrients
that give your brain the building blocks

57
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,730
it needs to produce
human neurotransmitter's.

58
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,330
It's very complicated stuff obviously.
Yeah, it was actually first formulated,

59
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,231
I think Prasad,

60
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:32,620
Tim was one of the first and it was
in the 1960s they figured this out.

61
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,130
They figured out that it changes
or levels of Acetylcholine,

62
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:39,760
acetylcholine enhances
memory. For me, the big one,

63
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,180
what it does best is allows
me to pull up words like,

64
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:47,200
I feel like it allows me to form
sentences more freely. And you know,

65
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,330
there's actually been
scientific studies done on it,

66
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:53,650
both in individual ingredients and
there's recently been a clinical trial on

67
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,120
Alpha brain.
All the,

68
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,540
all the lab results are
all posted@onnit.com uh,

69
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,170
if you go to Alpha brain, the
click on that link, you can,

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,010
you can read the clinical results. We
did one study, we got positive results,

71
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:08,860
especially on a memory and a execution.

72
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,010
I have to be able to be able to
execute tasks and think about things.

73
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:15,430
And it's sort of like
what I'm saying with, with
formulating sentences like this,

74
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:19,360
there's a direct effect between how you
can formulate sentences and how much

75
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:21,730
nutrition you've had. I mean,
it just makes sense. I mean,

76
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:24,910
do you feel better when you have more
nutrition? Of course you do. Have,

77
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:26,650
you feel better.
Probably your brain feels better too.

78
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,290
That's the idea behind the Alpha brain.
Very controversial.

79
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,670
So with all controversial ingredients,
all the controversial, uh,

80
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,390
supplements that we sell it on it,
we have a 100% money back guarantee.

81
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,750
You don't have to return the pills.
The first 30 pills you buy first bottle,

82
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:43,990
you have 90 days. Try it. If you say
it sucks, you get your money back.

83
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,920
It's that simple.

84
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,910
And the idea being that we're only
selling you some shit that we know works.

85
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:52,390
There's scientific data
behind it. I use it. Aubrey,

86
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:55,810
who's my partner and CEO of on it,
he uses it.

87
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,860
A ton of athletes use it,
including Bodie Miller,

88
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:03,910
a j Hawk dudes who know
their body very well.

89
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,250
Supplements man, fuck gas branch and do
you know what I'm doing, Hannibal Burress.

90
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:13,030
I'm out there trying to, trying to
spread everything that I learned.

91
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,950
If I find interesting shit, I try to,
I try to sell it the way to do it.

92
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,150
That's it's like ethical economics anyway,
on a.com.

93
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,770
Use the Codeword Rogan save 10%
off any and all supplements, uh,

94
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,940
that does not apply to strength
and conditioning equipment.

95
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:31,390
Let's just all expensive for selling
cannonballs and shipping them through the

96
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:35,350
mail. So, uh, go there. Enjoy
Hannibal Burress is here.

97
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,000
Young Jamie Cuban music.

98
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,043
Hello.

99
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,100
Oh, you fucked up, son froze. Itunes
froze. Don't be blaming iTunes, man.

100
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,520
It's just fucking computer
for the 1990s that I have.

101
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,973
Okay.

102
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,940
The Joe Rogan experience.
When people get silly,

103
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,650
stupid shit that's on the list there.

104
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,193
Experience

105
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,970
Joe Rogan podcast.
My Name,

106
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,420
ladies and gentlemen,
what the fuck

107
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,140
rest is here, ladies and
gentlemen? What's up? I like a,

108
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:14,910
I like meeting a Jude who I,

109
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:18,020
I only know you by your comedy
actually bought your comedy.

110
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,410
I listened to it on the way home from
Irvine and laughed my ass off and then

111
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:25,310
meeting you and just within minutes
we're talking on the air. I like that.

112
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:28,150
That's the best way to do it. This
is the best way to do it. Yeah.

113
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,190
Thanks for having me. Hey, thanks
for doing it man. I'm excited. Uh,

114
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,690
that you have products and stuff.
That's good to branch out, dude.

115
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,360
It's all shit that I'm interested in.
Let's try it again.

116
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,240
I tried to keep myself interested.
I think that the,

117
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:46,290
I feel different when I get excited about
something like a new exercise or a new

118
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,720
hobby I'm trying or anything.
I get excited when I'm in,

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,070
so I try to spread that.
Yeah.

120
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,510
As much as I can because I tried to
think I want to get into other aspects of

121
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,610
businesses and that's cool that you done
stuff that, that you're interested in.

122
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,710
Because I like comedy. I talk about
this and Matt like light comedy,

123
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,380
but I understand that is fleeting.

124
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,930
So if everything in comedy with a way
for you got supplements is shit. Yeah,

125
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,080
but I don't think comedy is fleeting.
He really thinks,

126
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,710
I think it's like one of the
least fleeting, whichever leading.

127
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,460
But I'm just saying maintenance.

128
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,140
It needs maiden but then cause a in the
business like I'm talking about where

129
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:25,850
you know, stuff might be going well, but
then uh, you not work it as much anymore.

130
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,650
I got a theory about that. I think
that shits in the past. Yeah.

131
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,130
I don't think that's
going to happen anymore.

132
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,710
I think guys would go away because
they wouldn't get gigs anymore.

133
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,780
They wouldn't get television shows,
they wouldn't get all these things.

134
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,380
But now everybody promotes themselves.
They all, everybody has a Twitter account.

135
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:41,090
Everybody has a website.
Everybody,

136
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,350
when you get fans now they know where
they can find you. Yeah. It used to be,

137
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,890
if you weren't on television where,
hey, where'd he go? Where's this guy?

138
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,510
Where did he go?
It vanished.

139
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,240
You can't just go to his Facebook page
and read a blog that he wrote today.

140
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:54,770
That's fucking hilarious.
You know,

141
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:57,650
you can't go and watch a youtube clip
that he made when he was fucking around

142
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:02,160
his backyard with his dog. It's
hilarious. All that shit is new. Oh,

143
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,500
you know, I don't confident. I'm totally
100% confident. That's comforting.

144
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,750
You're going anywhere. Hannibal
Burress, but the top [inaudible].

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You've inspired me to get my tiny bottles
of lotion for hotels business going

146
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,070
because that's what I'm passionate about.

147
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,790
I'm passionate about tidy bottles of
lotion and that seems like a stable

148
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:26,300
business. People use it. I want to
get in that. Yeah, people do use it.

149
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,660
Someone's got to be selling them
that shit. Yeah, that's a good point.

150
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,501
I want to get into that.

151
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:35,180
You have some better smelling stuff that
a smell and stuff and maybe some jokes

152
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,480
on the lotion. That's a good
apple style with lotion. Oh Man.

153
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,401
Too funny though.

154
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:43,400
You don't want to do jerking off with
your lotion and cracking up. No. Yeah,

155
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:46,050
not that you don't want to be

156
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,060
in the middle of it so you
don't lose your stroke.

157
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,410
You don't want to do loses his stroke
when you go limp while jerking off. Man,

158
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,280
those are tough.
Again,

159
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,340
it up again while you jerking off what ss.
A lot of work,

160
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,000
but that's just if you focused,
if you really,

161
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:07,260
if you're really about making it to
your goal, then you just power through.

162
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,450
That's really what it is.
It seems frivolous,

163
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:14,430
but it's really just an
exercise and achieving your
goals. Fall down nine times.

164
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,480
Get up nine times.

165
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,510
Why did I say they say get up 10
what the fuck are you talking about?

166
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:24,310
It's because people fall down
and lock your brain damage. You

167
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,930
can't just fall down nine times she got
fucked up, man. Little kids fall down.

168
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:32,660
They hurts themselves. But you're a grown
man. You gotta Fall Down Nine Times.

169
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:34,530
You're not gonna break something.
Why are you falling? So what's that?

170
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:38,170
What's your balance? Are you getting
tackled or you just straight up falling?

171
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,690
You've got a bum Nissan. No ankle
week. You've got a weak foot. Yeah,

172
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,910
people got to get it together.
Fall down nine times.

173
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:48,770
Get up 10 what are you saying? How does
that even work? It does it. I don't know.

174
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:52,410
I guess get up in the morning,
getting up in the morning.

175
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,890
That's what they count and count that
because you get to count line down in bed

176
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:59,730
then too. That's fallen down. Yeah, they
gave a bitch. You went to sleep? Yeah man.

177
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,570
So basically what I'm saying is
fuck that old way, way commercial.

178
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,120
I've been, that's what I came here. So
thank you. I'm glad you're here man.

179
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,400
Promote naturebox and say fuck that
stupid commercial. Yeah, congrats.

180
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:19,260
The nature box. There's congrats to them.
Cause this, this is pretty new company,

181
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:20,550
right? Well is it? Yeah, I think so.

182
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,490
Honestly don't know too much about him
other than their stuff. Taste good.

183
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,420
But yeah, I mean I know it's
cheesy and you know, Oh,

184
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,910
you'll philosophical quote shit.
But this was an idea and is now is good.

185
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:33,680
And his hair. Yeah. I like when anybody

186
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,290
comes up with anything. That's
a good idea. It's interesting.

187
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,070
It's interesting to see new companies
sprout out because of the Internet to like

188
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:43,250
this business is now, he could
have never had it. Like today,

189
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:46,570
if you ever want an excuse to start
your own business, today's the fuck.

190
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:51,110
Like here's this company vehement knives.
They make homemade knives. They sent me,

191
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:53,650
they made me a knife,
beautiful handcrafted knife.

192
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:57,080
Like they sent me a video of how
they made it. Right then it's like,

193
00:10:57,081 --> 00:11:00,530
it's beautiful, handcrafted
artisan ship. You know. I mean,

194
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:01,670
I didn't really need a knife,

195
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,330
but it's cool as fuck that somebody
would do that and it's cool as fuck that.

196
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,110
These guys who are listening to the
podcast, their podcast listeners,

197
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,520
they came up with an idea for company
and they started doing it and now it's

198
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:14,240
there. That's their job.
That's their business.

199
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,330
They don't have to work for anybody.
That was awesome. Making your own shit,

200
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,920
making, making knives or whatever.
Making old record players.

201
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:23,150
Who knows the fuck you want to make.

202
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,090
What you going to do with
that knife that night?

203
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:27,550
Just like so it's going to sit
around my house and look cool.

204
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,840
It's like a trophy wife. You never fucked,
you know one of those just sit around.

205
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,050
It looks sporty. No, I'll
take it somewhere. Maybe take
it hunting things go hard.

206
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:39,070
We wrong. I might need it. Yeah. You know,

207
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,530
you get attacked by something out in
the wild. You gotta defend yourself.

208
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,160
I have plans, I strategies in my head
like what I would do from mountain.

209
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:48,320
Mine jumped me.
It was fucking me up.

210
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,140
I have like an idea in my head
or how I'd fight it with a knife.

211
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,250
Yeah, because where to hit it at? Where'd

212
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,980
you hit it with the knife first,
which you get in the face and the gut.

213
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,580
You've got to give the animal something
to bite onto. That's very important.

214
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,080
You've got to put something in front of
the animal so that it bites that before

215
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:08,380
applying to you. So bites the
first thing. Get instinctively.

216
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,350
That's when he stabbed in the neck.
That's what I'm saying.

217
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:12,490
That's a great strategy.

218
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,190
I think that's the only strategy you
gotta be willing to sacrifice one of your

219
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:19,060
arms though. Your arms going to
get mauled. Cause I couldn't,

220
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,960
I'm pretty logical, but at times
I'm a rational and delusional.

221
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,060
So I think that I could knock out
a mountain lion with a two hit cop,

222
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,190
two hit Combo and I
hit him with the right.

223
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:33,490
Hit Him with the left and I'm stepping
back to the young man confidence.

224
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,080
Your punching power
plant. My feet house cat.

225
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,440
I'm trying to knock out a house.

226
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,070
A house cat can take a fucking tremendous
punch. Really very rare. They go out.

227
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,150
Well, I never punched a cat. What?

228
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:50,950
I did watch a cat jump from a
tree and it just stuck in a tree.

229
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:55,540
I mean this fucking cat must have
fallen like 30 feet, hit the ground,

230
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,630
Bam. And started running.
I mean it was unbelievable.

231
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,160
I thought the cat was dead for sure.

232
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,280
I was watching the cat started
running and hit the ground.

233
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,800
It's a video is a video of it on youtube.
I saw it online.

234
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,940
The cat hits the ground and
fucking takes off at full clip.

235
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,930
Doesn't go whoa, hold up. What the
fuck just happened? Cat fell 30 feet,

236
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:17,330
which is approximately like, what would
that be for a person? I don't know.

237
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:22,300
Six foot tall person falling 30 feet.
It'd be terrible compared to a cat.

238
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,770
Cat is four inches high. Yeah. Fell
that far and it was fine. That's crazy.

239
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:30,130
Cause I can't even walk right away.
If I had like a huge Fart,

240
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,280
I still kinda got to, I can't. I
got a little bit, yeah, get shaky.

241
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,260
Shaky of, yeah. It's all
good for that cat food.

242
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,160
Just be it. I think they have really
flexible bones. Don't think cats.

243
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,270
Cats like they, uh, you know, they're
built different than us. Yeah, they can.

244
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,360
They can definitely take
impacts. We can't, right.

245
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,720
My point is I don't think the left right
going to work. I don't think it would.

246
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,750
You might have to get the, I
clench the knees techniques.

247
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,980
Yeah. Here's the cat. Watch
his fucking cat is kept.
Falls out of his fucking tree,

248
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:09,700
man. You like that cat's dead. Right.
Okay. First of all, I said 30 feet.

249
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,840
That shit's way higher than 30 feet. 80
feet. Look at that. Boom and then see ya.

250
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,130
And the cat runs off the feet.
The cat fell 80 feet. Okay.

251
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:21,010
That's just a different thing.
They're just way different than us.

252
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:25,360
Look at that cat's fine. That cat
is broken up, but is this shock?

253
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:31,060
You might be right. I might be right.
I mean, look at that shit though, man.

254
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,710
Oof. Did it follow this? It's like a fell
out. It's back. Yeah. That's a shitty cat.

255
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:38,480
Cat is broken up. That's a
shitty cat. I thought. Cat.

256
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:39,820
So he's filling their fat cat.

257
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,500
That cat had human like self consciousness
where you know how we fuck that.

258
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,760
I'm cool. I'm cool. That's what that
cat was doing. That cat isn't that fine?

259
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,070
I think you're probably right. And you
notice it hit the and the way down.

260
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,790
I bet it got knocked the fuck out, but
that's what happened. I bet it got dazed.

261
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,710
He'd probably crack one of those branches
and then maybe that that's what helped

262
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:04,220
it survive. Maybe gain k owed
by the branch. Like watch this

263
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,310
man. Did it hit a branch? Yeah.

264
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,500
I wonder what part hit the branch and
then they ran under the car. Yeah.

265
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,060
Okay. That's good bank. Yeah.
Yeah. See it. Bam. Yeah, it
definitely hit that tree.

266
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,720
At least it looks like in that
perspective. Poor cat. Anyway,

267
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:27,110
he's fine amount of lines like
that, but bigger. In fact,

268
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:30,830
they say that like house cats and
mountain lions are very similar in their

269
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:35,270
amount of power. You know like what
they can generate pound of body weight,

270
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,110
which is pretty fucking crazy when you
think that a mountain lion is out there

271
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:42,890
running around like a 50 pound mountain
line would fucking kill you easy then.

272
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,351
Yeah,

273
00:15:43,351 --> 00:15:47,090
that would be a bummer the way to do you
go into woods and hunt and stuff like

274
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:49,790
that? Yeah, I've been doing that recently.

275
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,320
But when you go there in the
woods hunting, you're armed.

276
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,700
You're not worried nearly
as much as if you're hiking.

277
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,620
You go in California
where you go? No, I have,

278
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,380
well I've been pig hunting in California.

279
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,390
Went wild pig hunting did once it
have been a Wisconsin and Montana,

280
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,900
the two places in Montana has been
the only place I camped out outside.

281
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,830
And do you have a hundred and crew?
Was it other comics? So as you got,

282
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,310
what would Brian Cowen, yeah,
yeah. I went with him twice.

283
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,220
We didn't go pig hunting together. I went
out with another guy. I went with this,

284
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:22,070
there's a guy named Steve Rinella and a,

285
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,860
he's got this TV show called
meat eater and he's a hunter.

286
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,660
He took us hunting and I got hooked
on it. Really do. Fascinating Shit.

287
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,500
Do you eat the stuff you hunted? Yeah,
I try and I'm trying to only eat that.

288
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,150
That's what I'm trying to depression.
I'm process. Yeah. I mean it's,

289
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,670
it's a hundred percent organic
except footed lit. Yeah.

290
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:45,671
You don't have to keep showing that pig
that's a photo of the pig murdered it.

291
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,160
He can't say murder
cause it's not a person.

292
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,050
I suppose to say harvest
harvest makes it sound better.

293
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,180
That's still like killing an animal.

294
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,390
But you kill an animal every time you eat
a ham sandwich. Harvest tomatoes. Yeah.

295
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,160
Well they think of it as crops, not its
crops, but as you know, something you're,

296
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:04,700
you're getting out of the earth. You
know, harvesting an animal from the earth,

297
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,080
bringing it home and eating it. I'm
trying to only eat that at home, you know,

298
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:13,130
I just think there's a lot of bad
Karma attached to factory farming.

299
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,450
I just think I'd like meat. I don't
want to give up the idea of eating meat,

300
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:21,680
but the eye and you watch those videos
and people could say all they want about

301
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,040
that's, you know, a
fraction of those, you know,

302
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,000
of those animals get treated like that.

303
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,170
Most animals get treated
ethically and humanely.

304
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,150
I drive a friend who has a farm
and he raises a grass fed beef.

305
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:37,980
He raises these beef for slaughter.
They have a full pasture,

306
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,720
the grazing and they, you know, they're
out there eating grass, no hormones,

307
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,280
no antibiotics, no nothing. Those
cats, those, they're scared as fuck.

308
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,890
I'll give you go anywhere near those
cows. Those cows freak out. You know why?

309
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,590
Because they know we're killers and
we're going to eat them eventually and

310
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:56,400
they're trapped in this cage. Like the
idea that it's way better, it's better.

311
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,820
It's definitely better. Most of the time
it's better, but it's still a freak out.

312
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,320
They're still trapped.

313
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,943
Well,

314
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,050
just a lot in life they took given
they were given it a lot in life.

315
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,450
That's a Saki lot in life.
It is.

316
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,080
But so you so use this though because
hunting is just doing the same thing but

317
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:19,960
on a, on a more base level,
just on a smaller level

318
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,690
in a way. Yeah. You just doing it. I mean,

319
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:24,820
you cutting out the middleman
and you're cutting out,

320
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,940
you're cutting out the middle man in
the animals living completely wild.

321
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,660
This is like a concept behind hunting
that certain types of people do.

322
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:33,060
It's called fair chase.
Yeah.

323
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,850
And what that means is that you're not
dealing with an fenced in environment

324
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,810
that you're only hunting and an
animal that's truly wild, wild animal.

325
00:18:40,811 --> 00:18:44,860
They can go wherever it wants.
So in order to harvest this animal,

326
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:48,400
you have to figure out how to get close
enough to it. You've got to stock it,

327
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,730
you got a, you know, you got to
understand where the wind's blowing.

328
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,640
Like there's a lot of factors involved.
And when you take that animal,

329
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:58,690
most likely that an animal would not have
even known you existed until it died,

330
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,290
like out of nowhere. It just dies.
Right. And it's the most ethical way.

331
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,580
But that animal's still scared as fuck.
If it sees a person and the reason being,

332
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:08,500
because there's people like
me that will shoot it. Right.

333
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,440
No, I see. That was and that
bit, you know, just chilling out,

334
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:13,790
waiting to and has seen it.

335
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,250
It hasn't just seen his friends
be slaughtered and hung up.

336
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,060
Yeah. It's not trapped. Yeah.
You know, it's a wild animal.

337
00:19:20,061 --> 00:19:23,240
You're going out and getting a wild
animal, but it's also a wild animal.

338
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:25,910
That's most of the time they're aware
of people and then they don't want to be

339
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,360
anywhere near us. Yeah. The,

340
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,400
the real tripper is when you can go
and you could see a wild animal that

341
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:35,360
probably never saw a fucking human being
like go up to the Yukon or some shit.

342
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,980
Yeah. And then they freak
out. Or they, they don't even
know what the fuck you are.

343
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,460
A caribou. Caribou will just look
at you like, what the fuck is this?

344
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,700
Sometimes antelopes will come towards
people because they don't know what the

345
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:49,220
fuck they are. Yeah. They're
like, what the fuck are you,

346
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,960
I never seen when you were four
and then point blank. Yeah.

347
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,950
Well not that close. You just don't get
that close, but they will look at you.

348
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,020
But sometimes antelopes had been
encountered people and sometimes Caribou.

349
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:04,730
We encounter people and
once I've encountered people
they'd get way touch here.

350
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,700
Yeah.
Do you have a catch phrase when you hunt

351
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:14,150
when you hit one? I sh I need
one. Well yeah. Is that it?

352
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,120
Blam blam we eat ham.

353
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:25,600
That's awesome. That's the perfect
one for pig hunting. Pick one.

354
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,790
I'm actually,
uh,

355
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,250
I'm in the process of brining a ham
right now that I'm going to smoke.

356
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:36,430
I bought a smarter means soak it in and
it's soaked in salt and brown sugar and

357
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:42,890
um, it's been soaking in this,
this brine for like five days.

358
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,890
Wow. And I'm going to, I'm going to smoke
it tomorrow. Yeah. That's awesome man.

359
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,800
This new thing I'm into,
that's great dude.

360
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,780
I eat almost exclusively delivery,
so we lead opposite lives.

361
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,870
Totally opposite labs. I love delivery.
Don't get me wrong. Deliveries.

362
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,070
Like one of the greatest things ever
that you could sit in your house and

363
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:05,230
someone could bring you a delicious food.
Yeah.

364
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,570
But yeah, we're at the opposite
spectrums of Eden. I am.

365
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,730
Natalie is a middleman,
but there's somebody,

366
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,780
there's a lot of the steps with somebody
bringing it to me, to your house,

367
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,010
my house to the restaurant using an app
to do what I'm using seamless web to do

368
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:21,720
it and that's going to the restaurant.

369
00:21:21,721 --> 00:21:23,550
The restaurant's getting
the food from somewhere.

370
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:27,480
Then this making the food and bringing
it to me through and you're actually

371
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,300
going and shooting pigs in the face.

372
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,240
You don't want to shoot him
in the face where you do,

373
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:36,190
but you don't want to mess miss them.
You know,

374
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:40,120
if you could shoot him in the head, that'd
be ideal. Yeah. The phases. The head.

375
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,060
Yeah, you're right. What you
mean side of the head? No,

376
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,730
you really want to go for the heart
and the lungs. You go for the body.

377
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,830
That's how you,
uh,

378
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,990
that's how you usually stop them because
you can miss the hat and graze their

379
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:52,560
nose, blow their face off.
That happens sometimes. Yeah.

380
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,010
Like deer get their face blown off.

381
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:57,130
Someone tries for a headshot and they
mess and then the animal is still running

382
00:21:57,131 --> 00:22:00,010
around with half a face. Well,
I was just trying to be funny.

383
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,823
Okay.

384
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,970
Me Too. I just failed my part. Failed.

385
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,470
Do you think you could ever do it?
You ever thought about going hunting?

386
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,520
Oh, no, I don't. I'm not a
patient person. I'm very, uh,

387
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:22,480
I need stuff to happen right away.
Right. So, yeah, I don't, I don't know.

388
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,420
I actually, only time I've ever, I was
in Mississippi when I was a kid. Uh,

389
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,690
my aunt stayed in the country and
missing like I sold the business.

390
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,680
It was a small towns. It's
very conscious. So they,

391
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,660
they were wild hogs around and I was,
I had a shotgun and I was able to,

392
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,660
to shoot one shot off at a, at a pig
that I missed. So that was my only,

393
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,930
that's my only experience with a hunting.

394
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:47,800
I fished once and caught a fish and
now it was pretty cool. But yeah,

395
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,940
I maybe I could do it.

396
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,930
It will be a different
experience just to be in that,

397
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:55,250
just that type of life. And
just knowing that, you know,

398
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,980
it's people that do that a lot.
Just seeing that, that type of work.

399
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,770
Like I, uh, for my pilot
for comedy central,

400
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:07,771
I worked on a goat farm actually
where they milk the goats.

401
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:12,420
Uh, they, you know, they, they sell
goat milk and everything there. And uh,

402
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,790
they got the Billy goats and
then it was a, it was real.

403
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,690
It was really different just
being in that, in that, uh,

404
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,970
in that environment where
this is these people,

405
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:26,680
this is what they do for a living.
And they just live off goats state,

406
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:29,710
you know? Yeah. They milked
goats, they got goat cheese,

407
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:34,300
they got goat lip balm and this
crazy thing, you know. So that was,

408
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,270
that was real cool. So I am interested
in our world. I don't know if I could,

409
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,740
I could probably visited
your urbanized. Yeah,

410
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:45,560
I'm urbanized to the core. I think maybe.
Oh, you know, maybe we'll get, I would,

411
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,710
you know, try some different stuff and,
and do it for an extended amount of time.

412
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,260
But right now I'm pretty
comfortable. Yeah, no, look,

413
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,410
the cities are definitely
awesome invention. Yeah.

414
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,150
What a great idea to cut all that
nonsense out. Yeah. But the thing,

415
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,960
the thing I found about is that they're
nonsense or the hunting and fishing too.

416
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:07,370
They're fun. Yeah. They're fun on some
weird visceral level. It's funny. Yeah.

417
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,750
You fairly, yeah. It feels,

418
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,680
it feels good to go through that where
you kill the animal you do to mediate it

419
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,090
and, and you, you make
it. Yeah. You did it out.

420
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,900
It has a feel. Yeah. Real fulfilling.
And, and you know, that's, I mean,

421
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,060
that's what we used to do as,
as humans.

422
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:26,000
So you think you'd be interested
in going hunting on a TV show?

423
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,120
Would you be interested in doing it?
Probably.

424
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,630
Great idea for a show. I think that's
the next show. I mean like Steve Rinella,

425
00:24:34,631 --> 00:24:37,600
this guy that, uh, from the host of media,
and I've been trying to think of a show.

426
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,630
I think the show is
taking comedians hunting.

427
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,340
I think that's, look, that's something
that, it's a very controversial thing too.

428
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,000
I mean I don't find it con I
think if you a immediately,

429
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,900
you can't really find it if
you're media controversy,

430
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,940
but you saw about vegetarian

431
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,300
vegetarians have an issue
with it but really dummies.

432
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,380
It's very controversial with dummies, you
know dummies love to knee jerk on that.

433
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,350
Like, oh you want to shoot an
animal? Is that what you want to do?

434
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,860
You I had to kill animals.
You a bad ass. Bad Ass.

435
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:12,260
Why don't you need to use a knife?
Like they'll say something.

436
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,720
Why don't use your bare hands?
Yeah. Cause you'd fucking lose.

437
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,010
Oh Bitch. What team are you on? Is People
that Feifei it just did in that sense.

438
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,270
You know, it's funny with Pete,
like not a vegetarian debate,

439
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:27,620
but my girlfriend is vegetarian but uh,

440
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,220
and kosher. But each fish. Huh? But,

441
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,290
and I try to say that's not true.

442
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,210
Vegetarian eat salmon and then
only certain types of fish though.

443
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,290
Only child fully kosher fish.
Kosher fish. Oh, she's crazy.

444
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:46,560
You got to get away from her. No, she's,
she's good. That's Voodoo. Oh sure.

445
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:51,770
You food. It's food. I tried
to say like that's old rules.

446
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,480
It's so dumb.
They update it.

447
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,060
Well you know they use that as
like it's certain slaughterhouses,

448
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,160
they have to have a rabbi come and they
see use a knife and the slaughterhouse W

449
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,350
W we filmed fear factor
in a slaughter house.

450
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,420
And that was the first
time in my life that I,

451
00:26:07,421 --> 00:26:12,421
I recognized very clearly
that places contain memories.

452
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,400
They contain something, some feeling of
some shit that went down there. Yeah.

453
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,760
Cause the moment I walked into that
slaughterhouse like the moment,

454
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:23,310
like as you get closer to
it for you park your car,

455
00:26:23,311 --> 00:26:26,610
you get out of your car and start
walking towards the door. You feel heavy,

456
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,890
you feel it. You could feel it.
You feel weird shit in that place.

457
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:35,190
She walking around. It might be
psychological, but it might also be,

458
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,280
that place is still buzzing with a million
fucking slaughtered cows freak outs.

459
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,070
Cause it feels like it.
It feels like a where if

460
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,120
you came around that spot,

461
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:49,080
if you were like in the old school game
of Thrones days and you came over a hill

462
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:51,660
and you might stop, why do it? Why
does this place feel fucking shitty?

463
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,440
What does going, what's what
happened here? What Joe. Dot.

464
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,990
Phil and Co also going a bit, man,
I'm about to make strange as eat bugs.

465
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:03,110
There was no eating bugs. It was a
simple task. Then it's dunked her head,

466
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,960
her blood and pull out cow
hearts with their teeth.

467
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,800
What you felt the vibe of that place mom?
Probably full of Shit.

468
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:11,820
I know I was high as fuck,

469
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,860
so I might've just been tricking
myself into thinking it.

470
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,280
A lot of people get mad sometimes
and when I say, you know,

471
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:21,960
you feel good and it
doesn't make any sense,

472
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:24,420
it shit doesn't even make
sense to me. Alright. Relax.

473
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,490
People get upset about pay news.
It's easy to yeah, to kind of people.

474
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,940
You got to take yourself out of yourself
sometimes I remember like, Oh yeah,

475
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,000
that's just the person was saying stuff
like you also gotta be able to poke

476
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,290
holes in your own theory. You have to
like right there, like I'm telling you,

477
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:44,520
I felt this weird, crazy thing,
but the reality is I was highly,

478
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,390
highly lit up on marijuana. I mean, I
was lit up, used to shoot that show.

479
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:50,910
How I would do every episode
high as fuck so high.

480
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:54,700
Sometimes I forget how to talk right?
I can never,

481
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,900
I mean the only way I could do it and
enjoy it because it was so preposterous.

482
00:27:57,901 --> 00:28:00,890
After like eight or nine episodes,
I was like wow, this is the most,

483
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,130
and I was like, God damn it. This show
is going to, it's going to stay on TV.

484
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,450
You know? On one hand I definitely
wanted to stay on TV. So it was great.

485
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,380
Great job. A lot of Nice people I worked
with, the money was great, NBC was great,

486
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,410
but on the other hand I'm like, oh
my God, how can I keep doing this?

487
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,210
I don't know if I can keep doing this.

488
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,240
So it was like a a beautiful job but a
job but a job that I could do high rises.

489
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,820
Then it became fun once
I could do it. Hi. Yes,

490
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:31,340
funny cause I never smoked weed before.
TV appearances,

491
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,760
anything on TV, but people think
I'm high on TV all the time.

492
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,890
Well if you got tested you would be high.
I think the, what you're talking about,

493
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:45,120
it's like intoxicated or affected.
There's two different things,

494
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,820
you know what I'm saying? No, I'm
always affected by, we'd always,

495
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,660
they basically medicated by weed,
but I'm not always high. Right.

496
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,490
But I'm affected you mean because you
might have smelled a couple of days ago,

497
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:01,290
something like that.
Even a day ago,

498
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,860
two days ago went out because it
was a period where I really did,

499
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:08,910
was smoke weed for a few years. And even
then people say, are you high on stage?

500
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,260
Are you high right now?

501
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:15,240
You must be [inaudible] have a stoner
style comedy in a lot of ways. Well, I,

502
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,200
I mean it's, it's uh, it's, it sounds
like a negative, but it's a positive.

503
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:23,580
You're a thinking comedian. You, you're a
really funny writer. Like you take like,

504
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,440
like really hilarious,

505
00:29:25,441 --> 00:29:28,950
absurd turns in your comedy
and it's fun to listen to.

506
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,770
So like when you hear that you
go, oh, this guy's high as fuck,

507
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:34,320
he's coming up the shot because I
get annoyed because I'm like, if you,

508
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:36,600
if I was hiding,
do you know how bad this will be

509
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,010
if I was having what's up with all
these lights? Who's that? What are

510
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,570
you looking at me?
Why is he staring at me?

511
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,070
Why is it going with the
cameras staring at me

512
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,110
or you'd get used to it and
be like everything else.

513
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,190
The first time I ever got high on stage
I it was like skiing downhill when you

514
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:56,730
don't know how to stop. Yeah, it works.
Yeah. I mean I made it to the bottom.

515
00:29:56,731 --> 00:29:58,980
I didn't crash.
It was like one of my best sets ever,

516
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:02,460
but I didn't do it again for
like 10 years. I was terrified.

517
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,590
I was terrified. I just got high with
some friends and never quite sobered up.

518
00:30:07,591 --> 00:30:08,460
And then all my shit,

519
00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:13,190
I gotta go do comedy and I went
on stage just accidentally. Hi.

520
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,530
It was great,
but I was terrified.

521
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:20,210
Done it slightly high recently.
I can, but I can't be blitz.

522
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,710
I can't be blazed if I'm blazed.
Don't to blaze. I just got to leave.

523
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,490
But this is a public place with a bunch
of people. If I'm to blame. All right,

524
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:33,010
see y'all later. I'm going home
to my safe place. It's definitely

525
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,860
times when you can fuck up. You just
get, I want his, uh, there was a, um,

526
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,570
a professional jujitsu tournament
that I went to and met.

527
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,560
A friend of mine was competing in and
we went to watch him and support him.

528
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,740
And um,
after the,

529
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:50,610
the Jujitsu tournament who went
backstage and, um, we were, uh,

530
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,290
we were all on these pot edibles that
this friend had given us and they were

531
00:30:55,291 --> 00:31:00,120
pills. And my friend said to
only take one, don't take two.

532
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:04,770
I listened to him. I took one. My friend
Eddie took to Eddie Bravo, took two.

533
00:31:04,771 --> 00:31:09,771
And I was talking to this dude and I
was just way too high to be talking to

534
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:12,720
anybody.
And the dude that I was talking to,

535
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:15,480
it's just a straight killer
and he's a weird killer.

536
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,250
He's a guy who had a reputation when he
got in a street fight and actually kill

537
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:23,760
the guy with a triangle. They had to
revive the guy. He held onto the triangle,

538
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:28,470
the kind of an altercation on side of
a highway and he got out. I think he,

539
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,240
his friend fought the guy first and then
he fought the guy. I don't know that.

540
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,360
Oh, there's one of those regular
fight with a guy was a regular,

541
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,540
why president was trying to square up
like a regular person and any other

542
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:41,260
friends or like

543
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,130
fight for living. Exactly. Yeah.

544
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,770
I don't want to say the dude's name
because he wound up actually going to jail

545
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,360
for rape. Um, he, he raped
some chick allegedly. I mean,

546
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:56,910
I don't know what happened, but he got
arrested for olives now. Alia fans. Well,

547
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,420
I mean, I don't, I don't know what
happened. I don't know that the guy,

548
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:04,720
he actually had to like skip town. He, uh,

549
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,380
he took off and then they caught
him because he was doing Jujitsu,

550
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,400
couldn't stop doing Jujitsu.
He loved you Jitsu so much that he was,

551
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,780
he went to a gym and he was strangling
motherfuckers and the people couldn't

552
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:17,740
believe how good he was.

553
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,760
And there's a certain level where like
when you get to like a brown belt level

554
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:24,980
or black belt level, if
it's something some guy can
manhandle you, you like, Whoa,

555
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:26,440
who is this guy?
Like this is,

556
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:30,340
this is something crazy like w have you
competed before? Like ha who are like,

557
00:32:30,341 --> 00:32:32,890
why are you so good?
This guy was just that good.

558
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:35,740
He was just strangling all these people.
So the rose a bunch of suspicion.

559
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,510
So they checked out his name and they're
like, wow, that's a dude wanted for rate.

560
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:44,090
So I'm there super high as
fuck before the rape charge,

561
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,640
super high as fuck talking to
this guy. And I'm like, man,

562
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:51,260
something is wrong with this motherfucker.
I'm like picking up a vibration,

563
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,430
a vibration in his soul. He's willing to
go to dark places if you fuck with him,

564
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,830
like this is the wrong dude to fuck with.

565
00:32:57,831 --> 00:33:02,831
And then a couple months later he's
running from the police doing Jujitsu.

566
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:07,020
And then as a gnome deplore.
That's crazy. Late season.

567
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,500
Love it so much. I can, I'll do it.

568
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:14,180
It's like once you get really good at it,
it becomes like a video game.

569
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,900
But like imagine if you could play a
video game in real life where you actually

570
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:20,960
get to do all the killing and the other
guys really don't even have a good shot

571
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:24,560
of killing you like the
other. You go ahead and try.
I tried to choke me, you know,

572
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:26,480
that's how good this guy was.
This guy was so,

573
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:29,810
he was world class so he would just,
he couldn't resist.

574
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,670
He wanted to go there and just
strangle a bunch of men. You know,

575
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,450
I don't know what it was.
I mean,

576
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:38,690
somebody might have fucked with him when
he was young and he never forgot it and

577
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:42,920
he, you know, that's, that happens a lot
of guys, they have like childhood abuse.

578
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,980
Somebody kicks their ass when they're
a kid and they just become this fucking

579
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:50,090
savage because of that develop
that defensive mechanism. You know,

580
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,810
I enjoy fighting,
but I,

581
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,430
when I watch it like fight and
comes off me enjoy watching it,

582
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,600
I ends up watching it. Yeah. Yeah. I
enjoy watching fight and a in my mailbox,

583
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,220
but just cause it's fascinating.
Like Yo,

584
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:05,900
these dudes attack each other for living.
That's all they do

585
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,960
is hard way to make it too. It
was like, I'm going to put like,

586
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:15,680
that's crazy. Know this is my
dream, this is what I want to do.

587
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:19,190
I want to fight people and I'm willing
to take the chance that I might get

588
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:22,820
knocked out in front of thousands of
people and millions watching it. Oh.

589
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,630
I don't often recommend people
get high before sporting events,

590
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,890
but if there's a sporting event,

591
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:31,940
you should definitely get high at least
once and do their live. It's a UFC. Yeah.

592
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:35,990
Oh yeah. I might, my friends
do it all the time. You know?

593
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,280
Especially in places like
California where it's legal,

594
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,970
they're not really interested
in breaking any laws. Right.

595
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:44,750
Colorado where it's legal,
Washington state where it's
legal in Washington state.

596
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,240
Last time we went up there. You could
smell weed all throughout the place.

597
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:50,260
Really walked out. Stuck in the,
in the state at Vancouver too.

598
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,330
You go up to valley, you go. Why?
We had this is a UFC in Vancouver.

599
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:56,450
The whole place smells like weed. People
just light up. They just keep it low.

600
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,020
Light up right in the stands. Fuck
it. Yeah, man. Just to, I mean,

601
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,290
watching price probably is watching
somebody get knocked out high.

602
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:07,100
It would be crazy to me.
Live choked out lives crazy,

603
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,740
but it's also watching hub.
Goddamn could they are,

604
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,370
you know when you're super tuned
in for people who don't get high,

605
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,140
the idea behind it is like,
well yeah,

606
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:17,350
if there's something you
should get drunk and go do,

607
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,210
let's go get drunk and watched
the super bowl. You know?

608
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:22,430
That's stupid thing to say,
but what I'm saying,

609
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,270
get high and watch mixed martial arts.
You don't even have to watch UFC.

610
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:27,320
Watched some kickboxing.

611
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,800
When you watch think anything like high
level athletics were two dudes have a

612
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:34,150
lot at stake, which is what it is.
You're so tuned in to what they're doing.

613
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,530
You're so he, the whole
thing, it's like electrifying.

614
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,590
Right before I used to work for the UFC,
I never, I never do the UFC high ever.

615
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,240
But before I used to work for the UFC,

616
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:46,020
I used to love to get barbecue and
watched the fights. It was awesome.

617
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,940
So the whole thing,
it's such a such a wild experience,

618
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,050
like primal experience, you
know when your baked, he just

619
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,190
tune into it.
Yes.

620
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,360
Is to man,
I couldn't imagine getting,

621
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:08,310
just will have seen some of the highlights
of fights where it's just crazy.

622
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:13,311
Like a guy's getting his ass whooped and
all of a sudden he's whooping up like,

623
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,280
but getting destroyed.

624
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,140
Like the guy got a couple of
punches in like this dude is bloody,

625
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,720
he was just getting destroyed.
Like oh he's about to lose.

626
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:26,750
And then all of a sudden he has this dude
in a rear naked choke or something and

627
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:28,890
the dude is tapping out
like how did that happen?

628
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,980
How was he able to take
15 punches to the face?

629
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,570
It happens all the time.
You still win the fight.

630
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,970
There's certain dudes if you
could just take it. Yeah.

631
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,230
That's one of the things
that you learn when you watch
him. My man. Yeah. All that.

632
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:45,940
All men are created equal bullshit.
Yeah. That's how dirty, stinky lie.

633
00:36:45,941 --> 00:36:50,170
That will fuck you over if you believe
that all men are not created equal. No,

634
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,840
not even a little bit. There's some dudes
they can do shit. You can do that, right?

635
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:58,140
You can't move like Anderson Silva period.
Right.

636
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:02,290
If you're some dude who thinks it all men
are created equal and you get in there

637
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:03,220
with Anderson Silva,

638
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,360
that fucking guy moves like he moves
like he's in another dimension.

639
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,430
Most guys can't handle that. Okay, well I

640
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,710
that x's you exercise your
body, your legs, back,

641
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,170
arms, right? ABS, chest.
You could work that,

642
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,420
but how do you make your face job?
It's a lot of it's genetics.

643
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,510
It's genetically. How could you just
take funds is in the face? Well,

644
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,900
I can't pass out. I can't. I
mean I can, I can, you know,

645
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:32,520
I've been hit in the face many times,

646
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,960
but I know I don't like it and I know
I'm not the best at it. I don't like it.

647
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,850
Maybe there's a few people that
do like it, but I don't like it.

648
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:40,460
There's some dudes who forget fired up by,

649
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,490
but there's some guys that take
a shot way better. You know,

650
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:47,460
I don't have an extraordinary ability
to take a shot, but I don't have a,

651
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:51,450
I don't have a weak chin either. Some
guys it's really weird. Like, um,

652
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,040
it could be past trauma.

653
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,560
It could be that they've been
hitting the head too many times,

654
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,400
but some guys just can't take a shot at
all. They're just, it's weird. They just,

655
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,940
they get hit like half decent
and there they get wobbly.

656
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,910
Whereas like some dude's like Pacific
islanders, like Samoans. Yeah.

657
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,360
God Damn.

658
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:12,480
Those dudes are known for and be able
to take a shot like David [inaudible].

659
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,540
You ever see David to a fight?
No. He's a heavyweight boxer. Uh,

660
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:18,270
fought like he had like crazy potential.

661
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:21,630
He lost a Lennox Lewis when
Lennox Lewis was on the top there,

662
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,630
but David [inaudible]
was crow Russian people.

663
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:29,220
He knocked out John Ruiz pull
up David to a versus John Ruiz.

664
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,140
This was a,

665
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,010
when they were both contenders
before Ruiz won the and David

666
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,530
to a knocked him out one
brown Nate David too.

667
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:43,060
It was terrifying because he get hit
like a train and his head was like fire

668
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:47,800
hydrants sized and he could just bang
you just take them in the face. There is,

669
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,300
which is scary, right? Oh yeah.

670
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,910
And you see their Olympic bronze
medalist in 92 I mean he was a serious,

671
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:59,680
serious athlete, so it wasn't just
that he could take a great punch.

672
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,790
He was also an elite boxer.
I mean David [inaudible] in his prime,

673
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:08,020
he's one of the guys that gets
looked past like on any given night,

674
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:11,530
David [inaudible] might've been
able to beat everyone in the world.

675
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,670
It just putting together those nights over
and over and over again. Look at this.

676
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,780
Boom, Ruiz is hurt. Look
at this motherfucker.

677
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:23,470
Come on son. How good was
David [inaudible]? Terrifying.

678
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,830
That's,
that's the mall.

679
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,400
That's most embarrassing when you
have a you as an outside of the ring.

680
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:32,480
That's Worsten.
He says sub more demoralizing about that.

681
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,100
And your wife has their shit.

682
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,430
Yeah, dude, he got fucked
up. Kids are crying.

683
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,450
The world was deemed denied.
David to a versus Mike Tyson.

684
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,070
It's a denial, like the world lost
something because those two never fought.

685
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,210
You know,
I mean God Damn David Tool was good.

686
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,370
Lennox fought Tyson, but
Tyson was already, you know,
look at this, he's out cold.

687
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,970
But Tyson was a already,
you know,

688
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:02,060
pass his prime and he had chemical
problems and he was doing coke apparently.

689
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,320
So do you think when like say like David
[inaudible] was probably heavily favor

690
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,154
for that fight,
right?

691
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,270
I don't know who was favorite cause John
Ruisa stud man. John Ruiz is a, you know,

692
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,980
he,
he won the title.

693
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:20,050
He beat some really high level guys like
John John Ruiz, a real good boxer. Okay.

694
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,850
But say a two just caught him.

695
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,840
But I just mean like say a fight like
with too is it gets somebody to is highly

696
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:29,380
favored.
But this other guy has his team there.

697
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,260
You know that everybody's hyped.
Like you gotta get up.

698
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,680
But do you think there's people in that
say like, man, he's about to get his ass.

699
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,230
Of course you got to get
rid of those people, man.

700
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,980
I see people on your team that will say
that to you, man. Don't fight that dude.

701
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,320
You know what the fuck man.
You can't say that shit.

702
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,780
You do need to hear that though. You
know, you do need to hear that. You Go,

703
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,640
Oh want that.
You need it.

704
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,920
I mean, but it also is a,
it's a job to where like,

705
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,740
well he probably a little whip
my ass, but mortgages, dude,

706
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,680
this certain dudes like when d
like here's a perfect example,

707
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,610
when Vinny Pazienza
fought Roy Jones jr he,

708
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,430
someone should have pulled Vinea
side and went and listened. Dude,

709
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,780
don't fight this guy. Yeah. Like this
is not the guy for you. Not right now.

710
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,740
Did he beat the first round of something?
He was the only guy I ever,

711
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:20,820
Vinny Pazienza was to never score
a single punch and around ever.

712
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:26,300
Roy Jones hit him at will and he literally
couldn't hit Roy Jones was when Roy

713
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,360
Jones was in the matrix. It was
dancing and [inaudible] Jones. Yeah.

714
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,070
Jones went through like a series
of of of years where everybody was

715
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,280
like, oh, he's got no, he's got no
competition. You know, it's too bad.

716
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:39,080
There's not another really good fighter.
It's not,

717
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:40,040
there's not a really good fighter.

718
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:45,250
He says he's so fucking good that he
makes everybody else look like they don't

719
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:51,050
belong in there with him. Guys who in
any other era were bad motherfuckers,

720
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,880
right. Do this is Roy Jones when he was,
he was the best ever, in my opinion.

721
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:01,330
He was the most impressive fighter ever
for a period of a few answers to his rap

722
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:07,160
song. Yeah. Well, must've
forgot this is when he,

723
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:11,030
when he finished, patsy ends at the end
of the fight. God Damn, he was good.

724
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,370
Or is this the first round?
This is the first round.

725
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,790
This was when Roy Jones Jr was,
he was literally perfect.

726
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,780
He had reflexes that no one can fuck
with completely unorthodox style.

727
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:25,781
Very rarely used a jab use leaping left
hooks as much as you used the jab and

728
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:30,770
was just so fucking fast. Man. He just
couldn't catch up with that rhythm.

729
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,710
His rhythm was so fast.
It was just,

730
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:37,400
it would fuck with guys because they'd
get in there and you've got a certain

731
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:40,460
expectation of how long it's gonna take.
Four guy hits you.

732
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,570
So like if you're here and he's here,
maybe something could come here.

733
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:48,320
Maybe what we'll throw at John's house,
you'd be like,

734
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:51,350
Oh shit,
I can't get away from those.

735
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,360
I don't even know when those
are coming. Yeah. I saw a,

736
00:42:56,361 --> 00:43:01,150
I went to Mayweather Canelo ah,
that was a masterful work. Yeah.

737
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:01,911
And I asked her full,

738
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:04,880
I never see Mayweather alive and
I knew it was great obviously,

739
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:08,000
but when you see him live,
you see how fast he is.

740
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,320
Like so much than Canelo's only 21 or,

741
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:16,430
and may psalm 37 and he was way faster
than him and just dodged everything that

742
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:21,350
he anticipated. Every movie. It was crazy
to see how fast and just scale what he,

743
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:25,820
what, you know what it also is. It's
not just fast. He's really good.

744
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,730
He's really good technically.
And by that,

745
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:32,510
what I mean is that for folks
who just watch like a guy box,

746
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,640
you're seeing a guy move around,
you go,

747
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:38,270
oh well this guy is trying to hit this
guy and that guy was trying to avoid it.

748
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:41,060
But there's a language going on.

749
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,370
Just like when you're
speaking in a conversation,

750
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,960
just like with two people are speaking.

751
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,130
Like if you and I were talking and
we're having a good conversation,

752
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:54,020
it's because I'm recognizing what you're
saying and you're recognize what I'm

753
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:57,890
saying and we're combining our thoughts
together with laughing and having some

754
00:43:57,891 --> 00:43:59,420
fun.
This is like a flow to it,

755
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,290
but you could have a conversation with
some other person who just gets real

756
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:05,330
aggressive with you and Tim,

757
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,020
you don't want to talk because you're
intimidated or you start stuttering in

758
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,810
your words because you know this,

759
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:13,150
you think this guy's gonna
bark at you or you're,

760
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:17,030
you're worried that you're saying
something wrong because they're being very

761
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:18,410
judgmental towards you.

762
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,280
And so then the conversation takes
on a completely different flow. Well,

763
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:25,310
that's what fighting is. Fighting is
like that. It's like there's like,

764
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,880
there's like movements and there's
movements to get you to react and then

765
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:32,100
there's recognizing your movements and
your patterns and playing off of them

766
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,720
erupting those patterns.

767
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:36,360
Just like when someone's argumentative
and they interrupt you in mid

768
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:40,500
conversation to refute the first couple
things you said and it throws you off.

769
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:43,770
You can't keep failing.
You keep your try to finish your thought,

770
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:46,600
but it's not the same thought as it was
because they got blocked too. Right.

771
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,550
That's like a guy gets hit,
but he still tries to punch the gun.

772
00:44:49,551 --> 00:44:53,310
When the guys out of range knowing the
guys had a range just to let them know

773
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,450
it's really essentially the same
thing. So what may, whether is in his,

774
00:44:57,451 --> 00:45:01,050
his mastery is like a masterful
physical conversationalist.

775
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,110
He knows how to control the
action. That's, that's a
weird thing. It's like, oh,

776
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,000
there's a Voodoo to that
when a guy's had his best,

777
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,160
like a Roy Jones in his prime or a May,

778
00:45:11,161 --> 00:45:14,250
whether right now there's a Voodoo
to the way they move. Right.

779
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,060
You think Mayweather. He'll, he won't,

780
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,310
he won't get beat before
he retires or you think

781
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:23,410
I worry about him beating himself. Yeah.
I worry about him doing something crazy.

782
00:45:23,411 --> 00:45:26,620
Like you heard what happened with
those guys that were working for him.

783
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,460
Some jewelry went up missing.
He had these guys allegedly,

784
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,410
allegedly they got the shit beat
out of him. But now it's all,

785
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,300
it's all seems to go away.
No charges have been filed,

786
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:41,020
which is the right way to handle it.
Just sorry.

787
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,630
Apparently the guys weren't the
people who stole the jewelry.

788
00:45:43,631 --> 00:45:46,870
But look what I'm hearing.
You know, 18th hand stories.

789
00:45:46,871 --> 00:45:48,160
I don't know what the
fuck really happened,

790
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:52,330
but let's pretend nothing ever happened.
It was a total misunderstanding.

791
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,980
What I worry is it something like that
would happen and then he would wind up

792
00:45:56,981 --> 00:46:01,330
going to jail again. You
know? I mean, I just think the
guy, if you're a boxing fan,

793
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:04,540
I think he's one of the best
ever. I think he's, it's like a,

794
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:08,400
as far as like an athlete, I think
Mayweather's like a national hero. Yeah.

795
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,020
I mean not a national here like
a national treasure. You know,

796
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:14,920
it's like you should really pay attention
to this cause this is very rare that a

797
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:18,250
guy has this much better than everybody
around him. Nobody could touch him.

798
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,260
He's standing in front of a murderous
puncher and Canelo Alvarez and Canelo's

799
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:25,660
all frustrated and flustered
and he's can't hit the dude.

800
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,140
That's funny. I always hit people say,
hey, whether there's arrogant, Yay Erika.

801
00:46:30,141 --> 00:46:35,141
He punches people into Facebook living
and he's never lost it and he's not

802
00:46:35,271 --> 00:46:38,070
punching regular people would if he's
punching other people in the face.

803
00:46:38,071 --> 00:46:41,120
That also punch people
in the face for yes,

804
00:46:41,121 --> 00:46:45,140
he's arrogant and he'd done it over and
over and over for millions of dollars

805
00:46:45,141 --> 00:46:45,974
and that's all he does.

806
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:50,990
You can't be not arrogant and be
that good. You can not display it.

807
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,520
Yeah, you could do better at hiding
it, but that's tough. But with him,

808
00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:00,050
the thing is about hiding. It wouldn't
be necessarily beneficial financially.

809
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,090
Yeah.
If it's better to create that persona.

810
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,800
If people want to see him lose 20 30%
of the people that buy a main where the

811
00:47:06,801 --> 00:47:10,580
ticket or trying to see him lose,
I will say more 50.

812
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:14,360
It depends on who he's fighting.
Yeah. Well yeah, that's true.

813
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,340
But I mean like no
matter who he's fighting

814
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:20,500
Mexican flags in that in uh,
in the stadium when I was there.

815
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:25,150
That's true. But I think
there's some people that pay
to see him lose to anybody,

816
00:47:25,151 --> 00:47:29,530
whether it's Canelo Alvarez was
Filipino menu, no matter what anybody,

817
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:30,070
they just want

818
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,390
to see this motherfucker Lewis,
Ricky Hatton

819
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:38,230
there were so disappointed to the English
people thought this is the guy fucking

820
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:41,410
come over here at beat Floyd Mayweather
couldn't even touch that dude. It hasn't,

821
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:44,680
he had a downward spiral since.
Hadn't, hadn't did. Yeah.

822
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:48,760
He got knocked out by a pack gal really
bad after Mayweather. Knocked him out.

823
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:53,500
Mayweather knocked him out.
But Mayweather, like he hit
him with a left hook. He,

824
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:54,010
but he out.

825
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:57,610
It's just outboxed him master fleet and
then caught him on the chin or wobbled

826
00:47:57,611 --> 00:48:00,880
him and then finished him off.
But Manny Pacquiao slept him.

827
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:03,880
He caught him after that fight.

828
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,300
So it was too bad knockouts and then,
you know,

829
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,310
he took a lot of time off and
started hitting the white.

830
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,320
Yeah. Ricky Hatton need to get
in the supplements of business.

831
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:19,370
Well he came back, he got a, he had a
coke problem for a while. It got crazy,

832
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,490
you know, did a lot of partying, you know,

833
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:25,130
got depressed and then got right back
into it and got back in shape and had a

834
00:48:25,131 --> 00:48:27,830
fight and lost the fight.
But a,

835
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,070
I think he decided after that he just
couldn't perform at the same level anymore

836
00:48:31,071 --> 00:48:33,950
and he was going to retire.
But you've got to realize for him,

837
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,280
if you're listening, Ricky,
you can't expect you bought it.

838
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:41,090
It bounce completely back with one
fight after he did coke for five years.

839
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,770
You know, I mean, I dunno what
they told you coke does, but uh,

840
00:48:45,771 --> 00:48:47,810
you need to give yourself
some recovery time.

841
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:51,110
You know coke set in this,

842
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,240
I know people did coke in the 70s they
have like serious neural muscular problem.

843
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,450
So Shit.
Yeah,

844
00:48:56,451 --> 00:49:00,050
the people like a lot of old people that
did a lot of coke like way back when

845
00:49:00,051 --> 00:49:04,820
they developed like all sorts of
like weird nervous problems. Weird.

846
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:07,400
We're weird issues with
controlling their bodies.

847
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:11,280
You know like there's a direct connection
that a lot of people have with a,

848
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,780
with Richard Pryor went through when he
was older with all the coke that he did

849
00:49:14,781 --> 00:49:15,614
when he was younger.

850
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,370
Yeah.
So don't do that much coke,

851
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,470
coke and moderation. Everybody in
light moderation if you have to,

852
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,210
if that don't do it at all.

853
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,700
I also think it's real. It's a real
problem with coke being illegals.

854
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:33,270
You don't know what the fuck you're
getting a coke mixed with some speed.

855
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,693
Yeah.

856
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:40,840
Well you know the government can't
get go that far in legalized coke.

857
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,000
Do you? Don't think so. Do you?
What about decriminalizing it?

858
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,010
Do you think that that's possible?
That's possible.

859
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,680
I still make it.
It's still a B.

860
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,890
I think it will still have
the same problems. Right?

861
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,150
But what did it mean? How much? How
much worse? I've never done coke.

862
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:59,530
How much worse is coke than alcohol? When
you see someone who's really fucked up,

863
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:00,790
drunk,
violent,

864
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,780
I've seen people that are due to become
totally rapey when they get drunk,

865
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:09,070
just grabbing girls outside of clubs
can't bitch. I've seen people get crazy.

866
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,290
Come on girl. What the
fuck you too. Good for me.

867
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:15,700
It's a tough comparison just
because of how people take them.

868
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:19,820
You know what I mean? Like people,
you might have eight shots of lick,

869
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,960
but for the most part people,

870
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,670
I mean there's some people definitely
that's on the extreme side,

871
00:50:24,671 --> 00:50:27,760
but you're not going
to keep on it and coke,

872
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,430
uh, that is a problem. Right?
And so once you feed that monkey,

873
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:34,980
you want to keep feeding it. Yeah. That's
the difference, right? Cause you guys,

874
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,960
you can also get kinda crazy apparently
when you've been doing coke all night.

875
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:41,390
Like you don't know what the
fuck you're doing, you know,

876
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,910
energy and you just feel
smarter than you are

877
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,610
how you are when you're drunk too. Right?
You're drunk, you're half retarded,

878
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:55,530
you think you're fine, but you
don't slur as much coke. Right.

879
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,260
But you talk more talk more. Yeah. That
is one of the most brutal things ever.

880
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,990
Talking to a drunk person when we Schober
or talking to a coke head when you saw,

881
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,853
which would you rather,

882
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,123
uh,

883
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,500
however out the top pride sort of cocaine
cause they probably at least have some

884
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:14,640
ideas and shit and he,
even if they had,

885
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,260
even if the ideas aren't that great,

886
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,030
I would be in my sober man so I'm
be able to tweak it to my advantage.

887
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,390
Da. Yeah. Oh, okay.

888
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:27,940
Counter. And it's like actually kind
of got the conversation a little bit.

889
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:35,080
Yeah. You know, Mike Young, do you know
Mike Young comedian? I know that is, yeah.

890
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,970
He had a great joke about a coke heads
that they always want to start businesses

891
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:39,370
with it.

892
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:40,203
Yeah,

893
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,620
true man. People will come up to
you with like grand plans. Yeah.

894
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:49,990
Do, I mean I, uh, I have add,

895
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,690
but I don't have an Adderall prescription,
but I get it.

896
00:51:52,691 --> 00:51:56,200
Sometimes I get out of raw sometimes
and when I take an Adderall at the

897
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,590
beginning of the day, man, I
just crushed life. Dude. I book,

898
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:04,050
I book all my flights for the next
month and a half. I'll get shit done,

899
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:09,190
shit done. I write, I make lists, I
handle stuff in my apartment and just,

900
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:13,380
uh, just handle the stuff on
Adderall. I'm legit add, I think.

901
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:18,190
Do you think that, um, okay, when
when someone says I'm a legit add.

902
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,360
Yeah. I believe you, and I'm
not questioning you but isn't,

903
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,750
you're talking about the effects of a
stimulant though, right? I mean, when,

904
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:29,740
when people do stimulants, that's
what happens. Yeah. But I think,

905
00:52:29,741 --> 00:52:33,220
cause I don't get to the point
where I'm like, Eh, like,

906
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:36,580
cause some people take Adderall and
they'll go, ah, there'll be really hype.

907
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,260
Well for me you wouldn't be able to
tell that I'm right, then I'm pumped up.

908
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:42,880
You know what I mean? Like
it, you have much more energy,

909
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,790
but I have much more energy and
just focus and I just handle stuff.

910
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:50,420
Whereas I normally, you know, I'll get
on the internet and just, I go, you know,

911
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:54,460
on my computer with plants and just in
a dicking around on Twitter, looking at,

912
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,290
I'll get caught up in a youtube
wormhole, you know what I mean? Wormhole,

913
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:03,760
I get nose. Oh Man. It's a waste.
Have you ever tried my [inaudible]?

914
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:07,870
Do you know what that is or what that is?
Is that your other supplement? No, no, no.

915
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:11,620
That's a pharmaceutical. Yeah.
Yeah. It's um, it's a smart drug.

916
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:15,470
There's new vigil and
Provigil Provigil was, uh,

917
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,960
the original one I think in new
visuals, the newer version. Anyway,

918
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,940
I've only taught, tried new
vaginal, but apparently this is,

919
00:53:21,941 --> 00:53:25,970
their effects are very similar.
It's this weird drug, right?

920
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,300
And what it does is it just gives you
energy, like when you're exhausted,

921
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:34,530
like say if you, um, like last night I
got decent amount of sleep, six hours.

922
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,740
I have kids. So six hours are pretty
good, you know, so I feel pretty good.

923
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,990
But if you get three hours
and you're like, fuck,

924
00:53:39,991 --> 00:53:42,570
I gotta do a bunch of Shit today,
you can take one of these new deals.

925
00:53:42,571 --> 00:53:46,020
And it's not like coffee.
It's not like that weird when I,

926
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,860
when I'm like really
tired but I drink coffee,

927
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:55,100
I get that buzzy but dull thing like
I'm kinda stupid but I'm moving around

928
00:53:55,711 --> 00:54:00,560
normal. This is not like that.
This is like, it alleviates
the sleepiness right on.

929
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:05,010
It's all gone, all gone and now
you have a energy and it's amazing.

930
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,790
Yeah. Yeah. Neat. Stuff like
that. Cause I got, you know,

931
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:13,140
stand up and working on show
the press stuff. Energy neat.

932
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:17,370
Especially for press site. If I had to
do more than impress on the road, man,

933
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:21,750
just to God, just to get through those
interviews and just to be, be on point.

934
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,350
I had to have something.
What folks don't realize

935
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,450
and we, you know, you fucking wait,

936
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:30,100
you gotta be there at like six in the
morning and you work til like 10 o'clock

937
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:33,190
at night on a most, you know,
most nights. Even later. Yeah.

938
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:36,610
It's not even, it's just a
thing. It's just to be on point.

939
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,920
Isn't that an [inaudible] I try not to
complain about just because it's part of

940
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:44,920
is part of the job and I'd rather do
it then work construction any day.

941
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:49,330
But sometimes mentally it's tough to
do a morning interview. But if I have,

942
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,840
if I have, you know, take Adderall
before then I'm snappy, I got jumped,

943
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,510
I got anecdotes and then I can kind of,

944
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:57,340
I know sometimes now
I was learning how to,

945
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,900
you got to take an interview
over sometimes or want to
not go on a rant but you

946
00:55:01,901 --> 00:55:05,830
have to not let them, you know,
just cause they can get into that,

947
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,170
cutting off your jokes and hey, a funny
man handlebars just cutting you off.

948
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:11,350
So just learning how to,

949
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:14,850
how to do that and just having the
energy and focus to be able to is,

950
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:19,210
it's real helpful. Yeah. The morning
radio thing, if like they're good,

951
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,810
it's great. It's real fun. It's pro
is supported and set you up and,

952
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:28,210
but then sometimes they just like, so
what's funny in the world right now? Like

953
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:35,170
inner bunny the other day,
the guy who asked me that exact question,

954
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,640
what's making you laugh
right now? Ah, to Hannah,

955
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:44,170
but what are you talking about on stage?
Oh Man, I hate when they do. Yeah.

956
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,400
Somebody asked me that before a show.
I was doing it.

957
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,970
And what are you going to talk about?
Man?

958
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:52,460
Just came up like what are we talking
about today? Like you now, you

959
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:58,210
dudes that would go,
well, here's my new piece.

960
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,240
It's all about how man is constricted by
a first his mom and his wife and a then

961
00:56:05,051 --> 00:56:06,730
ultimately his lawyer.

962
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,490
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I
guess the thing is just,

963
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:14,180
I try to remember that people aren't
coming from a shitty place normally.

964
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:18,860
They just don't know how to communicate
to me in a way that won't make me feel

965
00:56:18,861 --> 00:56:23,260
cynical and hate them. You know what
I mean? So I gotta keep that in mind.

966
00:56:23,261 --> 00:56:26,170
But in the moment, like what the fuck
are you just asking me? What's funny?

967
00:56:26,171 --> 00:56:27,130
In a world right now

968
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:28,950
for someone who's not a comic.

969
00:56:28,951 --> 00:56:31,020
They wouldn't understand
how awkward that would be.

970
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:35,280
Like what you like when you can go on a
radio show and they just let you talk.

971
00:56:35,281 --> 00:56:37,710
Right. Just go hang out.
Let's just hang out, hang out,

972
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,250
talk about stuff back and forth
from each other. Yeah. Yeah.

973
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:44,010
It's not a lot of them. They can
do that though. Cause that problem.

974
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,410
Do you ever do those radio tours?

975
00:56:46,411 --> 00:56:50,370
We have to call like 10 different people
and then you realize like eight of them

976
00:56:50,371 --> 00:56:53,250
have the same voice,
like almost exactly.

977
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:58,090
What does this, the radio
voice, I don't know what, when
it was tested, when it was,

978
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:01,350
it was, it was, it was a study that
people, that people like to listen to.

979
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:05,040
This right here, we live
here in Nashville. We got
Hannibal Buress in the studio.

980
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:08,970
We alive here in Cincinnati.
We got handled. There's a
couple versions of that.

981
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,130
This is a couple of versions
of that was just, you know,

982
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,530
and it was the sports guy as well.

983
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:18,600
Gus Johnson here for showtime.
There's the news guy.

984
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:23,400
It's just the same as um,
rappers though too. Like rappers,

985
00:57:23,401 --> 00:57:26,250
rap voice. You'd talk to a
rapper, they might sound like me,

986
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:31,320
but then when in their wrapped it like,
you know what it is, it's a persona.

987
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,410
It's just a persona that you know,
works for that situation

988
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:38,230
though. I liked the, the Gus Johnson
type voice. Like if a guy's, uh,

989
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,670
like when I say that about Gus Johnson,
I'm not putting them down.

990
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:45,190
Like I like that professional.
Here we are Madison Square Garden.

991
00:57:45,191 --> 00:57:49,870
I don't want a guy who's like,
Hey, I'm like me. Like I,

992
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,530
when I do the UFC there's a reason why
I'm the color guy and I'm not the play by

993
00:57:53,531 --> 00:57:57,940
play guy. I don't do the big,
here we are Joe FC one 52.

994
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,100
Like those guys are important.
I like that.

995
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,250
I mean it is [inaudible] tree.

996
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:06,130
Its pageantry isn't a reason why
Michael buffer works well. Yeah.

997
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:11,131
That's even more so because
he's a announcer said let's
get ready to rumble this

998
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:15,930
pageantry dog pageants. Yeah. I'm
not putting it down but it is weird.

999
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:19,810
Radio is weird and radio cause you don't
have to talk like radio's different

1000
00:58:19,811 --> 00:58:23,290
cause it's supposed to be your
personality. You know what I mean?

1001
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:26,710
Like sports as a sports guy,
the news is the news,

1002
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,320
but radios was to be your vibe.

1003
00:58:29,321 --> 00:58:31,690
But then you sound like the
dude in Saint Louis also.

1004
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:34,090
You sound like the dude
who's all over the place.

1005
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:38,250
Every guy you know another
place where that exists. What
was that? Strip club Djs.

1006
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:39,500
Uh,
yeah,

1007
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:43,720
I've been trying to analyze this for many
years and I think with Strip club Djs

1008
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:47,860
it's like no one wants to hear a dude
talking while girls are dancing naked.

1009
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:51,490
You do not want to hear that guy.
So he's got to make it like a song,

1010
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:55,930
like all ride coming to this stage.
It's amber,

1011
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,480
remember everybody $40 comic cons.
She's like,

1012
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,630
there's an entertainment aspect to that.
What he's doing.

1013
00:59:01,631 --> 00:59:03,490
It's like he's almost
like he's singing a song.

1014
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,850
What have you been to a black strip
club in Atlanta though? No, CJ's no.

1015
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:11,360
Those djs out of most amazing Dj's.

1016
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:15,470
Focally f really because
they drive the tipping,

1017
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:20,820
you know what I mean? They crack
jokes. I relapsed when I was in.

1018
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:25,610
It's so funny like man, you need to
pay the puzzle. They are bugs in here.

1019
00:59:25,611 --> 00:59:27,410
Y'all ain't spending money.
They'll drop the track.

1020
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,500
They'd come and cut the track by
not spend some mother fucking money.

1021
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:31,810
Look what she's doing up there.

1022
00:59:31,811 --> 00:59:35,900
She's up there like the
Atlanta Dj's is strip club.

1023
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,153
Amazing.
They

1024
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:43,810
probably just other black that black
strip clubs like the DJ drives that Shit

1025
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:49,820
and is the driving force
and as an entertainer in
addition to add he adds to it.

1026
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:55,310
See now I'm weighing the potential
dangers of going to a black strip club in

1027
00:59:55,311 --> 01:00:00,140
Atlanta with the entertainment aspect
of how amazing. That must dangerous man.

1028
01:00:00,141 --> 01:00:01,400
Isn't that that guy like me?

1029
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,313
No there's no,

1030
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:09,430
I'm sure.
I'm sure I need to go if I go with you.

1031
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:13,700
If I go with you I could slide right in.
I'm not even that blood. Then I play.

1032
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,480
Yeah the black in a black strip club.
The djs,

1033
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:23,500
the right and there famous ones is fate.
I don't know the names though.

1034
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,720
Cause I have a bit, but you go to
somewhere a magic city or magic city,

1035
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:32,070
a few other ones in
Atlanta. Uh, the Dj is, is,

1036
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:36,500
is important and makes the strippers
more money and the Strip was probably end

1037
01:00:36,501 --> 01:00:38,290
up tipping out the DJ.
Right?

1038
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,010
I'm sure. Yeah. They have like
an arrangement, right? Yeah.

1039
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,400
My friend Eddie used to work at a strip
club. I used to go and visit him at work,

1040
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,120
watch it. Who's Dj? So I got
to, I got to see the craft.

1041
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,740
I got to see how everybody does it.

1042
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:52,320
It's interesting the relationship
they all have, it becomes just like,

1043
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,940
I mean you might as well
be working in a restaurant.

1044
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:58,430
Everybody develops the same
sort of widespread. Exactly.

1045
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:02,730
People get naked and that's, it's weird
cause it's porn. Porn is like that too.

1046
01:01:02,731 --> 01:01:05,370
Like those people get used to each
other and it becomes just like any other

1047
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,850
normal.
So you later good Jason on you

1048
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:11,050
see?

1049
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:15,230
So I think it's probably funny when it's
just somebody who you fucked like two

1050
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:17,330
years ago.
Oh good to see you again.

1051
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:22,780
They, I think they have definitely a
more relaxed attitude about it. Yeah.

1052
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:25,910
You know, if you run into somebody that
used to fuck out of nowhere, you're like,

1053
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:31,370
hey, look at me. I see you naked.

1054
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:35,300
All right. You take care
of. Don't mind that Mo.

1055
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,450
It's weird when you haven't seen someone
at 20 years and then you get to see

1056
01:01:38,451 --> 01:01:42,320
like, whoa, this is weird. This
is weird. Hello, Nina Hartley.

1057
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:50,100
I met her. She's very nice lady. She was
doing Kevin Pereira as podcast. Yeah.

1058
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,770
I sat there and talked to her for awhile.
She does everything with gloves on, man.

1059
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:56,290
Good. Yeah. She has like
sex sessions with people.

1060
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:58,300
She puts like surgical gloves alone.

1061
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:00,910
Yes, he does corporates. Right. Does she?

1062
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:08,500
I think a lot of them, yeah. A lot
of them to do like corporate gigs.

1063
01:02:08,501 --> 01:02:13,120
Corporates in quotes, quotes,
I guess. Sort of. Yeah.

1064
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:18,220
And the way that corporates,
private privates. Yes.

1065
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,460
She does a lot of privates.

1066
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:25,320
Yeah. Like, you know. Yeah.
Very few comics do privates.

1067
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:28,640
What would you do if
someone said, hey man, uh,

1068
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:31,680
Burress I want you to come over
and just do comedy. Just for me.

1069
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:33,180
I'm just a big comedy fan,

1070
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:35,340
but I don't like going to comedy
clubs because it's fucking,

1071
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,080
I don't like laughing around other people.

1072
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:40,440
So could you just do your act for me and
I'll pay you what you get paid for like

1073
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:42,090
a regular show for a packed house

1074
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:45,320
for a no,
they add the charge to my,

1075
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:49,520
my corporate college
rate. Okay. And I would,

1076
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,210
I wouldn't want to do that.
Can I bring somebody with me?

1077
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,830
Well now you're worried about your safety.
Don't worry.

1078
01:02:55,831 --> 01:02:57,060
The guy's only going to masturbate.

1079
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,850
He promised nothing really crazy.

1080
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,820
He just wants to watch you just
he's going to keep his pants.

1081
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,170
Well keep a towel on.

1082
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,100
Nah,

1083
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,400
I'm not doing that good cause I don't
need the money that bad cause I got my own

1084
01:03:08,401 --> 01:03:08,980
supplements

1085
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:09,813
business

1086
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:14,300
so I'm that, you know, I could do
stuff as I want to do it, you know.

1087
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:18,330
All right. How about if the dude wears
like a space suit? The space suit? Yeah,

1088
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:19,693
there with a space.

1089
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,860
How long ago was that fucking full set.
Full outline set

1090
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:28,980
one dude. But one dude,
can I bring an opener

1091
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,470
toe to warm up?

1092
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:38,070
He's going to watch your past
specials so I can't even,

1093
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:42,600
I can't even drop him nets.
I got to do a hour new.

1094
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,340
Well it feels a fan man.

1095
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:51,900
You he'd already paid due to do a one on
one show. It does bits. You already know

1096
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:58,500
that was a shift from your last
Shaw crowd work. So this is crazy.

1097
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:03,480
Look at this place.
50 gs.

1098
01:04:03,481 --> 01:04:05,070
That's my rate for that weird ass shit.

1099
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:14,610
They're thinking about it. Some
fucking tech guy who's was super rich.

1100
01:04:14,611 --> 01:04:16,390
I'm going to get animal breasts.
You just to stand up.

1101
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,810
Well it will be less weird
if it was him and his buddy.

1102
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,660
That would be way less weird.
Two dudes would be.

1103
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:25,410
Isn't it an interesting like
inch instantly becomes less gay?

1104
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:26,271
Yeah.

1105
01:04:26,271 --> 01:04:31,271
Cause it's just also laugh at being at
a comedy show with some is about like

1106
01:04:31,941 --> 01:04:36,740
looking over at the person that, you
know what I mean? Like doing the elbow.

1107
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,620
So just doing stand up for one person.
It is weird as hell.

1108
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,400
Did you find it's weird even
to watch it on television?

1109
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,430
It, it, well it's a little, the vibe is
so much different, so much different.

1110
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:51,250
It's just a different energy and
just, it is, it is isn't not weird,

1111
01:04:51,251 --> 01:04:55,600
but it is where I've had people that
say they saw my stuff online or they saw

1112
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:59,680
stuff on TV, but then they saw me live and
he was like, Oh shit live. It was crazy.

1113
01:04:59,681 --> 01:05:00,700
So it is just,

1114
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
it's hard to translate the true energy
that's in the room and just that,

1115
01:05:06,421 --> 01:05:07,254
that type of thing.

1116
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,300
Yeah. They don't want tune into
you when they're watching a video.

1117
01:05:10,301 --> 01:05:12,730
They're just getting the words and
the performance. They're laughing,

1118
01:05:12,731 --> 01:05:13,810
but they're not too in India,

1119
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,240
if there's some dudes like
you'll see them on stage.

1120
01:05:16,241 --> 01:05:19,360
Like Brian Cowan is a perfect
example. Yeah. Brian Cowen,

1121
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,400
like if you watch them in a video,
he's hilarious.

1122
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:25,120
But if you watch him live that
dude like tune you tune into them,

1123
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:26,920
it's infinitely better.

1124
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:29,310
Well. Yeah cause the bits also, you know,

1125
01:05:29,311 --> 01:05:33,120
you might see a a minute set out
of somebody's hours, say online,

1126
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:34,460
but then in the,

1127
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,520
if somebody our club
say out a theater set,

1128
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:40,890
you didn't get to see how they enter in,

1129
01:05:40,891 --> 01:05:44,430
how they command at the room
at the beginning and how,

1130
01:05:44,431 --> 01:05:48,510
what they did at the beginning to allow
them to be able to go to a weird place

1131
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:51,090
later where the audience already
has that trust. So it's a,

1132
01:05:51,091 --> 01:05:54,690
it's a lot of different elements to live
standup that get lost in the Internet

1133
01:05:54,691 --> 01:05:55,150
and TV.

1134
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:59,230
That's a great point. The, the,
the building up like, you know,

1135
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,600
like I've ever had friends that were just
starting out and they'll do something

1136
01:06:02,601 --> 01:06:06,680
like they have a bit and they'll do
this bit like right away. And I'm like,

1137
01:06:06,681 --> 01:06:07,514
you know what man,

1138
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,040
the audience should probably get to know
you better before you do that bit there.

1139
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:16,270
Let them gain your trust first and then
do that bit because the opening part of

1140
01:06:16,461 --> 01:06:17,450
it,
like you're immediately,

1141
01:06:17,451 --> 01:06:20,330
you have to know you're a good person
for that to be funny. You got to know.

1142
01:06:20,331 --> 01:06:22,700
You're kidding. Right.
Otherwise it's just gross.

1143
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:26,670
Yeah. Like I got a joke about how,
uh, the movie I spit on your grave.

1144
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:30,600
Have you seen that? Yeah. It's a
weird movie and I do a bit about it,

1145
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:35,190
but I would never open with that.
That's is coming at least 25,

1146
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:38,490
30 minutes.
Then it's a touchy subject

1147
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:41,310
in that weird.
They have to have trust in you.

1148
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:43,660
Yeah. They have to ask for
us and like you can't, yeah.

1149
01:06:43,661 --> 01:06:45,700
You have to establish your
funny for a little bit.

1150
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:49,430
Yeah. And that's really hard, especially
when you're starting out. Yeah.

1151
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,650
People don't know you, you know,
once they come to Hannibal Presto,

1152
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:57,510
they know who you are. They're,
they're here to see you. But if you,

1153
01:06:57,570 --> 01:07:00,840
if you start now, man, if
you're just a first, you know,

1154
01:07:00,841 --> 01:07:03,420
first year guy like,
man,

1155
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:06,270
you got to really get
these people's attention.

1156
01:07:06,271 --> 01:07:08,730
Like you've got to figure out a way to
get them to trust you because they're

1157
01:07:08,731 --> 01:07:10,710
going to make a judgment call on
you within a couple of minutes.

1158
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:14,420
It's less. Yeah. They'll judge
you. The outfit, a black crowd.

1159
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:18,890
Why you walking up like Ah, it shoes.
So you already lost half the audience.

1160
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,870
[inaudible] it looks kind of weird.
Fin that's,

1161
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:24,830
you already got up work hard.

1162
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:27,990
Yeah. Damn, that's hilarious.

1163
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:32,160
Why are black clubs so
much more judgmental?

1164
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:37,630
It's just a, I mean there's just a
level of performance and just, you know,

1165
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,000
demand more man

1166
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:42,430
boy and just, you know,
that the best black comics,

1167
01:07:42,431 --> 01:07:46,780
it's just been great performance. You
know what I mean? So you talk about, yeah,

1168
01:07:46,781 --> 01:07:51,070
just a Red Fox and Richard Pryor
and Bernie like these as well.

1169
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:53,590
Not only, you know, great
joke writers and stuff,

1170
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:55,540
but they performed and they would crush.

1171
01:07:55,870 --> 01:08:00,520
And so it's just a higher standard
for performance also in, uh,

1172
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,600
black clubs or black, uh, showcase nights.

1173
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:09,340
The host is usually the star of the show
a lot of the time. You know what I mean?

1174
01:08:09,341 --> 01:08:13,960
Where on the road in an Improv, a
funny bone, they will see as local.

1175
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:16,650
Sometimes he's good, but
for the most part that, uh,

1176
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:18,530
the host is not going to be that great,

1177
01:08:18,531 --> 01:08:22,460
which is not cool because that's
who's setting the tone for the show.

1178
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:25,470
And just that you, the first person in
the audience seeing, you know, donate,

1179
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:28,550
they got babysitters and od
at and they, the, the host,

1180
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:32,540
the first person on stage is eh, where's
the host at? A black line is the,

1181
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:36,290
usually has a local following is great,

1182
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,290
crushes does 20th,
30 up top sometimes.

1183
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:42,500
And so it's just a different thing.

1184
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:46,640
So then the next act has to be able to
follow this amazing host with a great

1185
01:08:46,641 --> 01:08:47,001
file.
It,

1186
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:50,540
so it ends up with a lot of co comedians
been a lot of black comedians being

1187
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:53,540
real strong performance, uh, early on.

1188
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,910
I think that's interesting because,
you know,

1189
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:59,170
Chris Rock said that about his career
that like one time he had a go on after

1190
01:08:59,171 --> 01:09:01,010
Martin Lawrence. Yeah. And then he,

1191
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:04,540
he really was a turning point in his
career because he realized that he had

1192
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:06,430
performed to too many white crowds.
Yeah.

1193
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:08,320
And he was like white
crowds made him lazy.

1194
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:12,910
Like he didn't even realize he had gotten
into this sort of like lower energy

1195
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,060
sort of mode of performing.

1196
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:19,750
Yeah. Yeah. I was uh, I mean
I wouldn't say it was black.
Crowes it gave me a ship.

1197
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,091
I will,

1198
01:09:20,091 --> 01:09:25,091
I'm a little bit higher ed is he now
than I was in my first a CD but is that's

1199
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:27,860
just from um, play in, Oh shit.

1200
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:32,480
That's just some playing
bigger venues and learning.

1201
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:36,190
Joseph spilled coffee
on my fucking computer.

1202
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:38,600
A copy of this gives us unbelievable man.

1203
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:42,860
I've done this like four times in the
last month. Shit man. You know what it is,

1204
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:47,120
man. I keep this Coffee Cup right here
and I talk with my fucking hands because I

1205
01:09:47,121 --> 01:09:51,800
have peasant roots. Huh? Is that,
is that what that means? It's okay.

1206
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:56,410
The computer is going to be fine. Okay,
cool. Just a minor AppleCare which,

1207
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:00,110
but it was no one don't be like pitch.
This is the third time he came here.

1208
01:10:00,111 --> 01:10:04,700
He gets the fuck out of here. Stupid
as a 24 hour apple store in Manhattan.

1209
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,520
That's gotta be interesting.
Yeah,

1210
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,360
it's very interesting cause I
needed to get a new iPhone, uh,

1211
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:15,390
last week and I went in there faded and
the worst president in the world is a

1212
01:10:15,951 --> 01:10:20,590
drunk with a customer service issue.
I was the worst to how drunk were you?

1213
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,300
I was drunk enough to,

1214
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,660
or I'm worried that
they'll hack into my shit.

1215
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:33,970
Oh, that's hilarious. It was pretty,
I feel bad about it. I was just like,

1216
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,030
cause the dude, they weren't helpful.
I have missed my appointment.

1217
01:10:37,031 --> 01:10:40,420
I had a 1230 appointment, I popped
in at two. It gave me a new phone.

1218
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:42,970
Okay.

1219
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:47,230
How's the worst? His name was, hey
Suze. And I was like, come on, Jesus.

1220
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:51,580
And we were going back and forth.
He wasn't, he wasn't great to me,

1221
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:54,690
but he also wasn't, I was being a
dick to, you know what I mean? So,

1222
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:57,250
and also I was drunk.
I felt bad about it.

1223
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:02,500
I felt bad about it the next day. God
dammit, I'm an apple store via drug.

1224
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,430
They must get drunk people all the time
at apple stores? Probably, I mean, yeah.

1225
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:09,790
Now 24 hour apple, our apple
store, they used to outside. Yeah.

1226
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:12,060
If you getting your iPhone fixed
at four o'clock in the morning,

1227
01:11:12,061 --> 01:11:14,040
you gotta be fucked up.
Yeah. Cause you get an

1228
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,800
activated iPhone and four o'clock in
the morning. Can they activate it?

1229
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:19,170
Iphone at four o'clock
could I want to do that?

1230
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:25,730
Uh, yeah, it's a 24 hour uh, apple store.

1231
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:30,350
Cause I had to get a new laptop last week.
So at 25 apple store, 24 hour best bus.

1232
01:11:30,351 --> 01:11:33,680
So I did my shopping late,
went and got a computer,

1233
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,160
went to best buy grout,
Xbox one late at night.

1234
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,930
Great Shot. Yeah. Yeah, I heard about
the best part. It's 24 our best box.

1235
01:11:40,931 --> 01:11:42,110
That's like near college,
right?

1236
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:46,600
It's a [inaudible] not too far from
Nyu. Yeah. So it's a union square.

1237
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:51,410
That's the one thing that Manhattan has.
It's this 24 hour thing almost.

1238
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,330
You know what they don't have
any more though is pool halls.

1239
01:11:53,331 --> 01:11:55,940
He used to have a 24 hour pool.
I don't think they have that anymore.

1240
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:59,830
Having gone these to have this
place, Chelsea billiards. It was,

1241
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:01,250
there was a quite a few places,

1242
01:12:01,251 --> 01:12:04,760
but Chelsea was the big one that
was open 24 hours a day. Yeah,

1243
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,560
go there at four o'clock in the morning
and you have a big pool guy. Yeah.

1244
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:11,060
I love pool a little about what you think
about trick shot. Full stupid. Really?

1245
01:12:11,061 --> 01:12:13,070
It's pointless. Yeah. I like tricks up.

1246
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:18,860
Pool is like tying a duck to a stick
and shooting it out of the sky.

1247
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:21,870
Yeah, that's what it's like.
The difference between a,

1248
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:23,990
you get to choose your shots.
That's ridiculous.

1249
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:28,010
The whole idea pool is figuring out the
patterns and moving the ball around,

1250
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:31,940
controlling the cue ball,
making shots and and running out.

1251
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,950
Do the table presents you with a problem,
right?

1252
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:35,480
You have to figure out
that problem and get out.

1253
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:38,750
This is some stupid thing that
you practice over and over again,

1254
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,840
so I have to do is just poke at the
stick and the ball's going in the right

1255
01:12:41,841 --> 01:12:44,680
direction because you set
them up. That's dumb. Oh,

1256
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,970
I guess it's good entertainment. TV,
you know what it is. You know what?

1257
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,890
And I understand your thought
process behind it, but
yeah, but you know, I don't,

1258
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:59,160
I don't get to see them practice. Yeah.
You see the shot. I just seen him do it.

1259
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:03,830
Let's go. It does look cool. Don't get me
wrong. I seen trick shots. It looked cool,

1260
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:06,710
but I don't, I've been playing pool for
20 years. I don't know how to do one.

1261
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:10,610
I can't do one trick shot. Like I
played pretty decent, but I can't,

1262
01:13:10,611 --> 01:13:12,800
I don't know any of them.
I have no desire to learn him either.

1263
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:15,530
They just don't make any sense to
me. It's like, who cares? You said,

1264
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:16,820
you know what people do that.

1265
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,610
Like say if a PR professional
came to your pool hall,

1266
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:22,330
it was doing a demonstration. People
like to see trick shots. Yeah.

1267
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,980
Like it'd be higher.
I got like Earl Strickland.

1268
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:27,740
Earl Strickland comes to your
pool hall. He's gonna, you know,

1269
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:31,250
he'll do some trick shots for you. I would
act as you, I'll of course, you know,

1270
01:13:31,251 --> 01:13:35,900
I'm like, you know, pool celebrities
too. We'll get names. Yeah.

1271
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:40,210
Yeah. I get into shit, man.
Yeah. When I'm, when I'm in
the shit, I get into it. Yeah,

1272
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:44,890
you got, you should get pool kills
man. I guess that'd be cool. No,

1273
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:49,000
I mean young business Joe Blow Joe
Rogan Cuckoos Nah, Nah, that's that.

1274
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,780
Probably no pool cues.

1275
01:13:50,781 --> 01:13:54,140
You'll only want to buy from a dude
who actually makes the pool cue.

1276
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,450
There's a thing about pool cue artisans.

1277
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,250
They make pool cues and like when you
buy him from a guy who was like a,

1278
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,630
like a Zen Bodi or a task Arella
like take, we'll have these names.

1279
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:10,010
Like they make these exotic pool cues
out of wood and their craftsmanship and

1280
01:14:10,011 --> 01:14:14,650
they cut them place in precisely.
And it's a big like art form to it.

1281
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,540
Ah, so you wouldn't want
to buy my fucking book.

1282
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:19,620
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
Can't buy a pool cue with my name on it,

1283
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,910
but stupid. You didn't, you'd be an idiot.

1284
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:26,910
You want to buy a southwest,
you know you want to buy a Jean to,

1285
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:31,360
you want to buy cues that have
a name to him. Okay, cool.

1286
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,310
This is like a longstanding art form of,

1287
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:36,250
it's almost like a Samurai sword type
of thing where there's like certain

1288
01:14:36,251 --> 01:14:38,860
artists that are preferred
over other artists.

1289
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,330
Certain the artisans that have a like a
long history passed down from father to

1290
01:14:43,331 --> 01:14:45,850
son. It's very common. Wow. Yeah.

1291
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:50,130
I actually, I mean I'd be
pissed. Why if like, man,

1292
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,000
I don't want to be in a pool.
Cubin

1293
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:58,020
I'm passing on this pool cubit.
I don't even like pull that.

1294
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,830
Well, if you did like pool
then it would be good,

1295
01:15:00,831 --> 01:15:03,560
but if they want it to be a comedian,
I could see your point. Yeah.

1296
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:05,090
Long hours in the shop.

1297
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:09,500
Breathing in fucking saw dust
and glue fumes and shit. Yeah.

1298
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:14,660
Working in a paint booth. One of those
gas masks on. Yeah, that would be,

1299
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:17,290
it's not for Hannibal Burress.
Snapvault isn't.

1300
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:19,220
That for me is not for a lot of people.

1301
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:23,030
It might not be fun at those father son
team. They might not like that shit.

1302
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:26,630
Maybe I would have to talk to
them and just work individually.

1303
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:31,580
I hope I don't get angry white from the
Southwest Pool Cup. I'm sure you would.

1304
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,480
I'm sure there'll be pest.
Yeah. Yeah. There's uh,

1305
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,720
quite a few people that take
that very seriously. Yeah.

1306
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,770
Well are you into anything?
Do you play any games or anything?

1307
01:15:39,771 --> 01:15:43,070
Do you do anything on the road? Do you
bowl? I've got a marble collection.

1308
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:47,710
I don't have a marble collection. I
played video games a little bit. I'm a,

1309
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,020
but I'm trying to think of
my other stuff that I do.

1310
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:54,100
I'm a pretty pretty bar in dope man.

1311
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:57,790
I'd play video games, do
comedy, go to concerts.

1312
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:01,180
And that's pretty much it.
Yeah.

1313
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:05,170
Keep track of my frequent
flyer miles. Very, uh, heavily

1314
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:08,940
no. How boring stuff. How hardcore
do you get with the video games?

1315
01:16:08,941 --> 01:16:11,670
Do you actually bring console with you
on the road? Are you one of those dudes?

1316
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,580
No, I can't do that. There's a lot
of dudes and get crazy with that.

1317
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,010
Yeah.
Cause it's not because it makes it more,

1318
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:21,460
it makes it more exciting for when I get
back home. Cause that Kinda is how I,

1319
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:24,990
you know, I'm really at home if I'm
sitting at home playing video games,

1320
01:16:24,991 --> 01:16:29,460
if I've been gone for 10 days, like
all right relax, I'm home, play a game.

1321
01:16:29,461 --> 01:16:34,230
So that's, that's the thing. I, I leave
the game at home. It's a good move.

1322
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:37,070
But I get into it.
I only played two games.

1323
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:41,220
Gta and NBA Two k 14.
That's it.

1324
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,353
That's pretty much it.

1325
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:45,570
Cause I'm always gone so I
don't have time to you switching

1326
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:50,160
games. Yeah. I want to get some skills,
learn the game and then enjoy it.

1327
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:55,490
Shoes is learning a new game. I might
try out this titan fall. I got that, uh,

1328
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:57,140
for the Xbox while I
haven't played it yet.

1329
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:58,920
I keep hearing incredible things.
Yeah.

1330
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:02,450
People have like emailed
me if you thinking about
getting back into video games,

1331
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:05,360
this is the video game to get back into
with. I'm like, get the fuck away from me.

1332
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:09,020
Yeah. And that's the thing. So you
don't have time to play, but you got,

1333
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:12,470
so you got a lot of work and I was
thinking about that too when I'm playing

1334
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:14,410
because I can't play for three
or four hours straight limit.

1335
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,330
I should I be playing this or
should I be writing a script?

1336
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:21,860
Should I really be playing against this
13 year old like talking shit to him?

1337
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:25,760
I don't talk shit. I might send that.
I might if they talk cause I don't,

1338
01:17:25,761 --> 01:17:27,120
I can't have a strain.
I can't,

1339
01:17:27,121 --> 01:17:30,620
I don't put on the headset when it's
a strain that can just have a stranger

1340
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:33,200
having that much access
to my brain like that.

1341
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,990
I already already do that with Twitter.
I can't have their voice.

1342
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:39,510
Right. Yeah. Could you imagine
if that's the new Twitter,

1343
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:44,540
if people just to be able to anonymously
talk shit to you right to nowhere.

1344
01:17:44,551 --> 01:17:47,400
Yeah. Just like a, you can get
your APP mentions on Twitter.

1345
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,620
If you could just get
like one after the other,

1346
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:53,520
a bunch of people talking shit
in your hair, your glasses.
We'll smudge. Don't TV.

1347
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:54,900
Good.
She looks stupid.

1348
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:59,930
Well, cost of sneakers are those. Where'd
you get that jacket? That was suck, man.

1349
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:03,800
I delete. You know what, I delete my
Twitter app sometimes just cause I,

1350
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:06,080
I spend too much time on it.
D really?

1351
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:09,590
But then I ended up putting it back
on like two days later. But I do,

1352
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:11,990
but the Times that I'm
trying to have like,

1353
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:17,040
and I'm going to try to two hours a day.
Why?

1354
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:20,300
Just unplugged to awake hours a day

1355
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,860
while unplugged. Like
no computer, no phone.

1356
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:29,450
So I either rewrite or workout
or just talk or just chill.

1357
01:18:29,451 --> 01:18:32,900
But no looking at the phone, no
email, no texting, none of that.

1358
01:18:32,901 --> 01:18:36,800
So that's what I'm trying to do. Just
because I found when my phone was broken,

1359
01:18:36,801 --> 01:18:40,100
I had, I didn't have my phone for
a day. It just, it was broken.

1360
01:18:40,101 --> 01:18:43,220
I've found that I was, I was a
little bit more productive. I read,

1361
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:47,300
I read a little bit of a book, I wrote
like six jokes or sobbing and I was,

1362
01:18:47,301 --> 01:18:49,130
I felt uh,
uh,

1363
01:18:49,131 --> 01:18:53,300
way more clearheaded because I
wasn't just checking peoples.

1364
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,400
You weren't tethered.
I wasn't tethered.

1365
01:18:55,401 --> 01:19:00,080
I wasn't checking Twitter obsessively
and compulsively and yeah.

1366
01:19:00,081 --> 01:19:01,700
So that that's what,
that's why new shit.

1367
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:05,340
Yeah. I get tethered to that fucking
phone man. It's weird. It's tough.

1368
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:09,010
It's weird when you're out and you just
have this desire to check your email for

1369
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:12,940
no reason. What the fuck like, like it's
nothing that important in the email.

1370
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:14,780
Cause if it was it'd be a phone call.
Yeah.

1371
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,980
Especially when you know you're not
in the middle of doing anything.

1372
01:19:17,981 --> 01:19:21,430
It's not like you're like a deal's
about to go down. Alright Hannibal,

1373
01:19:21,431 --> 01:19:23,730
stay near the phone. We're
going to call on. You said that

1374
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:26,680
even if it was going down,
isn't that going away?

1375
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:31,060
Is that going away and a dealer's going
to go down but you didn't get back to us

1376
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:33,590
back to us in 20 minutes.

1377
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:36,920
We thought you one of the most hilarious
guys of all time in a future superstar.

1378
01:19:36,921 --> 01:19:40,430
But time is as the essence
time is of the essence.

1379
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:46,280
We just called some other dude that we
had on our list of guys whose day to make

1380
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:49,250
and he checks his phone all the time.

1381
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:52,250
It does get like that though when
it's casting, when they get casting,

1382
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:56,420
when it gets down to casting calls,
whether or not you agree to take a show,

1383
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,630
like they give you a offer and as a
counter offer they have offers on someone

1384
01:19:59,631 --> 01:20:02,100
else and then you know, it
was like a backup offer. Well,

1385
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:03,500
if animal gets crazy with the money,

1386
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:07,380
we've got this dude wait in the windows
there is that. They'd dealt that'll,

1387
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:08,070
that'll

1388
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,360
definitely keeping near your phone.
Yeah,

1389
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,080
but that's another beautiful
thing about the internet.

1390
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:17,280
It's like that shit we were talking about
like he used to need a show like guys

1391
01:20:17,281 --> 01:20:19,120
used to go away.
If they didn't have a shelf,

1392
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,660
they didn't have something to
put them out there to the crowd.

1393
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:26,070
That's all gone away. Now you get
your own show. If you want to do,

1394
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,820
you're great at podcasting.
You could just start a fucking podcast.

1395
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:32,940
I thought about starting a podcast.
Totally. Should do a podcast.

1396
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:35,670
You would have a hilarious podcast,
but you had a podcast.

1397
01:20:35,671 --> 01:20:39,390
I would for sure download that shit.
I subscribe to it 100%

1398
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:44,570
I actually recorded six
episodes of a podcast.

1399
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:49,160
It was called talking to strangers and
I just talked to legit people that the

1400
01:20:49,161 --> 01:20:53,030
people that had never met before or
that they weren't in comedy at all.

1401
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,800
That's a great idea.
But then now,

1402
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:57,980
I mean that would be me driving
the listenership every time.

1403
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:01,370
Yeah. Which is, you know,

1404
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:05,770
but still bill bird does a podcast where
he just talks by himself. Just him.

1405
01:21:05,771 --> 01:21:09,340
Renton. So does Greg Proops.
Greg does it alive. One,

1406
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:12,970
he does a show called the smartest man
in the world. Yeah. It's hilarious.

1407
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:17,620
Just him and he doesn't ask questions and
he does a lot of questions that mother

1408
01:21:17,621 --> 01:21:20,410
fucker could like no one.
Yeah, Greg Proops can,

1409
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:24,010
he can just go and he's smart as fuck.

1410
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:28,090
So he has like hours of information and
has had the dude has so much information

1411
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:30,300
in his head. Like he went on
a rant about Columbus. Like,

1412
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:33,640
I've read a bunch of shit about Columbus.
I knew quite a bit about Columbus,

1413
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:38,800
but Greg Proops went on this mad rant
explaining what a cunt Columbus really was

1414
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:41,830
fucking evil.
You know those people were back then.

1415
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:45,680
Yeah, you can be evil back then
because there was no Twitter.

1416
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:50,930
There can be evil and unchecked.
Facebook,

1417
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:56,020
no Facebook, nobody like evil
Emma Evil Shit. Nah Shit.

1418
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:57,063
Chill out.

1419
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:02,260
Go on business holding a baby in one hand,
a sword.

1420
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:07,670
You can just be evil because you just
had you an evil and you add to four

1421
01:22:07,671 --> 01:22:11,840
friends who also evil
enablers of life being evil.

1422
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:14,290
Isn't that funny that that is the case,
the,

1423
01:22:14,291 --> 01:22:16,100
especially when you get to a new land,

1424
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:20,150
like you getting a wooden boat and he
traveled to this half of the world where

1425
01:22:20,151 --> 01:22:23,480
it's going right in your eyes.
Completely wild, right. You know,

1426
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:26,240
and they can come up with
all sorts of justifications,

1427
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:29,090
why they should just start murdering
people and then they find out these people

1428
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:32,000
have gold. Oh Shit. Yeah.

1429
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:36,830
How's it been so easy to be evil back
then? You're actually right. Yeah.

1430
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:38,960
Twitter keeps people from being as evil.

1431
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:44,720
Well in Italian and attainers will
common called Columbus and entertainer.

1432
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,820
But that's what I'm saying.
It wouldn't, I mean,

1433
01:22:46,821 --> 01:22:50,310
I don't know if he would have
been effective at whatever
it is something funny

1434
01:22:50,311 --> 01:22:50,990
to think about,

1435
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:55,990
but yet it is crazy just just to be just
that type of that mind state that so

1436
01:22:57,711 --> 01:23:01,760
long ago it, we're going to this
place and we're gonna do some shit.

1437
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:03,320
I Dunno if what we're doing

1438
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,790
well, it's notorious when
someone shows up in a boat,

1439
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:11,380
like this is probably the only time in
human history that when a boat full of

1440
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:13,480
strangers shows up in your store,

1441
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:17,200
people aren't going to die every
other time in human history.

1442
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:21,550
Once that boat showed up,
most likely people were fucking dying.

1443
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:25,900
Most likely some terrible shit's going
to get down some crazy desperadoes who

1444
01:23:25,901 --> 01:23:27,160
are starving to death.

1445
01:23:27,161 --> 01:23:30,160
I'm going to hop off that boat and
they're going to have swords and bows and

1446
01:23:30,161 --> 01:23:33,610
arrows and canons and they're going
to go cause they're hungry. Fuck yeah,

1447
01:23:33,611 --> 01:23:36,400
they're hungry. There's
that. Scurvy is no pussy.

1448
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:39,540
They're eating rats and
fucking old rice. I mean, what?

1449
01:23:39,541 --> 01:23:41,170
What are they going to do when they
get off their, they're going to,

1450
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:44,200
they're going to take whatever they want.
They're gonna, they're gonna go crazy.

1451
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:45,760
Especially when there's no Twitter.

1452
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:50,820
Yeah. Notes later to say, hey man,
chill a chill out on the pillaging.

1453
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:52,670
I get the last hundred years.

1454
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:57,630
Probably the only time where it's not a
terrifying moment when a boat pulls up

1455
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:02,220
every other time before that, the 17
hundreds or whatever it was, what,

1456
01:24:02,221 --> 01:24:06,360
1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue,
all that shit.

1457
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:10,110
That was a terrible time when someone
pulled up in a boat. Terrible time. Boats.

1458
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:14,940
A like, yeah. Tanks and then
tanks. Now when tanks pull up,

1459
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:18,060
something bad is happening or it was
happening or it was about to happen.

1460
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:22,240
Exactly. A battleship.
Yeah. Yeah. That's all

1461
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:22,781
law.

1462
01:24:22,781 --> 01:24:25,900
Do you think they knew that something
terrible was going to happen right away?

1463
01:24:25,901 --> 01:24:28,360
Or was it they were, they
were open at first, right?

1464
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:30,550
Well, did you ever see that
movie? There's a movie. Um,

1465
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:32,900
I think it's what the bleep do
we know that try, I think it's,

1466
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,700
this movie tries to present this argument.

1467
01:24:34,701 --> 01:24:38,690
They think that the native Americans
might not have even been able to see the

1468
01:24:38,691 --> 01:24:43,430
boat because they had no point of
reference, which is stupid as fuck. To me,

1469
01:24:43,431 --> 01:24:46,910
that would make no sense because there's
a lot of unique events that you only

1470
01:24:46,911 --> 01:24:49,940
see for the first time. I like the idea
that they wouldn't be able to see it.

1471
01:24:49,941 --> 01:24:52,160
It's,
I think it's just some woo woo bullshit.

1472
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:55,850
I think it's some nonscientific bullshit
that some people try to pass off.

1473
01:24:55,940 --> 01:25:00,530
That's my take on it as a nonscientific
bullshit artist. Yeah. But, uh,

1474
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:04,130
I think they wouldn't have known what
the fucker was if they had never seen a

1475
01:25:04,131 --> 01:25:08,680
boat before. And then all of a sudden,
like when the conquistadores landed, the,

1476
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:12,620
the, the people who live like the Aztecs
thought that they were gods because they

1477
01:25:12,621 --> 01:25:15,920
never seen a person on a horse before.
They'd never seen that.

1478
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:19,310
They didn't know what the fuck was going
on. They saw these people on horses.

1479
01:25:19,311 --> 01:25:21,920
They thought the horse was a part of them.
They thought they were gods.

1480
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:23,990
I didn't never seen anything before.
It's crazy.

1481
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:28,460
They think that a one point in time,
most of North America did not have horses.

1482
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:31,340
The horses were brought
here from somewhere else.

1483
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:34,280
So the native American Indians didn't
use to have horses in the beginning.

1484
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:35,621
Wow.
Wait.

1485
01:25:35,621 --> 01:25:40,450
So they brought horses on these boats
or horses came from somewhere else. Wow.

1486
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:43,000
So horse,
that was horrible boat ride.

1487
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:48,700
Cause you talking about days and days
with a horse with a horse weeks and

1488
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,760
feeding weeks,
probably

1489
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:51,670
months,
right?

1490
01:25:51,671 --> 01:25:55,000
I mean how long did it take for Columbus
to get from Spain to The Bahamas?

1491
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:58,840
I don't know. I don't know
how to be months. I would
imagine it would be months,

1492
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,820
months of travel.
Monster travel makes sense.

1493
01:26:00,821 --> 01:26:04,070
When you're on a boat that has to
get blown around by the wind. You're

1494
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,650
trying to get across the biggest
body of water known to man,

1495
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:08,540
that Shit's ridiculous. Uh, ocean,

1496
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:11,240
you gotta get across the ocean
on a floating piece of a tree.

1497
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:14,320
That's the stupidest fucking thing
I've ever heard. So did you go

1498
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:15,283
deal with horses?

1499
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:18,800
So do you get to take everything was
you think he just felt inside out?

1500
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:20,810
Just like man,
it was as loud as fuck.

1501
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:23,160
I think people back then were ruthless.

1502
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:27,600
I think they were dealing with completely
different times. People died younger.

1503
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:30,930
The, the amount of time you were
on this planet was very short.

1504
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,750
The average person didn't
get their shit together.

1505
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:36,600
30 30 something you liked about it.
Was it,

1506
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:38,550
I mean there was a few
people that live longer,

1507
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:41,640
but most people probably
died off at 30 well,

1508
01:26:41,641 --> 01:26:46,100
and also the infant mortality rate
was so high that it lowers the, the,

1509
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:49,440
the average age of death.
It lowers it because of that.

1510
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:51,690
Like an infant mortality
was through the roof.

1511
01:26:51,691 --> 01:26:54,930
It was like 50% of the kids would die
back then. Like during the Roman times,

1512
01:26:54,931 --> 01:26:58,200
I believe it was 50% child mortality rain.
He had two kids.

1513
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:03,270
One would be dead for sure. He's, yeah.
And that's normal. That was normal.

1514
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:06,810
So I think their,
their whole idea of like what,

1515
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:10,110
what's violent and what's
evil, what's good, what's bad.

1516
01:27:10,111 --> 01:27:13,710
It was just completely different.
They were used to way more barbarism,

1517
01:27:13,711 --> 01:27:17,240
way more murder, weight, the weight,
you know, they would Mary Antoinette,

1518
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:17,490
they would,

1519
01:27:17,490 --> 01:27:21,240
they would fucking think about when
they would have those gigantic town

1520
01:27:21,241 --> 01:27:24,960
executions and they would use the gay
teen cut someone's fucking head off in the

1521
01:27:24,961 --> 01:27:27,660
town square.
We just think that people used to do that.

1522
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:30,430
That was, that is, that
is, that is pretty. But

1523
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:35,270
like we like now to Getty is kind of,
you know,

1524
01:27:35,271 --> 01:27:39,860
used as a joke in movies on stuff
like, yeah, the kids eat. But yeah,

1525
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:42,710
the fact that that was real is insane.

1526
01:27:42,870 --> 01:27:46,440
It was real and it removed your head
and you were conscious for a few minutes

1527
01:27:46,441 --> 01:27:51,270
for you before you would die, your
head would be separated from your body,

1528
01:27:51,271 --> 01:27:52,470
your body would be dying.

1529
01:27:52,710 --> 01:27:56,360
But as the oxygen in your brain is
slowly leaking out like you are your

1530
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:58,140
conscious for probably not a few minutes,

1531
01:27:58,141 --> 01:28:00,660
but probably at least a
few seconds we'll use it.

1532
01:28:00,661 --> 01:28:04,140
Man has fucked up looking up at
a basket and you're like, oh,

1533
01:28:04,141 --> 01:28:08,310
you gotta be fucking kidding. I
didn't do anything that bad. When you,

1534
01:28:08,311 --> 01:28:11,610
all you gotta do was pick the wrong
person off that had power and they would

1535
01:28:11,611 --> 01:28:15,000
just be off with their head.
It would just off with your hand.

1536
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:16,020
That was like a common thing.

1537
01:28:16,270 --> 01:28:19,090
Can we talk, can we talk it through
a little bit? You need any work, work

1538
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,490
done? No. Oh,

1539
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:24,780
it isn't it funny too that they
would do that shit publicly.

1540
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,650
Like that's what we avoid now. We don't
want the public even seeing coffins. Yeah.

1541
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:31,980
Like you're not allowed to take
photographs of a coffins of veterans when

1542
01:28:31,981 --> 01:28:36,090
they're coming back. Yeah. The Bush
administration made that illegal,

1543
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:38,010
which is kind of fucking crazy.

1544
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:41,010
You're not even allowed to see a
picture of someone who dies at war.

1545
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:44,310
Forget about c like a
prisoner getting executed.

1546
01:28:44,311 --> 01:28:48,450
You know a lot to see any of
that shit. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

1547
01:28:48,451 --> 01:28:50,970
I don't want to see that
prisoner getting executed.

1548
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:58,290
If I sent you a link, you'd click it.
If I sent you a link and it says, uh,

1549
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:01,350
you know, okay, let's just think
of someone just undeniably,

1550
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:07,890
uh, Hitler. Okay. If I sent you a link and
it, dude, you want to watch this video?

1551
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:10,090
This is a Hitler getting executed.
How's he getting executed?

1552
01:29:10,091 --> 01:29:14,450
It's going to get his head cut off
the sword. What mental state am I in?

1553
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:19,350
Sova junk. Hi. Uh, depends on when
you get home. Uh, saying the email.

1554
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:20,213
7:00 PM.

1555
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,570
What other emails do I have?

1556
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:29,390
And you had some new information about
your standup comedy special and to be out

1557
01:29:29,391 --> 01:29:30,290
on comedy central.

1558
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:33,680
Yeah. On a, yeah, it's out on
comedy central direct right now.

1559
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:37,060
It comes out midnight on a
Saturday on comedy central. Yeah.

1560
01:29:37,061 --> 01:29:42,050
Some information about that or,
or the Hitler thing. Oh yeah.

1561
01:29:42,051 --> 01:29:42,884
Click that Shit,
man.

1562
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:47,400
Yeah, I'd click it to, I've clicked on
some shit. I shouldn't have clicked. Yeah.

1563
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:49,030
The most recent one was um,

1564
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:54,390
some Mexican dude cut in his girlfriend's
head off or cheating one of the drug

1565
01:29:54,521 --> 01:29:56,940
lords.
Like it's,

1566
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:01,660
it's so obviously real as fuck.
So obviously really good.

1567
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,430
His boys will,
who's filming it?

1568
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:07,450
His friends. Yeah. It was one of
the cartel guys as crazy. You know,

1569
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:09,110
there's some crazy cartel videos,

1570
01:30:09,111 --> 01:30:12,300
just cartel videos and I'm using chain
saws and cut and dude's heads off,

1571
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:13,980
but almost,
I mean,

1572
01:30:13,981 --> 01:30:17,640
I know how fucked up it is to cut your
girlfriend's head off of cheating,

1573
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,500
but in that you almost
understand. No, no, no.

1574
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:25,560
I'm talking about in their world where
he's all about Latin machismo. Yeah.

1575
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:30,630
It also be a cartel leader and your
girlfriend and everybody knowing this,

1576
01:30:30,901 --> 01:30:35,130
he cheated.
Like he has to maintain his Kartell Shit.

1577
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:38,910
That's true. If you're going to be
awful, it's awful. Nobody's bugging.

1578
01:30:38,911 --> 01:30:42,210
Say Annabelle condones
beheading of cheating too late,

1579
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:45,810
like know the right and the
salon.com right now, but

1580
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:52,440
part of rape culture.
But that is that as is saying.

1581
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:54,090
Do you have that up there?
I'm glad I didn't look.

1582
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:57,240
Uh, we didn't have it up. Yeah, no,
no, we're not going to show you.

1583
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:01,050
I don't want to see that shit.
Yeah, but that's, that's it. Cut.

1584
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:05,100
He did a knife as recent. Oh
yeah. It's hard to watch, man.

1585
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:06,660
It's really hard to walk.
Then you hold her head up.

1586
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:11,400
The reason she was cheating is because
he was so busy running the carts.

1587
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:16,950
I don't know what their history was.
What? I'm assuming he's in the wrong.

1588
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:22,240
I'm sure running a card sale is very
time consuming and Sud needed some Dick.

1589
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,140
He's still,
it doesn't mean that she didn't love him.

1590
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:29,220
Yeah. I would say the same. If I was
there while this argument was going down,

1591
01:31:29,221 --> 01:31:33,090
he's like, I'm going to cut her fucking
head off. Like, dude, relax. You come on,

1592
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:37,590
she's, she appreciates you. Let's kick it
was, she was just needed some attention.

1593
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:41,640
She needed a little Dick. Come
on. Now let's look at it this way.

1594
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:44,080
You got to fucking green light cheat.
However you,

1595
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:46,290
they actually have the
green light and the cartel.

1596
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:48,930
They just do whatever the fuck they
want. But yeah, at this point in time,

1597
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:51,790
I mean how much money those
guys have their, I mean they,

1598
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:55,860
they have cartels where the, the head guys
have like $1 billion. Like, yeah, this,

1599
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,050
it's like make Al Capone look ridiculous.

1600
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,100
Are we in

1601
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:04,500
danger of being attacked by the
cartel now? I don't think so.

1602
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,560
I don't think they've ever developed
like real legitimate military power.

1603
01:32:07,561 --> 01:32:11,210
But what they have developed as
local power, like they don't have no,

1604
01:32:11,211 --> 01:32:15,000
I mean me and you as individuals. No, we
haven't said anything bad. Oh, okay. Cool.

1605
01:32:15,001 --> 01:32:16,920
What did we said bad? I don't
know. They make a lot of money.

1606
01:32:16,921 --> 01:32:19,040
They don't tolerate
cheating. All right. Yeah.

1607
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:24,420
So are we kind of cartel propaganda?
That's interesting.

1608
01:32:24,421 --> 01:32:27,780
If we were probably, if we
were cartel sympathizers, yeah,

1609
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:31,680
but I don't think we are. I don't
think so. I think what we are is, look,

1610
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:34,950
the whole reason why cartels exists,
but we were talking about earlier,

1611
01:32:34,951 --> 01:32:38,070
should cocaine be legal?
We'll have cocaine's not legal.

1612
01:32:38,071 --> 01:32:41,130
Who's going to sell it because people were
going to smoke it, snort it, smoke it,

1613
01:32:41,131 --> 01:32:44,730
whatever they do with it, shoot it. Some
people shoot it, they're going to do it.

1614
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:47,280
They're going to do it. Who's
going to profit? Right? Criminals.

1615
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:52,110
Is it better to have Pfizer or sell coke
or is it better to have the, the, the,

1616
01:32:52,111 --> 01:32:56,930
the mafia down in Pfizer. I say
Pfizer, I say led Pfizer profit off.

1617
01:32:56,990 --> 01:33:01,880
So Joe was just saying is
that if Kokei was legal,

1618
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:03,710
this woman was still be alive.

1619
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:06,490
You know what,
you might have a point there

1620
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:10,880
I think. I mean, it's a long way
to go, but it does. You know,

1621
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:15,740
I think that's what it is.
Well, I definitely think
some people would be alive.

1622
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:18,080
Yeah. There would be less
violence, less violence.

1623
01:33:18,081 --> 01:33:22,310
It'd be less money
spent in jails on jails.

1624
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:27,670
Don in Portugal is a clear indicator
that we're on the wrong path with,

1625
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:30,450
with keeping everything
illegal and locking people up,

1626
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:33,060
putting private prisons up,
throwing people in.

1627
01:33:33,061 --> 01:33:35,760
They're profiting off the fact
they're in their Portugal.

1628
01:33:35,761 --> 01:33:38,090
They've lowered everything.
They've lowered the rates of addiction.

1629
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:39,570
They've lowered violent crime.

1630
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:44,130
They lower the amount of money they have
to spend on legal fees and courts and

1631
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:48,150
prisons. They load all that shit
just by decriminalizing all drugs.

1632
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:52,260
They just made it so that people aren't
fucking locked up as criminals anymore.

1633
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:57,360
Yeah. For a choice, choose alcohol,
which will fuck you up, man.

1634
01:33:57,890 --> 01:34:01,530
You and I. Okay. Listen, I was
in the apple store last week,

1635
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:05,730
trust me, but we could get
fucked up in like 20 minutes.

1636
01:34:06,150 --> 01:34:08,160
Jamie could go back there,
breakout some whiskey,

1637
01:34:08,161 --> 01:34:10,890
and we could just start doing
shots within 15 minutes.

1638
01:34:10,891 --> 01:34:12,920
We would be unrecognizable.
Right.

1639
01:34:14,490 --> 01:34:18,510
You could get fucked up in like a short
amount of time with alcoholic or really

1640
01:34:18,511 --> 01:34:19,710
short amount of time.
Yeah.

1641
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:24,810
Why is that legal and coke stock
by arbitrary. Completely arbitrary.

1642
01:34:24,811 --> 01:34:28,530
It doesn't make no logical sense.
There's no, it doesn't make sense.

1643
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:32,460
The same type of person who would go on
a coat bench will also go on a drunken

1644
01:34:32,461 --> 01:34:33,480
rampage.
Yeah.

1645
01:34:34,530 --> 01:34:35,020
Okay.

1646
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:38,590
Well you can't go on a coke
rampage. You go on both. Okay.

1647
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,410
You can go on a a drunken binge.
Yeah, you can go on a drunken rampage.

1648
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:46,170
You can go on a coke binge
or a coke rampage. Yeah.

1649
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:47,740
Okay.

1650
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:52,060
But I agree. I agree with you. I'd rather
be around the guy on coke. So there, well,

1651
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:56,410
here you go. You got to a
drunk, you know, drunk problem.

1652
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:59,360
Americans got a giant drunk problem.
We've got alcohol everywhere.

1653
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:00,650
People die of alcohol,

1654
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,520
but the hundreds of thousands
Savis [inaudible] all that shit.

1655
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:09,590
What's better though? Coke drivers or
drunk drivers? I don't know man. I think,

1656
01:35:10,430 --> 01:35:15,230
uh, I don't know. I don't notice.
That's man. If you had to guess,

1657
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:18,770
if I had to guess, would you rather be in
a car with a dude? Is coked up or dude,

1658
01:35:18,771 --> 01:35:20,630
he's drunk and he's driving.
I think

1659
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:23,080
the cooktop, dude, we'll be driving fast,

1660
01:35:23,081 --> 01:35:26,080
but he'll make those lanes
shifts like a mother.

1661
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:33,263
He'll be,

1662
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:43,860
he'll be pulling right into parking spots
that you'd normally have to parallel

1663
01:35:43,861 --> 01:35:46,710
and so he just pulled
right in tight spots.

1664
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:51,990
Slide two. Let's open up a driving
business. I'm fucking awesome.

1665
01:35:52,510 --> 01:35:55,590
[inaudible] we had to do cool drivers.
Cool man. When I was kid, I pass it.

1666
01:35:55,591 --> 01:35:59,310
The first time I tried I had to
written shit. The driver's shit.

1667
01:35:59,311 --> 01:36:01,530
I got all the information at
the knowledge. My got books.

1668
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:05,970
I just need $100,000 come on man.
Let's do this. Let's make money.

1669
01:36:05,971 --> 01:36:08,400
Let's make money. Would be under year.
Come on man. We'll get some bitches.

1670
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:12,270
Great. Yeah, he definitely,

1671
01:36:12,271 --> 01:36:15,570
I would talk to the coke guy first and
I would drive with the coke guy first.

1672
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:16,500
Look at that.

1673
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:21,270
Philoso I would, what am, I would
probably try to drive to, but that was,

1674
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:22,260
that fucks up everything.

1675
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:24,790
Oh, I would definitely
drive if I had the option,

1676
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:27,820
it would be the guy driving over
the drunk driver or the coke driver.

1677
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:32,110
Oh definitely. Yeah. But
if you couldn't drive for,

1678
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:37,380
I'm injured and I need somebody to take
me to the hospital and only only person

1679
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,540
is the coke for an audit drunk friend
Coke Fran. It's taken me to the hospital.

1680
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:41,080
Yeah.

1681
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:44,440
Or you're on the walking dead and you
get picked up on the side of the road and

1682
01:36:44,441 --> 01:36:48,880
you're just happy. It's not a zombie
dude is on coke. You got it wrote. Yeah,

1683
01:36:48,881 --> 01:36:52,530
I would definitely, if I had to
fight zombies, you'd want to do some,

1684
01:36:52,531 --> 01:36:57,531
I want to do this on coke with me
fighting zombies viewed on PCP a PCP.

1685
01:36:58,061 --> 01:37:00,070
Yeah. That's the kind. That's
the mother fucker you want.

1686
01:37:00,490 --> 01:37:04,330
But he would make your rational choices.
What about they do?

1687
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:06,280
They do crazy shit,
but he'd be all right.

1688
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:09,540
He had a string or met somebody
on maths fighting zombies.

1689
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:13,560
That's a good move to which is like an
accelerated version of Adderall. Yeah.

1690
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,190
Really? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Yeah.

1691
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:20,880
Somehow or another related Adderall
put the teeth. The teeth part.

1692
01:37:20,881 --> 01:37:23,820
That's the real accelerated teeth part.
The teeth thing.

1693
01:37:24,450 --> 01:37:27,780
What do you mean teeth thing and
the destroying your face thing. Oh,

1694
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:31,930
we would met with math. Yeah. Oh yeah.
Rots your teeth out. Brushing teeth out.

1695
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:34,200
Just any form of speed.
Once they started doing speed,

1696
01:37:34,230 --> 01:37:38,640
I think they forget to brush too.
That's part of it. If I were to just,

1697
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,970
[inaudible] is a real avid.

1698
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:44,610
I haven't done that much research on
math because it hasn't affected my life

1699
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:46,880
that much. Isn't that messed up? Let me,

1700
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:50,670
sometimes I restart stuff that hasn't
had to deal with me, but meth mouth is a,

1701
01:37:50,671 --> 01:37:52,320
is a real is a real issue,

1702
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:55,920
dude. It's in Wikipedia.
You're 100% right. Meth mouth

1703
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:59,940
as is a turn by itself.
It is. Look, I'm lucky.

1704
01:37:59,950 --> 01:38:03,450
Pedia oh, it's horrible. Yeah.

1705
01:38:03,451 --> 01:38:05,130
Go to meth mouth on Wiki,

1706
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:08,920
so I don't think there's anything called
Adderall mouth that's just dry mouth.

1707
01:38:08,921 --> 01:38:11,850
Do you drink a lot of water and
hydrate yourself? You embed a hill.

1708
01:38:12,030 --> 01:38:16,140
This is insane. Oh my
God. Sent in addition,

1709
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:21,090
characterized by severe decay and loss
of teeth as well as fracture and namel

1710
01:38:21,091 --> 01:38:23,010
erosion and other oral problems.

1711
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:28,260
Symptomatic of extended use of the drug.
Methamphetamine,

1712
01:38:28,410 --> 01:38:30,600
the specific cause that
condition is unknown.

1713
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:34,850
Although drug induced Zeros,

1714
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:40,110
zero stoma,
zero stomion Xerostomia or dry mouth.

1715
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:42,150
Why don't just call it dry mouth.
Why you gotta get crafty?

1716
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:46,620
Something I can't even
pronounce as well as Bruxism,

1717
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:50,700
which is grinding of the teeth. I thought
to be involved. Wow, this is crazy.

1718
01:38:50,701 --> 01:38:55,200
They grind their own fucking teeth off.
That picture is a classic meth mouth.

1719
01:38:55,630 --> 01:38:57,270
You could tell by looking
at the other teeth,

1720
01:38:58,020 --> 01:38:59,790
a person isn't even that fucking old.

1721
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:04,290
They just did some crazy shit to their
teeth. Yeah, I hope to party was awesome.

1722
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:08,340
Poor nutrition, eating too much
sugar, lack of dental hygiene,

1723
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:10,770
common among longterm uses of the drugs.

1724
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,310
I didn't know that meth users eat a lot
of sugar, but that totally makes sense.

1725
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:20,890
The legitimacy of meth mouth as a unique
condition has been questioned because

1726
01:39:20,891 --> 01:39:24,640
of the similar effects of
some other drugs on the teeth.

1727
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:26,590
Treating meth mouth is difficult.

1728
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:32,080
Yeah. Cause your teeth are
gone. You can't, but that's
the best treatment for math.

1729
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:34,710
Math is uh,
veneers.

1730
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:39,610
Yeah. You'd have to just chew them all
down and get some dental implants. Teeth,

1731
01:39:39,670 --> 01:39:44,090
some bulletproof teeth. Yeah, man.
Yeah. You're seeing a person has like a,

1732
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:47,350
like a tooth where they do the
route they the gentle implant.

1733
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:53,130
No, that does crazy veneers though.
I got TV teeth. You got some,

1734
01:39:53,131 --> 01:39:54,000
uh,
what'd they do?

1735
01:39:54,001 --> 01:39:57,810
They scrape the outside off and put a
beautiful shell these front and far as TV

1736
01:39:57,811 --> 01:40:01,440
teeth. Man, it's a beautiful, let me say
smile. Oh those are pretty, yeah man.

1737
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,840
Did they make him perfect? Is that what
it is? That's how you got him. Yeah.

1738
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:07,190
Cause I had a chipped tooth
then a gap and I was like, man,

1739
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,480
I'm probably going to be on TV
a lot in the next few years.

1740
01:40:09,481 --> 01:40:10,860
Let me fix this real quick.

1741
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:16,020
So I got it fixed in
2011 I got them fixed.

1742
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:19,040
There's something sexy about a really
hot girl with a gap in her teeth.

1743
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:21,940
Something like extra sexy.

1744
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:24,910
I get girls would gaps used to connect
with me and like you got a cap.

1745
01:40:24,911 --> 01:40:28,810
I got a gap. I'm like, not for
long. It doesn't bother me though.

1746
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:31,600
Does it bother you if a pretty girl
has a gap in her teeth? No, not at all.

1747
01:40:31,601 --> 01:40:33,160
Not even a little bit,
right? No, not at all.

1748
01:40:33,161 --> 01:40:35,490
It was just my own thing when I was like,
I'm to be on TV.

1749
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:37,540
I don't want to have cracked teeth on TV,

1750
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:41,750
but a gap is different than snaggle
teeth. Yeah. If there's all,

1751
01:40:41,751 --> 01:40:46,260
they're all snuggled up, my bottom teeth
are kind of snuggle. Yeah, sure. Fine.

1752
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:51,080
One is one that goes back to fucked up.
I'm not going to get it fixed.

1753
01:40:51,081 --> 01:40:53,830
I'm a man. Okay. And my top
ones are, I don't give a shit,

1754
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:59,050
but if I was a girl, yeah. Nobody wants
to look at us. Snaggley tooth mouth girl.

1755
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:03,360
Yeah. It's just a yes. Natalie is.
Yeah. Snaggley is not a good look.

1756
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,160
It's not good when you
get the extra teeth.

1757
01:41:05,730 --> 01:41:08,640
Those weird people that have extra
teeth that pop out of the gums and weird

1758
01:41:08,641 --> 01:41:12,780
spots. Yeah. S It's just, you know,

1759
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:17,430
all men are not created equal.
Why don't we give a fuck? Why?

1760
01:41:17,431 --> 01:41:20,640
Why does anybody care about if someone's
teeth are not perfectly in line?

1761
01:41:20,641 --> 01:41:24,510
Like what is, what part of our brain is
being bothered by the lack of symmetry.

1762
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:27,290
Yeah. It's just, that's what
it is. Is this symmetry. I
don't know what part it is,

1763
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:30,770
but people like symmetry for
the same reason. It might,

1764
01:41:30,771 --> 01:41:32,810
I mean it wouldn't anger me,

1765
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:37,820
but if this painting was like a
little bit off, it's a little bit off.

1766
01:41:37,821 --> 01:41:41,480
The other ones look down point, but
if it was a little bit off, I would,

1767
01:41:41,870 --> 01:41:42,800
I would notice it.

1768
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,510
It would fuck with you.
Fuck with me.

1769
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:49,040
I should tilt Jimi Hendrix noticeably
just to fuck with the next gas. Yeah,

1770
01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:52,410
just leave it there kind of cockeyed
and not say shit about it. Yeah.

1771
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:55,640
I'm going to do that. Don't, don't tell
Adam Carolla I'm going to fuck with them.

1772
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:59,930
I'm going to twist that shit up.
Yeah. So it's just, I think, yeah,

1773
01:41:59,931 --> 01:42:04,490
it's just the human brain likes, you
know, symmetry, symmetry. Perfect.

1774
01:42:04,491 --> 01:42:08,870
Lions you, Yup. Yeah, but why, but why?
I don't know. At a certain point in time,

1775
01:42:08,871 --> 01:42:12,580
logic should take over, but it doesn't,
there's certain shit just looks

1776
01:42:12,830 --> 01:42:16,360
good man. You know? I mean, just
like if somebody got a weird tooth,

1777
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:19,970
it's just the same reason why,
you know, if your car got,

1778
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,680
if your car got hit in the,
in the,

1779
01:42:21,681 --> 01:42:25,580
in the front headlight and smashed in
a little bit, the car still runs well.

1780
01:42:25,581 --> 01:42:27,190
But you want that shit
fixed cause it looks like

1781
01:42:27,210 --> 01:42:32,130
dumb. I agree with you 100%. I'm just
trying to figure out why. Why sit?

1782
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:35,970
We like shit. It looks good man. I know
we do, but in that, why weird, right?

1783
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:40,020
Like are you a car guy? Do
you like cars? I do like cars.

1784
01:42:40,110 --> 01:42:41,220
Like what's your favorite car

1785
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:46,380
view? Faith. Actually
favorite. If they're listening.

1786
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,310
I liked the Lincoln Mkx.

1787
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:53,540
That's a beautiful car. A, yeah. I
liked that. Cuts of spaceship. Yeah,

1788
01:42:53,541 --> 01:42:55,640
I liked that car. And, uh, what else?

1789
01:42:55,670 --> 01:43:00,350
I mean I like some bins
is uh, yeah, it was,

1790
01:43:00,570 --> 01:43:05,030
will pull up the 2014
Mercedes Benz s class,

1791
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:08,360
pull up a picture of this.
This is like a, you know,

1792
01:43:08,361 --> 01:43:11,900
if you think about like the cream of
the crop of like luxury automobiles,

1793
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:15,620
like a Mercedes Benz.
Like there's no ugly Mercedes Benz.

1794
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:19,370
They have a bunch of German scientists
that are fucking trying to figure out

1795
01:43:19,371 --> 01:43:23,930
what the symmetry is. Pull up, go
to do a Google search of silver,

1796
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:28,970
2014 Mercedes Benz s class.
Look out this is there.

1797
01:43:28,971 --> 01:43:32,030
There's something beautiful about
it and escape Lee. Beautiful.

1798
01:43:32,150 --> 01:43:36,770
But when you look at the picture,
like why, like what the fuck is it?

1799
01:43:36,771 --> 01:43:39,230
Like what is it about that
sign? And it's just, yeah,

1800
01:43:39,231 --> 01:43:43,010
it looks slick as fuck of
that. That grill, that's
where it was a big part of it.

1801
01:43:43,670 --> 01:43:44,960
You can't say shit about that car.

1802
01:43:44,961 --> 01:43:48,620
No one could say that's not a good looking
car. Yeah, that's a masterpiece, right?

1803
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:49,090
They,

1804
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:52,880
they designed to make it smooth and
probably if you get in that car and drive

1805
01:43:52,881 --> 01:43:55,570
off your home, mother fucker
was going somewhere. Yeah.

1806
01:43:55,880 --> 01:44:00,560
Someone who sits in that car and they're
ad traffic. That's a guy who was doing,

1807
01:44:00,561 --> 01:44:04,610
or a gal that was doing well.
You have a beautiful car.

1808
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:09,350
Looked at him and he was
Mercedes Benz. The smooth car.
Right. But probably brides.

1809
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:12,410
Well
why does it look good?

1810
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:16,610
Well why some things look good to
you and they don't look good to me.

1811
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:17,840
Like here's something,

1812
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,430
I have a friend who loves those
fucking stupid Mercedes. Uh,

1813
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,590
those bread truck looking things.

1814
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:29,450
Those old school ones are
little square cleanser or the,

1815
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:34,130
what do they called? They look like
a jeep. A jeep. But it's, the bit is,

1816
01:44:34,131 --> 01:44:37,390
I think he's talking about us friends
or some people used to miss tour bus.

1817
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:41,360
Oh No, that one. That put g five.
Yeah, that's the one. I take it back.

1818
01:44:41,390 --> 01:44:42,860
Mercedes doesn't make one AWG we car.

1819
01:44:42,861 --> 01:44:46,910
It's this one that's ugly as far I
wouldn't, I don't like, I guess it's just,

1820
01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:48,950
but sometimes the brand can take over.

1821
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:53,380
It is totally take over it and it should
square as fuck. But people love it. Yeah,

1822
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,790
I mean don't get me wrong, somebody
gave me one. I would drive it.

1823
01:44:55,791 --> 01:45:00,320
I'm sure it's lovely to drive. Mercedes
is their masterpieces of engineering.

1824
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:04,700
But you know, look at that and then
like look at a new range rover.

1825
01:45:04,701 --> 01:45:06,980
You want to look at like a beautiful SUV,

1826
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:11,480
pull up the image of the new range
rover and you see like a futuristic,

1827
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:15,930
beautiful looking SUV. But
it's why, what is it? What is,

1828
01:45:15,970 --> 01:45:18,090
why do I like one or the other?
I've,

1829
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:22,550
I never could figure out what it is that
appeals. I don't know what it is. This,

1830
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,630
it's a, it's this varies by
person. Like I got these shoes,

1831
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:30,890
a company sent me these shoes and they
send me some shoes that look great and

1832
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:33,890
they send me some shoes and I'm like,
what the fuck? I would never wear this.

1833
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:37,030
And so my little cousin,
she was visiting me from college,

1834
01:45:37,031 --> 01:45:38,930
he visited me in New York
last week and I was like,

1835
01:45:38,931 --> 01:45:40,550
look at these ugly fucking shoes.

1836
01:45:40,551 --> 01:45:43,790
They look like if Chester Cheetah
will a prideful and she was like,

1837
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:48,080
those look great.
Those what I want to get those to my boy,

1838
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:50,480
the whole shoes a Austin and I was like,
what the fuck?

1839
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:55,450
And so it's just subjective, you know what
I mean? People, people, you know, people.

1840
01:45:55,610 --> 01:45:58,880
It's just subjective. It's some
people's eyes like different things.

1841
01:45:58,881 --> 01:46:02,360
Some people have different aesthetics
and just taste and that's what it is.

1842
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:04,900
Cause I thought those shoes were
gross and I will never wear,

1843
01:46:04,930 --> 01:46:06,140
I still won't ever wear them,

1844
01:46:06,141 --> 01:46:09,410
but there's some people that might
like those shoes. I thought, yeah,

1845
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:11,960
I'm totally with you.
I always wondered.

1846
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:16,280
I want to see that's a new a look at the
difference between those two. This is,

1847
01:46:16,730 --> 01:46:20,210
this is a boxy in bread truck
and that's a space ship.

1848
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:24,890
That's a beautiful spaceship. Yeah.
I've always wanted to know what you see.

1849
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:30,110
Like anybody, any other person I was, I
assume that everybody sees what I say,

1850
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:30,320
right?

1851
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:34,010
I assume that you know when you're looking
at meth mouth you see the same thing

1852
01:46:34,011 --> 01:46:36,950
I'm looking at when you're
looking at these pictures.
But I don't know. You know,

1853
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:39,770
I really don't know. I'm
just guessing. I mean,

1854
01:46:39,771 --> 01:46:43,910
imagine if you use somebody whose eyes
have you see through somebody and the

1855
01:46:43,911 --> 01:46:46,940
whole world. Completely
different. Totally different vibe.

1856
01:46:46,941 --> 01:46:50,040
What do you mean s c
just as far as the visual

1857
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:54,270
or see as far as how people process
things. Both with the brain.

1858
01:46:54,330 --> 01:46:57,930
What else at totally different.
That's crazy. Oh, do you?

1859
01:46:57,931 --> 01:47:00,000
You'd probably use you smoke
so you probably like God,

1860
01:47:00,001 --> 01:47:01,650
do I look when I move around to other

1861
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:06,450
will you ever see yourself on
video and you're like, Whoa,

1862
01:47:06,451 --> 01:47:08,670
what was that like that?
Oh Shit,

1863
01:47:08,730 --> 01:47:13,140
I was fat then I was a fat day.
Oh Man, I should've got a haircut.

1864
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:17,040
Oh Man. My posture. I
actually, you know it's funny.

1865
01:47:18,050 --> 01:47:19,200
Well My,
I did a,

1866
01:47:19,201 --> 01:47:23,670
I did Letterman a couple of years ago
and I hate it cause my suit is horrible,

1867
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,780
but now he's my suit. Horrible.
But my entrance is sucks.

1868
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:30,140
I walk out on Letterman
and I'm like bounding Alec.

1869
01:47:31,390 --> 01:47:34,810
And I guess the word is no comp.
It means calm.

1870
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:38,430
But isn't that like I don't look hot.
Thought I looked when I was walking out.

1871
01:47:38,431 --> 01:47:41,640
I'm like, yeah, I'm walking out on
Letterman and my mind and I see the video.

1872
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:45,780
Can you pull it up? I seen the
video. I'm like, like it's not,

1873
01:47:45,781 --> 01:47:47,910
it's just like real heavy.
Look at,

1874
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:53,160
maybe I'm over analyzing the too,
but that's sued is horrible.

1875
01:47:53,510 --> 01:47:57,370
I'm gonna get that garbage
suited and wrong with that
suit. That suit is garbage.

1876
01:47:57,371 --> 01:48:01,590
It's garbage about it. The fit
of it is tight. It's weird.

1877
01:48:01,591 --> 01:48:05,070
I think I buttoned the wrong button.
It's a weird fit.

1878
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:09,080
I think it's fine.
Did you,

1879
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:12,750
did you get crazy when you high when you
looked at this and get freaked out by

1880
01:48:12,751 --> 01:48:14,790
it? No. It's just when it like, yeah,

1881
01:48:14,791 --> 01:48:17,220
I mean me and my girlfriend
gives me shit about it sometimes.

1882
01:48:17,221 --> 01:48:21,600
Like she gives a shit about that
video. Yeah, it was horrible.

1883
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,730
Or was another tie. What? Horrible suit.

1884
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,640
Because I got better suits now
so I'll see it and I'm like, man,

1885
01:48:26,641 --> 01:48:31,540
that's suits sucks you a suit guy.
Do you get like your suits tailored?

1886
01:48:32,370 --> 01:48:36,720
I got my first tailored suit a few weeks
ago for this event idea for the Bulls

1887
01:48:36,721 --> 01:48:39,150
in Chicago, so I needed a
suit last minute, so I like,

1888
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:42,390
I splurged on a suit and
got a nice one and it was,

1889
01:48:42,391 --> 01:48:44,490
it was killing and I'm making sure that I,

1890
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:48,280
I wear as many events as I can just
to get my money's worth for the suit.

1891
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:52,850
That's a sign of being a grownup man.
You get a nice suit. Yeah, it was.

1892
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:58,050
He tell it there and it felt slick and it
was a, it was a smooth suit and it, it,

1893
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,720
that's what made me realize that
my other suits with garbage.

1894
01:49:01,110 --> 01:49:03,900
When I put on a good suit, I was
like Internet. I'm like, this is,

1895
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:07,590
this is how a suit should look. I looked
at the other shelter like, Oh fuck.

1896
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:09,340
I was on TV like that.
My

1897
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:14,920
every TV special I've ever done has
been like a tee shirt or you know,

1898
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,230
largely tee shirt,
jeans.

1899
01:49:16,231 --> 01:49:19,950
Usually I don't want to trust in a way
that I don't normally dress where I'm

1900
01:49:19,951 --> 01:49:22,280
comfortable. Right. You know? Yeah.

1901
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,530
I don't for my like for
TV appraisers just to,

1902
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:29,790
or like a late night
shows like doing a set,

1903
01:49:29,791 --> 01:49:33,480
I'll put on a suit just to out of respect
for the show, you know what I mean?

1904
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:35,730
But uh,
like for my special,

1905
01:49:35,850 --> 01:49:39,350
my first one I just want to button
up and then my latest one, I just,

1906
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:44,460
I wore a jacket over,
a nice jacket over a t shirt.

1907
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:49,000
What does this, this is amazing because
like that's just jeans and tee shirt.

1908
01:49:49,001 --> 01:49:53,300
Would you put a jacket? People like,
Holy Shit, you look great. Yeah.

1909
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:55,540
Just what a jacket over my regular shit

1910
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,350
jacket makes you look like
you're a professional.

1911
01:49:59,351 --> 01:50:02,050
But also it just makes people you like,

1912
01:50:02,051 --> 01:50:06,040
it's funny how close will determine how
people just approach you and just how

1913
01:50:06,041 --> 01:50:09,580
people treat you and how people talk to
you and how people respond to this shit.

1914
01:50:09,581 --> 01:50:13,330
You have to say like a jacket
or a suit and we'll just change.

1915
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:16,020
Especially if you're a young man,
you know,

1916
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,820
especially if you're like
a man in his twenties.

1917
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:21,120
A guy in his twenties with a suit is
totally different than a guy in his

1918
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:21,700
twenties but a tee shirt.

1919
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:24,010
Yeah, it's, yeah, it is.

1920
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:28,740
It's just you will elicit that person
seems more intelligent all of a sudden put

1921
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,280
pitfall, more respectful.
They, it's weird that, that,

1922
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:36,400
that that's like how did that, I think
about that too, like how did suits become?

1923
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:39,270
How did that become the way
to dress? Like was one, dude,

1924
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:41,620
I'm going to wear this and then
people were like, that looks good.

1925
01:50:41,621 --> 01:50:43,870
What do I get that shit? Yeah, dude,

1926
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:48,190
who has like a suit and tie on and he's
holding a clipboard automatically take

1927
01:50:48,191 --> 01:50:50,620
them seriously. You take them
seriously. You defer to him.

1928
01:50:50,690 --> 01:50:54,010
I got to ask him something and let me
be respectful. He might shut me down.

1929
01:50:54,011 --> 01:50:56,380
He might ruin my life.
He might ruin my night.

1930
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:00,910
The same kid with flip flops on and a tee
shirt, a pair of shorts, piece of shit.

1931
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:06,250
How do you get this job? Who is
he? Yeah. Imagine if you went to

1932
01:51:06,470 --> 01:51:09,380
a Mercedes dealership and you wanted
to buy one of those beautiful cars.

1933
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:14,020
Like I work in mine on the counters
wearing fucking flip flops and shorts and

1934
01:51:14,021 --> 01:51:17,000
wants to sign. He's telling you all this
crazy shit about Mercedes, Mercedes,

1935
01:51:17,001 --> 01:51:20,570
that the engineering is the finest
in all of Europe and what they do.

1936
01:51:21,590 --> 01:51:23,990
And you'd be like, I mean listen
to this fucking idiot was stupid.

1937
01:51:24,290 --> 01:51:26,600
I'm looking at it, look at
his feet, look at his toes.

1938
01:51:26,601 --> 01:51:28,130
He got something in between his toes.

1939
01:51:28,790 --> 01:51:32,420
But you know what I don't like is it
sometimes people will use that against you

1940
01:51:32,421 --> 01:51:35,600
where I'll stay at a
nice hotel and a person,

1941
01:51:35,660 --> 01:51:39,050
there's time people at the hotel,
it dress nice and they'll,

1942
01:51:39,290 --> 01:51:44,060
they'll take on a vibe like they
own the hotel. It was like relax,

1943
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:48,520
relax a little bit. Oh Sir,
we do not allow that in,

1944
01:51:48,521 --> 01:51:52,880
in this shot to a mamoosh
ma. And I want to say, sir,

1945
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:57,190
I think you make 30 to 50,000
a year comp that like they,

1946
01:51:57,230 --> 01:52:01,760
but they talk like it this way. Like get
a king, like Whoa, relax a little bit.

1947
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:05,360
And so like maybe, and then maybe
if I had on a suit I'd be like, sir,

1948
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:08,490
you shut the fuck up.
I'm also a suits right now.

1949
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:12,060
That's true. Right, right.

1950
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:14,710
You wear flip flops and
a dude is wearing a suit.

1951
01:52:14,711 --> 01:52:17,820
He automatically is one up in you.
And if you,

1952
01:52:17,821 --> 01:52:21,760
you could be a rich fucking dude
unless you got a crazy fat watch.

1953
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:23,600
If you show up.
Yeah.

1954
01:52:23,810 --> 01:52:26,170
Have you checking in a fancy hotel
and you were in the flip flops,

1955
01:52:26,171 --> 01:52:31,171
but you got some stupid fucking gigantic
$20,000 watch on your arm and people

1956
01:52:31,481 --> 01:52:34,150
know it and you're gesturing
with your hands a lot.

1957
01:52:34,151 --> 01:52:38,620
And he says big fucking chunky
diamond crusted watch like a, okay,

1958
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:41,650
we got to listen. And Scott.
Yeah, let them talk a little
bit. It's got some money.

1959
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:46,610
But yeah,
I mean I think that's what I do.

1960
01:52:47,030 --> 01:52:49,490
I actually liked dressing horribly in,

1961
01:52:49,491 --> 01:52:53,510
in a high level situations like I love,

1962
01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:57,980
I get upgraded or I fly first a lot
and I love being in like jogging pants.

1963
01:52:58,490 --> 01:53:01,370
I love being a young
black dude jogging pants.

1964
01:53:01,610 --> 01:53:04,310
If first class people like,
Ooh,

1965
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:10,200
I think it will fit it hat
on and my headphones and
people like what the fuck is

1966
01:53:11,090 --> 01:53:12,430
he?
How is he,

1967
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:17,420
what do you think he
and my favorite thing,

1968
01:53:17,421 --> 01:53:19,970
I don't know what it is if
it's my demeanor or whatever,

1969
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,420
but I like it cause I like mine.

1970
01:53:21,710 --> 01:53:25,340
Nobody ever talks to me at first
just about nobody. Nobody ever.

1971
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:29,380
I'm always rich, rich, celebrity.

1972
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:34,820
Nobody ever talks to me in first.
Where's my girl was,

1973
01:53:34,821 --> 01:53:37,340
she'll fly for like, I hear
about her, she'll tell it.

1974
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:39,560
I talked this business guy was blah,
blah blah.

1975
01:53:39,561 --> 01:53:43,730
And now I'm at this rapper was on
the plane with me and this is like,

1976
01:53:43,731 --> 01:53:46,310
these people will just babble,
monster hurt,

1977
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,280
Babel monsters or turn my cousin mate.

1978
01:53:48,281 --> 01:53:51,130
Well some people just talk to you when
you don't want them to talk like, Oh,

1979
01:53:51,131 --> 01:53:53,200
people monopolize the conversation babble.

1980
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:55,610
But just people were just talking
obviously cause he's a girl.

1981
01:53:55,611 --> 01:54:00,260
But this is a funny thing where people
won't even engage usually with me on the

1982
01:54:00,261 --> 01:54:01,094
plane,

1983
01:54:01,350 --> 01:54:04,920
I got an ear beating from me and Tommy
[inaudible] girl. Do you know Tom Segura?

1984
01:54:04,921 --> 01:54:09,390
Yeah, me and Thomas Grower.
We're on a flight once. And
this woman who was the, uh,

1985
01:54:09,420 --> 01:54:11,010
the attendant on the flight,

1986
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:15,930
she gave us the most unbelievable ear
beating I've ever experienced in my life.

1987
01:54:16,230 --> 01:54:19,350
It was just staggering. Good. Her Stamina,

1988
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:22,650
her ability to not recognize clues,

1989
01:54:24,510 --> 01:54:29,210
the whole thing. She asked us,
we would like some wine and a,

1990
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:30,360
we said a,
sure,

1991
01:54:30,361 --> 01:54:34,650
and I forget what Tommy asked for it for
that asked for Cabernet or Pinot Noir.

1992
01:54:34,651 --> 01:54:37,740
Like, do you have a, you know, you have
a, whatever you asked for a typical,

1993
01:54:37,950 --> 01:54:41,160
and she started cracking some
jokes about the movie sideways.

1994
01:54:41,190 --> 01:54:45,360
Do you ever see that movie? I have.
It's a movie about, um, it's with, um,

1995
01:54:45,810 --> 01:54:49,380
um, the dude from wings. That's
a fucking cool ass guy's name.

1996
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:55,530
Fucking shit. What's his
name? The Dude Church. Uh,

1997
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:59,220
what the fuck is this? Danny
Thomas Haden Church, uh,

1998
01:54:59,290 --> 01:55:03,210
who's a very cool guy actually. Um,
and uh, you know, it's all about wine.

1999
01:55:03,211 --> 01:55:06,840
It's just so she starts reciting this
scene. It's like that scene and you know,

2000
01:55:06,841 --> 01:55:09,510
blah, blah, blah. And then she goes,
well, I've never really been into wine,

2001
01:55:09,511 --> 01:55:11,180
but I'll tell you why.
There was a guy once that you know,

2002
01:55:11,850 --> 01:55:16,850
he had the bottle of wine he brings to
the rest and she's just going on and on

2003
01:55:17,461 --> 01:55:21,450
and on, and I'm not exaggerating like
15 minutes. She won't shut the fuck up.

2004
01:55:21,630 --> 01:55:24,960
She just hovering over this chair and
we're panicking. This is it. On a plane,

2005
01:55:24,961 --> 01:55:28,110
on the fucking plane. The flight
attendants on the fucking plane. Oh,

2006
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:29,700
lean over the seat.

2007
01:55:29,701 --> 01:55:34,080
Just beating us into submission
with stupid ass story.

2008
01:55:34,410 --> 01:55:38,010
And so I start writing down, I, I'm in
the window seat and he's in the aisle,

2009
01:55:38,011 --> 01:55:41,970
so he's stuck with [inaudible] band in
him and just start looking out the window.

2010
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:44,040
I was like, I can't do anymore.
I have to start looking

2011
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:47,670
at the window. She won't stop. She's
just, she's worked her way from the,

2012
01:55:47,671 --> 01:55:52,110
the quote from the movie sideways to a
story about a dude with wine to story

2013
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:56,490
about her ex husband and it's a fucking
murderer as a salt on the eardrum.

2014
01:55:56,870 --> 01:55:59,750
Tom was proudly so
punch drunk at the time.

2015
01:55:59,751 --> 01:56:02,030
We could think we said
it went to the bathroom.

2016
01:56:02,170 --> 01:56:04,450
Well, Tommy had a really
interesting point because Tommy,

2017
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:09,040
I abandoned him and I left him to
to be slaughtered by her and he, uh,

2018
01:56:09,070 --> 01:56:12,280
he developed a psychological
profile of her and say, he said,

2019
01:56:12,281 --> 01:56:15,850
I think because we were on a small
plane, he was a small flight. He goes,

2020
01:56:15,851 --> 01:56:19,720
I think the reason why this lady's on
a small flight is because other ladies

2021
01:56:19,721 --> 01:56:20,620
don't want to work with her.

2022
01:56:20,830 --> 01:56:24,280
So they stick around the small flights
where she works by herself because she's

2023
01:56:24,281 --> 01:56:25,114
clueless.

2024
01:56:25,330 --> 01:56:28,540
She has no one to shut the fuck up and
everybody wants to get away from her.

2025
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:31,090
I was sticker on these
little flights one hour,

2026
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:32,890
hour and a half type flight
or something like that. Yeah.

2027
01:56:32,891 --> 01:56:34,960
It wasn't a very long flight.
Yeah. I forget where we're going,

2028
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:39,290
but the beating that just,
yeah,

2029
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:41,830
just brutal.
You're beating this broad gauge.

2030
01:56:41,890 --> 01:56:44,770
Yeah. It's tough and it's just, you
don't want to feel like a bad product.

2031
01:56:44,771 --> 01:56:48,160
Like is that even though in your
brain is this tough socially, but hey,

2032
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:51,130
can you shut the fuck up? Oh he's
this, but it's this, it's tough to do.

2033
01:56:51,131 --> 01:56:55,150
Especially in a confined space like
that. Uh, in an air, in an airplane.

2034
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:57,890
I mean in a social situation is
easier cause you can just say, yeah,

2035
01:56:57,891 --> 01:57:00,790
I'm about to go, go to the, go to the
bar, you need anything I'm going to get.

2036
01:57:00,830 --> 01:57:03,010
And they usually don't need a drink,
but that's the way to cut people off.

2037
01:57:03,250 --> 01:57:04,120
I'm going to get a drink.

2038
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:08,350
Yeah. You or you say, excuse me, I gotta
use the restroom. I hate to be rude,

2039
01:57:08,351 --> 01:57:09,190
but I have to use the restroom.

2040
01:57:09,370 --> 01:57:12,880
And then I would just drop my phone and
start looking forward in between the

2041
01:57:12,881 --> 01:57:16,780
seat and hopefully would just, she would
find a reason to keep walking. Yeah.

2042
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:19,450
But she would, she would do it not
just to us. She did it to everybody.

2043
01:57:19,451 --> 01:57:23,470
She decided to stop with. We watched her.
She went, she got done beating us up.

2044
01:57:23,471 --> 01:57:26,530
She went over to somebody else and beat
them up. So she was a social terrorist.

2045
01:57:26,531 --> 01:57:30,730
She was a terrorist,
wants to the terrorist one on that night.

2046
01:57:30,970 --> 01:57:34,120
I had to jump out real quick to the
bathroom. Go ahead man. Go ahead.

2047
01:57:34,121 --> 01:57:38,170
Don't worry about it. I'll tell everybody
about, uh, my show. I got coming up soon.

2048
01:57:38,590 --> 01:57:42,910
A lot of people, folks, they can't
handle these three hour conversations.

2049
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:47,050
They don't develop the bladder control
that a man like me has. You know,

2050
01:57:47,051 --> 01:57:51,820
it's a man like me sitting here two hours
plus and I'm not feeling it. I'm fine.

2051
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:55,300
Two hours and 10 minutes. By the
way, if you ever watch a UFC,

2052
01:57:55,301 --> 01:57:58,840
this is an inside joke
and you hear me talking.

2053
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:04,230
Only me talking while the fighter is
walking from the back room to the cage.

2054
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:09,010
That means Mike Goldberg went to pee
because my goal burpees like crazy.

2055
01:58:09,190 --> 01:58:12,700
I don't know what's going on with my
Goldberg. He tells me everything's fine.

2056
01:58:12,910 --> 01:58:13,930
I believe him,

2057
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:19,380
but I have a hard time believing a man
can pee as much as Michael burpees.

2058
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:25,180
I don't, I don't even understand it.
It doesn't even make sense to me. Like,

2059
01:58:25,181 --> 01:58:27,340
I'll go to take a leak,
don't get me wrong because um,

2060
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:29,290
a lot of times I'll have
a cup of coffee there.

2061
01:58:29,290 --> 01:58:31,080
I'll have a couple of bottles of water.

2062
01:58:31,090 --> 01:58:33,040
You want to keep hydrated while
you're screaming and yelling.

2063
01:58:33,190 --> 01:58:37,570
So I will get up and go to take a leak,
but I'll do it.

2064
01:58:37,571 --> 01:58:40,420
And then an hour later,
like he'll do another one,

2065
01:58:40,421 --> 01:58:44,650
like we'll go together and this motherfuck
will pee again inside of an hour.

2066
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:48,220
And I don't know how he does it,
but heal the most he ever did so far.

2067
01:58:48,221 --> 01:58:51,190
You know in a UFC event is six,
he peed six times.

2068
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:54,850
My cohost in UFC,
Mike Goldberg,

2069
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:56,860
who's a Great Guy But likes to pee.

2070
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:01,190
So apparently he enjoys running out
to the bathroom and taking lynx.

2071
01:59:01,690 --> 01:59:03,050
Was he drinking a lot of waters?

2072
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:06,220
He just says a lot of water and drinks
red bulls and shit like that too.

2073
01:59:06,370 --> 01:59:10,420
While we're doing the broadcast is taken
off six times an hour. No, in a show.

2074
01:59:10,530 --> 01:59:12,070
And it's showing a whole UFC show,

2075
01:59:12,071 --> 01:59:16,060
which is like six hours where the
fights hot us. I mean if he's, you know,

2076
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:20,830
sort of still ridiculous man, you know,
this is what you're doing. Sit down.

2077
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:24,280
Yeah. If you do it, I
guess if you do a TV yeah.

2078
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:29,660
Strengthen your pee. Yeah.
But uh, for, you know,

2079
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:33,940
just for most people as they get older,
apparently that becomes an issue.

2080
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:38,650
Dude's develop prostate problems and
your, your, your prostate enlarges.

2081
01:59:39,430 --> 01:59:41,650
I know this because I
had to get my dog fixed,

2082
01:59:42,010 --> 01:59:44,740
my dog's prostate and large so
much that it was constipated.

2083
01:59:44,810 --> 01:59:46,970
That's your dog fix was a,
a metaphor

2084
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:52,310
prostate. And I noticed how I get that

2085
01:59:54,210 --> 01:59:55,770
shit. Is this, what happens after four?

2086
01:59:56,840 --> 02:00:01,520
Doug was six and he's uh, he's um,
he developed a enlarge prostate.

2087
02:00:01,521 --> 02:00:05,570
I had to get them fixed shit.
Johnny Cash no longer has balls.

2088
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:07,730
He seems happy though.
He was,

2089
02:00:07,731 --> 02:00:10,520
he was actually getting constipated
because of it was really interesting.

2090
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:15,440
Like it was blocking up. Was pinching.
Where's Colin is. Yeah. Poor dog.

2091
02:00:15,870 --> 02:00:20,530
They, uh, when I was on that a
goat farm, a worker with them,

2092
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:25,150
they had, they had me, uh, I was milking
the garden and they brought one gold in.

2093
02:00:25,750 --> 02:00:29,020
They had me bring, there's
this one young, uh, male goat,

2094
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:32,740
anything like you want to name
them? And I was like, yeah,

2095
02:00:32,750 --> 02:00:35,680
name names [inaudible] they're boy.
You sure? And they're like, yeah.

2096
02:00:35,681 --> 02:00:37,060
And in a band they were like,

2097
02:00:37,061 --> 02:00:40,820
we're going to band them and they put
a band around his balls. And so Ebay,

2098
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:45,040
they do like a delay. Castration
isn't that like they cut it off.

2099
02:00:45,730 --> 02:00:50,440
They, they put the band on in
the is fall off two weeks later.

2100
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:54,490
But I didn't like that they told me,
they sent me up to name him.

2101
02:00:55,390 --> 02:00:57,730
Uh, and then they were
like, and now, yeah,

2102
02:00:57,731 --> 02:01:01,150
he's not going to have balls in a little
while. Like that's pretty shitty. Yo.

2103
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:03,400
Well they were going to do that anyway.
They were going to do it anyway,

2104
02:01:03,401 --> 02:01:05,890
but they didn't have to have
me hold him as they did it.

2105
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:08,970
Yeah. That's kind of fucked.
Yeah. To them it's normal.

2106
02:01:09,110 --> 02:01:12,310
Yeah. But no, it was, I mean, I
guess it will be all right TV,

2107
02:01:12,311 --> 02:01:15,120
but after she kind of made me feel weird.

2108
02:01:16,070 --> 02:01:18,410
You know, human beings do that
to themselves sometimes too.

2109
02:01:18,411 --> 02:01:22,370
That's like one of the ways that men
castrate themselves is that they use like

2110
02:01:22,371 --> 02:01:25,160
rubber bands and tighten it all
up and it all just goes dead.

2111
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:26,300
Then they saw it off.

2112
02:01:26,730 --> 02:01:29,160
Wait, who? What type of duties?
I castrate in themselves.

2113
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:33,290
A lot of crazy fucking people out there,
man. There's um, there was a wedding,

2114
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:38,270
a website called a BME
extreme that's from the,

2115
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:40,100
there's a video,
the BME pain

2116
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:44,240
Olympics. See that acronym?
Yeah. I don't know.

2117
02:01:44,241 --> 02:01:47,090
Apparently there's no real pain Olympics.
It's not real,

2118
02:01:47,091 --> 02:01:51,410
but they called this video. The BME
don't pull that up, but there's a,

2119
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:55,670
a video of a bunch of dudes hack and their
dicks off and cutting their balls out

2120
02:01:55,671 --> 02:01:59,270
and people have done it. It's definitely
happened. And they've done it on video.

2121
02:01:59,271 --> 02:02:02,690
This people have cut their fingers
off on video and put the video online,

2122
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:06,860
cut the tip of their finger off with a
sword. People are fun. Yeah. It's crazy.

2123
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:12,910
One off activities. Yeah. You want,
can't repeat that repeat last.

2124
02:02:12,911 --> 02:02:16,610
Just champion. That's a one
off. It wasn't worth it.

2125
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:21,110
Some weird thing where some people like
to do that for whatever reason they want

2126
02:02:21,111 --> 02:02:24,720
to, they want to castrate
themselves like they, like it's,

2127
02:02:24,730 --> 02:02:28,520
it's more common than not. In fact, you
know, that's what they're trying to,

2128
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:29,383
you know,

2129
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:34,620
release themselves from
this Bin is one sec.

2130
02:02:34,621 --> 02:02:38,690
So much like, you know, the
way I deleted my Twitter APP.

2131
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:45,080
Exactly. And, but then they realized
they wanted it afterwards. But you know,

2132
02:02:45,110 --> 02:02:47,120
I can reinstall Twitter. We'll, you know,

2133
02:02:47,121 --> 02:02:49,670
supposedly I had read
this about Nikola Tesla,

2134
02:02:49,730 --> 02:02:54,110
the famous inventor that he did something
he didn't explain, explain what he did,

2135
02:02:54,111 --> 02:02:59,060
but in quotes destroyed his sexuality.
He had some really confusing,

2136
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:03,830
uh,
love situation with some woman apparently.

2137
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:08,390
And he just got it just ruined everything,
ruined his life, ruined his work.

2138
02:03:08,690 --> 02:03:12,590
He just got messed up with some
chick and then decide to, in quotes,

2139
02:03:12,591 --> 02:03:15,440
destroy his sexuality.
And I don't know if that's true or not,

2140
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:20,920
but you're talking about a guy and Nicola
Tesla who was a crazy genius inventor

2141
02:03:21,081 --> 02:03:24,200
who also was in love with a
pigeon thought this pigeon.

2142
02:03:24,201 --> 02:03:27,620
He was like in love with this pigeon
and this weird romantic interest in a

2143
02:03:27,621 --> 02:03:31,160
pigeon before he died.
He said completely off the rails.

2144
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:34,250
So does he deserve to have a
car named after him on that?

2145
02:03:35,420 --> 02:03:39,260
He's a bad motherfucker. He wasn't. No.
It's crazy. If humans are never perfect,

2146
02:03:39,261 --> 02:03:41,870
no one knew.
No one retires with an undefeated record.

2147
02:03:41,871 --> 02:03:46,370
Not even Floyd Mayweather along the
way, he takes some losses, losses,

2148
02:03:46,430 --> 02:03:51,370
and uh, you know, making
out with a pigeon never

2149
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:53,960
made out with it.

2150
02:03:53,961 --> 02:03:57,470
I think he just was in love with a
picture of what it visit and destroyed his

2151
02:03:57,471 --> 02:04:01,280
own. Again, that's what I
read. That could be propaganda.

2152
02:04:01,690 --> 02:04:06,080
I'm exposing propaganda left and rights.
It might be, might be propaganda.

2153
02:04:06,330 --> 02:04:10,700
Might not be real. Like Napoleon did,
you know, to Polian wasn't short. Whoa.

2154
02:04:10,850 --> 02:04:14,750
That's a mind fuck. In fact, he was
taller than average for the time. Please.

2155
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:19,040
He's like five, eight, five, six, five,
six. Yeah, for France. Let's find out.

2156
02:04:19,190 --> 02:04:23,990
Napoleon. Napoleon Polian
is real height, but I mean,

2157
02:04:23,991 --> 02:04:26,510
that's a standard, right? Oh,
he's got an Napoleon complex.

2158
02:04:26,511 --> 02:04:29,060
A standard five foot six.
Yeah.

2159
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:32,300
So back then when people have
no fucking nutrition whatsoever,

2160
02:04:32,301 --> 02:04:35,560
that was actually taller
than average. Okay, so,

2161
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:38,250
so the Polian complex,
this means

2162
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:42,480
you want to take all of this shit?
Yeah, it depends. This actually,

2163
02:04:42,490 --> 02:04:44,700
this one actually says 5.7

2164
02:04:46,610 --> 02:04:51,360
it's five five foot, seven inches.
This one says whatever it was for.

2165
02:04:51,361 --> 02:04:54,510
Then back then,
that wasn't nearly short as it is now.

2166
02:04:54,511 --> 02:04:58,710
Like I'm five eight and I'm short for
today for 2014 when people have good

2167
02:04:58,711 --> 02:05:02,610
nutrition. Yeah, but back then
that was actually a tall guy.

2168
02:05:02,611 --> 02:05:06,450
Like there was a regular size guy.
There was like a guy was like five 11 wow.

2169
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:09,730
Yeah, it's like normal.
Maybe not even five of this.

2170
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:12,270
Five 11 five 10 what
does average five nine,

2171
02:05:12,340 --> 02:05:15,600
seven or something like that in five.
Eight oh, sorry, I'm about five.

2172
02:05:15,601 --> 02:05:18,690
10 let's find out. I got
him. Napoleon complex.

2173
02:05:20,070 --> 02:05:23,940
What's the average height?
What's the average American
height? What's the average?

2174
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:26,000
Okay.

2175
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,410
Male American.

2176
02:05:28,310 --> 02:05:28,900
Okay.

2177
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:32,220
All right. Okay. Let's
see. I'm saying five nine

2178
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:33,770
yeah.

2179
02:05:33,770 --> 02:05:36,230
The average us is five.
10

2180
02:05:37,270 --> 02:05:38,103
okay.

2181
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:42,920
Oh, the average. Yup. Yeah, no. Yeah,

2182
02:05:42,921 --> 02:05:47,300
that's, yeah, that's what is that average.
So they're saying, is that that higher,

2183
02:05:47,330 --> 02:05:51,650
taller than average? What do
you think the average would be?

2184
02:05:52,220 --> 02:05:55,610
Maybe? Well, this one thing says five,

2185
02:05:55,611 --> 02:06:00,400
10 average male American height,
average female, male s, uh,

2186
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:04,190
is five foot 10 inches. Okay.
Yeah. It says, here's another one,

2187
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:07,190
and us mail five foot 10 inches.
I'll take it.

2188
02:06:07,310 --> 02:06:11,320
I haven't done as much research as is
this. I was just feeling me and my friend.

2189
02:06:11,380 --> 02:06:16,070
Well, I think it goes up. I think it's
gone up definitely since I was born.

2190
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:17,840
And I think part of it is nutrition.

2191
02:06:18,470 --> 02:06:21,230
People understand things and they also
noticed stand not to smoke when you were

2192
02:06:21,231 --> 02:06:24,740
in the womb. I think that's, fuck,
that's fucked. A lot of kids up.

2193
02:06:26,050 --> 02:06:29,060
A lot of women used to smoke when they
were, they were probably, my mom smoked.

2194
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:33,050
Yeah. Yeah. She's pulling from me and
my sister. She apologize to you. Nope.

2195
02:06:33,350 --> 02:06:37,950
We don't bring it up really well. She got
to do apologize for the PAG. Yes. Right.

2196
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,780
Let go cause a fight. It go. Okay,
now it's, yeah. Yeah. Basically.

2197
02:06:42,860 --> 02:06:46,650
Basically, almost every one
of these studies shows it's
about five foot 10 from,

2198
02:06:46,730 --> 02:06:48,650
for for now.
Okay.

2199
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:52,160
In the U s which is interesting
because it's definitely gone up,

2200
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:57,770
uh, over a c, what does that average,

2201
02:06:57,800 --> 02:07:01,790
this is the Netherlands, the USA,
France and Japan. Average man.

2202
02:07:01,970 --> 02:07:06,410
So Japan is the shortest with BMI.
And Japan's changing too though, man.

2203
02:07:06,411 --> 02:07:08,060
There's a lot of much bigger dudes,

2204
02:07:08,090 --> 02:07:12,230
Japan now than there was like during the
World War II days. They're way bigger.

2205
02:07:12,410 --> 02:07:16,670
So what is the less,
the theory behind, uh,

2206
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:21,360
Japanese to having a short is, is
it just because they don't, uh,

2207
02:07:21,470 --> 02:07:26,270
mixed with other races as much?
And so it's just genetics could be,

2208
02:07:26,420 --> 02:07:29,270
um, it could, there's a lot
of factors. It could be,

2209
02:07:29,271 --> 02:07:31,390
it could be also that it's an
island. You know, it's not,

2210
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:34,790
not the biggest place in the world.
You know, it's not a tiny island.

2211
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:38,350
It's not like re unreal islands,
like real small places.

2212
02:07:38,351 --> 02:07:41,920
They have a thing called island
dwarfism or things on that island. Uh,

2213
02:07:42,030 --> 02:07:44,290
like that's if you are seeing that,

2214
02:07:44,410 --> 02:07:48,190
that a little creature that
they found Homo Floresiensis,

2215
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:52,540
he's the hobbit man that they found
that lived like 14,000 years ago.

2216
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:55,000
We'd never seen that. Oh,
fascinating shit, man.

2217
02:07:55,240 --> 02:08:00,160
14,000 years ago there was little people
that lived alongside human beings that

2218
02:08:00,161 --> 02:08:03,400
looked just like you or I, and there
were these little tiny like hobbit,

2219
02:08:03,401 --> 02:08:07,240
like creatures. They're like three feet
tall and they were a type of human being,

2220
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:11,780
not like human, not like Neanderthal,
pull up the images. Like there's an,

2221
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:16,390
there's an image of a homo floresiensis
that they made the hobbit man and uh,

2222
02:08:16,420 --> 02:08:18,640
this in this island of Flores,

2223
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:21,850
they found one and they thought it was
like maybe a child's bone or something

2224
02:08:21,851 --> 02:08:22,480
like that.

2225
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:25,570
But then they realized that it was
structurally different than a human beings

2226
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:27,880
and they thought it might've
been just an aberration,

2227
02:08:27,881 --> 02:08:30,820
like someone who had some
sort of a disorder and then
they start finding more of

2228
02:08:30,821 --> 02:08:32,650
them and they found out that
they buried their young,

2229
02:08:32,651 --> 02:08:36,460
they would find like little graveyards
and shit. They found stone tools.

2230
02:08:36,461 --> 02:08:41,350
They realize they use tools and evidence
of use of fire. Pretty, pretty insane.

2231
02:08:41,390 --> 02:08:46,150
She has crazy, that's not that
long ago, man, to 14,000 years ago.

2232
02:08:46,510 --> 02:08:50,320
And what's really crazy is there's people
that think that there's something like

2233
02:08:50,321 --> 02:08:54,730
that that's still alive today. She's at
a small, they're small islands. Yeah.

2234
02:08:54,731 --> 02:08:56,740
See that's,
that gives you an idea of it,

2235
02:08:56,741 --> 02:08:58,810
but there's some good
images of those things,

2236
02:08:58,811 --> 02:09:03,430
but then you see like with
the neander tall gorillas,

2237
02:09:03,431 --> 02:09:07,720
human beings like look how little those
fucking things where they were a type of

2238
02:09:07,721 --> 02:09:12,190
people. Right. That's freaky
shit man. That is true. Yeah.

2239
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:14,530
And it's real thing.
I mean it really existed.

2240
02:09:14,980 --> 02:09:18,250
What is the big guy on the far right?
Not In the end to all,

2241
02:09:18,251 --> 02:09:21,610
but the guy who just don't,
yeah, it was that dude. Jesus.

2242
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:24,240
That's a big fucking dude.
That looks very apelike too.

2243
02:09:24,250 --> 02:09:27,820
Like look how long his arms are as
Jesus. What's it say? I can't read it.

2244
02:09:29,290 --> 02:09:32,080
Yeah, whatever it is. We
glad we moved past that.

2245
02:09:32,110 --> 02:09:35,410
Those dudes would be running shit.
They were still around.

2246
02:09:35,620 --> 02:09:40,390
That looks like a combination of like
a homosapien and like almost like a

2247
02:09:40,391 --> 02:09:42,760
gorilla like extra long as arms are.

2248
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:44,890
I mean it might be just
the artist depiction.

2249
02:09:45,330 --> 02:09:49,690
It looks like a scary cat to run
into on the SAVANNA. Fuck all that.

2250
02:09:50,650 --> 02:09:52,650
Well apparently there was a,
a bunch of um,

2251
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:55,960
people that lived in
Russia too is recently as,

2252
02:09:55,961 --> 02:09:59,650
I think it was 40,000 years ago that
were completely different than then

2253
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:04,330
homosapiens to another, a different
site thousand, 40,000 years ago.

2254
02:10:04,870 --> 02:10:07,390
Didn't NCS or something like
that. Here, let me pull that up.

2255
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:11,410
A Russian new type of person,

2256
02:10:11,590 --> 02:10:15,580
type of human 40,000 years ago.

2257
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:19,540
Have you been to Japan before?
Yeah, it's amazing. It's incredible.

2258
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:22,840
It's a really interesting
place because um, it's,

2259
02:10:23,140 --> 02:10:28,090
it's first of all incredibly clean and
unbelievably polite and like really

2260
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:30,670
almost crime free completely.
Like when you walked on the streets,

2261
02:10:30,671 --> 02:10:32,050
you don't worry about shit every,

2262
02:10:32,051 --> 02:10:36,740
I mean you're in a major metropolitan
area like Tokyo and it seems like the most

2263
02:10:36,741 --> 02:10:41,030
peaceful place on earth. Very little
aggression. Everyone's very polite.

2264
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:46,280
People are like, like
whether it's shopkeepers are
restaurant owners are like,

2265
02:10:46,281 --> 02:10:47,150
when you're walking on the street,

2266
02:10:47,151 --> 02:10:51,530
you don't have any sense of chaos like
you have in New York City, Israel or the,

2267
02:10:51,650 --> 02:10:56,480
oh, that's cool, man. Yeah.
Foe, here's it is, it's in a,

2268
02:10:56,481 --> 02:11:01,481
is in the National Geographic Dna reveals
lost relative from 40,000 years ago,

2269
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:04,240
Russian researches dug up,
uh,

2270
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:08,330
a sliver of human finger bone
from an isolated Siberian cave.

2271
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:11,810
The team stored it away
for a later testing,

2272
02:11:11,811 --> 02:11:15,410
assuming that the nondescript fragment
came from one of those neanderthals, uh,

2273
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:17,810
who left a,
a welter of tools.

2274
02:11:17,811 --> 02:11:20,520
I don't even know what a welter is and
I haven't heard that expression well to

2275
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:22,220
alter of tools.
So that'd be,

2276
02:11:22,650 --> 02:11:22,990
yeah.

2277
02:11:22,990 --> 02:11:25,750
Yeah. Well, no. Have
you ever heard of that?

2278
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:28,750
What's l w e l t e r welter of tools.

2279
02:11:29,110 --> 02:11:32,050
And it came between 30
and 48,000 years ago.

2280
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:34,240
And nothing about the
bones seemed extraordinary,

2281
02:11:34,241 --> 02:11:36,430
but the genetic material
told a different story.

2282
02:11:36,580 --> 02:11:39,790
When the German researcher is extracted
and sequenced the DNA from the fossil,

2283
02:11:39,791 --> 02:11:44,791
they found that it did not match that of
neanderthals or of modern human beings,

2284
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:47,020
which were also living nearby at the time.

2285
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:50,560
So a new genetic data reveal that
the bone may belong to a previously

2286
02:11:50,590 --> 02:11:55,590
unrecognized extinct human species that
migrated out of Africa long before our

2287
02:11:56,561 --> 02:11:59,710
known relatives. That's
all 40,000 years ago, man,

2288
02:11:59,740 --> 02:12:02,050
there was a different
type of fucking human.

2289
02:12:02,110 --> 02:12:05,380
They went to Russia that was in
Russia. In Siberia. Africa. Yup.

2290
02:12:05,530 --> 02:12:09,610
So Africa sucked back then. Well,
people always keep walking, dude.

2291
02:12:09,820 --> 02:12:12,550
They just keep going. That's
just within us. We keep going.

2292
02:12:12,910 --> 02:12:16,390
I guess maybe people got to California
and then they decided to move to Maui.

2293
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:21,700
Like this. Just keep on going. They
got direct flights to not back then.

2294
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:26,320
Just boats. Crazy. Yeah. That
wasn't, was that Bolts Beck?

2295
02:12:26,350 --> 02:12:29,020
That was this 40,000 years ago.

2296
02:12:29,230 --> 02:12:33,460
Most likely no boats is straight up
walking and walking and walking. Yeah,

2297
02:12:33,461 --> 02:12:36,340
they're starting to fucking
backdate boats though. They've uh,

2298
02:12:36,341 --> 02:12:40,360
they've backdated boats quite a bit.
I think they found evidence of a tuna,

2299
02:12:40,390 --> 02:12:45,220
like oldest evidence of tuna, like way
earlier than they ever thought. Oldest,

2300
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:50,050
no tuna boat,
tuna boat.

2301
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:54,170
They're magic. The first dude
that make a boat was like, man,

2302
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:58,470
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
I don't even know where to go.

2303
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:03,980
Well, they had it. Wow, dude,
sweat this. They had boats.

2304
02:13:04,100 --> 02:13:07,520
They were fishing boats and three 10 a d

2305
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:11,090
the earliest known boat was made.

2306
02:13:11,150 --> 02:13:15,080
It's a 7,000 year old boat found in
Kuwait as the earliest known boat,

2307
02:13:15,290 --> 02:13:18,110
but now they found evidence
of deep sea fishing.

2308
02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:22,220
42,000 years old,
a bolt.

2309
02:13:22,221 --> 02:13:26,330
This is the newest shit that will,
they found evidence of, of a,

2310
02:13:26,331 --> 02:13:30,280
of tuna bones
and tune our deep sea fish.

2311
02:13:30,310 --> 02:13:33,270
So someone had to out there
and get these motherfuckers.

2312
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:37,680
The earliest known bolts found in France
and the NFL are only 10,000 years old,

2313
02:13:37,681 --> 02:13:40,860
but archeologists know that
they don't tell the whole story.

2314
02:13:40,861 --> 02:13:44,370
Would in other common boat building
materials don't preserve well and the

2315
02:13:44,371 --> 02:13:48,870
archaeological record and the colonization
of Australia and the nearby islands

2316
02:13:48,871 --> 02:13:52,710
of Southeast Asia,
which began at least 45,000 years ago,

2317
02:13:52,711 --> 02:13:56,460
required sea crossings of
at least 30 kilometers.

2318
02:13:56,490 --> 02:14:01,490
So they know that 45,000 years ago
someone had a boat that could go about 60

2319
02:14:01,531 --> 02:14:04,920
miles, right? Isn't that
what it is? Kilometers.

2320
02:14:05,190 --> 02:14:09,980
100 kilometers of 62 miles. I know
the opposite. So it's less kilometers.

2321
02:14:09,990 --> 02:14:13,980
Less than a mile? Correct.
Okay, so a little bit. A little
bit more miles than that.

2322
02:14:14,010 --> 02:14:17,310
Like double? Yeah. Hundreds. Yeah. Wow.

2323
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:22,790
That's crazy.
Yet whether or not these migrants put it,

2324
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:27,840
is that how it goes? Cause kilometer
and how many kilometers again? How many?

2325
02:14:28,110 --> 02:14:31,770
30 kilometers or 30 kilometers.
Just 20 miles. Okay. Okay.

2326
02:14:31,771 --> 02:14:35,470
So it's less miles or less
than kilometers, right? Right.

2327
02:14:35,490 --> 02:14:38,900
Cause a hundred kilometers an hour
is 62 miles an hour. All right. Okay.

2328
02:14:39,420 --> 02:14:44,310
So 30 kilometers,
probably 2020 ish miles in a boat.

2329
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:47,100
45,000 years ago.
Yet,

2330
02:14:47,101 --> 02:14:51,510
whether these early migrants put out
to sea deliberately in boats or simply

2331
02:14:51,511 --> 02:14:56,511
drifted from the tides in rafts meant
for near shore exploration as a matter of

2332
02:14:57,031 --> 02:15:01,320
fierce debate. So they at least
had that, this is crazy, man.

2333
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:06,300
That's crazy that they think people were
deep sea fishing 40 fucking thousand

2334
02:15:06,301 --> 02:15:11,160
years ago. People had to eat.
Yeah, but I mean it's amazing.

2335
02:15:11,730 --> 02:15:15,330
They've found half of the
fish in these areas, um,

2336
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:19,800
that these people lived in, uh,
off Australia 42,000 years ago.

2337
02:15:19,980 --> 02:15:24,960
Half of the fish they found were a tuna
and sharks that live in deep water.

2338
02:15:25,950 --> 02:15:30,180
They also found a fish hook from
a mollusk shell, a mollusk shell,

2339
02:15:30,181 --> 02:15:33,780
and dated it to 23,000 years ago.
That's incredible.

2340
02:15:35,550 --> 02:15:37,980
People were fucking doing some
crazy shit back then, man.

2341
02:15:38,370 --> 02:15:42,670
People are hungry and they
were tired of deer. Yeah.

2342
02:15:42,671 --> 02:15:46,080
And well cows and like we were saying,
man, they just, they keep going.

2343
02:15:46,350 --> 02:15:50,040
People keep going. They came here for
fucking Africa. Even if they, this, these,

2344
02:15:50,090 --> 02:15:55,080
these dudes that went from Africa all
the way to Siberia and then they died

2345
02:15:55,081 --> 02:15:58,200
there. Was it that hot? It was
the heat that did it right.

2346
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:02,430
Could be a million,
no food competition,

2347
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:05,510
no food driven away by predators,

2348
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:09,400
driven away by other humans who knows.
Mature in a way that fight,

2349
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:13,050
we got to keep it. There's a lot
in between Africa and Russia.

2350
02:16:13,830 --> 02:16:18,330
And if they were doing it on foot
fucking a man 40,000 years ago,

2351
02:16:18,331 --> 02:16:20,640
they might've been doing it on foot.
It's very possible.

2352
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:24,720
They probably might not have even
had horses just walking let's shoes.

2353
02:16:26,190 --> 02:16:28,440
They probably figured out choose
right or they might not need them.

2354
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:33,370
Leif leaf feet. I Dunno.
Have you ever seen that show?

2355
02:16:33,371 --> 02:16:37,210
Uh, I forget what it was called.
Dual survivor or something like that.

2356
02:16:37,510 --> 02:16:40,030
And there was two dudes and
they would go wandering around,

2357
02:16:40,150 --> 02:16:43,560
surviving in the woods.
Like their whole thing was survive.

2358
02:16:43,561 --> 02:16:45,460
And like they would do a
thing like survivor man,

2359
02:16:45,461 --> 02:16:48,370
but there was two of them was a
competition. No, they would just survive.

2360
02:16:48,790 --> 02:16:52,540
They would just show you how you would
create a a house and this is how you go

2361
02:16:52,541 --> 02:16:56,200
catch fish and this is how you
protect yourself from rainstorms.

2362
02:16:56,680 --> 02:17:00,730
But one dude, everywhere he went, he
would go barefoot. His name was Cody.

2363
02:17:00,731 --> 02:17:02,980
I think Cody,
he's got the nastiest feet of all time.

2364
02:17:03,330 --> 02:17:07,960
He is like thick calluses all over the
bottom of like a shoe because he never

2365
02:17:07,961 --> 02:17:11,320
takes his fucking, he never puts
his shoes on. He walks everywhere.

2366
02:17:11,570 --> 02:17:14,680
So the skin on his feet,
it was just hard as a rock,

2367
02:17:14,820 --> 02:17:19,230
Eh, this is disgusting. Pretty disgusting.
Proudly when he comes to people's plays,

2368
02:17:19,231 --> 02:17:21,300
they asked him to put shoes on.

2369
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:26,770
Yeah, they come out, Cody,

2370
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:28,510
Cody's coming over your house
and give him your slippers.

2371
02:17:29,770 --> 02:17:31,540
They know he keep him and keep him,
man,

2372
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:34,720
you got to cover those fucking nasty feet.
I eat in this house.

2373
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:37,510
I don't know what's flying off of your
feet while you're wandering around.

2374
02:17:38,780 --> 02:17:41,590
That is nasty. There's something
particularly offensive about feet.

2375
02:17:42,310 --> 02:17:43,840
Like someone can have some,
you know,

2376
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:47,200
you could have dry skin on your forearm
and it doesn't really bother people,

2377
02:17:47,350 --> 02:17:51,490
but if you got some, that's his
foot. He's rolling with a rock.

2378
02:17:52,060 --> 02:17:52,893
Why is he running it with?

2379
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:57,040
Is that a callous or like some type of
fungus, that white thing. Oh, that's a,

2380
02:17:57,310 --> 02:18:01,630
what am I looking at? Foot. But
no, it's two other things there.

2381
02:18:01,631 --> 02:18:05,350
It's a big toe. Okay. What does that,

2382
02:18:05,351 --> 02:18:09,700
that's his toe and his rap. Yeah. I think
what he's doing is his polling is tall,

2383
02:18:09,950 --> 02:18:14,690
rubbing it with a rock to make.
I thought the white part,

2384
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:17,930
I stopped. That was too much.
If I get hard, I'll get scared.

2385
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:25,220
I don't know why I made that choice.
I'm sure he knows about shoes.

2386
02:18:25,250 --> 02:18:27,680
It's gotta be a more effective strategy.
Marketing.

2387
02:18:29,310 --> 02:18:33,200
What does stand out to stand out
from the other? Gavi, more memorable.

2388
02:18:33,230 --> 02:18:36,650
Get mentioned on the Joe Rogan
podcast. That's a good point, man.

2389
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:40,610
It did work out because the other dude,
nobody knows who the fuck he is. Yeah.

2390
02:18:40,910 --> 02:18:44,060
That's so true. Marketing is
so important. Like what it was.

2391
02:18:44,061 --> 02:18:46,730
Everybody know about Einstein's
got this fucking crazy hair man.

2392
02:18:47,060 --> 02:18:51,030
Not just equals MC square. They know what
he looked like. It's all wild and Daddy.

2393
02:18:51,310 --> 02:18:54,980
Yup. Nikola Tesla. No one knows
that. That dude looks like nope. Why?

2394
02:18:55,010 --> 02:18:59,410
Because he was a slick little Croatian
dude. Very slim or wear a suit and tie.

2395
02:18:59,411 --> 02:19:02,120
Look normal. Yeah. Nobody
gives a fuck about that guy.

2396
02:19:02,810 --> 02:19:06,890
Nobody plays Nikola Tesla for Halloween.
But people would dress up like Einstein.

2397
02:19:06,891 --> 02:19:10,640
Everybody knows you're Einstein. Exactly.
You're right. Got To get you to look.

2398
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:14,900
Have you ever thought about a look like
perhaps like maybe something that people

2399
02:19:14,901 --> 02:19:16,490
will remember?
You mean you're talking about a case,

2400
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:21,410
a catchphrase for a pig hunting? Maybe.
Maybe you need to like, you know,

2401
02:19:21,470 --> 02:19:22,303
something.

2402
02:19:22,510 --> 02:19:25,760
What type of outfit or
something? Yeah. Uh,

2403
02:19:25,780 --> 02:19:27,650
get the same outfit time.

2404
02:19:28,510 --> 02:19:32,730
Nobody ever done that same outfit.
Yeah. Like a Bruce Lee outfit. Oh,

2405
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:36,170
like a Bruce Lee out? No. Bruce Lee,
where that game of death outfit.

2406
02:19:36,290 --> 02:19:39,140
And if you see anybody in a yellow
track suit with black stripes,

2407
02:19:39,141 --> 02:19:43,820
you automatically think of Bruce Lee.
Remember we fought Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

2408
02:19:44,010 --> 02:19:47,690
He had the track suit. I don't remember
if it was, don't remember, dude.

2409
02:19:47,770 --> 02:19:51,200
I see nursing that tracksuit.
Come on.

2410
02:19:51,270 --> 02:19:55,140
I haven't seen a lot of the
essential movies or television.

2411
02:19:55,470 --> 02:19:57,840
I know has seen Bruce Lee movies.
I see it.

2412
02:19:57,841 --> 02:20:02,841
A couple Gabriel Iglesias as a comic
that does that with his shorts.

2413
02:20:03,690 --> 02:20:05,250
That's a good point.
And he has the,

2414
02:20:05,270 --> 02:20:10,140
he has the in a silhouette of him
behind it as part of his stage set. Oh,

2415
02:20:10,141 --> 02:20:11,430
does he always?
Yeah.

2416
02:20:11,490 --> 02:20:15,930
I always shorts and a Hawaiian shirt
or something and always a silhouette.

2417
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:19,500
Even when he's at clubs, not a
silhouette but like a, like a,

2418
02:20:19,501 --> 02:20:21,630
that logo will be behind them.

2419
02:20:21,631 --> 02:20:24,240
And now I'm talking about for
specials on TV for a special. Yeah.

2420
02:20:24,241 --> 02:20:27,210
And probably if he played,
he played, he's like, yeah,

2421
02:20:27,390 --> 02:20:30,450
he was places so probably had some
type of set piece or something.

2422
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:34,130
He does huge places. Any does clubs
too. Like Gabriel, we'll do like a,

2423
02:20:34,190 --> 02:20:38,900
he'll do like nine shows in a
week and do like a 6:00 PM show.

2424
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:43,130
He'll do an 8:00 PM show, a 10:00
PM show and a midnight show. Yeah,

2425
02:20:43,270 --> 02:20:45,920
he's crazy like that.
He does a early shows for kids.

2426
02:20:45,921 --> 02:20:50,690
Like families can come to like a 5:00
PM show when it's light out. Wow. He,

2427
02:20:50,691 --> 02:20:54,530
I think he holds the record for the most
consecutive sellouts at the ice house.

2428
02:20:54,830 --> 02:20:57,470
Sold out like some insane
amount of shows in a row.

2429
02:20:57,471 --> 02:20:58,820
Like he was there for two weeks in a row,

2430
02:20:58,821 --> 02:21:01,970
like every day does Monday
night shows and shit.

2431
02:21:02,170 --> 02:21:05,560
I haven't seen him live. I've seen
he brings a lot of people with them.

2432
02:21:05,561 --> 02:21:10,240
Brings like a lot of stand ups. Supports
a lot of dudes. Yeah. Just he, he like,

2433
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:15,130
you know, supports the, he's a genuinely
good guy. Like a, as far as like,

2434
02:21:15,190 --> 02:21:20,120
I remember, uh, Trevor Noah used to tour
with him and he traveled and he gave her,

2435
02:21:20,121 --> 02:21:21,630
he was like,
you gotta get merged man.

2436
02:21:21,670 --> 02:21:26,530
And so Gabriel got them some certs made
up and then Travis said he was killing

2437
02:21:26,531 --> 02:21:28,060
it on Mertz after shows and shit.

2438
02:21:28,220 --> 02:21:30,950
Yeah. People love to buy shit.
If you've got a catch phrase,

2439
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,580
that's something Bam,
Bam will eating him.

2440
02:21:35,390 --> 02:21:40,190
Joe Rogan need to make
one man. Come on, dude,

2441
02:21:40,250 --> 02:21:44,690
do it. We'll go. We'll take you pig
hunting and when, when you kill a pig,

2442
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:46,670
you got to say that. Yeah.
That'll be your shit.

2443
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,890
And then we'll start making tee shirts.
Definitely.

2444
02:21:48,950 --> 02:21:51,320
You don't get high when you hunt.
Do you know?

2445
02:21:54,110 --> 02:21:58,010
I mean, I know people who do. I know
a dude who dear Hans. Hi. Yeah. Yeah.

2446
02:21:58,011 --> 02:22:02,270
He likes it. He's an old
hippie. Yah. The smokes.

2447
02:22:02,271 --> 02:22:05,360
A little weed and cause out there and
we ain't don't look like a Hippie,

2448
02:22:05,361 --> 02:22:08,990
but there's a lot of hippie in him.
He loves to take a one hitter,

2449
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:12,380
take a blast and then go out
and go hunting. She was like,

2450
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:13,610
you're more in tune with nature.

2451
02:22:13,740 --> 02:22:17,760
Yeah. I feel like if I shot an animal
high, I freak out. Like, oh no,

2452
02:22:18,810 --> 02:22:20,160
just taking life.

2453
02:22:20,460 --> 02:22:25,110
It was was alive now because
of my actions. It is alive.

2454
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:26,060
Yeah.

2455
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:27,300
It pretty common probably.
Yeah,

2456
02:22:27,330 --> 02:22:30,420
but you wouldn't get bummed out if
you went and bought a cheeseburger.

2457
02:22:30,421 --> 02:22:33,480
If I went to in and out.
You're so disconnected from the process.

2458
02:22:33,630 --> 02:22:36,130
Just deliciousness.
This is real fast too.

2459
02:22:36,690 --> 02:22:39,690
Do you think that's a part
of human evolution is that
there's a reason why we're

2460
02:22:39,691 --> 02:22:44,070
moving past this whole hunting gathering
thing and that in the future that not

2461
02:22:44,071 --> 02:22:48,210
only will not be necessary, but like we
won't even have those desires anymore?

2462
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:53,610
No, I think it's, this is a convenience
man. People got jobs as shit.

2463
02:22:53,611 --> 02:22:57,780
We can't be shooting
pigs for sure, for sure.

2464
02:22:57,781 --> 02:23:02,520
But your lifestyle can sustain that.
That you know,

2465
02:23:02,550 --> 02:23:06,290
going out there and waiting for
two hours and taking a side,

2466
02:23:06,300 --> 02:23:10,650
it's good at it and then cutting it and
putting it on the grill and doing all

2467
02:23:10,651 --> 02:23:14,070
that. That is cool. But you know,
the reason food is processed,

2468
02:23:14,071 --> 02:23:16,710
how it is is just because people don't
have time to be fucking with that.

2469
02:23:16,990 --> 02:23:20,140
Absolutely. I mean people with regular
jobs absolutely don't have time,

2470
02:23:20,141 --> 02:23:23,670
but there's also people don't
want to be a part of it. Yeah.

2471
02:23:24,050 --> 02:23:28,780
People are moving away from
it and I wonder if that is
all a part of the process

2472
02:23:28,781 --> 02:23:31,660
that's going to lead people
to develop artificial food.

2473
02:23:31,661 --> 02:23:35,590
It's just like food that you get from
animals because they've already figured

2474
02:23:35,591 --> 02:23:37,750
out how to do that.
They've already made science.

2475
02:23:37,810 --> 02:23:40,870
They figured out how to make some
sort of an artificial steak and it was

2476
02:23:40,871 --> 02:23:42,070
unbelievably expensive,

2477
02:23:42,071 --> 02:23:46,060
like $250,000 or something like that
to create this meat that they grew in a

2478
02:23:46,061 --> 02:23:47,890
test tube or in a laboratory somewhere.

2479
02:23:48,310 --> 02:23:53,310
But I think that maybe like that's
like the first echoes of this sort of

2480
02:23:53,561 --> 02:23:54,970
cultural shift from,

2481
02:23:55,180 --> 02:24:00,180
from being hunter gatherers to being
able to go to the grocery store too.

2482
02:24:00,550 --> 02:24:04,630
There's no need to kill an animal because
we're going to make artificial meat

2483
02:24:04,810 --> 02:24:08,680
and everybody would just eat
scientifically created meat that's totally

2484
02:24:08,681 --> 02:24:09,850
nutritious and healthy.

2485
02:24:10,220 --> 02:24:13,810
They'll fuck it up for a couple of
years and some of it will, you know,

2486
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:17,170
some people get like some weird crones
disease and shit like that from the

2487
02:24:17,171 --> 02:24:19,510
artificial meat,
but then eventually they'll get it down.

2488
02:24:19,511 --> 02:24:21,730
So it's even more nutritious
than like wild game.

2489
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:26,350
I don't know if I want to go that route.
I don't know either.

2490
02:24:26,351 --> 02:24:30,580
But I think it's inevitable. Yeah. Yeah,
I think so. I think there's a reason why.

2491
02:24:30,610 --> 02:24:33,520
Um, I think it's the transition. There's
a reason why people find hunting.

2492
02:24:33,521 --> 02:24:35,980
Just tasteful. Even people,
some people that eat meat,

2493
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:38,260
they don't even want to
know how the animal dies.

2494
02:24:38,261 --> 02:24:39,790
They don't want to be a part of it.
They don't want,

2495
02:24:39,791 --> 02:24:42,460
they certainly don't want to see a video
and they definitely don't want to go

2496
02:24:42,461 --> 02:24:47,230
shoot an animal. Right. So why do they
like meat? Like why are they so good?

2497
02:24:47,420 --> 02:24:50,170
It's delicious, but why are they okay
with that? Cause I think there's like,

2498
02:24:50,380 --> 02:24:54,040
that's like the bridge between
us and then the new us,

2499
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:58,570
which just figures out how to do
everything synthetically just recreate it.

2500
02:24:58,760 --> 02:25:00,070
Just like they could recreate every,

2501
02:25:00,071 --> 02:25:02,410
I mean they're going to
recreate people for sure.

2502
02:25:02,470 --> 02:25:05,590
If we stay alive for
another thousand years,

2503
02:25:05,740 --> 02:25:08,680
if human beings are still on this planet,
a thousand years from now,

2504
02:25:09,250 --> 02:25:11,740
we will have artificial humans
that are indistinguishable.

2505
02:25:11,780 --> 02:25:14,080
It'll be some a hundred
percent blade runner shit

2506
02:25:15,870 --> 02:25:19,770
about, yeah, I feel like a thousand
years is going to get weird. I kinda, I,

2507
02:25:19,870 --> 02:25:23,740
I sometimes I think about the future and
give bummed out that I won't get to see

2508
02:25:23,741 --> 02:25:24,460
how crazy

2509
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:28,750
it is. You might just based on how it
is, the shift has been doing my lifetime.

2510
02:25:28,751 --> 02:25:30,880
You say I might, you might,
it might be so crazy.

2511
02:25:30,881 --> 02:25:32,740
You might actually get to
see 500 years from now.

2512
02:25:33,540 --> 02:25:35,070
Bullshitting man. The, the, the,

2513
02:25:35,071 --> 02:25:39,000
if you pay attention to guys like Ray
Kurzweil and all these futurists that are

2514
02:25:39,210 --> 02:25:42,330
at the cusp of technology
that really understand the,

2515
02:25:42,331 --> 02:25:44,430
what innovations are being created,

2516
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:47,430
all the different things they
have on the pipeline. Yeah.

2517
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:49,530
They're getting pretty close
to getting pretty clear.

2518
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:53,590
They say that the person that's alive
today is going to be the first person to

2519
02:25:53,591 --> 02:25:56,400
live to be 150 years old.
Yeah.

2520
02:25:56,430 --> 02:26:01,430
And they think that that's just today
that that person will probably be alive to

2521
02:26:01,531 --> 02:26:06,000
meet a person lives to be a thousand.
I just ended that. I just made that up.

2522
02:26:06,650 --> 02:26:11,540
Let me see if it is only made up the
part about that person will probably be,

2523
02:26:11,541 --> 02:26:15,710
yeah, but the 150 thing, that's pretty
much consensus. 50 I mean that's a lot,

2524
02:26:15,711 --> 02:26:20,210
but yeah, it feels more feasible cause
what is the latest had been 117 hundred 20

2525
02:26:20,211 --> 02:26:22,910
something like that or it's hard to
tell because it's hard to find out who's

2526
02:26:22,911 --> 02:26:24,410
telling the truth when
they get to be that old.

2527
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:27,680
Those are all constantly to fuck a
paperwork. Fuck, they ain't got nothing.

2528
02:26:27,710 --> 02:26:31,210
Nothing to lose. The weight
is going to challenge them
like, yeah, you do look, oh,

2529
02:26:31,211 --> 02:26:34,280
his foot. We believed
you. What's the point?

2530
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:39,020
Society needs this story. Anyway.
Yeah. Who is, let's take a guess.

2531
02:26:39,021 --> 02:26:41,690
I'm going to say 122 years old.
Oh,

2532
02:26:41,691 --> 02:26:46,691
the Otis and I think is one 17
one 18 is the oldest person.

2533
02:26:46,940 --> 02:26:51,680
Let's find out right now.
Oldest person ever was 116 years old,

2534
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:56,990
oldest living person.
The oldest ever was 122 oh wow.

2535
02:26:57,260 --> 02:27:02,000
Yeah. She's from France. What about
the, what about those Bible folks?

2536
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:07,670
Oh, the 600 year old know.
What about those folks?

2537
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:12,320
Well, I think their calendars
with dog shit back then.
They will talk about weeks.

2538
02:27:13,340 --> 02:27:17,870
Calendars. We've written down stones.
Happy Birthday is Monday. Yeah.

2539
02:27:17,871 --> 02:27:22,130
The idea that those people lived 600
years. That's Hilarious, but what if,

2540
02:27:22,220 --> 02:27:26,780
what if back then what was going on is
they were super technologically advanced

2541
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:30,620
and then the flood came along.
They had to start from scratch.

2542
02:27:31,210 --> 02:27:33,140
It would have no,
really was

2543
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:37,000
600 years old because no was a part of
an ancient civilization that was far more

2544
02:27:37,001 --> 02:27:40,320
advanced. That's why God got
pissed. These motherfuckers,

2545
02:27:40,330 --> 02:27:44,110
these dummies are living to be 600
years old. All right. Fuck this.

2546
02:27:44,500 --> 02:27:46,860
I'm just going to start with Noah.
I'm just going to know.

2547
02:27:46,870 --> 02:27:50,650
You seem like a good guy, but
yeah. Well it's ridiculous.

2548
02:27:51,550 --> 02:27:55,270
It's also ridiculous that we are
the children of Noah's incest.

2549
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:59,470
Yeah. Was it? No. Was it
assessed? Who else is who,

2550
02:27:59,580 --> 02:28:02,370
who fucks? I mean, how many people were
left? It's no one. How many people?

2551
02:28:02,371 --> 02:28:03,204
His family,
right?

2552
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:06,870
Oh, you mean, oh, you mean?
Yeah, his incest. Uh, yeah.

2553
02:28:06,990 --> 02:28:10,710
I mean he didn't bring her on a bunch
of hot Swedish chicks for excellent

2554
02:28:10,711 --> 02:28:13,350
genetic material on the shoot
loads and to all of them, he,

2555
02:28:13,360 --> 02:28:15,900
even if he did just that small gene pool,

2556
02:28:15,970 --> 02:28:19,500
have no abroad over 50 people
and just fuck those 50 chicks.

2557
02:28:19,740 --> 02:28:22,880
It was just him in 50 checks.
The whole human race would be a mess.

2558
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:25,850
The whole human race.
It's all crazy.

2559
02:28:25,851 --> 02:28:29,300
Interbreeding or that w would take
generations to fucking fix all that shit,

2560
02:28:29,480 --> 02:28:34,270
right? Yeah. Yes. Nah, I'm not
a, that stuff is all goofy.

2561
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:39,320
It's goofy stuff is definitely
goofy. But, uh, uh, there,

2562
02:28:39,321 --> 02:28:43,310
there still is this people to this day,
it's still believe it have giant,

2563
02:28:43,370 --> 02:28:44,330
a giant percentage

2564
02:28:44,610 --> 02:28:48,450
giant. That's 100%. It's very
passionate about it. So it's a,

2565
02:28:49,230 --> 02:28:52,230
I try not to get into it with those
types. What do you know? I mean, I don't,

2566
02:28:52,231 --> 02:28:52,620
I don't,

2567
02:28:52,620 --> 02:28:57,110
I'm never in situations where I'm talking
with a religious person or debate.

2568
02:28:57,150 --> 02:29:01,230
I talk about it and my stand up a little
bit and uh, pretty much that's it.

2569
02:29:01,231 --> 02:29:04,380
But it is, it does baffle me a little
bit. When people get mad on Twitter,

2570
02:29:04,650 --> 02:29:07,810
the world's go up to the Muslims.
You always go on after us Christians,

2571
02:29:08,110 --> 02:29:12,190
first of all, because Muslims are
a more dangerous target. Dummy

2572
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:17,500
pretending it. And second of all, because
you're right here, you're right here,

2573
02:29:17,501 --> 02:29:20,320
right here in America, land of the
free home. They believe in zombies.

2574
02:29:20,321 --> 02:29:24,400
Family as Christa's. Yeah. More relatable.

2575
02:29:24,580 --> 02:29:29,350
I grew up Christian. So is this
a different yeah. Yeah. This is,

2576
02:29:29,351 --> 02:29:34,000
uh, this is also a much more ridiculous
place to get hoodwinked. You know,

2577
02:29:34,001 --> 02:29:38,260
we're not living in some backwards
fucking crazy culture that's run by some,

2578
02:29:38,410 --> 02:29:42,640
well, sort of are, but not as
much. So as these ancient cultures,

2579
02:29:42,840 --> 02:29:44,770
there's cultures that have been,
you know, they're, they're,

2580
02:29:44,771 --> 02:29:47,650
they have a lot of their ideas about
what people shouldn't, shouldn't do,

2581
02:29:47,651 --> 02:29:50,260
or thousands of years old.
They just stuck him. Right.

2582
02:29:51,470 --> 02:29:51,900
Yeah.

2583
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:56,900
This is really weird that I talk about
people getting the Holy Ghost sometimes.

2584
02:29:57,871 --> 02:30:02,620
You all, that's great. I love that
the Pentecostals and a baptist,

2585
02:30:02,621 --> 02:30:03,454
when people just like

2586
02:30:04,570 --> 02:30:05,370
really

2587
02:30:05,370 --> 02:30:07,270
that are you doing that is that,

2588
02:30:07,271 --> 02:30:11,850
that it makes you feel like that the
Lord makes you, Dan speaking in tongues,

2589
02:30:11,851 --> 02:30:13,930
speaking in tongues.
Is that you did you,

2590
02:30:13,980 --> 02:30:17,310
did you just want to do
that and use this hat,

2591
02:30:17,311 --> 02:30:21,810
this excuse using religion as an excuse.
Like I used to speak at what does,

2592
02:30:21,980 --> 02:30:22,451
is this,

2593
02:30:22,451 --> 02:30:26,900
that s that's confusing when it's just
when they were living in turns into a

2594
02:30:26,910 --> 02:30:30,240
reason for people to just act
out and be weird publicly.

2595
02:30:30,360 --> 02:30:34,920
I like when they do it on TV. You ever see
Robert Tilden? You know, that guy is uh,

2596
02:30:35,220 --> 02:30:38,040
probably by face if he's a,
if he's a religious dude,

2597
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:41,820
he's one of the most ridiculous
all time dudes. But uh, he,

2598
02:30:41,821 --> 02:30:43,570
he would like in the
middle of it broadcast

2599
02:30:43,670 --> 02:30:48,580
hosts. So solar, Macula, it just totally,

2600
02:30:48,581 --> 02:30:51,970
completely obviously fake language.
And he was making it up on the spot.

2601
02:30:52,030 --> 02:30:55,150
Very repetitive.
Very unlike a real language.

2602
02:30:55,320 --> 02:30:57,160
It varies and tone and,

2603
02:30:57,161 --> 02:31:00,640
and sounds and creative with some alarm

2604
02:31:03,850 --> 02:31:06,850
keeps repeating the same sounds
over and over again. Stinks.

2605
02:31:08,700 --> 02:31:12,490
Because I can understand.
I understand the structure of it as him.

2606
02:31:14,370 --> 02:31:15,970
Is he speaking in tongues here?

2607
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:20,010
We'll also

2608
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:24,300
provide and multiply. That's the
opening of the windows of heaven.

2609
02:31:24,750 --> 02:31:27,670
This is, oh, this is the
farming preacher video. Yeah.

2610
02:31:28,290 --> 02:31:32,910
I want to hear him talking in tongues.
Yeah. They putting fart sounds while he's,

2611
02:31:33,140 --> 02:31:35,430
it's very juvenile.
Youtube is free.

2612
02:31:35,810 --> 02:31:40,090
There is, yeah. I'm gonna take this
preacher fart sounds. Gunshot noises.

2613
02:31:40,580 --> 02:31:43,080
You know what this needs,
I'm until a super cut of

2614
02:31:43,770 --> 02:31:47,690

it so it looks like he's singing to this.

2615
02:31:48,050 --> 02:31:51,010
You know what else?
The Internet figured out that uh,

2616
02:31:51,140 --> 02:31:55,690
people outside the Internet ever
figured out memes. Those memes. Yeah.

2617
02:31:55,880 --> 02:31:59,810
Pictures like a picture, a picture
of you. Bam, Bam. We're eating ham.

2618
02:32:01,650 --> 02:32:04,880

doubt someone has made that.

2619
02:32:04,910 --> 02:32:07,220
It's already happening without a doubt.

2620

a doubt. I guarantee you it's up there.

2627
02:32:33,380 --> 02:32:35,330

By the end of this broadcast,

2628
02:32:35,450 --> 02:32:39,380
someone will at least be working on it.
That's the beauty of the Internet.

2629
02:32:39,430 --> 02:32:41,930
It is crazy. Oh, it's the
greatest thing ever, man.

2630
02:32:42,020 --> 02:32:44,490
We're so lucky as comics to to,

2631
02:32:44,540 --> 02:32:48,110
to be able to release specialists
and shit in this time. Yeah.

2632
02:32:48,111 --> 02:32:51,410
Like your special is going to be on
comedy central Air Saturday night. Yeah.

But it also, you could get it online
right now. Right. Right. Foot up.

2634
02:32:55,941 --> 02:33:00,800
People that don't want to wait, they want
to go get that shit by the way. Get it.

2635
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:04,370
And can you play it on iPads and
everything? It's everything. Yeah.

2636
02:33:04,460 --> 02:33:08,330
You can play it on your phone. Everything.

2637
02:33:08,570 --> 02:33:11,810
That's beautiful. Yeah. See, look at
that. This is a beautiful time for,

2638
02:33:12,020 --> 02:33:16,310
for standup distribution. Instant
access where we could say, hey man,

2639
02:33:16,311 --> 02:33:20,510
Hannibal's a funny motherfucker. You
need to go see live from Chicago. Boom.

2640
02:33:20,570 --> 02:33:24,100
Someone to go online and at the end
of my sentence, they're already in.

2641
02:33:24,680 --> 02:33:28,700
They're already clicking in and yeah,
it's incredible. Is a good sign. Yeah.

2642
02:33:28,701 --> 02:33:29,750
Making it out.
Boom.

2643
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:34,130
And that's the, that's what the
Amazon one click. The beautiful,

2644
02:33:34,980 --> 02:33:39,210
the beauty is of Twitter and things like
that too, is I find out about new music.

2645
02:33:39,220 --> 02:33:43,770
I'll find out about news and different
things. Or if I'm in New York, you know,

2646
02:33:43,771 --> 02:33:47,510
I might just search. If I am, I'll
search. Oh, the city that I'm in,

2647
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:52,520
I just started this city events and
I'll find out this person is playing a

2648
02:33:52,531 --> 02:33:54,360
concert. I didn't even know what
they have planned, a concert,

2649
02:33:54,361 --> 02:33:57,420
but I found out about it through
Twitter or just saying, hey,

2650
02:33:57,810 --> 02:34:00,150
what's the best restaurant here in Denver?

2651
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:03,120
You have people give you restaurant
suggestions and then you'd go and

2652
02:34:03,121 --> 02:34:06,930
[inaudible] is great. So that's
the, that's the beauty of a,

2653
02:34:06,931 --> 02:34:11,931
of Twitter and the immediacy
of the Internet is that
access and just having that

2654
02:34:12,391 --> 02:34:13,860
information and being able to use it.

2655
02:34:13,950 --> 02:34:18,100
Fuck yeah. Um, I use, uh, because
I'm, I use an android phone. I use

2656
02:34:18,370 --> 02:34:22,870
Amazon. Yeah. And so, uh, I
use Amazon for, for music,

2657
02:34:22,871 --> 02:34:26,820
for comedy, for anything. And
I was coming home from, uh,

2658
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:30,840
the Improv in Irvine and I said, I need
to hear some fucking new comedy. I'm like,

2659
02:34:31,060 --> 02:34:34,090
everybody keeps telling you this.

this, I got animal furnace, dude,

2661
02:34:37,721 --> 02:34:42,130

within 10 minutes, within 10 minutes,

2662
02:34:42,131 --> 02:34:44,440
I had it on my, on my
knee. I mean, not even,

2663
02:34:44,441 --> 02:34:47,800
I was driving and I was playing
it within like 30 seconds. Right.

2664
02:34:47,801 --> 02:34:50,530
And the whole thing was downloaded
within a couple of minutes just on,

2665
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:54,790
I only had three g at the time.
I couldn't even get four g and boom,

2666
02:34:55,270 --> 02:34:57,630
it's on your phone and you're listening
while you're driving. It's amazing.

2667
02:34:57,720 --> 02:35:00,720
Ed is good to like issues with fas.

2668
02:35:00,721 --> 02:35:05,720
Like I had one where a specialist
Chicago, some of this, but yeah,

2669
02:35:05,730 --> 02:35:09,540
when I shot the special, uh, the
ticket price was kind of low,

2670
02:35:09,541 --> 02:35:13,960
so it got scalped Kinda have you got
scalped and scalp was well in lies.

2671
02:35:14,100 --> 02:35:18,660
I mean people writing me saying, uh, I
want to come to your show, but you know,

2672
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:22,170
fuck it, I'm paying $200 for this
scalper and I was like, fuck that.

2673
02:35:22,171 --> 02:35:26,370
They'll pay 200 bucks.
You can donate to this charity,

2674
02:35:26,371 --> 02:35:30,540
mercy home and screen screen cap,

donate it and I'll put you on my guest

2676
02:35:34,681 --> 02:35:39,180
list. You know what I mean? But that's
just through Twitter. Twitter, I just be,

2677
02:35:39,220 --> 02:35:41,680
I just have angry fans.
Ryan's got,

2678
02:35:41,681 --> 02:35:44,790
it was probably still this
angry fans by scalped tickets,

2679
02:35:44,791 --> 02:35:48,000
but I was able to at least in a
couple situations with shows up,

2680
02:35:48,001 --> 02:35:50,400
it's sold out or shows the biggest scout.

2681
02:35:50,401 --> 02:35:52,580
I'm able to put somebody on
my guest list just cause they,

2682
02:35:52,581 --> 02:35:54,750
if they donate to that charity,
that's beautiful.

2683
02:35:54,751 --> 02:35:58,730
What's the charity with mercy home and
what is mercy home Diversey in Chicago is

2684
02:35:58,740 --> 02:36:01,650

young black kids to Chicago,

2685
02:36:01,651 --> 02:36:06,240
just a w programs and says educates and
after school programs and things like

2686
02:36:06,241 --> 02:36:06,430
that.

2687
02:36:06,430 --> 02:36:09,790
That's amazing, man. That's a great
idea. That's a really great idea.

2688
02:36:09,970 --> 02:36:13,030
You are you from Chicago?
From Chicago because Ari Shaffir went,

2689
02:36:13,031 --> 02:36:14,420
we were in Chicago.
Ariana,

2690
02:36:15,170 --> 02:36:18,790
y'all went near town. It's the
same, yeah. UFC what's happened?

2691
02:36:18,980 --> 02:36:23,010
Yeah, we did the Chicago theater Friday
night and then already went and go,

2692
02:36:23,090 --> 02:36:25,550
went and checked you out.
Was it Friday night or Saturday night?

2693
02:36:25,551 --> 02:36:26,930
It was Saturday on that shot.
Yeah.

2694
02:36:27,020 --> 02:36:31,220
So he went and checked you out I think
after the fights were over. Yeah. Yeah.

2695
02:36:31,221 --> 02:36:34,850
I think he went there right after the
fights were over and checked out your

2696
02:36:34,851 --> 02:36:38,090
special, yeah. That's cool man.
Where'd you play in Chicago to visit?

2697
02:36:38,660 --> 02:36:42,080
So that was this show. That was this
show. Oh, so this is fresh, man.

2698
02:36:42,100 --> 02:36:44,190
This is fresh out of the box.
It's only a couple of months ago.

2699
02:36:44,750 --> 02:36:46,820
We turned it over fast. Fast. Was that,

2700
02:36:46,821 --> 02:36:50,540
when was it as a two area filled?

2701
02:36:50,541 --> 02:36:54,290
January 25th wow. Damn,
that's perfect though.

2702
02:36:54,560 --> 02:36:58,280
That way you get there. There'll probably
be some jokes on TV if they're topical.

2703
02:36:58,310 --> 02:37:01,580
Like do you have anything topical that
like, is that still applicable today?

2704
02:37:01,770 --> 02:37:05,280
Uh, nothing really topic. Let's
talk about music a little bit.

2705
02:37:05,281 --> 02:37:10,110
Current music and things like that,
but nothing political but the beach boys.

2706
02:37:10,140 --> 02:37:11,940
What's up the things to the beach boys

2707
02:37:11,990 --> 02:37:16,010
a lot. These fucking monkeys and
Duran Duran, they're so weird.

2708
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:19,200
They always Duran Duran and

2709
02:37:20,070 --> 02:37:22,150
too sexy. The too, there's
something about him.

2710
02:37:22,151 --> 02:37:24,010
I don't like how symmetrical they are.
Yeah.

2711
02:37:24,340 --> 02:37:27,190
It's what I always appreciated about
Keith Richards and Mick Jagger.

2712
02:37:27,250 --> 02:37:29,770
They're kind of ugly to
kind of fucked up login.

2713
02:37:29,890 --> 02:37:33,130
I liked my music to come
out of some people that live
in the experience of pain.

2714
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:34,810
Yeah. Bam, Bam, Wheaton.

2715
02:37:37,410 --> 02:37:42,240
It's impossible to avoid.
Gives us no first the right pitch for it.

2716
02:37:42,360 --> 02:37:45,630
It's a great picture. It's
the right picture for it.
You're smiling with your TV,

2717
02:37:45,631 --> 02:37:47,830
teeth, your eyes, Davey tape.

2718
02:37:49,470 --> 02:37:54,330
Um, so, uh, besides your
special, uh, where else can
people find your tour dates?

2719
02:37:54,610 --> 02:37:59,570
It's turned, I saw my website is Hannibal
buress.com. Um, I think, yeah. Yeah.

2720
02:37:59,690 --> 02:38:02,800
I only got a few days coming up while
I try to get this new shit together.

2721
02:38:03,360 --> 02:38:06,520
Yeah. Oh, that's right man.
That's the thing, right? Yeah.

2722
02:38:06,580 --> 02:38:08,310
You got to abandon the old and come up.

2723
02:38:08,370 --> 02:38:12,060
Let's Amanda. No, they'll go half and half
a sub. So I'm working on it, but yeah,

2724
02:38:12,061 --> 02:38:15,060
it Hannibal Buress Dotcom
and I'm in a, you know, on,

2725
02:38:15,061 --> 02:38:18,750
at the knitting factory in
Brooklyn on Sundays. Every Sunday.

2726
02:38:18,780 --> 02:38:23,220
Every Sunday if a less amount of role.
But this Sunday coming up I'm hosting. Oh,

2727
02:38:23,221 --> 02:38:23,490
that's right.

2728
02:38:23,490 --> 02:38:26,860
Cool. So you host dare, like, like you
were talking about doing shows where the,

2729
02:38:27,180 --> 02:38:28,390
you bring up your friends is that we,

2730
02:38:28,660 --> 02:38:31,900
yeah. Bring a friends and have
musical guests. Like, cause we have a,

2731
02:38:32,140 --> 02:38:32,710
we have a rent.

2732
02:38:32,710 --> 02:38:36,040
It's the front barn and we had a main
room that holds about 300 so that's what I

2733
02:38:36,041 --> 02:38:40,440
have a couple of musical
guests. Oh, that's awesome.
That's a great idea. So yes,

2734
02:38:40,480 --> 02:38:43,960
just act Bridget Everett this song. That's
amazing. Have you seen Bridget Everett?

2735
02:38:43,990 --> 02:38:48,730
No, no, no. He's just like just
sorta comedy, Cabaret Sing and act.

2736
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:53,500
But like gets the crazy reaction from
the crowd. People split when they see it.

2737
02:38:53,800 --> 02:38:58,090
What would sort of, what's a unique about
it is just really good. Really good.

2738
02:38:58,091 --> 02:38:59,710
She's a good,
she's a great singer,

2739
02:38:59,740 --> 02:39:03,310
but then she also interacts with the
crowd in a way where she'll just put a

2740
02:39:03,311 --> 02:39:08,311
random crowd members face into her
titties was in the middle of a song and

2741
02:39:09,641 --> 02:39:12,310
she'll ride or walk around.
It's a, it's a crazy,

2742
02:39:12,311 --> 02:39:17,311
just is perfect live at I guess what
of those acts two where it's alive and

2743
02:39:17,710 --> 02:39:20,650
well, you could watch it on,
you might have videos up,

2744
02:39:20,651 --> 02:39:25,180
you could watch it and be like, oh, that's
cool. But you see her live, it's like, oh,

2745
02:39:25,181 --> 02:39:30,070
the shit watching people watch
is I like to watch out of the,

2746
02:39:30,140 --> 02:39:31,560
you know,
you see people's reaction.

2747
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:34,930
I'm has some cats that only come and
usually see standard with my show,

2748
02:39:34,931 --> 02:39:39,560
but they are watching her like, what
the fuck is going on? But she's uh, eh,

2749
02:39:39,670 --> 02:39:44,000
she was real good. Uh, and
then got Michael Che on that
show right there. Yeah. Yes.

2750
02:39:44,001 --> 02:39:45,700
All right there.
Let me hear some of this.

2751
02:39:57,370 --> 02:40:01,360
Wow. What an aggressive woman. Not
a man. Can't handle that handle.

2752
02:40:02,140 --> 02:40:04,240
A lot of men get confused.
A woman like that.

2753
02:40:08,520 --> 02:40:09,600
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2754
02:40:09,870 --> 02:40:12,960
She's finds an audience dude and sits
in his lap and she's sweating all over.

2755
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:18,930
And I bet that chick sweats a lot.
That's hilarious.

2756
02:40:19,060 --> 02:40:22,970
So you do this every Sunday. His show
is every Sunday. Whether I'm that. Yeah.

2757
02:40:23,220 --> 02:40:25,210
What made you decide to start
doing something like that?

2758
02:40:25,240 --> 02:40:26,440
How did you get that started?

2759
02:40:26,530 --> 02:40:29,340
It was when it was an old nine.
Uh,

2760
02:40:29,380 --> 02:40:33,730
I had just started writing for Saturday
night live and I did the opening night

2761
02:40:33,731 --> 02:40:34,451
at the native factor.

2762
02:40:34,451 --> 02:40:37,570
It used to be in downtown Manhattan
and it moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

2763
02:40:37,571 --> 02:40:41,710
I did open night opening night there,
opening for this band, the savvy five.

2764
02:40:41,770 --> 02:40:45,490
And then they uh, the, the management,
they said we want to do a comedy night.

2765
02:40:45,491 --> 02:40:47,870
And so at the time I was writing
it Saturday night laughs.

2766
02:40:47,871 --> 02:40:51,310
So my only open night was a Sunday nights.

2767
02:40:51,730 --> 02:40:53,290
So I just started doing it and it,

2768
02:40:53,680 --> 02:40:57,760
and it's built over time with built an
audience. Like it used to be, you know,

2769
02:40:58,060 --> 02:41:01,600
patsy yard, he's like, you know,
it gets 20 people here at 30 feet,

2770
02:41:01,601 --> 02:41:03,320
but it's now it's packed all the time.

2771
02:41:03,321 --> 02:41:06,220
And a lot of people drop in
and Louie's been through.

2772
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:08,320
Chris rock comes through a little bit.

2773
02:41:08,321 --> 02:41:10,840
Chappelle's been through
was Amy Schumer cubs,

2774
02:41:10,841 --> 02:41:12,730
like a lot of people
come through to work out.

2775
02:41:12,740 --> 02:41:16,320
It's a savvy crowds is high
energy and it's a lot of fun.

2776
02:41:16,330 --> 02:41:18,410
That's what I try out my new shit.
And this is kind of my,

2777
02:41:18,460 --> 02:41:20,920
it's two blocks from my place,
which is very convenient.

2778
02:41:20,980 --> 02:41:22,570
Oh Wow.
So you can walk to work,

2779
02:41:22,700 --> 02:41:26,540
walks out at nine o'clock show.
Sometimes I'm in the shower at eight 50

2780
02:41:26,630 --> 02:41:28,790
now. You told people though,
but this is the problem.

2781
02:41:28,791 --> 02:41:33,380
Now that freaks are going to get near
that area and scan out in a two block grid

2782
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:37,640
and try to figure out where we're
Hannibal lives. I'm moving in.

2783
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:39,670
Oh, started to going hunting. Shrimps.

2784
02:41:43,670 --> 02:41:46,820
I like the idea. You hosted a
show too. That's a great idea man.

2785
02:41:46,821 --> 02:41:49,370
That's what I'm in Boston.
That's what they used to do.

2786
02:41:49,371 --> 02:41:51,560
They used to have like
the Steve Sweeney show,

2787
02:41:51,561 --> 02:41:55,370
like the Boston headliners and that guy
would host and he would bring up all

2788
02:41:55,371 --> 02:41:56,210
these other comedians.

2789
02:41:56,700 --> 02:41:59,970
Fun. It's a way for me to kind
of stay, you know? Cause if you,

2790
02:41:59,971 --> 02:42:03,030
once you headline and
you just go on the road,

2791
02:42:03,031 --> 02:42:07,710
it's easy to kind of get out of
touch with who you know. So out.

2792
02:42:07,770 --> 02:42:12,020
It'd be comics that only been doing it
for a year on the same show with you know,

2793
02:42:12,160 --> 02:42:16,470
Chris rock or somebody. So it's good to
just see everybody and just, you know,

2794
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:19,790
and just, you know, I still like the, the,

2795
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:22,230
the structure of putting together a show,

2796
02:42:22,231 --> 02:42:25,830
just knowing I should have this person
on earlier and that a flow good and to

2797
02:42:25,831 --> 02:42:28,680
dance and this person should go
second half cause that. So I still,

2798
02:42:28,920 --> 02:42:32,280
I book it myself and everything.
So it's, it's, it's a lot of fun.

2799
02:42:32,281 --> 02:42:36,810
It's a good spot to just always,
always try new stuff there every week.

2800
02:42:36,811 --> 02:42:38,520
And it's a fun time.

2801
02:42:38,820 --> 02:42:42,780
Yeah, we do that out here at the Ice
House in Pasadena. If you ever around man,

2802
02:42:42,781 --> 02:42:44,610
we do a lot of like Wednesday night shows.

2803
02:42:44,611 --> 02:42:47,220
If you ever hear on a Wednesday
night and the same thing I'll,

2804
02:42:47,221 --> 02:42:50,170
it'll be me and I'll bring
along like Brian Cowan are,

2805
02:42:50,171 --> 02:42:53,490
you should fear Dunkin Joey deals look
good. Like all these different guys do it.

2806
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:57,730
And having that same sort of situation
where you're trying to figure out who

2807
02:42:57,900 --> 02:43:01,740
should go on after him and put
him here and it's fun. Yeah.

2808
02:43:02,270 --> 02:43:04,920
What, it works out the right way
and you're like, oh, that feels,

2809
02:43:04,950 --> 02:43:09,540
it just feels good. It kind of producing
something all the time and just,

2810
02:43:09,570 --> 02:43:13,210
you know, figuring out
what, Yay. Who we was like,

2811
02:43:13,690 --> 02:43:17,120
what comics was the audience we
were spying on what comics to,

2812
02:43:17,150 --> 02:43:19,060
obviously we're a sponsor of that
kind of thing. This is real cool.

2813
02:43:19,140 --> 02:43:20,400
Yeah.
Like what you're doing too though.

2814
02:43:20,401 --> 02:43:23,340
You're adding know the musical element
to it too. That's a great idea.

2815
02:43:23,650 --> 02:43:26,680
Yeah. The music album, it's just
good for energy and it's just,

2816
02:43:26,681 --> 02:43:29,260
it's just mixing it up and
makes it more of a old school.

2817
02:43:29,261 --> 02:43:32,980
So lately I've been having kind
of raw rappers and musicians open,

2818
02:43:33,070 --> 02:43:36,730
open for me on the road in addition to
having a comedian. I have one comedian.

2819
02:43:37,180 --> 02:43:41,520
Yeah. I mean doing Largo tonight. And
uh, this cat, he just got done to cat.

2820
02:43:41,530 --> 02:43:46,090
It was amazing. Uh, singer
and basis, he's performing.

2821
02:43:46,120 --> 02:43:48,270
And so it's just been real.
It's just a different vibe.

2822
02:43:48,271 --> 02:43:51,970
And this adds another element
to the show. Also. I just want,

2823
02:43:51,971 --> 02:43:54,070
I like giving people,
I get,

2824
02:43:54,160 --> 02:43:58,720
I get just cause my ticket prices just
started to go up, so I feel nervous.

2825
02:43:58,721 --> 02:44:01,390
So I want to give people as much
as a so as possible. So I'm like,

2826
02:44:01,391 --> 02:44:04,820
I got to have a musician,
I have a DJ with me. Like,

2827
02:44:04,840 --> 02:44:06,760
cause I do musical stuff doing my set.

2828
02:44:06,761 --> 02:44:10,360
When I talk about different rap
songs to DJ or cue it up. I got,

2829
02:44:10,390 --> 02:44:14,040
I do a song at the end,
ballerinas come out outside of that.

2830
02:44:14,190 --> 02:44:18,760
Do people pay 30 bucks? I'm
trying to do it up. So, uh, yeah,

2831
02:44:18,761 --> 02:44:21,320
I enjoyed it. Is trying
to, you know, you know,

2832
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:26,400
introduce people to introduce audiences
to new people and also just a freak out.

2833
02:44:26,771 --> 02:44:31,000
Just how to put on just a real a show
that people want to come back to it.

2834
02:44:31,001 --> 02:44:33,600
Like it's all about making
people want to talk about it.

2835
02:44:33,601 --> 02:44:36,430
And when I come back to this
city wanting to come again,

2836
02:44:36,580 --> 02:44:38,770
well you're doing it because I
keep hearing. Great. Thanks man.

2837
02:44:38,800 --> 02:44:41,320
I keep hearing great things.
Thanks man. And I've, uh,

2838
02:44:41,321 --> 02:44:45,490
I've only done one show everywhere.
I had music. There was a Joey Diaz,

2839
02:44:45,550 --> 02:44:49,420
me and Doug, Stan hope and
honey honey, this band that's a,

2840
02:44:49,750 --> 02:44:54,700
they're actually going to be here
tomorrow. Um, and we, uh, we all did this,

2841
02:44:54,701 --> 02:44:56,380
uh, show, uh,

2842
02:44:56,381 --> 02:44:59,920
at the Wiltern in La on December 21st,

2843
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:01,730
2012 because it was supposed to be
the end of the world. Yeah. Yeah.

2844
02:45:01,750 --> 02:45:05,160
That was when the mines, all the fucking
freaky people were thinking that. It was,

2845
02:45:06,100 --> 02:45:08,140
it was a awesome night.
It was an awesome night,

2846
02:45:08,141 --> 02:45:11,380
but it was the only time I've ever been
fired. Oh, it's fucking beautiful show.

2847
02:45:11,650 --> 02:45:16,620
I wore a suit and everything. I never
wear a suit. I wore slick clothes.

2848
02:45:16,720 --> 02:45:19,990
Felt odd, but I liked it, but
it felt good. Like, you know,

2849
02:45:20,110 --> 02:45:24,220
it was fun to do like a big show to
musical guests. I got to do more of those.

2850
02:45:24,500 --> 02:45:29,360
Yeah. It's just adds a acid, another
energy to it. Especially if the crowd is,

2851
02:45:29,390 --> 02:45:33,560
is that they go about doing it is just
making sure that the music economy could

2852
02:45:33,561 --> 02:45:37,310
work as long as people are a little bit,
it could work as a surprise,

2853
02:45:37,340 --> 02:45:39,710
but when people I built
it makes it better,

2854
02:45:39,770 --> 02:45:44,770
especially for the comedian opening for
a band and you walk out as a comedian

2855
02:45:44,961 --> 02:45:47,430
for a band and they don't
know that you're covered,

2856
02:45:47,490 --> 02:45:52,490
I guess is the word I years ago open
for this band unfree Mcgee's uh,

2857
02:45:52,700 --> 02:45:57,000
and we, it was, I took the
Gig was in Dekalb, Illinois.
It was about our outside,

2858
02:45:57,001 --> 02:45:59,900
Chicago's what? Northern Illinois
University is one of the band.

2859
02:45:59,901 --> 02:46:04,100
They saw me as xannies in Chicago Comedy
Club and they asked me to open for them

2860
02:46:04,760 --> 02:46:06,620
and so it was at,

2861
02:46:06,740 --> 02:46:11,740
I think they were on at nine and then at
45 they tell me to go and the lights go

2862
02:46:12,231 --> 02:46:17,210
down. And so there's been no
announcement that I'm going on.

2863
02:46:17,211 --> 02:46:19,460
It's just the lights went
down and then I walk out.

2864
02:46:21,280 --> 02:46:25,270
Crowd is like right away. Like
no, like they just started yelling

2865
02:46:27,410 --> 02:46:29,680
and it's not even the real showtime yet.

2866
02:46:29,681 --> 02:46:33,250
I'm up 15 minutes before
the actual start time.

2867
02:46:33,310 --> 02:46:37,210
I was the only open it but people were
just so agitated because they didn't want

2868
02:46:37,211 --> 02:46:39,130
to see a comedian.
They they you know,

2869
02:46:39,131 --> 02:46:43,150
bought these tickets probably months ago
and then some comedian they never heard

2870
02:46:43,151 --> 02:46:47,740
of is walking out so but it just
helps with just the audience.

2871
02:46:47,741 --> 02:46:50,440
So all of the [inaudible]
cause they didn't know either.

2872
02:46:50,441 --> 02:46:52,840
The band is just trying to put me
in a good spot. They were like,

2873
02:46:52,841 --> 02:46:53,561
we like this dude,

2874
02:46:53,561 --> 02:46:58,561
he used to be on the show and now I'm
known from doing shows that situation like

2875
02:46:58,991 --> 02:47:01,770
that all it takes is for
somebody from the bands,

2876
02:47:01,790 --> 02:47:04,330
either side stays on the mic
or even come out and say,

2877
02:47:04,331 --> 02:47:06,100
hey we are going to be
out in a little bit.

2878
02:47:06,101 --> 02:47:09,010
We got this commedia we like
check them out we think is funny.

2879
02:47:09,011 --> 02:47:12,550
And then that settles everything down
because now that gives me credibility.

2880
02:47:12,880 --> 02:47:14,470
So it's just about the audience,

2881
02:47:14,471 --> 02:47:17,670
knowing what's going on and then that
that makes everything work easier.

2882
02:47:17,710 --> 02:47:21,350
When I bring people on the road with me,
I always introduce them from the SAS.

2883
02:47:21,880 --> 02:47:24,140
I always say thank you
everybody for coming out. Yeah.

2884
02:47:24,260 --> 02:47:26,830
Yell out and just get everybody
hyped up and let them know. Like,

2885
02:47:26,860 --> 02:47:29,590
I'm sure I'm bringing this comedian
because I think he's hilarious.

2886
02:47:30,190 --> 02:47:31,410
I want you to see good shit.

2887
02:47:31,570 --> 02:47:33,970
Yeah. Some cats, the
people have open floor.

2888
02:47:34,050 --> 02:47:38,710
I've done that flow besides days
like Dimitri done that Aziz, uh,

2889
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:43,740
Louis, it just helps subside
GAF. Like it just helps it, uh,

2890
02:47:44,200 --> 02:47:45,370
especially as,
I mean,

2891
02:47:45,371 --> 02:47:48,460
your crowds might be a little bit
more aggressive to some mothers. No,

2892
02:47:48,520 --> 02:47:52,890
they're nice. They're nice, but you don't
show sometime man. It'll still show some,

2893
02:47:52,930 --> 02:47:55,330
let's do a show. That's awesome, man.

2894
02:47:55,530 --> 02:47:59,160
Yeah. Um, I opened up
for Bon Jovi once. Yeah.

2895
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:04,350
I was in a theater in the round in,
I think it was in queens and it was,

2896
02:48:04,351 --> 02:48:08,070
I'm a long time ago. Yeah, it was two.
It was ridiculous. I was, first of all,

2897
02:48:08,071 --> 02:48:08,910
I wasn't that good.

2898
02:48:09,160 --> 02:48:13,110
I had only been doing comedy for
like four years and a second.

2899
02:48:13,560 --> 02:48:17,070
Second of all, it was they didn't
want to see a comedian, you know,

2900
02:48:17,130 --> 02:48:19,770
it just was a terrible idea.
The whole idea was awful.

2901
02:48:20,280 --> 02:48:24,720
And I'm standing on this fucking stage
surrounded by like a drum set and guitar.

2902
02:48:24,721 --> 02:48:27,900
I can't move. I didn't know
where to stand. It was a,

2903
02:48:28,920 --> 02:48:31,670
Oh was the,
was the uh,

2904
02:48:32,720 --> 02:48:36,800
what are the people like the rodeo 80
by was there moving around fixing shit

2905
02:48:36,801 --> 02:48:40,150
behind you.
100% subsides and music gets with it.

2906
02:48:40,400 --> 02:48:43,310
Comedians out data respect that
it's still fixing the sound.

2907
02:48:43,311 --> 02:48:47,390
They might even bang on the drums a
little bit. Check the guitar, no doubt.

2908
02:48:47,990 --> 02:48:52,100
Check things, check the
drums, don't give a fuck.

2909
02:48:52,610 --> 02:48:54,350
They don't care about you.
They just like I'm done.

2910
02:48:54,351 --> 02:48:58,080
I'm trying to do my job the best way
possible. It's fuck you and your up.

2911
02:48:58,290 --> 02:48:59,580
Yeah.
It was just bizarre man.

2912
02:48:59,581 --> 02:49:03,990
It was just bizarre being on a stage
when nobody wants you to be doing comedy.

2913
02:49:04,020 --> 02:49:06,810
Like they want you to go out there and
do comedy for people who didn't want to

2914
02:49:06,930 --> 02:49:07,741
come see comedy.

2915
02:49:07,741 --> 02:49:11,760
There's a totally different mindset
going to see Bon Jovi and some unknown

2916
02:49:11,761 --> 02:49:15,360
shithead tell bad jokes.
Yeah. Waiting for Bon Jovi.

2917
02:49:15,390 --> 02:49:17,940
They also wanted me to
like work the crowd.

2918
02:49:17,941 --> 02:49:21,090
Like they wanted me to bring
women up towards the front.

2919
02:49:21,690 --> 02:49:26,190
They wanted me to grab the most attractive
women and ask them to come towards

2920
02:49:26,191 --> 02:49:26,551
the front.

2921
02:49:26,551 --> 02:49:29,970
They wanted to like sort of engineer
the front in the middle of your bombing.

2922
02:49:30,120 --> 02:49:33,920
Exactly.
The middle of me eating Dick and,

2923
02:49:33,930 --> 02:49:36,420
and there wasn't that many
attractive women in the first place.

2924
02:49:36,421 --> 02:49:38,880
It was like picking the ones
who were attractive was,

2925
02:49:38,890 --> 02:49:43,080
it wasn't the best job.
So were you able to do that at all?

2926
02:49:43,170 --> 02:49:47,250
I did something. I mean it was a long time
ago. It was a disaster, whatever it was.

2927
02:49:47,820 --> 02:49:49,590
I remember getting out of there going,
okay,

2928
02:49:50,190 --> 02:49:53,010
now I know what it's like to
open up for our band. Fuck that.

2929
02:49:53,370 --> 02:49:57,930
And that was a nice crowd as far as
like bands go, that's a nice crowd.

2930
02:49:58,160 --> 02:50:00,930
I just was terrible.
I shouldn't have been doing it.

2931
02:50:01,320 --> 02:50:04,380
I've had gigs with, there's isn't
that, I've done gigs recently.

2932
02:50:04,381 --> 02:50:08,040
Over the past year would have
been horrible gigs with music,

2933
02:50:08,220 --> 02:50:12,540
but I just bailed early. Like if I could
feel it in the first couple of jokes,

2934
02:50:13,180 --> 02:50:16,080
like, all right, this is the
fun. Y'all have a good one.

2935
02:50:17,940 --> 02:50:21,340
I we you still doing it?

2936
02:50:21,350 --> 02:50:23,550
Like somebody called you up today
and asked you to open up for a band.

2937
02:50:23,551 --> 02:50:27,690
Would you still do it? It depends
on the band. If I'm, I won't do it.

2938
02:50:28,170 --> 02:50:30,480
It had to be a favor and just something,

2939
02:50:30,570 --> 02:50:34,060
if it was a charity thing or if
the money's right, like I, I,

2940
02:50:34,300 --> 02:50:37,860
I'm not just going to turn down a
gig because of it being for a band.

2941
02:50:37,861 --> 02:50:40,770
It has to be, yeah. I have
to ask some questions.

2942
02:50:40,970 --> 02:50:43,580
Well, it's getting also as a point
where people know who you are too,

2943
02:50:43,581 --> 02:50:47,000
so they come see you and the band
they expect you and the band.

2944
02:50:47,001 --> 02:50:50,120
That's part of the hope program.
That makes a lot more sense then.

2945
02:50:50,310 --> 02:50:54,210
Yeah, just me kind of flounder and in
front of it. But I think it's, and it's,

2946
02:50:54,270 --> 02:50:58,470
it's been two or three gigs where I just
said, you know what, I'm Outta here.

2947
02:50:58,471 --> 02:51:02,680
Y'All caught me. Like my name was
Hannibal Burress see how later.

2948
02:51:02,690 --> 02:51:06,750
Like I would even good because this
is like, you know what the Gig wasn't.

2949
02:51:06,810 --> 02:51:10,830
It wasn't right, but I don't, I know it.
There's no bearing on what I could do.

2950
02:51:10,831 --> 02:51:13,950
It just wasn't the right situation. Did
you ever see the one with Charlie Murphy,

2951
02:51:13,951 --> 02:51:17,760
uh, toward the checkup? He didn't really
say that checkout well, he didn't.

2952
02:51:17,850 --> 02:51:21,000
He didn't. I don't think
he, I do know for sure.

2953
02:51:21,810 --> 02:51:24,420
I think I remember look at it up more.

2954
02:51:24,450 --> 02:51:29,110
I think he kept that check and I
was a show. I don't know. I know,

2955
02:51:29,111 --> 02:51:33,120
I know Charlie, he's kind of crazy.
He to definitely tear up a chalk,

2956
02:51:33,130 --> 02:51:36,180
especially if you had money and he's got
money to tear up a chart and tell you,

2957
02:51:36,181 --> 02:51:40,690
go fuck yourself. It's got a
lot of character. Well, Scott,

2958
02:51:40,770 --> 02:51:41,603
balls of steel.

2959
02:51:41,940 --> 02:51:46,380
I'm the type of dude I tear up a check
and then have my agent asked, but a wire

2960
02:51:48,930 --> 02:51:53,820
on second thought, can you sit in that
to this routing number, please? Yeah.

2961
02:51:53,821 --> 02:51:57,360
That's probably the more intelligent
way of doing it. It's fake.

2962
02:51:57,380 --> 02:52:00,840
Just tear up a piece of paper fucking
checks. Why? Think about your money.

2963
02:52:03,770 --> 02:52:05,950
Yeah,
a symbolic check.

2964
02:52:06,140 --> 02:52:09,010
Yeah. Hannibal, you're funny, mother
fucker. Thank you very much for having me.

2965
02:52:09,011 --> 02:52:12,760
This was, this was real cool. I
enjoyed it very much, man. Okay.
