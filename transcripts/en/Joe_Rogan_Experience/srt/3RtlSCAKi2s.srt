1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,511
And she'll,

2
00:00:00,511 --> 00:00:02,010
for an entirely nother universe.

3
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,990
I read this really cool
book by physicists.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,591
We talked about that,

5
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:07,620
that actually there might be entry
point to different universe where the

6
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:11,200
cosmological constants are slightly
different and just like genetic mutations,

7
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,660
which are different in every organism,

8
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,080
the Dm such that instead of having a
big bang you would have actually had an

9
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:19,740
infinite number of universes constantly
kind of creating and developing through

10
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:22,230
these different black hole portals
makes actually more sense to me.

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:22,801
Well,

12
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:23,280
you know,

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,220
one of the things that I've always felt
like when I have like really intense

14
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:27,270
psychedelic experiences,

15
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:27,860
like would it,

16
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,740
the thought that,

17
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:31,980
I mean a million people have is what if
this is not actually an hallucination,

18
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:35,190
but in fact some sort of a chemical
doorway into some other state.

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,040
There's something else out there and
we're just so used to the idea that like

20
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,430
this chair sits on the ground and this
table sits here and a laptop sits in a

21
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:44,490
chair and this is all normal,

22
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,050
but we could easily be
from that DMT dimension.

23
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,100
That would be our normal everyday reality.

24
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,220
And they would come here and we would
think this is the craziest fucking

25
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:54,660
psychedelic experience ever.

26
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,810
Drinking red liquid from thin glasses
and talking into electrical impulses that

27
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,800
send them through wires.

28
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:06,210
And hundreds of thousands of people
listen and they ride out of mass

29
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:09,720
transportation on fucking elliptical
machines all over the world.

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,380
That is psychedelic,

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,080
that's psychedelic as fuck.

32
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,350
Well,

33
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,591
I mean,

34
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:13,830
that's,

35
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,720
if you lived in a
dimension of pure love and,

36
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,150
and,

37
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:17,371
and,

38
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:17,641
you know,

39
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:17,851
and,

40
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:18,070
and,

41
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,890
and eternal consciousness,

42
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:21,090
all interconnected.

43
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,770
And you know,

44
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:22,141
there was,

45
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:23,490
there was no physical matter.

46
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:25,200
You would just live in the DMT realm.

47
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,140
This world would be a completely.
