1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,730
Three two,
one.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Boom.
Michael Scharmer's here,

3
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:05,334
ladies and gentlemen again,
and we've been talking about silly 

4
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:09,910
people for the past 15 minutes.
We just,

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,973
we had to get warmed up,
fill the list is endless to get warmed 

6
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:13,944
up with body doubles.
It's fair as Hillary Hillary had her 

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,090
about yet flat.
Earthers um,

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,430
forests aren't real.
Is that what they're saying?

9
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:21,264
Jamie?
The flat earthers we're going to talk 

10
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:25,000
about the flat earthers for one reason.
Um,

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,953
the reason why I wanted to bring this up
is because I think there's a lot of 

12
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:32,940
folks out there that are super gullible 
and I think they're being trolled.

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,690
I think they're being trolled by people 
who put together these,

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,573
it's one of two options.
Either they're being trolled by people 

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,213
who put together these elaborate 
arguments for something that they don't 

16
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:47,070
believe because they're just trying to 
make money off of youtube videos,

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,540
which is entirely possible.

18
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,763
And this needs to be thought of.
I mean really needs to be considered 

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,703
because lou youtube videos can be 
extremely lucrative if you can get a 

20
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:56,844
youtube video with millions of hits and 
a lot of these videos on all sorts of 

21
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:03,810
different conspiracies and all sorts of 
different crazy things can generate that

22
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:05,910
kind of volume.
You're making real money,

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,820
pennies on the dollar,
but if it's millions,

24
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:08,610
yes,
yep.

25
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,443
It starts becoming real money.
It starts and if you do a bunch of them 

26
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:12,870
and you can,
you do them on a regular basis,

27
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:15,210
it becomes a Gig.
It becomes like what they do.

28
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,123
They create these silly videos,
but people who just don't have the time 

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,473
or the inclination to actually read 
scientific papers and articles and 

30
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:26,964
journals and all these different things 
that explain how we've known for a long 

31
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,080
time that the earth is right,

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,820
right.
Yeah.

33
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:38,580
It's a myth that a Columbus proved that 
the earth is not flat,

34
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:39,920
that it's round.
They,

35
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,600
the ancients knew,
the Greeks knew,

36
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,434
Columbus knew.
Everyone knew a little bit then that it 

37
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:49,931
was round and there's absolutely 
depictions on clay.

38
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,280
Right.
Drew it in clay.

39
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:54,640
They drew all the planets as circles,
right?

40
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,940
They knew,
right.

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,670
I mean there's some obvious simple ones 
anybody could do.

42
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:01,250
If you see an eclipse,
like a lunar eclipse,

43
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,500
you can see the Earth's shadow on the 
moon.

44
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:05,420
It's round.
Uh,

45
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,380
you know,
if you,

46
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,230
if you're high enough and you know,
the ships are sailing out,

47
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:10,064
you can see the mass does.
The last thing you would see as the 

48
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:14,570
whole drops over the horizon first,
slowly.

49
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,913
You know,
there's things like that that we know 

50
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,350
the earth is round.
You know,

51
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,050
you traveled around,
you come back to where you started.

52
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,530
Um,
you know,

53
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,740
now their explanation,
the flat earthers is that,

54
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:26,270
yeah,
it's round like a pizza,

55
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,860
but around flat pizza and all the 
continents are on the one flat face side

56
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,250
up and that the satellites are up there 
going around.

57
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:34,881
It's like,
yeah,

58
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:35,714
but the satellite photos don't show all 
the continents in one picture because 

59
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,420
some of them are on the other side of 
the globe.

60
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:42,620
So that refutes that.

61
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,940
Well,
not only that,

62
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:47,750
but they think that satellites are 
actually in planes.

63
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,020
They're in planes and Ortho over that 
are just circling around.

64
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,480
There's no actual satellites.
They don't even believe in satellite.

65
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:53,480
The

66
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,291
lights.
Yeah.

67
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,900
So back to your original comment,
I,

68
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,430
some of these recent ones are so that 
you can't help but think,

69
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,443
okay.
They don't believe that they're just 

70
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,290
yanking our chain for maybe financial 
reasons.

71
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,510
But that does get to the question I 
always get,

72
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,190
which is do these people really believe 
it?

73
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:10,024
The cult leaders,
the people that make a extraordinary 

74
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:14,140
claims,
are they just making this stuff up?

75
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,640
You know,
people make shit up all the time.

76
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,890
It's called fiction fantasy.
Uh,

77
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,450
or do they really believe it or they,
you know,

78
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:21,430
true believers and you know,
it's hard to tell.

79
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:23,800
It's hard to get inside people's heads.
Uh,

80
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,990
the old flat earthers in the 19th 
century,

81
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,030
I think they really did believe it.
Uh,

82
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,830
there wasn't much money to be made,
you know,

83
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,693
on those kinds of things.
I mentioned the Alfred Russell Wallace 

84
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:35,680
who was the co discover of natural 
selection with Darwin.

85
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,903
I wrote my dissertation on him.
And wrote a biography of him and he was 

86
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:39,814
quite the colorful character who was so 
open minded to new ideas that he was 

87
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:43,894
also gullible.
So open minded enough to see this 

88
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:50,200
radical new theory of the evolution of 
life by natural selection that's good.

89
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,190
Pioneered other fields like biogeography
and so on.

90
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,150
But he also was really into spiritualism
and phrenology,

91
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,450
seances handling all that stuff.
And then he encountered an ad and one of

92
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:09,640
the natural history magazines for this 
500 pound bet,

93
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:11,440
if anybody could prove the earth is 
round.

94
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,610
So he devised a test and he went down to
the Bedford canal,

95
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:16,810
which is a long,
straight,

96
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:18,610
like 10,
10 kilometers long.

97
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:19,444
You can see the whole distance and if 
you put these little sticks in the 

98
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,780
ground with markers on them and you get 
a little telescope like,

99
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:26,614
uh,
um,

100
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,410
uh,
surveyors scope and you line it up,

101
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:30,970
you can see that it bends.

102
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,640
So at each point that stick is,
you know,

103
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,710
three meters above the ground at each 
point.

104
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,903
And uh,
but you can see that it's dropped down 

105
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:39,520
in the last one,
so it's bent.

106
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,310
So he won the bet,
but he didn't get paid,

107
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:43,930
of course,
because these people are cranks.

108
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:44,681
And,
uh,

109
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:48,220
so we had to take him to court.
It's ended up costing him about 15 years

110
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,270
of his career,
you know,

111
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:50,590
just wasting time,
you know,

112
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,560
writing letters and getting court dates 
and suing this guy and,

113
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,570
you know,
whatever the try to win the bet.

114
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,560
Yeah.
Just try to win the bet.

115
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:58,030
So,
and of course,

116
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,430
what happens,
you get caught up emotionally,

117
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:01,264
like,
I'm not going to let this bastard get 

118
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:03,120
away with this.
You know,

119
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,840
you should have just cut his losses and 
laugh.

120
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:05,674
But anyway,
and I found these letters that this guy 

121
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,880
wrote to the national degree or the,
uh,

122
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:12,880
the Royal Geographical Society about,
uh,

123
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,410
Alfred Russell Wallace.
You know,

124
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:17,800
you have one member of your society that
should be,

125
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:19,420
you know,
he's a quack and a crank and,

126
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:21,810
you know,
and he wrote letters to the Wallace,

127
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:22,900
his wife,
you know,

128
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:23,734
you better not sleep in your bed at 
night quietly because I'm coming to get 

129
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:27,360
you guys.
And it's like,

130
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,611
oh,
look,

131
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:28,450
like death threats.
Yeah.

132
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,650
So,
uh,

133
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,071
it,
you know,

134
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:30,904
you're,
it's always questionable to deal with 

135
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:34,300
cranks because some of them are a 
little,

136
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,130
uh,
mentally deranged.

137
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,313
Sure.
And they can attach themselves to 

138
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,490
someone like Wallace or Darwin or 
anybody else.

139
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,343
If,
if you can somehow or another connect 

140
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:45,960
yourself to them and some sort of an 
argument,

141
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,823
it's kind of legitimizes you at least in
a way because that person's giving you 

142
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:50,514
attention,
that person is engaging you and it 

143
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:53,064
elevates your standing.
And then whenever two people are 

144
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:55,524
arguing,
a certain amount of people are going to 

145
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,040
choose sides.

146
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,263
They're just getting,
even if what you're saying doesn't make 

147
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:02,054
any sense,
there's going to be a gang of people 

148
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:03,621
that go,
I like,

149
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:04,454
what are you saying?
And they're going to join in and people 

150
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:09,050
love,
they love to be on a team.

151
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,093
They love to be,
they want to be on team Wallace or team 

152
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:12,440
crank.
Right.

153
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,200
That's a natural.
And that's also why people like a lot of

154
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:17,230
the creation is Wanda debate dawkins.
Yes.

155
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,163
Because he's the guy,
he's the number one top best known 

156
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,100
biological scientists in the world,
possibly for since Darwin himself.

157
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,010
If I can get him onstage and it's 
Dawkins likes to say,

158
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,110
this will look better on your resume 
than mine,

159
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:32,360
so I'll pass and he doesn't need the 
money.

160
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:34,860
So well in the contrary argument or the,
uh,

161
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:35,694
the other position is so many people who
are actual scientists want to debate 

162
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,390
depok oh well yes.

163
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,223
And I have debated the puck and now,
so here's back to the question is does 

164
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,210
he really believe it?
Cause people,

165
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,290
most skeptics and atheists thing,
well,

166
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,450
pucks just a fraud,
a con man selling snake oil.

167
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,090
I don't think so.
I've known him now for a number of years

168
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:58,220
and the last year I've spent a lot of 
time with them.

169
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,773
And the reason I know he believes it,
absolutely what he says is because he's 

170
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:04,510
always working on me.
Um,

171
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,521
privately,
you know,

172
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:07,360
if we're at lunch or dinner or,
I mean,

173
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,700
I got half a dozen emails just the last 
two days from dupont.

174
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,103
And you know,
it's not for public consumption is not 

175
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:14,510
trying to,
we're not debating,

176
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,970
he's just trying to convince me,
uh,

177
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:17,840
you know,
that he's right.

178
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:19,130
Like,
what does he try and convince you?

179
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,350
Well,
a about consciousness here.

180
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,120
Uh,
can you do it in his voice please?

181
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,570
A quote from Vince Donta,
all of the body is in the mind,

182
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,960
but not all of the mind is in the body.
A Swami Rama.

183
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,810
Well as long as he's quoting Swami Rama 
and we know.

184
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,483
So,
uh,

185
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,640
so he sends me these not because he's,
he's a crank.

186
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,011
He,
he,

187
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:47,090
he wants to convince me that his 
worldview is,

188
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,403
um,
different from mine but better or I 

189
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:52,340
should have a more open mind.
Well,

190
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,174
that's a bizarre quote and that quote 
can be interpreted a bunch of different 

191
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:57,560
ways and um,
you know,

192
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,170
one could say that we really don't know 
where consciousness is.

193
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:02,150
We,
well we need that exists in the mind.

194
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,900
But you know,
what we do know is if you blow someone's

195
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:09,050
brains out,
they no longer exhibit any behavior that

196
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:11,600
you could recognize as being conscious.
Right?

197
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,740
So,
um,

198
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,070
in my debates with the Puck,
I make the point,

199
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,840
I mean,
he points out as you just did,

200
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,640
consciousness is the so called heart 
problem and not how neurons fire.

201
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,473
We know how that works,
but the experience you have of looking 

202
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:26,384
at me and vice versa,
how does that derive from just a 

203
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:34,190
dopamine going across synapses or 
norepinephrine going across synapses?

204
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:35,024
It's just electric meat.
How do you get electric meet to have 

205
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:39,740
this experience where happy as he likes 
to say,

206
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:41,450
where's the red?
If I open your skull up,

207
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:43,580
there's no red in there,
there's no room in there.

208
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:46,520
It's just neurons firing.
So how does that happen?

209
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:48,320
Okay,
so this is the hard problem.

210
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,740
No one knows,
you know,

211
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,410
but,
but it's not that we don't nothing,

212
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,313
you know,
we have some ideas about how it works 

213
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,380
and I think this is just one of those 
ones that either will never be resolved,

214
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:59,730
like free will,
determinism,

215
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,421
you know,
okay,

216
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:01,254
we live in a determined universe.
How can we have free will if that's 

217
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:03,810
true.

218
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,531
Okay.
The words,

219
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:06,210
the language that,
you know,

220
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:07,044
there's certain restrictions on our 
cognition of how we think about the 

221
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:12,510
world and that's very much influenced by
the words we use.

222
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,610
So that could be one of those mysterion 
mysteries that you know,

223
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,440
can't be solved simply by the,
not that we're not smart enough,

224
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,830
that just the limitations of how we 
perceive the world.

225
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,720
Uh,
and it's just,

226
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,890
uh,
you know,

227
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:29,490
so there,
I like to look at like this,

228
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,550
there was a big survey of professional 
philosophers done about three years ago,

229
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:36,600
about 2,600
phd,

230
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:40,140
either professors or,
or doctoral students in philosophy.

231
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:43,740
What is your position on,
and they're like 25 different debates in

232
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:45,420
philosophy and like free will.
Determinism,

233
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:46,254
it was roughly equally split between 
determinist and compatible is like Dan 

234
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,263
Dennett is a compatiblist.
Sam Harris is a determinist and a small 

235
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:56,010
percentage of a libertarian free will.

236
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,440
What are the compatiblist compatiblist 
uh,

237
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,530
uh,
except the,

238
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,443
the premise that the universe is 
determined governed by laws of nature 

239
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:04,830
and so on,
but that,

240
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,723
um,
we make free choices within the causal 

241
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,030
net of the universe.
That is,

242
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,910
I'm making choices like I chose to come 
out here.

243
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,010
Uh,
and that was a choice.

244
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,641
Uh,
yes,

245
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:18,090
the universe is determined,
but my behavior,

246
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:22,140
my actions might volitional choices 
within the net.

247
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,650
The causal net is part of it.
Uh,

248
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:26,484
and in any case,
you can't know all the variables so it 

249
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:29,154
feels like you're making free choices.
So you are in essence making free 

250
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:36,660
choices because it feels free even if 
cause you don't know all the determining

251
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:37,494
factors.
So the compatiblist is something like 

252
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:40,410
that.
There's just different versions of it.

253
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:40,980
Dan,
Dan,

254
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,341
Dan,
Dan,

255
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,710
it makes a good argument.
Degrees of freedom.

256
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,410
We have this idea of degrees of freedom 
and engineering.

257
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,483
Certain systems are more complex or less
complex in certain systems have more 

258
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:54,210
variation than others.
So if you think of degrees of freedom,

259
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:56,370
like an insect has very few degrees of 
freedom,

260
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:58,650
it's almost entirely instinctively 
driven.

261
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,710
Small number of neurons and so on.
Uh,

262
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,573
maybe a rat has more degrees of freedom 
than an insect that dog more than a rat 

263
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,790
primate more than a dog.
US more than the other primates.

264
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,550
It just how many choices,
how many variations.

265
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:13,170
So you can come up here,
you go this way,

266
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:13,801
this way,
this way,

267
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:15,420
this way,
this way with the human,

268
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:17,400
it's not clear which way they're going 
to go with the Rad.

269
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:19,050
It's more predictable.
They'll take this,

270
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,393
uh,
this maze or that maze because the food 

271
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:23,730
is over there.
Something like that.

272
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,170
So as dented argues that we're free 
year,

273
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,260
then,
you know,

274
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:31,650
the,
the mouse or the dog,

275
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:32,760
we have more choices.

276
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,810
And even within human populations,
the law has already accommodated this.

277
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:37,950
So,
you know,

278
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,380
first degree murder is different than 
second degree murder.

279
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,233
Oh,
you know,

280
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,083
w w what is the difference?
To what extent you intended to kill the 

281
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:49,260
person you planned it out versus you are
out of control.

282
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,910
You know,
you inflict grotto,

283
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,340
you Katra partner in bed with somebody 
else,

284
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,870
you lost your temper ban.
Oh,

285
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:57,550
okay.
But you wouldn't normally do that.

286
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,510
So we think,
well,

287
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,680
violent aggressiveness or drug 
addiction,

288
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,090
alcohol addiction,
the tumor on the brain.

289
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,111
Uh,
you know,

290
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:05,944
the famous case of a,
the University of Texas Bell Tower 

291
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,600
shooter,
uh,

292
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:11,201
Whitman,
you know,

293
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:13,360
you left that note.
Uh,

294
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,243
you know,
lately I've been feeling not normal and 

295
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,344
you know,
I'm feeling quite violent and I'm going 

296
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:24,130
to do some bad shit today.
So when I'm dead do an autopsy.

297
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:24,964
So he went out and killed his mother and
then he went to the bell tower and 

298
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:28,510
killed 19 people or whatever it was.

299
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,120
They did an autopsy shirt off.
He's got a tumor.

300
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,450
I think it was next to the hypothalamus.
So we would,

301
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,373
we would recognize,
look at that guy had fewer degrees of 

302
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:38,840
freedom than you and I do.
Uh,

303
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,480
it's not that we,
excuse it,

304
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:41,590
we just say,
okay,

305
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:43,420
he had a tumor,
you know,

306
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:44,254
so that's the compatiblist argument.
I'll sand someone like Samara 

307
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,600
determinist would say it's,
it's all,

308
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:50,620
it's all tumors,
you know,

309
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:51,454
it's all determined.
You're just using different causal 

310
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:54,394
vectors to describe the behavior.
Some of them are more obvious than 

311
00:12:57,221 --> 00:13:01,120
others.
So the best argument on that case I know

312
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:05,860
of is from a guy named Adrian Raine,
who's a psychiatrist and neuroscientists

313
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,330
who was the first to scan the brains of 
a serial killers in prison.

314
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,870
So he would take this portable fm Ri 
brain scanner to these prisons and these

315
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:16,840
guys have nothing to do.

316
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,970
So they're happy to participate as 
subjects.

317
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,283
And he would scan their brains and he 
found that they have very little self 

318
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,653
control,
which is associated with the prefrontal 

319
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:29,860
cortex and their prefrontal cortex is 
we're pretty quiet,

320
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:32,560
pretty undeveloped,
inactive.

321
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,550
So you have all these impulses that 
bubble up and there's no break.

322
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,460
There's no governor on the system to 
keep it in check.

323
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:40,294
Whereas you and I would count to 10 or 
walk out of the room if we're getting 

324
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:43,620
heated up,
uh,

325
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,820
their lucky more likely to just reach 
out,

326
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,410
punch you if you say something,
you know,

327
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,270
like something like that lack of self 
control.

328
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,730
So he argues that,
um,

329
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,110
that if somebody has a tumor,
it's obvious you can see it.

330
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,440
But what if somebody just has the 
crappiest background?

331
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,520
You can imagine,
you know,

332
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:02,590
raised in a broken home,
single mom,

333
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,980
drug addictions,
gang related inner city,

334
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,770
crappy diets dropped on their head and 
so on.

335
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,150
And he gives an example of this,
a young man named Donta page and African

336
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,983
American who was convicted for raping 
and killing a woman and he's on death 

337
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:20,710
row or I think he got life in prison in 
a case.

338
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,240
Um,
you know,

339
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:24,430
so he describes spends pages in this 
book,

340
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:27,340
the anatomy of violence,
of this guy's background.

341
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:28,174
And it's the worst background you,
you could possibly imagine that surely 

342
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:31,774
has affects on his brain.
So there's not a tumor you can't scan 

343
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:35,561
and go,
look,

344
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:36,490
there's a tumor,
okay,

345
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,473
he's got a tumor,
but he's had a background that would 

346
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:42,430
surely be different than the background 
you and I have had.

347
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,540
And therefore he had fewer choices in 
his actions that you and I would have.

348
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,770
And so,
you know,

349
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:49,420
the law would deal with that 
differently.

350
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,470
And,
but see,

351
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:52,040
someone like Dan Dennett would say,

352
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,873
well that those are degrees of freedom.
He had fewer choices than the person 

353
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:59,720
that didn't have the awful background.
So that's one of these,

354
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,870
this is one of those things where it 
depends what you mean by these words,

355
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,910
like decrees of freedom,
volition,

356
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:09,110
choice actions versus just more of a 
physics,

357
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:12,710
engineering billiard table type of 
causal model.

358
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,913
Well,
it's a really complex question and 

359
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:17,264
subject and one that people battle with.
Even when you're faced with the 

360
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,700
determinism argument like you,
you,

361
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,553
if you take in the logic of determinism,
like you are the product of your 

362
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,060
genetics,
of your environment,

363
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:29,894
of all your life experiences have all 
these different things and they are 

364
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:35,390
what's dictating all your choices.
So even when you're making a choice,

365
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,493
the choice you're making is based on all
the data that you've taken in your 

366
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:39,794
entire life.
So do you in fact have freewill at that 

367
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:46,820
moment or has it all been sort of 
determined by all these experiences?

368
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,710
And it's so hard to argue because 
everybody's life is different.

369
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:53,840
Everybody's take on things are 
different.

370
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:57,420
Everybody's experience.
You could have the exact same experience

371
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:58,254
as I do,
but your take from it might be very 

372
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:03,140
different than mine.
You might be a person meditates.

373
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,990
So you might be really into mindfulness 
and really into uh,

374
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,873
sitting down and trying to objectively 
analyze all your thoughts and your 

375
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:12,044
reactions.
You might come out with a completely 

376
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:13,964
different decision based on that.
So is it still determinism if all of a 

377
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:20,450
sudden you start practicing meditation 
and you change your behavior?

378
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,580
Is that determinism?
There is that I would love,

379
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,610
I would love that more into the category
of freedom.

380
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,330
You,
you,

381
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,163
you may become self aware.
Like I have a violent temper and I 

382
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:32,210
really need to do something about this.
Well,

383
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:33,050
what can I do?
Well,

384
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:34,080
meditation,
right?

385
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,940
Uh,
okay,

386
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:37,970
so then I choose to start meditating.
Just like the attic.

387
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,700
I mean,
we talk about addicts having been out of

388
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:43,010
control,
but lots of addicts actually stop.

389
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,040
They break the addiction they have,
how do they do it?

390
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,240
Well,
meditation,

391
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:47,990
they used,
you know,

392
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,380
behave cognitive behavior therapy.
They go to these clinics and so on,

393
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,390
but they've got to drive themselves 
there.

394
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:56,270
They got to actively do it.
They're aware that they're doing that.

395
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,750
I would lump that into the,
you're making kind of a free choice.

396
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:00,584
You don't have to do that.
You could just keep doing your 

397
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:05,600
addiction.
But if I was a determinism proponent,

398
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,950
I would say,
well no,

399
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:07,784
because your decision to make that 
choice is based on all of your 

400
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:12,140
experiences,
your genetics,

401
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:13,550
your,
your family,

402
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:14,384
your background,
all of your input that you've gotten 

403
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:17,564
from other people about your behavior.
And you've decided to make a choice 

404
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:23,030
based on that data.
Correct.

405
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:23,570
That,
that,

406
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,550
that would be the counter give very 
daunting.

407
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,530
But yes.
So it's like that.

408
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:29,060
I think also with consciousness,
you know,

409
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:31,490
what do you mean by consciousness?
And you know,

410
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,230
it's a hard problem.
Okay,

411
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:35,690
but,
but is it ever resolvable?

412
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:40,490
So Depok thinks it's not just through a 
neuroscience explanation,

413
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,540
bottom up molecules scaling up,
emergent property,

414
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:48,050
mind out of brain.
That's what most of us scientists think.

415
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:50,100
People like Christof Koch Works on this 
problem.

416
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,540
You know,
he's scaling up,

417
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,374
he's just looking at the visual cortex 
in the back of the brain and looking at 

418
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,550
visual conscious experiences.
Now let's see if we can figure that out.

419
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,460
So I liked that approach.
But someone like Deepak says,

420
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,400
it'll never get us there.
That that he,

421
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:09,630
so he used language like the 
consciousness is the ground of being.

422
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,250
Now I know that phrase from Paul Tillich
who said God is the ground of being,

423
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:15,290
what does this mean?
It's,

424
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,700
it's like,
it's not quite to say that consciousness

425
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:19,470
is everywhere.
It's in here,

426
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:21,960
it's in the clock.
It's in this table because that would be

427
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:24,990
more of a sort of a deism or pantheism 
or something like that.

428
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,383
It's,
it's more like it's just a part of the 

429
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:30,690
universe.
I'm not sure.

430
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:34,350
I really understand cause you know 
deepak has a different language,

431
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,193
has that sort of that eastern wisdom 
traditions like romy and so on and very 

432
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:38,940
kind.

433
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,773
I will call it word salad.
Well there's a lot of word salad going 

434
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:44,160
on.
Sounds like that to westerners.

435
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:46,590
I've tried to put myself into his 
worldview.

436
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,483
So for example,
a few months ago my wife and I went and 

437
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:50,364
spent three days at the Chopra Center 
that the La Costa resort and spa in 

438
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:54,720
Carlsbad,
California.

439
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,580
Okay.
This is a great weekend.

440
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:58,380
And we did the full immersion,
the t,

441
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:00,090
the Diet,
the yoga,

442
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,620
meditation,
the whole thing.

443
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,340
And I did feel much better afterwards.
But of course,

444
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,300
you can't go to the Lacosta spa and 
resort in Carlsbad,

445
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:11,580
California at the beach and not feel 
good.

446
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:13,050
I mean,
if you don't feel good after that,

447
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,270
you're the problem,
not the system.

448
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,580
It's also the things you're saying.
You're drinking tea,

449
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:19,730
which is great for you doing yoga,
which is great for you.

450
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:20,564
You're relaxing and that you're also 
going there with the intent to try to 

451
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:26,310
make some positive change in your life 
and try to get on a good path.

452
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,690
That's right.
And all those things that good,

453
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,700
all those things are good.
Now,

454
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,613
um,
Deepak just released a paper that was 

455
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,320
published this week.
He wasn't one of the authors,

456
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:39,321
but it was on the effects of,
of his program on biomarkers and various

457
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,583
physiological changes.
So this was conducted by a Harvard 

458
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:48,471
medical scientist named Rudy Tanzi.
Rudy is the scientist who discovered the

459
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:49,314
genes for Alzheimer's.
So he does a lot of work with Alzheimer 

460
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:54,060
patients.
Uh,

461
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:54,894
you know,
to what extent do we have any meds to 

462
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:57,180
treat it?
Not really.

463
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,660
Um,
what about meditation?

464
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:02,700
What about diet?
These kinds of things.

465
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,813
You know,
there's,

466
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,720
it's not terribly hopeful,
but you know,

467
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,560
maybe some,
some of these supplements,

468
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:08,580
who knows.
But anyway,

469
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:11,370
he wanted to know what are the effects 
of meditation?

470
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:12,204
I just regular people,
so they went to the La Costa resort and 

471
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:15,954
spa.
There's already a six day program that 

472
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:20,130
the tow percent of runs with its 
Ayervetic,

473
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:21,210
but it's,
it's yoga,

474
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:23,340
it's meditation,
it's flowed diet,

475
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,870
massage,
not massage.

476
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,703
And this particular one,
although they'd have great massages 

477
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:28,800
there too,
which is also healthy.

478
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,550
And um,
and so what they found was that,

479
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:36,240
and so they compared a vacationers who 
were just staying there at the resort.

480
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,710
They took all their various biological 
markers to novice meditators.

481
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:42,390
They taught them right there.
This is it.

482
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:43,740
Day One,
here's what we do.

483
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,990
Go through it in 20 minutes and 30 
minutes.

484
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:47,290
And so it meditation,
Yoga,

485
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,453
and then a group of people that were 
already there that were serious daily 

486
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,500
Meditators,
they've been doing it their whole lives.

487
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:55,450
Right?
So there was a difference.

488
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,501
Okay.
First of all,

489
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:59,320
everybody got better.
Your blood pressure goes down,

490
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:03,250
stress hormones are practically zero.
And all these great markers,

491
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,310
including the vacationers.
Then they found a difference between the

492
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:07,144
vacationers and the meditation group.
So the claim is that you could go on 

493
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:11,254
vacation,
but you can't do that every day of your 

494
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,354
life,
but you can meditate everyday of your 

495
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:14,950
life.

496
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,060
So the effects of meditation may be 
something like you can do it at home.

497
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,250
Uh,
the relaxation,

498
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:22,720
the meditation,
the focus,

499
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,030
you know,
whatever you call that focus thought,

500
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,740
uh,
on your mantra.

501
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,290
A actually cha has physiological 
changes,

502
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,080
one of which was affecting Beta 
amyloids,

503
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:35,650
which are the kit,
the chemicals that cause the plaques and

504
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:38,620
tangles in neurons that cause 
Alzheimer's.

505
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,233
So Rudy's argument was that it could be,
there's sort of a causal chain there 

506
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,720
that that meditation leads to less 
stress,

507
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:47,554
less inflammation,
and therefore less of these buildup 

508
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,080
plaques and tangles around the neurons.
That kills him.

509
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,060
Cause that's what happens in 
Alzheimer's.

510
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:56,710
Your brain just dies,
neurons die.

511
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,730
So amongst various factors that might be
effective,

512
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,300
meditation may work.
Now someone like Sam who does meditation

513
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:07,510
with,
he would look for a causal chain,

514
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,590
you know,
from the bottom up.

515
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:09,630
What are the,
you know,

516
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:10,464
the effects of having certain thoughts 
in one part of your brain affects a 

517
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:15,070
different part of your brain and that 
causes neuro chemical,

518
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,060
hormonal changes.

519
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,440
And so on.
Deep Buck,

520
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:18,274
of course,
wants to use a different argument and 

521
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:23,710
say it has to do with mind that not,
not brain,

522
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:27,050
but mind consciousness that's out there.
But,

523
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,320
but even saying it's out there is not 
correct,

524
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:30,154
but any guys that,
it doesn't matter what the worldview 

525
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:33,580
differences are,
uh,

526
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,950
in terms of does it work?
If it works,

527
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,761
who cares?
You know,

528
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:39,550
this would be good if,
and people that meditate,

529
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,230
even people that aren't sort of new agey
or,

530
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,690
or eastern religious,
uh,

531
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,940
they say it works.
Uh,

532
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,130
I haven't done it.
My,

533
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:51,130
I don't do it myself and I do other 
things that I think are relaxing,

534
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:52,300
but,
um,

535
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,253
but if it works,
who cares what the explanation is 

536
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:56,400
initially.
Um,

537
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,600
it'd be nice to know something that's 
effective.

538
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:01,660
So it turns out from this new study just
published in nature,

539
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,953
uh,
that meditation seems to be effective 

540
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:06,970
for these biomarkers,
including telomers.

541
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,940
It increases telomerased race,
which causes the telomeres at the end of

542
00:23:09,941 --> 00:23:14,410
your chromosomes to either stay the same
length or to grow a little bit.

543
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,663
And that has direct relations to aging 
because we know that the hayflick limit 

544
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,973
on the number of times a cell can divide
and when you get get to that upper 

545
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:26,500
ceiling,
then the cells are dead.

546
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,470
And that's what causes aging ultimately 
is genetics.

547
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:34,471
So if there was a way to sort of slow 
down the process of the telomere ease,

548
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,913
degrading,
maybe through the production of more 

549
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,100
Tele Marie's chemicals that co you know,
effects that,

550
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:42,934
then if meditation is one of those or 
diet whenever that would be a good 

551
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:46,240
thing.

552
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,073
So down we'll do,
they determine that from studying the 

553
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:49,904
exact same person and studying them 
premeditation in post meditation and 

554
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:56,900
studying the rate the telomeres start to
decline.

555
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,700
But there's particular study,
it was just uh,

556
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,603
uh,
the control group versus the 

557
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:03,860
experimental group,
the meditators versus non-meditators and

558
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,490
the vacationers and how,
but how much of c,

559
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,800
it seems to me that that's something 
that you would want to study over a long

560
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:11,170
period of time.
And then you would,

561
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,043
you would have actually have to study 
the person over a long period of time 

562
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:18,080
before they're meditating to really get 
a base.

563
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,690
I don't know if anyone's done that yet.
Um,

564
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,670
but that would,
that would be good.

565
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,271
Yes,
we need,

566
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:26,210
we need more scientists themselves.
Rudy and his team said,

567
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:27,650
well,
we have to replicate this.

568
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:28,484
You know,
it's just a one shot deal here six days 

569
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:30,830
at a resort.

570
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,570
That was it.
We got to do more of this.

571
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,850
But the point is that,
um,

572
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:35,803
you know,
surely there is some value in some of 

573
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:40,040
these techniques,
whatever you call it,

574
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,023
you know,
so take the word salad out and stop 

575
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:45,800
using words like ground of being or 
whatever.

576
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,960
Forget that.
Just consciousness.

577
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,460
You know,
there's,

578
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,520
there's a certain like way of talking 
that people really enjoy hearing because

579
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:56,000
it makes it sound like,
oh,

580
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:56,834
there's some sort of a mystical 
explanation and solution to all of the 

581
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:04,160
problems that modern day society 
presents you with.

582
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:04,994
And you could find those through this 
course or this lecture or this book or 

583
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:08,774
this practice.
I am now engaging in a practice that 

584
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:13,630
separates me from the stresses of the 
modern life.

585
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,003
But I think that what you're saying 
about meditation and other things that 

586
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:20,690
you do that relax you,
I think it's very important to relax.

587
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,420
And I think we all know that.
And that's one of the real problems with

588
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,400
our world,
our society today,

589
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,950
especially in America,
is so go,

590
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:29,300
go,
go that.

591
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,590
It's like if you are an athlete and you 
train constantly,

592
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:36,140
one of the most important things is 
recovery.

593
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,213
It's a critical aspect of athleticism.
And if you just train and you don't 

594
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:42,290
recover,
your body breaks down,

595
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,453
you're red lining your system and you're
not giving your system the proper time 

596
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:48,410
to recover.
I think that when you meditate,

597
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:49,244
and for me,
my big one is a sensory deprivation 

598
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:52,394
tank.
I have one in my basement and I go in 

599
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:55,084
and all the time,
and it's the most relaxing thing in the 

600
00:25:57,921 --> 00:26:00,980
world because you're going in there,
the water's the same temperature as your

601
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:02,720
body.
It's amazing.

602
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,750
And in doing that,
I feel like that is,

603
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,670
uh,
there's no motion at all.

604
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,533
I'm concentrating completely on my 
breathing until I achieve this certain 

605
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:14,840
state of consciousness that I get to 
when I go in there.

606
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,793
And the way I get to it is just 
concentrating entirely on breathing in 

607
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:20,294
and breathing out.
And I just think about in with the good 

608
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,890
and out with the bad and in with the 
good and,

609
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:27,380
and that's what my only thoughts that I 
try to maintain.

610
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,740
Other thoughts get in there.
They bounce around and they ricochet out

611
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:33,320
and eventually they stop existing.
So it is meditation,

612
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:38,321
it's a meditation,
but I think any form of just right,

613
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,170
just give your body a chance to give 
your heart rate,

614
00:26:42,171 --> 00:26:44,310
a chance to drop,
give your mind

615
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,010
a chance to slow its revolutions per 
minute.

616
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,630
Just give yourself some time to recover.
And then also reflection.

617
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:55,440
Give yourself some time to consider the 
momentum of your life.

618
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:00,590
Because I think that is also a real 
issue with people is that your life sort

619
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:05,751
of starts taking over you and your 
actions and your,

620
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:08,940
your the things that you do during the 
day.

621
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,953
A lot of them would get based on the 
momentum of the things you've already 

622
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:14,850
done versus what you actually want to 
do.

623
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,000
Right.
And it just kind of gets out of hand and

624
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:21,240
you don't have a chance to step back and
look at it and go,

625
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,780
I got to stop doing that,
or I need to do more of this,

626
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,860
or I have to figure a way to not do,
you know,

627
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:30,600
all these things together.
You know,

628
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,543
whatever the decision you make.
But those decisions come out of 

629
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:34,974
reflection,
which comes out of space away from the 

630
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:41,670
actual thing and time and thought,
right.

631
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,500
My Jewish friends telling me that this 
is what the Sabbath is for Friday night,

632
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:49,510
sundown til Saturday.
Sun Sundown makes sense.

633
00:27:49,511 --> 00:27:50,700
That's a time of,
you know,

634
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:51,720
family,
friends,

635
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:53,400
reflection,
no TV,

636
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:55,170
no,
you're off social media,

637
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,640
you know,
and all that stuff.

638
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,713
That makes sense.
I mean it's a smart thing and that's an 

639
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:00,480
old tradition.
So you know,

640
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:01,740
yes.
Set by eight.

641
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,600
Even my Jewish friends are not 
religious.

642
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,463
It's just a cultural thing and that it,
that's probably a good thing now where 

643
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:08,844
it gets a little out of hand.
I think I like another one of my full 

644
00:28:11,101 --> 00:28:11,934
emergence for my chapter on De puck and 
eastern religious traditions of my next 

645
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:17,100
book.
Heavens on earth.

646
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,293
Uh,
we went to see depok and t eckart Toley 

647
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,090
who did a show at the shrine auditorium 
in Los Angeles.

648
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:26,340
The power of now,
the power of now this guy,

649
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,540
I mean this place,
what a,

650
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,290
it must have been 3000 people,
4,000

651
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,060
people there,
uh,

652
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,790
paid 50 bucks a head or,
I mean it,

653
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,270
it was like wow.

654
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,090
All right.
And deep hot cache.

655
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,860
Yes.
I don't know what it costs to rent the,

656
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,360
the shrine,
but those are expensive.

657
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,080
Yeah,
yeah,

658
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,831
yeah.
But you know,

659
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:44,664
the two of them just sort of walked up 
and down the stage and just talked and 

660
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:47,670
uh,
hundreds knows.

661
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,620
Yes.
It's a very much like that.

662
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:50,454
And you know,
the people that attend these are fairly 

663
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:53,904
well off people.
You can sort of tell them the parking 

664
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:56,910
lot how they're dressed.
Same thing with,

665
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,550
uh,
this last weekend I was at the sages and

666
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:02,960
scientists conference at Depok puts on 
every year this year instead of at this,

667
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,980
uh,
at the La Costa resort,

668
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:06,990
it was at the Beverly Wilshire.
Okay.

669
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:10,560
So there's a lot of people from La that 
are depok fans and they go,

670
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,723
you know,
these are not your normal run of the 

671
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:13,591
mill folks.
You know,

672
00:29:13,591 --> 00:29:14,490
these are people that,
you know,

673
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:15,840
upper middleclass,
you know,

674
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,750
good looking well off driving nice cars.

675
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,790
I don't know if you've ever been to the 
Beverly Wilshire,

676
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,650
but if you sit at the,
there's a little bar,

677
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,330
um,
it's uh,

678
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,750
uh,
Wolfgang puck's bar and you know,

679
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:29,850
so they have good German beer,
which my wife and I liked,

680
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,350
cause she's in Germany and we just sit 
there.

681
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,820
The,
when I watch these cars pull up,

682
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:33,670
you know,
Ferrari,

683
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,850
Lamborghini,
Rolls Royce Bentley,

684
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:36,900
and it's like,
okay,

685
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,320
this is not a,
one of my caltech events,

686
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,010
you know,
with science geeks coming,

687
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:42,351
you know,
it's,

688
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:43,184
it's a different audience.
So I do wonder the people that are in 

689
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:48,620
that particular study that Rudy Tanzi 
did,

690
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,780
this is not a randomly picked sample 
from the general population.

691
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,011
You know,
who knows,

692
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:55,990
they have different kinds of problems or
issues,

693
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:56,620
you know,
a lot of them.

694
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,850
Depression,
mental,

695
00:29:57,851 --> 00:29:58,684
you know,
things that might be affected by 

696
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:03,070
psychological states anyway.
You know,

697
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,700
it's different from the physiological 
changes they,

698
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,540
they mark but still,
uh,

699
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:08,374
but when you go,
we watched the shrine auditorium thing 

700
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:11,830
with Eckhart Tolle and he's very 
effective.

701
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,480
You know,
he speaks in a manner,

702
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,600
I can't even imitate it.
It's just very soft,

703
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:17,434
very slow.
I could almost feel myself like melting 

704
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:21,130
into the chair like Ah,
if not,

705
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:22,660
it is very hypnotic.
Yep.

706
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,370
Have you ever been hypnotized?
I have.

707
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,490
Yup.
That's what it feels like.

708
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,080
Right?
Yeah.

709
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,740
So he is probably doing,
yeah,

710
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,863
he's bringing the audience to a certain 
state of thinking and I'm sure it is 

711
00:30:33,161 --> 00:30:37,120
effective for the now and you know,
technically he and d bucher right.

712
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:39,080
That there really is only the,
now you know,

713
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:43,440
about the three seconds or so of the 
current state of before,

714
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,700
after the past.
And before the PR future,

715
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,140
it's just it,
you know,

716
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:47,974
and even your memories of the past,
it's just neurons firing in your brain 

717
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,140
now of what happened in the past and the
future is really,

718
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:56,974
it hasn't happened yet,
but it's just your neurons firing in 

719
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:00,400
anticipation of what might happen.

720
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,080
So they're right.
It really,

721
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,930
they all the action is now,
you know,

722
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:06,550
of course as I like to joke a,
you know,

723
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,800
my three days joe percent or at the,
um,

724
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,810
uh,
at the,

725
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,940
at the new age place up in big Sur,
uh,

726
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,040
um,
what's that?

727
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,760
Uh,
the one on the right on the cliffs,

728
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:17,594
the Isilon Institute that had been there
several times and it's super relaxing 

729
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:22,030
and you know,
but uh,

730
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:24,460
the now ends on Monday morning and to go
back to work,

731
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,230
you know,
my,

732
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:30,120
my mortgage has a now coming up pretty 
soon called the payment and you know,

733
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,730
I don't know to what extent you can live
in that condition all of the time,

734
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,740
but if you take it in moderation,
like,

735
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,110
like you said,
just once in a while to step back once a

736
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:39,430
week,
once a day,

737
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:40,960
whatever.
For 10 minutes,

738
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:44,320
half an hour,
hour deprivation tank once a day.

739
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,530
Something that seems pretty reasonable.
Yeah,

740
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:52,240
very reasonable and very beneficial.
I think those people that you're talking

741
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:53,074
about,
they do have a whole different set of 

742
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:54,874
problems because they have achieved 
material wealth beyond the imagination 

743
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:00,400
of the average person.
If you're pulling up in a Ferrari,

744
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,380
you're essentially pulling up in a 
house.

745
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,243
You're driving a house around,
you're driving a 200 plus thousand 

746
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,530
dollar automobile,
which to most people,

747
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:11,380
it's just crazy like that someone could 
have one of those.

748
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:12,214
So that kind of a person who isn't happy
is the type of person that wants to go 

749
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:20,680
to some sort of a seminar by a health 
guru.

750
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,870
Oh,
look at that Blue Lamborghini.

751
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,340
I mean,
this thing is too much.

752
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,380
Those things will break down the two 
folks,

753
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:28,120
right?
If you're gonna invest,

754
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:28,983
that's not the move Bahrain,
there's probably some oem oil money 

755
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:33,490
here.
I was at,

756
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:36,340
um,
one of the hotels in Beverly Hills.

757
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:40,000
I had dinner there and um,
this [inaudible]

758
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,240
pulled in.
It was a more than a million dollars and

759
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:45,590
a,
I think they're like one point,

760
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:46,424
what didn't we look it up like 1.3,
it doesn't matter one point $3 million 

761
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:50,084
or something like that,
but it had the Saudi Arabian plates on 

762
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:55,460
it and uh,
it actually had palace plates.

763
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,323
It said something palace on it.
So this was some royal person sent his 

764
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:03,010
car over either in a boat or on a plane 
and uh,

765
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,050
there was,
you know,

766
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,933
that car and then there's a million of 
these other super expensive luxury cars 

767
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:11,750
all over the place.
Those people have their own problems and

768
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:12,584
we would like the average person who 
works all day and has a pile of bills 

769
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:17,960
and has all this debt is like,
God damn it.

770
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,823
I would love to be a rich person.
How the hell these fucking rich people 

771
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,690
still have problems?
It doesn't make any sense.

772
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:24,524
But you get used to your life,
you get used to your life and if your 

773
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:32,990
life is being an indigenous person and 
living in Bolivia and the jungle and you

774
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,380
shoot spears at fish and that's how you 
get by.

775
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,450
If that's what you,
you get used to that life,

776
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:39,284
that life becomes your life and you find
problems and maybe you don't find as 

777
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:47,660
many when you were in a hunter gatherer 
tribe as you do,

778
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:48,494
if you're a some sort of a hedge fund 
manager who's just on adderall every 

779
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,773
day,
it's completely stressed out and your 

780
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:55,334
wife driving you crazy and your mistress
wants you to leave your wife and you 

781
00:33:57,951 --> 00:34:00,760
don't know how the fuck you got yourself
into this situation and,

782
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,993
and then you decide I'm going to go to 
this power of now seminar and 

783
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:05,480
straightened my shit out.
Right.

784
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,490
Pull up in your Blue Ferrari.
And it's like there's problems.

785
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:13,670
People create problems and just because 
someone has material wealth,

786
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,863
not only does it not eliminate problems,
it creates a whole new slew of problems 

787
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,893
that would lead to the kind of self 
indulgent sort of exploration of your 

788
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:29,380
condition that these things sort of in 
force and

789
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,580
cater to.
Yup.

790
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,960
Yup.
Yup.

791
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,790
So you got to go back to work the next 
day or whatever.

792
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,620
But another point I made in my talk for 
deep,

793
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,261
by the way,
there,

794
00:34:38,261 --> 00:34:40,180
there he is with the fam,
you know,

795
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:41,680
super,
Super Nice Guy.

796
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,310
I'm sure he really does,
guys,

797
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,800
guy.
Uh,

798
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,850
but um,
like,

799
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,753
um,
if you go to one of these workshops and 

800
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:51,250
you feel much better,
so there's been a few studies,

801
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:52,790
not many like,
uh,

802
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:55,480
big corporations hire people like Tony 
Robbins to come in and,

803
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,770
you know,
give the Spiel to,

804
00:34:56,771 --> 00:34:58,690
they get the salesforce,
I'll fire it up.

805
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,583
And they are,
they are fired up near as we can tell 

806
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,081
the,
you know,

807
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:04,330
the,
the effect lasts for a couple of weeks.

808
00:35:04,331 --> 00:35:05,164
They go back,
they're hitting the phones are making 

809
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,000
those calls or making more money.
It's like,

810
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:08,950
it's work,
but,

811
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:12,010
and then it tapers and they're right 
back to where they were motherfuckers.

812
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,080
So this is why,
uh,

813
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:17,200
we published a study on this and skeptic
that the number one predictor of anybody

814
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:18,034
that would buy one of those books,
self help books or go to the seminars 

815
00:35:19,841 --> 00:35:23,560
are people that have already done so.
And they do an over and over and over.

816
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,600
So in a way,
if it worked,

817
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,450
why do you have to keep buying the books
and the tapes and the,

818
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:33,430
and the going to the seminars and maybe 
it only works for just a little while.

819
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,150
Well,
have you ever heard of it?

820
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,610
The expression

821
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:37,890
that inspiration is like bathing.
It's very effective,

822
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:39,810
but it must be practiced on a regular 
basis.

823
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:40,030
Right?

824
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,500
Well that's,
that could be it.

825
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,820
I think it is.
You know,

826
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:44,710
so there's,
there's two senses in,

827
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,590
does it work,
does it work for you personally?

828
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,140
Uh,
and then does it work for everybody?

829
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,033
So the scientists,
the scientists want to know is not that 

830
00:35:53,591 --> 00:35:54,424
you personally feel better when you went
to the La Casa spa and resort for three 

831
00:35:56,951 --> 00:35:57,790
days of,
of course,

832
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:58,624
I'm sure you did,
but can we actually measure the 

833
00:36:00,551 --> 00:36:02,980
differences and then apply that to 
anybody?

834
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,870
Uh,
and not just that resort,

835
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,820
but any resort or is it like,
you know,

836
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:11,740
60% of the people between ages of 25 and
40 that have these medical conditions or

837
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:13,810
whatever,
when we apply that technique,

838
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,660
you know,
40% of the time they'll get better.

839
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,310
You know,
that's really what we want to know.

840
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,170
So on,
on the one hand,

841
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,981
you know,
somebody says,

842
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:22,750
I went to detox place,
I felt better.

843
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,890
I'm glad that they felt,
you know,

844
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:26,290
the world's a little bit better place if
you feel better.

845
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,270
Okay.
From a scientist perspective,

846
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:29,410
like yeah,
that's interesting,

847
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:33,490
but does it really work?
Not just placebo or not just temporary.

848
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:37,940
It's like a Netflix just released that 
documentary based on um,

849
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,650
Tony Robbins and the film is called,
I am not your guru,

850
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,660
but clearly watching this,
this is what everybody thinks.

851
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,720
That's my girl who they want to be like 
him.

852
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,840
And he has this hypnotic effect on the 
audience.

853
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,820
It's incredible.
I've never seen anything like it,

854
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,000
but the question is when they go home a 
week later,

855
00:36:55,001 --> 00:36:57,310
two weeks later,
did it make any difference?

856
00:36:57,311 --> 00:36:58,900
I mean,
I'm sure they feel better there.

857
00:36:59,110 --> 00:36:59,943
Tony Robbins says a lot of really good 
stuff and he says a lot of really 

858
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:04,510
motivational things that I listened to 
and I was like,

859
00:37:04,511 --> 00:37:07,180
this guy's making a lot of sense.
I bet he does a lot of people,

860
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:08,014
a lot of good.
What I always ask is what has he done 

861
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,500
other than do these seminars?
Yeah.

862
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:15,334
You know,
like he's become really effective in 

863
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:19,750
motivating people.
But what has he done other than motivate

864
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:20,440
people,
right?

865
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,273
I mean he's,
he produced anything other than these 

866
00:37:22,781 --> 00:37:25,450
books that are designed to motivate 
people.

867
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,403
It's like,
I really appreciate what he does and I 

868
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:29,044
don't want to belittle it because I read
a lot of his stuff back when I was 

869
00:37:31,421 --> 00:37:35,050
competing in martial arts and when I was
starting out as a standup comedian,

870
00:37:35,051 --> 00:37:36,610
I read a lot of his stuff,
you know,

871
00:37:36,611 --> 00:37:38,530
and it motivated me and it gave me some 
good,

872
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,900
good things to think about that.

873
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,733
I think I was already sort of on a self 
improvement path and I was trying to 

874
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:46,690
take in a lot of information from a lot 
of different places,

875
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:47,524
including dianetics.
I bought it dianetics book and they 

876
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,300
hounded me for 10 years.
You're on the list.

877
00:37:52,301 --> 00:37:53,134
Heck,
I ordered it late night on one of those 

878
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,673
things.
But I think it's interesting what he's 

879
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:04,381
done because it's not like,
like say if a guy like steve jobs or you

880
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:08,650
know,
a Wazniak who created apple,

881
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:13,710
if they made a book on how to get 
motivated and get something done,

882
00:38:14,411 --> 00:38:19,411
and here's the core core aspects of 
success in this endeavor.

883
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,240
And I've done this and I want you to 
know this,

884
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:23,074
I want to spread this knowledge,
but when a guy is just motivating 

885
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:26,464
people,
right?

886
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,453
I'm always like,
like I know a guy who just motivates 

887
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:29,554
people and he's a terrible comedian and 
he's just decided to start motivating 

888
00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:33,920
people now.

889
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,571
And I'm like,
well,

890
00:38:34,571 --> 00:38:36,140
what the fuck going on here?
But,

891
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,880
but meanwhile people buy it because 
people love that feeling.

892
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,880
They love that feeling of someone saying
something that makes sense,

893
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:44,710
that gets them going.
Yeah,

894
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,813
I'm going to eat plant based and I'm 
going to go jogging every day and I'm 

895
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:49,774
doing yoga four times a week and I'm 
going to drink only water and I'm going 

896
00:38:53,181 --> 00:38:54,070
to,
you know,

897
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:57,130
and then one day they passed by Krispy 
Kreme in that hot.

898
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,520
It's a lot of fresh sign is on those hot
doughnuts.

899
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:02,920
You get one of those glazed hot babies 
in your system.

900
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,130
Yeah.
Thing,

901
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:05,963
you know,
they're having a coffee and they throw 

902
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,400
sugar and it fuck it.
Already have the sugar and the donut.

903
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:10,234
Coffee tastes better with sugar.
You hope it's better than the little 

904
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:13,961
joke about,
you know,

905
00:39:13,961 --> 00:39:15,650
the guy who took an ad out in the 
newspaper says,

906
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,330
send me a dollar.

907
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,260
I'll tell you how to make $1 million,
run an ad in a newspaper and said you,

908
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,513
he's better than that.
Of course is a great collector of 

909
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,820
philosophical points that really can 
affect you if you absorb them.

910
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,413
I think what you pointed out about the 
amount of people that get involved in 

911
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:38,590
these things that don't actually have 
any longterm change in their life.

912
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,280
I think what it's like is like Rehab.
You know,

913
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:46,600
my friend Chris Bell who made this 
recent documentary,

914
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:49,690
prescription thugs and he made bigger,
stronger,

915
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:53,560
faster that documentary on steroids.
Really cool guy.

916
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:56,800
Um,
and it was really fascinating is he went

917
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:59,980
through making this documentary 
prescription thugs,

918
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:00,814
and then in the process of it had a 
pretty significant injury that got him 

919
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,793
on pain pills and then he got hooked on 
pain pills for himself while he's doing 

920
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:12,880
a documentary on pharmaceutical drugs 
being highly addictive.

921
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,743
Yeah.
He went to this rehab and when he came 

922
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:17,284
on the podcast and was discussing the 
rehabilitation process for getting off 

923
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:21,544
these pills,
one of the most important aspects was 

924
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:24,574
how much time it takes and how you have 
to be fully immersed in this idea of 

925
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:33,871
recovery for a long period of time to do
it in this method to,

926
00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:35,094
to in order to enact any real change.
And I think that's probably the same 

927
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:40,564
thing with motivational speakers.
I think you can get that initial burst 

928
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:46,780
where somebody could slap you and go,
Hey Mike,

929
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,590
I'm taking these fucking pills away from
you,

930
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:50,350
man.
You can't keep taking these things.

931
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:50,951
You're hooked.
You're like,

932
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:51,521
you're right,
man.

933
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:52,780
You're right.
I got to change.

934
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,360
So this is both burst of motivation.
You're a good man.

935
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:57,850
You're a smart guy.
You're too smart for these pills.

936
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,811
You're right,
you're right,

937
00:40:58,811 --> 00:40:59,260
you're right.

938
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,093
You get that feeling.
You wake up the next day and you'd go 

939
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:02,134
jog and you get a good sweat and you'd 
go and you'd get some wheat grass juice 

940
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:05,530
and you power that down.
You're like,

941
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,453
I'm on the path.
But then the inspiration dies off and 

942
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:13,840
you so comfortably slide back into your 
old ways.

943
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,273
So I think these motivational speeches 
by Anthony Robbins or any of these 

944
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:20,950
people that I think they can be 
beneficial.

945
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:21,963
But I think for most people,
the comfort of their old path is such a 

946
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:26,494
magnet.
Their compass just just goes towards 

947
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:30,124
that magnet.
It's almost like they needed every day 

948
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,100
for like

949
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,130
a year or two years.
Three years.

950
00:41:36,131 --> 00:41:36,964
Yeah.
Something already Tansy from Harvard 

951
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:41,960
tells me for a normal habit,
it takes about 60 days,

952
00:41:41,961 --> 00:41:45,170
couple of two months,
every single day of retraining the brain

953
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:48,440
on a new habit.
And that's just a regular habit,

954
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:49,274
like drinking coffee or just what time 
you get up in the morning or whatever 

955
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,630
exercise.
Uh,

956
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:54,464
so I suspect with drugs or alcohol,
it's probably a year or two to really 

957
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:01,580
completely re retrain your brain,
rewire the neurons,

958
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,970
literally,
uh,

959
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,250
to,
to change that habit.

960
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:05,510
It's doable.
People do it.

961
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,473
Uh,
it's just,

962
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,220
it can be very difficult.
So I think part of the appeal of the,

963
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,333
the self help groups,
so called self help gurus is that you 

964
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:17,190
keep going because you need the,
you know,

965
00:42:17,191 --> 00:42:18,024
there's sort of retrain reminder every 
six months or you listen to the tapes 

966
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:23,390
once a day or once a week.

967
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,613
Uh,
and it just kind of keeps the new habit 

968
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:27,914
reinforced.
Probably literally dopamine hits from 

969
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:32,900
hearing the voice of the person and 
someone like Tony Robins,

970
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:34,400
I mean he's just,
I've met him at Ted.

971
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:36,110
He's just bigger than life.
I mean he's like six,

972
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:39,860
eight huge hands and deep voice and just
talks.

973
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:42,590
Wonderful.
He's got a great presence.

974
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:43,424
And uh,
he's quite the opposite of Vec are 

975
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:48,200
totally,
I mean he comes out in the stage and the

976
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:50,200
music and the lights,
right side kicks,

977
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,490
boom.
Thrown this out.

978
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,400
Yeah.
And it's like,

979
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,680
oh,
words and shit cause kicks it boards.

980
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,053
But in the film,
this documentary is really quite 

981
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,910
revealing and it's called a,
I'm not your guru.

982
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:01,730
It opens with him talking to this young 
man.

983
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:02,564
He's,
I think he's German and he looks Super 

984
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,193
Sad.
He's what with Bob?

985
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,250
What's,
what's bugging you man?

986
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,790
Stand up.

987
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,020
It's bugging you,
you know,

988
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:09,830
and it's like,
you know,

989
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:13,310
I'm feeling suicidal.
It's as soon as he seen us in front of a

990
00:43:13,311 --> 00:43:15,860
large group of calling is 3000 people in
this hotel room,

991
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:17,300
cameras and lights.
Jesus,

992
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,970
he's going to Powell and he'll,
well,

993
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:22,160
it was a little bit like that,
but it's completely different way.

994
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:22,700
He said,
uh,

995
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,690
he looks down,
he says,

996
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,120
is it the,
is it the red shoes?

997
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,970
He goes,
what is it?

998
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:28,863
You're red.
Those are the fucking red issues I have 

999
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:32,460
ever seen.
May those are fucking red shoes,

1000
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:34,220
dude.
And the camera goes,

1001
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:36,410
Daddy,
he's got these red shoes and this.

1002
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,333
And the way he says it is so funny.
This guy just starts laughing and Tony 

1003
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,560
Goes,
don't you be laughing now because you're

1004
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:45,020
going to spoil the program for suicide.
I mean,

1005
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:46,430
come on.
And the,

1006
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,300
and then he just kind of worked on him 
a,

1007
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,460
you know,
why are you feeling this?

1008
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,140
And before you knew it,
this guy was,

1009
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,023
you know,
he seemed like he was doing much better 

1010
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:57,640
awareness as I pulled out a gun and blew
his brains out on the stage.

1011
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:58,993
The shoes.
I don't think that would've made the 

1012
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:01,574
film.
But the problem with that and another 

1013
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:05,890
story they show in there is,
is there's no followup.

1014
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,450
We,
I have no idea this guy does.

1015
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:09,284
He had another one with a woman who had 
weight issues or something and 

1016
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:15,380
emotional.
Is it your relationship you're in?

1017
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:15,921
Yes.
You know,

1018
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:16,261
he,
he,

1019
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:17,860
he's kind of fit.
Like doctor Laurie,

1020
00:44:17,861 --> 00:44:20,000
he's figured out after all these years,
you know,

1021
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:22,580
your problem number seven years is 
number six.

1022
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,990
There's only like 10 things that covers 
90% of anybody that would come,

1023
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,223
you know,
these are the,

1024
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,950
and a,
so he hones in on its relationship.

1025
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:31,861
Not Happy.
You love him,

1026
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:31,980
but

1027
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,110
you don't really want to be with him 
forever.

1028
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:34,831
Yes.
That's it.

1029
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:36,450
That's it.
Get your phone out,

1030
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,890
but call him right now and it,
whoa.

1031
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,210
There's like,
Holy Shit.

1032
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,810
She's Dr.
Laura Anthony Robbins.

1033
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,910
This is Tony in the,
in the film he says Tony Robbins.

1034
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:50,520
Yeah.
So she calls the guy and he's at work or

1035
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,121
something.
He's like,

1036
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:51,960
yeah,
what's up honey?

1037
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,620
Now I know I,
this is going to be really hard.

1038
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:59,040
But in front of 3000 people in the chat,
she dumps him on the phone.

1039
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,060
Oh,
fucking Christ.

1040
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,520
You know,
this guy is like,

1041
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,840
uh,
where are you again?

1042
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,870
I'm here at the hotel.
Oh,

1043
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,430
click,
dial tone.

1044
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,713
You know,
and then Tony says you did the right 

1045
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:10,921
thing.
Okay.

1046
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:11,754
So the question is,
but how could you make that call not 

1047
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:15,264
knowing anything about that person's 
past and not knowing their behavior 

1048
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:19,020
patterns,
not knowing?

1049
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:19,890
Well,
I mean,

1050
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:22,590
who is she when she's on that stage in 
front of 3000 people?

1051
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,120
Is She really herself?
Right?

1052
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,420
Because most people aren't.
No,

1053
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,273
no,
of course not.

1054
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,680
So you know,
I immediately want to know is,

1055
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:29,640
you know,
two days later,

1056
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:30,743
I'm really sorry.
That seems incredibly irresponsible to 

1057
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:38,370
get someone to break to have so little 
information and to take someone on their

1058
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:39,204
word at that moment.
Like there's some people that the one 

1059
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:43,170
day for whatever reason,
they'll go,

1060
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:44,820
you know what,
I can't fucking do this anymore.

1061
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:45,743
I need to get out of my marriage.
And they'll go to the bar and they'll 

1062
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:48,054
have a drink and they'll get crazy for 
like a few minutes or an hour or 

1063
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:54,090
whatever.
And then they'll drive home,

1064
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:55,860
they'll listen to a song and then their 
wife,

1065
00:45:55,861 --> 00:45:57,480
we'll send them a text and then they'll 
go,

1066
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:58,970
what the fuck is wrong with me?
Right?

1067
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,790
Like why did I think that?
Why am I this?

1068
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,850
And then you realize like you were just 
indulging a certain pattern of behavior.

1069
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:06,803
So how does he know that that woman 
wasn't indulging a certain pattern or 

1070
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:09,960
behavior?
He does it.

1071
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:11,400
He can't possibly know.
On the other hand,

1072
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:12,234
may be she's really,
really stuck and maybe it was really a 

1073
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:18,010
good idea,
but he doesn't know.

1074
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,930
That's right.
He might,

1075
00:46:18,931 --> 00:46:22,170
he might have given her awesome advice,
but he fucking for sure didn't know that

1076
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:23,070
it was awesome advice.
Right,

1077
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:23,904
right,
right.

1078
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:25,950
And that's the problem with all these 
programs,

1079
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:27,920
like,
like Aa in a,

1080
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,180
does it work?
They don't collect data or if they do,

1081
00:46:30,181 --> 00:46:32,190
they don't make it public.
We can't get the data.

1082
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,473
How many,
what percentage of people that come and 

1083
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:35,874
last this many weeks or months and what 
percentage never take a drink or take 

1084
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:40,800
one drink or whatever.
We don't know.

1085
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:41,491
No one knows.
I was,

1086
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:43,530
we have at the anecdotes like I went and
worked for me.

1087
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,363
I went didn't work for me.
Well which is it wasn't there a recent 

1088
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:51,950
study on Aa where they were determining 
that people who,

1089
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:52,963
who leave the pro,
I try to find out if you see if you 

1090
00:46:55,921 --> 00:46:56,850
could find it.
But it was a,

1091
00:46:56,851 --> 00:46:57,684
it was a recent study that was talking 
about sobriety and maintaining sobriety 

1092
00:47:01,561 --> 00:47:04,120
and how little of an impact than it 
actually had.

1093
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:08,250
It did have an impact on people 
maintaining sobriety and they think that

1094
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:09,084
that impact may have been connected to 
the sort of sponsor system that they 

1095
00:47:14,161 --> 00:47:14,994
have and not wanting to disappoint 
people and camaraderie that you develop 

1096
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:21,360
in that sobriety environment,
which makes a lot of sense.

1097
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:24,870
And I think it's really a clever how 
they've structured it in that way.

1098
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,900
Cause I think like having a mentor,
having someone's already done it.

1099
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,070
Right.
And then also I think a big part

1100
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,850
of what leads people to alcoholism 
besides,

1101
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,684
you know,
the genetic markers and all the 

1102
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:39,820
different things where people have like 
an inclination to do it is um,

1103
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,983
they,
there's,

1104
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:44,290
they're trying to medicate themselves.
They're trying to,

1105
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,124
and one of the things is they're trying 
to medicate themselves from a lack of 

1106
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:52,900
companionship or lack of good,
meaningful interaction with people.

1107
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,300
And when you're,
you're,

1108
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,240
you're situation is on the line and sort
of a dire way like,

1109
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:00,160
hey man,
you hit fucking rock bottom.

1110
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,010
We're throwing this booze and the trash 
and you're getting your shit together.

1111
00:48:03,011 --> 00:48:05,440
You're going to fall a 12 step program 
now and you're going to do all it.

1112
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,930
Now all sudden there's some urgency 
involved.

1113
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:09,940
And you have someone who you're 
accountable to.

1114
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,370
You have to call this person,
you're going getting a chip,

1115
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:13,001
you know,
hey,

1116
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:14,170
I'm 90 days,
hey,

1117
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,570
congratulations.
You made it to 90 days.

1118
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,310
And then you go up there and give a 
speech.

1119
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:21,190
So you get all this attention,
which people said desperately crave.

1120
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,190
You get to be on a podium,
everyone's looking at you.

1121
00:48:24,191 --> 00:48:28,000
There's a lot involved in it that's not 
just about sobriety,

1122
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:29,890
about ritual,
social,

1123
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,470
very social,
very social and it,

1124
00:48:32,471 --> 00:48:34,090
and it could be that works.
They've,

1125
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,300
they figured it out over the decades.
That's definitely got something right.

1126
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,360
But there was uh,
the,

1127
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,790
the,
the thing that was stuck,

1128
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,110
the study was showing how little of an 
effect it is a,

1129
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,790
it's a really kind of amazing,
it does have an effect,

1130
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:49,210
but the effect is not that much 
different than people that just quit.

1131
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,463
Like I've known a couple people that are
not involved in any sort of 12 step 

1132
00:48:52,841 --> 00:48:54,880
program.
Like my good Buddy Greg Fitzsimmons,

1133
00:48:55,270 --> 00:49:00,270
he and I have been friends for something
like 27 or 28 years.

1134
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,563
We met as rookie standup comedians.
We started like within a week of each 

1135
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:05,590
other.
And when I met him,

1136
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,510
he was 22,
I believe at the time.

1137
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,553
And he had just quit drinking.
He realized like his parents had issues 

1138
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:14,140
with substance abuse.
And as a young man,

1139
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:14,974
he's like,
look,

1140
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,540
I can't fucking do this.
I'm like,

1141
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:19,270
I'm getting hammered all the time and 
obviously I got the bug,

1142
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,070
whatever it is,
I'm done.

1143
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,340
Right.
And never drank again right here.

1144
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,193
Like literally never drank again.
His whole life to this day hasn't dried 

1145
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,070
and is super successful.
Emmy Award winning writer,

1146
00:49:30,071 --> 00:49:32,530
all these people will still tell him,
you know,

1147
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:33,364
you need to get an a program,
right because you're an alcohol ride 

1148
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,733
drunk.
This is the disease model of alcoholism 

1149
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:43,390
that's bothersome because it's really a 
behavioral choice or behavioral problem.

1150
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:46,600
But if you treat it like a disease that 
the debt,

1151
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,360
the good side of that is that it got 
people off the,

1152
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,560
you're just weak willed.

1153
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:51,880
Um,
you know,

1154
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:52,970
and you just,
that's your product.

1155
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,850
Don't know it isn't bad,
but it isn't.

1156
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,830
It isn't like cancer either.
Like,

1157
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:00,280
oh I'm sorry you got cancer.
I'm sorry you have the alcoholic gene or

1158
00:50:00,281 --> 00:50:01,114
whatever.
Cause clearly like your friend and 

1159
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:05,320
there's a lot of people like that that 
just quit.

1160
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,183
They are able to do it.
And also from the scientific 

1161
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:10,600
perspective,
we don't have much data because we don't

1162
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:11,800
know who they are.
Right.

1163
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,080
They just quit.
They don't go through a program and then

1164
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:17,860
we have them in our database and we know
what they did and how long they came and

1165
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:19,060
so on.
Again,

1166
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,163
does it work?
The only way to know is to really get 

1167
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:24,370
more data on this.
And we just don't have enough,

1168
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,680
you know,
from those kinds of groups that do that.

1169
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:27,590
Like Aa,
there are

1170
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,980
academics who,
scientists who study addiction,

1171
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:31,850
you know,
and they,

1172
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,890
they tell me that,
you know,

1173
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:35,960
the,
for the addict to take a single drink,

1174
00:50:35,961 --> 00:50:37,070
what's the harm?
Just to have a drink.

1175
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:38,210
You're at the bar,
social,

1176
00:50:38,211 --> 00:50:39,044
whatever,
that it's much harder for them to not 

1177
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:41,750
have the second,
third,

1178
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:45,560
fourth and they go till they pass out.
Whereas I never drink till I pass out,

1179
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,570
uh,
in a long time anyway,

1180
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:50,960
since college.
Uh,

1181
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:51,950
but I,
but I,

1182
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,890
it's like the determinism issue for me,
it's not an,

1183
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,260
it's not a problem.
It's not a self control problem.

1184
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,610
Uh,
but for the addict,

1185
00:50:58,611 --> 00:51:01,970
apparently the,
the brain is rewired and they,

1186
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,970
it's much harder for them to stop.
Have that second drink.

1187
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,950
Isn't it rewiring thing or is it a 
genetic predisposition?

1188
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:10,070
Boeing.
It's both.

1189
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:10,861
Yeah,
it's probably a,

1190
00:51:10,861 --> 00:51:13,280
a plethora of variables,
right?

1191
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:16,220
The contribute only the native American 
population,

1192
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,060
uh,
the,

1193
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:22,060
the genetics are such that they have a,
a stronger alcoholism problem,

1194
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:26,450
which is exasperated by the poverty and 
you know,

1195
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:27,284
all the other social issues that go with
that and on these reservations and it 

1196
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:31,010
makes it even worse.

1197
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,690
But apparently there is a genetic 
component.

1198
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:36,110
I would like to know if that's true 
because I remember this discussion being

1199
00:51:36,111 --> 00:51:36,944
brought up before with someone else and 
then I looked it up and I found 

1200
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:41,240
something that had showed contrary 
evidence,

1201
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:42,100
but oh,
okay.

1202
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,033
Anecdotally,
sort of everybody who knows that story 

1203
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:49,070
knows that native.
That's what we've always been told.

1204
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,230
Yeah.
Native Americans didn't have alcohol and

1205
00:51:51,231 --> 00:51:54,350
their history and like there was,
um,

1206
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,270
and I could be wrong on that.
I haven't looked at that,

1207
00:51:56,271 --> 00:51:59,180
any of that data in decades.
So they could be old material now.

1208
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,193
Well,
jeans most certainly do get affected by 

1209
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:03,974
Diet and climate and where people evolve
and we're where their ancestors came 

1210
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:10,010
from.
There's,

1211
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,470
there was a study,
um,

1212
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,580
today,
what did I put?

1213
00:52:13,581 --> 00:52:18,581
I tweeted something today that made 
sense why some people can follow a Vegan

1214
00:52:20,151 --> 00:52:20,984
Diet and be healthy in regards to Omega 
threes is that if you come from a long 

1215
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:27,254
line of people who have followed a 
predominantly vegetarian diet over the 

1216
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:31,724
course of over a hundred years or so,
the genetics start to evolve or change 

1217
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:37,904
and adapt to his diet to the point where
your body produces more omega threes 

1218
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,680
from different things.

1219
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,780
It was real recently.
Um,

1220
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,530
I,
uh,

1221
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,440
I tweeted it this afternoon or retweeted
it.

1222
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,950
The troublesome thing about Aa is,
is the religious component,

1223
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,280
not so much you,
you have to believe in God.

1224
00:52:54,281 --> 00:52:54,671
No,
no,

1225
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:54,860
no,
no.

1226
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,780
That's why they should supplement with 
it.

1227
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:57,614
It's more recent than that.
Did I see something about Omega threes 

1228
00:52:59,901 --> 00:53:03,380
may not be as healthy as we thought.
We believe that.

1229
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:07,300
I'd never know what that tank,
I don't have enough time.

1230
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,143
Science keeps changing.
She keeps that you're supposed to 

1231
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,360
believe in a higher power for aa to 
work,

1232
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,630
but that year,
uh,

1233
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,860
in a much,
much more insidious way,

1234
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:17,630
I think you're a,
you're like a sinner.

1235
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,060
You were an original center.
You are an alcoholic.

1236
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:21,270
Say it.
I'm an ally.

1237
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,030
I,
my name is Michael and I'm an alcoholic.

1238
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,850
It's like the born again.
Uh,

1239
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,220
I'm a sinner.
I was born

1240
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,660
sinful,
but I accept Jesus.

1241
00:53:27,661 --> 00:53:32,250
Wouldn't it be better to say in my name 
is Michael Shermer and I am a free man.

1242
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,330
I liked him.
Yeah,

1243
00:53:34,331 --> 00:53:35,100
I'm not,
I'm not,

1244
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,940
I'm not trapped by any sort of a drug or
alcohol that would be more empowering.

1245
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:40,303
Seems way better.
And that would be the Tony Robbins 

1246
00:53:42,121 --> 00:53:43,800
approach.
You can change it.

1247
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,753
So it's thrown sidekicks and shit.
If you just see the thing that happened 

1248
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:50,840
with Tony Robbins recently where they 
had one of those coal walk firewall,

1249
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:54,830
but these assholes were taking selfies 
while they were firewalking and they put

1250
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,730
their feet.
Yeah,

1251
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,480
I can't believe he's still does the 
fireworks.

1252
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,680
You know,
cause it's a little risky.

1253
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:04,830
I've done it twice.
We did it once for a Fox TV show.

1254
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,023
And first of all,
we had a hard time finding any place to 

1255
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:10,200
do it.
But you did it as a skeptic to prove.

1256
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,720
Explain.
Well explain the whole I wanted,

1257
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,580
first of all,
I wonder what the experience is like.

1258
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:17,340
And then second,
what is the explanation?

1259
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:18,940
Why?
Why is it your feet don't get burnt?

1260
00:54:18,941 --> 00:54:19,774
Like in one of the shows we actually 
strapped raw steaks to my feet and you 

1261
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:26,430
know,
and then walked across the coals and you

1262
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:28,380
know,
the stakes didn't get burned if you just

1263
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:29,214
walk quickly enough.
So either dead meat is conscious and 

1264
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:35,790
thinking positive thoughts or it has 
nothing to do with positive thoughts.

1265
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,590
Didn't get cooked at all.
No,

1266
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:38,424
no.
Because if you move fairly quickly that 

1267
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,900
the conductance of the heat is very slow
with wood.

1268
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:44,063
So the analogy is this,
you put your turn the oven up to 450 

1269
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:49,200
degrees and you put a cake in and you 
let it sit there for a while.

1270
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:52,140
You open the pay and you put your hand 
in the air is 450 degrees,

1271
00:54:52,141 --> 00:54:53,220
but you don't get burnt.

1272
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:56,910
You touch the cake and it's 450 degrees.
You don't get burnt.

1273
00:54:56,911 --> 00:54:57,744
But you touch the cake pan or the the 
metal part of the oven and you're burnt 

1274
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:03,720
almost instantly.
The temperature is all the same.

1275
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:04,583
It's the heat conductivity.
That is how quickly a material Trans 

1276
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,530
Duce as heat from,
from it to you,

1277
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,400
which is why we cook on steel versus the
actual Cole's themselves.

1278
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:15,000
Yeah,
yeah.

1279
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,833
Right.
Because the Cole's or a poor conductor 

1280
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:17,970
of heat,
uh,

1281
00:55:17,971 --> 00:55:19,170
so if you,
okay,

1282
00:55:19,171 --> 00:55:23,110
but the PR,
the thing with firewalking is this,

1283
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:25,710
you won't get burned if the bed is 
about,

1284
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:28,740
uh,
no longer than about 10 to 15 feet.

1285
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,173
Eight feet is better and you have maybe 
a flat of grass that's wet on either 

1286
00:55:34,561 --> 00:55:35,394
side so that you're,
the temperature of the bottom of your 

1287
00:55:37,351 --> 00:55:40,110
feet is a little bit cooler and then you
traipse across,

1288
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:41,990
don't stop to take selfies,
big mistakes.

1289
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,930
Uh,
but if you go above 15 to 20 feet,

1290
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:46,793
uh,
the heat's going to start to build up 

1291
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:49,693
and there you can get burned.
So my guess is what happened with was 

1292
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:53,940
his people is,
it was a short,

1293
00:55:53,941 --> 00:55:54,960
probably a short bed,
but,

1294
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:58,230
but probably they,
they didn't scoot across fairly quickly.

1295
00:55:58,231 --> 00:56:00,630
The two times I did it,
it was an eight foot bed.

1296
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:01,980
You know,
I didn't mess around.

1297
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:03,370
Man.
I just plowed right across.

1298
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:07,470
It's very anxiety,
you know?

1299
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,690
Is there a fun there?
Yeah,

1300
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,630
these people are so silly.
If you Google Michael Shermer fire walk,

1301
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:14,910
there's a video that's a very short 
little firewatch,

1302
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,490
very short.
And to the see the flames on the side,

1303
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,700
they put wood on there after it's burned
for hours and hours,

1304
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:21,900
and then they put,
um,

1305
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,250
like cooking.
So at the flames

1306
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,800
are coming up.
So from it from an angle,

1307
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:29,020
it makes it look like you're almost 
walking through the flames,

1308
00:56:29,021 --> 00:56:31,060
which you're not what,
it's sort of in some ways,

1309
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:33,650
like kind of a rite of passage,
that passage or something.

1310
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,240
It's like,
it's,

1311
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,370
it's what you're doing is like a 
ritualistic thing.

1312
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:38,230
I feel like I'm,
it's a metaphor.

1313
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:40,120
It's a metaphor for accomplishing 
things.

1314
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,370
Yes.
It really doesn't mean anything.

1315
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:43,540
Well,
the problem is when,

1316
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:44,374
you know what you just said,
now that metaphor is not going to 

1317
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,194
fucking work anymore.
So he just ruined all of this stuff is 

1318
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,780
all the people that could have possibly 
gotten over the hump.

1319
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:55,510
Now that you've ruined it,
Michael Shermer,

1320
00:56:55,511 --> 00:56:56,320
how dare you?
Yep.

1321
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:56,951
Yep.
So,

1322
00:56:56,951 --> 00:56:58,300
uh,
well,

1323
00:56:58,301 --> 00:56:59,770
I mean,
we want to know how does it work?

1324
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,251
Right.
You know,

1325
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:01,960
and I said,
if he had a bed of metal,

1326
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:02,711
you know,
no one would,

1327
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:03,430
could walk on it.

1328
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:04,720
Not,
not even Tony Robbins,

1329
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:05,554
no matter how positive he was thinking.
So dead wood coals is a poor conductor 

1330
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:11,200
of heat.
That's it.

1331
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,580
That's all it is.
Yeah.

1332
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:14,950
That makes a ton of sense.
That's why,

1333
00:57:14,951 --> 00:57:16,240
you know,
when you have a grill,

1334
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:17,074
you put the coals down and then you put 
that steel grate over the grill steels 

1335
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:22,370
and excellent ends up through.
Yeah.

1336
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,493
Yeah.
And that's why we choose certain metals 

1337
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:26,530
as well to cook in.
You know,

1338
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:27,940
it's,
it's,

1339
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:30,700
I'm amazed he could get insurance for 
this because people do get burned.

1340
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,230
And the ones we did,
uh,

1341
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,990
some of the people,
other people had little blisters because

1342
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:35,883
you know,
if you've,

1343
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:38,120
if you've walked slowly or you have 10,
you know,

1344
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:38,973
I'd go beg for it a lot.
So I have pretty good callouses on the 

1345
00:57:40,511 --> 00:57:42,130
bottom of my feet.
But if you don't,

1346
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,053
you know that then your skin is thinner 
and it's temperature builds up faster 

1347
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:48,220
for that and you're quite likely to get 
the blisters,

1348
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,010
especially if you get pedicures and 
you'd put moisture on your,

1349
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,510
yeah,
you're always like fear a tenderfoot.

1350
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,890
Literally that's going to be a 
tenderfoot.

1351
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,760
That's right.
That was the cub scout thing,

1352
00:57:57,761 --> 00:57:59,590
right?
Tender foot and the beginning.

1353
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:02,610
That's hilarious.
What a hilarious way to describe it.

1354
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,910
With all these things,
you know it,

1355
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,370
all things in moderation.
It's the extreme isn't it?

1356
00:58:06,371 --> 00:58:07,630
Gets people in trouble.
You know?

1357
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:11,110
It's like you can never have a drink,
you can never have a piece of meat.

1358
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:15,310
You can never do this or that and that.
And then when you go off the wagon,

1359
00:58:15,311 --> 00:58:16,144
so to speak,
then if you feel like a sinner and it's 

1360
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:18,960
back to that religious thing,
you know,

1361
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:19,993
sin,
you're a bad person and that adds too 

1362
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:23,111
many,
I think,

1363
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:23,944
negative emotional elements to behavior.
Then you're connecting all of these 

1364
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:33,300
ideologies to your behavior that are 
very constrictive and very constricting,

1365
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:35,524
and you're not allowed to deviate from 
these plans and then you become a part 

1366
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:40,180
of this sort of team,
right?

1367
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,360
Like the people that are in crossfit.
You ever,

1368
00:58:42,361 --> 00:58:44,360
have you ever met a crossfit person?
I know the shots,

1369
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,840
the workout of the day,
right?

1370
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:49,180
And it's positive.
They're in shape,

1371
00:58:49,181 --> 00:58:50,980
they look,
but they look crazy.

1372
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:52,960
Like they can't wait to go back and do 
chin ups.

1373
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,820
Right.
Do they get out of their mind?

1374
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:57,880
And it's a very beneficial thing.
Don't get me wrong,

1375
00:58:57,881 --> 00:58:58,714
but there's a thing that people do when 
they get a part of a team or a group or 

1376
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,950
you're,
you're one of those now,

1377
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:06,851
you know,
hey,

1378
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:09,280
I'm a,
I'm an ultra marathon runner right now.

1379
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:10,990
And like,
I'm in that group.

1380
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:11,893
That's right.
Yep.

1381
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,753
Yep.
I just reviewed this book for The Wall 

1382
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,793
Street Journal and Cross fit training 
and what it means to be fit now versus 

1383
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,240
when I was in my twenties say,
and uh,

1384
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:20,890
you know,
back when Nautilus was,

1385
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,780
you know,
the idea was you're going to isolate the

1386
00:59:23,781 --> 00:59:25,640
muscle groups.
Everybody's like,

1387
00:59:25,641 --> 00:59:26,570
yeah,
that's good.

1388
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:28,870
Isolate the muscle groups.
So there's authors line,

1389
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,860
why is that good?
Whoever where,

1390
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,753
how did it ever get established that 
isolating the muscle group is a good 

1391
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:36,110
thing and he shows that you know,
free weights,

1392
00:59:36,111 --> 00:59:39,080
you're using all of your body,
every muscle tendon,

1393
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,750
just the balance and the move and all 
that stuff.

1394
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:43,820
It's much better.
But then I more,

1395
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:44,654
I looked into it,
I thought,

1396
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,530
well of course this is when high 
schools,

1397
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,360
it started introducing physical educate.
You got to go in the gym,

1398
00:59:50,361 --> 00:59:51,194
everybody's in the gym.
You can't turn loose thousands of 

1399
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:56,510
teenage kids and free weight rooms and 
not have injuries.

1400
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:57,883
So the Nautilus machine,
that was the solution to isolate and no 

1401
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:01,430
one's going to get hurt.
You can turn loose,

1402
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,264
somebody does,
you can't clean and jerk a big weight 

1403
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,490
and not have somebody explained how to 
do it without getting hurt.

1404
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,260
Yeah,
that's certainly true.

1405
01:00:09,261 --> 01:00:10,094
But I think the big aspect of it was 
people like to make things more 

1406
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:15,014
complicated than they need to be.
Or they always like to invent some new 

1407
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:21,530
way to do things and sometimes that new 
way to do things looks awesome.

1408
01:00:21,531 --> 01:00:22,670
Like a Nautilus machine,
right?

1409
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:23,504
I mean they have the big cam system and 
there's tables and you get to the 

1410
01:00:26,391 --> 01:00:28,400
plates,
you put the pin in the plate and you get

1411
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:30,370
to move it up and down and it's all 
right.

1412
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,333
I mean it looks amazing,
but as far as like it being beneficial 

1413
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:35,384
to promoting functional strength is not 
nearly as good as those like Olympic 

1414
01:00:39,111 --> 01:00:41,120
lifts that people do like clean and 
press.

1415
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,250
But those are not that glamorous.
You know?

1416
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:45,440
Those machines are very glamorous.
You know,

1417
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,293
you could,
you could tell people that you're 

1418
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,920
pulling the whole stack.

1419
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:50,450
Look,
I've got the whole stack,

1420
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,720
right.
It'd be those isolating movements at one

1421
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:54,554
point in time were thought to be the 
best way to develop muscle because 

1422
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,960
they're really good for bodybuilding,
you know?

1423
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:04,640
But there's a difference between like 
when someone looks really good,

1424
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,330
like there's certain looks that you can 
achieve like giant biceps,

1425
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,164
right?
Where they're completely out of balance 

1426
01:01:10,281 --> 01:01:12,590
but they didn't have like a little knack
and they have no legs.

1427
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:14,870
It's not,
it's not healthy,

1428
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:18,460
but they want big biceps so they just 
keep constantly doing referrals.

1429
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:22,280
So you can get like really out of whack 
doing those sorts of exercises if you're

1430
01:01:22,281 --> 01:01:27,050
not careful.
But if you want to be a bodybuilder,

1431
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:27,913
that was always the protocol.
Like if you look at how Arnold lifted 

1432
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:31,263
now a lot of these Franco Columbo,
guys like they were all in isolation 

1433
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,880
exercises,
a lot of different,

1434
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,033
they did a lot of tricep extensions,
they did a lot of things to pump those 

1435
01:01:39,951 --> 01:01:41,260
muscles up.
They did,

1436
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,910
you know,
squats and leg presses and stuff too.

1437
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:44,744
But a lot of it was involving like 
hitting specific muscle groups to 

1438
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:50,330
accentuate those,
you know?

1439
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:54,620
But it's just wasn't the way to go.
But people for a long time thought those

1440
01:01:54,621 --> 01:01:56,750
machines were the shit they were like,
this is,

1441
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:57,420
this is my cell,

1442
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,250
Lucian.
And my review,

1443
01:01:59,251 --> 01:02:02,700
I wrote about this guy I met back in the
80s when I get into bike racing,

1444
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:06,030
name filled grenache Shya.
He was Mister California bodybuilder.

1445
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:11,330
Um,
in 1954 the year I was born and three of

1446
01:02:11,331 --> 01:02:13,320
the 50s and early sixties,
he was,

1447
01:02:13,321 --> 01:02:14,490
you know,
just lifting weights.

1448
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,130
Mr Bodybuilder,
many Mehta cyclists and said,

1449
01:02:17,131 --> 01:02:17,964
well,
why don't you cut in San Francisco when 

1450
01:02:18,571 --> 01:02:19,404
she come out,
got the Sunday ride going up in the 

1451
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:22,800
local hills.
Oh I'm going to kick their ass.

1452
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,650
Kicked your ass,
said he got dropped at the first hill,

1453
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,600
they're gone.
And you realize,

1454
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:28,890
wait a minute,
maybe I'm not fit.

1455
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:29,724
You know,
he was mister t nine Miss California 

1456
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:31,974
yet,
but also Mr fitness or the most fit 

1457
01:02:33,331 --> 01:02:35,850
person in California.
So you realize I'm not fit.

1458
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,980
I got no cardiovascular.
So that's,

1459
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:40,470
he took up cycling and so on.
But um,

1460
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,750
you know,
so this crossfit book,

1461
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,070
it was that these people are more 
balanced.

1462
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:45,090
That was the idea,
I guess.

1463
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:47,850
Cause you don't even know what you're 
going to do for the competition.

1464
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:48,684
Right.
You show up and it could be any one of 

1465
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:53,070
these different tasks so you have to be 
more well rounded.

1466
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,030
Well as opposed to I can lift this one 
particular noddle is wait,

1467
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:58,583
I read something about crossfit taking a
critical role in our society that if 

1468
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,393
there was a comparison to crossfit and 
religion and they were saying that 

1469
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,263
essentially as people become more 
secular and they move away from 

1470
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:12,564
religion,
they gravitate towards things like 

1471
01:03:14,101 --> 01:03:14,934
crossfit.
They give him this sort of sense of 

1472
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:16,764
community and shared experience and uh,
like uncommon shared experience because 

1473
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,680
the average person you go to work and 
you got cows that are bleeding.

1474
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:27,660
Yeah.
Did my workout of the day to day.

1475
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:28,733
Like just something like separates Mike 
from the pack as he passes the break 

1476
01:03:32,151 --> 01:03:32,350
room.

1477
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:36,510
Like Mike's fucking crazy doing chin ups
every morning at 6:00

1478
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:37,343
AM when a bunch of other assholes down 
on supple va at the crossfit center and 

1479
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:41,923
you,
you get this feeling like I belong to 

1480
01:03:43,741 --> 01:03:44,574
this group of unusual people doing 
unusual things and it's a social 

1481
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:49,710
process.
And also that's,

1482
01:03:49,711 --> 01:03:52,020
well that's what religions do and you 
know,

1483
01:03:52,021 --> 01:03:52,854
it's,
it's our group here and we're meeting 

1484
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:56,340
once a week or whatever,
and we had these rituals.

1485
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,500
It's all like that.
They're very attractive to people.

1486
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,920
Those things vary.
There's a book called Bowling alone,

1487
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:05,730
uh,
by sociologists that it sort of tracking

1488
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:09,300
the decline of social things like 
bullying,

1489
01:04:09,301 --> 01:04:10,260
bully leagues,
you know,

1490
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:12,443
very many bowling leagues anymore.
But more and more things like that were 

1491
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,850
more isolated.
We do our own thing and your computer at

1492
01:04:17,851 --> 01:04:20,040
home or whatever,
and that this is actually,

1493
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:21,930
it's a good thing to get out there and 
have a community,

1494
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,310
but as always,
you know,

1495
01:04:23,311 --> 01:04:25,050
it's the extremism that,
you know,

1496
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,690
I'm going to do this six hours a day,
easy.

1497
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,240
This guy failed.
We're now,

1498
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,074
she ended up dying.
He ended up dying early because he just 

1499
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:35,640
worked out like eight hours a day.
He keeled over dead in his gym.

1500
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:37,380
I don't know what the cause is.
Christ.

1501
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,430
Yeah.
And,

1502
01:04:38,431 --> 01:04:38,761
uh,
you know,

1503
01:04:38,761 --> 01:04:39,594
I mean it's like God he used,
he had this workout routine that he had 

1504
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:43,374
a like a $5,000
challenge that anybody that could match 

1505
01:04:45,451 --> 01:04:46,284
him for the 45 minute workout routine in
his home gym and Olympic cyclist would 

1506
01:04:49,831 --> 01:04:50,664
come and all these super steadily guys 
and no one ever made it cause it was so 

1507
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:56,430
specialized for just what he does.
You know,

1508
01:04:56,431 --> 01:05:00,540
like one arm chin ups or you know,
one arm pushups or you know,

1509
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:01,374
the stairmaster.
He built his own stair master before 

1510
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,160
anyone had stair masters and he would 
just,

1511
01:05:05,161 --> 01:05:05,994
you know,
just crank it up at such a high level 

1512
01:05:07,351 --> 01:05:08,700
that you just can't do it.

1513
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:13,710
And that's all he did.
Was He fit,

1514
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:15,360
you know,
was he healthy fit?

1515
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:18,220
I don't know.
Well up to the point where your dad,

1516
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,450
yeah,
that's probably an argument for once you

1517
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,313
die from it.
I know you're probably not doing it 

1518
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:25,190
right.
We used to ride around Orange County and

1519
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:28,810
he'd go see that lady out there Sunday 
morning getting her papers,

1520
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:29,740
cigarette,
coffee,

1521
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,230
donut.
She's going to check out early.

1522
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,210
You.
Oh,

1523
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:36,070
that chick's probably still pissing on 
his grave.

1524
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:40,330
There's only so much we can do.
She shows up every morning.

1525
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:42,123
I just reviewed this a,
another book for Wall Street Journal 

1526
01:05:43,931 --> 01:05:46,390
called why men age about aging.
What we know,

1527
01:05:46,391 --> 01:05:48,040
and we know a lot,
but there's,

1528
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,850
there's also know there's a lot.
There's only so much you can do.

1529
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:54,610
You know that.
Why is it just men?

1530
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:56,340
Uh,
the guy was teeth.

1531
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,060
He's a doc who treats men for Jesus.

1532
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,280
There's also a big difference.
Well,

1533
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:04,000
there are some differences,
but I think there's,

1534
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:04,893
I think from a marketing perspective,
if there's already a bunch of books up 

1535
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:10,120
for women on aging,
there's not much about men.

1536
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:11,580
But that was it.
It doesn't,

1537
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:14,200
it doesn't really matter because it's 
really all the same process.

1538
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:17,510
Ultimately,
your telomers we'll get you and the idea

1539
01:06:17,511 --> 01:06:17,681
of,
well,

1540
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:20,260
we live twice as long as our ancestors 
did a century ago,

1541
01:06:20,261 --> 01:06:20,831
you know?
Yeah,

1542
01:06:20,831 --> 01:06:21,664
that's true.
But really no one's living above 120 

1543
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:24,963
just more and more people are pushing up
to the upper ceiling because of public 

1544
01:06:27,731 --> 01:06:30,910
health and just general stuff we do that
makes us healthier.

1545
01:06:30,911 --> 01:06:31,744
But in terms of longevity and aging,
you can't stop it as you can do is kind 

1546
01:06:34,821 --> 01:06:39,380
of hopefully slow it down a little bit 
and you want to have a higher quality of

1547
01:06:39,381 --> 01:06:40,214
life the further up you go as opposed to
lying in bed with tubes for the last 10 

1548
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:45,790
years of your life or something like 
that.

1549
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:48,070
So that was,
that's where the future research is,

1550
01:06:48,071 --> 01:06:49,540
where the breakthroughs will come.
Not,

1551
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:52,930
not radical life extension lists that 
I've also written about.

1552
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:55,050
You know,
we're going to have 500 years there.

1553
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:56,560
Schermer don't you want to live 500 
years?

1554
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:57,403
Like look,
just get me to 90 without Alzheimer's 

1555
01:06:59,501 --> 01:07:00,334
and cancer.
Okay,

1556
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,970
let's just start one decade at a time.
It just easy,

1557
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,070
you know,
because you know,

1558
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:06,953
the problems are really complex.
I think the quality of life thing that 

1559
01:07:09,581 --> 01:07:11,380
you mentioned is one of the most 
important things.

1560
01:07:11,381 --> 01:07:15,220
Like I have this phrase that I've said 
many times,

1561
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:17,110
but I'm gonna say it cause it fits right
here.

1562
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,930
We all love to sleep,
but everyone's afraid to die.

1563
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:23,770
We love to shut off,
we love to shut off at night.

1564
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,990
Everybody loves it.
And we look forward to it.

1565
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:30,130
But that one big shutoff when you're not
coming back is just too fucked up.

1566
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:32,440
It's just too much.
Well,

1567
01:07:32,441 --> 01:07:33,610
here it's thing,
it's inevitable.

1568
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,380
This is my,
in my next book,

1569
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:36,500
I have a chapter called,
uh,

1570
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,633
afterlife for atheists.
So these are not just the radical life 

1571
01:07:40,241 --> 01:07:43,040
extension is,
but the p the mine up loaders and,

1572
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:44,141
and so,
you know,

1573
01:07:44,141 --> 01:07:46,960
you're going to scan your connectome,
put it in a computer,

1574
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:47,973
and then you know,
you'll wake up in the computer like 

1575
01:07:49,001 --> 01:07:51,790
Johnny Depp in that,
here's the problem.

1576
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:54,160
When you go to sleep,
then you wake up tomorrow,

1577
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:56,840
maybe you're groggy for a few minutes,
but then you're,

1578
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,000
you're,
you're back.

1579
01:07:58,001 --> 01:07:58,834
You still feel like you,
there's a continuity between today and 

1580
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,240
tomorrow or you get general anesthesia 
surgery.

1581
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,163
You wake up,
you're groggy or for a little bit 

1582
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:08,350
longer,
but the continuity comes back.

1583
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:10,690
It's still you.
So the question is,

1584
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:11,524
is if you're,
you die and we have a scan of your 

1585
01:08:14,561 --> 01:08:17,810
connectome and we put it in a computer 
and turn it on.

1586
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:21,920
Are you going to wake up in the computer
like you did from sleep then?

1587
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:25,100
I don't think so.
I think it would just be a copy of your,

1588
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:26,323
if this could ever be done,
which is very unlikely because it's 

1589
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,260
super hard problem,
but let's just say it could.

1590
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,513
Um,
I think there's a break in continuity 

1591
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:36,230
from death.
You're dead.

1592
01:08:36,231 --> 01:08:39,050
That's it and this thing we have is a 
copy of you.

1593
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:44,170
It would be like if we cloned your body 
and then you die and then we reconstruct

1594
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:46,730
the body and there you are.
That's not you.

1595
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,670
Not first person through the eyes.
Me,

1596
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,260
it's just a copy of me,

1597
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:52,943
devil's advocate.
If I was going to play devil's advocate 

1598
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:55,254
to that,
what I would say is with our current 

1599
01:08:56,581 --> 01:08:59,700
understanding and abilities right now,
you're correct.

1600
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:03,330
However,
whatever we have right now,

1601
01:09:03,331 --> 01:09:04,164
whatever we are right now,
if we can understand it down to the 

1602
01:09:09,511 --> 01:09:12,960
subatomic particles,
if we can literally go understand you as

1603
01:09:12,961 --> 01:09:15,450
a person like you as you stand right 
here,

1604
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:16,284
September 15th,
2016 if we can understand every single 

1605
01:09:21,721 --> 01:09:24,060
aspect of you,
including consciousness,

1606
01:09:24,061 --> 01:09:24,894
we're not there yet.
Obviously there's a lot of debates and 

1607
01:09:26,431 --> 01:09:29,820
does a lot of the struggles,
but we're looking at it in terms of what

1608
01:09:29,821 --> 01:09:30,654
our current understanding is.
If we looked at it in terms of the 

1609
01:09:32,881 --> 01:09:33,714
understanding of people that lived in 
the year 100 and it would be a 

1610
01:09:38,131 --> 01:09:41,640
completely different idea of 
possibilities,

1611
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:42,563
like our possibilities today are 
incredibly expensive in comparison to 

1612
01:09:46,231 --> 01:09:48,990
people that lived in 1776.

1613
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:50,063
Just the idea of what we,
what we understand about what it means 

1614
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:56,640
when you talk about atoms,
molecules.

1615
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,550
Uh,
the,

1616
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:59,080
the idea of Telenor is all these,
uh,

1617
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:02,820
all the knowledge that we have today.
Imagine that expanding exponentially for

1618
01:10:02,821 --> 01:10:07,800
the next 500 a thousand years,
it's entirely possible that if we get to

1619
01:10:07,801 --> 01:10:11,700
that point,
we can recreate reality to a point where

1620
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,590
I have a theory about people and it's 
composed this completely unqualified and

1621
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:21,150
don't listen to me,
but I think it's entirely possible that,

1622
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:25,740
you know how bees make honey.
I think people might make the universe.

1623
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:29,850
I think it's entirely possible that the 
way the universe makes itself,

1624
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,760
it makes a person,
it makes a monkey.

1625
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:34,500
The monkey eventually figures out how 
to,

1626
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:37,950
a way to not get eaten by leopards and 
the smart ones become a monkey.

1627
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:38,933
And then they figure out shelter and 
then they figured out agriculture and 

1628
01:10:41,341 --> 01:10:42,330
then they really get going.

1629
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:43,253
And once they really get going,
what they start doing is creating 

1630
01:10:44,821 --> 01:10:45,654
technology that wait in the form of a 
wheel on the form of a bucket to carry 

1631
01:10:48,841 --> 01:10:49,674
the water so they don't have to keep 
drinking out of the river and getting 

1632
01:10:50,971 --> 01:10:51,804
crocodiles and fucking Giardia and 
everybody's dying from in inborn 

1633
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,450
disease.
We figure things out slowly but surely.

1634
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,433
And along the way they make better and 
better things until they develop 

1635
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:03,024
computers,
until they develop artificial 

1636
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:08,430
intelligence to make something that can 
think for itself.

1637
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:13,080
And then they put that thing to work and
that thing gets better in two weeks than

1638
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,780
thousand years of human development.
Right.

1639
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:16,853
And I think that thing probably is how 
the universe gets created that the 

1640
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:22,194
universe,
like this idea that the universe has no 

1641
01:11:23,701 --> 01:11:27,420
beginning and no end,
that it's his infinite cycle of maybe,

1642
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:32,040
and maybe it does that through people,
maybe it makes people and in our through

1643
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,770
through intelligence of some kind,
some sort of intelligence.

1644
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:37,740
But what we currently understand and 
know of the known universe,

1645
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,000
we're the only ones that we know of and 
we're looking at what we're doing.

1646
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,551
They're like,
Whoa,

1647
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:42,091
whoa,
whoa,

1648
01:11:42,091 --> 01:11:42,924
Whoa,
whoa.

1649
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,670
What are we doing?
Like what are we,

1650
01:11:44,671 --> 01:11:46,590
where are we going with this?
We can just going to keep going.

1651
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:50,130
Like when Elon Musk start talking about 
artificial intelligence,

1652
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,133
who's one of the most important and 
popular and famous technology 

1653
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:57,384
enthusiasts starts talking about 
artificial intelligence being summoning 

1654
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:03,450
the demon.
I mean that's how he described it.

1655
01:12:03,451 --> 01:12:07,890
We can be summoning the demon.
I really think that might be what we do.

1656
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:08,873
I think we're getting caught up in the 
Kardashians and we're looking at it 

1657
01:12:11,111 --> 01:12:14,400
who's got a fake but and you know,
are those chem trails in the sky?

1658
01:12:14,401 --> 01:12:17,050
And I'm in a 12 step program,
I'm fucking crossfit.

1659
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,173
And meanwhile what we're doing is we're 
given birth to some new form of 

1660
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:28,410
transcendent technology that literally 
rewires reality itself.

1661
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,700
Yup.
Well that is an actual theory.

1662
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:31,391
Uh,
you know,

1663
01:12:31,391 --> 01:12:32,224
the,
that we're living in the matrix that 

1664
01:12:33,011 --> 01:12:37,060
it's all a computer simulation and it's 
equivalent of a holodeck somewhere.

1665
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:39,970
But I don't even know if we was so real 
there.

1666
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:43,810
If it was so really you couldn't 
distinguish between the holiday of world

1667
01:12:43,811 --> 01:12:46,450
you're in and this world,
then how would you know?

1668
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:48,003
So it really becomes one of these 
thought experiments that's fine to 

1669
01:12:50,711 --> 01:12:51,544
contemplate,
but how would you test it to see if it 

1670
01:12:53,801 --> 01:12:55,600
was true or not?
And so the,

1671
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:58,420
uh,
what do you pulling up there?

1672
01:12:58,421 --> 01:13:01,310
Just googled his name and ai.
And this came up from yesterday.

1673
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,500
Let's talk about neural lace.
Oh,

1674
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:04,920
well this is,
you know,

1675
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:06,730
Kurzweil has been talking about this for
a long time.

1676
01:13:06,731 --> 01:13:07,564
You know,
the singularity really will come about 

1677
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:10,483
with a fusion between human intelligence
and artificial intelligence for people 

1678
01:13:13,661 --> 01:13:15,310
who listen and read the,
uh,

1679
01:13:15,311 --> 01:13:15,940
the title there.

1680
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:17,080
Jamie,
what does it say in there?

1681
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:20,650
Scroll up.
Elon musk hints that neural lace project

1682
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:24,220
to fuse ai with the human brain.
Well,

1683
01:13:24,221 --> 01:13:27,250
in a way,
a cochlear implant.

1684
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,160
We just said Cook.
Do you know what that means?

1685
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:36,450
Cochlear cut means now we'll,
we'll go over that another time.

1686
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:38,380
Oh,
it's a new insults on the Internet.

1687
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:39,830
A cook.
Yeah.

1688
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:40,670
See you.
Okay.

1689
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:41,920
See,
you see Kay.

1690
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,530
Okay.
So let's cut and fuck.

1691
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,160
No,
no,

1692
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:45,581
no,
no,

1693
01:13:45,581 --> 01:13:46,361
no.
Well,

1694
01:13:46,361 --> 01:13:47,340
in some ways,
but it's,

1695
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,610
it's,
it started off with cuckold.

1696
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:50,320
Oh,
right.

1697
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,153
Which was men who want other men to 
steal their women and have sex with 

1698
01:13:54,281 --> 01:13:55,870
them.
And then somehow or another,

1699
01:13:55,871 --> 01:13:56,704
it became an insult.
A that it seems to have a bunch of 

1700
01:13:59,621 --> 01:14:02,530
different meanings,
but it's fun to use because it's new.

1701
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:03,370
Yeah.
It's interesting.

1702
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:04,750
Uh,
uh,

1703
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,790
I'm,
I'm hosting a,

1704
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:06,873
one of our sites,
the conservative insult of the mountain 

1705
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,400
explained.
That's a cook serve explicit.

1706
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,410
Let's pull that down.
We need to know what the explanation is.

1707
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,600
Hmm.
redstate.com

1708
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,510
blah blah blah daily car.
Oh,

1709
01:14:19,511 --> 01:14:21,120
I serve it live.
Yeah.

1710
01:14:21,121 --> 01:14:25,810
See cuckold is just when you're,
you've been cheated on tech serve it.

1711
01:14:25,811 --> 01:14:26,531
Iv.
Okay.

1712
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:27,331
Port men do.
Yeah.

1713
01:14:27,331 --> 01:14:28,960
It's just a fun,
it's not real,

1714
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:32,080
it's just a fun,
but it's interesting because,

1715
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:33,190
uh,
certain,

1716
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:34,713
uh,
you know,

1717
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,820
four letter words,
curse words,

1718
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:37,713
uh,
that they have certain characteristics 

1719
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:43,300
of the words themselves that are,
tend to be short and kind of guttural,

1720
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:44,410
um,
abrupt.

1721
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,820
You know,
fuck cut shit.

1722
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:47,190
It's on.
And,

1723
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:48,970
and there's a book coming out called 
what,

1724
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:49,863
what the F uh,
Benjamin Bergen is a linguist at uc San 

1725
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,900
Diego and he's coming up to do our 
science alon in a few weeks.

1726
01:14:55,901 --> 01:14:56,734
And,
and so the idea is that certain words 

1727
01:14:58,691 --> 01:15:03,691
trigger more sort of deep emotional 
parts of the brain and the limbic system

1728
01:15:04,391 --> 01:15:04,810
and so on.

1729
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:08,320
They're associated with bodily a flew 
via,

1730
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:10,510
you know,
feces,

1731
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:12,430
sperm and so on.
It's just,

1732
01:15:12,431 --> 01:15:17,020
it's all this kind of crass,
basic cumins.

1733
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,033
Cause the idea is to,
you want to hurt somebody with your 

1734
01:15:20,081 --> 01:15:23,200
words emotionally.
And by associating it with the,

1735
01:15:23,201 --> 01:15:24,034
you know,
sort of a deep part of the brain that's 

1736
01:15:24,731 --> 01:15:25,564
associated with really deep emotional 
things that that's the theory is there 

1737
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:31,660
is like a tale about why curse words are
what they are.

1738
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:33,820
You know,
why certain words are just,

1739
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,650
they're not insulting.
They're just kind of funny.

1740
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:38,250
Funky.
Yeah.

1741
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:38,960
Yeah.
K.

1742
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:39,221
Dot.
Right.

1743
01:15:39,221 --> 01:15:41,290
So any with a knee,
you know,

1744
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:43,000
that's just not gonna.
It's too sweet.

1745
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:43,811
Yeah,
right.

1746
01:15:43,811 --> 01:15:46,120
It's like a,
like a nice nickname for a friend,

1747
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:49,240
so I'm not surprised at all that that 
work is what it is.

1748
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:50,800
Yeah.
It makes perfect sense.

1749
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:52,900
Just based on the structure I didn't 
fuck or the ticket.

1750
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:54,970
These are two of the worst things you 
could say to somebody.

1751
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,820
That's why cock is so popular because it
seems like,

1752
01:15:57,821 --> 01:15:59,140
wow,
I think we got a new one.

1753
01:15:59,141 --> 01:15:59,974
It has that sort of feel and surprise 
that it's conservative and cuckold 

1754
01:16:02,981 --> 01:16:05,710
instead of what I thought it was.
That's just a new one.

1755
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:08,290
That's a new one that they're adding to 
the word cock.

1756
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:09,520
Okay.
Yeah.

1757
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:10,540
It's a,
well,

1758
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:11,374
to make the Oxford English dictionary,
it has to be used like a certain number 

1759
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:17,320
of times and in secondary and tertiary 
sources in a year.

1760
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:21,820
Oh well it's done then.
It's in for sure 100% yeah.

1761
01:16:21,821 --> 01:16:25,480
The Internet is just the amount of data 
that gets,

1762
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:26,523
what's the figure about how much data 
gets pushed on the Internet in a day 

1763
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:33,160
that I think it's the short amount of 
time,

1764
01:16:33,161 --> 01:16:35,410
I forget what the window is,
but in that time,

1765
01:16:35,411 --> 01:16:37,340
more data gets passed in,
in,

1766
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,990
in the entirety of human history.
That's a,

1767
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:43,670
that was at the beginning of Peter 
Diamandis,

1768
01:16:43,671 --> 01:16:45,010
his book on,
uh,

1769
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,340
the,
the rapid growth of technology.

1770
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:50,223
Um,
it's some insane was like every month 

1771
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:53,374
now.
It's the equivalent of all everything 

1772
01:16:54,851 --> 01:16:56,950
that's ever been printed in the history 
of humanity.

1773
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:58,930
I don't have to look,
it's just a huge number.

1774
01:16:59,050 --> 01:16:59,883
It's just think about that and then 
think about how many books Ron Hubbard 

1775
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:04,084
must've written this.
L Ron Hubbard wrote more books than 

1776
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:07,480
anyone who's ever lived.
You know,

1777
01:17:07,481 --> 01:17:10,010
if you got to the scientology around the
world,

1778
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:14,540
they all have a room with his desk.
And a writing pad.

1779
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,493
It's like,
it's literally like this Casey comes 

1780
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:18,464
back,
Tom B l Ron comes stumbling through the 

1781
01:17:22,701 --> 01:17:23,534
door with rotten clothes and skins 
hanging off of his bones and time to 

1782
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:29,084
write.
This chart shows what is done on the 

1783
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,560
Internet every minute.
Right?

1784
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:35,070
Wow.
He's 16.

1785
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:40,510
So it's got snapchat at the top with 6 
million 94040004444.

1786
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:45,343
Google.
Google is the most but owned by 10 fold 

1787
01:17:47,961 --> 01:17:50,000
more than snapchat,
which is kind of crazy.

1788
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,013
But that's just translating words.
These are different things that are 

1789
01:17:52,971 --> 01:17:54,020
happening.
Right.

1790
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:56,690
How many different interactions?
Yeah.

1791
01:17:57,170 --> 01:18:00,740
That's amazing.
That is fucking crazy.

1792
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:02,780
So I mean if he would carry out your 
argument,

1793
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:04,790
you know,
it's just only a matter of time before,

1794
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:05,931
uh,
you know,

1795
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,430
sort of that singularity is reached.
And then,

1796
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:09,470
uh,
I mean,

1797
01:18:09,471 --> 01:18:10,304
one argument for the singularity,
you create the virtual reality that's 

1798
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:13,903
indistinguishable.

1799
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:14,773
It's just a,
yeah,

1800
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:15,613
you just need enough data.
It's really an engineering problem and 

1801
01:18:18,171 --> 01:18:19,004
time.
But the question would still be in that 

1802
01:18:21,021 --> 01:18:21,854
world.
Would you feel like you right now 

1803
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:27,550
through the eyes?
First person experiencing why not me?

1804
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,420
Why not?
I don't know.

1805
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,310
Uh,
I'm not sure that it would.

1806
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:32,420
I'm not,
I'm not sure either.

1807
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:33,463
I mean,
I kind of see the cryonics argument 

1808
01:18:34,601 --> 01:18:37,040
because it being chronically frozen and 
waken up,

1809
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:39,650
woken up again.
If you could make that happen,

1810
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,500
that seems like fall asleep.
Wake up,

1811
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:45,740
anesthesia,
wake up chronically frozen,

1812
01:18:45,741 --> 01:18:48,560
wake up.
It's feels to me like it's the same mark

1813
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:49,403
of the flora in your thinking is 
consciousness is not in your mind and 

1814
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:55,250
consciousness is indicis that surrounds 
you.

1815
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:58,490
It's right.
It is transcendent.

1816
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,073
I need to study a good depok impression.
Cause that one that's racist as fuck 

1817
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:06,020
your average Indian guy.

1818
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,690
Well this is what he argues,
that when you die,

1819
01:19:11,691 --> 01:19:12,524
your consciousness,
your mind goes to where it was before 

1820
01:19:14,991 --> 01:19:15,830
you were born.
Yeah.

1821
01:19:15,831 --> 01:19:18,020
But the problem is you don't fucking 
know that.

1822
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:19,880
Well,
no one and no one knows that.

1823
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:21,560
So you can't say that.
That's what it does.

1824
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,930
My argument is what?
Where were you before you were born?

1825
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:25,580
I mean,
most people go,

1826
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:26,660
well,
what do you mean?

1827
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:29,060
That's a non question.
I wasn't anywhere before I was born.

1828
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:29,894
Right.
And when you die that you won't be 

1829
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:32,060
anywhere now.
So,

1830
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:34,460
but maybe by Buddhists think that,
um,

1831
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:35,953
you know,
that you just returned to the 

1832
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:38,920
consciousness in the sky,
the forest,

1833
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:40,370
this,
wherever it is.

1834
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:45,020
I think our number one problem is that 
we try to have a place where you go,

1835
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,820
we try to have an explanation.
Yeah.

1836
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:47,663
We feel like it's a place,
but depok tells me this is completely 

1837
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:52,260
wrong way to say it.
You're,

1838
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:54,560
you're not going any place.
There's no place.

1839
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,960
Hmm.
Well,

1840
01:19:56,961 --> 01:19:58,760
here's the problem.
Even with that,

1841
01:19:58,970 --> 01:19:59,803
I think there's an issue with saying 
that you know anything about what 

1842
01:20:03,741 --> 01:20:05,330
happens after death,
right?

1843
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,100
You could have a ton of theories.
You can have

1844
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,030
like possibilities that you ponder.
You could sit down and be as creative as

1845
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:15,460
you want.
You could start and think about the,

1846
01:20:15,461 --> 01:20:16,294
the number of known stars in the 
universe and then start to perceive how 

1847
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:21,443
immense the universe is and what,
what is going on in consciousness 

1848
01:20:24,481 --> 01:20:25,400
itself.
And when it,

1849
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,530
when it ends,
does that energy go somewhere and become

1850
01:20:28,531 --> 01:20:31,320
some thing that we haven't considered?
You could do that all day long.

1851
01:20:31,321 --> 01:20:32,400
Right?
And it's fun.

1852
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:33,593
But the problem is when anyone says they
know when you go back to become a baby 

1853
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:42,030
again and your start the world from how 
the fuck do you know you don't?

1854
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:45,180
The answer is don't.
It's interesting to think that you might

1855
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:47,730
be a baby again.
It's interesting to think that you might

1856
01:20:47,731 --> 01:20:48,564
live you like I've heard the,
I forget what religion promotes this 

1857
01:20:51,421 --> 01:20:52,254
possibility,
but that you live your entire life over 

1858
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:57,150
and over and over again until you get it
right.

1859
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:59,940
And that's where the term old soul comes
from.

1860
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:03,900
Like you're running like you're 
obviously a very wise man,

1861
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:04,734
Michael Shermer.
So you probably were an idiot a few 

1862
01:21:06,451 --> 01:21:07,284
hundred thousand generations ago,
but you've gotten to this point where 

1863
01:21:10,141 --> 01:21:12,160
you've,
you've figured out how to live your life

1864
01:21:12,161 --> 01:21:12,994
very harmoniously and in doing that you,
you exhibit all the traits of an old 

1865
01:21:17,131 --> 01:21:18,810
soul.
This is instead of,

1866
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,670
you know,
there's certain people up there,

1867
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,073
you know,
we all have seen them on the Internet 

1868
01:21:22,831 --> 01:21:24,750
that do ridiculous things and it's just 
like,

1869
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:26,340
why are they so stupid?
Why are they doing?

1870
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:29,300
Well maybe they've only is their third 
or fourth go around.

1871
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:31,260
Yeah.
Maybe that's the,

1872
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,050
that is entirely possible.
We don't know.

1873
01:21:34,051 --> 01:21:34,884
You don't know why you were born.
You don't know what happens when you 

1874
01:21:36,721 --> 01:21:37,554
die.
The problem is in saying that you have 

1875
01:21:40,081 --> 01:21:41,340
an explanation,
right?

1876
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:45,630
Whether it's a materialist,
very cold,

1877
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:46,583
scientific analysis of the possibilities
in terms of like what we know today and 

1878
01:21:50,401 --> 01:21:51,234
deny any possibilities of anything being
anything other than death being the end 

1879
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:56,480
like that.
We don't know that either.

1880
01:21:57,090 --> 01:21:57,811
Well,
okay.

1881
01:21:57,811 --> 01:21:58,644
Right.
That's correct.

1882
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:03,330
But so from the scientific,
no hypothesis that is your theory is not

1883
01:22:03,331 --> 01:22:08,331
true until proven otherwise we would be,
nothing happens when you're dead,

1884
01:22:08,671 --> 01:22:09,870
you're just gone.
Could be,

1885
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:13,140
and t unless there's some other 
alternative we can test.

1886
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:14,003
Right.
So my,

1887
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:16,390
one of my favorite thought experiments 
comes from Carl Sagan,

1888
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:18,810
demon haunted world.
Awesome book,

1889
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,430
Awesome Book.
The chapter is called,

1890
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:22,170
there's a dragon.
In my garage.

1891
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:24,090
So,
uh,

1892
01:22:24,091 --> 01:22:25,130
I tell you,
Joe,

1893
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:26,820
I have a dragon in my garage.
You do?

1894
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,200
So cool.
Can I see it?

1895
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:28,771
Yeah,
yeah,

1896
01:22:28,771 --> 01:22:29,280
yeah.
Here.

1897
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,480
Curious.
I opened the garage door.

1898
01:22:30,481 --> 01:22:32,760
You look in and there's some paint cans.
A ladder.

1899
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:34,650
A bike,
no dragon.

1900
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,440
Oh,
well it's an invisible dragon.

1901
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,930
Okay,
so you say a,

1902
01:22:39,931 --> 01:22:40,764
well,
let's put some powder down on the 

1903
01:22:41,341 --> 01:22:42,560
ground.
And when he walks around,

1904
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:44,300
we'll see his footprints.
Well,

1905
01:22:44,301 --> 01:22:47,790
you see this dragon hovers about three 
feet above the ground at all times.

1906
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:49,230
And you say,
well,

1907
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:52,050
I got some infrared cameras here.
We could detect the heat.

1908
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:55,920
Now this is a cold blooded drag and it 
gives us no temperature at all.

1909
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:57,390
You know,
oh,

1910
01:22:57,391 --> 01:23:00,360
I have this heat detector and when it 
spits out the fire,

1911
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:02,040
then we'll see that the fire comes out 
of it.

1912
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:03,510
And that'll prove that,
well,

1913
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:04,410
no,
it's coal fire.

1914
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:07,510
Now this is not heat generating.
Five is a very special kind of fire.

1915
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:08,763
Okay,
so seconds point is what's the 

1916
01:23:09,491 --> 01:23:10,840
difference between,
and you know,

1917
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:11,703
invisible hovering cold in detectable,
immeasurable dragon and no dragon at 

1918
01:23:16,961 --> 01:23:19,270
all.
So if there's not,

1919
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:21,460
if there's not some way for us to get at
it,

1920
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:24,270
then we can't assume it exists.
Exactly.

1921
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:26,350
I would.
I apply that to God.

1922
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:27,783
You know,
cause people do all God is outside of 

1923
01:23:28,511 --> 01:23:29,740
space and time.
Okay.

1924
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:33,160
How do you know if he's outside of space
and time and no way to measure it?

1925
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:34,563
Well,
he reaches into the art world to stir 

1926
01:23:36,101 --> 01:23:37,600
the particles,
cure the cancer,

1927
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:39,220
whatever.
Okay.

1928
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,083
Can we measure that and does it look 
different from what happens naturally 

1929
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:44,693
now?
There's why w w why is it that would 

1930
01:23:45,701 --> 01:23:46,534
always,
God always cures is things that might 

1931
01:23:48,331 --> 01:23:50,230
have gotten better anyway.
You know,

1932
01:23:50,231 --> 01:23:53,470
tumors do go into remission and,
but most of them don't.

1933
01:23:53,471 --> 01:23:54,550
Most people,
they get cancer,

1934
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:56,560
they die.
So why didn't God heal them?

1935
01:23:56,561 --> 01:23:59,230
He only seems to heal the ones that 
naturally go into remission.

1936
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:00,453
How come he doesn't grow amputated limbs
for Christian soldiers coming back from 

1937
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:06,250
a rack?
How come,

1938
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:08,410
you know,
these are Christian families praying for

1939
01:24:08,411 --> 01:24:10,750
their Christian loved ones who lost a 
limb.

1940
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:13,420
You know he's busy curing cancer over 
here,

1941
01:24:13,421 --> 01:24:17,620
but why can't he handled the ones that 
never ever naturally grow back?

1942
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:20,880
What's the difference between a 
invisible dragon?

1943
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:21,470
No Dragon.
Oh,

1944
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:22,303
that's so always you know when yet.
But this is my theory of the afterlife 

1945
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:26,080
would,
that's nice.

1946
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:27,513
How do you know

1947
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:29,500
you do not?
You do not know.

1948
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,393
And when it comes to religion,
the idea of some sort of a powerful 

1949
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:39,850
being that's in charge of the whole 
picture and it's got a grand plan for it

1950
01:24:39,851 --> 01:24:40,684
all is a,
it's kind of comforting to some people 

1951
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,280
and it's,
and it's an interesting possibility.

1952
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:47,770
And again,
it's something to consider.

1953
01:24:47,771 --> 01:24:48,604
It's something to think about.
It's an idea that's been around for a 

1954
01:24:50,441 --> 01:24:52,660
long time.
Why has it been around for so long?

1955
01:24:52,661 --> 01:24:53,860
I don't know.
Well,

1956
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:57,130
let's go over some of the other things 
that had been around for a long time.

1957
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:58,013
Let's look at what else is in that book.
Is there any other shit in that book 

1958
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:03,010
that you might think is ridiculous?
Oh,

1959
01:25:03,011 --> 01:25:03,844
isn't there a story in that book about 
two children that taught demand because 

1960
01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:10,090
he's bald.
So they sick bears on the kids.

1961
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:13,010
Do you remember that story in the Bible?
Was it with his name?

1962
01:25:13,011 --> 01:25:13,844
But Lisa has what it was is the guy's 
name who is taunted by these children 

1963
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:22,330
because of his baldness.
So God's summons to bears to come out of

1964
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:23,164
the woods and mall these children and 
kill them because they taunted his be 

1965
01:25:27,341 --> 01:25:29,560
fade with the Old Testament.
I mean,

1966
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:30,723
but if you're talking to someone who's a
religious person who believes in the 

1967
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:37,180
Bible and you throw that around,
one of the first things that goes well,

1968
01:25:37,181 --> 01:25:38,620
that's the Old Testament,
right?

1969
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,490
Well,
okay,

1970
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:41,540
so the Old Testament is not valid.
Right?

1971
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:42,423
The New Testament,
the one that was written by constant 

1972
01:25:44,041 --> 01:25:47,350
teen and a group of bishops,
when they got down,

1973
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:51,100
they thought they wrote it out for what?
500 years after Jesus died.

1974
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:53,850
That one's legit.
I see that.

1975
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:55,483
Yeah.
We got some more ridiculous when 

1976
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:58,270
everyone,
cause constantine wasn't even,

1977
01:25:58,540 --> 01:25:59,730
he wasn't even Christian.
Wow.

1978
01:25:59,731 --> 01:26:00,430
Well

1979
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:01,320
yeah.
Well,

1980
01:26:01,321 --> 01:26:04,070
Tom in the gospels appear to be 30

1981
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,110
to 60,
the first one,

1982
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,790
30 to 60 years after Jesus died,
book of Mark,

1983
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:12,180
the others were copied from mark.
Obviously John is really weird and uh,

1984
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,340
you know,
no one knew him.

1985
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:14,061
These weren't,
you know,

1986
01:26:14,061 --> 01:26:16,850
the Gospel authors didn't know they 
weren't his disciples,

1987
01:26:16,851 --> 01:26:19,010
they didn't know him.
So this is second hand,

1988
01:26:19,011 --> 01:26:20,120
third hand,
whatever.

1989
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,600
And there was a committee that decided 
what that's right.

1990
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:26,270
Scott Bass for example,
was voted out.

1991
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:27,163
Why?
Well,

1992
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:28,083
yeah,
who knows?

1993
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,770
It's a twitter poll.
Take a twitter poll.

1994
01:26:30,771 --> 01:26:34,280
Yeah.
The got all together evil twitter poll.

1995
01:26:34,281 --> 01:26:36,950
Yes.
And any case,

1996
01:26:36,951 --> 01:26:38,780
where did Jesus become a conservative?
You know,

1997
01:26:38,781 --> 01:26:41,330
I mean in the,
in the gospels he talks about,

1998
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:41,841
uh,
you know,

1999
01:26:41,841 --> 01:26:44,300
giving up your belongings,
taken care of the poor,

2000
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:45,553
you know,
uh,

2001
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:46,463
the chances of a rich man going to 
heaven or it's like going through the 

2002
01:26:49,431 --> 01:26:50,150
eye of a needle.

2003
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:54,080
You can't do it made wine for people 
carpenter.

2004
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:54,951
Yeah,
yeah,

2005
01:26:54,951 --> 01:26:56,120
yeah.
Right.

2006
01:26:56,121 --> 01:26:57,260
So,
um,

2007
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:01,880
his conservative values would be suspect
if you actually read what he said.

2008
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:03,830
Yeah.
I mean all the depictions of them,

2009
01:27:03,831 --> 01:27:04,664
it looks like a fucking hippie.
It was like a dirty white hippie 

2010
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:08,830
somehow.
Another white guy,

2011
01:27:08,831 --> 01:27:13,831
I grew up in the Middle East and you 
know the year zero I have a feeling they

2012
01:27:15,051 --> 01:27:17,480
probably looked like they look now,
don't you think?

2013
01:27:17,481 --> 01:27:18,314
I mean why is that guy looks so like he 
looks like a lost kid who lives in 

2014
01:27:22,341 --> 01:27:25,590
Idaho.
He's rebelling from his parents and well

2015
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:29,690
I think that's what made the life of 
Brian such a great film money pipeline.

2016
01:27:29,691 --> 01:27:33,260
It's like they really nailed it and they
nailed it a long time ago.

2017
01:27:33,261 --> 01:27:37,100
Right back when you really couldn't do 
of this before blazing saddles.

2018
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:42,660
It was super controversial movie at the 
time and groundbreaking in terms of like

2019
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:45,463
people,
we look at comedy from like the 60s or 

2020
01:27:48,171 --> 01:27:49,004
the 70s and we look at it in terms of 
what we know to be shocking and crazy 

2021
01:27:54,231 --> 01:27:57,050
today and it's our bar's so different,
right?

2022
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:57,933
It's hard when you go back and watch 
those things to really take in the 

2023
01:28:00,921 --> 01:28:01,754
context of,
I was talking to Guy Tory about this 

2024
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:07,370
funny comedian friend of mine about this
last night.

2025
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:08,204
We were talking about um,
how good lenny bruce was and how we 

2026
01:28:12,351 --> 01:28:15,530
really can understand it because comedy 
is sort of,

2027
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:16,423
it continues to progress and it sort of 
reflects the attitudes of the times and 

2028
01:28:20,391 --> 01:28:21,224
we're so much more open minded and so 
much further down the line than we were 

2029
01:28:25,251 --> 01:28:29,970
in 1960 whatever when lenny was getting 
arrested for using bad words.

2030
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:30,804
Right?
So it's hard for us to preciate it's 

2031
01:28:32,871 --> 01:28:33,704
hard for us to really understand like if
we were kids back then and we went to 

2032
01:28:35,901 --> 01:28:36,734
see Lenny Bruce and we were living in 
this like really restrictive 

2033
01:28:39,261 --> 01:28:43,040
environment,
that was the 1950s in 1960s then we'd be

2034
01:28:43,041 --> 01:28:45,350
blown away by it.
Like what is he saying?

2035
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:46,183
This is right.
But today you listen to it and it's 

2036
01:28:48,831 --> 01:28:49,664
almost pedestrian or have some of the 
stuff that he has to say because it's 

2037
01:28:52,191 --> 01:28:54,740
already been said because he broke down 
the door.

2038
01:28:54,741 --> 01:28:55,521
Then it was like,
yeah,

2039
01:28:55,521 --> 01:28:58,730
that holds been there forever.
And they could even make blazing saddles

2040
01:28:58,731 --> 01:28:59,600
today because,
you know,

2041
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:01,920
they use the n word constantly.
You're out there.

2042
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:03,920
It's good point.
Could you make that movie,

2043
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:04,913
uh,
one of the characters has that line 

2044
01:29:05,971 --> 01:29:06,840
about a,
okay,

2045
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:09,420
well let him the niggers in the big,
but not the Irish.

2046
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:11,370
That's right.
Whoa.

2047
01:29:11,371 --> 01:29:14,130
You wouldn't say that today.
Even in us had tire.

2048
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:17,130
We'll think about a character like 
archie bunker.

2049
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:18,300
Oh,
right,

2050
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:19,350
right.
All in the family.

2051
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:21,800
You couldn't do that show today the way 
it is you,

2052
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:23,213
it would be hateful and horrible and 
they blago sphere would erupt the 

2053
01:29:27,691 --> 01:29:28,524
honeymooners.
Jackie gleason used to threaten to beat 

2054
01:29:30,511 --> 01:29:32,150
his wife,
all the to the moon.

2055
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:37,260
He was gonna hit her so hard,
he's going to put her on the moon.

2056
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,540
Right.
Hilarious.

2057
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,080
Oh boy.
People used to smack people all the time

2058
01:29:43,081 --> 01:29:44,070
in movies.
Back then,

2059
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:46,380
men were always beating women up.
Right.

2060
01:29:46,410 --> 01:29:47,243
It was like a natural part of behavior 
to the point where we didn't even mind 

2061
01:29:51,151 --> 01:29:51,984
it from heroes.
Heroes with smack a woman in the mouth 

2062
01:29:54,661 --> 01:29:55,470
and she'd be like,
Ooh.

2063
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:57,720
And then they would invariably wind up 
fucking them.

2064
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:01,320
Like right afterwards they'd smack them 
and then they start making out.

2065
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,200
Seinfeld is a little riff on Paul 
Mccartney's.

2066
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:06,780
Uh,
you got to run for your life.

2067
01:30:06,781 --> 01:30:09,550
You better run for your life if you can 
a little girl,

2068
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:12,240
cause I'll get you in the end.
And then the other one was,

2069
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:14,850
she was just 17,
if you know what I mean.

2070
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:16,440
Like,
no Paul,

2071
01:30:16,441 --> 01:30:19,710
what do you mean?
What are we talking about here?

2072
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,740
But that's early sixties.
It was normal.

2073
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:24,420
Like how about kiss?
They had that song,

2074
01:30:24,421 --> 01:30:27,690
Christine 16,
Gene Simmons a sang that song.

2075
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,730
All right,
that was a big hit.

2076
01:30:29,731 --> 01:30:32,370
Christine's 16.
I've got to hover.

2077
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:34,770
Oh God.
Yeah.

2078
01:30:34,771 --> 01:30:36,720
Well or you got to have you.
Yeah,

2079
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:37,613
I think that's a good song.
But it's fucked up when you go back and 

2080
01:30:42,841 --> 01:30:44,100
listen to it,
you know,

2081
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:45,270
you realize like,
wow,

2082
01:30:45,271 --> 01:30:47,990
like you're singing about a little baby,
right.

2083
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,690
You know,
like,

2084
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:50,440
and you realize when you become,
you know,

2085
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:54,300
I'm 49 now.
When you look at like a 16 year old,

2086
01:30:54,301 --> 01:30:57,080
you're like,
Jesus Christ like kid.

2087
01:30:57,140 --> 01:31:00,600
We'll give her a couple of years even 
eighteens ridiculous.

2088
01:31:00,601 --> 01:31:01,434
Right,
right.

2089
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,800
So what is legal and what is not legal 
is very strange,

2090
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:06,030
but those songs,
man.

2091
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:07,883
So you know,
in terms of moral progress that that 

2092
01:31:09,271 --> 01:31:12,060
kind of change happens to slow enough.
You don't really notice it,

2093
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,820
but looking back a few decades,
it's like,

2094
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:15,833
wow,
look what they used to say in movies or 

2095
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:18,144
novels.

2096
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:20,610
What does this compilation immense mcing
women,

2097
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:22,970
oh,
this is airplay airplay yet,

2098
01:31:22,971 --> 01:31:24,830
but they're there.
That's what they're spoofing.

2099
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:27,440
Say,
oh,

2100
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:30,480
this is hilarious.
Boom,

2101
01:31:30,481 --> 01:31:32,130
there we go.
To movies were crazy.

2102
01:31:32,131 --> 01:31:34,950
They would just mack,
he punched her and dropped her.

2103
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:36,391
Wow.
Yeah.

2104
01:31:36,391 --> 01:31:37,224
Like backhand in Sean Connery.
Marilyn Sean connery was interviewed by 

2105
01:31:40,981 --> 01:31:43,950
Barbara Walters and he was advocating 
smacking women.

2106
01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:45,330
Yup.
From charms.

2107
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:46,633
Just keep pushing it and they won't let 
it go and you have to give them a smart 

2108
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,313
and she was like,
are you saying that you stretched your 

2109
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,000
truck trucker where I'm trying like the 
bogart line.

2110
01:31:57,001 --> 01:31:57,834
I never met a team that didn't was it 
didn't like a smack in the mouth or a 

2111
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,290
Clo Colt 45 or whatever.
It's a slug from a goal 40

2112
01:32:06,170 --> 01:32:07,003
a woman now,
and then as I remember you said you 

2113
01:32:08,001 --> 01:32:10,880
don't do it with a clenched fist.
It's better to do it with an open hand.

2114
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:12,650
Yeah,
I remember that.

2115
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,470
Yeah.
I'm not going to love that.

2116
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,940
I haven't changed my opinion.
No.

2117
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:20,690
You think it's good to slap a woman?
No,

2118
01:32:20,691 --> 01:32:21,524
I don't think it's good,
but I don't think it's bad that I don't 

2119
01:32:23,541 --> 01:32:24,374
think it's bad.
I think that it depends entirely on the 

2120
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:29,700
circumstances and if it marriage it and 
what would narrate it.

2121
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:31,213
Well,
if you have tried everything else and 

2122
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:40,850
they kind of put it alone,
you don't want to have the last word,

2123
01:32:40,851 --> 01:32:42,710
then you give them the laughing last 
word,

2124
01:32:42,711 --> 01:32:43,544
but they're not happy with the last one.
They want to share it again and and get 

2125
01:32:48,381 --> 01:32:53,381
into a really provocative situation.
Then one and a half million.

2126
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:56,683
Absolutely right.

2127
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:05,820
What year was that?
That looks like maybe eighties I want to

2128
01:33:05,821 --> 01:33:06,654
say it was later than that and I don't 
want to say it was the 90s that's 

2129
01:33:09,721 --> 01:33:11,340
pretty.
That's pretty well.

2130
01:33:11,341 --> 01:33:13,110
You know he's old,
but that's a generation.

2131
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:18,680
Sometimes they won't bother to go,
well it's a Donald Donald Sterling,

2132
01:33:19,591 --> 01:33:21,930
you know,
he's just an old 1987.

2133
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:23,890
Interesting.
Well it's,

2134
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:25,223
it's interesting cause is looking away 
as she says it and then looks at him 

2135
01:33:28,681 --> 01:33:31,230
when she hits him with a question,
like it's a gotcha moment.

2136
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:32,083
Right.
And I haven't transmart preneurial not 

2137
01:33:33,301 --> 01:33:34,081
at all.
He like,

2138
01:33:34,081 --> 01:33:35,820
he like hits her with that like,
whoa.

2139
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,710
So that was like,
there was a lot of,

2140
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:40,290
that was a game too.
That was also,

2141
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:43,950
she provoked him in this way where,
you know,

2142
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:47,940
he's a chauvinist and some of her that 
did that with Mike Tyson,

2143
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,230
with the,
with his wife,

2144
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:51,790
uh,
pet beauty pageant woman,

2145
01:33:51,791 --> 01:33:52,380
I forget her name.

2146
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:55,020
Yeah.
That he used to batter.

2147
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,270
How was the end of their marriage right 
there on the show?

2148
01:33:57,570 --> 01:33:58,160
Well,
it,

2149
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:00,170
it certainly sent him,
well,

2150
01:34:00,171 --> 01:34:01,004
it sent him on a spiraling,
I think they stayed married for quite a 

2151
01:34:02,581 --> 01:34:05,460
while after the show,
but she was on the show.

2152
01:34:05,461 --> 01:34:09,400
Talk about a whole horrific it is to 
live with him and how he's crazy and,

2153
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:13,530
but of course he is.
He's Mike fucking Tyson,

2154
01:34:13,531 --> 01:34:14,364
right?
He's one of the most terrifying combat 

2155
01:34:16,411 --> 01:34:20,310
sport athletes the world's ever known.
His success is,

2156
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:21,783
it's focused entirely on him being 
violent as humanly possible beyond the 

2157
01:34:26,671 --> 01:34:31,671
limitations of other people who are 
professional purveyors of violence.

2158
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,410
Like he's the best at it,
right?

2159
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:35,813
Brand of violence is so much more 
ferocious than any other fucking person 

2160
01:34:39,181 --> 01:34:40,014
who's ever done it before.
He makes all these other professional 

2161
01:34:41,881 --> 01:34:45,000
heavyweight boxers look like pussies.
They see him,

2162
01:34:45,001 --> 01:34:45,834
they practically faint,
throws punches that miss and they fall 

2163
01:34:48,241 --> 01:34:49,170
down.
He said,

2164
01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:51,900
of course,
he's not like,

2165
01:34:51,901 --> 01:34:54,960
what are we doing here?
Why you have this guy on television?

2166
01:34:54,961 --> 01:34:57,980
What kind of a person that you like?
What is what this therapy

2167
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,360
session like?
What,

2168
01:34:59,361 --> 01:35:00,950
what is she doing?
Like the wife,

2169
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:01,920
what is she doing?
You,

2170
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:03,093
are you doing this publicly because you 
believe this is the only way to reach 

2171
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:06,620
him?
Is that the only thing?

2172
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:10,710
There was a minor controversy bit.
This is before the Internet,

2173
01:35:10,711 --> 01:35:11,730
so it didn't go viral.
But,

2174
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:13,003
um,
the La Times had a story about the rams 

2175
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:19,200
defensive line that was called the 
fearsome foursome in the 19,

2176
01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:20,910
late sixties,
early seventies.

2177
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:22,141
And,
uh,

2178
01:35:22,141 --> 01:35:22,974
you know,
Rosie greer was one of them and he was 

2179
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:25,620
just terrifying,
I guess.

2180
01:35:25,621 --> 01:35:29,190
And he was talking about how he would 
head slap the other Lineman,

2181
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:29,641
like,
you know,

2182
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:31,530
the snap and he banned like this,
right?

2183
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:33,480
Then they had an open hole there for the
ears.

2184
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,553
So the air pressure would like break the
guy's eardrum if he did it right and 

2185
01:35:37,591 --> 01:35:38,424
this would throw him off a little bit,
then he could sack the quarterback or 

2186
01:35:40,261 --> 01:35:41,310
whatever.
This was his thing.

2187
01:35:41,730 --> 01:35:43,170
And then he mentioned like in the 
interview,

2188
01:35:43,171 --> 01:35:44,010
and I,
you know,

2189
01:35:44,011 --> 01:35:46,890
I had slapped my,
my girlfriend or my wife or whatever.

2190
01:35:46,891 --> 01:35:47,850
It was like,
what,

2191
01:35:48,030 --> 01:35:49,260
wait,
what you do this to you?

2192
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,030
It was like,
holy moly.

2193
01:35:51,031 --> 01:35:53,240
And it didn't make a big thing,
but it was there in the title.

2194
01:35:53,241 --> 01:35:54,930
I remember reading it thinking,
God Dang,

2195
01:35:54,931 --> 01:35:55,890
she's,
you know,

2196
01:35:55,891 --> 01:35:56,370
if you're,
you know,

2197
01:35:56,370 --> 01:35:59,460
if you're six,
eight and your weight 300 pounds and you

2198
01:35:59,461 --> 01:36:00,600
have a helmet,
that's one thing.

2199
01:36:00,601 --> 01:36:02,730
But if you know a little Bam,

2200
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:03,993
well,
and this was also probably tolerated so 

2201
01:36:06,161 --> 01:36:08,920
much back then that those women didn't 
have any recourse.

2202
01:36:08,921 --> 01:36:11,230
They couldn't go to a tmz or something 
like that.

2203
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:12,113
They couldn't take video and put it on 
their phone and then put it on the 

2204
01:36:15,191 --> 01:36:17,650
Internet and have it go viral.
They were scared.

2205
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:18,573
I mean,
if you've got some six eight 400 pound 

2206
01:36:20,230 --> 01:36:23,740
gigantic dude wants to hit you,
and he also had sex with you,

2207
01:36:23,741 --> 01:36:24,790
like,
fuck,

2208
01:36:24,791 --> 01:36:27,130
how do you get out of that?
It's hard enough to get out of a regular

2209
01:36:27,131 --> 01:36:27,964
relationship,
right?

2210
01:36:27,970 --> 01:36:28,803
Like the poor lady who had to get on 
stage with Anthony Robbins and call her 

2211
01:36:30,701 --> 01:36:31,900
boyfriend.
You know?

2212
01:36:31,901 --> 01:36:32,734
I mean that's rough.
But imagine if her boyfriend is a 

2213
01:36:34,871 --> 01:36:37,240
fucking giant football player who likes 
hitting her.

2214
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:38,260
Right?
And it was,

2215
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:39,123
if it was in the movies like that and 
you have sean connery talking about it 

2216
01:36:41,711 --> 01:36:43,570
on tv,
it becomes accepted.

2217
01:36:43,571 --> 01:36:44,404
Like then we get into this whole 
determinism thing like is that guy 

2218
01:36:46,811 --> 01:36:47,644
beating his wife,
beating his wife because of the culture 

2219
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:51,070
that he lives in?
And is that,

2220
01:36:51,071 --> 01:36:53,860
is it,
I mean is how much is that affecting his

2221
01:36:53,861 --> 01:36:58,260
conscious decisions and does he have the
freewill to escape that influence?

2222
01:36:58,890 --> 01:37:03,390
The way that moral progress of works in 
this regard over long periods of time is

2223
01:37:03,391 --> 01:37:04,224
that it just never enters your mind to 
do it if you never see it or hear about 

2224
01:37:06,721 --> 01:37:07,554
it.
And that reduces the number of people 

2225
01:37:08,971 --> 01:37:09,804
that do it.
So you know in Sean Connery's 

2226
01:37:11,881 --> 01:37:14,010
generation,
you just showed all those movie clips.

2227
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:16,560
That's probably all he saw was yet 
that's what you do.

2228
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:18,013
And it does.
This would never enter my mind to do 

2229
01:37:19,411 --> 01:37:21,130
this.
I mean it doesn't even,

2230
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:23,060
no matter how bad,
but temporarily I'm not going to

2231
01:37:23,230 --> 01:37:25,830
reach out and introduce you to a few 
checks.

2232
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:29,800
The ones that want the last word.
Yeah,

2233
01:37:29,870 --> 01:37:31,440
it's called break up with them.
Sean,

2234
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:33,090
get out of the house,
go drive.

2235
01:37:33,091 --> 01:37:35,640
You've got a porsche.
I'm going to the hill.

2236
01:37:35,790 --> 01:37:37,710
Fuck off.
Just go drive.

2237
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:40,140
You can get a hotel room somewhere dude,
you're super rich.

2238
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:42,480
You know you have to stay with that 
crazy lady.

2239
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:43,763
Well that's the,
that's one of the sort of self 

2240
01:37:45,331 --> 01:37:48,060
controlled techniques,
but count to 10,

2241
01:37:48,061 --> 01:37:50,370
leave the room.
We are in many ways,

2242
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:51,780
um,
sort of a,

2243
01:37:51,781 --> 01:37:53,470
a product of our environment.
The,

2244
01:37:53,550 --> 01:37:56,010
in the way that we imitate our 
atmosphere so

2245
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:59,490
much mean we have patterns of,
of talking,

2246
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:00,503
we,
there's expressions that are like 

2247
01:38:02,191 --> 01:38:07,020
similar or familiar to certain areas.
We have accents that distinguished that.

2248
01:38:07,021 --> 01:38:10,950
We belong in this clan of people that 
live in Boston for instance,

2249
01:38:10,951 --> 01:38:13,290
where I grew up,
there's a Boston accent,

2250
01:38:13,291 --> 01:38:16,260
it's so clear and if you talk to people 
that live there,

2251
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:18,180
they're letting you know that they're 
local.

2252
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:18,880
Like they're,
they're,

2253
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,050
they're like the,
and everybody sort of assimilates with a

2254
01:38:22,051 --> 01:38:24,200
certain way of thinking and a way of 
being.

2255
01:38:24,230 --> 01:38:25,063
And it's super common to,
for people to adopt a predetermined 

2256
01:38:28,921 --> 01:38:29,754
pattern of behavior rather than having 
to think things all the way through for 

2257
01:38:32,521 --> 01:38:33,354
themselves.
So if that predetermined pattern 

2258
01:38:34,561 --> 01:38:36,550
behavior means you girlfriend mouth's 
off,

2259
01:38:36,551 --> 01:38:40,340
you fucking smack her in the head.
They start doing it like it's right.

2260
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:43,590
Whereas today it's thought of as a 
horrific thing to do.

2261
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:48,150
You're,
you're a domestic violence person.

2262
01:38:48,151 --> 01:38:48,721
You,
you,

2263
01:38:48,721 --> 01:38:50,520
you've,
you've hit someone,

2264
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:52,800
you've committed assault,
you know,

2265
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:53,933
all those horrible words and thoughts 
that we have attached to these things 

2266
01:38:56,641 --> 01:38:59,650
that were almost nonexistent back then,
right.

2267
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:02,190
Just a hundred years ago.
Right.

2268
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:03,053
Totally normal.
So this process probably started in the 

2269
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:07,253
late Middle Ages.
There's a book called the civilizing 

2270
01:39:08,191 --> 01:39:09,024
process by Norbert Elliot,
say sociologists that Steve Pinker kind 

2271
01:39:12,121 --> 01:39:14,640
of made prominent in his book,
the better angels of our nature.

2272
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:16,013
Talking about how,
just like books of manners and table 

2273
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:22,410
manners and how you interact with other 
people.

2274
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,570
Nonviolently you know,
don't have a knife,

2275
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,340
don't care your knife with you or you 
know,

2276
01:39:26,341 --> 01:39:29,010
he had a knife to somebody who's 
supposed to hand it with the handle,

2277
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:31,230
you know,
forward and,

2278
01:39:31,231 --> 01:39:33,450
and you know,
don't do certain things that,

2279
01:39:33,451 --> 01:39:35,430
you know,
don't urinate in the hallways,

2280
01:39:35,431 --> 01:39:36,840
don't defecate in the,
you know,

2281
01:39:36,841 --> 01:39:41,841
this just basically these people were 
gross and here's how not to be gross.

2282
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:45,210
Don't act like pig.
Don't act like right.

2283
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:46,463
And in a way it's,
it's training your brain to gain self 

2284
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:50,490
control over your impulses.
Like,

2285
01:39:50,491 --> 01:39:52,770
I'd really just like to take a shit 
right over there.

2286
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:53,670
Well,
don't do it.

2287
01:39:53,730 --> 01:39:55,260
I mean it's not cool.
We don't do that.

2288
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:56,363
Okay,
I won't.

2289
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:59,430
And then then an even never enters your 
mind to do anything like that.

2290
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:04,740
And so the argument is that we've been 
on this 500 year long civilizing process

2291
01:40:04,741 --> 01:40:08,580
of just training people to control their
impulses.

2292
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:12,540
Impulse control is that prefrontal 
cortex keeping a break on the,

2293
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:13,523
you know,
the sort of lower impulses that bubble 

2294
01:40:15,241 --> 01:40:16,770
up.
I'd really like to do that,

2295
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:17,813
not going to do it.
And then pretty soon you don't even 

2296
01:40:18,781 --> 01:40:21,930
think about doing it.
Now obviously there's still a handful of

2297
01:40:21,931 --> 01:40:23,430
the psychopaths or whatever,
they don't care,

2298
01:40:23,431 --> 01:40:27,420
but fewer and fewer of us and just from 
the interview,

2299
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:31,740
so sean connery's generation versus our 
generation versus our kids,

2300
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:33,151
uh,
you know,

2301
01:40:33,151 --> 01:40:36,420
this is just disappearing from our 
vocabulary,

2302
01:40:36,421 --> 01:40:41,310
from our repertoire of behaviors that we
will employ with other people.

2303
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,260
You just don't even think about doing 
that.

2304
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:44,243
That's the,
that's how moral progress happens from 

2305
01:40:45,901 --> 01:40:46,734
the bottom up.
It completely makes sense and it 

2306
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,750
completely makes sense when you look at 
the history of humanity,

2307
01:40:51,751 --> 01:40:54,280
how much safer it is today relatively

2308
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:55,353
than at any other time in terms of like 
how much violence you're going to 

2309
01:40:57,701 --> 01:41:00,850
encounter and you daily life when we see
violence to incredibly shocking.

2310
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,430
Whereas if we lived 5,000
years ago,

2311
01:41:03,431 --> 01:41:06,640
it'd be incredibly rare to get through 
life without seeing dead buys.

2312
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:07,823
Like you,
you became much more custom to the 

2313
01:41:10,001 --> 01:41:10,834
temporary nature of being and the threat
of violence being a real part of 

2314
01:41:13,841 --> 01:41:14,920
everyday life.
Right?

2315
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:15,783
Or is this not anymore?
So I think one of the things that's 

2316
01:41:18,011 --> 01:41:18,844
happening as we create new technology 
that sort of alleviates the physical 

2317
01:41:24,221 --> 01:41:29,221
stress of life or the worry of dying or 
we extend life to the point and fix,

2318
01:41:30,370 --> 01:41:31,203
uh,
illnesses to the point where life 

2319
01:41:32,891 --> 01:41:35,860
becomes a little bit more,
a little bit more durable,

2320
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:39,130
a little and people will relax more and 
more about the fee,

2321
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:44,140
like the physical requirements our 
bodies had a few thousand years ago,

2322
01:41:44,141 --> 01:41:44,974
we were hunters and gatherers.
We're constantly worried about 

2323
01:41:46,631 --> 01:41:48,300
predators.
That physical,

2324
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:49,173
physical requirements and the dangers 
that you had to be able to experience 

2325
01:41:51,911 --> 01:41:56,470
and mitigate and get through every day.
We're so much more,

2326
01:41:56,650 --> 01:42:00,370
so much more dangerous than what we 
experience on a daily basis,

2327
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,590
other than like car accidents and things
along those lines.

2328
01:42:02,591 --> 01:42:03,424
Right?
But we still have all those fight or 

2329
01:42:04,961 --> 01:42:05,794
flight responses.
We still have those reward systems that 

2330
01:42:08,081 --> 01:42:10,360
need to be fed because we're essentially
in the same,

2331
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:12,580
you know,
give or take a few genetic mutations,

2332
01:42:12,581 --> 01:42:15,130
the same bodies that people had 10,000
years ago,

2333
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:15,710
right?

2334
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:17,120
Yup.
Yup.

2335
01:42:17,150 --> 01:42:19,130
It's like that little line.
The three F's,

2336
01:42:19,131 --> 01:42:22,520
fight,
flight or reproduction or threes.

2337
01:42:22,730 --> 01:42:24,110
That's the other one or phrase.
Yeah.

2338
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:27,650
Big One is when people don't consider is
why do people,

2339
01:42:27,651 --> 01:42:30,620
why do certain people not run,
not fight,

2340
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:33,140
but panic lock up.
Right?

2341
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:36,080
What's going on there?
Because that's a real response.

2342
01:42:36,081 --> 01:42:39,110
That is super common.
That doesn't get addressed in that fight

2343
01:42:39,111 --> 01:42:40,050
flight response.
Right?

2344
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:43,640
There's also people that can work,
fucking freeze.

2345
01:42:44,270 --> 01:42:44,920
But all of those

2346
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:46,090
things,
uh,

2347
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:50,110
in a more dangerous world actually do 
age you faster that some of the research

2348
01:42:50,111 --> 01:42:52,690
I was reading these books about aging,
uh,

2349
01:42:52,691 --> 01:42:54,650
is this,
the more stress you have itch it,

2350
01:42:54,651 --> 01:42:55,484
it does.
Those stress hormones leads to more 

2351
01:42:57,221 --> 01:42:58,054
inflammation.
There's more and more stuff about 

2352
01:42:59,681 --> 01:43:02,830
inflammation and disease,
inflammation and Alzheimer's Information

2353
01:43:02,831 --> 01:43:03,664
and the telomeres shortens your life.
And there was this big study on possums 

2354
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:09,003
in Florida,
the ones that are out in the wild 

2355
01:43:10,331 --> 01:43:11,164
getting run over and attacked and preyed
upon versus ones that were put on this 

2356
01:43:14,111 --> 01:43:17,380
island where there was no predators,
all the food that they want.

2357
01:43:17,410 --> 01:43:18,243
And you know,
the ones,

2358
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:21,370
the ones that lived on the island live 
significantly longer but like,

2359
01:43:21,371 --> 01:43:26,371
like 50% longer and not just accounted 
for by the ones that got run over.

2360
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:28,990
Not that just the aging,
the aging president,

2361
01:43:29,230 --> 01:43:33,010
just living in an open dangerous 
environment takes its toll on your cell,

2362
01:43:33,011 --> 01:43:35,350
eular,
reproduction and how long you live,

2363
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:38,110
uh,
irrespective of predation and accidents.

2364
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,090
Um,
so this is back to the,

2365
01:43:40,091 --> 01:43:41,320
you know,
meditation take,

2366
01:43:41,321 --> 01:43:42,131
you know,
take it easy,

2367
01:43:42,131 --> 01:43:46,360
lower those stress hormones because they
do take a toll on your body.

2368
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:48,050
Yeah,
unquestionably.

2369
01:43:48,051 --> 01:43:50,450
I mean it must the,
the,

2370
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:52,070
the idea that you could

2371
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,820
get through life red lining it all the 
time and not have,

2372
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:55,793
yeah.
It's just like people ask that don't 

2373
01:43:56,601 --> 01:43:58,610
know much about football.
Why can't they play the whole game?

2374
01:43:58,611 --> 01:44:00,230
Like the final two minutes?
Jesus.

2375
01:44:00,231 --> 01:44:01,100
Well,
you can't do it.

2376
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:02,433
Yeah.
I mean it's just football in and of 

2377
01:44:04,551 --> 01:44:07,700
itself.
Like how long can you do that?

2378
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:08,893
Like does anybody ever figured out how 
many times you can get hit by a guy 

2379
01:44:11,001 --> 01:44:14,390
who's 350 lbs running 30 miles an hour.
I mean,

2380
01:44:14,391 --> 01:44:15,224
those guys are giant and they're huge 
super athletes and they collide with 

2381
01:44:17,481 --> 01:44:18,314
each other.
I don't think a person like you or me 

2382
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:21,463
could even appreciate the amount of 
impact that's involved in a lineman who 

2383
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:31,280
was just a giant mountain of a man using
all of his might and running into you.

2384
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:36,060
I don't think I can understand it.
I think I like watch it on TV and I see,

2385
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:36,894
boom,
what guy's feet are up in the air and 

2386
01:44:38,241 --> 01:44:39,074
they'd go slam.

2387
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:43,070
But I don't think,
I don't think I physically can feel it.

2388
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:45,200
I don't think,
I don't think I get it right.

2389
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:48,080
I just think it's no,
that story of the,

2390
01:44:48,081 --> 01:44:48,561
uh,
you know,

2391
01:44:48,561 --> 01:44:50,510
how could the concussion story,
uh,

2392
01:44:50,511 --> 01:44:51,344
that was first broke by espn and a duck 
or a frontline in a two hour 

2393
01:44:53,811 --> 01:44:55,490
documentary,
uh,

2394
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:57,800
that guy that died,
the Pittsburgh steelers center,

2395
01:44:57,801 --> 01:44:59,170
Mike,
uh,

2396
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:00,740
what was the guy,
I forget his name.

2397
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:04,970
Jamie's a big sports fan.
Like he was featured in the movie that,

2398
01:45:04,971 --> 01:45:06,650
uh,
the Wilson Smith movie.

2399
01:45:06,651 --> 01:45:07,700
Yeah.
But,

2400
01:45:07,970 --> 01:45:08,803
but the,
the docs calculated that in the course 

2401
01:45:10,701 --> 01:45:12,860
of his life,
say from high school football,

2402
01:45:12,861 --> 01:45:13,694
College football,
and 20 seasons of the NFL and all the 

2403
01:45:17,121 --> 01:45:19,520
practices all week,
and then the game,

2404
01:45:19,521 --> 01:45:20,300
you know,
and he webster,

2405
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:20,951
yeah.
Mike Webster,

2406
01:45:20,951 --> 01:45:21,784
you probably got hit.
It hit the equivalent of a minor 

2407
01:45:23,961 --> 01:45:24,890
concussion,
you know,

2408
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,980
thousands,
maybe tens of thousands of times.

2409
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:28,670
And that,
you know,

2410
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:31,930
that's the cumulative effects.
Um,

2411
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:34,280
are you so crazy?
What is this?

2412
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:37,940
What does this change?
And I felt like God,

2413
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:39,283
okay.
So in 1927 they were 190 pounds and six 

2414
01:45:44,001 --> 01:45:44,834
feet tall.
So a 190 pounds is six pounds less than 

2415
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:50,760
me.
And I'm,

2416
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:53,900
I'm not a big person.
I'm five foot eight.

2417
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:56,870
So they're a little taller at six foot 
for the average lyman,

2418
01:45:56,871 --> 01:46:01,871
which is a giant person right now in 
2000 and what is the last one?

2419
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:03,410
Eight Jamie,
what does it say?

2420
01:46:03,411 --> 01:46:05,750
Scroll down.
I'll share this part at the bottom,

2421
01:46:05,751 --> 01:46:10,340
which just how hard is there hit star.
But 2006 you get to the average lyman is

2422
01:46:10,341 --> 01:46:15,341
six foot four 335 he's not the average.
He's the outlier though.

2423
01:46:15,981 --> 01:46:17,150
Cause he said hello.
He nodded.

2424
01:46:17,151 --> 01:46:17,984
He,
he's a,

2425
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:18,943
he's a little bit big,
but still you can see are a little bit 

2426
01:46:20,991 --> 01:46:23,300
smaller than him,
but still they're all over 300 pounds.

2427
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:24,980
If I look at it,
I mean I remember Alan Page,

2428
01:46:24,981 --> 01:46:25,814
he was huge.
He was massive and it just one of the 

2429
01:46:27,771 --> 01:46:31,040
great and he only two 45 you probably 
wouldn't even make the,

2430
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:32,650
the uh,
the,

2431
01:46:32,850 --> 01:46:34,580
the main team now.
Right.

2432
01:46:34,581 --> 01:46:36,160
And what year was that?
Scroll down please.

2433
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:38,660
67 so in 67.
Yeah.

2434
01:46:38,661 --> 01:46:40,010
67.
That guy was like,

2435
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:41,053
like if you see like how big George 
Foreman was right when George Foreman 

2436
01:46:43,731 --> 01:46:45,830
was the heavyweight champ.
He was gigantic.

2437
01:46:45,831 --> 01:46:48,500
But I don't,
I mean when he came back,

2438
01:46:48,501 --> 01:46:50,100
when he started comeback,
he was well over

2439
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:50,933
300 pounds and he was really overweight.
But I don't think he was that big when 

2440
01:46:53,611 --> 01:46:54,444
he was fighting.
I think he was in the two twenties to 

2441
01:46:55,981 --> 01:46:57,870
thirties when he was a heavyweight 
champion.

2442
01:46:57,871 --> 01:47:00,930
I'll beat him some of this stuff,
like the ones on the right there,

2443
01:47:00,931 --> 01:47:02,400
there's a lot of body fat that's,
no,

2444
01:47:02,401 --> 01:47:03,620
of course not.
Yeah.

2445
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:04,713
Yeah.
I mean there's more mass like the sumo 

2446
01:47:06,601 --> 01:47:07,830
wrestlers.
You want mass,

2447
01:47:07,831 --> 01:47:08,830
not just muscle.
Yeah.

2448
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,590
You know,
they also,

2449
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:11,483
those guys are just all about power.
They're all about power and weight 

2450
01:47:14,821 --> 01:47:16,620
behind power.
And there are certain amount of time,

2451
01:47:16,621 --> 01:47:20,610
like if you have the same amount of 
power but more weight behind it,

2452
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:21,533
you can actually probably have more of 
an impact when you're colliding with 

2453
01:47:23,821 --> 01:47:24,654
people.
Right?

2454
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:26,760
Like if you ever tried to wrestle with a
big person,

2455
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:30,180
like even if they're not strong,
like the amount of mass that you have to

2456
01:47:30,181 --> 01:47:32,040
move when you're wrestling around with 
them.

2457
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:35,070
Like right.
You don't consider it until someone,

2458
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:38,370
like,
until you're in a situation like I guess

2459
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:39,533
if you had never played football before 
and then you ran out there and you were 

2460
01:47:41,761 --> 01:47:43,920
on the front line and you'd be like,
okay,

2461
01:47:43,921 --> 01:47:46,030
what does this going to be like?
No,

2462
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:47,400
there's no way.
You know what,

2463
01:47:47,401 --> 01:47:49,810
that 330 pound dude feels like.
Well,

2464
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:54,330
he's right.
Full blast into you,

2465
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:56,580
but crazy fucking sport.

2466
01:47:56,660 --> 01:47:57,493
Yeah.
I'm reading this book now called 

2467
01:47:57,951 --> 01:47:59,810
spitting in the soup,
um,

2468
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:00,673
about the history of doping in sports.
That goes back to the late 19th century 

2469
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:07,310
and half of it is just for survival.
Uh,

2470
01:48:07,311 --> 01:48:09,320
you know,
you take these drugs just to get through

2471
01:48:09,321 --> 01:48:11,960
the next week and the next game,
the next contest.

2472
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:13,820
Um,
and then,

2473
01:48:13,821 --> 01:48:16,900
and how it was this guy's argument is 
that it was pretty accepted,

2474
01:48:16,910 --> 01:48:18,260
common and known.
Uh,

2475
01:48:18,470 --> 01:48:20,570
the guy that won the Tour de France five
times,

2476
01:48:20,571 --> 01:48:22,370
um,
uh,

2477
01:48:22,371 --> 01:48:23,204
used to say that you,
you can't expect us to do this on bread 

2478
01:48:25,241 --> 01:48:26,180
and water.
I mean,

2479
01:48:26,181 --> 01:48:29,220
you know,
we raised 250 times a year and you know,

2480
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:31,850
six,
eight hours a day of killing ourselves.

2481
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:33,870
Sean Cockatiel,
the French great friends,

2482
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:34,773
cyclists.
But this appears to be true in most 

2483
01:48:36,021 --> 01:48:39,230
sports.
And that it wasn't until the,

2484
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:44,430
that I think it was 1906 Olympics when 
people started equating doping with sin.

2485
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:47,960
Like this is a moral thing.
Like you're getting,

2486
01:48:47,961 --> 01:48:51,110
you're cheating as opposed to,
it's just a medical thing.

2487
01:48:51,111 --> 01:48:51,770
You know,
I,

2488
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:52,910
I train,
I lift weights,

2489
01:48:52,911 --> 01:48:54,380
I do this,
I eat this diet,

2490
01:48:54,381 --> 01:48:55,214
I take these drugs.
It's all kind of part of the mix of 

2491
01:48:56,901 --> 01:48:59,360
being an athlete.
And then there was a transition.

2492
01:48:59,361 --> 01:49:02,150
He argues socially or morally or 
whatever.

2493
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:04,480
And all these things are good,
but this,

2494
01:49:04,481 --> 01:49:06,470
this one thing over here is bad,
like say,

2495
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:11,330
and cycling your Hematocrit is important
because you're delivering oxygen to your

2496
01:49:11,331 --> 01:49:12,230
muscles.
So,

2497
01:49:12,710 --> 01:49:13,820
uh,
if you know,

2498
01:49:13,821 --> 01:49:14,654
you and I probably have 45 to 50% 
hermatocrit that's the number of red 

2499
01:49:17,691 --> 01:49:18,524
blood cells in your blood.
So half are red blood cells delivering 

2500
01:49:21,231 --> 01:49:22,640
oxygen to your muscles.
So,

2501
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:25,160
uh,
now if you're like in the low thirties,

2502
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:27,890
that's anemic.
And this drug epo,

2503
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:28,833
uh,
invented by Amgen was created to save 

2504
01:49:31,131 --> 01:49:33,410
patients that are anemic from cancer 
treatment or whatever.

2505
01:49:33,410 --> 01:49:36,910
It's a great drug,
but so it wasn't long before the cyclist

2506
01:49:36,911 --> 01:49:38,900
got ahold of this in the late eighties,
early nineties.

2507
01:49:38,901 --> 01:49:39,231
Like,
well,

2508
01:49:39,231 --> 01:49:40,550
okay,
if 45%,

2509
01:49:40,551 --> 01:49:43,760
if I'm naturally a 45% and you're at 
50%,

2510
01:49:44,030 --> 01:49:45,500
I'm losing a little edge.
So I'll just,

2511
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:46,873
I'll train at high altitude,
I'll sleep in the oxygen tent or I'll 

2512
01:49:49,241 --> 01:49:52,750
just take the injection.
And so 50% is good.

2513
01:49:52,751 --> 01:49:54,070
How about 55%?
Well,

2514
01:49:54,071 --> 01:49:57,670
that'd be even better.
How about 60% and the guy who won the 96

2515
01:49:58,030 --> 01:49:58,863
tour bjarney reese,
he was nicknamed was Mr 60% and he's 

2516
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:04,570
like mud flows.
And also then,

2517
01:50:04,630 --> 01:50:05,950
but then,
uh,

2518
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:09,340
some cyclists started dying in the early
nineties and mid nineties.

2519
01:50:09,341 --> 01:50:13,930
There was maybe a dozen or two that died
mysteriously and it was never clear what

2520
01:50:13,931 --> 01:50:14,764
the cause was.
So everybody said it's the epo they 

2521
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:17,650
take,
you know,

2522
01:50:17,650 --> 01:50:18,483
the blood is too thick there.
It's having strokes or heart attacks 

2523
01:50:20,261 --> 01:50:22,510
and,
and even I bought this idea.

2524
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:23,321
Yeah,
I guess that's it.

2525
01:50:23,321 --> 01:50:25,760
I wrote this article for Scientific 
American about doping in sports.

2526
01:50:25,761 --> 01:50:28,150
So this is why it's wrong because people
are dying.

2527
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,990
But this guy's argument is,
is it was never proven that these people

2528
01:50:31,991 --> 01:50:32,890
died.
And furthermore,

2529
01:50:32,891 --> 01:50:34,300
he takes on steroids.
You know,

2530
01:50:34,301 --> 01:50:36,700
this is the whole thing that started 
with lyall Elsedo,

2531
01:50:36,701 --> 01:50:40,690
the Oakland Raiders linebacker who said,
you know,

2532
01:50:40,691 --> 01:50:43,240
I got brain cancer is after he was done 
playing,

2533
01:50:43,241 --> 01:50:44,280
but he said it was,
it was dude,

2534
01:50:44,290 --> 01:50:46,870
all the steroids I was taking.
Then the meme started,

2535
01:50:46,871 --> 01:50:48,340
oh,
steroids causes cancer,

2536
01:50:48,490 --> 01:50:49,780
steroids feeds,
cancer,

2537
01:50:49,781 --> 01:50:50,614
causes tumors to grow.
This guy is saying that's never been 

2538
01:50:52,901 --> 01:50:54,940
proven.
And so I'm,

2539
01:50:55,270 --> 01:50:57,550
I'd like to look into this more before 
and review this book.

2540
01:50:57,551 --> 01:50:58,780
You know,
is this really true?

2541
01:50:58,781 --> 01:51:01,630
How do we know that steroids are 
dangerous?

2542
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:03,220
I mean,
isn't it the dosage?

2543
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:06,340
You know,
it's mckelly Ferrari said Lance's doping

2544
01:51:06,341 --> 01:51:07,310
doctor,
um,

2545
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:07,790
you know,
it's,

2546
01:51:07,790 --> 01:51:08,623
it's the orange juice.
If you drink too much orange juice is 

2547
01:51:10,361 --> 01:51:11,650
dangerous.
It's the dose,

2548
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:13,570
you know,
so some steroids,

2549
01:51:13,571 --> 01:51:15,580
I'm epo some growth hormone,
you know,

2550
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:18,160
I mean,
some of this should be maintenance.

2551
01:51:18,190 --> 01:51:21,220
Like what triggered this was looking at 
those huge guys.

2552
01:51:21,221 --> 01:51:22,390
I mean,
you get pounded,

2553
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:24,760
you got to play again next week.
How do you do that?

2554
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,460
Well,
I gotta I gotta take that,

2555
01:51:26,510 --> 01:51:28,660
get the massage,
take the Jacuzzi,

2556
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:30,730
you know,
and take some drugs.

2557
01:51:31,370 --> 01:51:32,840
That was the premise of bigger,
stronger,

2558
01:51:32,841 --> 01:51:33,651
faster.
Oh,

2559
01:51:33,651 --> 01:51:35,240
right.
It was a big thing.

2560
01:51:35,241 --> 01:51:36,800
Was that,
where are all the bodies?

2561
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,570
Like where,
where is this,

2562
01:51:38,571 --> 01:51:40,970
this steroid epidemic that people are 
talking about?

2563
01:51:40,971 --> 01:51:44,270
What you've looking at even at,
in bodybuilders.

2564
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:46,700
I mean,
some of them do die from it,

2565
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:47,563
but the sheer amount of drugs those guys
are taking to achieve those behemoth 

2566
01:51:53,871 --> 01:51:54,910
sizes.
Yeah,

2567
01:51:55,050 --> 01:51:58,850
I give you look at some pro body have 
just outlandishly huge.

2568
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:00,133
A lot of those guys,
it's a battle of who can take the most 

2569
01:52:02,331 --> 01:52:04,880
drugs,
who could power lift the most?

2570
01:52:04,881 --> 01:52:07,280
We can lift the most.
We could train the hardest,

2571
01:52:07,281 --> 01:52:12,230
but also who can tolerate the most 
ridiculous levels of these drugs.

2572
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:14,570
And so some of those guys die.
Right?

2573
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:17,210
But well there's the dosage is yes,
exactly.

2574
01:52:17,211 --> 01:52:20,840
Because the amount of people that are 
doing them is off the charts.

2575
01:52:21,050 --> 01:52:22,640
If you think about professional 
athletes,

2576
01:52:22,641 --> 01:52:23,474
you think about all the different 
athletes that are doing performance 

2577
01:52:25,041 --> 01:52:25,874
enhancing drugs.
If they were really dying from this 

2578
01:52:27,381 --> 01:52:29,270
stuff,
it to body should be everywhere,

2579
01:52:29,271 --> 01:52:31,520
everywhere.
It should be just dropping like flies,

2580
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:31,730
I

2581
01:52:31,730 --> 01:52:32,563
think.
I think they're just getting smarter 

2582
01:52:33,231 --> 01:52:35,660
about it and they know it's called 
microdosing.

2583
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:37,880
In cycling with the EPA,
you just take a little bit,

2584
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:40,430
just give it just a little bump just for
maintenance,

2585
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:41,653
you know?
And I wrote that story for scientific 

2586
01:52:42,801 --> 01:52:43,910
American.
I interview George,

2587
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:45,800
um,
um,

2588
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:48,170
Frankie Andrea,
who was one of lance his teammates,

2589
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:52,070
uh,
in the 99 and 2000 seasons that he won.

2590
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:53,593
And he took epo and he didn't,
didn't really want to avoid it as long 

2591
01:52:57,711 --> 01:52:58,544
as he could,
but he said he was just getting dropped 

2592
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:01,693
from the main Peloton and he couldn't 
even do his job is just the lances 

2593
01:53:04,881 --> 01:53:06,650
domestique to carry his water bottles 
up.

2594
01:53:06,651 --> 01:53:07,220
You know,
you're,

2595
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:10,130
you're up there in the front with Lance,
dropped back to the team car,

2596
01:53:10,131 --> 01:53:12,650
get some water bottles,
then you've got to ride all the way back

2597
01:53:12,651 --> 01:53:13,484
up to the front,
which is hard to do when these guys are 

2598
01:53:14,571 --> 01:53:16,650
cruising along at 30 miles an hour.
Yeah.

2599
01:53:16,730 --> 01:53:17,563
So you've got to be fit.
So he said he was getting dropped just 

2600
01:53:19,611 --> 01:53:21,560
doing that.
So it was like,

2601
01:53:21,561 --> 01:53:23,030
I can't,
I can't even be on the team,

2602
01:53:23,031 --> 01:53:25,250
can't do my job.
So he took it just to,

2603
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:28,430
just to stay in the race,
just so I could be a bicyclist.

2604
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:30,980
Just say to deliver water.
Yeah.

2605
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:33,260
And a,
I think a lot of them do that.

2606
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,640
You know,
it's like I don't want to do it,

2607
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:38,060
but you know it got to do it cause stay 
healthy and strong and keep going.

2608
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:41,420
Well you'd have a unique insight into it
because you did a lot of cycling.

2609
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:42,313
Yeah.
And you did it at a very high and 

2610
01:53:43,251 --> 01:53:47,750
competitive level so you had an inside 
view as to the requirements.

2611
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:48,613
And I think it's one of the more,
more unique sports in that the 

2612
01:53:51,561 --> 01:53:52,394
requirements are so incredibly grueling 
and the amount of time that you're 

2613
01:53:55,521 --> 01:53:56,354
working,
like you might not be working with as 

2614
01:53:58,281 --> 01:53:59,114
much effort,
say as a sprinter whose running 100 

2615
01:54:01,671 --> 01:54:02,504
meter like a Usain bolt tight character.
But the amount of time involved in 

2616
01:54:06,621 --> 01:54:07,454
expenditure of energy is huge.
It's one of the more unique and weird 

2617
01:54:11,091 --> 01:54:13,960
things about cycling is you're doing it 
for an hour.

2618
01:54:14,810 --> 01:54:16,760
Like what is one day in the Tour de 
France?

2619
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:19,130
Notice how I said France,
France.

2620
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:21,360
Oh there,
there was a,

2621
01:54:21,361 --> 01:54:22,880
you know,
usually four to six hours,

2622
01:54:22,881 --> 01:54:27,881
four to six hours of pumping your legs.
She,

2623
01:54:28,350 --> 01:54:30,710
it was six hours.
That's crazy.

2624
01:54:30,711 --> 01:54:31,544
When you think about it.
So even if it's easier than running a 

2625
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:34,874
sprint,
even if it's easier than running up to 

2626
01:54:36,171 --> 01:54:39,740
the top of a hill,
the amount of time you're spending doing

2627
01:54:39,741 --> 01:54:40,574
it is another consideration.
And then mentally the drag on maintain 

2628
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:46,460
it was,
must be huge.

2629
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:47,303
Must be crazy.

2630
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:49,370
Well,
this is when I interviewed Greg Lamond.

2631
01:54:49,390 --> 01:54:52,810
Uh,
he said that his teammates came to him,

2632
01:54:52,811 --> 01:54:56,140
this was in the 91 or 92 season in his 
last,

2633
01:54:56,950 --> 01:54:59,590
and when epo was,
was rampid in the Peloton,

2634
01:54:59,591 --> 01:55:01,630
everyone figured it out.
Greg didn't want to do that,

2635
01:55:01,810 --> 01:55:04,210
do it.
And his teammates are saying,

2636
01:55:04,211 --> 01:55:05,080
well we,
you know,

2637
01:55:05,081 --> 01:55:08,440
just the course of a three week tour,
you know,

2638
01:55:08,441 --> 01:55:11,050
just your medica just drops just from 
fatigue.

2639
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:12,213
He said everybody else,
it's not like they're getting an unfair 

2640
01:55:13,541 --> 01:55:17,080
advantage by going above their normal,
they're just staying level.

2641
01:55:17,081 --> 01:55:17,914
Whereas the rest of us are dropping off.
And then the last few stages you're 

2642
01:55:20,831 --> 01:55:21,750
wiped out.
Right.

2643
01:55:21,751 --> 01:55:22,511
So,
you know,

2644
01:55:22,511 --> 01:55:25,420
it's like we got to do this just to stay
with the rest of the field.

2645
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:28,270
So the level playing field argument I 
guess,

2646
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:29,650
you know,
in terms of morals,

2647
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:30,573
we sort of draw the line at the needle 
when there's a needle involved I guess 

2648
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,350
or you know,
a patch or a pill,

2649
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:40,300
it feels different than training at high
altitude or sleeping in the oxygen tent.

2650
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:41,201
Um,
you know,

2651
01:55:41,201 --> 01:55:43,710
like the climbers to uh,
you know,

2652
01:55:43,711 --> 01:55:46,380
taking epl feels like it's more 
artificial.

2653
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:50,370
This guy's argument of this book 
spitting in the soup is that it's just a

2654
01:55:50,371 --> 01:55:54,570
great Asian and we've just arbitrarily 
drawn the line there and uh,

2655
01:55:54,630 --> 01:55:55,463
you know,
I think there's much of it in the NFL 

2656
01:55:57,721 --> 01:55:58,554
has got it just be getting to the end of
the season and still being able to play 

2657
01:56:01,861 --> 01:56:02,970
just because it's so hard.

2658
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:06,500
Well I think that argument is very good 
because there's certain supplements that

2659
01:56:06,501 --> 01:56:08,730
you can take through effective that 
actually do work.

2660
01:56:08,731 --> 01:56:10,650
So how do we to stay and what was your 
staff that,

2661
01:56:10,651 --> 01:56:12,690
um,
that the baseball players,

2662
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:14,830
uh,
andrew now understand on,

2663
01:56:15,170 --> 01:56:18,690
but they will most likely it is that 
most likely bullshit.

2664
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:21,570
Most likely there was an excuse for them
doing actual steroids.

2665
01:56:21,790 --> 01:56:23,610
Right?
Cause I think that Mark McGuire,

2666
01:56:23,611 --> 01:56:26,460
yes,
I think that some forms of that stuff,

2667
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:31,650
some forms of those,
what they call pro hormones can actually

2668
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:32,484
trigger positive test results in maybe 
primitive like back then when they were 

2669
01:56:37,651 --> 01:56:38,484
testing people,
which is like nothing compared to what 

2670
01:56:39,961 --> 01:56:40,794
they're doing now,
which is why really interestingly two 

2671
01:56:42,721 --> 01:56:43,554
Russian Olympic wrestlers have been 
stripped of their gold metals because 

2672
01:56:47,641 --> 01:56:48,750
uh,
of the past,

2673
01:56:48,751 --> 01:56:49,584
I think from 2008 they didn't even get 
the 2012 results in because they took 

2674
01:56:53,701 --> 01:56:55,770
their samples that they had back then.

2675
01:56:55,770 --> 01:56:58,800
And now with newer,
more sophisticated levels of testing,

2676
01:56:58,801 --> 01:57:00,840
they've been able to show that these 
guys were doing some shit.

2677
01:57:01,410 --> 01:57:02,243
But the UFC is a,
an interesting proving ground for it 

2678
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:06,210
because,
uh,

2679
01:57:06,210 --> 01:57:07,043
Jeff Novitsky who was the head of Usada 
and the drug program that got Lance 

2680
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:13,163
Armstrong and a bunch of other people 
Novitsky now works for the UFC and he 

2681
01:57:17,431 --> 01:57:18,390
is,
oh yes.

2682
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:19,283
Oh yes.
And he has for quite a while now and he 

2683
01:57:20,641 --> 01:57:21,474
has almost completely cleaned up the 
amount of people that are doing things 

2684
01:57:27,181 --> 01:57:29,400
that people still get caught every now 
and then.

2685
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:33,810
But the amount of people that who were 
their physiques have changed where their

2686
01:57:33,811 --> 01:57:34,644
performance has changed.
Where there results inside the octagon 

2687
01:57:37,651 --> 01:57:40,980
of like drastically dropped off is 
pretty obvious.

2688
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:41,863
Insignificant to the point where MMA 
fans and you know the pundits and 

2689
01:57:45,031 --> 01:57:46,650
analysts are looking at this and they're
going,

2690
01:57:46,651 --> 01:57:48,900
wow,
this is fascinating.

2691
01:57:49,050 --> 01:57:51,120
Like you're,
you're seeing people change.

2692
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:56,220
Like there's even a term that we use an 
MMA like pre Usada like we use pre Usada

2693
01:57:56,221 --> 01:57:59,610
and post Usada like they got him off the
drugs are the fight still is good,

2694
01:57:59,611 --> 01:58:00,660
exciting to watch.
Well,

2695
01:58:00,661 --> 01:58:02,490
the best guys for sure.
Yeah,

2696
01:58:02,491 --> 01:58:06,870
the best guys are still the best guys.
But there's some guys that were the best

2697
01:58:06,871 --> 01:58:07,704
guys that were on legal stuff like they 
used to have allow testosterone 

2698
01:58:10,741 --> 01:58:12,870
replacement therapy.
It used to be legal,

2699
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:16,320
so all you had to do was take steroids,
go to your doctor,

2700
01:58:16,321 --> 01:58:18,870
get off the steroids,
testosterone crashes,

2701
01:58:18,871 --> 01:58:20,040
you go to the doctors,
Hey dog,

2702
01:58:20,041 --> 01:58:20,370
man,
I got,

2703
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:22,290
I think I got low test.
You know what son?

2704
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:23,153
You have a condition,
it's called low testosterone and they 

2705
01:58:25,801 --> 01:58:27,690
would prescribe it for you.
The same way,

2706
01:58:27,691 --> 01:58:30,210
like when you were talking about 
alcohols and being a disease,

2707
01:58:30,211 --> 01:58:31,044
they would just decided that 
testosterone loss as a disease and this 

2708
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:35,850
man needs his medicine.

2709
01:58:36,090 --> 01:58:39,780
And so they would give these guys 
testosterone in like 35 36 year old guys

2710
01:58:39,781 --> 01:58:43,210
would be just jacked,
jacked and fighting.

2711
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:44,283
Not just jacked and going to the beach,
but like involved in a sport where your 

2712
01:58:49,150 --> 01:58:52,300
whole purpose is to do physical harm to 
your opponent,

2713
01:58:52,350 --> 01:58:53,183
right?
So this drug allows you to do are more 

2714
01:58:54,971 --> 01:58:57,670
physical harm,
which is very different than cycling.

2715
01:58:57,940 --> 01:58:58,773
Like if a guy gets really good at 
cycling and he has to use drugs to get 

2716
01:59:01,451 --> 01:59:03,730
really good at cycling and he's cheating
to win,

2717
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:04,773
that's one thing.
But if he's doing these drugs and it's 

2718
01:59:06,551 --> 01:59:08,650
allowing him to put other people in the 
hospital,

2719
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,780
things get very weird.
Well,

2720
01:59:10,781 --> 01:59:12,340
in terms of the moral argument,
um,

2721
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:15,010
if you're saying that the fights are,
are just as fun to watch,

2722
01:59:15,011 --> 01:59:15,844
they're exciting,
competitive without the drugs and fewer 

2723
01:59:18,281 --> 01:59:21,550
people are harmed from taking the drugs,
then maybe that's a good thing.

2724
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:22,383
That would be argument for Usada.
The argument can even be said that the 

2725
01:59:25,241 --> 01:59:28,330
fights are more exciting because people 
are more vulnerable.

2726
01:59:28,810 --> 01:59:29,643
They get knocked out easier,
they get tired easier and sometimes it 

2727
01:59:31,811 --> 01:59:33,490
makes fights crazier.
Okay,

2728
01:59:33,491 --> 01:59:34,324
let's cut.
Guys have tested positive for epo after 

2729
01:59:36,521 --> 01:59:37,354
even championship level fights.
There was this guy I'll bag routine off 

2730
01:59:39,911 --> 01:59:40,744
who's a top flyweight fighter and 
interesting enough he fought a guy who 

2731
01:59:44,141 --> 01:59:44,974
doesn't dope,
who's the best pound for pound fighter 

2732
01:59:46,541 --> 01:59:47,374
in the world is Guy Demetrius mighty 
mouse Johnson and the mighty mouse beat 

2733
01:59:50,411 --> 01:59:51,244
him.
One of the ways he beat him is with 

2734
01:59:52,361 --> 01:59:53,194
volume and pace.
Like this guy couldn't keep up his pace 

2735
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:57,033
because it's right.
Efficiency of technique is also like 

2736
01:59:59,291 --> 02:00:02,890
really critical in mma because the guy 
who doesn't have efficiency and puts too

2737
02:00:02,891 --> 02:00:05,560
much kinetic energy and muscle behind 
techniques,

2738
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:06,970
they tend to fade quicker.

2739
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,330
It can have positive results if you 
catch someone with a shot.

2740
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:11,950
But if you don't over the long period of
time,

2741
02:00:11,951 --> 02:00:12,784
you're draining your gas tank to get a 
single and a single ballot in a single 

2742
02:00:15,581 --> 02:00:18,610
bound.
So this efficiency overcame the drugs.

2743
02:00:18,660 --> 02:00:19,493
The other guy was on like his,
his physical efficiency in this 

2744
02:00:21,251 --> 02:00:22,084
technique.
So the problem is starting and stopping 

2745
02:00:23,561 --> 02:00:24,900
the arms race,
right?

2746
02:00:24,990 --> 02:00:25,721
Bodybuilding,
arms,

2747
02:00:25,721 --> 02:00:26,554
race,
the moment somebody could get away with 

2748
02:00:28,511 --> 02:00:29,344
it,
then everybody thinks that it's being 

2749
02:00:30,371 --> 02:00:31,420
done,
then they have to do it.

2750
02:00:31,870 --> 02:00:34,150
Then you have this behavioral game 
theory thing of the,

2751
02:00:34,151 --> 02:00:37,540
of an arms race.
So Novitsky his point I guess is we were

2752
02:00:37,541 --> 02:00:38,374
going to nip it in the bud.
No one's gonna do it and we're going to 

2753
02:00:39,791 --> 02:00:40,910
make the consequences,
you know,

2754
02:00:40,911 --> 02:00:42,900
super harsh suspensions.
What are the,

2755
02:00:43,030 --> 02:00:43,863
what is it like a two year suspension if
you get caught and a bunch of people 

2756
02:00:47,201 --> 02:00:48,340
have gotten that two years.

2757
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:49,173
And also you have to let you saw to know
where you are every minute of every day 

2758
02:00:53,530 --> 02:00:55,300
I'm testing,
I'm going fishing,

2759
02:00:55,330 --> 02:00:57,130
I'm going to be on Lake Mead.
You know,

2760
02:00:57,131 --> 02:00:58,330
if you want to find me,
that's where I am.

2761
02:00:58,331 --> 02:01:00,280
And then you might get a text while 
you're on Lake Mead,

2762
02:01:00,281 --> 02:01:01,114
come to the dock.
You got to go to the doc and there's a 

2763
02:01:02,291 --> 02:01:03,970
guy standing there and he's going to 
take your blood.

2764
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,833
Right.
I had child son and on the podcast and 

2765
02:01:06,191 --> 02:01:08,650
he was talking about how invasive it was
and how crazy it is.

2766
02:01:08,651 --> 02:01:11,020
They just show up wherever you are.
And he was doing,

2767
02:01:11,021 --> 02:01:13,030
they were,
they were doing it in like a closet with

2768
02:01:13,031 --> 02:01:14,290
like a mop and everything.
He's like,

2769
02:01:14,291 --> 02:01:15,124
this is not a sanitary,
you taking my blood in this weird 

2770
02:01:17,321 --> 02:01:20,250
environment like this is,
this is kind of fucked up there.

2771
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:23,320
They're just trying to catch people.
Well,

2772
02:01:23,321 --> 02:01:25,900
that'll be interesting to see what 
happens with these leaks that are coming

2773
02:01:25,901 --> 02:01:26,321
out.
Uh,

2774
02:01:26,321 --> 02:01:31,321
yesterday that the Russians hacked the 
Usada database.

2775
02:01:32,850 --> 02:01:33,683
They had a,
the William Sisters and the gymnast 

2776
02:01:37,981 --> 02:01:39,830
Biles,
Simone Biles,

2777
02:01:39,860 --> 02:01:40,693
and

2778
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:42,710
you know,
they're threatening to release more,

2779
02:01:42,820 --> 02:01:43,241
uh,
in the,

2780
02:01:43,241 --> 02:01:46,150
in the coming days.
And they were on all kinds of,

2781
02:01:46,151 --> 02:01:47,480
like,
they didn't say what they were on,

2782
02:01:47,481 --> 02:01:50,020
but that they had medical exemption.
Well,

2783
02:01:50,021 --> 02:01:54,050
one of them was oxycodone.
One of the William Sisters was on,

2784
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:55,153
she was on oxygen.
So miles is taking that I think Rydell 

2785
02:01:56,931 --> 02:01:57,764
and medication for Adhd.
And she came out I think today and made 

2786
02:02:00,261 --> 02:02:02,000
a statement about it.
Oh really?

2787
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:03,650
Hmm.
Yeah.

2788
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:04,633
Well that's a readily,
isn't really real in a form of 

2789
02:02:06,630 --> 02:02:07,463
[inaudible] is in a form of like an 
amphetamine or should it be to 

2790
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:12,113
stimulant?
Why would think that a stimulant would 

2791
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:16,640
be a performance enhancing drug?
Why would they let you do?

2792
02:02:16,641 --> 02:02:17,840
Right,
right.

2793
02:02:17,870 --> 02:02:18,920
Well,
pretty impressive.

2794
02:02:19,150 --> 02:02:21,020
Launched in the air though.
And that split,

2795
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:22,160
look at that picture.
That's crazy.

2796
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:23,353
What's it say?
I have adhd and if taking medicine for 

2797
02:02:25,161 --> 02:02:25,911
it,
since I was a kid,

2798
02:02:25,911 --> 02:02:27,530
please know,
I believe in Kink,

2799
02:02:27,531 --> 02:02:28,364
clean sport.

2800
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:30,200
I've always followed the rules and we'll
continue to do so.

2801
02:02:30,201 --> 02:02:33,710
As far as play fair play is critical to 
sport and is very important to me.

2802
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:35,660
What does that mean?
Well,

2803
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:38,300
what does that mean?
Like how does Adhd,

2804
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:39,163
how has that affected by Ritalin?
Like what is speed due to soil is Adh 

2805
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:42,933
did it,
it's one of these counterintuitive 

2806
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:45,103
things that,
I can't remember what the chemistry of 

2807
02:02:46,581 --> 02:02:47,414
it is,
but the stimulant actually counters the 

2808
02:02:49,761 --> 02:02:52,940
hyper activity and it slows you down.
It's a weird thing.

2809
02:02:53,060 --> 02:02:56,310
I can't remember why it is hyper 
activity.

2810
02:02:56,390 --> 02:02:57,500
Uh,
controversial.

2811
02:02:58,280 --> 02:02:59,400
Uh,
well Ange,

2812
02:02:59,420 --> 02:03:00,253
Adhd as well.
This is one of those sort of loose big 

2813
02:03:02,721 --> 02:03:05,540
categories that more and more people 
have gotten tossed into.

2814
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:08,630
It used to be the little boy in fourth 
grade was just,

2815
02:03:08,631 --> 02:03:09,250
you know,
he was just,

2816
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:11,600
I had a lot of energy and he was always 
running around.

2817
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:12,433
Now he's got a disease,
he's got adhd while we got to medicate 

2818
02:03:15,171 --> 02:03:16,004
him.
Why not just let them go out and have a 

2819
02:03:17,241 --> 02:03:19,740
little longer plate playtime,
you know,

2820
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:22,040
this is one of the counter arguments to 
the disease model.

2821
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:22,701
I mean,
again,

2822
02:03:22,701 --> 02:03:24,320
it's back to that.
It's a behavior.

2823
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:26,750
Uh,
now it's a disease.

2824
02:03:26,751 --> 02:03:28,540
So we got to treat it with a drug.
Uh,

2825
02:03:28,541 --> 02:03:30,680
you know,
so you have this overmedication effect.

2826
02:03:31,190 --> 02:03:34,790
Now I can't say I was a parent of an 
Adhd kid.

2827
02:03:34,791 --> 02:03:35,624
I wouldn't be glad to have some meds,
but I think the consensus is as far to 

2828
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:42,320
mow much medication of children,
uh,

2829
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:43,940
who really it the be hate.
You know,

2830
02:03:43,941 --> 02:03:44,780
it's a spectrum,
you know,

2831
02:03:44,781 --> 02:03:46,490
if you're just completely out of control
of it here,

2832
02:03:46,491 --> 02:03:49,760
but most that are taking the drugs are 
probably in the bell curve somewhere.

2833
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:52,880
Not that bad.
I think that's really important that you

2834
02:03:52,881 --> 02:03:54,860
point that out,
that there is this great big spectrum.

2835
02:03:54,860 --> 02:03:56,450
Like a lot of things we've been talking 
about.

2836
02:03:56,470 --> 02:03:57,303
There's,
there's people that are almost 

2837
02:03:58,101 --> 02:04:00,020
unmanageable and these people that 
might,

2838
02:04:00,110 --> 02:04:01,970
a kid that might just be a little bit 
rowdy,

2839
02:04:02,330 --> 02:04:03,163
you know,
mean she just jumps up and down on the 

2840
02:04:04,161 --> 02:04:05,660
couch and you tell her not to and you're
like,

2841
02:04:05,661 --> 02:04:07,340
I'm getting this fucking kid on some 
pills.

2842
02:04:07,730 --> 02:04:08,970
And in a lot of it is,
you know,

2843
02:04:09,020 --> 02:04:11,840
teachers want control of the classroom.
It's this old,

2844
02:04:11,841 --> 02:04:12,674
it goes back to the 19th century.
You don't get to put them all in rows 

2845
02:04:15,171 --> 02:04:19,310
because we're training them to work in 
industry or be in the military.

2846
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:22,270
It's really all it was and that's all it
still is and we're,

2847
02:04:22,271 --> 02:04:23,104
we're stuck with the echoes of that.
They're to the point where if you want 

2848
02:04:26,450 --> 02:04:31,450
do something like there's a lot of 
things that you can do for a living that

2849
02:04:31,940 --> 02:04:32,773
don't involve the traditional model of 
what they're trying to teach you in 

2850
02:04:35,901 --> 02:04:38,070
school.
And when you think about

2851
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,470
those things is options.
They think they,

2852
02:04:40,471 --> 02:04:41,304
they,
they seem preposterous and they seem 

2853
02:04:43,291 --> 02:04:46,410
like a pipe dream.
Like this idea that you're going to be a

2854
02:04:46,411 --> 02:04:47,850
famous author.
Yeah,

2855
02:04:47,851 --> 02:04:49,140
sure you are.
Well,

2856
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:51,000
they like your,
that you're going to be in a band.

2857
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:52,260
Oh yeah.
You too.

2858
02:04:52,290 --> 02:04:54,940
Congratulations when someone's in a 
fucking band.

2859
02:04:54,941 --> 02:04:56,340
Right?
If someone in a band,

2860
02:04:56,430 --> 02:04:58,110
like we get all this music,
all right,

2861
02:04:58,111 --> 02:04:59,510
someone's playing this music.
Right?

2862
02:04:59,670 --> 02:05:00,810
How come I can't do it?
Right?

2863
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:01,920
You can't do it.
No,

2864
02:05:01,921 --> 02:05:03,660
I have to work.
I have to get up and work.

2865
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:04,583
Like we train these people to think that
this is the path that everyone has to 

2866
02:05:09,301 --> 02:05:10,134
take and the occasional person ejects 
from that path and goes and makes their 

2867
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:16,500
own knives or you know,
and start some sort of a weird business.

2868
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:20,340
But why can't anybody who wants to do 
that do that?

2869
02:05:20,370 --> 02:05:21,203
Well they can.
The problem is the most impressionable 

2870
02:05:23,371 --> 02:05:24,204
part of your life.
They're teaching a really important 

2871
02:05:25,621 --> 02:05:26,454
things like math and science and English
and grammar and we all need those 

2872
02:05:29,101 --> 02:05:29,934
things,
but they're also teaching you patterns 

2873
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:32,573
and they're teaching you about the 
potential for your future and this 

2874
02:05:35,311 --> 02:05:36,144
potential for your future becomes like a
reality that you can't escape because 

2875
02:05:38,671 --> 02:05:41,190
everybody else has done it.
Your friends are all doing it.

2876
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:42,810
What will call with college are you 
applying to?

2877
02:05:42,811 --> 02:05:43,644
Like what are you,
what are you gonna major when you're 

2878
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:45,420
like,
when are you going to take the bar?

2879
02:05:45,430 --> 02:05:49,010
Like what do you want to be a singer?

2880
02:05:49,070 --> 02:05:51,200
Stigmatize people who don't go to 
college.

2881
02:05:51,201 --> 02:05:52,280
So everyone feels like,
well,

2882
02:05:52,281 --> 02:05:55,820
I got to go to college and the fact is 
not everyone should go to college.

2883
02:05:55,940 --> 02:05:58,610
There's really no need for it.
It's a waste of time and money.

2884
02:05:58,920 --> 02:05:59,753
Uh,
they're not going to get any valuable 

2885
02:06:00,621 --> 02:06:03,500
skills that they can actually use.
And they don't even want to be there.

2886
02:06:03,501 --> 02:06:04,334
But they feel like,
like my parents want me to go and my 

2887
02:06:05,751 --> 02:06:08,030
friends are all going and society.
He says,

2888
02:06:08,031 --> 02:06:09,890
I gotta have a decree,
so I got to go.

2889
02:06:10,550 --> 02:06:11,383
You know.
And so now he had this perforation 

2890
02:06:12,161 --> 02:06:14,150
operation of colleges and universities 
that,

2891
02:06:14,151 --> 02:06:16,310
and you know,
the skyrocketing costs and so on.

2892
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:18,380
What was wrong with trade schools,
you know,

2893
02:06:18,381 --> 02:06:20,150
now trade schools are kind of looked 
down upon.

2894
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:21,410
There's nothing wrong with trade 
schools.

2895
02:06:21,411 --> 02:06:23,020
Trade schools are great,
but you know,

2896
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:23,873
sort of stigmatized it.
And I think it's artificially putting 

2897
02:06:26,691 --> 02:06:27,524
people in places where they feel 
inadequate because actually somewhere 

2898
02:06:30,381 --> 02:06:31,214
else they'd be,
they'd be making a lot of money at a 

2899
02:06:33,471 --> 02:06:36,500
particular trade that they're really 
good at and they'd be happy.

2900
02:06:36,580 --> 02:06:37,413
And,
but we've altered that since the second 

2901
02:06:38,961 --> 02:06:39,920
world war that's happened.

2902
02:06:40,570 --> 02:06:42,720
The structure of school.
Uh,

2903
02:06:42,730 --> 02:06:45,220
I think it benefits kids and it gives 
them discipline and like,

2904
02:06:45,221 --> 02:06:46,660
well,
you gotta get up at seven o'clock in the

2905
02:06:46,661 --> 02:06:47,494
morning,
you got to get there and you got to 

2906
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:49,600
figure out how to get your body to get 
up.

2907
02:06:49,630 --> 02:06:51,410
You got to figure out how to fire your 
mind up.

2908
02:06:51,411 --> 02:06:52,244
But your first class at 8:00
AM I think all that's probably good 

2909
02:06:54,461 --> 02:06:57,160
because it's tests,
it's like you're,

2910
02:06:57,161 --> 02:06:59,080
you're overcoming.
And then in,

2911
02:06:59,081 --> 02:06:59,914
in overcoming and getting through those 
tests at school or getting through 

2912
02:07:02,081 --> 02:07:04,840
whatever weird social stuff you got 
going on in your classroom,

2913
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:08,980
you develop a sort of some data and get 
some experience about the world.

2914
02:07:09,010 --> 02:07:10,780
Yeah,
there's something to that,

2915
02:07:10,781 --> 02:07:15,700
but I just think this model that they 
want people to follow,

2916
02:07:15,701 --> 02:07:17,650
when I see most people following this 
model,

2917
02:07:17,651 --> 02:07:18,660
I'm like,
is this,

2918
02:07:18,710 --> 02:07:19,360
this,
this,

2919
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:22,090
just because people haven't been 
creative,

2920
02:07:22,091 --> 02:07:22,924
they haven't been imaginative and 
thinking about what they would like to 

2921
02:07:24,731 --> 02:07:27,460
do better than what they're doing now,
or is it just this,

2922
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:32,470
this pattern is so easy to slip into and
we don't even realize it until you're in

2923
02:07:32,471 --> 02:07:33,670
it.
And then he can't get out of it.

2924
02:07:33,671 --> 02:07:35,710
Right.
I am by,

2925
02:07:35,790 --> 02:07:36,160
uh,

2926
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:39,100
by like you,
udacity and the MOOC courses,

2927
02:07:39,101 --> 02:07:42,280
the teaching company courses,
all the audible books.

2928
02:07:42,281 --> 02:07:43,114
And you know,
there's so many ways to get a free 

2929
02:07:44,741 --> 02:07:45,574
education online.
Most of this stuff is free or super 

2930
02:07:47,771 --> 02:07:48,604
cheap.
Uh,

2931
02:07:48,610 --> 02:07:50,980
the knowledge is accessible.
It's there for everybody.

2932
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:51,851
You know,
it's,

2933
02:07:51,851 --> 02:07:54,970
it's sort of the how you're going to dis
in a discipline way,

2934
02:07:54,971 --> 02:07:56,920
get the information,
the thing that,

2935
02:07:56,921 --> 02:07:58,300
that words the keyword,
right?

2936
02:07:58,420 --> 02:07:59,330
Discipline.
Yeah.

2937
02:07:59,390 --> 02:07:59,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

2938
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:00,733
Because the difference between what 
you're going to do on your own versus 

2939
02:08:03,051 --> 02:08:04,930
what you're going to do in college are 
very,

2940
02:08:04,931 --> 02:08:05,764
very different,
right?

2941
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:07,550
Yeah.
But then the question becomes,

2942
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:12,180
is it healthy to take some 19 year old 
kid in the,

2943
02:08:12,210 --> 02:08:13,043
you know,
the most promising and fun and exciting 

2944
02:08:15,381 --> 02:08:17,090
moment of her life,
right?

2945
02:08:17,091 --> 02:08:17,924
You're a teenager,
you're leaving your parents' house and 

2946
02:08:21,110 --> 02:08:21,943
burden them with some insane work load 
of shit that they have to do to the 

2947
02:08:25,881 --> 02:08:26,714
point where they're always stressed out.
They're constantly dealing with tasks 

2948
02:08:29,231 --> 02:08:30,280
are always turning,
turning,

2949
02:08:30,310 --> 02:08:31,850
turning in papers.
They're always,

2950
02:08:31,851 --> 02:08:33,290
they always have to do research.
They're always,

2951
02:08:33,620 --> 02:08:37,320
they're constantly working.
Like if you look at the workload of a,

2952
02:08:37,321 --> 02:08:38,820
a kid in college,
right?

2953
02:08:38,900 --> 02:08:39,590
Like,
yes,

2954
02:08:39,590 --> 02:08:41,120
it teaches them discipline.
Yes.

2955
02:08:41,121 --> 02:08:41,954
It teaches them that it's hard out there
and you've got to really figure out how 

2956
02:08:44,811 --> 02:08:46,610
to push yourself.
It does all those things,

2957
02:08:46,970 --> 02:08:50,480
but it also robs them of a lot of fun 
times,

2958
02:08:50,481 --> 02:08:51,770
right.
In these years of their life.

2959
02:08:51,771 --> 02:08:52,604
And I'm not exactly sure if everything 
that they're learning and they're 

2960
02:08:55,701 --> 02:08:58,910
spending all this time on is even ever 
going to be beneficial.

2961
02:08:58,940 --> 02:08:59,511
Right.
In fact,

2962
02:08:59,511 --> 02:09:00,344
the argument would be that most of it is
fucking nonsense and you're never going 

2963
02:09:03,841 --> 02:09:04,860
to use it.
Right.

2964
02:09:06,230 --> 02:09:08,840
And meanwhile,
you're 19 you know,

2965
02:09:08,841 --> 02:09:11,180
and you should be having fun and 
enjoying the vitality.

2966
02:09:11,490 --> 02:09:12,323
Marion,
I was at Pepperdine University in 

2967
02:09:13,281 --> 02:09:15,200
Malibu.
I was the first member of the first four

2968
02:09:15,201 --> 02:09:16,034
year graduating class,
1976 classes 76 and I was at the jock 

2969
02:09:19,521 --> 02:09:20,354
dorm with a bunch of baseball players 
and tennis players and just just rowdy 

2970
02:09:23,511 --> 02:09:25,880
guys and they're all,
I can't wait to get out of college.

2971
02:09:25,881 --> 02:09:27,170
I didn't want to get out there on my 
own.

2972
02:09:27,171 --> 02:09:29,390
It's like,
when are we ever going to live in Malibu

2973
02:09:29,391 --> 02:09:29,901
again?
You know,

2974
02:09:29,901 --> 02:09:33,540
here we are playing ping pong and he'd 
go and just having,

2975
02:09:33,650 --> 02:09:35,630
you know,
there's the ocean Pacific Ocean is right

2976
02:09:35,631 --> 02:09:37,490
there and the gym and you know,
it's like,

2977
02:09:38,030 --> 02:09:38,863
unless you're oprah or something,
you're not going to be living like this 

2978
02:09:41,181 --> 02:09:42,130
again.
So,

2979
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:45,800
so true.
That place isn't like the perfect spot.

2980
02:09:46,190 --> 02:09:48,170
He mentioned that land now.
Oh my God,

2981
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:51,320
Mrs ever bought that and gave it to 
George Pepperdine,

2982
02:09:51,580 --> 02:09:56,580
the company that ran it at school and 
like 69 or something.

2983
02:09:56,630 --> 02:10:00,260
That chunk of land it at a Malibu Canyon
road and pch.

2984
02:10:00,570 --> 02:10:02,600
That'd probably be billions of dollars 
now.

2985
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:03,513
Probably will be right.
If you stop and think about our mission 

2986
02:10:06,290 --> 02:10:09,940
would let them build anything.
That's right.

2987
02:10:09,950 --> 02:10:12,230
Get 'em laker tickets.
Did you see this uh,

2988
02:10:12,260 --> 02:10:13,093
Itt Tech?
You'd mentioned trade schools that made 

2989
02:10:14,391 --> 02:10:15,224
me think of it.
This shit that happened like the last 

2990
02:10:16,401 --> 02:10:17,234
two weeks,
they got completely shut down by the 

2991
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:19,993
Department of Education.
Whoa.

2992
02:10:20,300 --> 02:10:23,450
Says former ITT tech students declared 
debt strike.

2993
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:27,530
I am stuck up to my neck in debt for the
rest of my life and quote.

2994
02:10:27,980 --> 02:10:28,990
Yeah.
The problem with the,

2995
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:32,660
that my argument for tech schools are 
good is a lot of them get,

2996
02:10:32,690 --> 02:10:33,140
you know,
they,

2997
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:38,140
they turn into these diploma mills,
they basically are for profit,

2998
02:10:38,420 --> 02:10:39,051
right.
Okay.

2999
02:10:39,051 --> 02:10:41,530
To have a profit company.
But you know,

3000
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:42,373
for something like this and you end up 
churning out students that can't get 

3001
02:10:44,811 --> 02:10:47,120
jobs,
but they have this huge debt.

3002
02:10:47,570 --> 02:10:48,403
And they were,
the reason this is the story is because 

3003
02:10:49,521 --> 02:10:53,180
the federal government was financing 
some of their tuition.

3004
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:54,980
Uh,
but it turns out,

3005
02:10:54,981 --> 02:10:57,050
you know,
it was not quite a pyramid scheme,

3006
02:10:57,051 --> 02:10:59,930
but something along those lines.
And so the government just said,

3007
02:10:59,931 --> 02:11:01,280
well,
we're not going to do this anymore.

3008
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:02,153
This is the tax dollars.
And so now the students don't get the 

3009
02:11:04,491 --> 02:11:07,370
financing anymore and the school is 
still charging 50,000

3010
02:11:07,371 --> 02:11:08,420
a year or something.
It's like,

3011
02:11:08,450 --> 02:11:10,190
that's the end of the game.
Wow.

3012
02:11:10,370 --> 02:11:11,203
So a lot of these private tech school or
just private schools in general depend 

3013
02:11:14,371 --> 02:11:17,990
on federal government money through the 
students.

3014
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:18,973
So they're not really for profit in the 
sense of we're competing in the 

3015
02:11:22,251 --> 02:11:24,650
marketplace like apple versus ibm and 
it's,

3016
02:11:24,651 --> 02:11:26,420
you know,
the best product will win.

3017
02:11:26,750 --> 02:11:28,820
It's not like that they're getting 
subsidized,

3018
02:11:28,821 --> 02:11:31,490
heavily subsidized,
heavily subsidized,

3019
02:11:31,510 --> 02:11:34,730
but yet the price is so elevated that 
people can't afford it.

3020
02:11:34,850 --> 02:11:35,683
Yeah,
it's really crazy how much it costs to 

3021
02:11:36,941 --> 02:11:37,774
get an education.
And I understand that it's expensive to 

3022
02:11:40,851 --> 02:11:43,580
try to give someone an education is 
expensive.

3023
02:11:43,590 --> 02:11:46,010
Try to run you university to try it.
I mean,

3024
02:11:46,011 --> 02:11:50,090
people that are great teachers and 
professors deserve a fair pay.

3025
02:11:50,091 --> 02:11:50,924
They deserve a lot of guns.
This article by David from u m in the 

3026
02:11:54,441 --> 02:11:57,020
Atlantic atlantic.com,
uh,

3027
02:11:57,021 --> 02:11:57,854
he published the other day on why 
colleges are so expensive and he tracks 

3028
02:12:00,351 --> 02:12:04,520
like the number of professors that have 
increased over the last 50 years,

3029
02:12:04,521 --> 02:12:05,354
which is,
you know,

3030
02:12:05,750 --> 02:12:07,790
minor,
uh,

3031
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:11,830
versus the number of administrators,
deans and you know,

3032
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:15,110
support a staff and so on.
If you scroll down a little bit,

3033
02:12:16,010 --> 02:12:20,120
uh,
let's see right there.

3034
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:21,313
Uh,
so this is a in California colleges 

3035
02:12:24,111 --> 02:12:27,830
state university system from 11,600
to 12,000

3036
02:12:27,831 --> 02:12:28,664
professors.
But the number of administrators went 

3037
02:12:30,441 --> 02:12:32,740
from 3000 to 12,000
whoa.

3038
02:12:32,780 --> 02:12:34,850
That's the money.
Cause you know you're paying,

3039
02:12:34,851 --> 02:12:35,684
those are full time jobs and they all 
have healthcare and benefits and 

3040
02:12:38,181 --> 02:12:41,410
retirement and all that.
So that's where the expenses is.

3041
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:42,230
Not,
not,

3042
02:12:42,230 --> 02:12:45,560
not in the actual teaching you have,
you have a brain,

3043
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:47,480
a professor with a brain,
you know,

3044
02:12:47,481 --> 02:12:49,970
sending the ideas of the brains of the 
students in the classroom.

3045
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:51,860
It's all of the support structure around
it.

3046
02:12:52,490 --> 02:12:53,323
Not to mention these gyms and dorms and 
cafeterias that are now nice 

3047
02:12:57,531 --> 02:12:58,281
restaurants.
You know,

3048
02:12:58,281 --> 02:13:00,620
all that's expensive.
This is hilarious.

3049
02:13:00,621 --> 02:13:03,620
Listen to us.
Today's New York Times offers one modest

3050
02:13:03,621 --> 02:13:04,454
illustration.
Over the past 18 months at time reports 

3051
02:13:06,261 --> 02:13:07,094
and 90 American colleges and 
universities have hired chief diversity 

3052
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:11,533
officers.
These administrators who are hired in 

3053
02:13:14,541 --> 02:13:15,374
response to the wave of racial incidents
that con convulsed convulsed campuses 

3054
02:13:20,691 --> 02:13:22,760
like the University of Missouri over the
past year,

3055
02:13:23,110 --> 02:13:26,540
they are hooking up at an already 
thriving industry.

3056
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:29,720
Wow.
March,

3057
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:32,910
2016 the National Association of 
Diversity in Higher Education

3058
02:13:32,910 --> 02:13:35,700
held its 10th annual conference in San 
Francisco.

3059
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:38,430
Hilarious attendance.
Set a new record,

3060
02:13:38,580 --> 02:13:43,580
370 the association publishes a journal.
It bestows awards of excellence that,

3061
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:50,580
that fucking thing in the University of 
Missouri was a shocking insight into how

3062
02:13:50,581 --> 02:13:51,414
college is really working.
That lady was yelling at that student 

3063
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:58,890
who was a photographer who was his job 
to,

3064
02:13:58,950 --> 02:13:59,783
he was working for this little Melissa 
Click was the professor of 

3065
02:14:01,801 --> 02:14:03,060
communications.
Yes.

3066
02:14:03,061 --> 02:14:06,120
Which is hilarious.
The guy was an espn reporter,

3067
02:14:06,630 --> 02:14:07,463
uh,
sent there to cover the protests they 

3068
02:14:09,211 --> 02:14:11,950
were going to have and you know,
here's a professor of communication.

3069
02:14:11,951 --> 02:14:14,850
Say No press.
Not only that,

3070
02:14:14,851 --> 02:14:18,000
she asked for muscle.
That's where it got really offensive.

3071
02:14:18,001 --> 02:14:19,740
Like what are you a goon?
All right,

3072
02:14:19,741 --> 02:14:21,530
you want to bring in the gun and you see
this guy,

3073
02:14:21,550 --> 02:14:24,480
she comes up and knocks the camera,
but it's this,

3074
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:26,340
this self righteous.

3075
02:14:26,360 --> 02:14:27,070
Right.
Like,

3076
02:14:27,070 --> 02:14:30,090
and this lack of understanding.
There she is.

3077
02:14:30,091 --> 02:14:30,891
Yeah.
It was a click.

3078
02:14:30,891 --> 02:14:31,724
Yeah.
It's a lack of understanding how other 

3079
02:14:33,661 --> 02:14:34,494
people are perceiving what you're doing 
and the possibility that what you're 

3080
02:14:36,571 --> 02:14:38,130
doing is not cool at all.
Right.

3081
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:41,700
But this idea of having this safe space,
like what this is college like,

3082
02:14:41,701 --> 02:14:44,150
what are you saying?
Like let's explore what happened here.

3083
02:14:44,170 --> 02:14:46,110
What was,
what was his racial incident?

3084
02:14:46,230 --> 02:14:47,063
And let's get to the heart of that.
Let's not get angry at some guy who's 

3085
02:14:49,531 --> 02:14:53,490
taking a picture of things and then 
photographing things like you are openly

3086
02:14:53,580 --> 02:14:55,740
protesting in a public place.
Right?

3087
02:14:55,741 --> 02:14:57,630
I would assume you want attention.
Yeah,

3088
02:14:57,640 --> 02:14:59,220
it does.
That's the whole point of part of it.

3089
02:14:59,221 --> 02:15:00,054
Right?
So this idea that you can get some guy 

3090
02:15:02,161 --> 02:15:06,090
and hit his camera right when he's like,
this is a crazy person,

3091
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:08,240
but it's a person who is,
this is,

3092
02:15:08,250 --> 02:15:09,180
they have too much power.

3093
02:15:09,250 --> 02:15:11,340
Right?
There's too much authority.

3094
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:12,240
Well,
on the good side,

3095
02:15:12,241 --> 02:15:14,880
she was fired and appealed and lust.
So she's out.

3096
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:16,590
That is good.
So that's good.

3097
02:15:16,591 --> 02:15:17,091
And,
and,

3098
02:15:17,091 --> 02:15:19,950
and sad that she got to that just in the
last two weeks,

3099
02:15:19,951 --> 02:15:23,630
the one of the deans at the University 
of Chicago sent that letter out.

3100
02:15:23,650 --> 02:15:28,140
Now everyone's read it went viral.
Tall it class of 2020 no safe spaces,

3101
02:15:28,141 --> 02:15:30,510
no microaggressions.
We're not disadvantaging speakers.

3102
02:15:31,310 --> 02:15:34,160
You gotta grow up.
And um,

3103
02:15:34,530 --> 02:15:37,460
where I teach at Chapman University,
uh,

3104
02:15:37,470 --> 02:15:39,210
I sent that letter to the president and 
I said,

3105
02:15:39,211 --> 02:15:39,750
hey,
maybe,

3106
02:15:39,750 --> 02:15:41,160
you know,
maybe we should do something like that.

3107
02:15:41,750 --> 02:15:42,750
And at first he said,
well,

3108
02:15:42,751 --> 02:15:43,501
I dunno,
you know,

3109
02:15:43,501 --> 02:15:45,630
we don't really have a problem with that
here at Chapman.

3110
02:15:45,631 --> 02:15:46,890
Everything's cool.
I don't want to start there.

3111
02:15:47,220 --> 02:15:50,550
And then he decided he'd do it.
So he did it and then they orange county

3112
02:15:50,551 --> 02:15:51,750
register published it.

3113
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:53,010
And I thought,
this is great.

3114
02:15:53,130 --> 02:15:53,963
So I,
my first week of class last week to my 

3115
02:15:55,441 --> 02:15:56,700
students,
we read it,

3116
02:15:56,820 --> 02:15:57,780
I said,
this is it.

3117
02:15:57,890 --> 02:16:00,240
There is no safe spaces here on Chapman 
and so on.

3118
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:03,030
You're adults now and you know,
they seem fine with that.

3119
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:04,493
I think it's,
if you set up a system of sort of a 

3120
02:16:06,781 --> 02:16:07,614
moral panic and you start looking for 
any racial slurs or slights or it makes 

3121
02:16:13,411 --> 02:16:16,380
conversation really hazardous.
Like,

3122
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:17,970
Ooh,
I got to navigate around that.

3123
02:16:17,971 --> 02:16:19,950
I better not use,
I better be very careful.

3124
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:22,740
And all of a sudden it just shuts people
down.

3125
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:24,990
It becomes like Mccarthyism for 
morality,

3126
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:25,980
right?
You just,

3127
02:16:25,981 --> 02:16:29,530
you start looking for people who are 
violators of it and like all these other

3128
02:16:29,531 --> 02:16:30,364
things that we've discussed,
there's a spectrum and there's people 

3129
02:16:32,291 --> 02:16:37,291
that are on the extreme far fringe who 
are literally recreationally outraged at

3130
02:16:38,231 --> 02:16:42,100
everything they see all throughout the 
world without no perspective at all.

3131
02:16:42,220 --> 02:16:43,053
And instead of being able to look at 
these things and try to see things from 

3132
02:16:46,961 --> 02:16:48,610
other people's points of view and 
perspective,

3133
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:49,863
every single thing becomes a racist or 
patriarchal or homophobic or 

3134
02:16:54,581 --> 02:16:55,414
transphobic.
And there's all these different new 

3135
02:16:57,701 --> 02:17:02,701
phrases that get abelist and fat shaming
and all these different trigger warnings

3136
02:17:03,730 --> 02:17:07,330
that they would like on almost every,
and it just becomes this ridiculous nerf

3137
02:17:07,331 --> 02:17:08,164
dup environment that you're living in.
And when you're in school and you're 

3138
02:17:11,471 --> 02:17:13,840
preparing for the real world,
right?

3139
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:14,733
If you really think that you're going to
get through school with all this 

3140
02:17:18,611 --> 02:17:19,444
craziness about safe spaces and certain 
things that trigger you and what should 

3141
02:17:23,441 --> 02:17:26,080
be,
what should be legal and you know,

3142
02:17:26,110 --> 02:17:26,943
cultural appropriation,
white people shouldn't be wearing 

3143
02:17:28,631 --> 02:17:31,390
dreadlocks and all that nonsense that 
they're showing these kids.

3144
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:32,613
It's fucking crazy.
It's crazy to assume that you can get 

3145
02:17:35,951 --> 02:17:36,784
through that and then become a 
functioning member of society and work 

3146
02:17:40,061 --> 02:17:42,910
with 40 year old people who think you're
retarded.

3147
02:17:42,970 --> 02:17:46,180
Right.
I'm giving a talk next week at cal state

3148
02:17:46,181 --> 02:17:47,014
fullerton on this very subject because 
last year the sorority got in trouble 

3149
02:17:50,111 --> 02:17:52,270
because they held a taco Tuesday.
Yes,

3150
02:17:52,271 --> 02:17:53,104
I saw that cultural appropriation.
I saw that really part of it is I think 

3151
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:01,530
the lack of realization that,
that,

3152
02:18:01,630 --> 02:18:03,460
that there just are assholes in the 
world.

3153
02:18:03,461 --> 02:18:05,860
People there are just bad,
nasty people or whatever.

3154
02:18:06,190 --> 02:18:07,690
The question is,
how do you deal with them?

3155
02:18:08,170 --> 02:18:11,500
So like a Chapman for example,
last year that the Lgbtq,

3156
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:13,990
uh,
a community and a,

3157
02:18:13,991 --> 02:18:16,000
these are new new ones,
lgbt.

3158
02:18:16,001 --> 02:18:20,530
So the cue is questioning or queer.
I thought it was just queer.

3159
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:21,311
Uh,
well,

3160
02:18:21,311 --> 02:18:24,250
no question in case you're not sure 
where he shouldn't.

3161
02:18:24,251 --> 02:18:25,084
We have two queues just so we don't 
discriminate between the poor and the 

3162
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:29,110
questionnaires.
That's right.

3163
02:18:29,180 --> 02:18:32,220
Let's make that so please people.
Let's not be insensitive.

3164
02:18:32,230 --> 02:18:34,470
Let's see.
I think intersectionality,

3165
02:18:34,970 --> 02:18:36,270
intersectionality,
I think,

3166
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:39,070
have you seen between sec there?

3167
02:18:39,100 --> 02:18:40,990
I think that's for the biological.
You have,

3168
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:41,853
you have a different genitals and you 
feel like you should have or something 

3169
02:18:45,671 --> 02:18:47,530
like that.
Have you seen pansexual?

3170
02:18:47,950 --> 02:18:48,783
Yes.
That that was a woman who was a 

3171
02:18:49,781 --> 02:18:51,760
congressperson.
I think she was.

3172
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:54,640
Who came out as pansexual?
Is that what she was?

3173
02:18:54,641 --> 02:18:55,870
No,
she wasn't a congressman.

3174
02:18:55,871 --> 02:18:57,250
She's a state representative,
I think.

3175
02:18:57,550 --> 02:18:59,880
What the fuck does she do?
She came out as pan sex.

3176
02:18:59,881 --> 02:19:02,590
The first pansexual politician.
Right.

3177
02:19:03,310 --> 02:19:04,320
What is pansexual,
man?

3178
02:19:04,321 --> 02:19:05,154
Again,
like it means you're,

3179
02:19:05,170 --> 02:19:07,560
I think it's everything.
You're a freak.

3180
02:19:07,561 --> 02:19:11,200
You're a little bit of Mary Gonzales,
Texas state representative identifies as

3181
02:19:11,201 --> 02:19:16,201
pansexual in new interview.
Oh my goodness.

3182
02:19:18,570 --> 02:19:20,320
Don't believe in a gender binary.
Oh yes.

3183
02:19:20,321 --> 02:19:21,610
That's it.
Not No gender by,

3184
02:19:21,850 --> 02:19:24,700
so this is called CSS,
so sexist,

3185
02:19:24,910 --> 02:19:28,430
Hetero Patriarchy that you,
that it's only two

3186
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:29,293
men and women and that that is 
discriminatory because there's people 

3187
02:19:32,061 --> 02:19:33,950
that are in between.
I think there are.

3188
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:36,170
I think there definitely are.
I think there's,

3189
02:19:36,470 --> 02:19:37,303
there's people that have different 
levels of intelligence as people that 

3190
02:19:40,521 --> 02:19:42,680
are shorter.
There's people that have different,

3191
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,100
different levels of sexual desire.
There's,

3192
02:19:47,150 --> 02:19:52,040
and there's gotta be people that are on 
the borderline between a man and a woman

3193
02:19:52,041 --> 02:19:52,874
and they choose to do either or.
I think of him as fuzzy sets with a 

3194
02:19:55,941 --> 02:19:57,750
little bit of overlapping on the 
borders,

3195
02:19:57,770 --> 02:19:59,690
right?
Most people are in one or the other.

3196
02:19:59,990 --> 02:20:01,460
Yes.
There are people in between.

3197
02:20:01,490 --> 02:20:02,323
Okay,
what do we,

3198
02:20:02,810 --> 02:20:03,621
what do we do?
Nothing.

3199
02:20:03,621 --> 02:20:05,600
You don't have to do anything.
Don't discriminate.

3200
02:20:05,601 --> 02:20:06,434
Yes,
of course.

3201
02:20:06,830 --> 02:20:07,611
You know,
you know,

3202
02:20:07,611 --> 02:20:08,444
don't say to an Asian person,
you must be good at math because you're 

3203
02:20:11,331 --> 02:20:13,910
Asian or like that.
Yeah.

3204
02:20:13,911 --> 02:20:14,744
Don't be a dick.

3205
02:20:14,820 --> 02:20:18,800
But isn't that compliment?
Like if you see a black eye and he say,

3206
02:20:18,801 --> 02:20:20,510
you must have a big Dick because you're 
a black guy,

3207
02:20:21,480 --> 02:20:24,920
how's he going to go?
You racist piece of shit is not right.

3208
02:20:24,950 --> 02:20:27,140
If you say to a guy like,
you must be a genius.

3209
02:20:27,141 --> 02:20:27,974
You're a,
an European cheap flight that they get 

3210
02:20:30,201 --> 02:20:31,790
upset at you for that.
It's like that line.

3211
02:20:31,791 --> 02:20:34,000
And Howard Howard Stern's movie where 
he,

3212
02:20:34,130 --> 02:20:37,790
you Jewish kid at a black high school in
Jersey and he said,

3213
02:20:37,791 --> 02:20:38,624
uh,
they say it's a stereotype that blacks 

3214
02:20:39,531 --> 02:20:43,190
have bigger penises than whites and it 
may be a stereotype,

3215
02:20:43,191 --> 02:20:47,300
but I wish I had a stereotype like that.
Anyway.

3216
02:20:47,710 --> 02:20:48,543
Um,
so last year I went to this little safe 

3217
02:20:50,991 --> 02:20:55,991
space talk discussion at the Lgbtq.
I don't forget day Chatman.

3218
02:20:57,170 --> 02:20:58,430
Okay.
So I want your sexual,

3219
02:20:58,431 --> 02:21:00,410
what was the last one?
Was the a uh,

3220
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:02,510
uh,
let's see.

3221
02:21:02,510 --> 02:21:05,690
Lgbtq a,
I forget what the analog,

3222
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,640
it's right.
As opposed to just delete.

3223
02:21:08,220 --> 02:21:10,140
I have to fuck through headphones.
Okay.

3224
02:21:10,160 --> 02:21:12,020
What that is towards.
Um,

3225
02:21:12,630 --> 02:21:16,130
just the AA,
asexual,

3226
02:21:16,190 --> 02:21:18,800
hey intersexual asexual.
That's right.

3227
02:21:18,801 --> 02:21:21,080
Just and you just have no,
that's true though.

3228
02:21:21,081 --> 02:21:23,920
There are people that are like our sex,
so you know,

3229
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:24,763
there's truth and all these things and 
the people that are where there's maybe 

3230
02:21:26,811 --> 02:21:28,270
a dozen people or so,
um,

3231
02:21:28,300 --> 02:21:29,150
you know,
very nice,

3232
02:21:29,151 --> 02:21:29,990
very thoughtful.
You know,

3233
02:21:29,991 --> 02:21:31,370
we,
we just like to help people.

3234
02:21:31,400 --> 02:21:32,233
Okay.
I feel left out and I think they should 

3235
02:21:33,651 --> 02:21:36,260
add an h in there.
Heterosexual.

3236
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:38,233
So then you can sort of see,
I can sort of see in this meeting how 

3237
02:21:41,121 --> 02:21:44,870
the a pseudo problem becomes a problem 
that isn't real.

3238
02:21:45,230 --> 02:21:46,160
And that is,
you know,

3239
02:21:46,161 --> 02:21:47,060
we're,
we're here to meet,

3240
02:21:47,061 --> 02:21:49,310
to discuss the problem we have.
Okay.

3241
02:21:49,311 --> 02:21:49,970
What's the problem?

3242
02:21:49,970 --> 02:21:50,803
Well,
there were some incidences against 

3243
02:21:52,850 --> 02:21:56,180
Lgbtqa people here on campus.
Okay.

3244
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:58,400
What happened?
Well,

3245
02:21:58,401 --> 02:22:00,110
first of all I just asked,
well,

3246
02:22:00,170 --> 02:22:03,080
like how many times this has happened?
Like once a day,

3247
02:22:03,081 --> 02:22:04,400
once a week,
once a year.

3248
02:22:04,550 --> 02:22:06,140
What's the rate?
Don't know.

3249
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:07,800
We don't have any data.
Well,

3250
02:22:07,810 --> 02:22:11,000
it is it worse now as much worse?
Well,

3251
02:22:11,030 --> 02:22:13,460
how many times did it happen last year 
or five years ago?

3252
02:22:13,550 --> 02:22:15,590
We don't have any data.
How do you know it's worse?

3253
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:17,540
Well,
just kind of feels worse,

3254
02:22:17,541 --> 02:22:19,040
you know,
like we get more emails.

3255
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:21,740
Okay.
That's meaningless.

3256
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:23,150
Okay.
Then it was like,

3257
02:22:23,151 --> 02:22:23,984
well,
like give me some incidences like w 

3258
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:26,070
examples.
What

3259
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:27,510
happened?
Well,

3260
02:22:27,511 --> 02:22:29,670
I uh,
I heard about this gay couple.

3261
02:22:29,671 --> 02:22:30,504
They were walking hand in hand,
sort of on the perimeter of the campus 

3262
02:22:32,551 --> 02:22:33,384
down the sidewalk of the local street.
And some guy in a pickup truck drove by 

3263
02:22:35,671 --> 02:22:38,360
and made a remark.
I said that,

3264
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:40,030
that's it.
Uh,

3265
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:40,880
you know,
there's just,

3266
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:42,590
you know,
there are assholes driving around,

3267
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:44,461
you know,
it's just,

3268
02:22:44,461 --> 02:22:45,294
you're never,
that's never going to be zero and 

3269
02:22:46,711 --> 02:22:47,544
there's no place you're going to go 
where you're going to be safe from that 

3270
02:22:49,411 --> 02:22:51,540
in the world.
And so the question,

3271
02:22:51,541 --> 02:22:53,290
how do you deal with that?
You know,

3272
02:22:53,330 --> 02:22:55,050
well,
you can just say fuck off asshole,

3273
02:22:55,051 --> 02:22:57,420
or just ignore him or you know,
whatever.

3274
02:22:57,421 --> 02:22:59,610
But you know,
the idea of I'm hurt,

3275
02:22:59,611 --> 02:23:01,320
I'm injured,
I'm damaged,

3276
02:23:02,030 --> 02:23:02,863
and I have to go and meet with my people
where we talk about how it hurt and 

3277
02:23:05,671 --> 02:23:06,090
damaged.

3278
02:23:06,090 --> 02:23:10,180
We feel that's gonna make it worse.
I think it's going to turn,

3279
02:23:10,950 --> 02:23:11,783
not a non problem,
but a minuscule problem into a big 

3280
02:23:14,461 --> 02:23:15,900
problem that doesn't need to be that 
way.

3281
02:23:15,930 --> 02:23:17,460
That that's my opinion of that.
Well,

3282
02:23:17,461 --> 02:23:18,294
we're,
we're really generalizing here because 

3283
02:23:20,701 --> 02:23:21,534
right.
We don't know what this supposedly 

3284
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:24,730
aggressor said.
Right.

3285
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:26,790
And there's a bunch of different things 
that could have said,

3286
02:23:27,150 --> 02:23:28,470
you know,
they could have drove by and go,

3287
02:23:28,471 --> 02:23:32,070
I love your hair.
And then just kept going like this piece

3288
02:23:32,071 --> 02:23:33,900
of shit.
He just totally gender,

3289
02:23:34,270 --> 02:23:35,820
right?
There's the dominoes,

3290
02:23:35,970 --> 02:23:36,781
right?
That's right.

3291
02:23:36,781 --> 02:23:41,010
Of course there's some preposterous 
recreational outrage that really,

3292
02:23:41,370 --> 02:23:43,980
on one hand it's what,
what is,

3293
02:23:44,010 --> 02:23:46,470
what's bad about it is it's indulgent 
and silly.

3294
02:23:46,500 --> 02:23:47,333
But what's also bad about it is it 
develops this cry wolf mentality where 

3295
02:23:52,620 --> 02:23:55,860
when you see people getting offended by 
things that are so fucking ridiculous,

3296
02:23:56,220 --> 02:24:00,330
you will almost be willing to dismiss 
everything on their team.

3297
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:01,493
You know,
everything that they're trying to push 

3298
02:24:02,401 --> 02:24:04,800
forth at some of the things might have 
some merit to them.

3299
02:24:04,801 --> 02:24:06,420
Some of the things might be really 
valid,

3300
02:24:06,710 --> 02:24:08,700
but,
but it's all in the same camp,

3301
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:09,713
right?
These ridiculous over sensitive people 

3302
02:24:12,571 --> 02:24:15,330
that are looking to get recreational 
outreach all the time.

3303
02:24:15,331 --> 02:24:16,164
So they might attach themselves to 
really legitimate points that people 

3304
02:24:18,661 --> 02:24:20,310
that might be more,
um,

3305
02:24:20,610 --> 02:24:25,080
sort of a more rigid or conservative in 
their ideology.

3306
02:24:25,081 --> 02:24:26,850
They rejected outright.
They don't,

3307
02:24:26,851 --> 02:24:29,020
won't even consider it because it's 
these fucking dummies.

3308
02:24:29,030 --> 02:24:29,970
Right.
And they're,

3309
02:24:30,030 --> 02:24:30,601
you know,
they're,

3310
02:24:30,601 --> 02:24:34,170
they're crazy outrage and there's safe 
spaces like these people,

3311
02:24:34,300 --> 02:24:37,680
they might be attached to some really 
good ideas about how,

3312
02:24:37,890 --> 02:24:38,723
maybe it's not a good idea to have a 
bunch of guys on your campus yelling 

3313
02:24:42,031 --> 02:24:42,864
shit out at girls as they walk by it.
And maybe we can figure out how to stop 

3314
02:24:45,511 --> 02:24:46,110
that.

3315
02:24:46,110 --> 02:24:47,030
Well,
and that's right.

3316
02:24:47,031 --> 02:24:49,800
So all of these have little kernel of 
truth and moral progress.

3317
02:24:49,801 --> 02:24:50,790
As I said,
it happens,

3318
02:24:50,791 --> 02:24:51,541
you know,
bottom up,

3319
02:24:51,541 --> 02:24:56,360
change language and so on.
So it starts off well intentioned that.

3320
02:24:56,430 --> 02:24:58,320
So the question is,
what do you do when somebody,

3321
02:24:58,340 --> 02:24:59,790
you know,
says something offensive,

3322
02:24:59,820 --> 02:25:00,653
you know,
uh,

3323
02:25:00,690 --> 02:25:01,523
I mean,
do we turn it into a massive campus 

3324
02:25:02,641 --> 02:25:05,760
crisis or do you just say to the guy,
dude,

3325
02:25:05,790 --> 02:25:06,930
that's not cool.
Just feel,

3326
02:25:06,931 --> 02:25:08,880
say that kind of Shit.
It's not acceptable.

3327
02:25:08,910 --> 02:25:09,990
You know,
so like the,

3328
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:10,833
the,
the Halloween costume incident at Yale 

3329
02:25:12,691 --> 02:25:14,370
last year.
Okay.

3330
02:25:14,670 --> 02:25:15,480
So,
uh,

3331
02:25:15,480 --> 02:25:16,020
you know,
the,

3332
02:25:16,020 --> 02:25:16,853
the,
the faculty members sent out that email 

3333
02:25:18,511 --> 02:25:19,230
that said,
you know,

3334
02:25:19,230 --> 02:25:20,063
you're adults,
we're not going to tell you what 

3335
02:25:20,701 --> 02:25:23,250
costumes you can and cannot wear and 
this erupted.

3336
02:25:23,350 --> 02:25:23,801
They say,
well,

3337
02:25:23,801 --> 02:25:26,500
what if somebody shows up in blackface?
Okay,

3338
02:25:26,501 --> 02:25:27,380
I'll admit,
you know,

3339
02:25:27,430 --> 02:25:30,110
somebody shows up in black face at a 
Halloween party that's,

3340
02:25:30,130 --> 02:25:30,963
that's getting,
that's kind of pushing the touristic 

3341
02:25:32,100 --> 02:25:32,620
move.

3342
02:25:32,620 --> 02:25:35,740
You can see your Al Jolson though,
you know,

3343
02:25:35,741 --> 02:25:39,340
but if you have a Mexican,
had a Sombrero,

3344
02:25:39,341 --> 02:25:42,070
are you dressed up as a native American?
I mean really.

3345
02:25:42,071 --> 02:25:44,500
I mean,
so there's sort of scales from offensive

3346
02:25:44,501 --> 02:25:45,880
to you inoffensive.
Well,

3347
02:25:45,881 --> 02:25:49,240
is it more offensive to wear black face 
than it is to wear red face?

3348
02:25:49,270 --> 02:25:51,840
I have no idea.
But it seems to be that can,

3349
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:53,890
you can kind of get away with red face 
till,

3350
02:25:53,891 --> 02:25:55,210
right?
Uh,

3351
02:25:55,211 --> 02:25:56,340
well the Redskins,
you know,

3352
02:25:56,530 --> 02:25:59,290
probably not after we talked about this,
I'll pass some new rules.

3353
02:25:59,890 --> 02:26:01,540
We have to sit down,
but side,

3354
02:26:01,541 --> 02:26:03,430
what are you upset about it?
But why not just,

3355
02:26:03,431 --> 02:26:05,050
you know,
these are adults we don't need to tell,

3356
02:26:05,051 --> 02:26:07,180
you know,
tell them how to play in the sandbox.

3357
02:26:07,220 --> 02:26:10,810
Just ladies,
if your cat called,

3358
02:26:11,060 --> 02:26:11,893
you know,
just tell the guy shut the fuck up or 

3359
02:26:13,571 --> 02:26:17,830
fuck off or just ignore them well and 
got and tell the guy guy should be too.

3360
02:26:17,831 --> 02:26:19,110
You know guys,
you know you want to,

3361
02:26:19,130 --> 02:26:21,670
you want to get laid cat calling a woman
is,

3362
02:26:21,780 --> 02:26:24,090
it's going to have the opposite effect.
Now you never know.

3363
02:26:24,120 --> 02:26:26,430
Don't do some freaks out there and you 
might call them in.

3364
02:26:26,980 --> 02:26:30,520
Well I call them and look at elk call.
I don't have any data on that.

3365
02:26:30,521 --> 02:26:33,790
I'm afraid this freaks to freak studies 
out there.

3366
02:26:33,791 --> 02:26:36,460
They've done some studies on freaks 
journal or Freak beat.

3367
02:26:37,030 --> 02:26:38,020
Obviously I'm joking,

3368
02:26:38,220 --> 02:26:42,090
but I think that when we're talking 
about the difference between those films

3369
02:26:42,091 --> 02:26:42,924
that we watched these men beat the shit 
out of women and it was like just so 

3370
02:26:45,091 --> 02:26:45,924
standard and the outliers like when a 
person does show up on campus and the 

3371
02:26:49,011 --> 02:26:51,090
yell out sexist things,
it's like whoa.

3372
02:26:51,260 --> 02:26:53,340
Like,
this is an outrageous thing because it's

3373
02:26:53,341 --> 02:26:55,570
so rare because there has been progress,
right?

3374
02:26:55,580 --> 02:26:56,413
So even though I think that a lot of 
people in the recreational outrage 

3375
02:26:59,611 --> 02:27:00,444
community are outrageously stupid in 
their efforts to make everything in a 

3376
02:27:03,411 --> 02:27:04,244
offense,
I think that the pressure of all that 

3377
02:27:05,851 --> 02:27:10,851
craziness actually somehow can probably 
tone things down like the,

3378
02:27:11,500 --> 02:27:14,310
if the left gets so outrageous in its 
demands,

3379
02:27:14,311 --> 02:27:15,144
the right kind of meets some somewhere 
in the middle of [inaudible] get to 

3380
02:27:16,681 --> 02:27:18,270
here,
but settle the fuck down,

3381
02:27:18,300 --> 02:27:18,841
right?
You know,

3382
02:27:18,841 --> 02:27:20,630
I'll call Caitlyn Jenner,
Kaitlin,

3383
02:27:21,260 --> 02:27:22,093
Katelyn,
but let's just relax on doing that to 

3384
02:27:24,031 --> 02:27:24,864
six year olds.

3385
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:25,920
You know,
it's like,

3386
02:27:25,921 --> 02:27:26,754
let's figure out a comfortable medium.
And then in becoming more and more 

3387
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:32,850
tolerant as time goes on,
it'll just be the norm.

3388
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:36,930
Just like slapping people in those 
movies was normal in 1960.

3389
02:27:36,931 --> 02:27:38,460
But in today,
it's outrageous.

3390
02:27:38,461 --> 02:27:41,010
And in a television show,
like to the moon,

3391
02:27:41,011 --> 02:27:43,080
alice,
if you had a new guy,

3392
02:27:43,290 --> 02:27:44,123
you know,
like the,

3393
02:27:44,170 --> 02:27:45,270
um,
you know,

3394
02:27:45,271 --> 02:27:48,660
some Kevin James,
Kevin James is in some new sitcom.

3395
02:27:48,750 --> 02:27:50,340
We threatened to beat the shit out of 
his wife,

3396
02:27:50,370 --> 02:27:50,881
right?
Like,

3397
02:27:50,881 --> 02:27:51,714
Whoa,
how long would that show stay on the 

3398
02:27:53,330 --> 02:27:55,350
air?
There's been progress made.

3399
02:27:55,351 --> 02:27:56,041
Yeah,
absolutely.

3400
02:27:56,041 --> 02:27:57,360
So I think,
you know,

3401
02:27:57,361 --> 02:27:58,194
people getting outrageously upset about 
things that merit being outrageously 

3402
02:28:02,341 --> 02:28:04,320
upset.
It makes everybody think,

3403
02:28:04,321 --> 02:28:05,154
but when people were outrageously upset 
about someone having a fucking Taco 

3404
02:28:09,180 --> 02:28:09,780
Tuesday,
right?

3405
02:28:09,780 --> 02:28:10,613
You know,
or trying to cut some white dudes 

3406
02:28:12,631 --> 02:28:14,250
dreadlocks off like,
okay,

3407
02:28:14,520 --> 02:28:15,353
you're losing me here,
you're going too far going too far the 

3408
02:28:17,851 --> 02:28:18,180
other way.

3409
02:28:18,180 --> 02:28:19,350
You're not reasonable.
Right?

3410
02:28:19,390 --> 02:28:21,680
You look at and get pissed off over 
nonsense.

3411
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:23,113
Like there's things to be like,
you hear about that kid who got away 

3412
02:28:24,891 --> 02:28:29,891
with raping some girl and he was,
the girl had been passed out and he only

3413
02:28:30,591 --> 02:28:35,591
got six months and now that six months,
that is something to be erased.

3414
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:37,393
That's a real scary thing.
But you should be really pissed off 

3415
02:28:40,101 --> 02:28:43,250
about not Taco fucking Tuesday.
Right?

3416
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:44,533
So there,
I think that hurts the cause of real 

3417
02:28:46,430 --> 02:28:47,263
injustices that need to be corrected.
Then they get lumped in with the silly 

3418
02:28:50,571 --> 02:28:51,404
stuff and it's not.
So we have to get away from binary 

3419
02:28:54,470 --> 02:28:56,650
thinking to scale thinking,
yes,

3420
02:28:56,980 --> 02:28:58,250
you know,
it's a spectrum.

3421
02:28:58,520 --> 02:28:59,353
And choosing gender teams too.
It becomes a real issue because there's 

3422
02:29:02,001 --> 02:29:02,834
pieces of shit on the male side and 
there's really fucking questionable 

3423
02:29:06,141 --> 02:29:07,550
people in the female side too.

3424
02:29:07,550 --> 02:29:09,260
Right?
Like that mattress girl thing.

3425
02:29:09,340 --> 02:29:11,240
All right.
You know where this Columbia,

3426
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:12,113
you guys suing the school now she 
collected her diploma with a mattress 

3427
02:29:15,950 --> 02:29:17,930
and we don't know what happened because 
we weren't there,

3428
02:29:17,931 --> 02:29:22,010
but there's some crazy texts exchanged 
back and forth where she's asking him to

3429
02:29:22,011 --> 02:29:24,050
come over and find her in the ass or 
something.

3430
02:29:24,051 --> 02:29:25,670
Is that what she said?
Did I make that up?

3431
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:27,860
Allegedly find that out.
I don't want to get sued.

3432
02:29:28,490 --> 02:29:31,010
Super important that you be real clear.
I mean,

3433
02:29:31,011 --> 02:29:35,690
I don't know what the fuck happened,
but if it really is something like that.

3434
02:29:35,750 --> 02:29:36,590
What was the,
uh,

3435
02:29:36,591 --> 02:29:39,950
the false rape accusation that made it 
to the New York Times or excuse me,

3436
02:29:39,951 --> 02:29:41,690
a rolling stone.
The Rolling Stone,

3437
02:29:42,410 --> 02:29:44,020
was it Virginia?
Yeah.

3438
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:46,400
I mean that is crazy.
Yeah,

3439
02:29:46,460 --> 02:29:47,293
that's crazy.
And when something gets to the point 

3440
02:29:48,801 --> 02:29:49,634
where it's in rolling stone,
it's a complete total fabrication like 

3441
02:29:51,651 --> 02:29:52,484
that where somebody just made something 
up and it didn't go through the proper 

3442
02:29:55,011 --> 02:29:55,844
channels because everything with dealing
with gender and all these issues that 

3443
02:29:58,911 --> 02:29:59,744
are super sensitive issues gets treated 
with kid gloves instead of approaching 

3444
02:30:02,721 --> 02:30:03,554
it with the same kind of skepticism,
they would up murder case or a case of 

3445
02:30:07,701 --> 02:30:08,520
theft.

3446
02:30:08,520 --> 02:30:13,520
Instead it gets immediately looked at 
like there's one possible scenario here.

3447
02:30:14,540 --> 02:30:17,210
This woman has been victimized to 
question her would be horrific.

3448
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:18,073
Right?
And you shouldn't even observe the 

3449
02:30:18,741 --> 02:30:20,630
facts.
He shouldn't even have an open mind.

3450
02:30:20,810 --> 02:30:21,643
You have to go into it with this,
even though you really don't have any 

3451
02:30:24,021 --> 02:30:26,330
information really whatsoever other than
people talking,

3452
02:30:26,450 --> 02:30:27,283
right.
You have to go into it with this idea 

3453
02:30:28,041 --> 02:30:29,750
that this person talking,
he's telling you the truth.

3454
02:30:29,751 --> 02:30:31,670
Right?
Otherwise you're blaming the victim.

3455
02:30:31,880 --> 02:30:32,630
I mean,
he's shocked.

3456
02:30:32,630 --> 02:30:34,100
Fuck me in the butt.
Thank you.

3457
02:30:34,430 --> 02:30:35,263
I got nervous.
She said bluntly during one facebook 

3458
02:30:37,131 --> 02:30:38,120
exchange.
See,

3459
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:39,373
I don't know what happened between them.
And if someone sends you a text like 

3460
02:30:41,811 --> 02:30:42,644
that,
it doesn't mean that you're allowed to 

3461
02:30:42,951 --> 02:30:43,784
rape them,
but his version of what happened versus 

3462
02:30:45,891 --> 02:30:50,060
her version would happen.
You don't know who's telling the truth.

3463
02:30:50,540 --> 02:30:52,280
You just don't know.
And when,

3464
02:30:52,430 --> 02:30:53,263
when things get so outrageous that this 
rolling stone thing gets published and 

3465
02:30:58,941 --> 02:31:03,290
gets treated with kid gloves and one of 
the most important magazines in American

3466
02:31:03,291 --> 02:31:04,220
crusher,
right,

3467
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:05,233
treats this as if it's a real story and 
it turns out to be a complete 

3468
02:31:07,251 --> 02:31:10,550
fabrication.
It's sort of in some ways highlights the

3469
02:31:10,551 --> 02:31:14,690
problems with dealing with this kind of 
stuff in a non objective way.

3470
02:31:15,350 --> 02:31:18,320
Carol tavers wrote a nice piece for us 
and skeptic on,

3471
02:31:18,380 --> 02:31:19,050
uh,
what you,

3472
02:31:19,050 --> 02:31:20,040
what we mean when we

3473
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:24,180
talk about rape and it gets his 
categorical binary thinking.

3474
02:31:24,181 --> 02:31:28,590
So there's perfect behavior and 
everything else is rape.

3475
02:31:29,490 --> 02:31:30,930
And so she talks about,
you know,

3476
02:31:30,931 --> 02:31:34,320
the dance of seduction and you know,
the guy's pressing and you know,

3477
02:31:34,321 --> 02:31:36,930
she's saying no.
And then he says,

3478
02:31:36,931 --> 02:31:39,300
okay.
Then she kind of hints that maybe okay,

3479
02:31:39,301 --> 02:31:41,220
a little bit more.
And then you just sort of,

3480
02:31:41,250 --> 02:31:42,083
you know,
the whole foreplay process is kind of a 

3481
02:31:44,671 --> 02:31:48,360
way of ending up over here and yes,
absolutely.

3482
02:31:48,361 --> 02:31:50,070
Whenever she says no,
then that's it.

3483
02:31:50,071 --> 02:31:51,780
It's no,
but it isn't like,

3484
02:31:52,110 --> 02:31:53,400
you know,
she said no,

3485
02:31:53,401 --> 02:31:54,234
uh,
when they were still at the restaurant 

3486
02:31:55,111 --> 02:31:55,944
and he just raped her anyway.
Usually if there's a whole series of 

3487
02:31:58,591 --> 02:32:02,790
steps that we never get to see or no one
knows we weren't there,

3488
02:32:02,791 --> 02:32:06,150
we don't know what happened and what the
gray area was.

3489
02:32:06,151 --> 02:32:09,480
And when she says no,
but no for now,

3490
02:32:09,481 --> 02:32:12,630
maybe later.
And none of that gets recorded.

3491
02:32:12,631 --> 02:32:14,550
So we have no idea of what happened.

3492
02:32:14,850 --> 02:32:16,410
Well,
we also have to consider the,

3493
02:32:16,411 --> 02:32:19,360
like we've been talking about with so 
many different other examples that there

3494
02:32:19,361 --> 02:32:21,510
is a giant spectrum of people's 
behavior.

3495
02:32:21,870 --> 02:32:22,703
There are men that I know that liked to 
get bossed around by women and smacked 

3496
02:32:27,241 --> 02:32:29,760
around and they like them to do terrible
things to them.

3497
02:32:29,761 --> 02:32:31,650
And they will pay these women to do 
this.

3498
02:32:31,651 --> 02:32:35,760
They'll go to a dominatrix or this woman
will insult them and hit them.

3499
02:32:36,100 --> 02:32:36,933
She beats them and paddles them.
They do all kinds of crazy stuff to 

3500
02:32:39,451 --> 02:32:40,284
them.
And a lot of these guys were like 

3501
02:32:40,591 --> 02:32:42,810
wealthy guys who have,
you know,

3502
02:32:42,840 --> 02:32:45,690
they have like high pressure careers and
I've met,

3503
02:32:45,691 --> 02:32:48,960
these guys have talked to him.
I've know guys that have had this thing,

3504
02:32:49,620 --> 02:32:50,453
but if it's the other way,
if it's a woman that likes getting 

3505
02:32:52,591 --> 02:32:55,270
smacked around by a guy,
then it becomes a crutch.

3506
02:32:55,320 --> 02:32:57,290
Like you don't even want to know that 
that girl is,

3507
02:32:57,291 --> 02:32:58,650
it exists,
right?

3508
02:32:58,680 --> 02:32:59,311
Like,
well,

3509
02:32:59,311 --> 02:33:04,050
a woman can't hire a male dominate years
to kick her ass and raper.

3510
02:33:04,230 --> 02:33:07,590
But a man can hire a woman to humiliate 
or Piss on her.

3511
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:09,600
Like I know this guy likes girls to piss
on him.

3512
02:33:09,870 --> 02:33:11,640
He's crazy.
Jim Norton,

3513
02:33:11,850 --> 02:33:15,060
he's a wild man,
but he talks about it openly.

3514
02:33:15,061 --> 02:33:18,210
He's a comedian,
but he's not the high,

3515
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:20,270
high pressure,
you know,

3516
02:33:20,280 --> 02:33:23,010
executive type ties are doing it.
He's just a nut and a pervert.

3517
02:33:23,190 --> 02:33:24,780
But hilarious,
hilarious comedian.

3518
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:26,940
But it's okay.
I mean,

3519
02:33:26,941 --> 02:33:28,510
he doesn't like it and beat up,
but it's,

3520
02:33:28,770 --> 02:33:30,150
it's okay.
Like you can,

3521
02:33:30,180 --> 02:33:31,013
you can be a man and you can hire some 
women to kick your ass and you could 

3522
02:33:33,451 --> 02:33:35,520
have this desire to have this happen to 
you,

3523
02:33:35,790 --> 02:33:36,623
but we're supposed to pretend that 
there's not some women out there who 

3524
02:33:39,871 --> 02:33:40,704
doesn't want to like engage in a similar
type of activity with a man and they 

3525
02:33:45,751 --> 02:33:46,710
must exist.

3526
02:33:46,890 --> 02:33:48,990
They just do.
They just do,

3527
02:33:49,070 --> 02:33:49,903
right?
They must and if is it the same if you 

3528
02:33:53,371 --> 02:33:58,371
decide that you and you're the person 
that you have sex with,

3529
02:33:58,650 --> 02:34:02,190
if you guys decide that you,
this is the way you do things,

3530
02:34:02,310 --> 02:34:03,143
you,
you decide that she likes to smack you 

3531
02:34:04,741 --> 02:34:05,574
around and she likes to get on top of 
you and you get off on it and she tells 

3532
02:34:09,361 --> 02:34:10,770
you when you're going to have sex.
No,

3533
02:34:10,771 --> 02:34:12,470
now mother fucker we're going to,
and you're like,

3534
02:34:12,480 --> 02:34:13,740
oh,
and you got to give into it.

3535
02:34:13,741 --> 02:34:16,950
This is this weird game that you guys 
play that is completely fine.

3536
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:18,610
But if the roles are reversed,

3537
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:21,220
right,
and you do that to her and you guys both

3538
02:34:21,221 --> 02:34:23,260
get off on it,
it's a terrible crime.

3539
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:25,540
And it's interesting.
It's interesting because it's not,

3540
02:34:25,541 --> 02:34:27,500
we're not talking grape,
we're knocking down.

3541
02:34:27,501 --> 02:34:29,560
We're not talking being prorate in any 
way,

3542
02:34:29,561 --> 02:34:30,394
shape or form or pro domestic violence.
We're talking about people like Weird 

3543
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:34,990
Shit,
right?

3544
02:34:34,990 --> 02:34:38,470
And some people actually want you to 
commit crimes to them.

3545
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:41,800
Well,
imagine a scenario in which that was all

3546
02:34:41,801 --> 02:34:42,634
consensual.
And then six months later he published 

3547
02:34:45,311 --> 02:34:47,880
his story in rolling stone saying,
I never consented.

3548
02:34:47,930 --> 02:34:48,920
She beat me.
Yeah.

3549
02:34:49,090 --> 02:34:51,070
Reverse those roles it looks like.
Right?

3550
02:34:51,130 --> 02:34:51,963
It sounds terrible,
but you don't know what all the steps 

3551
02:34:53,831 --> 02:34:56,310
where there's a great little short film.
It's like fun.

3552
02:34:56,320 --> 02:34:57,820
Sounds like rape,
apology talk though.

3553
02:34:57,821 --> 02:35:00,940
You know that Rhino,
even discussing this,

3554
02:35:00,970 --> 02:35:02,600
you become a rape apologist,
right?

3555
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:03,850
So we should like be really clear.

3556
02:35:03,880 --> 02:35:04,713
That's not what I am doing.
I'm looking at all the possibilities of 

3557
02:35:08,111 --> 02:35:11,830
human behavior and I'm saying people are
fucking weird.

3558
02:35:11,950 --> 02:35:13,270
We're weird.
You know?

3559
02:35:13,271 --> 02:35:14,560
And our,
our ideals,

3560
02:35:14,561 --> 02:35:15,394
a lot of times they're shaped by popular
culture and they're shaped by songs and 

3561
02:35:18,701 --> 02:35:19,534
movies.
And those in some ways dictate more of 

3562
02:35:22,181 --> 02:35:25,600
what we expect from our life than the 
actual lives we see around us.

3563
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:28,930
Right?
As each people are fucking strange.

3564
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:30,790
They're fucking strange.
So this,

3565
02:35:30,791 --> 02:35:33,760
this new law in California,
you have to have verbal consents.

3566
02:35:33,790 --> 02:35:35,770
How do you know?
Unless you record it?

3567
02:35:36,430 --> 02:35:37,570
Yeah,
it's still,

3568
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:38,560
he said,
she said,

3569
02:35:38,561 --> 02:35:39,880
well,
I asked her verbally,

3570
02:35:39,881 --> 02:35:41,920
she said yes.
And then she says,

3571
02:35:41,921 --> 02:35:43,690
I never said yes.
How do we know?

3572
02:35:43,720 --> 02:35:44,553
Did you see the video that got released 
with this really wealthy billionaire 

3573
02:35:46,691 --> 02:35:50,710
character in Florida filmed his 
girlfriend beating herself up?

3574
02:35:51,460 --> 02:35:55,120
She's on the bed and he put in a 
security camera because,

3575
02:35:55,480 --> 02:35:56,313
I don't know,
maybe he just knew she was gonna do 

3576
02:35:57,671 --> 02:35:58,630
something crazy like this.

3577
02:35:58,630 --> 02:36:00,720
So he's breaking up with her.
And uh,

3578
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:02,080
she told the police,
he beat her up.

3579
02:36:02,250 --> 02:36:05,530
She's on the bed,
whaling herself in the face,

3580
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:06,753
and there's video this screaming at the 
top of her lungs were weighing yourself 

3581
02:36:09,131 --> 02:36:09,964
into a frenzy,
probably with the windows open so the 

3582
02:36:11,591 --> 02:36:12,424
neighbors can hear it.
And she's just beating the shit out of 

3583
02:36:14,531 --> 02:36:15,580
herself.
So what does,

3584
02:36:15,581 --> 02:36:17,650
he didn't have video.
He'd be screwed.

3585
02:36:17,710 --> 02:36:18,770
Exactly.
Yeah.

3586
02:36:18,771 --> 02:36:20,860
And many people have been for sure.
I mean,

3587
02:36:20,861 --> 02:36:21,790
this is not,
again,

3588
02:36:21,791 --> 02:36:24,670
this is not being a domestic violence 
apologist.

3589
02:36:24,671 --> 02:36:26,950
This is not saying that men don't beat 
women.

3590
02:36:27,170 --> 02:36:30,340
It's just saying when we look at things,
as you know,

3591
02:36:30,341 --> 02:36:32,710
I'm a man so I side with all men,
or I'm a woman.

3592
02:36:32,711 --> 02:36:35,710
So the women must be telling the truth 
when they're just people.

3593
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:39,280
There's awesome people that are men.
There's awesome people that are women.

3594
02:36:39,430 --> 02:36:42,650
There's awesome people that are asexual.
It just does a really good,

3595
02:36:43,190 --> 02:36:46,240
a really good little film short online.
I can't remember the producer.

3596
02:36:46,241 --> 02:36:47,051
It might've been right,
man.

3597
02:36:47,051 --> 02:36:49,460
Is there a reitman producer?
Uh,

3598
02:36:49,480 --> 02:36:50,370
yeah,
Ivan Reitman is,

3599
02:36:50,800 --> 02:36:52,200
maybe that was it.
Anyway,

3600
02:36:52,210 --> 02:36:53,043
it's a young couple,
like in a dorm room and they're on the 

3601
02:36:54,911 --> 02:36:55,744
bed clothes on.
They're making out in foreplay and at 

3602
02:36:58,151 --> 02:36:59,440
some point he says,
you know,

3603
02:36:59,441 --> 02:37:00,970
I think I,
I better get the,

3604
02:37:00,971 --> 02:37:02,410
you know the thing.
And she goes,

3605
02:37:02,411 --> 02:37:02,771
yeah,
yeah,

3606
02:37:02,771 --> 02:37:03,604
I think you should.
And you're thinking he's going to reach 

3607
02:37:04,571 --> 02:37:05,404
for a condom.
And he pulls a contract out and he's 

3608
02:37:07,481 --> 02:37:08,081
like,
all right,

3609
02:37:08,081 --> 02:37:08,920
so,
and then he,

3610
02:37:08,921 --> 02:37:11,800
and then his lawyer comes in and then 
her lawyer has it and they're like,

3611
02:37:11,801 --> 02:37:12,634
okay,
my client would like to touch your 

3612
02:37:14,051 --> 02:37:17,480
client on the breasts.
Now will your client agreed to this?

3613
02:37:17,480 --> 02:37:18,313
Okay.
So he checked this and the whole thing 

3614
02:37:19,611 --> 02:37:21,080
goes through that.
Yeah.

3615
02:37:21,100 --> 02:37:23,150
It's called consents made by his son 
Jason Reitman.

3616
02:37:23,210 --> 02:37:24,043
Oh,
that's it.

3617
02:37:24,140 --> 02:37:24,890
Oh,
there we go.

3618
02:37:24,890 --> 02:37:25,723
Yeah,
there's a hilarious one that was a pro 

3619
02:37:27,951 --> 02:37:32,951
consent video that they had released,
tried to get people acclimated with this

3620
02:37:33,291 --> 02:37:34,124
idea.
And it's a attractive young couple like 

3621
02:37:36,111 --> 02:37:39,930
hipster looking dude.
He had like a funky mustache and his,

3622
02:37:39,931 --> 02:37:42,500
he's with a girl and they're making out 
and he's like,

3623
02:37:42,501 --> 02:37:43,820
can I touch your leg?
And she's like,

3624
02:37:43,821 --> 02:37:45,170
yes.
And uh,

3625
02:37:45,171 --> 02:37:46,700
and then she's like,
can I touch your leg?

3626
02:37:46,701 --> 02:37:47,534
And he's like,
yes.

3627
02:37:47,660 --> 02:37:48,650
And he's like,
can I kiss you?

3628
02:37:48,651 --> 02:37:49,490
And she says,
yes.

3629
02:37:49,790 --> 02:37:50,870
And he goes,
can I take your shirt off?

3630
02:37:50,871 --> 02:37:51,704
She goes,
not yet.

3631
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:53,900
And they keep making out and it's,
it's Kinda hot.

3632
02:37:54,350 --> 02:37:55,550
It's Kinda hot.
Like,

3633
02:37:55,551 --> 02:37:58,240
I don't think you should fucking have to
do that all the time.

3634
02:37:58,480 --> 02:38:00,650
And especially if you're in a 
relationship with someone,

3635
02:38:00,651 --> 02:38:01,484
then it's ridiculous.
And I could understand like the first 

3636
02:38:02,691 --> 02:38:04,700
couple of times you do it,
but the video,

3637
02:38:04,701 --> 02:38:07,340
like I don't,
I don't support that being a rule.

3638
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:09,620
But if two people want to do that on 
their own,

3639
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,530
that video is kind of hot.
Like it looks like wow.

3640
02:38:12,531 --> 02:38:14,690
Eventually she said no and then she said
yes,

3641
02:38:14,691 --> 02:38:16,880
the shirt came off.
We're making progress.

3642
02:38:16,940 --> 02:38:18,560
Some things are happening.
She's,

3643
02:38:18,650 --> 02:38:21,110
she's obviously enjoying this makeout 
thing.

3644
02:38:21,111 --> 02:38:21,944
Like it's Kinda hot,
but you shouldn't fucking have to do 

3645
02:38:25,011 --> 02:38:26,600
that.
Most people have never done that.

3646
02:38:26,601 --> 02:38:30,410
And this idea that you make it a law and
then you got to enforce it.

3647
02:38:30,411 --> 02:38:31,244
How do you enforce the law?
And it's not going to work with 

3648
02:38:32,781 --> 02:38:34,760
everybody.
Some people don't want to say Shit,

3649
02:38:35,090 --> 02:38:36,500
some women don't want to talk about it.

3650
02:38:36,500 --> 02:38:38,900
Some men don't want to talk about it.
And some people want to talk about every

3651
02:38:38,901 --> 02:38:40,070
single aspect of it.
Right.

3652
02:38:40,250 --> 02:38:42,830
Find someone who meshes with what the 
look,

3653
02:38:42,831 --> 02:38:43,664
he gave an interview.
I think it might've been enrolling 

3654
02:38:44,730 --> 02:38:45,111
stuff.
No,

3655
02:38:45,111 --> 02:38:45,944
it might've been in the Atlantic where 
it Kinda college coed and the guy just 

3656
02:38:49,521 --> 02:38:51,070
kept asking her an African,
I did that.

3657
02:38:51,071 --> 02:38:53,090
She said shut the fuck up and just fuck 
me.

3658
02:38:53,930 --> 02:38:56,390
I'm on.
Well that's,

3659
02:38:56,570 --> 02:38:59,030
you know,
I mean that's okay too.

3660
02:38:59,470 --> 02:39:01,820
Right?
It's like everything's okay,

3661
02:39:02,090 --> 02:39:02,923
but as soon as you start telling people,
you've got to ask every question in the 

3662
02:39:05,751 --> 02:39:08,510
book before you do it.
No you don't.

3663
02:39:08,540 --> 02:39:09,530
No you don't.
No,

3664
02:39:09,531 --> 02:39:10,980
you just don't rape people.
Right.

3665
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:12,830
Just don't rate people and then we're 
all good.

3666
02:39:12,950 --> 02:39:13,820
All right.
It's real simple.

3667
02:39:13,821 --> 02:39:15,800
Don't hold anybody down.
Don't make them do things.

3668
02:39:15,801 --> 02:39:17,850
Don't fuck them when they're passed out,
we are done.

3669
02:39:18,750 --> 02:39:20,630
Yeah.
It's just,

3670
02:39:20,631 --> 02:39:23,270
it gets,
it gets a little silly,

3671
02:39:24,140 --> 02:39:24,973
but you know,
the intention behind it is like you're 

3672
02:39:26,451 --> 02:39:27,284
saying,
the intention behind it ultimately is 

3673
02:39:29,211 --> 02:39:30,044
about progress.
Ultimately is about making an 

3674
02:39:31,881 --> 02:39:34,760
environment,
whether it's ill intentioned or not,

3675
02:39:34,761 --> 02:39:37,760
or whether it's like ill thought out or 
not.

3676
02:39:37,910 --> 02:39:39,950
The idea is to create a safer 
environment.

3677
02:39:40,130 --> 02:39:40,963
It's just,
are you doing that or are you just 

3678
02:39:42,381 --> 02:39:43,214
annoying the fuck out of people?
And the same amount of sexual assault 

3679
02:39:45,380 --> 02:39:46,790
was going to go on it.
I don't know.

3680
02:39:47,060 --> 02:39:47,893
Right.
It's an interesting question because if 

3681
02:39:48,891 --> 02:39:49,724
you pull so far left,
do they meet in a different place then 

3682
02:39:52,251 --> 02:39:53,084
they would be if he just let them,
well boys will be boys stay away from 

3683
02:39:55,821 --> 02:39:58,610
the fraternity ladies.
You know what I mean?

3684
02:39:58,660 --> 02:39:59,493
That doesn't fly anymore.
So maybe it does in some way help and 

3685
02:40:02,181 --> 02:40:02,780
then,
you know,

3686
02:40:02,780 --> 02:40:03,613
we set,
we put up with the number of diversity 

3687
02:40:05,271 --> 02:40:05,870
officers.

3688
02:40:05,870 --> 02:40:06,703
I mean the moment you hire somebody 
whose job it is to basically look for 

3689
02:40:10,371 --> 02:40:13,530
diversity anytime it doesn't meet what,
you know,

3690
02:40:13,531 --> 02:40:15,570
whatever the criteria is at that moment 
it's like,

3691
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:16,590
okay,
we have a problem.

3692
02:40:16,730 --> 02:40:17,490
Yeah.
Okay.

3693
02:40:17,490 --> 02:40:19,590
Did we really have a problem?
Maybe a little bit,

3694
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:22,260
but now it's a big official problem.
You gotta write it up.

3695
02:40:22,290 --> 02:40:24,100
We got to make it a law.
You know,

3696
02:40:24,460 --> 02:40:26,130
betty work.
Yeah.

3697
02:40:26,131 --> 02:40:29,160
Busy work looking and then they're 
looking for trouble.

3698
02:40:29,170 --> 02:40:31,420
Like unions had been doing that since 
the beginning of time.

3699
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:34,110
That's teachers' unions.
I mean that's like a,

3700
02:40:34,111 --> 02:40:34,944
that's a big issue.
They've been creating jobs since the 

3701
02:40:37,111 --> 02:40:38,880
beginning of the time.
That was always like that.

3702
02:40:39,020 --> 02:40:42,840
I had a buddy of mine who had a job on,
um,

3703
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:44,510
what does that,
where they do the big g,

3704
02:40:44,550 --> 02:40:45,510
the javits center,
you know,

3705
02:40:45,511 --> 02:40:46,410
the javits center in New York.

3706
02:40:46,710 --> 02:40:48,780
He had a job where he doesn't even go 
there.

3707
02:40:49,180 --> 02:40:52,050
He got a check every week.
He didn't even go there.

3708
02:40:52,051 --> 02:40:55,590
He never went there.
And he was one of those no show jobs.

3709
02:40:55,670 --> 02:40:56,503
Right?
He's like some union deal that they had 

3710
02:40:58,321 --> 02:41:02,420
made probably with quote unquote 
organized crime and this,

3711
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:04,890
so all that stuff's always been fluffed 
up forever.

3712
02:41:04,950 --> 02:41:07,350
So this idea of having all these 
diversity officers,

3713
02:41:07,560 --> 02:41:10,220
they're going to fucking create conflict
just to keep their job afloat.

3714
02:41:10,410 --> 02:41:12,870
The last thing they want is them to be 
obsolete.

3715
02:41:13,440 --> 02:41:14,101
You know,
we'll look,

3716
02:41:14,101 --> 02:41:16,650
we all just decided like taco Tuesday's 
good.

3717
02:41:16,651 --> 02:41:18,660
I like Tacos and a,
yeah,

3718
02:41:18,661 --> 02:41:21,600
you can dress like an Indian if you 
really love native Americans.

3719
02:41:21,780 --> 02:41:23,040
I mean,
do you really have a respect for it?

3720
02:41:23,041 --> 02:41:24,450
And you're not like being an asshole 
about it.

3721
02:41:24,460 --> 02:41:24,931
Right.
Okay,

3722
02:41:24,931 --> 02:41:26,370
cool.
The black face,

3723
02:41:26,400 --> 02:41:27,360
we're going to leave that alone.

3724
02:41:27,540 --> 02:41:28,940
We're not going to go with black face.
But that's,

3725
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,650
that's why the only way the rule is 
don't be a deck.

3726
02:41:31,990 --> 02:41:32,823
And,
and most people know when they're being 

3727
02:41:34,231 --> 02:41:36,900
a dick and if they don't,
then then your,

3728
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:38,760
your colleagues,
a friend should tell you,

3729
02:41:38,820 --> 02:41:40,200
but can you be a dick?
And be funny,

3730
02:41:40,530 --> 02:41:41,700
like,
like,

3731
02:41:41,730 --> 02:41:43,470
okay,
like you can as a comedian,

3732
02:41:43,471 --> 02:41:45,120
I can't,
but if a white guy,

3733
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:48,140
like what if a black guy dresses like a 
white guy,

3734
02:41:48,180 --> 02:41:51,990
puts white face on and just starts doing
the most ridiculous white stereotype?

3735
02:41:52,620 --> 02:41:53,460
Well,
I remember when,

3736
02:41:53,470 --> 02:41:54,990
um,
uh,

3737
02:41:55,110 --> 02:41:59,250
ted Danson came was on,
was it the Oscars or the analyzer with a

3738
02:41:59,251 --> 02:42:00,860
penalty?
We had any host or something.

3739
02:42:00,870 --> 02:42:01,703
Right?
He was dating her at the time and he 

3740
02:42:03,511 --> 02:42:04,344
made a little joke about we'll 
chamberlains record and he showed up a 

3741
02:42:08,341 --> 02:42:09,450
leg face.
Remember that?

3742
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:10,230
That was,
uh,

3743
02:42:10,230 --> 02:42:11,100
yeah,
he got,

3744
02:42:11,220 --> 02:42:12,330
that was a big controversy.

3745
02:42:12,360 --> 02:42:13,710
Yeah.
I mean that's,

3746
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:15,030
you know,
at this point,

3747
02:42:15,031 --> 02:42:18,150
whenever that place,
it's like a bronze,

3748
02:42:18,151 --> 02:42:19,230
1980s,
I think,

3749
02:42:19,231 --> 02:42:20,064
you know what I mean?
That is hilarious that he did that no 

3750
02:42:21,511 --> 02:42:22,700
longer funny.
Yeah.

3751
02:42:22,860 --> 02:42:23,693
Isn't that crazy though?
That this is one specific look with 

3752
02:42:26,821 --> 02:42:28,920
makeup,
we do not allow,

3753
02:42:29,280 --> 02:42:33,300
you cannot pretend to be a white person 
who are,

3754
02:42:33,301 --> 02:42:35,430
you cannot be a white person who's 
pretending to be a black person,

3755
02:42:35,431 --> 02:42:39,330
but you can pretend to be anything else.
Right?

3756
02:42:39,750 --> 02:42:40,583
Like a white man can pretend there's,
it's probably good reasons for that in 

3757
02:42:42,811 --> 02:42:43,830
our history.
Well,

3758
02:42:43,831 --> 02:42:45,090
who the fuck was,
um,

3759
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:47,820
who played Charlie Chan?
It was a white guy,

3760
02:42:47,970 --> 02:42:48,803
right?
The famous Chinese detective that was a 

3761
02:42:51,121 --> 02:42:52,800
white guy.
And we,

3762
02:42:52,980 --> 02:42:53,813
when John Wayne played gingiss con and 
remember that it didn't Tom Cruise play 

3763
02:42:57,451 --> 02:43:00,090
an Asian and one of the things,
he was the last Samurai,

3764
02:43:00,091 --> 02:43:00,960
but he was a Europe.

3765
02:43:02,070 --> 02:43:03,120
That's good.
Yeah,

3766
02:43:03,630 --> 02:43:04,950
that's good.
No,

3767
02:43:04,951 --> 02:43:05,560
man,
it's,

3768
02:43:05,560 --> 02:43:07,080
it's,
it's interesting.

3769
02:43:07,081 --> 02:43:07,914
And I get it.
There was slavery and take 200 years 

3770
02:43:09,351 --> 02:43:09,870
ago.
I get,

3771
02:43:09,870 --> 02:43:11,400
I understand the whole thing.
It's,

3772
02:43:11,430 --> 02:43:14,050
it's still quite odd,
you know?

3773
02:43:14,890 --> 02:43:15,723
And when a black person puts on 
whiteface and pretends to be a white 

3774
02:43:18,071 --> 02:43:19,420
person,
no one gives up.

3775
02:43:19,421 --> 02:43:20,410
Fuck.
Here we go.

3776
02:43:20,470 --> 02:43:21,520
Right?
Warner.

3777
02:43:21,521 --> 02:43:25,110
Oh land is Charlie Chan.
That is the most non Chinese.

3778
02:43:25,280 --> 02:43:28,780
He looks totally Puerto Rican.
It was mustache.

3779
02:43:28,930 --> 02:43:31,300
What nationality was that guy?
Did he have some weird,

3780
02:43:31,301 --> 02:43:33,940
uh,
stuff that they put on his face?

3781
02:43:34,930 --> 02:43:37,540
Let's find out what a nationality is.
If you had to guess,

3782
02:43:37,541 --> 02:43:38,374
what do you say?
I say maybe he's got a little native 

3783
02:43:39,851 --> 02:43:43,090
American and I'm Swedish.
Oh God.

3784
02:43:43,360 --> 02:43:46,870
More let's practically native American 
US practically Chinese.

3785
02:43:48,050 --> 02:43:51,480
You're not close to anything.
He's so white.

3786
02:43:51,910 --> 02:43:52,743
That's like the widest race.
He could pick like what's more white 

3787
02:43:54,791 --> 02:43:55,720
than Swedish people.

3788
02:43:56,680 --> 02:43:58,850
That's the widest,
every Swedish meatballs and shit.

3789
02:43:59,590 --> 02:44:01,600
The Swiss chocolate,
Switzerland,

3790
02:44:01,601 --> 02:44:02,434
it's different country,
but that's really white for him to 

3791
02:44:05,321 --> 02:44:06,154
believe.
Charlie chance generating this just 

3792
02:44:07,001 --> 02:44:11,680
started reading this book on audio,
the for the 50 year mission sort of oral

3793
02:44:11,681 --> 02:44:13,360
history of Star Trek.
Oh Wow.

3794
02:44:13,390 --> 02:44:16,510
So they start with a alert.
Oh yeah,

3795
02:44:16,511 --> 02:44:17,710
totally,
totally.

3796
02:44:19,030 --> 02:44:20,250
Uh,
but uh,

3797
02:44:20,260 --> 02:44:21,220
you know,
the actors,

3798
02:44:21,221 --> 02:44:22,420
you know,
a black,

3799
02:44:22,421 --> 02:44:23,254
Asian and so forth,
they actually got to play a real black 

3800
02:44:25,151 --> 02:44:26,920
eye,
real Asian in a real job.

3801
02:44:27,340 --> 02:44:28,310
And that was,
you know,

3802
02:44:28,360 --> 02:44:30,640
1966 that was pretty innovative at the 
time.

3803
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:32,740
It's really important that the guy that 
played Sulu,

3804
02:44:32,741 --> 02:44:33,870
what's his name?
Um,

3805
02:44:34,270 --> 02:44:36,860
uh,
George's church.

3806
02:44:36,870 --> 02:44:37,870
Kay.
You know,

3807
02:44:37,871 --> 02:44:38,704
Japanese and all.
He was talking to this oral history 

3808
02:44:41,471 --> 02:44:45,340
about what kind of kinds of jobs he had 
before star Trek,

3809
02:44:45,370 --> 02:44:45,821
which,
you know,

3810
02:44:45,821 --> 02:44:50,380
you played the sort of obnoxious,
the servant or the obnoxious agent Asian

3811
02:44:50,381 --> 02:44:51,214
or whatever,
but never like an actual real job where 

3812
02:44:53,201 --> 02:44:54,610
you're having an important position.

3813
02:44:54,670 --> 02:44:55,600
George C K,
uh,

3814
02:44:55,900 --> 02:44:57,860
lived in an internment camp.
Yeah.

3815
02:44:58,480 --> 02:44:59,240
Right.
Yup.

3816
02:44:59,240 --> 02:45:00,310
It's terrifying.
Yeah.

3817
02:45:00,870 --> 02:45:03,220
That's,
that's how recently that was.

3818
02:45:04,750 --> 02:45:05,501
Yeah.
So,

3819
02:45:05,501 --> 02:45:06,140
uh,
you know,

3820
02:45:06,140 --> 02:45:08,590
roddenberry was something of a visionary
in that sense.

3821
02:45:08,950 --> 02:45:10,900
A little bit ahead of his time on that 
too.

3822
02:45:10,901 --> 02:45:12,180
That shows awesome.
Yeah.

3823
02:45:12,250 --> 02:45:15,850
Even to this day,
it's hit that corny place like a,

3824
02:45:15,851 --> 02:45:16,684
I watched one where a captain kirk has 
to fight that Lizard Dude with the 

3825
02:45:19,961 --> 02:45:20,794
shitty outfit on that is like,
that was done right here at Vasquez 

3826
02:45:23,351 --> 02:45:24,184
rocks right up off of 14.
You can go there and you can see where 

3827
02:45:26,501 --> 02:45:29,380
captain kirk pushed him off like near to
Panga like that way?

3828
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:29,891
No,
no.

3829
02:45:29,891 --> 02:45:32,260
Uh,
Vasquez Rosecrance is run off of highway

3830
02:45:32,261 --> 02:45:36,850
14 so he takes highway 14 so you take 
five north 14 that goes up to Lancaster.

3831
02:45:36,851 --> 02:45:37,684
Palmdale.
Oh,

3832
02:45:37,710 --> 02:45:39,830
okay.
We out there and we did a lot of,

3833
02:45:39,831 --> 02:45:41,650
of all those westerns were shot out 
there.

3834
02:45:41,770 --> 02:45:43,480
We did a lot of fear factor stuff out 
there.

3835
02:45:43,510 --> 02:45:45,560
Oh right.
Oh that's so pretty.

3836
02:45:46,060 --> 02:45:47,650
Oh wow man.
That is beautiful.

3837
02:45:47,670 --> 02:45:48,970
Yeah.
So that's where that is.

3838
02:45:48,971 --> 02:45:50,920
It's all in your plan down here.
You watched this video.

3839
02:45:50,921 --> 02:45:52,300
This is awesome.
Awesome.

3840
02:45:52,330 --> 02:45:56,290
Awesome.
This guy who's playing the lizard guy is

3841
02:45:56,291 --> 02:45:58,990
so bad.
Like everything is so bad.

3842
02:45:59,140 --> 02:46:01,900
The outfits so bad.
The movement so bad.

3843
02:46:01,901 --> 02:46:03,420
Like look how slow this is.
Look,

3844
02:46:03,421 --> 02:46:05,500
I was thinking this is fucking 
incredibly bad.

3845
02:46:06,070 --> 02:46:07,480
He swings.
Look at this.

3846
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:08,673
He's not in slow motion.
This is how the show is really playing 

3847
02:46:10,761 --> 02:46:13,220
out.
Look how slow this is.

3848
02:46:13,340 --> 02:46:14,240
Look,
he throws a kick.

3849
02:46:14,270 --> 02:46:15,350
Oh,
Captain Kirk,

3850
02:46:15,830 --> 02:46:17,220
let him catch a kick.
That's good.

3851
02:46:17,240 --> 02:46:18,100
That's bad.
Moy,

3852
02:46:18,101 --> 02:46:20,240
Tai,
he supposed to kick the leg out.

3853
02:46:20,270 --> 02:46:22,190
You don't throw the guy in the air like 
that.

3854
02:46:22,191 --> 02:46:23,280
And if you definitely throw them in the 
eye,

3855
02:46:23,281 --> 02:46:24,114
you follow up.

3856
02:46:24,290 --> 02:46:25,460
Where's your ground and pound?
Bitch.

3857
02:46:25,880 --> 02:46:26,780
Okay,
look at this.

3858
02:46:27,820 --> 02:46:30,380
How come the lizard so much now he's got
to do the helmet.

3859
02:46:30,390 --> 02:46:32,630
Slap the eardrums.
Oh right.

3860
02:46:32,900 --> 02:46:33,980
Look at this.
He's trying to bite him.

3861
02:46:34,250 --> 02:46:36,860
Look how bad this is.
My God.

3862
02:46:36,861 --> 02:46:39,590
This is amazingly bad.
But when you're 10 years old,

3863
02:46:39,591 --> 02:46:41,420
this is really,
really high drama.

3864
02:46:41,530 --> 02:46:42,650
Oh,
it was incredible back then.

3865
02:46:42,680 --> 02:46:43,910
Look,
he does.

3866
02:46:43,911 --> 02:46:46,100
He does the double ear smack in the 
Lizard,

3867
02:46:46,101 --> 02:46:46,934
can handle it,
and then he runs away like the slowest 

3868
02:46:48,921 --> 02:46:51,230
white guy that's ever walked the face of
the earth.

3869
02:46:52,220 --> 02:46:54,530
I mean,
this is so stupid hair.

3870
02:46:54,531 --> 02:46:59,531
He's got this Styrofoam Styrofoam Rock 
and watch how it looks fake to like even

3871
02:46:59,931 --> 02:47:01,670
when he's picking it up,
but he's not even straining.

3872
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:04,070
Look how weaknesses.
He throws it,

3873
02:47:04,130 --> 02:47:05,750
boom,
and it hits them right in the chest.

3874
02:47:06,200 --> 02:47:08,330
Nothing.
Sorry,

3875
02:47:08,331 --> 02:47:09,260
I can't believe this.

3876
02:47:09,640 --> 02:47:11,360
Me Ma.
Go back to hitting him in the year,

3877
02:47:11,361 --> 02:47:13,030
motherfucker.
You hit him in the ear.

3878
02:47:13,100 --> 02:47:13,933
There's hurt.
There's another video that was just 

3879
02:47:14,871 --> 02:47:18,470
released a few weeks ago of Shatner and 
the lizard monster on,

3880
02:47:18,550 --> 02:47:19,383
on his couch and they're watching a TV 
show or something and they start 

3881
02:47:21,741 --> 02:47:22,574
fighting.
He keep the thing playing cause I want 

3882
02:47:24,431 --> 02:47:26,240
to find out how this ends.
That's really stupid.

3883
02:47:26,241 --> 02:47:28,300
It wasn't the,
oh it doesn't end until uh,

3884
02:47:28,440 --> 02:47:30,710
he,
he makes gunpowder and shoots him.

3885
02:47:32,210 --> 02:47:35,420
Alright boy.
Talk about giving a guy a lot of room.

3886
02:47:35,650 --> 02:47:37,550
Look that he threw a big giant rock out 
of it.

3887
02:47:37,551 --> 02:47:41,510
It looks so fake.
This lizard all of a sudden is so strong

3888
02:47:41,630 --> 02:47:45,470
that he could take a 500 pound rock and 
throw it like it's basketball.

3889
02:47:45,590 --> 02:47:48,080
But just a few minutes ago he was 
struggling with weak ass.

3890
02:47:48,081 --> 02:47:51,080
Captain Kirk is ending a technique.
Look,

3891
02:47:51,150 --> 02:47:51,983
you hit him in the ear,
you did some serious damage and you let 

3892
02:47:54,201 --> 02:47:55,370
that go and start throwing rocks.

3893
02:47:55,700 --> 02:47:57,650
Go back to hitting him in the fucking 
ear.

3894
02:47:57,830 --> 02:48:01,040
Just go whack them in the ear.
It seems to be as a soft spot.

3895
02:48:01,070 --> 02:48:01,903
Keep doing that.
But then it the show shoal and before 

3896
02:48:03,501 --> 02:48:06,210
the 48 minutes is out,
they'll find it.

3897
02:48:06,620 --> 02:48:09,710
It's just the look so hilarious.
How slow that thing was moving.

3898
02:48:09,980 --> 02:48:12,620
It was worse than I thought it was.
See that's,

3899
02:48:12,670 --> 02:48:17,670
that's also that is there.
Oh look at this same technique.

3900
02:48:18,051 --> 02:48:22,700
Look,
that's hilarious.

3901
02:48:22,960 --> 02:48:27,680
All of themselves.
Oh well they're both.

3902
02:48:28,090 --> 02:48:31,130
That is hilarious.
He's going after we get,

3903
02:48:31,170 --> 02:48:33,020
that's hilarious.
This is really funny.

3904
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:34,880
Let me chat and he's got a good sense 
of,

3905
02:48:34,881 --> 02:48:37,030
yeah,
there's two that you're going to send up

3906
02:48:37,040 --> 02:48:37,873
of himself,
but that is that show and that that 

3907
02:48:42,231 --> 02:48:43,064
scene,
it shows in a lot of ways how far our 

3908
02:48:45,770 --> 02:48:49,010
entertainment is evolved.
I mean that is,

3909
02:48:49,130 --> 02:48:50,210
that's a comedy today.

3910
02:48:50,210 --> 02:48:51,650
Look,
if you had that on comedy central,

3911
02:48:51,651 --> 02:48:52,484
right?
If you had to like ridiculous space 

3912
02:48:53,901 --> 02:48:56,060
show,
if you call it ridiculous space show and

3913
02:48:56,061 --> 02:48:56,894
you essentially just have a lot of the 
same shit that was in regular space 

3914
02:48:59,541 --> 02:49:00,570
movie,
just reenact them,

3915
02:49:01,010 --> 02:49:02,600
laugh.
They would laugh.

3916
02:49:02,630 --> 02:49:05,560
You have the right lines that went along
with how stupid that looks yet.

3917
02:49:05,690 --> 02:49:06,523
Well,
like Mike Myers send son all the spy 

3918
02:49:07,861 --> 02:49:08,920
movies.
Right.

3919
02:49:08,940 --> 02:49:11,340
But if you watch like a science fiction 
movie today,

3920
02:49:11,341 --> 02:49:14,010
like if you ever seen that Netflix show 
stranger things,

3921
02:49:14,370 --> 02:49:17,430
I just got into it a motto for five 
episodes into it.

3922
02:49:17,431 --> 02:49:19,860
It's fucking great.
Brian Redman told me it was bad.

3923
02:49:19,861 --> 02:49:22,320
He's crazy.
It's really good.

3924
02:49:22,430 --> 02:49:25,980
It's stranger things on Netflix.
It's with a homegirl that's steal shit.

3925
02:49:26,190 --> 02:49:27,350
Winona Ryder,
she's,

3926
02:49:28,070 --> 02:49:30,750
oh no that's bad.
She's awesome.

3927
02:49:30,751 --> 02:49:33,180
And a two and Matthew Modine,
the guy from vision quest,

3928
02:49:33,660 --> 02:49:34,493
he's in it.

3929
02:49:34,530 --> 02:49:37,140
It's really good.
Really good show fallen training.

3930
02:49:37,141 --> 02:49:38,580
This oral history though.
It,

3931
02:49:38,581 --> 02:49:40,290
you know,
cause I had just had these fond memories

3932
02:49:40,291 --> 02:49:43,020
when I was 12 years old,
11 that show and now I get,

3933
02:49:43,410 --> 02:49:46,800
well shatner wanted more money and then 
when Nimo I became famous,

3934
02:49:46,801 --> 02:49:47,634
he got pissed and we started cutting his
lines and then the Neem I wanted to 

3935
02:49:49,861 --> 02:49:51,690
raise and it's like I don't really want 
to know.

3936
02:49:52,890 --> 02:49:53,723
I should keep that shit to themselves.
And that's probably pretty common with 

3937
02:49:56,881 --> 02:49:57,714
any business.
I suppose the wind screech wrote that 

3938
02:49:59,371 --> 02:50:01,230
book about saved by the Bell.
I was crushed.

3939
02:50:02,550 --> 02:50:06,270
It was that inside mma or no screech 
saved by the bell.

3940
02:50:06,271 --> 02:50:10,050
You know what to say by the bells.
It was a ridiculous children's sitcoms.

3941
02:50:10,060 --> 02:50:11,590
It wasn't on Nickelodeon.
Is that what it was?

3942
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:13,320
It was on t NBC.
NBC.

3943
02:50:13,321 --> 02:50:15,390
What was that Saturday morning,
NBC.

3944
02:50:15,460 --> 02:50:16,620
Oh,
huge show though.

3945
02:50:16,710 --> 02:50:21,420
You'd show amongst the little kids and 
one of them are rebelled and became a,

3946
02:50:21,421 --> 02:50:23,850
he did porn,
wrote books,

3947
02:50:23,900 --> 02:50:25,500
got in a knife fight,
gotten a knife,

3948
02:50:25,501 --> 02:50:27,570
fight.
Celebrity boxing.

3949
02:50:27,780 --> 02:50:29,370
If somebody beat the shit out of him.
Right.

3950
02:50:29,440 --> 02:50:30,090
It didn't,
uh,

3951
02:50:30,090 --> 02:50:33,390
Danny Bonaduce,
he beat the shit out of him,

3952
02:50:33,391 --> 02:50:33,771
right?
No,

3953
02:50:33,771 --> 02:50:35,190
he beat you up.
Welcome back Kotter.

3954
02:50:36,070 --> 02:50:37,070
Yeah.
Oh,

3955
02:50:37,260 --> 02:50:39,930
he's agreed to go to jail.
I thought he went to jail too.

3956
02:50:40,590 --> 02:50:41,790
He stabbed somebody,
didn't he?

3957
02:50:42,350 --> 02:50:44,620
Yeah,
like literally stab time the bell.

3958
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:45,780
Okay.
He's crazy.

3959
02:50:45,980 --> 02:50:47,820
And so he wrote an autobiography saying 
that,

3960
02:50:47,821 --> 02:50:48,654
um,
tiffany ever thiess and was banging 

3961
02:50:49,891 --> 02:50:52,620
everybody boxing Mario Lopez,
Bang and everybody.

3962
02:50:52,621 --> 02:50:52,981
Well,
I'm like,

3963
02:50:52,981 --> 02:50:53,814
yeah,
Duh.

3964
02:50:54,590 --> 02:50:57,430
It's Mario Lopez.
But I was in a minute,

3965
02:50:57,620 --> 02:50:59,310
here we go.
Mario wrote,

3966
02:50:59,311 --> 02:51:00,144
he wrote that,
that Mario Lopez telling even read that 

3967
02:51:06,060 --> 02:51:06,893
I liked Mario.
I was in a pitch meeting one time at 

3968
02:51:08,251 --> 02:51:09,270
Fox,
um,

3969
02:51:09,510 --> 02:51:10,380
flux reality.

3970
02:51:10,410 --> 02:51:12,660
Mike Darnell was their big reality show 
guy.

3971
02:51:12,720 --> 02:51:13,800
He's the one that brought,
um,

3972
02:51:14,660 --> 02:51:15,493
uh,
all the big American idol show type 

3973
02:51:17,401 --> 02:51:18,960
shows,
including American idol.

3974
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:21,270
Anyway,
we were pitching a skeptic show,

3975
02:51:21,960 --> 02:51:23,940
so I had a production company and 
myself,

3976
02:51:23,941 --> 02:51:24,774
and we had our waiting in the little 
room for him to be done with this 

3977
02:51:27,601 --> 02:51:32,040
meeting and he came out to apologize 
that he was late because,

3978
02:51:32,070 --> 02:51:32,903
um,
they were supposed to have a big 

3979
02:51:33,271 --> 02:51:36,480
celebrity boxing match that night.
Uh,

3980
02:51:36,540 --> 02:51:39,450
Paula Jones versus Tonya harding.
Oh,

3981
02:51:39,451 --> 02:51:41,680
Jesus.
And Tonya Hardy.

3982
02:51:41,681 --> 02:51:42,514
He got arrested that day for beating her
boyfriend up with a hubcap and their 

3983
02:51:45,361 --> 02:51:48,390
trailer park or something.
And I remember sitting there thinking,

3984
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:49,890
what am I doing here?
You know,

3985
02:51:49,891 --> 02:51:50,724
I mean,
Tin Paula Jones went up doing like 

3986
02:51:52,261 --> 02:51:54,560
penthouse or something crazy that she 
do.

3987
02:51:55,100 --> 02:51:56,520
Didn't she do one of those?
Well,

3988
02:51:56,521 --> 02:51:57,880
she did celebrity boxing.
They anything.

3989
02:51:57,881 --> 02:51:58,570
Yeah,
there we go.

3990
02:51:58,570 --> 02:52:01,230
Tonya harding did.
Is that Paula Jones?

3991
02:52:01,620 --> 02:52:02,580
Oh,
that's hilarious.

3992
02:52:02,700 --> 02:52:03,660
Yeah,
there it is.

3993
02:52:03,661 --> 02:52:04,494
Paula Jones is the woman who accused 
Bill Clinton of doing dirty things to 

3994
02:52:07,001 --> 02:52:07,530
her.
Yeah.

3995
02:52:07,530 --> 02:52:09,730
Yeah.
Paula,

3996
02:52:09,731 --> 02:52:12,130
I'm not.
Paul Jones saw Tonya harding box.

3997
02:52:12,131 --> 02:52:13,930
Doug.
Stan hope on the man show.

3998
02:52:14,290 --> 02:52:15,011
Oh really?
Yeah.

3999
02:52:15,011 --> 02:52:18,820
We had a boxing match when Tonya harding
became a boxer for a while,

4000
02:52:18,821 --> 02:52:20,530
I remember.
Right.

4001
02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:21,940
Yeah.
She was doing like,

4002
02:52:22,810 --> 02:52:25,660
maybe this was her start and yeah,
she was just,

4003
02:52:25,930 --> 02:52:27,280
she's nice.
I met her.

4004
02:52:27,340 --> 02:52:28,250
She's a nice person.
Right.

4005
02:52:28,360 --> 02:52:30,300
She's just desperate for money.
Yeah.

4006
02:52:33,070 --> 02:52:35,110
Like an ice skater there.
Yeah.

4007
02:52:35,111 --> 02:52:36,450
She's thick.
Oh,

4008
02:52:36,480 --> 02:52:37,790
she must have been a good athlete to,
I mean,

4009
02:52:37,800 --> 02:52:39,490
you can't be an Olympic ice skater.
Oh yeah.

4010
02:52:39,491 --> 02:52:40,710
For sure.
Good athlete.

4011
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:41,793
She was,
but that was a weird view into 

4012
02:52:43,721 --> 02:52:44,560
athletics.
Right.

4013
02:52:44,620 --> 02:52:48,180
When a Nancy Kerrigan is got beaten up 
by that,

4014
02:52:48,181 --> 02:52:49,450
he hit her in the legs.
Right.

4015
02:52:49,451 --> 02:52:51,460
Like hit her in the leg with a stick or 
something like that.

4016
02:52:51,461 --> 02:52:53,670
So guy like a tire iron.
Was it a tyrant?

4017
02:52:54,130 --> 02:52:54,770
He bashed?
He,

4018
02:52:54,770 --> 02:52:57,580
I think he shattered her.
Not The kneecap,

4019
02:52:57,740 --> 02:53:00,280
but right next to it or part of it or 
correct it or something.

4020
02:53:00,281 --> 02:53:01,120
Yeah,
it was pretty heavy.

4021
02:53:01,690 --> 02:53:03,580
I thought she was able to command it 
was,

4022
02:53:03,610 --> 02:53:07,640
I think it was Tonya harding boyfriend 
had hired the guy,

4023
02:53:07,641 --> 02:53:09,420
so she,
she was indirectly involved.

4024
02:53:09,440 --> 02:53:11,230
Right.
Yeah.

4025
02:53:11,260 --> 02:53:12,093
And,
um,

4026
02:53:12,340 --> 02:53:14,380
they were planning on Tonya harding 
winning the Olympics.

4027
02:53:14,380 --> 02:53:15,213
Right.
They wanted her to,

4028
02:53:16,690 --> 02:53:18,120
she,
it was her and um,

4029
02:53:18,180 --> 02:53:19,660
and uh,
Nancy Kerrigan,

4030
02:53:19,661 --> 02:53:23,920
they were the golden middle toe to 
compete competition for the gold medal.

4031
02:53:24,100 --> 02:53:24,933
Yeah.
I don't remember the extent of the 

4032
02:53:25,721 --> 02:53:26,554
injury.
I remember Nancy Kerrigan was screaming 

4033
02:53:28,031 --> 02:53:29,770
and she was holding like there was a 
video of it,

4034
02:53:29,800 --> 02:53:30,633
right?
Yeah.

4035
02:53:30,960 --> 02:53:32,890
Which is crazy.
But she came back.

4036
02:53:33,370 --> 02:53:36,370
There's a video.
Was there a video of the guy doing it?

4037
02:53:37,390 --> 02:53:38,223
I don't think so.
I think that it's got this aftermath 

4038
02:53:39,251 --> 02:53:40,270
part.
She's screaming.

4039
02:53:40,870 --> 02:53:42,460
She ended up competing in those 
Olympics.

4040
02:53:42,461 --> 02:53:47,020
I think that is so crazy that someone 
could do that.

4041
02:53:47,021 --> 02:53:50,710
Just run up to this girl and smash or 
with a tire iron.

4042
02:53:51,010 --> 02:53:52,030
Is that what it was?
What is it?

4043
02:53:52,060 --> 02:53:54,190
What he was trying to think.
So fuck.

4044
02:53:54,191 --> 02:53:55,024
That is so crazy.
That's so crazy that someone could do 

4045
02:53:57,851 --> 02:53:58,684
that because of an ice skating 
competition that instead of competing 

4046
02:54:01,601 --> 02:54:03,310
and trying to win and trying to be the 
best,

4047
02:54:03,820 --> 02:54:07,120
you hire someone as smash,
excuse me,

4048
02:54:07,121 --> 02:54:08,140
collapsible baton.

4049
02:54:08,260 --> 02:54:09,940
Oh,
so it was one of those buttons that they

4050
02:54:09,941 --> 02:54:12,730
use for that ex husband,
her ex husband,

4051
02:54:14,140 --> 02:54:17,380
Shane.
Stan had been hired by her ex touching.

4052
02:54:17,930 --> 02:54:18,763
Yeah,
that's what,

4053
02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:20,950
that's what Michael said.
That's crazy.

4054
02:54:22,090 --> 02:54:22,923
Tell us those things.
She was never convicted of being 

4055
02:54:26,260 --> 02:54:29,010
associated with it at all.
It was just indirectly anyway.

4056
02:54:29,530 --> 02:54:30,011
Well,
how could,

4057
02:54:30,011 --> 02:54:32,200
you know what,
what words were said right,

4058
02:54:32,360 --> 02:54:36,370
but crazy that someone would do that for
an ice skating competition.

4059
02:54:37,230 --> 02:54:41,030
You smashed some girl's leg.
That's it's,

4060
02:54:41,360 --> 02:54:44,470
but again,
isn't there a Texas cheerleader mom that

4061
02:54:44,471 --> 02:54:45,304
attack the other moms daughter who was 
competing with her daughter for the 

4062
02:54:49,271 --> 02:54:51,250
cheerleader that where there was even a 
few years ago,

4063
02:54:52,450 --> 02:54:55,930
maybe even killed her or just attacked 
her brutally or something like that.

4064
02:54:56,470 --> 02:54:57,570
Uh,
you might,

4065
02:54:57,740 --> 02:54:58,960
yeah.
Texas cheerleader.

4066
02:54:58,961 --> 02:54:59,710
Murdery mom.
Yeah,

4067
02:54:59,710 --> 02:55:00,543
that's it.
Oh my God.

4068
02:55:00,560 --> 02:55:02,410
Nine.
It's like a lifetime movie story kind of

4069
02:55:02,411 --> 02:55:02,680
thing.

4070
02:55:02,680 --> 02:55:03,513
Yeah.
Oh,

4071
02:55:03,620 --> 02:55:05,000
but it's real.
It's based on real sure.

4072
02:55:05,001 --> 02:55:05,834
Yeah.
They add a few things to those based on 

4073
02:55:07,311 --> 02:55:08,144
rails.
I was devastated when I found out the 

4074
02:55:09,561 --> 02:55:11,540
revenant.
The revenant wasn't real.

4075
02:55:11,600 --> 02:55:12,170
Oh,
really?

4076
02:55:12,170 --> 02:55:13,003
Oh my God.
Not only was it not real and apparently 

4077
02:55:14,241 --> 02:55:17,180
they don't even say it's real,
but everybody says it's real everybody.

4078
02:55:17,181 --> 02:55:18,014
Cause I,
I had heard the story before for my 

4079
02:55:19,401 --> 02:55:21,180
friend Steve Rinella,
who was a,

4080
02:55:21,181 --> 02:55:22,014
like a,
he's really kind of a historian on the 

4081
02:55:23,721 --> 02:55:24,554
wild west.
Get some great stories about the 

4082
02:55:25,941 --> 02:55:28,130
conflicts that she need of Americans and
settlers.

4083
02:55:28,131 --> 02:55:30,110
He knows all about the pioneers of the 
mountain men.

4084
02:55:30,350 --> 02:55:31,880
He said that that guy,
first of all,

4085
02:55:31,910 --> 02:55:35,030
the guy in that Leonardo Dicaprio played
never had a son.

4086
02:55:35,180 --> 02:55:36,013
That was one of the main motivations of 
him going after this guy that got 

4087
02:55:38,271 --> 02:55:39,830
killed.
His son didn't have a son.

4088
02:55:40,220 --> 02:55:41,053
Uh,
the only thing that was true was he got 

4089
02:55:42,231 --> 02:55:45,800
attacked by a bear and they left him to 
dad and he survived.

4090
02:55:46,160 --> 02:55:48,830
But he didn't kill anybody.
But there really were killing people and

4091
02:55:48,831 --> 02:55:50,780
survive in and the guy never killed 
anybody.

4092
02:55:50,800 --> 02:55:51,633
There really were a trappers and there 
really were native Americans and they 

4093
02:55:54,411 --> 02:55:55,820
really were bears.
Yes.

4094
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,820
All those things existed.
So it's so funny when you have a movie,

4095
02:55:58,821 --> 02:55:59,654
like then you put words in people's 
mouths and you just decide what they 

4096
02:56:02,330 --> 02:56:03,163
could've said that sounded cool.
Like they shouldn't be allowed to do 

4097
02:56:04,941 --> 02:56:06,140
that.
You know,

4098
02:56:07,220 --> 02:56:09,740
based on means we're gonna make some 
shit up.

4099
02:56:09,830 --> 02:56:11,720
Right?
Like you could Kevin Costner,

4100
02:56:11,721 --> 02:56:14,210
you could do dances with wolves cause 
you got to fake character.

4101
02:56:14,510 --> 02:56:16,010
But you know,
when you did Wyatt earp,

4102
02:56:16,040 --> 02:56:17,840
you made a bunch of shit up,
right?

4103
02:56:17,870 --> 02:56:18,703
He decided what Wyatt earp said,
how do you know we don't have a 

4104
02:56:22,011 --> 02:56:22,580
recording?

4105
02:56:22,580 --> 02:56:24,080
No,
it's all historical.

4106
02:56:24,081 --> 02:56:25,760
Recreation's like that.
It's very strange.

4107
02:56:27,360 --> 02:56:28,193
All right,
sir.

4108
02:56:28,760 --> 02:56:30,000
Did we hit the wall?
What?

4109
02:56:30,110 --> 02:56:31,070
Michael Shermer?
Yeah,

4110
02:56:31,071 --> 02:56:34,550
it's three hours and 20 minutes,
somewhere around.

4111
02:56:34,551 --> 02:56:36,030
I know that's not the record,
but uh,

4112
02:56:36,440 --> 02:56:38,090
I know your bladder is ready to give 
out,

4113
02:56:38,600 --> 02:56:40,110
but there's that.
There's that.

4114
02:56:40,230 --> 02:56:40,791
Thank you,
man.

4115
02:56:40,791 --> 02:56:41,624
Well listen,
let everybody know where they can get 

4116
02:56:42,981 --> 02:56:44,960
ahold of you,
where it can read your work,

4117
02:56:44,990 --> 02:56:47,600
where they could a skeptic.com
or Michael Shermer.

4118
02:56:47,620 --> 02:56:48,630
DICOM is,
you know,

4119
02:56:48,650 --> 02:56:49,483
the best place.
You're the first guy to ever tapped out 

4120
02:56:50,541 --> 02:56:51,380
