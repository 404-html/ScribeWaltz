1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,200
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,860
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,170
The everybody Zol Taiwan.
Is that correct way to say it?

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,040
Perfect.
Istvan.

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,750
I do it right.
Perfect.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,790
Nailed it.
Now,

7
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,270
when you're a guy who's a trans humanism
expert,

8
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,380
and you sound like a robot,
you're names.

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,890
I mean Zoltan you sound like,
oh,

10
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:35,060
like an evil robot from another planet.
I mean,

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,240
the name sounds like no one,
no insult meant no,

12
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:38,810
no,
of course,

13
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:39,480
of course.
You know,

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,720
it's,
it's a pretty bizarre name.

15
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:44,450
Esoteric in America.
Strangely enough.

16
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:47,510
It's the most common Hungarian name is a
really.

17
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:52,511
Yeah.
So like you say in a movie theater in a 

18
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:52,511
hungry,
you get five people to turn around.

19
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:52,511
So,
uh,

20
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:52,511
but,
you know,

21
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,090
in America,
yeah,

22
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:55,370
it sounds a bit.
Spend a bit spacey.

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,520
So Zoltan is like the equivalent of joe 
exact because like when someone says 

24
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:03,260
Joe,
like if you're in a crowd,

25
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,300
I assume it's someone else always.

26
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,100
There's just so many.
Damn Joe's.

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,740
So Zoltan is the Hungarian Joe.
Yeah.

28
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:10,550
And it's,
it's,

29
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,900
it's,
it's amazing.

30
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:14,330
You save on the street and you'll get 
people turning around for sure.

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,750
Now,
um,

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,620
that's,
uh,

33
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,530
it's very funny though that your name is
Zoltan and you are a trans humanism 

34
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:22,670
expert.
I mean it's,

35
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:25,740
the irony cannot be lost on you in that.
No,

36
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,430
and a lot of the median points that out 
too because uh,

37
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,060
it is,
uh,

38
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,070
you know,
I'm pushing ideas that are pretty 

39
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,040
bizarre.
There are certainly far out there and in

40
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,790
the name sort of just emphasizes that 
aspect of it.

41
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,510
What do you think when it comes to this?
So this is a very controversial subject 

42
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:47,321
because I think there's a lot of people 
that are resisting the inevitability of 

43
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:47,321
this,
uh,

44
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:50,010
this relationship that we have to 
technology the,

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,690
the continuation of this inevitable 
relationship.

46
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,450
There's a lot of people that for 
whatever reason don't like it.

47
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:58,760
They want things,
they want to go back to chopping wood.

48
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:03,761
And it just,
it seems like there's some people that 

49
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:06,260
are digging in their heels when it comes
to technological progress.

50
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,800
What do you think is like one of the big
reasons for that?

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well,
I think anything that's foreign to 

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,780
people sort of scares them.
And as human beings,

53
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,230
we have a kind of a biological 
propensity to just take our time and 

54
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,681
adapting.
And unless it's like a snake in the 

55
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:28,130
grass,
people don't react really quickly.

56
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,160
People tend to like want to take it all 
in,

57
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:32,930
discuss it with their family,
their friends,

58
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:35,510
government and whatnot.
And so we have this huge,

59
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,750
almost like I would say,
a paradigm shift about to occur where,

60
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,610
you know,
we're doing things like already starting

61
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:43,180
to put microchips in people's heads.
We're uh,

62
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,330
you know,
we can take photos from the atmosphere 

63
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,100
and look at ourselves.
It's surveillance issues.

64
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:50,780
I mean,
this is all drone use.

65
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,340
I mean,
there's a million different things going

66
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:56,060
on with technology and science and it's 
coming so fast so quickly.

67
00:02:56,061 --> 00:03:00,310
It's scaring a lot of people.
People that not normally be

68
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,310
so frightened if it was like 
individually had come at some separate 

69
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:05,920
time,
but it's just coming all at once.

70
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:06,910
And uh,
you know,

71
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:09,160
just even looking at the equipment in 
this room,

72
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,020
you know,
even 10 years ago,

73
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:13,660
a lot of this wasn't like it was.
And so,

74
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:14,110
uh,
you know,

75
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:19,111
if you're not accustomed to it or if 
you're a little bit afraid of some of 

76
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:19,660
the change you might back off from and 
say,

77
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:20,260
well,
what is this?

78
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,940
This is too weird.
But,

79
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:22,540
um,
you know,

80
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:27,541
for those of us who love it and who see 
it as very useful and functional and 

81
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,100
improving wellbeing and health,
uh,

82
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,560
this type of technology,
this type of change is,

83
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:31,780
is,
is really great.

84
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,460
Do you have any apprehensions at all 
about the,

85
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,200
the sort of exponential growth of 
technology?

86
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,470
Well,
I certainly have lots of apprehension.

87
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,380
I think the biggest thing I'm worried 
about,

88
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:46,480
and you've been hearing about this in 
the news recently is,

89
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,980
is artificial intelligence.

90
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,980
This idea that there'll be another 
entity on the planet that is smarter or 

91
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,840
smarter than us,
equal to us,

92
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,010
this kind of thing and could potentially
become so much smarter than us in such a

93
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:05,011
short time that it could literally 
literally changed the way you know,

94
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,410
our earth actually is.
And um,

95
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:13,570
I've also done a controls all the 
machines in this room and all the 

96
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:13,570
airplanes and stuff like that.
For whatever reason,

97
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,660
it could certainly stop the earth,
I'd say out or at least progress and as 

98
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,950
we know it.
Is that a good thing?

99
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,240
Is that a bad thing?
These are.

100
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,550
These are very touchy and difficult 
questions,

101
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,670
but the thing about it is certainly 
scary and that's the one thing that I've

102
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:30,220
kind of agreed with a lot of the experts
lately saying that,

103
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,760
yeah,
we probably need to have some type of 

104
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:35,760
oversight.

105
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,610
I was recently at a speaking on an 
artificial intelligence and singularity 

106
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,170
conference and that we were on a panel 
of five experts talking about ai and a,

107
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,130
someone asked,
well,

108
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,220
who is regulating artificial 
intelligence development?

109
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,520
And all the experts had no one said 
anything because no one said there 

110
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,361
really is anything regulating this idea 
that may be and potentially eight to 12,

111
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,910
probably 20 years there will be this 
entity that's smarter than us on planet 

112
00:04:59,910 --> 00:04:59,910
Earth.
That,

113
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,250
that seems a little bit of a disconnect.
I don't really like regular in 

114
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:05,250
regulatory things,
but um,

115
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,570
maybe for this one is something we'd 
have to.

116
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:10,450
So I have a lot of apprehension when it 
comes to that single concept,

117
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,280
but most of the other technologies I 
think um,

118
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,900
as long as the historically they are 
increasing life spans and are making 

119
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,551
people live better,
poverty is going down across the world 

120
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:23,551
because of technology.

121
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:23,900
So,
uh,

122
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,980
from a statistical point of view,
technology has helped and I'm pretty 

123
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,340
pretty sure it's going to continue to do
that,

124
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,060
especially if it's made kind of freely 
available to everyone.

125
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,540
It seems like there's two schools of 
thought when it comes to artificial 

126
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,360
intelligence is the Elon musk school 
where he's like,

127
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:40,990
you know,
hey,

128
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,470
we might be summoning the demon.
I mean that was his exact quote,

129
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:49,471
which is terrifying.
And then there's the other school of 

130
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:51,190
thought where people are saying like,
you don't need to worry about it because

131
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,340
they will only react in the way that we 
programmed them to react.

132
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,950
That when we create some sort of an 
artificial life form that will have very

133
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:58,250
strict

134
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,580
parameters of what it can and can't do.
You know,

135
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,300
we've seen that in science fiction 
movies before.

136
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:05,480
Like they have a protocol if they can't 
harm human beings,

137
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:06,740
you know,
they have these,

138
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,770
these things that are programmed into 
their behavior patterns that cannot be 

139
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,000
overridden.
But I think the real concern,

140
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,820
at least my real concern is that we are 
giving birth to this new superior form 

141
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:27,131
of life.
And then the way I've described it is 

142
00:06:27,131 --> 00:06:29,231
that we're essentially a caterpillar 
that doesn't recognize that it's going 

143
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:33,261
to become a butterfly.
That we are toiling away creating this 

144
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,010
ant hill or whatever we're doing.
We're.

145
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,520
We're just involved in this constant 
growth,

146
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,910
constant technological innovation 
process.

147
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,120
And we don't even realize that.
Our whole purpose here was to create 

148
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,480
this new thing was to create this new 
life form.

149
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Now.
And I'm a big proponent of that entire 

150
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,900
idea because as I point out in my,
my book,

151
00:06:56,901 --> 00:07:00,620
the transhumanist wager,
a lot of what evolution is going towards

152
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,920
is not what we think it's going or what 
we wanted

153
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,030
to go towards.
Which is,

154
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:05,440
you know,
human beings,

155
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:10,441
family,
all the institutions of marriage and 

156
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:10,441
stuff like that.
Continuing.

157
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:14,820
I actually think what evolution has 
really been leading to is the creation 

158
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,600
of a,
a really incredible superpower,

159
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,160
a,
I don't want to say God,

160
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:23,161
but something that has omnipotence,
something that is something that is 

161
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:25,840
perfect and it's in its form,
the universe just becoming alive through

162
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:27,160
us.
And,

163
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,520
you know,
we're very early in the process of that.

164
00:07:30,521 --> 00:07:31,610
I would say we're,
you know,

165
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,410
I don't know,
five,

166
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:35,830
10 percent along along the way.
We're just kind of kids in the universe.

167
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:36,950
But,
um,

168
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,280
the idea is eventually,
uh,

169
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,300
artificial intelligence and,
you know,

170
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,390
the key,
the way I worked through my apprehension

171
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:45,940
of artificial intelligence is I would 
like to merge with it.

172
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,180
I would like to have it so that we could
connect it through a neural implants or 

173
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,180
whatever it's going to be into the 
machines.

174
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,590
So it's not like the machine's leave us.
It's like we leave with the machines and

175
00:07:56,591 --> 00:08:01,591
that's the natural state of evolution.
Therefore we actually become that and 

176
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:01,591
it's like you said,
you know,

177
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:04,600
the Caterpillar idea where the butterfly
actually then becomes something else.

178
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,170
And that's where I see not only humanity
going,

179
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,450
but also,
um,

180
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,870
the,
the kind of evolutionary course of the 

181
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,551
universe which is sort of moving towards
this a much more incredible of an 

182
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:19,660
intelligence,
incredible energy forums.

183
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:22,600
Whatever it is that's going to end up.
I think we're going to end up being done

184
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,070
the most important things that humans 
don't.

185
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:24,120
Don't

186
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,120
miss the train.
I wonder if one of the things that 

187
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,840
people are concerned with is that we 
enjoy a lot of our flaws and if,

188
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,960
if we keep improving,
if technology comes along and gets to 

189
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,571
the point where a human being becomes 
free of any irrational thoughts,

190
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:47,571
free of irrational emotions are.
And maybe even any emotions we were 

191
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,070
missing out on rock and roll.
We're missing out on Charles Bukowski.

192
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,330
We're missing out on,
you know,

193
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,980
muscle,
all the stupid

194
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,980
shit that makes life fun.
It's going to be like completely 

195
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:00,980
irrelevant.
And we're not gonna.

196
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,820
No one's gonna be getting drunk.
No one's going to be making dirty jokes.

197
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,880
We're going to miss out on like fast 
food,

198
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,910
like ridiculous ice cream Sundaes.
You,

199
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:16,911
you know what I mean?
It's like there's a lot that we enjoy 

200
00:09:16,911 --> 00:09:20,030
about life that is ultimately ridiculous
and as we continue to get smarter and as

201
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:27,291
technology takes us to this point where 
we can kind of eliminate a lot of the 

202
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,700
biological protocols that are in place,
that's,

203
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:33,770
that caused these flaws,
what will we be left with will be these 

204
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,350
weird robot creatures now.
And this is one of the most,

205
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:42,351
I think,
important philosophical dilemmas of the 

206
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:44,991
kind of thing I just spoke about where 
we're evolving into some type of 

207
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:46,380
incredible intelligence is what if it's 
super boring,

208
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,490
you know?

209
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,640
And what if it's just not much fun.
You know?

210
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,920
So I think what's going to happen is 
along the way we're going to find out 

211
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,530
how much we miss.
You know,

212
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,620
somebody you said the ridiculousness of 
life,

213
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,850
you know,
I also don't know if life can actually 

214
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,381
evolve and progress just through pure 
logic or pure rationality.

215
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,790
I think chance is very important in 
life.

216
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,970
And I also think being creative and 
creative must,

217
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,030
to some extent involved.
That ridiculousness at least must 

218
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,971
involve the question of asking why now 
it might get more logical and rational 

219
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:23,691
as we go forward,
but I'm not sure we're ever going to 

220
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:25,581
completely be the perfect mathematical 
model that we would want to be A.

221
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,440
I'm not even sure that if we had perfect
intelligence,

222
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,890
if let's just say hypothetically we 
became that perfect intelligence.

223
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,570
We might purposely sabotage ourselves 
just so that we always have that element

224
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,870
of irrationality in our lives to keep us
on the go,

225
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:42,120
to keep us moving forward,
to keep us evolving.

226
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,480
So I'm.
So that's the first part of that.

227
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,850
I think the second part of what you're 
speaking about,

228
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,860
the.
The interesting thing that I always tell

229
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:51,810
people,
because I get asked this question a lot,

230
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,700
is that right now our current perception
of the universe is pretty limited.

231
00:10:56,701 --> 00:11:01,701
For example,
our ISI can only see about one percent 

232
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:03,981
of the light spectrum.
Our ears can hear far less than one 

233
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:07,101
percent of the,
of the sound waves and what's possible 

234
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:10,041
in the universe.
So our actual ability to determine what 

235
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,281
is in the universe is completely limited
and in fact so limited that were,

236
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,460
were just basically getting tiny bits of
it as we get.

237
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,920
Um,
as we progress forward,

238
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,100
I think we're going to have apps,
more applications towards getting a 

239
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,110
better perception and our senses of what
the universe really entails.

240
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,220
We'll all have night vision.
We'll have be able to see different 

241
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,511
types of gases in the air and we'll,
we'll have different types of feelings 

242
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:38,550
that are based in with this,
these kind of hypersensitive and that in

243
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:40,860
itself will give us so many new 
experiences.

244
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,970
And I try to tell this to people a lot 
that we're actually going to become much

245
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,300
more complex.
We think this is our world around us,

246
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:50,310
but actually if you and I had bionic 
eyes,

247
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,220
we'd see that there are maybe a 
different organisms

248
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,680
in this room that are also interacting 
with us.

249
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,810
And that's something that.
I'm not saying it's gonna.

250
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,170
Maybe take us down a,
either a smart or a bad path,

251
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,670
but it's something that could be 
different,

252
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:08,671
that could take us to other ideas and 
other ways of experiencing the world 

253
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:11,440
that makes it so it's not either boring 
or makes it so it's not so,

254
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:13,840
you know,
so kinda crazy though,

255
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,530
you know,
I don't think that humans are ever gonna

256
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,280
end transhumans at least to start with 
are going to give up some of the 

257
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,810
ridiculous aspects of their life because
I'm.

258
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,830
One of the things that motivates us is 
fun and one of the things in,

259
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,120
in human experience that is fun is being
ridiculous.

260
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:36,330
So I think you need that creativity.
You need that creative element in the 

261
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:36,330
species.
Yeah,

262
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,310
I agree.
I worry about the,

263
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,300
just the sheer amount of data you would 
have to process if you could see all the

264
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:46,200
gases in the air,
all the organisms that are in the air.

265
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,490
Um,
I was camping regionally in Alaska.

266
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,750
We're in a Prince of Wales,
which is a essentially a rainforest,

267
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,290
so it rains all day every day.
And uh,

268
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,410
we were in the,
um,

269
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,820
like this,
this area where it's just constant 

270
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,640
downpour,
100 percent humidity and I was in my 

271
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:05,860
tent and I turned,
I had like little headlamp on,

272
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,890
I turn the lamp on and looked in the 
tent and the tent was filled with 

273
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,031
moisture,
like little tiny droplets of dew or 

274
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:18,241
floating in the air and the entire tent.
And it made me think like,

275
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,480
if you could see all the microscopic 
particles that are in the air 

276
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:24,610
constantly,
I mean you're,

277
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,840
you're breathing in particulates,
you're breathing in all sorts of 

278
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,111
pollutants.
You're breathing in farts and gases and 

279
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:34,111
things from cars.
And,

280
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:36,160
and there's actually organisms in the 
air.

281
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,400
I mean there's,
there's codes that are spread by people 

282
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:41,400
coughing.

283
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,120
They cough.
It gets in the air and those organisms 

284
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,060
float into your body and infect you.
And that's why we tell people,

285
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:51,061
cover your mouth when you cough,
you're literally spinning out life 

286
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:51,520
forms.
And then those lifeforms contaminate.

287
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:56,521
Other people are worried that that would
be like almost too much data to process.

288
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,390
Now.
I mean,

289
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:02,490
imagine if you walk on an airplane and 
you could see everything and you see 

290
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:02,650
people coughing.
There's like,

291
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:03,720
here's the virus,
the virus,

292
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,840
you know,
you're right.

293
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:07,000
It would be a,
it would be a pretty freaky experience,

294
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,090
but I think the thing is we're probably 
at that point,

295
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:15,310
you're going to have so much connection 
either through neural implants or just 

296
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,960
some type of connection to machines that
were.

297
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,710
Our data processing is in our brain and 
however,

298
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,890
whatever kind of servers were attached 
to will allow us to make sense of it 

299
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,751
all.
Because right now I know you're saying 

300
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:30,751
it's like,
wow,

301
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:33,091
there's no way I could process it.
Life is already pretty complicated to 

302
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:33,510
process when you're going through a red 
light or run.

303
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,500
Someone's running a red light or 
something like that.

304
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,590
But hopefully in the future we'll have 
all these neuro,

305
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,670
a enhancements that will allow us to 
take that kind of stuff on and take more

306
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:45,700
of it on.
And uh,

307
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,750
you know,
there's,

308
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:52,350
there's just so much that's going to 
happen when we start increasing our 

309
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:52,350
brain power.

310
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,600
You know,
for example,

311
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,310
when they talk about artificial 
intelligence,

312
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,980
we're talking about something that could
be 10,000

313
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:02,981
times smarter than the smartest human 
being within a year to have it actually 

314
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,110
existing just through.
It's upgrading of a thousand times 

315
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,320
smarter and that's just the first year,
maybe the second or third year.

316
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,760
It's hard to know could become,
you know,

317
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,030
then thej curve takes off and that's 
where the singularity idea comes from.

318
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,300
But um,
if we're attached to that and we're able

319
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:19,610
to keep up with that,
we're able to kind of process it.

320
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,350
Then,
you know,

321
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,410
all these things we start seeing are 
going to make more sense and we'll have 

322
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:31,901
so much more capacity to understand.
I think right now when we tried to 

323
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:31,901
imagine it,
it's like wow,

324
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:36,880
way too much,
but in the future I'm hoping that our 

325
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:36,890
brains are going to be like,
you know,

326
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,750
a thousand iphones just connected.

327
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,120
And then our ability to make sense of it
all and uh,

328
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:41,660
that,
that'll,

329
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,110
I mean,
I,

330
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,120
I look forward to the day when I can see
everything will be able to see your 

331
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,441
heartbeat.
I'll be able to see right through the 

332
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:53,021
walls,
whatever people are doing in the in the 

333
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:53,021
building,
we'll hear the planes will know it,

334
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:53,930
you know everything will will see the 
airwaves.

335
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,000
Have you seen the movie lucy?
Yes.

336
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:01,030
So you know,
she starts getting to that point when 

337
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,101
she said she understands everything.
Everything is totally interconnected to 

338
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:04,970
her and she has that processing ability.
It doesn't overwhelm her.

339
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:07,760
In fact,
it kind of becomes a magical to her,

340
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:11,510
sort of like a some kind of saint or 
some kind of guru.

341
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,720
It just feels the entire universe and 
I'm hopeful that that's what it's going 

342
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,270
to be like though.
I'm not really sure.

343
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,000
You know,
that may be too optimistic,

344
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,300
but I'm hopefully will be so 
interconnected that will actually be 

345
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,451
able to be much more part of the 
universe in terms of sensing it and 

346
00:16:28,451 --> 00:16:29,300
feeling and understanding it than we are
right now.

347
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,000
That's the big concern that people have 
is when,

348
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,470
when folks,
like you say,

349
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:38,471
I'm hopeful because you know,
like you take the elan musk possibility 

350
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:41,140
the way he's describing it need to take 
what you're saying.

351
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,300
You're like,
I'm hopeful in the mosques and the 

352
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,300
demons are coming,
you know,

353
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,670
it's like,
well,

354
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,730
hopefully not.
That's that,

355
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:49,910
that concerns people,
right?

356
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,740
No,
of course.

357
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:52,280
And,
um,

358
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,090
unfortunately,
you know,

359
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:57,940
I always try to back away from any kind 
of totally qualitative or,

360
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,830
you know,
totally from statements because if I say

361
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:02,270
anything other than it's going to 
happen,

362
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,430
then all of a sudden you're this guy 
who's pegged,

363
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,110
you know,
a definite thing and the promise,

364
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:11,111
anything we're talking about in futurist
issues is always speculation to some 

365
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:11,180
extent.

366
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,680
And no one's ever really got it right.
No,

367
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:13,880
no.
And most people are wrong.

368
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,020
Um,
the question is,

369
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,750
how close are you to getting it right?
If you're at 20 percent,

370
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,650
you know,
wrong,

371
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,300
that's pretty good.
If you're 70,

372
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:21,560
80 percent wrong.
So,

373
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:26,561
you know,
futures try to attempt to speculate 

374
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:27,260
based on statistical analysis,
historical patterns,

375
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,690
what things are gonna happen and then,
you know,

376
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,840
first just throw out their ideas and,
and hope that some of them stick and 

377
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,350
occasionally one becomes totally 
accurate.

378
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:38,390
And you know,
that's the way the species moves.

379
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,800
But uh,
when I say hope,

380
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:42,120
I'm certainly not trying to pretend that
I'm,

381
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,830
the universe is going to be the way I'm 
saying it could go very wrong and it 

382
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,070
could turn out even better than,
than I'm hopeful and it could just

383
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,060
be a lot less a magical than I'm hoping,
you know,

384
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,400
I've seen some critics,
some really well educated critics.

385
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,530
I was reading this piece written by this
biologist who was criticizing the whole 

386
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:07,440
idea of transhumanism and Kurzweil in 
particular.

387
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,650
And what he was saying is that 
essentially we know so little about the 

388
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,981
human mind already and we're still just 
trying to wrap our heads around the 

389
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:20,430
processes that are going on that we're 
just beginning to understand as far as,

390
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:22,110
you know,
synapses,

391
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,990
neurons,
the where memories are stored,

392
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,200
how to manipulate them and just the 
various processes of the mind and his 

393
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,030
take on it was that it's so incredibly 
unrealistic that we'll be able to 

394
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:37,410
duplicate this by 20,
45.

395
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:39,050
Like that's the idea behind it,
right to 20,

396
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,640
45 initiative.
But my take on that,

397
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:43,530
when I was reading his,
his piece,

398
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:48,531
I was saying,
I think he's being particularly critical

399
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,900
of it because he's.

400
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,980
He's saying that what these guys don't 
understand about the human mind is that 

401
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:56,940
there's just,
there's,

402
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,910
there's always processes that go on 
behind the scenes that were,

403
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:03,960
we still don't have a handle on,
but my take on it was it,

404
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,290
we don't really have to have a hand on 
it if we can or handle on it.

405
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:12,291
If we can replicate them.
Like if they can replicate it with 

406
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,321
technology,
we don't have to know how proteins are 

407
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,691
processed and all these different 
various things that create a biological 

408
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,050
computer would,
which is essentially what the human mind

409
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:24,051
is.
It's not necessary if we can create 

410
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:25,941
something far superior and something 
that's based entirely on artificial 

411
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:29,220
intelligence and artificial technology.
Yeah.

412
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:29,960
No,
and I,

413
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,110
I'm,
you know,

414
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,470
first of all there's a lot of critics 
out there that are coming at 

415
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,330
transhumanist ideas,
futurist ideas and you just have to 

416
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,901
remember that especially in America,
about 85 percent of the people are 

417
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:48,880
religious Christians and a lot really 
that far much.

418
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,180
An ABC poll told me 83 percent was out,
I think in early 2014.

419
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,500
Do you know what the problem with that 
is?

420
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,430
I have a whole bit about this in my act 
and it's the only idiots answer polls.

421
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,020
So you're getting 83 percent of idiots.
Have you ever installed a pole?

422
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,950
No,
I have never answered a poll.

423
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:06,240
Jamie,
have you ever answered a poll?

424
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,090
They go,
I don't think most people answer polls.

425
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,050
No,
you're right.

426
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,530
And I think 83 percent seems totally 
high to me,

427
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,830
but I think even if it's a lot lower,
let's just say it's 50,

428
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:20,100
60 percent and let's just say,
you know,

429
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:23,520
there's another 10 percent that are 
various other religious ideas.

430
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:28,670
The problem is we've been kind of 
brought up in a Judaeo Christian or an 

431
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:28,820
abrahamic culture.
You know,

432
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,390
we celebrate Christmas,
Easter,

433
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,870
these are where there's so much 
religiosity and basically set into place

434
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,980
and a lot of these ideas,
you know,

435
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:41,170
transunion is one of their most 
important goals is that they want to 

436
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:41,170
live indefinitely.
That that's really the,

437
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,660
the center of a lot of the most 
important goals for the next 10,

438
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,010
20,
30 years is they don't want to die.

439
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,950
We want to use technology and science 
to,

440
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:50,680
uh,
to live.

441
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,050
At least they at least have the choice 
when we're gonna die.

442
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,090
And if that sort of flies in the face of
so much of the major,

443
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,120
the world's major religions,
because a lot of it is kind of based on 

444
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,120
you want to,
uh,

445
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,210
be a good person so you can get to that 
afterlife and have your either seven 

446
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,400
wives or whatever it is that they do.
Seventy two virgins,

447
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,290
whatever it is that they promise you.
But I'm trans humanists were like,

448
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,400
no,
actually this is perfect.

449
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,440
What we're here right now,
this,

450
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,730
this earth.
And what we'd like to do is just make it

451
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:23,731
so we don't have to leave it.
And we could stay with our families and 

452
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:26,431
we could stay with our loved ones so we 
could continue in our jobs or 

453
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:26,431
professions and stuff like that.

454
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:31,140
And that really conflicts with a lot of 
the American point of view of,

455
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:33,900
you know,
how,

456
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,320
how is it that,
uh,

457
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,850
what's gonna Happen in the future?
I mean,

458
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,030
as you probably know,
I think it's still 100 percent of people

459
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:42,130
in Congress at least are claiming their 
religious now,

460
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,580
I don't know if it's a truly 100 percent
how many are pretending,

461
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,880
but either way you still have a 
president that swears on the Bible to 

462
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,480
get his job.
These are things that fly in the face of

463
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:55,090
trans humanism.
And I think until that changes,

464
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:00,410
um,
there's going to be a huge amount of 

465
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:00,410
critics out there that are saying this 
is a,

466
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,140
this is a dangerous idea.
And um,

467
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,810
you know,
you could,

468
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,630
you can paint it a different direction.
Say,

469
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:06,310
well,
transhumanism is just a label.

470
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:09,940
It's just science and technology.
All religious people want that anyways,

471
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:11,740
you know,
or at least want some of the benefits.

472
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,070
But I think at some point there will be 
a clash because when you take death out 

473
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,250
of the picture,
a lot of the main philosophies,

474
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:23,251
a lot of the main ideologies of the 
religious religious texts fall away and 

475
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:28,051
they're not necessary anymore.
And I think that's going to create a 

476
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:28,300
pretty big conflict here in the next 
five,

477
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:33,301
10,
15 years as we climb to crawl to that 

478
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:33,790
spot where a lot of people start 
realizing,

479
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,730
wow,
we may not die.

480
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,890
We may live indefinitely.
What does that mean for,

481
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:39,610
uh,
you know,

482
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:41,740
the environment,
what does that mean for politics?

483
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:46,741
Was that mean for country?
Is globalization and stuff like that 

484
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:46,741
pop,
you know,

485
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:46,741
population as well.
So,

486
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,870
um,
I think there's going to be a lot of 

487
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,250
issues with that in the future.
And I think that's where you get a lot 

488
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:53,250
of your critics from.

489
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,710
That's fascinating because this guy that
I was talking about,

490
00:22:55,711 --> 00:22:58,120
I was not religious at all.
The biologist,

491
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,210
he's an atheist.
I think there's a lot of atheists that 

492
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,560
have issues with the possibility of 
transhumanism just as much as people who

493
00:23:04,561 --> 00:23:06,970
are religious.
But I think there's definitely something

494
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:11,971
to this idea that you know,
no one knows what happens when we die 

495
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:12,850
and that's,
that's confusing.

496
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,200
It causes a lot of conflict and we've 
sort of created placeholders for that.

497
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:19,900
We've created with religion.
We've created these.

498
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Whether you believe in religion or not.
The reality is no one truly knows what 

499
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,041
happens when we die.
If you have faith that the religious 

500
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,060
texts of your choose choosing are 
correct,

501
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:36,270
that's all well and good,
but the reality of scientific data is 

502
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,890
that there's none when it comes to what 
happens when you die.

503
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,910
There's none as far as like where did,
where did your soul word,

504
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:44,560
your personality come from?
There's none,

505
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,980
there's no data.
We have no

506
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,570
idea.
Is it nature?

507
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:50,060
Is it nurture is DNA,
is it epigenetics?

508
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,640
What creates a person's personality?
Who are you?

509
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,650
What's inside of you?
Is there a soul?

510
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,800
All of it's just pure speculation.
Is it consciousness trying to form some 

511
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,070
rational reason for your existence?
All of it's speculation.

512
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:06,370
So I think when we start talking about 
circumventing the whole reality of 

513
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:12,581
biological death,
going around it and coming up with 

514
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:12,581
something that allows you to live 
forever,

515
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:13,640
there's some people that think,
well,

516
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,540
we might be missing the whole point,
like this might be a gigantic cycle of 

517
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,700
life and death and life and death and 
continual improvement.

518
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:25,160
And just like everything else that we 
see around us,

519
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:29,060
just like our technological improvement 
is constant and consistent.

520
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,530
That might be the same thing with,
with life itself,

521
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,560
like with,
with us stepping in and stopping this 

522
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,760
process with technology in some sort of 
way,

523
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,090
we might be fucking up the whole process
of the universe.

524
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,950
The other hand.
It might be.

525
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,070
That's the whole reason why we have 
these thoughts in the first place.

526
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,200
Mike thought of us being this 
caterpillar that becomes this butterfly.

527
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,620
Our whole reason for existential angst,
our whole reason for this fear of death.

528
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:03,940
These.
I remember when I was six of seven,

529
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,980
seven years old and I was talking to my 
parents and I was asking them,

530
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:12,080
what happens when you die?
And,

531
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:17,081
uh,
my stepfather said it's probably 

532
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:17,690
nothing.
It's probably just,

533
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:21,320
you probably just die and that's it,
and I was crying.

534
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,110
I couldn't wrap my head around it,
but for a seven year old,

535
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:27,620
it's terrifying,
and I've said this before,

536
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:30,200
but I'll say it again.
Everybody likes to go to sleep,

537
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,640
but nobody wants to die and they're 
probably incredibly similar,

538
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,910
but this idea of having this impending 
end to this experience,

539
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,020
it might be one of the motivating 
factors for us to create this artificial

540
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,000
life,
to create this artificial intelligence.

541
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,240
This thing that we have that freaks us 
out worrying about death might be part 

542
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,990
of the motivation for us to transition 
into something new.

543
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,400
No,
I.

544
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:00,110
In fact I totally agree with you.
In fact,

545
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:05,470
my entire book is really based on a very
singular moment when the main character 

546
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,550
basically almost dies and he realizes 
from that point forward,

547
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:12,290
and that's what the transfer is.
A novel.

548
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,220
Yeah,
it's a novel,

549
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:18,221
but that's exactly what you've said is,
is the transhumanist wager is once you 

550
00:26:18,221 --> 00:26:20,960
realize that you could die and that's 
potentially as a seven year old child,

551
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,410
that's it.
You into something you can do about it.

552
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:29,411
Especially in the 21st century where we 
have so much science and so much 

553
00:26:29,411 --> 00:26:32,651
technology at our disposal.
Then you make this kind of wager where 

554
00:26:32,651 --> 00:26:32,651
you're saying,
you know,

555
00:26:32,651 --> 00:26:37,061
I'm actually going to dedicate my life 
to try and accomplish that because I 

556
00:26:37,061 --> 00:26:41,261
don't like it that I have to die.
And that's essentially what the 

557
00:26:41,261 --> 00:26:44,250
transhumanist wager it really is.
But I think the interesting thing

558
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,590
is that philosophical conundrum of,
well,

559
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:51,591
if we take death out of the equation,
is life as valuable as it is or are we 

560
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:55,401
messing with the mechanism of evolution 
and are we mixing with the mechanism of 

561
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:55,440
growth,
um,

562
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,990
of,
of whatever the universe is going into.

563
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,050
And I intend to.
I'm not,

564
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,470
you know,
as I've said before,

565
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:03,220
I want to live forever.
I want to live indefinitely,

566
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:08,330
but I'm not necessarily wanting to have 
it so that that's a kind of permanent.

567
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,960
I just want the choice and that's what I
think is most important.

568
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:13,840
And when I,
you know,

569
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,340
people in the transgender community,
we've actually been shying away from the

570
00:27:17,341 --> 00:27:20,880
use of the word immortality anymore 
because we've realized that a lot.

571
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,910
It's just kind of scares people.
They really think we mean in mortality 

572
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,090
and we don't necessarily what we mean is
we just want a choice on when and how 

573
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,710
we're going to live and if we're ever 
going to die,

574
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:33,480
it's under our circumstances.

575
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,220
Um,
it's on our terms and um,

576
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,250
so I,
I use indefinite lifespans,

577
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,280
uh,
a lot more because at least lets me say 

578
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,430
when I might want to end my life,
if ever.

579
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,320
And I actually wonder too,
I thought,

580
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:48,180
you know,
if you're going to live indefinitely,

581
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,060
would god potentially,
if someone was God,

582
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:54,860
would God maybe committed suicide some 
point because it's just an idea.

583
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,990
No,
you know,

584
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,490
if you were,
if you were God and you had all power,

585
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:02,820
is that something that would be the 
thing you wanted?

586
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,490
And uh,
I'm revealing like plots in my sql.

587
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:10,491
But anyways,
the idea is maybe an omnipotent entity 

588
00:28:10,491 --> 00:28:14,190
would say to,
to create a cycle of renewal.

589
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,520
I will end my existence.
I will commit suicide.

590
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,760
And uh,
and then the whole system perhaps 

591
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:22,760
restarts itself as we had talked about 
earlier.

592
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,141
You know,
maybe you create parameters in your 

593
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:27,141
existence.

594
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:27,141
So that all of a sudden you,
uh,

595
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,420
there is renewal,
there is creativity and it's out of your

596
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:31,830
control.
Sometimes you have to,

597
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,090
uh,
you know,

598
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,250
I know that for example,
day traders,

599
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,290
when they're playing stocks,
they,

600
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:42,291
um,
some of them have such problems that 

601
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:42,291
they'll purposely set their codes so 
they can't get into their account,

602
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,100
but they won't remember it.
They'll just type it in,

603
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:47,970
type it in short term memory and then 
stop it and the way they do this so they

604
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:52,971
can't trade anymore if they've been 
losing money and they having a bad day 

605
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:54,930
or something like that.
Friends of mine were doing it in college

606
00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:00,350
and I sometimes wonder if maybe a grand 
spiritual entity would do the same 

607
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,470
thing.
He would program into his own existence,

608
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,730
problems,
issues as we had talked about,

609
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,800
ridiculousness of life because that's 
something that keeps us moving forward 

610
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,930
and maybe God would even programming 
killing himself or herself or itself,

611
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:14,880
whatever.
Whoa.

612
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:15,930
That

613
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,800
is a,
that's a heady concept.

614
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:23,801
And Iowa have always wondered why it is 
that it seems like we need conflict in 

615
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:28,271
order to find resolution.
It's like I think if everybody lived in 

616
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:31,160
this perfect state of bliss and this 
Utopian existence,

617
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:36,550
we probably never get anything done and 
one of the reasons why we get things 

618
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,500
done is because we're constantly worried
about overcoming struggle.

619
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:44,710
We're constantly worried about 
overcoming potential aggressors or you 

620
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:49,801
know,
things that could go wrong and 

621
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:51,370
overcoming environmental issues that 
we've created and so we're.

622
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,010
We're coming up with technological 
solutions for those things,

623
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,720
for every new power source we come up 
with,

624
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,740
whether it's nuclear or whatever.
There's always some sort of a byproduct 

625
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,881
of that that we have to deal with and 
some sort of an effect that it's having 

626
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:09,400
on the environment that we have to 
mitigate and it seems that this constant

627
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:12,580
Yin and Yang is sort of built into the 
universe to stay.

628
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,110
I was telling you about my trip that I 
had in Alaska where I was camping in the

629
00:30:17,111 --> 00:30:20,380
rain was awful.
It was wet and cold.

630
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:22,750
It was miserable,
but when I came back to La,

631
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:27,751
I was so happy.
I called my friend Steve who took me on 

632
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:29,620
the trip and I was like,
do I have never felt better?

633
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,940
I feel fucking great.
It's like the sun feels good.

634
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:39,150
It just feels good to be driving.
It feels good to be able to go to a 

635
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:39,150
store.
You know?

636
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:43,620
There's so many things about life that 
are so amazing that I don't necessarily 

637
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:48,130
completely appreciate until I go like 
into the wilderness.

638
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:50,200
When you go into the wilderness and then
you come back,

639
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:55,201
you can really appreciate the city and I
feel like these built in struggles,

640
00:30:55,361 --> 00:31:00,361
this Yin and Yang of life is why we 
appreciate things like you don't 

641
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:04,930
appreciate really cool people unless 
you're around a bunch of assholes.

642
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:10,140
You know you don't appreciate funny 
people unless you're around people that 

643
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,111
have zero sense of humor and then you're
around funny people and they just feel 

644
00:31:13,111 --> 00:31:13,180
so good.
They warm you up.

645
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,590
It just feels fun and I really wonder if
that is.

646
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,390
I mean,
we think of it as just life.

647
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,540
These are just the realities of life,
the unfortunate realities of life and 

648
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,300
one day we're going to get our shit 
together and we won't have all those bad

649
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,680
aspects,
but is,

650
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,600
is that real?
I mean,

651
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:31,780
or is this like,
is it all just data?

652
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,960
Is it all just a part of the code?
Is it all just a part of the algorithm 

653
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,401
that moves whatever we're doing forward 
and that in that sense you need 

654
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:46,171
conflict.
It's built into the system in order to 

655
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:49,381
create entropy in order to create 
movement in order to keep everything 

656
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:53,820
going so that we eventually make that 
fucking cocoon and become that 

657
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:53,820
butterfly.

658
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:54,370
Yeah.
No,

659
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:59,371
I mean the conflict question is,
is such an age old philosophical 

660
00:31:59,371 --> 00:32:01,150
question because it's like you're always
striving for perfection,

661
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:03,700
but when you actually think about 
perfection in itself,

662
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
it doesn't sound like the thing you 
actually might want really wanted was 

663
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,120
the journey.
Right.

664
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,020
And you know,
and that's why I think they say,

665
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:11,680
well,
journey is,

666
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:13,690
you know,
most of the or half the fund at least.

667
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,790
And,
but I,

668
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:16,960
I tend to think,
you know,

669
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:20,350
as far as like from a transhumanist 
perspective since we're,

670
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:24,430
so we're,
so I think miniscule in terms of what we

671
00:32:24,431 --> 00:32:28,930
are as entities right now.
I know our brain power is a whatever,

672
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:33,070
a billion neurons or how many however 
many billion there are.

673
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:38,071
But the idea is we could create an earth
that's full of servers

674
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,440
and a,
or as I like to say in my,

675
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:42,770
uh,
in,

676
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,120
in some of my writings,
you know,

677
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:49,121
the empire state building could be 
filled with servers and that would not 

678
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:49,121
mean like waiters.
No,

679
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:50,450
no,
no,

680
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:50,990
but,
you know,

681
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:52,910
basically computer chips,
servers,

682
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:57,911
that kind of thing.
And the thing is we could create 

683
00:32:57,911 --> 00:33:00,671
something far more complex than the 
human brain and if we're tapped into 

684
00:33:00,671 --> 00:33:04,481
that and now we can get into something 
more like the death star even that's 

685
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:04,481
just filled with computer chips and 
servers,

686
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:06,440
you know,
if we get to something that huge,

687
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,240
our intelligence could be millions,
millions of times more what it is now.

688
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,710
Um,
and if that happens,

689
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:15,380
we have no idea that types of conflicts 
that would come from that.

690
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:20,590
We have no idea,
maybe the conflicts are also a million 

691
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:23,771
times greater.
Maybe conflict is something that you 

692
00:33:23,771 --> 00:33:26,531
always go through and maybe you even get
to the end of some perfect entity and 

693
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:28,490
you actually can't get in,
um,

694
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:33,680
you know,
or you get stopped by some kind of 

695
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:33,680
physical thing that could happen.

696
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:33,680
Uh,
it's so,

697
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,631
it's,
it's awesome to think about it because 

698
00:33:37,631 --> 00:33:38,000
the bottom line is from a philosophical 
perspective,

699
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,460
currently I can't see a world without 
conflict.

700
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,660
Um,
it just,

701
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:43,640
uh,
it would almost be like the world didn't

702
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:48,641
exist.
What makes it exist to us is that we 

703
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:49,190
have all these trials,
we have all these tribulations and these

704
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:52,610
things happened to us and uh,
we're happy and sad because of it and we

705
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:55,580
feel it because then we grow from it.
Um,

706
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,500
so it's hard for me to even understand 
the world,

707
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:02,501
but I think as we get more complex,
I think as we're able to tap our brains 

708
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:04,220
into mega giant machines and increase 
our intelligence,

709
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,190
it will probably become that much more 
complex.

710
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:11,000
And I think the conflicts will also 
become much more complex.

711
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,240
And um,
and so I'm not really worried about a 

712
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,240
universe,
at least in the near term,

713
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,621
at least in the next hundred years to 
300 years without any conflict because 

714
00:34:20,621 --> 00:34:21,020
the universe is still so big.

715
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,060
There's all this types of exploration in
it.

716
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,310
We have to figure out exactly what pure 
energy is,

717
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,470
will,
you know,

718
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,290
will trans human entities eventually 
transitioned into something like that?

719
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,900
Um,
and to subatomic things and whatnot.

720
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,920
And there's so much to explore.
I think it could get a,

721
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,070
I think we'll probably find that there's
more to explore than we ever thought and

722
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:44,840
will probably be just as lost in the 
universe and stuck in conflict as we are

723
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:46,940
now.
Perhaps even more so as we,

724
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:51,941
as we grow more intelligent.
And even if we do create this 

725
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:55,211
unbelievably credibly complex system of 
computers that run everything.

726
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:02,681
We've eliminated emotions and we've 
carved out this Utopian existence.

727
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,800
They're still asteroids.
They're still super volcanoes.

728
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:12,590
It's still hurricanes and tsunamis and 
earthquakes and all sorts of things that

729
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:17,660
we.
It's not even on the remote horizon.

730
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,290
US controlling natural disasters,
not even in,

731
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:26,390
not,
not even for a fraction of the natural 

732
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,530
disasters that that potentially can come
our way.

733
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:32,810
I mean we were not even considering how 
to control super volcanoes.

734
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:37,901
There's no technology so far.
There's nothing they can do and I was 

735
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:37,980
reading

736
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,980
about.
I got on this trip one night I'll do 

737
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:42,980
this and just really fucked my head up 
and I.

738
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,400
I hate doing it right before I go to 
bed,

739
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,180
but I got on this trip one night about 
super volcanoes can.

740
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:53,181
I started reading all the super 
volcanoes that exists currently and the 

741
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:58,190
reality of what has happened when those 
have gone off and there's one in 

742
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,971
Indonesia that they believe there's a 
lot of people that have pointed to as 

743
00:36:01,971 --> 00:36:06,081
the possibility of why all humans can be
traced back to original ancestors.

744
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,270
That they think that this one,
that blue somewhere.

745
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:14,271
I believe it was like 75,000
plus years ago that they think that when

746
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:20,481
this fucker went off,
it killed most of the people on the 

747
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:20,880
planet.
It's an Indonesia incident,

748
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,590
enormous,
bigger than yellowstone,

749
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:27,950
and they think that the remaining few 
people repopulated the earth and that 

750
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,700
the seven plus billion people are 
directly related to a 70,000

751
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:33,270
years ago.

752
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,390
The survivors of this super volcano.
That's crazy and that's terrifying.

753
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:43,670
And if that happens again,
there's not a damn thing we could do 

754
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:47,271
about it right now.
We're constantly worrying about getting 

755
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:50,121
faster Wifi and make it an electric car 
that go more than 300 miles without a 

756
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:55,011
recharge.
But the reality of natural disasters is 

757
00:36:55,011 --> 00:36:58,641
there's always that nature reset button 
and that nature reset button could come 

758
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:02,850
in the form of a five mile wide rock 
that slammed into the Yucatan and killed

759
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:07,851
all the dinosaurs or that gigantic super
volcano in Indonesia that killed off who

760
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:14,271
knows what percentage of the population,
but they think it could be as much as 

761
00:37:14,271 --> 00:37:15,960
like killed off everybody.
But for a thousand people,

762
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:19,500
that's a real possibility that's being 
bandied about.

763
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:22,650
And that's something that we're not 
going to be able to stop.

764
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,500
No,
no,

765
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,390
definitely.
You know,

766
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:26,850
I,
uh,

767
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,020
about two months ago created a,
the transhumanist party,

768
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:35,260
which is the kind of first political 
organization about it and the third we 

769
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,800
had three main goals and the first is 
try to make it so that everyone can live

770
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:41,930
indefinitely.
The second one is just a spread,

771
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,260
a kind of a general,
like we want people to think positively 

772
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,020
when they think of technology and 
science set of being so critical.

773
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:53,021
But the third one deals with existential
risks and it amazes me that we spend so 

774
00:37:53,331 --> 00:37:58,331
much money at a walmart or Mcdonald's or
going to Disney land when we have 

775
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:01,820
problems like a super volcano that 
exists.

776
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,920
Things that if you think about at late 
at night,

777
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,950
it keeps you up because it's so 
horrific.

778
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,680
And what's amazing about is that it's 
not just super,

779
00:38:09,681 --> 00:38:10,250
okay,
it's,

780
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,700
we've had existential risks facing the 
planet for,

781
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,990
you know,
they've happened,

782
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:15,950
we know they've happened.

783
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:20,300
We can see that they've happened.
And still we send such a small amount of

784
00:38:20,301 --> 00:38:23,600
government budgets towards protecting 
the species as a whole.

785
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,840
When you know,
you would think from an existential risk

786
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:31,841
point of view,
it would be the first thing you would 

787
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:31,841
probably tackle.
Uh,

788
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:32,180
I actually thought this sort of with 
Ebola,

789
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:32,710
I thought,
you know,

790
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,490
I can't believe that we don't a 
$100,000,000

791
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:38,470
and wipe it out.
Why don't we just as a,

792
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:40,030
as a world,
get together and do it.

793
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:41,250
It's not like we're,
you know,

794
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,870
we're worth 200 to 400 trillion.
They say the,

795
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,850
the world and it would probably take 50 
or 100 million to,

796
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,060
to wipe out the disease.
Why don't we do it?

797
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,670
Why don't we wipe out malaria?
Why don't we map out the things?

798
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,490
Is it really that simple though?
It's probably not that simple,

799
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:58,780
but no one's tackled it in with more 
than a fraction of that amount.

800
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,900
And I think if you actually put the 
world's best scientists together and 

801
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:03,900
really said,
you know what,

802
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,010
some things really are scary for the 
human race.

803
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,160
This is something that we need to go out
there and attack first before it gets 

804
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,280
out of control.
And um,

805
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:17,620
I just,
I find it always so strange that 

806
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,420
governments don't treat this seriously 
and I think it's because as a politician

807
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:24,421
you can't because it sounds so far 
fetched to talk about a five mile wide 

808
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:25,960
asteroid hitting the earth.
It sounds like.

809
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:26,350
Yeah,
yeah,

810
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:31,351
I'll worry about that tomorrow.
But the reality is as soon as something 

811
00:39:31,351 --> 00:39:31,360
like that happens or a title wave 
happens,

812
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:33,820
for example,
in kills so many people,

813
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,010
um,
a few years back,

814
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:41,220
then you start thinking about that.
I think it always takes like some kind 

815
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,090
of giant cataclysmic disaster to 
actually get people to say,

816
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:48,150
today I'm putting my money where my 
mouth is and we're going to actually go 

817
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,150
out and try to stop some of these 
things.

818
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,070
And like you said,
it was super volcanoes.

819
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:54,250
There's nothing we can do,
but certainly with asteroids and stuff 

820
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:54,460
like that,
there are some things that we can do.

821
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:56,010
And certainly with diseases,
uh,

822
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,550
there are things we can do.
And I'm,

823
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,340
I'm kind of a,
you know,

824
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:05,341
I'm always bummed out because I feel 
like our governments don't treat the 

825
00:40:05,341 --> 00:40:08,350
risk to the species seriously enough.
They treat,

826
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,000
you know,
social security,

827
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:12,210
tax issues and this kind of stuff,
you know,

828
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:17,230
it covers the headlines,
but what's really important for the 

829
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:17,230
species,
for all seven,

830
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,510
almost 8 billion of us soon,
is a,

831
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,940
is making sure that we don't all go the 
way of the dinosaurs and that just takes

832
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:24,740
a matter of money and putting some of 
the best minds to insane.

833
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,760
Let's just.
Whatever it is that you guys and girls 

834
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:29,760
need to do,
just please do it.

835
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,980
The malaria one is terrifying.
I was listening to radio lab.

836
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:35,380
You have to listen to that podcast.
I haven't,

837
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:37,300
but I've heard the name.
It's a brilliant,

838
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,590
brilliant podcast that,
uh,

839
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:41,260
I think it's put out by NPR.
I think those are the folks who do it,

840
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,540
but it,
um,

841
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,760
they had an episode where they were 
talking about mosquitoes and they were 

842
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,361
talking about malaria and they said that
half of the people that have died ever 

843
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:53,890
since people have been around,
were killed by malaria.

844
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,200
I've,
I've had malaria and malaria.

845
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,910
I've had a whole bunch of God when I was
20.

846
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:03,370
I did this a long sail trip.
And,

847
00:41:03,371 --> 00:41:04,150
uh,
as a result,

848
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:07,180
I got a whole bunch of stuff like a 
hepatitis,

849
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:12,010
a dandy fever and malaria,
Dang fever and malaria.

850
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:17,340
I had it all at various places.
And so I spent about four months in the 

851
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:17,380
Solomon Islands,
uh,

852
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:22,381
and,
but I also kind of went through the 

853
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:22,630
North Pacific Ocean after the South 
Pacific and basically on a sailboat,

854
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:27,660
you're just,
you're going to get it unless you're 

855
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,611
taking.
And I was even taking prophylactic a 

856
00:41:29,611 --> 00:41:30,460
malaria pills when I got malaria,
but,

857
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:31,160
um,
it,

858
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,650
it,
it doesn't always work.

859
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,070
There's more than chloroquine that

860
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,060
you needed.
You needed math,

861
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:40,061
mcqueen and whatnot.
And the problem is they gave me crazy 

862
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:41,100
nightmares so I didn't take the proper 
prophylactics,

863
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,490
but I eventually got it,
went and tested there,

864
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,350
and then just sat on my boat for three,
four days.

865
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:47,660
And then I did a methlick when treatment
for malaria,

866
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:50,690
which is essentially,
you take four tablets times three days.

867
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:55,691
So you take 12 altogether.
And I don't know if you know anything 

868
00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:55,691
about Larry or mefloquine,
but it gives you an,

869
00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:58,490
it makes you hypersensitive.
So when you look at a sunset,

870
00:41:58,491 --> 00:42:02,240
you get incredibly emotional and it's 
like a great thing to write poetry on,

871
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,150
but it totally messes with you,
which is why a lot of people,

872
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:06,730
at least when I was sailing 10 years 
ago,

873
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,570
tried not to take it as a prophylactic.
But um,

874
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,960
so it worked.
I got rid of it.

875
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,200
I was,
I was an able body 22 year old person.

876
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:17,900
So you're pretty much able to go through
a lot of things.

877
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:23,260
But um,
I have been around a number of villages 

878
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,561
in that trip where people have died.
Children die all the time and I still,

879
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:32,380
I'm not sure what the numbers are,
but I think it's a 715 million people 

880
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,700
maybe are still dying from malaria a 
year or have died in the last.

881
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:35,390
I don't know,
something.

882
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,220
Something crazy.
When you think about it,

883
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,060
you,
you think,

884
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,710
wow,
why don't we just go out there?

885
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,430
I mean this is why Bill Gates is 
targeted.

886
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,120
This is one of his main initiatives with
his,

887
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,280
his incredible wealth is to say,
God,

888
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:51,281
this,
this is one thing we could literally 

889
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:53,260
just take out 627,000
malaria deaths this year.

890
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,660
Yeah.
Whoa.

891
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:57,650
Yeah.
I mean it's,

892
00:42:57,651 --> 00:42:58,190
it's,
uh,

893
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,240
it's,
it's a huge amount when you think about 

894
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,240
in terms of it's far more than war.

895
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,430
It's,
it's far more than anything else.

896
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:06,980
And think of like,
so we spent all this money on war.

897
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,000
We could,
you know,

898
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,350
take a little bit of that budget and pr.
You know,

899
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,570
UNICEF has a different number.
They say over a million.

900
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,950
UNICEF says over a million people die of
malaria every year.

901
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,550
Wow.
So many.

902
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:28,090
It causes 300 to $500,
million infections and over a million 

903
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,050
deaths.
This is John Hopkins also says that.

904
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,630
So I'm assuming it's probably somewhere 
around a million.

905
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,120
I think when you're dealing with 
impoverished countries,

906
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:38,390
right?
It's very difficult to keep track of how

907
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:40,970
many people know too.
And I think a lot of the people were.

908
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,930
I got,
it was,

909
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,720
there was no telephone in this village.
There was no anything,

910
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:48,080
I was just anchored off there at a surf 
spot and um,

911
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:53,740
and I must have gotten it through the 
time that I was sailing through some of 

912
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:53,740
these outer islands.

913
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,000
And uh,
there's uh,

914
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:59,020
you know,
maybe once a week there's a boat that 

915
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,851
comes through with supplies,
but that's why people die from it 

916
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:03,641
because there's really nothing there 
except the basic drugs to take care of 

917
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,050
it and it doesn't always work and stuff 
like that.

918
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:08,110
And there's variations of it as well.
So.

919
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,630
So some people try to just ride it out 
and not take the drugs because they make

920
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:13,640
you so wacky.
Well some people actually,

921
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:16,520
once they get it are too weak to walk 
into the clinic.

922
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,650
So like in the Solomon Islands for 
example,

923
00:44:18,651 --> 00:44:22,220
it's just filled with these giant,
a giant mountains,

924
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:25,100
but there's a lot of hills and so you 
have to Kinda cross ravines.

925
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:27,800
And I was so out.
I mean I could barely even get up.

926
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:32,801
I didn't really eat.
I just could drink water and I kind of 

927
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:32,801
laid in my bed all day.

928
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:34,350
And so if you have it and you're an 
adult,

929
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,540
you either have to send your kids to get
it,

930
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,720
but you weren't,
you're not going be able to climb a 

931
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,810
couple miles to go get the medication.
And so if you live in some outer tribe,

932
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,740
away from a clinic and most assault,
there's,

933
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:49,900
I dunno,
a couple hundred islands in the Solomon 

934
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:49,900
Islands.
No one has access to the same thing with

935
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,170
Papa New Guinea.
There's not a huge amount of tribes,

936
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:57,770
but if you actually try to get anywhere,
it's all highlands full of snakes and 

937
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:02,810
whatnot.
So even across a mile and that kind of 

938
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:05,211
territory is pretty tough stuff.
So if you have to go 20 miles to get 

939
00:45:05,211 --> 00:45:06,150
pills,
it might just be safer to take your bat,

940
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:11,360
not use all your energy and uh,
and try to ride it out so your immune 

941
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,480
system is capable of your healthy young 
22 year old of surviving.

942
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,130
And sometimes I think it's just luck.
So for example,

943
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:20,190
I was already on a chloric when at the 
time,

944
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,070
so I already had some resistance to 
certain type of,

945
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,890
uh,
uh,

946
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,020
malaria.
Oh I see.

947
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,130
But once I had tested for it,
because I got basically got feverish and

948
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:32,340
all this and I went and tested before I 
was got really bad and they said,

949
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:34,200
yeah,
it looks like you have it at this little

950
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:35,580
clinic.
And uh,

951
00:45:35,581 --> 00:45:40,581
so,
and I was too far away to sail to 

952
00:45:40,581 --> 00:45:40,581
anywhere.
And um,

953
00:45:40,581 --> 00:45:43,740
at the time I didn't have any real 
services to be air evacuated out.

954
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,400
And also,
you know,

955
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,890
I had been sailing three,
four years already.

956
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:48,450
You don't,
you can't leave your trip.

957
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:53,451
I had a whole bunch of incidences.
You can't leave your boat every time 

958
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:53,451
something goes wrong you just got to 
deal with it.

959
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,630
And so I just went back and took this 
lithium treatment and so I,

960
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,560
I had the cure for it.

961
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:03,590
And the cure is a,
at least in the Solomon Islands at the 

962
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:06,111
time was you take this regimen of 
laurium 12 tablets over three days and 

963
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:07,140
that should,
that should take care of it.

964
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,210
What a crazy trip you went on,
man,

965
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:09,690
you,
you,

966
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:12,150
you sail for three or four years?
So No,

967
00:46:12,151 --> 00:46:15,030
I sail for around seven.
Yeah.

968
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:16,710
And it was a left from,
uh,

969
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:21,770
from Los Angeles,
Santa Barbara or Los Angeles and went 

970
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,811
through the South Pacific,
spent four years there and continue to 

971
00:46:23,811 --> 00:46:24,400
end across the Indian Ocean and,
uh,

972
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,900
a Mediterranean.
So I've done some crazy stuff.

973
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:32,901
A lot of that stuff was when I was 
working for the National Geographic 

974
00:46:32,901 --> 00:46:33,960
Channel,
so I was kind of set up where I would go

975
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:38,961
and do short three to five minutes.
I'm kind of filler documentaries in 

976
00:46:38,961 --> 00:46:40,950
between the longer segments of a new 
show that they had.

977
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:44,640
And uh,
so I'd stop places and film and um,

978
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:46,830
and I'd create these three to five 
minute news pieces.

979
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,590
So it's really fun stuff.
Did some crazy,

980
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,420
crazy,
a fun stories,

981
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,020
but,
you know,

982
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,210
a weird stuff.
Yeah,

983
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:59,211
I would imagine that would be an insane 
life of adventure all those years on a 

984
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,140
sailboat.
Just sail it around.

985
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:01,780
And,
and,

986
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:04,490
and in the South Pacific as well.
Uh,

987
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:09,790
you know,
the South Pacific was the best part 

988
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:09,790
because I,
uh,

989
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:12,950
I wasn't working at the time.
It was later that I started actually 

990
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:12,950
working and doing the national 
geographic stuff.

991
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,550
And um,
that was great too,

992
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:17,370
but the South Pacific,
I was just there with about 500 bucks.

993
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,430
I spent literally four years in the 
South Pacific,

994
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,530
including the time I was at the 
Solomons.

995
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:27,531
The Solomons is,
starts getting into the North Pacific 

996
00:47:27,531 --> 00:47:27,531
and A.
Yeah,

997
00:47:27,531 --> 00:47:28,230
what a wonderful time.
I was 21,

998
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:33,231
just finished school,
was sailing around and a half reading 

999
00:47:33,231 --> 00:47:33,231
books on the ocean.
Yeah,

1000
00:47:33,231 --> 00:47:36,400
a couple of times I had girlfriends come
with me for a month or two.

1001
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,400
And so it was really like a,
I was a surfer and I was a paraglider 

1002
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,230
and uh,
so I would do just all sorts of 

1003
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:46,230
activities all the time and spear 
fishing.

1004
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:50,380
I was what a lie was hard to talk about 
because it's like I have kids now and 

1005
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,611
I'm married and house and all that.
So I'm probably can never go back to the

1006
00:47:53,981 --> 00:47:58,981
days of youth I wandering around in the 
Pacific sailing going by the wind.

1007
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,940
Oh,
glorious.

1008
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,320
Yeah.
So it was a,

1009
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:10,321
those were the days.
That's kind of the opposite of 

1010
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:10,321
transhumanism though,
isn't it?

1011
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:10,321
It,
it,

1012
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:11,650
it is.
And um,

1013
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,500
and I was very low tech at the time,
you know,

1014
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:16,800
when I first started sailing,
they didn't even have gps.

1015
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:21,950
We,
I used a sextant for the first few 

1016
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:23,521
years.
You use one of those crazy Christopher 

1017
00:48:23,521 --> 00:48:23,521
Columbus thing.
That's all they had.

1018
00:48:23,521 --> 00:48:26,470
Only the military had access to the GPS 
system then.

1019
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:29,110
So no one private people weren't allowed
to travel yet.

1020
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:34,650
I had a GPS system on my phone or my car
that was cd rom driven and it was in,

1021
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:42,780
I want to say the early two thousands or
maybe even the late nineties,

1022
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:48,930
it was somewhere around 2000 ish and I 
got one of the first ones and it was 

1023
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:53,341
such an inaccurate piece of shit and it 
was really slow and it was only good for

1024
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:55,900
California.
Like I had a stick.

1025
00:48:55,901 --> 00:49:00,570
The CD in there was a slot that it would
go into it.

1026
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:04,540
It's so hard to imagine a world where 
gps didn't exist.

1027
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:09,690
I know,
let alone be on a boat traveling around 

1028
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,520
the world on this boat with no gps.
That to me,

1029
00:49:12,521 --> 00:49:14,250
it's just incredible.
Oh,

1030
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,580
it was,
it was really.

1031
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:16,720
It was fun.

1032
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,760
And the sex thing is so awesome because 
you actually use the stars to navigate 

1033
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,560
same stars.
We teach kids to my daughters.

1034
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:24,790
I'll point out and be like,
you know,

1035
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:27,970
and the whole life was so magical.
I mean,

1036
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:29,680
it's still cool.
I love what I'm doing now.

1037
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:34,681
But there was something much more a 
human and a just youthful about that 

1038
00:49:36,161 --> 00:49:38,290
entire period of my life.
Human.

1039
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,230
Isn't that a strange word that you just 
used?

1040
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:45,320
I'm not sure.
What is your whole thing is 

1041
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,570
transhumanism and you're talking about 
this incredibly low tech adventure as 

1042
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,180
being one of the highlights of your 
life.

1043
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,360
So I'll tell you exactly how that 
switched.

1044
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,160
After most of the sail trip,
I was actually covering a story in 

1045
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,540
Vietnam for nationals for the National 
Geographic Channel.

1046
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,280
We were covering a story on bomb 
diggers.

1047
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:07,240
And uh,
what did they do is,

1048
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:10,120
and there's about,
I think five to 15,

1049
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,020
10 percent.

1050
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:16,020
It's hard to know exactly,
but at least five percent of the 

1051
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,440
American bombs dropped by America in 
Vietnam never exploded.

1052
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:22,650
So what you have is you have millions of
tons of metal lying around the jungles 

1053
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,250
just sitting there,
overgrowth is all around them,

1054
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:27,650
and in most of the rice farmers market 
make a dollar a day.

1055
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,570
So ultimately what's happened is a huge 
community of farmers have said,

1056
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,520
well,
why don't we salvage the metal,

1057
00:50:34,521 --> 00:50:39,521
sell the metal,
and will make 10 times what we would 

1058
00:50:39,521 --> 00:50:41,810
make in a season in farming.
The problem is that the DMZ,

1059
00:50:41,811 --> 00:50:46,811
the demilitarized zone,
quite a bit of parts of Vietnam are 

1060
00:50:46,811 --> 00:50:48,070
filled with landmines and dealing with 
these unexploded bomb.

1061
00:50:48,071 --> 00:50:51,380
Some them that as long as this table are
about pretty close to it,

1062
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,680
um,
are incredibly dangerous because you 

1063
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:56,840
have to dismantle it and take the metal 
to a dealer in the city and whatnot.

1064
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,380
So a lot of the bomb hunters,
what they call themselves,

1065
00:51:00,381 --> 00:51:02,270
and there might be 10,000
of them in Vietnam,

1066
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,370
um,
ended up losing their lives,

1067
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:08,240
are losing their legs on landmines.
And so I went to cover the story because

1068
00:51:08,241 --> 00:51:10,130
it's an awesome story,
totally fascinating.

1069
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,180
But,
um,

1070
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:15,500
I had a very close incident on one of my
final days when I was,

1071
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:20,501
I'm covering the story,
cameron hand is my guide came from 

1072
00:51:20,501 --> 00:51:24,611
behind me.
We were walking on a trail guide came 

1073
00:51:24,611 --> 00:51:26,831
from behind me.
I stepped off the trail to look at an 

1074
00:51:26,831 --> 00:51:27,710
impression because the way you can tell 
where these unexploded bombs came,

1075
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:30,920
is that a part of the jungle,
there's an impression in the,

1076
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:35,921
uh,
in the earth and that he came and 

1077
00:51:35,921 --> 00:51:35,921
tackled me and I said,
dude,

1078
00:51:35,921 --> 00:51:35,921
I'm holding my camera,
you know,

1079
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,090
so we all went down and then he pointed 
out,

1080
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,140
he said,
look right here.

1081
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:44,270
And in the ground there was this like 
little silver thing and a little black 

1082
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,430
thing actually.
And he said,

1083
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,690
we probably a landmine and you almost 
stepped on it.

1084
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:48,700
And,
uh,

1085
00:51:48,701 --> 00:51:50,930
I just kinda sat there and I thought,
wow,

1086
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,050
that's a little too freaky for me.
After I had already,

1087
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:56,300
like in the years proceeding this,
I'd had a,

1088
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:00,320
all my diseases on the sailboat.
I had been to a number of war zones.

1089
00:52:00,321 --> 00:52:01,240
I just,
uh,

1090
00:52:01,241 --> 00:52:05,840
about a year earlier had a huge kind of 
bunch of incidents in the cashmere,

1091
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:08,060
a Indian Pakistan conflict,
which I covered.

1092
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,340
I did a humanitarian kind of war peace 
there,

1093
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,470
and I was the,
the,

1094
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:16,540
the,
the landmine incident was the one that 

1095
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,461
sort of in my brain said human to 
transhuman and I thought I'm not doing 

1096
00:52:19,101 --> 00:52:22,340
dangerous things anymore.
Actually went home after the incident.

1097
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:23,320
It just,
there was some,

1098
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:24,680
there was a shook you up that much.

1099
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,110
It was like a philosophical bomb went 
off in my head and I said,

1100
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:27,570
you know what,
I'm,

1101
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:32,740
I'm 28 years old.
I've been doing crazy things for huge 

1102
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,320
amounts of time and getting very lucky.
Um,

1103
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,930
I was working at a nonprofit 
organization,

1104
00:52:38,931 --> 00:52:43,931
Cambodia called wildaid and we were 
doing undercover work to busting 

1105
00:52:43,931 --> 00:52:43,931
poachers,
you know,

1106
00:52:43,931 --> 00:52:45,040
we were literally,
um,

1107
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,180
I'd go with a team of militia.
Uh,

1108
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:52,560
we were a nonprofit and we'd go into 
places and free live animals that had 

1109
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,400
been confiscated for food and we'd,
you know,

1110
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:59,530
literally arrest the poachers because 
they have China and Cambodia have this 

1111
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:01,430
illegal poaching system.
But it was,

1112
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:06,530
it was like I had just come from about a
month of doing that and it was like a 

1113
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:06,530
little bit too much for me.
All.

1114
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:08,550
It was just too much danger,
too much hecticness.

1115
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,420
So the landmine incident was the one in 
my mind that changed it.

1116
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:16,630
And I said I went home.
That's when I essentially began working 

1117
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:17,780
on the book and I'm the transcripts 
wager,

1118
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:19,910
which has sort of launched me into this,
uh,

1119
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,520
this public career of promoting 
transhumanism.

1120
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:27,521
I'd always been a transhumanist as 
someone wants to use technology and 

1121
00:53:27,521 --> 00:53:31,551
science to upgrade myself.
But this was the time that I made it 

1122
00:53:31,551 --> 00:53:31,920
personal.
This is the time that I said,

1123
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:32,720
you know,
I'm,

1124
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,090
I'm done having fun and just writing 
journalistic stories.

1125
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:39,930
I'm now going to actually dedicate my 
life to something that means a lot to me

1126
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,750
because I don't want to ever have to be 
facing death.

1127
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,540
The landmines certainly would have 
killed me,

1128
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:47,610
I think,
or at least made me to such a.

1129
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:52,530
You almost always lose legs and it's 
just a little too much for me.

1130
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:57,531
So I came back and that's sort of how my
career of the church trajectory of 

1131
00:53:57,531 --> 00:53:59,940
transhumanism for me took onto this 
quite public

1132
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:02,090
roll.
Wow.

1133
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:05,260
Wow.
That is,

1134
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:08,600
first of all,
it's incredibly terrifying to think that

1135
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:11,810
there's that many landmines still in 
Vietnam.

1136
00:54:11,811 --> 00:54:14,840
I've read that before and I kind of put 
it aside,

1137
00:54:14,841 --> 00:54:18,530
I guess in the back of my mind,
but those poor people that lived there,

1138
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,850
I mean the Vietnam War is just such an 
unbelievably fucked up time in history,

1139
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:28,150
but it's so incredible how peaceful the 
Vietnamese are and how forgiving and 

1140
00:54:29,121 --> 00:54:34,100
accepting the Vietnamese people are 
about us invading or oh,

1141
00:54:34,101 --> 00:54:35,450
I shouldn't say us.
You know,

1142
00:54:35,451 --> 00:54:40,451
the,
the troops of the 19 sixties and 

1143
00:54:40,451 --> 00:54:41,900
seventies invading Vietnam and all the 
horrific things that happened there.

1144
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:47,470
But that,
that the fact that no one's freaking 

1145
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:50,321
out,
but there's that many bombs that just 

1146
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:50,321
occasionally go off and kill some poor 
farmer.

1147
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:54,990
I know.
I think America should go in there and 

1148
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:54,990
clean it up,
you know,

1149
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:55,890
because it's ridiculous.
The amount of bombs that are.

1150
00:54:55,891 --> 00:55:00,300
There are such a staggering number.
You could never cleared up with 10,000

1151
00:55:00,301 --> 00:55:02,370
Vietnamese farmers who have given up 
their fields,

1152
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:03,060
and again,
it's,

1153
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:06,810
it's happening all over the country now 
in Cambodia and Laos bomb diggers are,

1154
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,570
it's an entire culture,
mostly young kids.

1155
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,780
And a lot of my documentary was on 
actually filming the amputees that lost 

1156
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,170
their legs or arms when something went 
wrong.

1157
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:21,350
And your viewers can watch this,
the national geographic video still up 

1158
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:21,880
on this one.
It's called,

1159
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,220
um,
I think it's just,

1160
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:27,660
you would google old Istvan Slash 
Vietnam and go to youtube and it'll,

1161
00:55:27,661 --> 00:55:29,050
it'll appear.
Um,

1162
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,020
it's,
it's called bomb diggers I think,

1163
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,710
but are just Vietnam,
just a,

1164
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:36,050
it's a four minute clip,
but it shows like,

1165
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,140
you know,
what,

1166
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:39,540
what these people go through on a daily 
basis.

1167
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:44,540
I just go out with a shovel.
They go out with metal detectors and 

1168
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:44,540
they're like,
d.

1169
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,620
and every step they take is out for a 
whole week.

1170
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:51,621
I was freaked out.
It was like [inaudible] the DMZ is just 

1171
00:55:51,621 --> 00:55:52,050
filled with.
No one's been there.

1172
00:55:52,051 --> 00:55:57,051
There's no villages in that immediate 
area because it's just too dangerous to 

1173
00:55:57,051 --> 00:55:57,500
live some people,
you know.

1174
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,840
So there's thousands of those thousands 
and thousands and what's worse is that 

1175
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:08,001
bomb digging a is attracting a younger 
generation and they make so much more 

1176
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:10,620
money than rice farming,
like literally a 100 times.

1177
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:15,740
If you find one six foot balm,
you can feed your family for a year and 

1178
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,790
you could find in one day.
So in one day's worth of work,

1179
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,190
you can make more than you could in an 
entire season.

1180
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:20,950
So the

1181
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,710
bomb is just the metal of the bomb or 
the bomb itself.

1182
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:24,580
Unexploded.

1183
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,720
It's no,
it's just the metal.

1184
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:30,721
They dismantle it and they sell the 
metal that because they're only making 

1185
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:30,760
$1 a day in their farming.
So it's.

1186
00:56:30,761 --> 00:56:32,260
So they're so poor,
you know,

1187
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,670
and they're very like,
you're right.

1188
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:38,671
You nailed it.
The totally nice people and they were 

1189
00:56:38,671 --> 00:56:38,671
happy to help me with my story.
Um,

1190
00:56:38,671 --> 00:56:39,150
but,
uh,

1191
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:39,940
there,
uh,

1192
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:44,080
the whole thing is so bizarre.
That's incredible.

1193
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,870
And what do they do?
How do they dismantle these things?

1194
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:50,410
So they have experts.
If they find a big one,

1195
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:52,640
they carried into their village and this
is another problem.

1196
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,760
They fucking pick it up.
Yes,

1197
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:59,770
yes,
that's the whole problem and then they 

1198
00:56:59,770 --> 00:56:59,770
hammer it apart.
It's just,

1199
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:03,691
yeah,
it's crazy and sometimes like half 

1200
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:05,851
villages go up when they make a mistake.
This has been a problem that's happened 

1201
00:57:05,851 --> 00:57:07,990
in Laos is the like,
so yeah,

1202
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:13,030
it's a couple of documentaries have now 
been made since I did this and I think 

1203
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,390
in 2002,
2003,

1204
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,720
but a couple of real documentaries 
because now they're a nonprofit 

1205
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:18,720
dedicated to saying,
hey,

1206
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,040
don't go bomb digging that you might 
make a fortune in a day.

1207
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,330
You might change your,
you know,

1208
00:57:22,331 --> 00:57:23,560
your,
your family,

1209
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:26,620
your wealth of your family,
but it's not worth it because look,

1210
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,570
every,
for every 10 people that go out,

1211
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,960
two or three end up with amputees or 
some end up completely dead and stuff 

1212
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,040
like that and so much more dangerous 
than just farming.

1213
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:41,230
And has there been any effort whatsoever
by the United States government to go in

1214
00:57:41,231 --> 00:57:42,790
there and clean it up?
You know?

1215
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:46,150
So I did the story a long time ago and 
that point there wasn't much.

1216
00:57:46,151 --> 00:57:48,820
They just gave a lot of,
I think money to make up for it.

1217
00:57:48,821 --> 00:57:50,710
But I actually don't know what's going 
on now.

1218
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:53,650
I know that the nonprofits had been 
working on trying to get them money.

1219
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,400
God just so it's so hard to think about 
it.

1220
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:03,500
It's so hard to think that you're not 
responsible for all the bombs that you 

1221
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:03,500
left behind.

1222
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,860
That wouldn't be one of the first things
the United States deals with.

1223
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:10,120
And how difficult would it be to do a 
sweep of the entire country and find all

1224
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:13,090
the bombs with the problem is like in 
the area,

1225
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,000
the DMZ is all pretty big hills,
so it,

1226
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:22,001
it's almost,
you couldn't be able to get tractors up 

1227
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:24,121
there.
It's just there's too much vegetation 

1228
00:58:24,121 --> 00:58:24,160
and everything's overgrown so nobody 
knows what to do.

1229
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:27,830
It would be much easier just to throw a 
lot of money at it and uh,

1230
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,320
and try to,
you know,

1231
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,400
get the UN or somebody to go in there 
and sweep through it with metal 

1232
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:34,840
detectors.
Yeah.

1233
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:36,310
But what the fuck man?
I mean,

1234
00:58:36,311 --> 00:58:41,311
how,
how is it possible that they have just 

1235
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:41,311
left all that shit there?
That's just what,

1236
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:43,960
that's so dark.
They bomb so much of the country.

1237
00:58:43,961 --> 00:58:46,030
It's really like,
it's such a staggering,

1238
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,690
it just when you actually study the 
numbers of how much they dropped,

1239
00:58:49,691 --> 00:58:50,650
I think they drop more.

1240
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:54,550
I'm not 100 percent of this fact,
but I believe they dropped more bombs in

1241
00:58:54,551 --> 00:58:59,551
Vietnam than all other wars or something
like that combined of the amount of 

1242
00:58:59,551 --> 00:59:03,360
bombs and because at the time that's all
they did and um,

1243
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:09,050
you know,
and when you think about it's just 

1244
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:09,050
literally millions and millions and 
millions of,

1245
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:12,530
of bombs and tons of bombs and of course
huge percentage that just never 

1246
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:16,180
explodes.
So wow,

1247
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:19,240
that's terrifying to think that that 
could be there 100 years from now.

1248
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,680
They're still potentially could be death
and your kid could step on one or it 

1249
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:24,680
could just,
you know,

1250
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,280
it might be just ready to probably 
doesn't,

1251
00:59:26,281 --> 00:59:26,870
you know,
I don't know.

1252
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:30,020
Thousands and then are just ready to be 
ticked off for one reason.

1253
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:32,000
One Ms dot wire or something like that.
I don't know.

1254
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:34,010
But it's a,
it's a serious problem.

1255
00:59:34,011 --> 00:59:35,810
And every,
if you look in the news,

1256
00:59:35,811 --> 00:59:36,920
every now and then you'll say,
oh,

1257
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:38,570
another explosion happened here.

1258
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,970
Again,
it's also not,

1259
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:43,880
it's also quite substantial in Cambodia 
parts that were bombed there and,

1260
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,680
and whatnot.
And Laos,

1261
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,540
and then they have all the internal 
wars,

1262
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:53,080
some of the countries.
It's not just us at bombed at some of 

1263
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:53,080
the other countries,
you know,

1264
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:53,360
north Vietnam bombed,
you know,

1265
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,440
these kinds of things.
So,

1266
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:00,300
uh,
there's a lot of unexploded stuff all 

1267
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:00,300
over.
So you see this bomb,

1268
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,661
you almost step on it and then a switch 
goes off and you decide to change your 

1269
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:05,930
focus.
Yeah.

1270
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:06,860
So I,
uh,

1271
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:10,850
I had been interested in transhumanism 
from the time I was in college.

1272
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:14,820
We were given an essay on Cryonics,
um,

1273
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:15,810
you know,
the,

1274
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,920
the field where you actually put dead 
people into some type of freezing 

1275
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,191
compound and then in hopes in 20,
30 years you will be able to have the 

1276
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,950
science to regenerate them and reanimate
them.

1277
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:29,960
And our English class was asked to write
an essay on it and then debate it.

1278
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:35,320
And uh,
so it was the very first time I was 

1279
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,241
introduced to it at about age 20.
And I started reading about 

1280
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:40,151
transhumanism and sort of fell in love 
with this concept of using science and 

1281
01:00:40,151 --> 01:00:42,650
technology to become superhumans,
you know,

1282
01:00:42,651 --> 01:00:45,590
uh,
just we don't need to worry about death,

1283
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:48,500
we don't need to worry about disease,
we don't need to worry about,

1284
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:49,510
um,
you know,

1285
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,880
the kinds of things that plague our 
biological beings.

1286
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:55,610
We can use science and technology to 
overcome it all.

1287
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:57,030
So I spent,
you know,

1288
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,510
a lot of the next 10 years as I was 
sailing,

1289
01:00:59,511 --> 01:01:04,511
just kind of reading about it,
being into it without doing anything 

1290
01:01:04,511 --> 01:01:04,520
about it.
But then after this incident,

1291
01:01:04,521 --> 01:01:09,250
I came back and began working on that.
The transhumanist wager a,

1292
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,330
which is the,
a novel about transhumanism.

1293
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,600
It's kind of an epic.
And I'm the.

1294
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,810
It took me many years to write the book 
because it's a pretty long,

1295
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:22,811
complex philosophical novels.
It's at least 30 percent of the book is 

1296
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:23,660
pure philosophy.
So while it's a novel,

1297
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,880
it's not a novel in the sense of,
uh,

1298
01:01:25,881 --> 01:01:30,881
you just read it and storyline.
It's actually huge amounts of just pure 

1299
01:01:30,881 --> 01:01:33,710
academic philosophy going through it.
And the book did really well.

1300
01:01:33,711 --> 01:01:34,160
And,
uh,

1301
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:39,161
you know,
I've been talking ever since about it 

1302
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:39,161
and uh,
uh,

1303
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:41,540
it's gotten me a lot of trouble because 
it's pretty controversial in what way?

1304
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:47,290
Well,
essentially the main character jethro 

1305
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:47,290
nights,
uh,

1306
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,570
he says he will do anything to live 
indefinitely.

1307
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:56,080
And so naturally the book goes out of 
its way to create an environment where 

1308
01:01:56,661 --> 01:01:58,690
he can't do what he wants.
It's,

1309
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:02,600
he's fighting a religious,
he's fighting against religious entities

1310
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:05,150
in America that are saying we don't like
trans humanism,

1311
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:08,030
we don't want it as part of a anywhere 
in America.

1312
01:02:08,031 --> 01:02:09,870
So they sort of outlawed.
And so he,

1313
01:02:09,871 --> 01:02:13,100
he kind of becomes a sort of a terrorist
for his own ideas.

1314
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,600
But the problem is,
um,

1315
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:20,190
he'll take it to all these extremes and 
in the end forms his own

1316
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:24,060
nation called transfer mania,
a floating seasteading platform.

1317
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,910
And I'm a volunteer ambassador at the 
seasteading institute.

1318
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:30,000
I know you've done something about,
we had Joe Corcoran.

1319
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:30,510
Yeah,
yeah.

1320
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:30,910
And,
uh,

1321
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:33,990
and I.
and so I kind of did a big,

1322
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,830
about a third of the book,
discuss the seasteading where a $10,000,

1323
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:42,850
some of the smartest scientists in the 
world work on creating the ability to 

1324
01:02:42,871 --> 01:02:44,940
live indefinitely.
But then the world says,

1325
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:45,210
no,
no,

1326
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:46,290
no,
this is not right.

1327
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,320
And um,
and they say we're going to take over 

1328
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:51,320
your country.
And jethro says,

1329
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,531
no,
we're going to start a world war and we 

1330
01:02:54,531 --> 01:02:56,331
have the technology to do that.
And he ends up defeating the planet and 

1331
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:58,770
making it into a transhumanist minded 
planning.

1332
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,050
What kind of crazy fucking thoughts 
going on in your head,

1333
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,740
sir?
He uses authoritarian ideas,

1334
01:03:04,741 --> 01:03:06,420
and this has been the controversy of the
book,

1335
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:09,360
is that a lot of the transhumanist,
especially the older one,

1336
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:10,320
said,
hey,

1337
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:13,500
we like it that you're writing about 
transhumanism,

1338
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,560
but we don't like that you're taking the
such extremes.

1339
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,140
But jethro is a militant leader.
He's a,

1340
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:24,290
he wants to.
His ideas to spread and they want to 

1341
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:24,810
keep taking away from.
They also in the book,

1342
01:03:24,811 --> 01:03:26,700
kill his wife and do all sorts of other 
things.

1343
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:32,210
So it's a novel where it's an epic from 
kind of his early childhood to the end 

1344
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:37,040
or near the end of his life where he 
transforms the world against everyone's 

1345
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:41,631
willing.
What makes the book controversial is 

1346
01:03:41,631 --> 01:03:43,311
that nobody likes jethro.
He's sort of this incredibly arrogant 

1347
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:48,640
machine like human being,
yet he's the good guy of the book and 

1348
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:48,890
yet you sort of cheer for him because 
you know,

1349
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:53,790
he,
even though he sort of a authoritarian,

1350
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:55,770
he sorted,
you would like him because he's driven.

1351
01:03:55,771 --> 01:03:57,990
He's like the greatest fighter you've 
ever met who just,

1352
01:03:58,170 --> 01:03:59,580
he's not,
don't tell me about rules.

1353
01:03:59,581 --> 01:04:00,840
This,
I'm just the best fighter,

1354
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:01,500
you know.

1355
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,380
And on one hand that's very admirable.
On the other hand,

1356
01:04:04,381 --> 01:04:09,381
we have rules for a reason,
but jethro breaks them to get what he 

1357
01:04:09,381 --> 01:04:12,801
wants.
And he made the transhumanist wager 

1358
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:12,801
where he really like.
He says,

1359
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:14,850
I'll put anything,
I'll do anything to achieve it.

1360
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:20,090
And that's where the controversy comes 
in because clearly if we all did 

1361
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:20,700
anything we wanted,
we'd be in a,

1362
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:24,270
in a pretty hectic place,
both politically,

1363
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,730
government,
a Swiss society,

1364
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:28,320
all these different things.
And so I,

1365
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:33,330
uh,
the book has won a lot of praise and 

1366
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:34,900
just as much criticism and there,
if you look at the,

1367
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,050
the Amazon reviews,
it's like an e,

1368
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:40,680
there's like a huge amount of one stars 
and a huge amount of five stars,

1369
01:04:40,681 --> 01:04:42,720
but not much in the middle.
And nobody said,

1370
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:47,750
you know,
everyone hates the book because they 

1371
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:47,750
call it,
you know,

1372
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:47,750
they say,
well,

1373
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:48,100
this is an evil character.
And,

1374
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:49,590
and you know,
the people that like it say,

1375
01:04:49,591 --> 01:04:54,591
no,
this is a character who actually wants 

1376
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:54,720
to fight for what he believes in and uh,
you know,

1377
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:56,790
revolutionary leaders or sort of like 
that,

1378
01:04:56,791 --> 01:04:58,080
they,
they just,

1379
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:01,970
they take us to different places and 
they use different methods that um,

1380
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,990
you know,
certainly are questionable.

1381
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:09,230
But again,
it's a fictional novel and you can take 

1382
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:09,230
it for what the artist's worth.
Well,

1383
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:13,491
this is where it gets complicated 
because you are planning on actually 

1384
01:05:13,491 --> 01:05:17,070
running for president on a transhumanism
platform.

1385
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:18,010
Now when

1386
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:23,010
you've written a book about a world war 
that gets started by a good guy with a 

1387
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:28,831
transhumanism agenda and now you're 
wanting to run for president people go 

1388
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:33,871
this Zoltan Guy,
this motherfucker think about his name,

1389
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:39,001
his name is Zoltan and he wants to run 
the planet and he wants to be a trans 

1390
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:39,400
humanism.
He wants to be a robot.

1391
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:42,310
You're turning into a robot that's going
to start a world war two,

1392
01:05:42,311 --> 01:05:44,180
run the planet.
Yeah.

1393
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,340
So that's obviously not true,
but no.

1394
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,520
No,
and of course that is the most difficult

1395
01:05:48,521 --> 01:05:53,521
question.
I'm going to be asked probably a lot as 

1396
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:53,521
I move forward with the really going to 
do this.

1397
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:53,521
Yeah,
yeah.

1398
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:54,010
No,
I mean it's already said.

1399
01:05:54,011 --> 01:05:56,290
I've sort of stake my entire reputation 
on it at this point.

1400
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:58,570
We have some big,
big publicity events,

1401
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,580
but do you think that you could possibly
win?

1402
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:03,700
So I don't think I could win this time 
around.

1403
01:06:03,701 --> 01:06:08,701
I think there's virtually no chance.
I think if you look at how far the 

1404
01:06:08,701 --> 01:06:09,930
transhumans party might do by 20,
20,

1405
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:10,990
20,
24,

1406
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:16,200
where I would potentially do it again,
I think we might have a much better 

1407
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,341
chance of making a dent now.
I don't want to be unrealistic and say 

1408
01:06:20,341 --> 01:06:23,881
that we could actually win or that I 
could win the presidency or anything 

1409
01:06:23,881 --> 01:06:23,881
like that.
But I'm,

1410
01:06:23,881 --> 01:06:28,510
I am definitely advocating for a run 
that's taking all my time.

1411
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,280
Like I'm literally dedicating now,
you know,

1412
01:06:30,281 --> 01:06:32,560
my,
all my waking hours towards this party.

1413
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,540
Really all the infrastructure that 
takes.

1414
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:36,400
It's really complicated.
I mean,

1415
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:37,450
I'm,
I basically,

1416
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,670
I'm working with advisors.
I'm working on the different.

1417
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,100
There's so many logistical things that 
one has to do,

1418
01:06:42,101 --> 01:06:47,101
including just dealing with taxes for an
entity like this and registration 

1419
01:06:47,101 --> 01:06:48,610
process,
a manifesto.

1420
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
But in the next week or two,
most of the infrastructure will be in 

1421
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,000
place.
Uh,

1422
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,470
we're already have a lot of it in and 
have a number of officers now.

1423
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:58,480
And,
uh,

1424
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:00,220
we're,
we're going for it.

1425
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:05,340
I mean,
I'm going to stake everything I have on 

1426
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:05,340
it.
My wife has given the approval,

1427
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:08,080
which is important because I got two 
kids and her and we're going to do a lot

1428
01:07:08,081 --> 01:07:10,660
of campaigning.
We're gonna have some great events.

1429
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:11,560
In fact,
I'll probably,

1430
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:15,530
hopefully be down in a few weeks to La 
to start a documentary on it without,

1431
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:20,610
which has a great budget by the way.
And so I think there'll be a lot of 

1432
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:23,941
things coming out about the 
transhumanist party that are going to 

1433
01:07:23,941 --> 01:07:26,341
work really in the favor of getting 
people to think about what would it mean

1434
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:28,830
to have a political,
uh,

1435
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,690
you know,
person running who actually wants to use

1436
01:07:31,691 --> 01:07:34,660
technology and science to change 
politics.

1437
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:35,930
Not just,
you know,

1438
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:36,820
oh,
politics,

1439
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:38,320
let's dabble a little bit in science 
policy,

1440
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:41,890
but I actually want to use technology 
and science to dominate politics.

1441
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:45,730
I think we can solve most of humanity's 
problems and,

1442
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,870
and run a much better country.
Uh,

1443
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:52,980
if we put politics and medicine and 
technology sort of at the forefront of 

1444
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:58,650
the government currently we're at the 
forefront is a lot of other issues that 

1445
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,850
defense and uh,
uh,

1446
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:01,420
you know,
I dunno.

1447
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,880
Taxes and all that stuff's very 
important of course,

1448
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:04,840
but,
um,

1449
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,440
I'm an idealist and I would like to make
it so that we can.

1450
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:13,620
Everyone can live longer.
Everyone has the choice to potentially 

1451
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:17,430
not die.
Now I'm pretty convinced that if we put 

1452
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:18,470
a trillion dollars towards conquering 
death,

1453
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:22,040
we would probably achieve it.
Most experts actually feel that way too.

1454
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:27,041
That the amount of money that's actually
going into life extension science right 

1455
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:28,490
now is so small,
literally hundreds of millions.

1456
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:32,120
But if we actually could quadruple or 
maybe make it 20 times,

1457
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:37,121
then we could take the 20,
30 year window and make it into 10 

1458
01:08:37,121 --> 01:08:40,301
years.
And that's one of the platforms is that 

1459
01:08:40,301 --> 01:08:40,301
we're gonna have the parties to say,
well,

1460
01:08:40,301 --> 01:08:45,131
we're going to take money from our wars,
are far off wars and put it directly 

1461
01:08:45,131 --> 01:08:46,700
towards important things.
Education,

1462
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:50,690
science and technology,
and also life extension science.

1463
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:52,980
So,
but to enter your,

1464
01:08:52,981 --> 01:08:53,450
your,
your,

1465
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:58,660
your,
your somewhat dangerous question for me 

1466
01:08:58,660 --> 01:08:58,660
publicly.
Um,

1467
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:02,690
I,
I'm distancing myself from the book 

1468
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:04,571
because it was,
it was a moment of writing something 

1469
01:09:04,571 --> 01:09:05,900
very artistic and trying to write 
something very philosophical.

1470
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:10,190
But the philosophy of jethro nights does
not work in a political campaign,

1471
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:14,510
and I'm,
I'm doing my best to disassociate myself

1472
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:17,190
from his ways,
even though I,

1473
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:22,200
I'm the creator of the philosophy and 
I'm the one who sort of spent all these 

1474
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,830
years developing it,
but I would never work.

1475
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,440
It would never work in America as we are
today.

1476
01:09:27,441 --> 01:09:30,260
We live in a country that's very free.
There aren't a bunch of religious people

1477
01:09:30,261 --> 01:09:32,690
trying to stamp out transhumanism in the
book.

1478
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:37,720
He lives in a war environment.
That's part of why he fights back with 

1479
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:37,720
war.
So luckily,

1480
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,690
you know,
we live in a pretty awesome country.

1481
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,630
You can mostly do what you want.
And um,

1482
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:46,910
I'd like to convince people to do a lot 
more than just building bombs and uh,

1483
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:52,180
and some of the crazy things that they 
do and spend it towards science and 

1484
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:53,000
technology and it hoping that everyone 
will eventually like it.

1485
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:58,270
Everyone will eventually live better.
Everyone will eventually kind of be 

1486
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:00,971
taken to a new era where you know,
their families and their loved ones 

1487
01:10:00,971 --> 01:10:03,860
don't have to die.
We have all the benefits of technology.

1488
01:10:03,861 --> 01:10:05,330
Like,
we don't have traffic in La,

1489
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,220
like I told you,
I mean these are kinds of things,

1490
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:12,340
you know,
driverless cars that are going to 

1491
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:12,340
improve everything.

1492
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:12,740
And I think if more people embrace 
technology,

1493
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,550
we might go a lot further,
um,

1494
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,640
as a species and also as a country.
The obvious question,

1495
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:25,080
um,
when you say if people live forever or 

1496
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:25,730
people could get to a point where they 
don't die,

1497
01:10:25,731 --> 01:10:28,640
we can conquer death.
We have too many people.

1498
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:31,880
There's 7 billion people on the planet,
right?

1499
01:10:31,881 --> 01:10:33,430
Is that what the number is now?
Yeah,

1500
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,300
I think it's.
And it's going on fast.

1501
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:36,860
Yeah,
it's going up fast.

1502
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:38,660
Los Angeles,
as you said,

1503
01:10:38,661 --> 01:10:42,140
we were talking on the way about you 
traveling on the way over here,

1504
01:10:42,141 --> 01:10:45,110
how difficult it was to get here because
the traffic is so bad.

1505
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:50,410
You know,
there's 20 plus million people in Los 

1506
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:53,380
Angeles.
What happens if they keep having babies 

1507
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:53,380
and no one dies?
Yeah.

1508
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:57,581
So you know,
this is one of the most challenging 

1509
01:10:57,581 --> 01:11:00,670
questions and most challenging ideas 
about the problem with transhumanism 

1510
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:05,110
right now is when we advocate for 
technology and science to change 

1511
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:05,110
people's lives.

1512
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:07,910
And make them live longer and better.
The first question everyone says,

1513
01:11:07,911 --> 01:11:08,660
well,
hey man,

1514
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:11,540
we've got environmental problems in the 
world and I agree we do.

1515
01:11:11,541 --> 01:11:16,541
I,
I'm a believer in some of the climate 

1516
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:16,680
change problems.
I'm a believer in,

1517
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:19,320
you know,
a overpopulation.

1518
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,900
I'm not going to in any way try to deny 
some of these things.

1519
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:25,260
I actually think the science stands 
pretty strongly for it.

1520
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:30,510
The question though is whether tackling 
that broadly,

1521
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:35,870
I'm tackling environmental problems with
the kind of ideas that we're trying to 

1522
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:40,761
do right now.
I'm less population a recycling and you 

1523
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:42,080
know,
and stuff like,

1524
01:11:42,081 --> 01:11:47,081
you know,
just the basic things we're trying to 

1525
01:11:47,081 --> 01:11:47,081
empower ourselves to be a more green 
world.

1526
01:11:47,081 --> 01:11:51,260
I'm not 100 percent sure that that is 
the accurate or that is the very best 

1527
01:11:51,421 --> 01:11:56,421
path we can take a.
Now this gets kind of SPEC speculative 

1528
01:11:56,421 --> 01:11:57,690
and I don't actually endorse this 
necessarily as,

1529
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,970
as a kind of a political platform,
but I'm pretty quiet.

1530
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:06,310
Pretty convinced that within 25 to 50 
years people will start downloading 

1531
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:08,250
their consciousness into machines and 
stuff like that.

1532
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:13,730
So there's this idea that maybe we'll 
start using a lot less resources 100 

1533
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:15,240
years from now,
um,

1534
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:18,270
because people will live in digital 
lives and virtual lives.

1535
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:19,310
Uh,
you know,

1536
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:24,320
maybe we'll all live.
Maybe the entire population will fit 

1537
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:24,320
into that,
uh,

1538
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,770
empire state building that is full of 
servers as we had discussed.

1539
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:31,050
Um,
and maybe the earth will have a chance 

1540
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:31,050
to grow back or come back to what,
you know,

1541
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:32,110
it's formed,
but that's not the,

1542
01:12:32,111 --> 01:12:32,460
uh,
you know,

1543
01:12:32,461 --> 01:12:37,461
that's just one of the kind of 
speculative ideas that trans humanists 

1544
01:12:37,461 --> 01:12:41,990
might use to counter some of the 
criticism that we get a about 

1545
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:42,960
environmental prompts.
I'm personally,

1546
01:12:42,961 --> 01:12:45,390
what I'm for is for a lot of the green 
technology,

1547
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,890
that's the stuff I want to see.

1548
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:49,890
I want to see solar power increase.
I want to see money going towards that.

1549
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,800
I want to see money going towards the 
windmills.

1550
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:57,830
I want to see money going towards the 
green types of technologies that not 

1551
01:12:57,830 --> 01:13:01,710
only can make a whole new generation of 
wealthy people and give millions of jobs

1552
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,090
to people,
but it can also,

1553
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:05,490
at the same time help the planet.
So,

1554
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:07,290
you know,
I take this two fold approach,

1555
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:12,291
one is very speculative in the future,
there'll be space exploration and all 

1556
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:15,981
these other things.
We might figure out a ways that don't 

1557
01:13:15,981 --> 01:13:19,761
make us so dependent on the planet,
but the more important ways that we're 

1558
01:13:19,761 --> 01:13:22,290
going to spend money on the type of 
technologies that really make the planet

1559
01:13:22,291 --> 01:13:23,070
better,
you know,

1560
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:26,970
get people to move into cities,
make them green or a leave,

1561
01:13:26,971 --> 01:13:30,150
open spaces their loan.
And I'm a big animal advocate as well.

1562
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:33,630
I worked with wildlife.
A lot of my national geographic work was

1563
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:35,130
with wildlife.
So I'm,

1564
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:37,890
I'm,
I'd love to see the species replenished.

1565
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:42,980
I'd love to see it so that we can 
actually go to national parks and have 

1566
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:46,431
the kinds of things that we all hope for
where you see deer and you could take 

1567
01:13:46,431 --> 01:13:48,740
your children out there and uh,
and especially in afterwards.

1568
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,300
So much poaching and stuff like that.
Of course.

1569
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:52,570
Um,
you know,

1570
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,650
in America we do a pretty good job with 
protecting our wildlife.

1571
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:56,480
But,
um,

1572
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:00,060
I'd like to see us be more of a leader 
on the international front staying.

1573
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:05,150
We actually need to say stop it.
It's crazy that the tiger population is 

1574
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:06,870
literally on the edge of extinction,
literally gone.

1575
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:10,350
There are more tigers in Texas than 
there are in the wild.

1576
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,370
It's incredible.
It's sad.

1577
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,400
It's terrible because they are an 
important part of the,

1578
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:17,380
you know,
the ecosystem in all the places that are

1579
01:14:17,381 --> 01:14:18,870
at.
And uh,

1580
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:22,870
one of the stories we covered was the 
Siamese crocodile when I was in Cambodia

1581
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:25,990
and um,
there's a couple in captivity,

1582
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:31,120
but basically the last time someone saw 
one was like 13 years ago in the wild.

1583
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:32,790
And so it's gone,
you know,

1584
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:34,030
it's,
it's essentially gone.

1585
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,740
And uh,
when you think about it,

1586
01:14:35,741 --> 01:14:36,130
you're like,
well,

1587
01:14:36,131 --> 01:14:39,530
that's a certain species just basically 
gone and why is it going on?

1588
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:42,490
People were making boots and stuff out 
of it's tails and whatnot.

1589
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:48,000
So I would like to advocate for policies
that kind of make that happen less and,

1590
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:53,401
uh,
generally increase our environmental 

1591
01:14:53,401 --> 01:14:53,980
consciousness with money instead of 
building bombs,

1592
01:14:53,981 --> 01:14:54,540
hey,
let's,

1593
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,530
let's spend it on building electric 
cars.

1594
01:14:56,531 --> 01:14:59,950
Let's spend it on other ideas.
Even more unique ideas than that.

1595
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:05,220
Well,
there's a lot of things to discuss 

1596
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:05,220
their,
first of all,

1597
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:05,220
um,
the beginning of this,

1598
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:09,310
you were talking about downloading 
consciousness into computers,

1599
01:15:09,311 --> 01:15:12,970
so you're kind of advocating a non 
biological life.

1600
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:15,880
You're kind of advocating life inside of
a server,

1601
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:17,800
a virtual life,
and that,

1602
01:15:17,801 --> 01:15:22,801
that will be the future of life that is 
really hard for people to conceptualize.

1603
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:29,010
It's really hard for the average person 
who just likes to go on facebook every 

1604
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:32,431
now and then,
post pictures of their dog with a 

1605
01:15:32,431 --> 01:15:32,431
fucking boner had,
you know what I mean?

1606
01:15:32,431 --> 01:15:34,340
Like one day you're going to live in a 
computer like that's going to.

1607
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,700
It won't be just your photos in a 
computer,

1608
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:41,850
your mind,
your consciousness will live in a 

1609
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:44,431
computer,
your body will die and you will exist 

1610
01:15:44,431 --> 01:15:44,440
in,
in ones and Zeros,

1611
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:49,710
in some sort of a program like that to a
lot of people that doesn't seem like 

1612
01:15:50,531 --> 01:15:51,040
life.

1613
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:55,780
Um,
it could get to a point in our lifetimes

1614
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,380
where it is indistinguishable from life.
And that is in fact,

1615
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:05,250
one of the freakiest ideas that's 
bandied about today by people far more 

1616
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:09,301
intelligent than me.
This is not my own philosophical stoner 

1617
01:16:09,301 --> 01:16:12,030
ramblings,
but the concept of living right now in 

1618
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
some sort of a computer simulation,
and this has been discussed ad nauseum 

1619
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,060
amongst physicists and scientists that 
we're going to come,

1620
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:27,070
there's gonna come a point in time where
we will be able to create some sort of a

1621
01:16:27,071 --> 01:16:31,180
virtual life that is absolutely 
indistinguishable from the life that you

1622
01:16:31,181 --> 01:16:33,880
and I are experiencing right now.
If that's the case,

1623
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:36,730
how do we know we're not already in it?
You know,

1624
01:16:36,731 --> 01:16:38,290
that's,
that's the big mind.

1625
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:38,980
Fuck,
right.

1626
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:40,360
That's the big mind.
Fuck.

1627
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:42,600
When it comes to quantum theory and 
when,

1628
01:16:42,601 --> 01:16:47,601
when people start talking about virtual 
realities is that we may already be in 

1629
01:16:47,601 --> 01:16:47,601
one.

1630
01:16:47,601 --> 01:16:52,380
I did my senior thesis at university on 
brains in a VAT exact same concept.

1631
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:57,601
So it was,
I spent like a whole month writing a 24 

1632
01:16:57,601 --> 01:16:57,601
page paper.
It's crazy.

1633
01:16:57,601 --> 01:16:58,030
In fact,
after writing the paper,

1634
01:16:58,031 --> 01:17:03,031
I was like,
it took me like a week to even become 

1635
01:17:03,031 --> 01:17:03,031
normal again because you,
you can't,

1636
01:17:03,031 --> 01:17:04,990
you can't choose.
And that scares me,

1637
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,600
you know,
you can't say I'm not in one arm in one.

1638
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:08,920
And um,
yeah,

1639
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:10,430
it's,
it's a totally freaky concept.

1640
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,450
Not only that,
you,

1641
01:17:11,451 --> 01:17:15,200
you can't say it and it's going to 
happen if we don't,

1642
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:18,470
if that super volcano doesn't blow,
if we don't get hit by the media,

1643
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:22,940
there's going to come a point in time if
technology continues to increase,

1644
01:17:22,941 --> 01:17:27,941
whether it's 50 years from now or 100 
years from now or a thousand years from 

1645
01:17:27,941 --> 01:17:32,081
now,
our ability to control reality itself 

1646
01:17:32,081 --> 01:17:35,450
will reach some sort of an epic point 
where we can create a virtual reality.

1647
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:37,580
I'm sure you've messed around with 
oculus rift.

1648
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,810
I have,
I,

1649
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,820
I haven't tried the new one.
I tried.

1650
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,990
My friend Duncan is a,
he's um,

1651
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,970
he's got the old model and now he has a 
new model.

1652
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:50,000
Here's the developer's kit and the old 
one I put on,

1653
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:52,880
it was all pixelated and weird,
but it gave you the sense like,

1654
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:54,020
wow,
this is kind of freaky.

1655
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:00,040
He called me up.
He went to some sort of a virtual 

1656
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:03,131
conference that they had in Los Angeles 
and he called me up just ranting and 

1657
01:18:03,131 --> 01:18:03,200
screaming.
It's over,

1658
01:18:03,201 --> 01:18:05,660
man.
This is bigger than the printing press.

1659
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:09,350
This is bigger than the Internet,
like this is fucking over.

1660
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,720
We're gonna,
this is gonna be reality,

1661
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:16,721
and he was just freaking out so much so 
that I'm scared to go and try this 

1662
01:18:16,721 --> 01:18:19,310
headset on.
But he was talking about going into some

1663
01:18:19,311 --> 01:18:24,311
virtual room where there's a person 
playing the piano and you you interact 

1664
01:18:24,311 --> 01:18:28,241
with them and you feel like you're in 
the room with them and he said it was 

1665
01:18:28,241 --> 01:18:28,790
the freakiest thing he's ever 
experienced in his life because it's all

1666
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:32,410
in like four k hd super,
like,

1667
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,990
like really,
really clear video.

1668
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:41,260
And they apparently the way they do it,
they put cameras all over the person's 

1669
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,310
body when they film.
This camera's on your hands,

1670
01:18:43,311 --> 01:18:48,311
cameras on your legs.
So everywhere you look they have it 

1671
01:18:48,311 --> 01:18:52,271
covered and it's just a matter of the 
processing power of being able to keep 

1672
01:18:52,271 --> 01:18:54,290
up with all the different potential 
views that you have.

1673
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:57,830
Same as when you're going into a 
computer,

1674
01:18:57,831 --> 01:19:02,831
three d generated world,
like a video game like quake or 

1675
01:19:02,831 --> 01:19:03,740
something like that where you're going 
down corridors and you could look up and

1676
01:19:03,741 --> 01:19:05,600
look down.
They have it like that.

1677
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:10,750
But they have it in complete the read 
dimensional hd video to the point where 

1678
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:16,180
it it's indistinguishable from actually 
looking at these things in real life and

1679
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,530
that's just now.
I mean,

1680
01:19:18,531 --> 01:19:23,531
what does that going to be like 50 years
from now when they figure out how to do 

1681
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:27,030
something on your head where they put 
you know,

1682
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:32,210
electrodes or something where they can 
stimulate parts of your mind that can 

1683
01:19:32,451 --> 01:19:37,451
give you the sensations of the feel of 
the wooden floor giving slightly under 

1684
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:40,670
your feet,
the texture of a wall.

1685
01:19:40,671 --> 01:19:45,671
As you run your fingers by you will,
you'll be able to feel that on your 

1686
01:19:45,671 --> 01:19:46,340
fingertips and then a thousand years 
from that,

1687
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:47,800
what happens then?
I mean,

1688
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:49,340
what happens then?
What happens then?

1689
01:19:49,341 --> 01:19:51,740
What happens then it keeps going and 
going and going and going,

1690
01:19:51,741 --> 01:19:56,741
and if you extrapolate,
if you look at where we are now and you 

1691
01:19:56,741 --> 01:19:59,591
look at the future,
it's almost impossible for us to not 

1692
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:02,410
reach a point where were 
indistinguishable where reality and 

1693
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:04,010
virtual reality are indistinguishable 
from each other.

1694
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:06,470
No,
I couldn't agree more.

1695
01:20:06,471 --> 01:20:08,160
And if you try that stuff on,

1696
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,230
that's really the.
It's sort of like the landmine thing.

1697
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:15,260
Once you've tried that on,
it really is such a freaky thing that 

1698
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:15,260
you realize,
oh,

1699
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:15,450
this is here today.
Okay.

1700
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:17,070
It's not perfect,
but in 10,

1701
01:20:17,071 --> 01:20:18,960
15 years common,
it's common.

1702
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:23,850
And I think a lot of.
I think a lot of younger people get that

1703
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,340
because they either tried it or they're 
cool with it.

1704
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:27,560
They grew up like my,
uh,

1705
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,840
my 11 month old or a 10 month old 
daughter is already quite adept.

1706
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:37,910
She's already pretty quite good at using
like the ipad and skipping through 

1707
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:41,271
things.
She doesn't know what the APP's mean 

1708
01:20:41,271 --> 01:20:42,561
yet,
but she's only 11 months and she's just 

1709
01:20:42,561 --> 01:20:43,200
growing up with this technology.
And so for her,

1710
01:20:43,201 --> 01:20:46,770
I think to put on a virtual reality 
setup,

1711
01:20:46,771 --> 01:20:50,430
it's going to be in 10 years or 15 years
is not going to even dent her.

1712
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:52,080
She's not going to be scared of it.
She's going to be,

1713
01:20:52,081 --> 01:20:53,730
have heard the word,
she's going to be,

1714
01:20:53,731 --> 01:20:55,860
have heard transhumanism for the last 10
years.

1715
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:58,130
It will be like stepping in.
Um,

1716
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:03,770
you know,
I think when people first talked about 

1717
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:03,770
cars,
they must have thought,

1718
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:06,561
well how weird,
what do you mean we're going to get rid 

1719
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:08,031
of the horse?
And then the next generation thought 

1720
01:21:08,031 --> 01:21:08,031
will,
I can't believe you guys were in a horse

1721
01:21:08,031 --> 01:21:11,660
and sort of like the way we talk about 
either fax machines now or you know,

1722
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:16,290
the new generation is going to take it 
and run with it and they're not going to

1723
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:21,291
be afraid of it at all.
I think it's people our age that are 

1724
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:24,291
already still,
we're like a little skeptical and then 

1725
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:27,051
it's people above us that are really 
still out there and they have to 

1726
01:21:27,051 --> 01:21:27,051
actually test it to see it.

1727
01:21:27,051 --> 01:21:28,440
But in 15 years,
no matter who tests it,

1728
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:33,500
it's going to be so real.
I think the philosophical dilemma there 

1729
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,760
is that people are gonna say,
well,

1730
01:21:35,761 --> 01:21:39,120
it's not real life.
And people like myself,

1731
01:21:39,121 --> 01:21:39,930
we're going to say,
well,

1732
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,220
why not,
you know,

1733
01:21:41,221 --> 01:21:43,950
what makes that real knife just because 
it's created,

1734
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:44,970
um,
you know,

1735
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:48,840
through a machine how to say this hasn't
created through a machine.

1736
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,160
You know,
what's the say?

1737
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:55,280
This is so different.
You touched something in there and it 

1738
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,040
feels maybe even more real than it does 
now.

1739
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:01,280
You know,
maybe the touching of wood there as we 

1740
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:01,280
had talked about,
if you have sensors on your fingers,

1741
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:04,500
it's not just touching wood will be able
to determine the strength of that would.

1742
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,190
I can't,
you know,

1743
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:06,840
you know,
we can do all these things right now,

1744
01:22:06,841 --> 01:22:11,841
but for example,
I'm writing an article right now on I'm 

1745
01:22:11,841 --> 01:22:13,250
blind people using,
uh,

1746
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:18,410
artificial robotic eyes,
bionic eyes to see and they're now 

1747
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:22,850
basically kind of doing a surgery where 
they put something into your eye and 

1748
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:27,051
then they can program it through these 
goggles that you wear and blind people 

1749
01:22:27,051 --> 01:22:27,051
can now effectively see.

1750
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,040
So it's like,
look,

1751
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,230
the character on star Trek.
Yes,

1752
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:32,390
exactly.
That's exactly what it looks like to it.

1753
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:37,480
It's called,
I think the argus two is one of the 

1754
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:37,480
latest ones.
But,

1755
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:37,480
um,
the,

1756
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:41,541
uh,
the point though is that part of my 

1757
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:41,541
articles,
what are they doing now?

1758
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:45,480
Because last year they went from like 
black and white to upgrading the eyes to

1759
01:22:45,481 --> 01:22:47,790
color.
They can program in the certain types of

1760
01:22:47,791 --> 01:22:50,040
lights that hit color into your nerve 
cells,

1761
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:55,490
but soon they're going to start 
programming things like we talked about 

1762
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:58,311
gases or you know,
eventually it's just a matter of the 

1763
01:22:58,311 --> 01:22:59,370
machinery will be able to have whatever 
capabilities you can give it.

1764
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:00,440
It's not a,
you know,

1765
01:23:00,441 --> 01:23:03,870
you were not limited anymore.
Our eyeballs are limited to its biology,

1766
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:06,160
but if we have robotic that ties

1767
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:11,160
into the nervous system,
our nervous system can understand 

1768
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,831
anything.
The reason we don't see much more than 

1769
01:23:13,831 --> 01:23:13,831
we see is because our eyeballs are 
frankly,

1770
01:23:13,831 --> 01:23:18,211
they're quite poor when you give a,
when you think about what kind of 

1771
01:23:18,211 --> 01:23:20,110
mechanisms are out there that can really
be attached inside there.

1772
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,340
And uh,
so the,

1773
01:23:21,341 --> 01:23:25,210
the articles about what is the future of
the 10 year future of Ra,

1774
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:30,230
a bionic eyes.
And I'm a pretty big believer that 

1775
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:33,300
within 10 years we'll have bionic eyes 
that are almost equivalent of the human 

1776
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:37,831
eye.
And probably within 15 or 20 years 

1777
01:23:37,831 --> 01:23:38,890
people will start replacing one of their
eyes for the bionic one.

1778
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,650
And the reason they'll do so is because,
like I said,

1779
01:23:41,651 --> 01:23:46,651
you're going to,
it's not just seeing one percent of the 

1780
01:23:46,651 --> 01:23:49,141
universe anymore,
the computers and the programs and the 

1781
01:23:49,141 --> 01:23:49,141
devices will be able to see far more.

1782
01:23:49,141 --> 01:23:50,320
You're gonna be able to see through 
walls.

1783
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,090
You're going to be able to see,
and this is,

1784
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:55,080
this is stuff companies are like 
literally working on right now.

1785
01:23:55,420 --> 01:24:00,420
This is blind.
People have already seen this happen in 

1786
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:02,881
2012 and 2013.
Now they're starting to upgrade the 

1787
01:24:02,881 --> 01:24:03,910
software and you know what happens when 
they start upgrading things.

1788
01:24:03,911 --> 01:24:04,990
It's then it's like,
okay,

1789
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:09,991
we got the apparatus in place.
Now let's see what kind of magic this 

1790
01:24:09,991 --> 01:24:09,991
can do.
And this is just the eyeball.

1791
01:24:09,991 --> 01:24:11,500
The same thing's happening with the 
human heart.

1792
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,860
The same thing's going to be happening 
with the ear very soon we're going to be

1793
01:24:14,861 --> 01:24:19,861
replacing place parts in ourselves and 
going for upgrades and our lives are 

1794
01:24:20,531 --> 01:24:23,650
going to become much more complex,
better live longer,

1795
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:28,860
but also experience will be different.
Experience will be sort of like virtual 

1796
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:32,911
reality.
It's such a different experience that 

1797
01:24:32,911 --> 01:24:33,370
once you've gone through it,
you realize it's kind of,

1798
01:24:33,371 --> 01:24:38,371
you know,
I've heard you talk a little bit about 

1799
01:24:38,371 --> 01:24:38,371
drugs in the show and I'm a big 
proponent of,

1800
01:24:38,371 --> 01:24:39,760
of experimental drugs myself.

1801
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,190
I think it's,
I think it's quite great for,

1802
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:46,360
for kids to do all sorts of stuff,
including adults.

1803
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:51,380
I will.
You just fucked up your presidential 

1804
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:51,380
chances right there.
Oh,

1805
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:51,380
no way.
That's great for kids to do drugs.

1806
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:51,380
Well,
not,

1807
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:51,780
no,
I don't.

1808
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:53,830
I don't mean kids.
I mean,

1809
01:24:53,831 --> 01:24:58,831
you know,
a 20 somethings 21 year olds and above 

1810
01:24:58,831 --> 01:24:59,840
those youngins yeah.
Uh,

1811
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:01,960
we're,
I'm 40 I guess kids or anything,

1812
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:02,830
you know,
in their twenties,

1813
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,460
in their thirties,
right.

1814
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:07,690
Fucking wacky kids.
But ultimately,

1815
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:10,210
you know,
whether we like it or not and whether,

1816
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:10,810
you know,
again,

1817
01:25:10,811 --> 01:25:15,811
I'm not running on some presidential 
campaign to try to be the guy who 

1818
01:25:15,811 --> 01:25:15,811
pretends these things.
It's,

1819
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:19,330
I'm luckily not at that point yet.
Maybe in eight years I'll have to wash a

1820
01:25:19,331 --> 01:25:21,880
lot more what I say,
but right now I'm a big.

1821
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:25,470
I think you will.
I think eight years from now we're going

1822
01:25:25,471 --> 01:25:28,810
to be able to know exactly what you mean
without you even have an accent.

1823
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:34,170
I think eight years from now we're going
to have such amazing access to each 

1824
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,950
other's minds that are getting closer 
and closer.

1825
01:25:35,951 --> 01:25:36,880
Possibly.
Yeah.

1826
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:41,881
I don't.
I don't think you're going to have to 

1827
01:25:41,881 --> 01:25:41,881
worry about people lying anymore.
Well,

1828
01:25:41,881 --> 01:25:41,881
that would be great because then they 
won't,

1829
01:25:41,881 --> 01:25:46,470
we can't.
We can know when they're pretending 

1830
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:46,470
stuff,
you know.

1831
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:46,470
And,
and the truth is,

1832
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:46,900
I think all of us in many of your 
listeners,

1833
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:51,960
we all realize that there are lots of 
things out there that the government 

1834
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:54,670
considers illegal considers terrible,
that have been very useful for artists,

1835
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:58,600
creative types and basically people in 
general to expand their consciousness.

1836
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,250
And I think,
you know,

1837
01:26:00,251 --> 01:26:04,040
the technology will be also some new 
form of enabling us to

1838
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,390
expand our consciousness.
Like I said,

1839
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:10,391
if we have a bionic eye and it allows us
to see different things that's going to 

1840
01:26:10,391 --> 01:26:14,470
mess with our consciousness in some way.
And you can combine that with all sorts 

1841
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:14,470
of things.
And um,

1842
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:16,520
I'm a big advocate and in doing 
anything,

1843
01:26:16,521 --> 01:26:19,880
as long as it doesn't harm someone else,
I think it's open game.

1844
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:22,190
I agree.
And I think that when you,

1845
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:25,910
when you think about the possibility of 
improving our organs,

1846
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:31,120
I think we could also look at the 
natural world and what we know about 

1847
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,350
like for instance,
look what dogs can smell like the,

1848
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:38,400
the incredible ability that some animals
have to see things like my friend Matt 

1849
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:43,650
from,
he lives in Alaska and we were talking 

1850
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:45,431
this weekend about fishing and he was 
saying that sometimes when they fish 

1851
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:49,340
they'll catch sharks.
And when they pull them out of the,

1852
01:26:49,341 --> 01:26:50,210
uh,
the ocean,

1853
01:26:50,211 --> 01:26:52,430
like the catch them accidentally when 
they're fishing for halibut.

1854
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:57,700
And when they released them,
they on the surface of the water and 

1855
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:01,000
eagles can see them from a mile away.
They can see a fish just swimming on the

1856
01:27:01,971 --> 01:27:05,150
surface of the water from a mile away.
And they'll just show up.

1857
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:08,000
They show up and they grab it.
It's like their eyes,

1858
01:27:08,001 --> 01:27:11,630
like our vision of what that could be.
It's so,

1859
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:16,690
but think about like you can see a fire 
in the distance and aunt has no fucking 

1860
01:27:17,301 --> 01:27:19,140
idea that fires out there.
You know,

1861
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:24,160
Jamie was showing me this photo of a,
there was a huge fire last night in Los 

1862
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,760
Angeles and from a distance it looked 
like,

1863
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:29,000
like,
like a bomb had gone off.

1864
01:27:29,001 --> 01:27:31,400
It looked like a missile would hit some 
apartment building.

1865
01:27:31,401 --> 01:27:32,630
It was a huge,
huge fire,

1866
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,970
melted signs that we're saying on the 
1:10

1867
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:39,170
now we can see that.
But to a worm,

1868
01:27:39,230 --> 01:27:40,640
they have no fucking idea that's going 
on.

1869
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:45,730
So we already know that biologically 
there are animals that have organs that 

1870
01:27:45,801 --> 01:27:47,810
work far better than the ones that we 
have.

1871
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:52,700
So we're completely aware that their 
ability to smell things,

1872
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:57,701
their ability to hear things.
I mean you can just ruffle your fingers 

1873
01:27:57,701 --> 01:28:01,991
together slightly across the room.
And my cat's ear will like turn like 

1874
01:28:01,991 --> 01:28:05,651
that.
She can hear shit that I couldn't even 

1875
01:28:05,651 --> 01:28:07,760
hope to hear in a million years.
We know those organs exist.

1876
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:12,940
We know that their capacities are far 
beyond anything that we have and if we 

1877
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:16,631
start giving people cat eyes and cat 
ears and dog noses and you know the 

1878
01:28:16,941 --> 01:28:21,941
ability to do that mean we will 
radically transform human existence just

1879
01:28:22,611 --> 01:28:27,611
based on not even fantastical like 
science fiction versions of these 

1880
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:33,011
organs,
but organs that we know exist in the 

1881
01:28:33,011 --> 01:28:33,011
biological world.
No,

1882
01:28:33,011 --> 01:28:33,230
a hundred,
100 percent.

1883
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:34,400
You know,
so my,

1884
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:39,520
my articles,
one of the funniest things about the 

1885
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,750
articles that it's quite possible within
10 years of blind person will see better

1886
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:45,740
than a normal biological person where 
they'll have the ability to see,

1887
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:51,390
you know,
a 150 miles and they'll have ability to 

1888
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:51,390
see various tiny things that are.

1889
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:54,020
The human eye can never see that.
That's how far technology has come where

1890
01:28:54,021 --> 01:28:56,950
a blind person has better site than a 
real person.

1891
01:28:56,951 --> 01:29:01,951
Now it's not here,
but it's definitely probably going to 

1892
01:29:01,951 --> 01:29:01,951
happen within the next decade.
Well,

1893
01:29:01,951 --> 01:29:05,260
I have reading.
He's a little little glasses as I'm 47 

1894
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:08,841
and as I've gotten older,
one of the things that's happened is 

1895
01:29:08,841 --> 01:29:08,910
most likely from fucking staring at 
screens all the time.

1896
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:12,600
My closeup vision starting to suck,
like when I can,

1897
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,030
I can read like my,
my iphone,

1898
01:29:15,031 --> 01:29:16,110
I can read it.
Fine.

1899
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:17,370
No,
no issues at all.

1900
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:22,550
But when I start reading small print,
like all small website or something like

1901
01:29:22,891 --> 01:29:27,891
that,
like I need to put on the reading 

1902
01:29:27,891 --> 01:29:28,050
glasses in there.
One and a half.

1903
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:32,250
What regular vision is like?
So it's one plus 50.

1904
01:29:32,990 --> 01:29:34,860
That's,
that's like robotics.

1905
01:29:34,861 --> 01:29:36,750
I mean this is like this is technology.

1906
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:39,870
I'm putting something over my eyes.
It changes my eyes right now.

1907
01:29:39,871 --> 01:29:42,600
It just goes over and some people they 
get Lasik,

1908
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:44,550
they changed their,
their actual lens,

1909
01:29:44,551 --> 01:29:46,560
they cut it,
they do it with technology,

1910
01:29:46,561 --> 01:29:51,561
they changed the form of it and then 
some people get artificial lens is put 

1911
01:29:51,561 --> 01:29:55,251
in when they have issues or or you know,
they get injuries and I know fighters 

1912
01:29:55,251 --> 01:29:57,090
who've gotten artificial lenses put into
their eyes.

1913
01:29:57,870 --> 01:30:00,540
It's gonna.
It's gonna Creep up on us.

1914
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:03,810
I think it's like people with hearing 
aids and you know,

1915
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:08,840
some folks have artificial hips.
I have a friend who was an artificial 

1916
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:12,681
hip.
I have another friend who is an 

1917
01:30:12,681 --> 01:30:12,681
artificial knee,
you know,

1918
01:30:12,681 --> 01:30:15,041
and these,
these are becoming more and more 

1919
01:30:15,041 --> 01:30:17,130
commonplace where they are taking parts 
that are not working well anymore and 

1920
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:20,880
replacing them with robotics.
I was just doing an article apparently I

1921
01:30:20,881 --> 01:30:25,881
think around 300,000
people in the world have this cochlear 

1922
01:30:25,881 --> 01:30:30,141
implant which is actually inside and 
that's 300 thousands.

1923
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:35,300
Not like $300.
I mean that's a huge number around the 

1924
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:35,700
world that are having,
hearing problems that have this,

1925
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:40,820
that decided to go undergo a surgery 
that involves her skull and head 

1926
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:43,820
essentially and have this implanted.
That's great because um,

1927
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:49,120
and those people apparently here far 
better and now society is changing.

1928
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:55,460
It's just going to take,
it's going to take take interviews like 

1929
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:55,790
this where people hear about it and you 
know,

1930
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,590
if you hear about enough times,
all of a sudden you're like,

1931
01:30:58,591 --> 01:31:03,591
oh,
well I know someone else did that or 

1932
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:03,591
this dad,
you know.

1933
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:04,170
And eventually everyone will sort of 
hopefully start to say,

1934
01:31:04,171 --> 01:31:05,100
well,
this is great,

1935
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:05,700
you know,
and,

1936
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:06,480
and,
uh,

1937
01:31:06,481 --> 01:31:11,481
I think the big thing is really getting 
a lot more government funding for these 

1938
01:31:11,481 --> 01:31:15,240
kinds of things because sometimes it 
seems so speculative,

1939
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:20,270
but if we improve the world,
improve people's biological beings and 

1940
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:24,741
their livelihoods,
it's hard to argue with that kind of 

1941
01:31:24,741 --> 01:31:24,741
logic.

1942
01:31:24,741 --> 01:31:25,710
It's just the skin better.
It is getting better.

1943
01:31:25,711 --> 01:31:29,160
And as we said,
when it comes to technology,

1944
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:31,870
if we don't blow ourselves up or the,
the,

1945
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,000
the universe doesn't send a rock our 
way.

1946
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:37,380
It seems inevitable that we'll continue 
this progress.

1947
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:42,440
It just seems inevitable.
And I think there's a certain duty that 

1948
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:45,480
we have,
especially folks like you have that have

1949
01:31:45,481 --> 01:31:50,481
the scientific know how our knowledge 
and the information to inform people 

1950
01:31:51,151 --> 01:31:55,440
that this process is underway and you 
better prepare yourself because there's,

1951
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:59,040
there's no getting away from it.
As long as we are human beings,

1952
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:04,350
we are never satisfied.
There's a horsepower revolution right 

1953
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:07,531
now with cars.
It's gotten completely on hand and 

1954
01:32:07,531 --> 01:32:07,990
totally ridiculous.
I don't know if you're aware if you're a

1955
01:32:07,991 --> 01:32:09,940
car person,
but in performance cars,

1956
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:13,420
they've reached this staggering level of
performance.

1957
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:16,660
At the highest end,
they have an American car now called the

1958
01:32:16,661 --> 01:32:17,980
challenger Hellcat.

1959
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:22,510
I drove one when I was in Denver.
It has 770 horsepower.

1960
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:26,530
It's fucking insane and it is a run of 
the mill,

1961
01:32:27,230 --> 01:32:30,670
not run of the mill,
but it's a standard production car.

1962
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,920
You,
you get it from a Chrysler dealership or

1963
01:32:32,921 --> 01:32:35,290
you go to a dodge dealership,
he pick up an srt,

1964
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:37,120
challenger it,
drive it off the lot.

1965
01:32:37,121 --> 01:32:39,310
You don't need to go to some flight 
school.

1966
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:44,460
You don't need to show any incredible 
proficiency with high performance 

1967
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:47,881
engines and they have cars now that 
regularly hit zero to 60 in less than 

1968
01:32:49,211 --> 01:32:54,211
three seconds,
less than three seconds and they're 

1969
01:32:54,211 --> 01:32:55,120
going 60 miles an hour.
That's insane.

1970
01:32:55,300 --> 01:33:00,300
I mean this is far faster than race cars
have a couple of decades ago and it's 

1971
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:03,640
going to get faster and faster and 
faster and if eventually we're all going

1972
01:33:03,641 --> 01:33:05,800
to be driving like formula one race cars
around.

1973
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:11,040
I mean,
it's going to be that bizarre and it 

1974
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,690
exists in everything.
We're seeing it now in internet speeds.

1975
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:16,900
We're seeing it in processor speeds and 
computers when they.

1976
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:20,500
When they eventually do go public with 
quantum computing,

1977
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,600
it's going to reach an entirely new 
level.

1978
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:24,610
I don't even understand quantum 
computing.

1979
01:33:24,611 --> 01:33:29,611
I've read several articles on it,
tried to wrap my head around what the 

1980
01:33:29,611 --> 01:33:30,640
fuck it means.
I don't get it,

1981
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:35,850
but apparently in my crude understanding
of it is they're going to be able to 

1982
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:40,930
create computers that aren't just 10 
times stronger than the,

1983
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:42,610
you know,
this Mac book I'm using,

1984
01:33:42,611 --> 01:33:47,611
but a million times or 10 million times 
or 100 million times where they have 

1985
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:52,480
processing power that is literally 
unimaginable.

1986
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:57,600
Like we will get to a point again,
whether it's 100 years or 500 years from

1987
01:33:58,271 --> 01:34:03,271
now,
we're going to get to a point where we 

1988
01:34:03,271 --> 01:34:05,140
are masters of the universe where we 
literally become gods.

1989
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:10,320
We become an entity that has the ability
to manipulate all matter all the time 

1990
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:16,930
and my issue with that is when this gets
into the hands of everyday folks,

1991
01:34:17,290 --> 01:34:22,290
we have a problem already in this 
country with guns and the problem is 

1992
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:25,531
mostly people with mental health.
The gun problem in this country is not 

1993
01:34:25,571 --> 01:34:29,200
nearly as bad as people think it is.
This is what I mean by that.

1994
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:32,980
There are 350 million people in this 
country.

1995
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:36,850
The amount of actual mass shootings we 
have is very rare.

1996
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,070
When you consider how many people have 
guns.

1997
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:40,900
These are.
It's a mental health issue,

1998
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:45,880
but the issue is you're giving a one 
individual who is mentally ill,

1999
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:48,820
they have the ability to get in control 
of this device,

2000
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:52,000
a gun which can cause all sorts of 
incredible damage.

2001
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:55,030
What happens when it's not,
you're not talking about a gun,

2002
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:57,770
you're talking about something that 
manipulate matter.

2003
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:02,920
You're talking about something that has 
the ability to radically transform the 

2004
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:07,160
environment in some sort of a way that 
this responsibility

2005
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:10,580
can't be it.
It can't be

2006
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:12,690
overemphasized.
It's it's.

2007
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:18,140
We could get to a point where an average
human being has the ability to create 

2008
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:19,690
worlds.
We,

2009
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:23,490
with the average human being,
has the ability to completely alter life

2010
01:35:23,491 --> 01:35:26,490
as we know it for everyone else who 
exists on this planet,

2011
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:28,350
whether that's a thousand years from 
now,

2012
01:35:28,351 --> 01:35:30,990
whether it's 500 years from now,
if we keep going,

2013
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:36,170
were these technologies will eventually 
getting into the hands of regular 

2014
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:36,960
people?
How do we stop that?

2015
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:40,950
I mean,
how do we stop doing is that is the real

2016
01:35:40,951 --> 01:35:43,950
question.
Do we concentrate on mental health?

2017
01:35:43,951 --> 01:35:48,951
Do we concentrate on,
on getting people to live in harmony and

2018
01:35:50,101 --> 01:35:52,560
peace before we create all these 
technologies?

2019
01:35:52,650 --> 01:35:57,240
Or do we sort of figure it out as we go 
along and have it catch up?

2020
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:01,550
Well,
that's a lot of question.

2021
01:36:01,551 --> 01:36:01,940
No,
no,

2022
01:36:01,941 --> 01:36:04,900
but again,
this is back to why I had,

2023
01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:09,970
was trying to do the transhumanist party
is that I'm trying to introduce these 

2024
01:36:09,970 --> 01:36:11,600
concepts into politics because for 
example,

2025
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:13,310
I just was reading an article and they 
said,

2026
01:36:13,311 --> 01:36:18,311
you know,
the average kid can go spend a thousand 

2027
01:36:18,311 --> 01:36:20,680
dollars on Ebay and create this kind of 
very professional microbiology lab in 

2028
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:24,971
his bedroom where he could then launch 
potentially very dangerous diseases if 

2029
01:36:25,821 --> 01:36:28,670
he knows what he's doing.
And I thought the thousand dollars,

2030
01:36:28,671 --> 01:36:33,671
you know,
a 20 years ago that would have been 

2031
01:36:33,671 --> 01:36:35,570
$100,000,
so no one would have had access to it 

2032
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:37,841
except you know,
and these are the kinds of things where 

2033
01:36:37,841 --> 01:36:38,930
I don't think a lot of government 
agencies,

2034
01:36:38,931 --> 01:36:41,600
politicians are actually thinking about.
They're just saying,

2035
01:36:41,601 --> 01:36:46,601
oh,
we'll push that off to some other day 

2036
01:36:46,601 --> 01:36:46,601
because it's so crazy.
But it's really not that crazy anymore.

2037
01:36:46,601 --> 01:36:51,220
What's happening is more and more people
are getting more and more access to 

2038
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:53,150
power and that's why hackers,
for example,

2039
01:36:53,151 --> 01:36:58,151
might be able to at some point in the 
future bring down entire systems if 

2040
01:36:58,151 --> 01:36:59,400
they're able to do that.
So you know,

2041
01:36:59,420 --> 01:36:59,880
your,
your,

2042
01:36:59,881 --> 01:37:02,630
your questions on how do we stop that?
Do we try to make everyone,

2043
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:04,220
you know,
live in harmony.

2044
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:10,120
I'm not a big believer that because to 
make them live in harmony is probably 

2045
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,740
too.
We've tried that for ages,

2046
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,570
you know,
programs that make everyone live better.

2047
01:37:14,571 --> 01:37:16,520
We're too competitive as,
as a species.

2048
01:37:16,521 --> 01:37:21,521
I think you need to use technology to 
not only advance the species but sort of

2049
01:37:21,771 --> 01:37:23,930
to protect the species.
And this,

2050
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:26,520
this is difficult because I,
I try,

2051
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:31,660
I try to hold some libertarian values 
and those values include not impeding a 

2052
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,440
technology,
not impeding the right to use the things

2053
01:37:36,441 --> 01:37:36,890
you want.

2054
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:41,890
But I think that technology can really 
help guide us if we use it.

2055
01:37:43,071 --> 01:37:45,080
Like everyone talks about surveillance 
for example,

2056
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:46,360
and how,
you know,

2057
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:48,800
all of a sudden we live in this great 
surveillance world.

2058
01:37:48,801 --> 01:37:53,801
We're,
everything we're doing is tracked and 

2059
01:37:53,801 --> 01:37:54,410
watched and there's all these cameras.
But the reality is actually,

2060
01:37:54,411 --> 01:37:59,411
if you look at it,
a lot of the surveillance has made the 

2061
01:37:59,411 --> 01:37:59,990
world safer and better for,
uh,

2062
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:01,710
for our children,
for ourselves.

2063
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:07,040
And yet we still,
a lot of us have the freedoms that I 

2064
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:07,040
think we all want it.
I mean,

2065
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,880
I still feel like a very free person 
almost all the time,

2066
01:38:08,881 --> 01:38:10,410
not happy paying taxes,
whatever,

2067
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:15,680
everyone else the same way.
But the bottom line is we live in a 

2068
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,691
pretty free world and that's technology 
has made it safer at the same time 

2069
01:38:18,811 --> 01:38:20,520
without really compromising our 
freedoms.

2070
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:25,760
I think we can continue going down that 
path where we can use technology to 

2071
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:31,550
continue to monitor people,
a monitor the kinds of things that make 

2072
01:38:31,801 --> 01:38:34,200
it very dangerous for an individual to 
get,

2073
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:39,320
you know,
a subtype of power in his hands that we 

2074
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:39,320
can remake universities or whatever.

2075
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:43,970
Or just the microbiology lab where he 
creates a virus and then releases it 

2076
01:38:43,970 --> 01:38:47,211
into the water supply.
I think we can use technology to stop 

2077
01:38:47,211 --> 01:38:47,211
that.
But at the same time,

2078
01:38:47,211 --> 01:38:50,100
I think we can use technology to grow 
the species as a whole.

2079
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:55,260
It's a very fine balance because we're 
probably going to have to give up some 

2080
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:57,951
freedoms.
We're probably going to have to accept 

2081
01:38:57,951 --> 01:38:57,951
that,
um,

2082
01:38:57,951 --> 01:38:59,610
this idea of absolutely no government or
this idea of too much government,

2083
01:38:59,611 --> 01:39:04,611
you know,
governments are going to have to change 

2084
01:39:04,611 --> 01:39:07,101
as technology grows,
technology is going to be leading 

2085
01:39:07,101 --> 01:39:07,620
governments from here on out.
It's tech,

2086
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:11,010
it's government's gonna have to look to 
technology to find their solutions.

2087
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:12,090
Not,
oh well,

2088
01:39:12,091 --> 01:39:14,370
let's use technology on occasion to 
solve this.

2089
01:39:14,590 --> 01:39:18,030
Um,
technology is in the driver's seat and I

2090
01:39:18,031 --> 01:39:20,970
don't think a lot of people realize that
anymore.

2091
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:26,120
They think they're in the driver's seat 
or they think we can still control that 

2092
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:26,120
all.

2093
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:30,350
But the reality is our life is so 
determined by the amount of structure 

2094
01:39:30,350 --> 01:39:33,420
that progress and technology has put in 
our lives.

2095
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:37,140
It's no escaping it anymore and yet it's
done very good thing.

2096
01:39:37,141 --> 01:39:40,260
So I think we need to continue with it 
and put more of our faith into it.

2097
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:44,510
And that might mean more regulation,
more observance,

2098
01:39:44,530 --> 01:39:49,530
more tracking.
Eventually we're all going to be 

2099
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:49,530
interconnected with chips.
So this idea of,

2100
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:50,280
you had mentioned earlier,
maybe in 10 years you'll be able to read

2101
01:39:50,281 --> 01:39:51,780
my thoughts.
I have,

2102
01:39:51,781 --> 01:39:54,180
um,
recently put on some of the,

2103
01:39:54,181 --> 01:39:59,181
uh,
the head reading equipment and done a 

2104
01:39:59,181 --> 01:40:01,101
few articles on it.
The brainwave reading stuff is 

2105
01:40:01,101 --> 01:40:04,011
fascinating.
I'm a singularity university professor 

2106
01:40:04,011 --> 01:40:04,011
Jose credential.
Uh,

2107
01:40:04,011 --> 01:40:08,460
we were at the world future society.
I'm in Florida a few months ago speaking

2108
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:13,461
together and he said,
so spoken language won't be here in 20 

2109
01:40:13,461 --> 01:40:13,461
years.

2110
01:40:13,461 --> 01:40:17,820
Bice said spoken language won't be here.
So I did an article on that and he said,

2111
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,200
look,
brainwave.

2112
01:40:19,230 --> 01:40:21,420
He works at Singularity University as a 
professor there.

2113
01:40:21,421 --> 01:40:25,260
Any brainwave technology is increasing 
so quickly in the last two years.

2114
01:40:25,261 --> 01:40:28,440
It's jumped in another two years.
It's going to jump in 10 years.

2115
01:40:28,441 --> 01:40:30,210
We're going to have the ability and you 
know,

2116
01:40:30,211 --> 01:40:32,640
just last year or I guess it's about 
eight months ago,

2117
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:37,980
a man in a person in India and a person 
in France had the telepathy thoughts and

2118
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,170
they were without saying a word to each 
other.

2119
01:40:40,171 --> 01:40:41,880
He said hello.
And the other one said Chow.

2120
01:40:41,881 --> 01:40:46,680
And that's just the start in five years 
everything is going to.

2121
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:48,690
Can you explain that technology to 
folks?

2122
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:53,870
Sure.
So basically it uses this egg 

2123
01:40:53,870 --> 01:40:54,040
technology,
which is a very complicated word to say,

2124
01:40:54,041 --> 01:40:59,041
but I'll just say it's that technology 
and essentially the brain creates 

2125
01:40:59,041 --> 01:41:03,121
certain types of waves when you have 
certain types of thoughts and various 

2126
01:41:03,121 --> 01:41:06,810
places of the body and very various 
places of the brain and the headgear you

2127
01:41:06,851 --> 01:41:09,970
have can read it and it knows based on 
algorithms,

2128
01:41:09,971 --> 01:41:11,770
based on a lot of repetitious practices.

2129
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:14,860
If you're thinking like fly a helicopter
for example,

2130
01:41:14,861 --> 01:41:19,861
the army is working on flying 
helicopters with using these brainwave 

2131
01:41:19,861 --> 01:41:19,861
headsets.
It nose lift,

2132
01:41:19,861 --> 01:41:24,720
it knows,
turned left and knows turn right based 

2133
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:24,720
on the soldiers,
you know,

2134
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,440
repeated like saying okay.
Experimenting and saying okay,

2135
01:41:26,441 --> 01:41:31,441
this always means the same thing and 
they've put it so good together that 

2136
01:41:31,441 --> 01:41:33,100
they know when you say hello and they 
know when you say goodbye now.

2137
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:38,460
And if you can send that to another 
person and then it can stimulate that 

2138
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:41,710
person the same way.
It's able to an a very basic level right

2139
01:41:41,711 --> 01:41:46,711
now.
Tell that person that what you feel or 

2140
01:41:46,711 --> 01:41:46,711
what you,
what you actually said,

2141
01:41:46,711 --> 01:41:49,810
except it comes through in that feeling 
and your thoughts and I'm not,

2142
01:41:49,870 --> 01:41:51,880
I'm not a scientist,
I'm not doing it very eloquently,

2143
01:41:51,881 --> 01:41:56,881
but that's the basic structure of it.
And the idea is eventually we'll have 

2144
01:41:57,491 --> 01:42:02,491
signals going in and signals coming out 
that ultimately can make us here these 

2145
01:42:03,101 --> 01:42:04,540
things in our head,
you know,

2146
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:06,220
I mean we're hearing stuff in her head 
right now,

2147
01:42:06,221 --> 01:42:11,221
but we're doing through our senses,
but if we bypass the census and just go 

2148
01:42:11,221 --> 01:42:12,850
right to the neurons and stimulate them,
it'd be the same thing.

2149
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:14,770
And that's essentially what they're 
trying to do with that,

2150
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:18,280
with that type of technology.
It's very primitive right now,

2151
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:23,460
but it's growing so fast and there's a 
huge amount of people that think the 

2152
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:25,780
brainwave reading headsets will become 
the next iphone technology,

2153
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:26,770
which is,
you know,

2154
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:31,980
why,
why do we need an iphone when you can 

2155
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:31,980
just wear this little device in your 
head and you're like,

2156
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:32,480
tell your,
you know,

2157
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:34,900
tell your wife this or tell you,
you know,

2158
01:42:34,901 --> 01:42:37,540
I want to take out pizza here.
I want to reserve a flight,

2159
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,660
you know,
we're going to have Siri that's going to

2160
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:44,670
be much more improved in a few years and
all these things will be digitally just 

2161
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:46,180
done through your thoughts.
So you know,

2162
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:51,450
this singularity professor who I totally
believe said we probably won't be 

2163
01:42:52,421 --> 01:42:54,240
speaking to each other.
We'll be at,

2164
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:59,380
we'll be at a conference and everyone 
will be plugged in and you'll be 

2165
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:02,140
thinking these things because it's a lot
easier just to think it and you know,

2166
01:43:02,230 --> 01:43:05,080
and is that different than what we're 
doing right now with our headsets,

2167
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:06,490
like I said,
the ears,

2168
01:43:06,491 --> 01:43:07,150
the interface.

2169
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:12,150
But if you just go right to brainwaves 
and stimulate those places in the brain 

2170
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:14,230
that know how to recognize it will learn
this new form of communication.

2171
01:43:14,690 --> 01:43:16,210
My article is based on,
um,

2172
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:21,690
whether,
whether we'll need second languages 

2173
01:43:21,690 --> 01:43:23,440
because google translate already 
translates things instantaneously.

2174
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:28,740
So,
and I suffered through six years of 

2175
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:29,380
Spanish and I've been working on trying 
to teach my daughter Chinese and Spanish

2176
01:43:29,381 --> 01:43:30,610
right now and I,
my wife,

2177
01:43:30,611 --> 01:43:31,180
and are like,
yes,

2178
01:43:31,181 --> 01:43:32,320
we must go through it.
But I said,

2179
01:43:32,321 --> 01:43:34,180
well,
do we really need to,

2180
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:39,240
what if we all have headsets that do 
instant translations with anyone on the 

2181
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:39,910
planet through our thoughts?
You know,

2182
01:43:39,911 --> 01:43:41,590
and this is the kind of thinking where 
it's like,

2183
01:43:41,591 --> 01:43:46,591
wow,
that's real transunion thinking because 

2184
01:43:46,591 --> 01:43:46,591
maybe all second languages will die out.
We will.

2185
01:43:46,591 --> 01:43:50,310
We'll just go to one language.
In my book I talk about bond,

2186
01:43:50,530 --> 01:43:55,530
which is there's various types of 
languages out there that are better for 

2187
01:43:55,530 --> 01:44:00,280
communicating a scientific ideas or 
logical ideas and they don't consider,

2188
01:44:00,861 --> 01:44:05,861
you know,
English has all sorts of imperfections 

2189
01:44:05,861 --> 01:44:06,740
in it and that's why it's sometimes 
difficult to learn in.

2190
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:11,740
Most languages have imperfections,
but a couple of scientists have worked 

2191
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:14,060
on other forms of languages that are 
much more easier,

2192
01:44:14,061 --> 01:44:16,460
for example,
to program into a computer.

2193
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:21,910
There's types of languages that a 
computer can process a lot more simply 

2194
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:22,220
than,
for example,

2195
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:27,250
English.
If you're trying to teach a computer a 

2196
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:29,250
language and because you know there's 
feminists and a masculine types of 

2197
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:33,560
endings and things like that that can 
trick things if they're irregular,

2198
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:35,960
but certain languages don't have any 
irregular things.

2199
01:44:35,961 --> 01:44:37,880
And so scientists worked on these 
languages,

2200
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:42,320
but the idea is that eventually we might
arrive in 20 years at a perfect language

2201
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:47,530
that we'll all use.
It'd be our communication will be a lot 

2202
01:44:47,530 --> 01:44:47,530
quicker and more expedient,
simpler,

2203
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,480
and um,
it'll all be done through brainwaves and

2204
01:44:50,481 --> 01:44:50,840
uh,
you know,

2205
01:44:50,841 --> 01:44:52,310
the world will be a very different 
place.

2206
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:57,370
I mean,
think of it without just one single 

2207
01:44:57,370 --> 01:44:57,370
language,
just thinking about things.

2208
01:44:57,370 --> 01:44:58,940
So it'll be some sort of tower of Babel 
type shit.

2209
01:44:58,941 --> 01:45:03,510
We're going to have that inside of our 
head with some technological

2210
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:08,540
Lee created translation device that 
allows us to utilize this universal 

2211
01:45:09,381 --> 01:45:11,810
language that computers create.
My,

2212
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:14,440
I feel so dumb just listening to this.
My,

2213
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:16,430
my mouth is starting to unconsciously

2214
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:20,200
go slack.
I'm glazing over and I talk about it,

2215
01:45:20,201 --> 01:45:22,870
but I don't know any of the ins and outs
of it because the kind of,

2216
01:45:22,871 --> 01:45:27,871
you know,
the question of like how technically do 

2217
01:45:27,871 --> 01:45:29,731
they do this?
The scientists that are working on this 

2218
01:45:29,731 --> 01:45:31,270
have spent their entire lives on this 
and the other scientists that are trying

2219
01:45:31,271 --> 01:45:33,370
to look into it don't even know what 
they're doing.

2220
01:45:33,371 --> 01:45:36,640
And they're experts on it and then you 
have people like myself discussing it's,

2221
01:45:36,970 --> 01:45:38,440
it's amazing,
but you know,

2222
01:45:38,710 --> 01:45:40,240
it's true that it happened.
And that's,

2223
01:45:40,270 --> 01:45:45,270
I think the more important thing is that
they're developing these things and 

2224
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:46,080
especially these brainwave reading 
technologies.

2225
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:49,150
There's now a number of companies that 
are selling it and I'm sure at the local

2226
01:45:49,151 --> 01:45:50,800
target and uh,
you know,

2227
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:51,970
that's already here.

2228
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:57,240
God,
that is so crazy.

2229
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:02,760
But she's so hard to wrap their mind 
around the potential of something like 

2230
01:46:04,651 --> 01:46:05,240
that.
Some,

2231
01:46:05,370 --> 01:46:06,510
some sort of an bit.
I mean,

2232
01:46:06,511 --> 01:46:09,630
if you think about like what originally 
what Morse code was,

2233
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:10,620
did he did,
did,

2234
01:46:10,621 --> 01:46:11,120
did,
did,

2235
01:46:11,121 --> 01:46:11,780
did,
did,

2236
01:46:11,781 --> 01:46:12,110
did.

2237
01:46:12,270 --> 01:46:17,270
And now you know,
you send a text message and now you can 

2238
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:17,430
talk into your phone and send a text 
message.

2239
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:18,500
I have,
um,

2240
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:19,680
uh,
you know,

2241
01:46:19,681 --> 01:46:22,740
they have that google voice thing that 
you can,

2242
01:46:22,741 --> 01:46:24,240
um,
or uh,

2243
01:46:24,870 --> 01:46:26,160
not,
not google voice,

2244
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:28,470
but you could use google voice does 
work.

2245
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:30,540
Well,
you could ask Google questions,

2246
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,000
but I have this,
um,

2247
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:33,600
this,
uh,

2248
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:38,630
application on my phone with the iphone.
It's a notepad and I,

2249
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:43,850
when I have ideas when I'm in my car,
I just talked to the phone and it 

2250
01:46:43,850 --> 01:46:47,811
transcribes it and it's almost perfect 
except for weird words and it doesn't 

2251
01:46:47,811 --> 01:46:50,280
understand generally like if you said to
it,

2252
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:55,730
concentrate on new technology that makes
sure that people can see like eagles,

2253
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:58,630
it'll do that and make it perfect.
I'm gonna.

2254
01:46:58,650 --> 01:47:00,330
Have you ever messed with it?
No,

2255
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:02,050
I haven't,
but I've seen it like,

2256
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:02,580
watch this.

2257
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:06,390
We'll do it right now because it's just,
it's just so crazy how good it's gotten.

2258
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:08,610
Like you just press this little button 
right here.

2259
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:14,930
Concentrate on new technology that 
allows people to see as well as eagles 

2260
01:47:15,601 --> 01:47:17,670
do.
Bam.

2261
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:20,880
Perfect.
Absolutely perfect.

2262
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:24,150
Absolutely perfect.
And I just talked like a normal person I

2263
01:47:24,151 --> 01:47:29,151
talked to,
like I would normally if I was trying 

2264
01:47:29,151 --> 01:47:29,151
to,
you know,

2265
01:47:29,151 --> 01:47:32,180
send a message to someone who was trying
to communicate to someone and it takes 

2266
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:32,180
it and it's doing it right now while I'm
doing that.

2267
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,590
Wow,
that's incredible.

2268
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:35,840
You should,
uh,

2269
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:40,850
you should type in the Google the mine,
waive reading post photos to twitter,

2270
01:47:42,541 --> 01:47:47,541
you know,
they now have devices where you can 

2271
01:47:47,541 --> 01:47:49,161
actually post directly to twitter and 
facebook by thinking it based on those 

2272
01:47:49,161 --> 01:47:50,370
devices I was just telling you about.
That's incredible.

2273
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:55,500
My thought was the difference between 
Morse code,

2274
01:47:55,501 --> 01:47:58,110
which they created a language teacher 
did,

2275
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:58,710
did,
did,

2276
01:47:58,711 --> 01:47:59,460
did,
did it it,

2277
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:02,890
they had to create a certain amount of 
sounds that may mean an ass,

2278
01:48:02,990 --> 01:48:05,040
a certain amount of sounds that mean a 
zero,

2279
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:10,280
you know,
there was all these different or an o 

2280
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:10,280
rather.

2281
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,920
There's all these different sounds that 
correspond with letters and then you had

2282
01:48:13,471 --> 01:48:18,471
a piece that together and create a 
language out of it or create a word out 

2283
01:48:18,471 --> 01:48:20,280
of it.
Now you're able to just say the word and

2284
01:48:20,281 --> 01:48:25,281
it transcribes it,
but eventually if this technology comes 

2285
01:48:25,281 --> 01:48:28,341
to fruition and you'll have a thought 
and that thought will be transcribed to 

2286
01:48:28,341 --> 01:48:29,610
a universal language that someone in 
India,

2287
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:34,020
someone in Zaire,
someone in South America,

2288
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:36,990
anyone anywhere,
no matter what they speak,

2289
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:42,650
we'll use this language and it's 
possible that there won't be any other 

2290
01:48:42,650 --> 01:48:43,980
languages other than this,
you know,

2291
01:48:43,981 --> 01:48:47,820
like we used to.
Cursive used to be standard.

2292
01:48:48,050 --> 01:48:49,890
I mean,
I had alert at growing up,

2293
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,870
um,
my kids don't know it.

2294
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:57,050
They don't know what it is.
My daughter is six and they don't teach 

2295
01:48:57,050 --> 01:49:00,500
cursive anymore.
It's gone and they're going to typing 

2296
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:01,620
will be gone to typing.

2297
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:05,370
Probably by the time my 11 month old 
gets to six.

2298
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:10,550
I'm wondering if they're going to even 
do typing because a lot of it will 

2299
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:12,840
eventually just be what you said,
verbally speaking or thinking,

2300
01:49:13,170 --> 01:49:13,730
you know,
and,

2301
01:49:13,810 --> 01:49:15,210
and it's all,
it's amazing.

2302
01:49:15,211 --> 01:49:18,570
All these technologies that we thought 
were so breakthrough eventually get to a

2303
01:49:18,571 --> 01:49:20,430
point when they're so obsolete and you 
think,

2304
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:25,700
and then you try to tell a younger 
person what it was like and they just 

2305
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:25,920
look at you like,
I don't get it.

2306
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:29,610
Why did you do that?
Do you have a voice navigation system on

2307
01:49:29,611 --> 01:49:31,360
your car?
Um,

2308
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:33,870
no,
I just use everything on my iphone.

2309
01:49:34,150 --> 01:49:36,240
I'm for a transhumanist.
I'm not very,

2310
01:49:36,241 --> 01:49:38,590
uh,
high tech with that side,

2311
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:40,530
just like talking about it.
No,

2312
01:49:40,531 --> 01:49:43,410
but I don't actually have that much 
technology in my house.

2313
01:49:43,411 --> 01:49:45,000
In fact,
we don't even have a television.

2314
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:48,120
You don't have a television now,
you know,

2315
01:49:48,121 --> 01:49:49,900
we just.
How do you watch TV then?

2316
01:49:50,210 --> 01:49:51,820
Have,
we don't have a TV.

2317
01:49:51,821 --> 01:49:55,450
We just uh,
we watched dvds and stuff like that on a

2318
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:56,360
computer,
you know,

2319
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:58,810
we have a big giant screen.
We just don't,

2320
01:49:58,811 --> 01:50:01,720
we have no TV whatsoever.
Not even local access.

2321
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:02,380
Oh,
I see.

2322
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:07,420
So you have a big TV,
you just don't have cable or satellite.

2323
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:12,760
Yeah.
So with the Internet we just use the 

2324
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:12,760
Internet for everything and it's just 
kind of like.

2325
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:17,050
It's funny because I think TV is one of 
those things where for 30,

2326
01:50:17,051 --> 01:50:19,120
40,
50 years it was such a mainstay and then

2327
01:50:19,121 --> 01:50:23,110
all of a sudden you're trying to teach 
your kids and say,

2328
01:50:23,111 --> 01:50:24,730
well they hear it at school and they're 
like,

2329
01:50:24,731 --> 01:50:27,400
well we don't have it.
It's not nearly necessary anymore,

2330
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:32,880
you know?
And eventually I'm not even sure a big 

2331
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:32,880
giant screen TV will be necessary.

2332
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:37,320
Might just be,
well I guess one thing that you carry 

2333
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:37,840
around or an eye and a ipad or something
like that.

2334
01:50:37,841 --> 01:50:42,841
I mean it's constantly in flux and 
that's the great thing about it is just 

2335
01:50:42,841 --> 01:50:42,841
constantly changing.
I mean,

2336
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:44,580
um,
yeah.

2337
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:49,590
I wonder if will you know,
if in five years you'll be using a 

2338
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:52,171
laptop for what you're doing now,
might just be using probably be 

2339
01:50:52,171 --> 01:50:54,130
something more projected from a hologram
or something like that from the ceiling.

2340
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:56,470
Yeah.
I've seen those and I've seen the,

2341
01:50:56,471 --> 01:50:57,080
you know,
the,

2342
01:50:57,081 --> 01:51:02,081
the new watches that exists,
like on like a little bit of a fitbit 

2343
01:51:02,081 --> 01:51:06,541
thing and it projects an image on your 
wrist and you could touch it and play 

2344
01:51:06,541 --> 01:51:09,640
with it the same way that you would like
a touchscreen on a,

2345
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:13,180
on an actual phone.
I mean this following that I have now,

2346
01:51:13,181 --> 01:51:18,181
I got this big iphone,
I have an iphone and I also have this 

2347
01:51:18,181 --> 01:51:18,850
big Samsung Galaxy s five.

2348
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:24,210
And with both of them they're so big and
so good that I oftentimes I go on the 

2349
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:25,330
road,
I don't use a laptop anymore.

2350
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:28,670
I answer all my emails on this,
on the Samsung and it's just,

2351
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:33,490
it's plenty big for images.
It's plenty big for a web surfing.

2352
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:37,090
The only reason I even use a laptop is 
because the companies make,

2353
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:42,120
it's another programs actually work with
each other and sometimes the laptop is 

2354
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:42,250
the only way to make it,
you know,

2355
01:51:42,251 --> 01:51:47,251
with the sock flash and stuff like that.
And they do that purposely because they 

2356
01:51:47,251 --> 01:51:48,520
want you to buy as many gadgets as 
possible.

2357
01:51:48,521 --> 01:51:48,970
But,
you know,

2358
01:51:48,971 --> 01:51:50,590
eventually they'll,
uh,

2359
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:51,450
you know,
I,

2360
01:51:51,451 --> 01:51:56,451
I heard something like 30 years worth of
technology now fits into an iphone,

2361
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:58,810
you know,
30 years because you can watch movies on

2362
01:51:58,811 --> 01:52:00,340
it,
you can music on it,

2363
01:52:00,341 --> 01:52:02,530
you can do all your,
if you're in math class,

2364
01:52:02,531 --> 01:52:04,570
you can do your calculators and stuff 
like that.

2365
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:08,440
And television is now on an iphone,
so that's how small it's gone.

2366
01:52:08,650 --> 01:52:11,350
But I bet another 30 years it's going to
get to something you're the size of your

2367
01:52:11,351 --> 01:52:14,640
thumbnail and inside your head.
And uh,

2368
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:19,680
you know,
we'll have all this recording will be 

2369
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:19,750
done with no equipment.
Just probably be big giant tables.

2370
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:21,700
Yeah.
I remember my first computer,

2371
01:52:21,701 --> 01:52:26,440
I had some crappy Mac that I bought that
I don't even think it had a one gigabyte

2372
01:52:26,441 --> 01:52:28,120
hard drive.
I mean,

2373
01:52:28,121 --> 01:52:30,640
I don't think,
I don't think they existed back then.

2374
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:35,850
I got a computer in 1994 from comp USA,
which doesn't even exist anymore.

2375
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:39,730
And I,
I think I'm pretty sure it was less than

2376
01:52:39,731 --> 01:52:42,910
one gigabyte.
And then I remember in the future I,

2377
01:52:42,911 --> 01:52:46,010
I ordered a computer that had a four 
hard drive

2378
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:51,010
and I'm like,
this is fucking crazy for getting the 

2379
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:54,461
bites now my phone is a hundred and 28 
gigabytes and it's this little tiny 

2380
01:52:54,861 --> 01:52:59,861
narrow thing.
This has a case on it and it's narrow 

2381
01:52:59,861 --> 01:52:59,861
and it just slides right into your 
pocket.

2382
01:52:59,861 --> 01:53:02,780
It's got a 128 gigs,
you know in this one,

2383
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:06,620
the Samsung has cards,
you slide in new ones,

2384
01:53:06,621 --> 01:53:11,360
he can stick in 64 gigs,
128 gigs.

2385
01:53:11,361 --> 01:53:14,300
You can just keep sticking in little 
tiny SD cards.

2386
01:53:14,450 --> 01:53:19,450
They're so small and there are 128 gigs.
I mean it doesn't even make sense 

2387
01:53:19,450 --> 01:53:19,450
anymore.
And you know,

2388
01:53:19,450 --> 01:53:21,610
with the cloud,
the cloud is definitely where the future

2389
01:53:21,611 --> 01:53:22,190
is.
It's,

2390
01:53:22,370 --> 01:53:25,010
it's going to be no more gigabytes on 
our phones.

2391
01:53:25,011 --> 01:53:30,011
Everything will just be interconnected.
Will all have these floating big giant 

2392
01:53:30,011 --> 01:53:31,720
databases above us.
And I already am,

2393
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:36,730
use the cloud for a lot of my stuff 
because I do a lot of videos and photos 

2394
01:53:36,730 --> 01:53:39,110
of the kids and it just adds up too much
space on the actual phone.

2395
01:53:39,610 --> 01:53:40,760
And uh,
and I realized that,

2396
01:53:40,761 --> 01:53:42,260
you know,
you could run programs,

2397
01:53:42,490 --> 01:53:44,590
you can just run entire computers in the
cloud now,

2398
01:53:45,190 --> 01:53:50,190
you know,
it's just all about the new programs 

2399
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:52,511
coming out and eventually everything 
will just be probably a hologram screen 

2400
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:54,490
connected to somewhere way up there.
What,

2401
01:53:54,530 --> 01:53:59,530
I mean,
it's obviously metaphorical but will be 

2402
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:01,670
interconnected that way without actually
even having much of a device.

2403
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:04,630
So yeah,
it's,

2404
01:54:04,631 --> 01:54:05,370
it's,
it's,

2405
01:54:05,410 --> 01:54:07,700
and that's probably five years away that
what I'm speaking about.

2406
01:54:07,701 --> 01:54:12,701
I mean,
I think the cloud is probably one the 

2407
01:54:12,701 --> 01:54:14,771
most heavily invested things of gadget 
technology that they're trying to do 

2408
01:54:14,771 --> 01:54:19,421
right now.
And eventually we'll all be 

2409
01:54:19,421 --> 01:54:19,421
interconnected to the story.
I just did an artificial hearts,

2410
01:54:20,030 --> 01:54:25,030
you know,
it's such an interesting story because 

2411
01:54:25,030 --> 01:54:27,221
they just did the second completely 
robotic artificial heart surgery on a 

2412
01:54:27,221 --> 01:54:31,301
patient in France and robotic hearts 
have been around for 10 or 15 years or 

2413
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:32,270
maybe even 20.

2414
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:34,080
But they were always,
um,

2415
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:37,190
a way to keep someone alive until they 
found a transplant heart,

2416
01:54:37,310 --> 01:54:40,850
but they're now starting to do robotic 
hearts that replace the real heart.

2417
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:46,180
And that's it.
That's the only heart that person's 

2418
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:46,180
going to have for the rest of his life 
or her life.

2419
01:54:46,370 --> 01:54:50,360
It's so far been two guys and I'm so.
We've just,

2420
01:54:50,361 --> 01:54:55,361
in the last 12 months,
we've crossed that with now robotic 

2421
01:54:55,361 --> 01:54:56,210
hearts are no longer just a temporary 
replacement.

2422
01:54:56,211 --> 01:55:01,160
They are the final replacement and 
they're all Wifi,

2423
01:55:01,290 --> 01:55:02,360
uh,
uh,

2424
01:55:02,420 --> 01:55:03,830
in,
they all have wifi.

2425
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:07,190
Things about in my article is like,
if you want to be in a fight,

2426
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:09,890
you could pump up your heart with your 
cell phone,

2427
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:12,470
for example,
if you're in the ring and then you could

2428
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:16,070
fight that much better if I'm a surfer 
and big waves or if you want to meditate

2429
01:55:16,071 --> 01:55:17,360
or sleep,
you know,

2430
01:55:17,361 --> 01:55:18,330
you could put it to sleep.

2431
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:19,700
Boats,
you're heart goes slower,

2432
01:55:19,970 --> 01:55:24,970
you know,
instead of these are the ways you're 

2433
01:55:24,970 --> 01:55:24,970
going to be able to control the 
technology in your life.

2434
01:55:24,970 --> 01:55:25,850
And the interesting thing I found about 
the,

2435
01:55:25,851 --> 01:55:26,540
uh,
the,

2436
01:55:26,541 --> 01:55:31,541
uh,
the story I did was Dick Cheney or the 

2437
01:55:31,541 --> 01:55:34,571
former vice president had this kind of 
little device that was attached to one 

2438
01:55:34,571 --> 01:55:34,571
of his,
uh,

2439
01:55:34,571 --> 01:55:36,530
the valves in his heart and uh,
I don't know if you'd read,

2440
01:55:36,531 --> 01:55:40,730
but he was actually afraid of terrorist 
attacks because that was wifi controlled

2441
01:55:40,731 --> 01:55:43,190
as well.
That was an episode of homeland.

2442
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:48,440
Yeah.
Know they used that kind of technology 

2443
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:49,560
to hack into someone's heart.
So the technology is coming.

2444
01:55:49,561 --> 01:55:54,561
It's crazy,
but they're going to start doing that 

2445
01:55:54,561 --> 01:55:54,561
and when people are actually really 
worrying about that kind of stuff too,

2446
01:55:54,561 --> 01:55:58,260
it's actually here today and I'm so,
you know,

2447
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:00,210
it's just a totally brave new world.

2448
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:05,210
But it's also pretty awesome because 
when you think of the possibilities of 

2449
01:56:05,210 --> 01:56:06,300
having a robotic heart and now you want 
to go,

2450
01:56:06,330 --> 01:56:07,520
for example,
uh,

2451
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:12,860
you want to be a go free diving.
I like free diving and you want to go 

2452
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:13,500
down as far as you can,
maybe a couple hundred feet.

2453
01:56:13,810 --> 01:56:18,810
Um,
this is the kind of time you could 

2454
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:18,810
program your heart to actually work with
you.

2455
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:23,240
Like I said,
do you want to sleep or do yoga or even 

2456
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:23,240
have sex,
you know what I mean?

2457
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:26,630
All of a sudden you could program your 
heart to be a different person than you 

2458
01:56:26,630 --> 01:56:27,180
might've been normally.
Well,

2459
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:32,260
that was one of the things in trance,
a transcendental man where they were 

2460
01:56:32,851 --> 01:56:37,851
talking about the potential using 
nanobots or artificial blood cells,

2461
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:40,920
the you'd be able to hold your breath 
under water for an hour,

2462
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:43,380
just just,
you know,

2463
01:56:43,410 --> 01:56:46,080
just using these artificial blood cells 
that get created.

2464
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:48,090
They just.
Yeah.

2465
01:56:48,091 --> 01:56:53,091
This last year was one of the big things
for that where they now have some kind 

2466
01:56:53,091 --> 01:56:53,670
of injection when,
for example,

2467
01:56:53,671 --> 01:56:58,020
someone has a been a drought for 30 
minutes and they can inject it into your

2468
01:56:58,021 --> 01:57:03,021
blood supply.
It's one of the first things that are 

2469
01:57:03,021 --> 01:57:03,021
trying to put forth that they can now do
it in an accident like that,

2470
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:08,090
but it works in the same way.
We're allows you to hold oxygen in your 

2471
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:09,210
body a lot longer than you normally 
would have.

2472
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:10,810
And so of course,
yeah.

2473
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:16,060
You know,
one of my very first opening articles 

2474
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:16,060
after the book was on the transhumanist 
Olympics,

2475
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:21,200
and this is this idea that instead of 
having so many strict regulations 

2476
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:26,061
regarding drug control and what 
technology you can use during real 

2477
01:57:26,061 --> 01:57:27,700
competition,
why not make it competition where you,

2478
01:57:27,701 --> 01:57:31,170
anything goes,
we're weightlifters can use any types of

2479
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:33,450
enhancers and,
uh,

2480
01:57:33,451 --> 01:57:38,451
you know,
and athletes can use any type of 

2481
01:57:38,451 --> 01:57:38,670
technology they get their hands on and 
uh,

2482
01:57:38,671 --> 01:57:39,690
you know,
it's crazy because,

2483
01:57:39,691 --> 01:57:41,430
for example,
if you did this thing with,

2484
01:57:41,490 --> 01:57:43,140
um,
you know,

2485
01:57:43,141 --> 01:57:46,770
the oxygen cells,
maybe all swim races will be underwater.

2486
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:48,630
It's considered that,
you know,

2487
01:57:48,631 --> 01:57:50,430
all of a sudden you can be,
you know,

2488
01:57:50,431 --> 01:57:55,431
one can go underwater long enough.
That's why sometimes when you see 

2489
01:57:55,431 --> 01:57:55,431
backstrokers,
I used to be a swimmer.

2490
01:57:55,431 --> 01:57:57,210
They kick as far as they can under water
because they can go faster.

2491
01:57:57,211 --> 01:58:02,211
There's less resistance problems.
No one can hold their breath long 

2492
01:58:02,211 --> 01:58:02,211
enough.
And so all of a sudden,

2493
01:58:02,211 --> 01:58:03,690
if you could do that,
it could change the face of swimming.

2494
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:08,990
Um,
and the same thing can happen with 

2495
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:08,990
almost any sport that you think of,
especially powerlifting,

2496
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:11,460
when you actually need a burst of 
energy,

2497
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:12,990
instead of lifting what they're lifting 
now,

2498
01:58:12,991 --> 01:58:17,991
they might be able to lift three or four
times that with steroids that are just 

2499
01:58:17,991 --> 01:58:19,320
designed for it to give you 10 seconds 
of just pure rage.

2500
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:24,450
But the problem with that is what we 
look for in competition,

2501
01:58:24,451 --> 01:58:29,451
what we look for in sports is someone 
transcending the ability of the average 

2502
01:58:29,451 --> 01:58:33,651
person with discipline and focus and 
drive and will that they work really 

2503
01:58:35,011 --> 01:58:37,950
hard and concentrate really hard on 
their technique.

2504
01:58:38,370 --> 01:58:41,620
And then they get to some point where 
there a Michael Jordan or some

2505
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:45,250
Olympic power lifter.
If you could just program it in,

2506
01:58:45,251 --> 01:58:50,251
what would be the point of watching it?
We would like to eliminate a lot of the 

2507
01:58:50,251 --> 01:58:54,570
really magical moments in sport because 
we're going to create a bunch of super 

2508
01:58:54,570 --> 01:58:55,360
athletes,
but on the other hand,

2509
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:57,250
if you don't do it,
you know,

2510
01:58:57,251 --> 01:59:02,251
my take on it is going to be that we're 
going to be able to manipulate 

2511
01:59:02,251 --> 01:59:04,980
biological bodies in a way where you're 
going to be able to literally create an 

2512
01:59:06,251 --> 01:59:11,251
incredible hulk like someone is going to
be that and if we're watching athletes 

2513
01:59:11,251 --> 01:59:13,600
that are totally natural and have all 
these limitations,

2514
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:16,450
but your mailman can jump over your 
fucking house.

2515
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:19,660
Like we're going to be bored with 
regular sports.

2516
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:25,020
They're not going to have the ability.
But W who is going to watch football if 

2517
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:25,560
everybody's the hulk,
you know,

2518
01:59:25,580 --> 01:59:30,580
I mean if you have a team of 16 hulks on
one side and 16 hawks and the other and 

2519
01:59:31,121 --> 01:59:33,160
it's all about moving a ball across the 
line.

2520
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:38,160
I mean,
what kind of a fucking world are we 

2521
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:38,160
going to be living in?
And I think that's,

2522
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:39,700
you know,
from just even a commercial perspective.

2523
01:59:39,701 --> 01:59:44,701
That's why I liked the idea of having 
two separate types of sporting 

2524
01:59:44,701 --> 01:59:44,701
endeavors.
For example,

2525
01:59:44,701 --> 01:59:47,230
you have the stuff we have now because I
totally agree with you.

2526
01:59:47,231 --> 01:59:50,290
I've been an athlete my whole life.
Did water polo through college and stuff

2527
01:59:50,291 --> 01:59:52,180
like that.
The idea is,

2528
01:59:52,450 --> 01:59:57,450
you're right,
the whole point of it is that I worked 

2529
01:59:57,450 --> 01:59:57,450
my butt off and I got.
I was good at it,

2530
01:59:57,450 --> 01:59:57,450
you know,
and.

2531
01:59:57,730 --> 02:00:02,730
But it's kind of cheating if someone 
gets to take a drug just because the 

2532
02:00:02,730 --> 02:00:02,740
scientists developed it and he had more 
money and that,

2533
02:00:02,741 --> 02:00:04,540
you know,
to do it and then they're better.

2534
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:09,900
And that's why I think maybe two fields 
could be created like one transhumanist 

2535
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:10,690
Olympics won Olympics,
whatever it is,

2536
02:00:10,691 --> 02:00:11,660
sporting cheap.

2537
02:00:12,230 --> 02:00:14,760
The regular people would pretend,
well yeah,

2538
02:00:14,930 --> 02:00:18,010
not transhumanist cheat mean that's what
you have.

2539
02:00:18,011 --> 02:00:22,180
And I mean that was the big argument 
about Lance Armstrong.

2540
02:00:22,210 --> 02:00:24,430
Lance Armstrong got busted cheating and 
they,

2541
02:00:24,431 --> 02:00:27,340
they,
they took away his tour de France wins,

2542
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:32,580
but if you want to go back to the person
that hasn't tested positive for drugs on

2543
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:39,960
the Tour de France,
you got to go back to like 17th place 

2544
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:41,850
because everybody was cheating.
So it gets to this point where like,

2545
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:46,450
is it cheating and everybody's cheating 
or is it just some unfortunate aspect of

2546
02:00:46,451 --> 02:00:51,010
this competition that people don't admit
what they need to do in order to be able

2547
02:00:51,011 --> 02:00:52,450
to race like this?
Well,

2548
02:00:52,510 --> 02:00:57,510
I think everything will,
if you do go the transhumanist 

2549
02:00:57,510 --> 02:01:00,460
competition route,
everything was sort of become like race 

2550
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:02,830
car competition where you have a really 
good driver but then you have engineers 

2551
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,900
behind him that make the vehicle so that
he can get that far.

2552
02:01:08,130 --> 02:01:13,130
And.
And that's part of the cool thing is 

2553
02:01:13,130 --> 02:01:14,971
like you're like,
well he has this engineer from Porsche 

2554
02:01:14,971 --> 02:01:17,221
or whatever,
and they become sort of celebrities or 

2555
02:01:17,221 --> 02:01:17,221
you know,
in the transhumanist Olympics world,

2556
02:01:17,221 --> 02:01:20,050
I think scientists would maybe become 
celebrities as much as,

2557
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:23,110
or you know,
become popular figures because you would

2558
02:01:23,111 --> 02:01:23,710
really say,
well,

2559
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:29,040
he's the one who made this athlete and 
the athlete and this athlete do all 

2560
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:29,880
those records.
So it would be kind of different.

2561
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:33,370
I think maybe even a different word 
should be used.

2562
02:01:33,371 --> 02:01:38,371
It wouldn't be sports anymore,
it might be something new because it 

2563
02:01:38,371 --> 02:01:40,040
would be something so different.
You would be taking the coaches and the

2564
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:43,550
engineers and scientists behind that 
athlete to a whole nother level.

2565
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:47,110
Yeah.
What would that be?

2566
02:01:47,111 --> 02:01:52,111
I mean,
I think part of what we love about 

2567
02:01:52,111 --> 02:01:53,380
sports is the fact that we know it's so 
difficult to become a great athlete.

2568
02:01:53,620 --> 02:01:58,270
It involves like the dedication of like 
go back to the movie rocky.

2569
02:01:58,420 --> 02:02:03,420
Like one of the things that people loved
about it was that he got up when he was 

2570
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:03,420
tired,
he hit that alarm clock.

2571
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:05,680
He drank the raw eggs,
went jogging,

2572
02:02:05,681 --> 02:02:10,681
you know,
he was doing all these things that he 

2573
02:02:10,681 --> 02:02:12,151
didn't want to do to push his body to 
reach this level of fitness that allowed

2574
02:02:12,701 --> 02:02:16,250
him to go and fight Apollo creed.
You know,

2575
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:21,400
a guy who really was out of his league.
He rose the occasion with hardwell and 

2576
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:26,281
to heart and will and determination and 
hard work that that's what excites us 

2577
02:02:27,191 --> 02:02:31,450
about sports is that we know it's hard 
to do if it becomes easy to do.

2578
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:35,920
I mean if the average person can go to 
some transhumanism clinic and get a shot

2579
02:02:35,921 --> 02:02:38,590
of nanobots and become,
you know,

2580
02:02:38,950 --> 02:02:40,420
some ultra man,
some,

2581
02:02:40,510 --> 02:02:45,510
some,
some person that has capabilities far 

2582
02:02:45,510 --> 02:02:48,050
beyond your normal biological body.
We,

2583
02:02:48,110 --> 02:02:49,810
you know,
we might lose interest.

2584
02:02:49,990 --> 02:02:50,830
We might lose interest.

2585
02:02:51,650 --> 02:02:52,350
No,
you're right.

2586
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:53,080
But you know,
the,

2587
02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:58,090
the,
the problem is what you said and you 

2588
02:02:58,090 --> 02:02:58,090
nailed right on the head when you said,
well,

2589
02:02:58,090 --> 02:03:02,000
what are you going to do in the mail?
Man is a better basketball player than 

2590
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:02,730
Michael Jordan.
Just because he's on these,

2591
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:04,990
you know,
he's taking these things or you know,

2592
02:03:05,070 --> 02:03:07,920
a 10 year old who puts on a certain 
exoskeleton suit,

2593
02:03:07,921 --> 02:03:10,530
just runs as faster than a horse and 
then,

2594
02:03:10,531 --> 02:03:15,531
you know,
it doesn't matter what if you're in 

2595
02:03:15,531 --> 02:03:15,531
Olympia Olympia,
a sprinter it,

2596
02:03:16,230 --> 02:03:21,230
I'm sorry,
but aren't sports kind of silly in that 

2597
02:03:21,230 --> 02:03:21,230
sense.
I mean we're concentrating on this,

2598
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:26,010
this thing that we talk about this,
this competition aspect of our lives,

2599
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:30,410
but if we reached some incredible 
transcendent point in,

2600
02:03:30,411 --> 02:03:30,970
in,
in the

2601
02:03:31,170 --> 02:03:33,270
physical abilities of people because of 
technology,

2602
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:35,550
does it really?
The sport really matter anymore.

2603
02:03:35,790 --> 02:03:40,790
I mean it's kind of a silly thing to 
concentrate on about this being the one 

2604
02:03:40,790 --> 02:03:44,211
thing that we're going to lose.
Like who gives a shit if that ball goes 

2605
02:03:44,211 --> 02:03:44,211
in that net,
you know,

2606
02:03:44,211 --> 02:03:45,730
he made a basket.
Woo.

2607
02:03:45,910 --> 02:03:47,490
Does it really change the world?
No.

2608
02:03:47,670 --> 02:03:52,670
Or is it far more impressive that the 
average person no longer has the 

2609
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:54,630
limitations that the biological body?

2610
02:03:55,540 --> 02:03:55,960
Yeah.
No,

2611
02:03:55,961 --> 02:03:56,610
I mean I,
I,

2612
02:03:56,700 --> 02:03:59,380
I think to some extent probably.
Well,

2613
02:03:59,410 --> 02:04:01,870
you know,
I guess when we care for,

2614
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:06,880
I don't think sports will fade away 
because sports has become one of the 

2615
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:09,370
greatest methods that people use to 
become great,

2616
02:04:09,371 --> 02:04:14,371
you know,
that it's one of the inspiring events 

2617
02:04:14,371 --> 02:04:16,891
that we have as a species that brings us
together and so it's hard to see that 

2618
02:04:16,891 --> 02:04:21,001
going away.
But I guess if everyone has access to 

2619
02:04:21,001 --> 02:04:23,641
this incredible technology,
they may not be necessarily like so 

2620
02:04:23,641 --> 02:04:24,670
involved in it right now.
For example,

2621
02:04:24,671 --> 02:04:27,340
the Super Bowl is one of America's big 
giant events.

2622
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:32,520
I'd never,
I don't really understand why it's that 

2623
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:32,520
way,
but um,

2624
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:34,270
it's hard to see that changing anytime 
soon.

2625
02:04:34,271 --> 02:04:38,220
Even if we get really crazy access to 
technology somehow that's become

2626
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:40,290
kind of part of our culture,
these,

2627
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,270
this type of competitive,
friendly,

2628
02:04:42,271 --> 02:04:43,650
competitive,
uh,

2629
02:04:43,740 --> 02:04:46,590
you know,
endeavors that we do.

2630
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:49,310
The World Cup just came in.
I remember that was like when,

2631
02:04:49,311 --> 02:04:52,740
when do you actually have so many people
all thinking of the same thing?

2632
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:57,290
Well,
isn't like steroids and you know,

2633
02:04:57,300 --> 02:05:00,540
and even supplements to that to a 
certain extent,

2634
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:04,950
aren't they essentially look low level 
engineering of the human body.

2635
02:05:04,951 --> 02:05:09,951
I mean it's,
it's like a low level genetic 

2636
02:05:09,951 --> 02:05:12,711
engineering.
I mean that's what you're doing when 

2637
02:05:12,711 --> 02:05:14,751
you're adding steroids,
you're adding a chemical to a system 

2638
02:05:14,751 --> 02:05:15,870
that forces that system perform and 
exemplary matter.

2639
02:05:15,871 --> 02:05:18,420
That's really not possible without the 
steroids.

2640
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:20,710
Now it's totally.
I think it's totally fine.

2641
02:05:20,770 --> 02:05:21,380
Yeah,
it's.

2642
02:05:22,110 --> 02:05:24,960
They may say it's unnatural,
but what is unnatural?

2643
02:05:24,961 --> 02:05:28,680
I mean in today's Day and age,
everything is on natural shit.

2644
02:05:28,770 --> 02:05:29,990
Everything's on natural.
Well,

2645
02:05:29,991 --> 02:05:31,370
I mean every grading it.

2646
02:05:31,780 --> 02:05:32,970
It's true.
If you will.

2647
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:34,690
Where the fuck did that come from?
Well,

2648
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:37,170
from a certain perspective,
everything is kind of like,

2649
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:38,970
you know,
if it comes from certain elements,

2650
02:05:38,990 --> 02:05:39,810
it's,
it's there,

2651
02:05:39,811 --> 02:05:40,800
it's natural.
Use it.

2652
02:05:40,801 --> 02:05:42,920
What if you use it,
if it's useful and functional,

2653
02:05:42,921 --> 02:05:47,921
well,
isn't everything that human beings 

2654
02:05:47,921 --> 02:05:49,401
create?
In fact natural because we are natural 

2655
02:05:49,401 --> 02:05:50,310
and we have.
We have a built in curiosity and a built

2656
02:05:50,311 --> 02:05:53,160
in thirst and hunger for innovation.
That is.

2657
02:05:53,620 --> 02:05:58,620
I mean,
how much different is that than a 

2658
02:05:58,620 --> 02:05:59,460
natural animal that for just for food.
I mean that is what they do.

2659
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:04,510
I mean,
it is natural that they dig a hole in 

2660
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:04,510
the ground and find the routes that 
they're looking for,

2661
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:06,240
the,
the animals that they want to eat.

2662
02:06:06,750 --> 02:06:08,430
All these things are natural.
I invest.

2663
02:06:08,431 --> 02:06:09,660
Why I,
I've been.

2664
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:10,710
Everyone says,
oh,

2665
02:06:10,711 --> 02:06:14,710
so zoltan the transhumanism stuff you're
doing is so unnatural.

2666
02:06:14,750 --> 02:06:19,750
I say actually,
it's potentially the most natural thing 

2667
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:19,750
that you know,
we have done.

2668
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:23,610
Becoming robots might actually be a 
incredibly natural process,

2669
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:26,070
uh,
for human beings one day.

2670
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:27,120
And uh,
you know,

2671
02:06:27,121 --> 02:06:28,230
that's just,
it's evolution.

2672
02:06:28,231 --> 02:06:31,420
So how can it not be a natural thing?
But you know,

2673
02:06:31,430 --> 02:06:32,760
just,
it's all perception.

2674
02:06:32,850 --> 02:06:34,590
And if people want to twist it and say,
oh,

2675
02:06:34,591 --> 02:06:39,591
it's just too weird for me,
it's not in any way that it's just too 

2676
02:06:39,591 --> 02:06:39,591
weird for them.
It's not in any,

2677
02:06:39,591 --> 02:06:43,080
like big statements saying that it's 
unnatural for us to transform ourselves.

2678
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:48,260
Whether we're creating steroids,
whether we're putting microchips inside 

2679
02:06:48,260 --> 02:06:51,471
her head or whether we're just putting 
on an exoskeleton suit and climbing 

2680
02:06:51,471 --> 02:06:52,190
Mount Everest.
I mean this,

2681
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:57,200
these are,
they're always going to be natural 

2682
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:59,181
things.
I wish people would see that technology 

2683
02:06:59,181 --> 02:07:01,020
more as a natural phenomenon rather than
some type of like,

2684
02:07:01,170 --> 02:07:05,460
outside thing that comes in as an alien 
and that we're slowly started using,

2685
02:07:05,730 --> 02:07:10,730
you know,
I think if you had told someone a 

2686
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:10,730
century go,
hey,

2687
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:14,841
we're all going to be interconnected on 
the cell phone and this and this 

2688
02:07:14,841 --> 02:07:16,350
internet and we're going to be doing 
video conferencing across the oceans.

2689
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:18,410
Uh,
people would have looked at you and said

2690
02:07:18,990 --> 02:07:20,420
he's got mental problems.
You know,

2691
02:07:20,421 --> 02:07:22,590
it's crazy.
And now everyone does it.

2692
02:07:22,591 --> 02:07:22,920
I mean,
I,

2693
02:07:22,921 --> 02:07:26,130
I know they have cell phones and some of
the poorest villages in Africa.

2694
02:07:27,790 --> 02:07:29,730
It's incredible how far it's come and 
it,

2695
02:07:30,090 --> 02:07:32,490
there's nothing unnatural about it.
It's in fact,

2696
02:07:32,491 --> 02:07:35,980
it's just amazing stuff that's going to 
keep getting more

2697
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,980
amazing.
That's the one thing that gives me the 

2698
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:43,141
most hope about technology is that 
somehow or another it will raise up the 

2699
02:07:43,141 --> 02:07:47,431
level of the quality of life for people 
that live in poor areas.

2700
02:07:48,430 --> 02:07:52,090
And the cell phone is a perfect example 
of that.

2701
02:07:52,091 --> 02:07:56,030
It used to be Gordon Gecko on the beach 
with that big ass brick phone in,

2702
02:07:56,031 --> 02:07:57,160
you know,
in Wall Street.

2703
02:07:57,370 --> 02:07:58,570
And that was like,
wow,

2704
02:07:58,571 --> 02:08:01,750
this guy's got access to a phone and 
he's walking on the beach.

2705
02:08:01,870 --> 02:08:04,390
This is super high tech and now you 
know,

2706
02:08:04,391 --> 02:08:07,150
I've been to Brazil and seen people in 
the favelas,

2707
02:08:07,151 --> 02:08:10,100
in these poor neighborhoods that have 
cell phones and have smartphones,

2708
02:08:10,180 --> 02:08:15,180
iphones or android phones.
And this is becoming more and more 

2709
02:08:15,671 --> 02:08:18,610
prevalent all throughout the world in 
Africa and all these different places.

2710
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:23,960
Um,
I think the quality of life and as far 

2711
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:28,111
as the access to health care as far as 
the ability to communicate with each 

2712
02:08:28,111 --> 02:08:31,180
other as far as the access to modern 
comforts,

2713
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:36,600
that's the one thing that gives me the 
most hope about the exponential growth 

2714
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:37,930
of technologies that I hope it elevates.

2715
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:41,740
The quality of life for the people that 
are stuck in the lowest one percent,

2716
02:08:41,741 --> 02:08:42,880
five percent,
10 percent,

2717
02:08:42,881 --> 02:08:45,700
whatever it is in the world.
That slowly,

2718
02:08:45,701 --> 02:08:49,090
that life will be a far better,
far less suffering,

2719
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:50,470
far,
far,

2720
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:53,710
far easier existence.
And that they,

2721
02:08:54,040 --> 02:08:57,670
in fact with this technology can 
concentrate on other things because the,

2722
02:08:57,671 --> 02:09:02,671
uh,
the technology frees up a lot of 

2723
02:09:02,671 --> 02:09:04,261
resources and they'll,
it allow them to raise up their quality 

2724
02:09:04,261 --> 02:09:04,810
of life,
raise up their education,

2725
02:09:05,050 --> 02:09:07,510
raise up their healthcare,
raise up their government,

2726
02:09:07,511 --> 02:09:10,810
like all of these things will in fact 
raise the.

2727
02:09:10,930 --> 02:09:15,070
We look at Africa as a perfect example.
We look at the Congo,

2728
02:09:15,071 --> 02:09:20,071
which is this incredibly rich area in 
terms of resources but incredibly poor 

2729
02:09:20,620 --> 02:09:23,320
in terms of the quality of life for the 
people that lived there.

2730
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:28,520
And if we could somehow or another raise
that up where like the people that live 

2731
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:33,391
in the Congo have the same quality of 
life as the people that live in the 

2732
02:09:33,391 --> 02:09:33,391
average American city city.

2733
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:35,200
You would have a radically different 
world,

2734
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:37,000
a radically different world.
I mean,

2735
02:09:37,001 --> 02:09:41,320
it would change everything like that.
That could be one of the biggest changes

2736
02:09:41,321 --> 02:09:44,860
that technology brings in the world.
The elevation of the quality of life,

2737
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:47,500
of the average person on the planet.
No,

2738
02:09:47,501 --> 02:09:49,030
and I totally agree.
In fact,

2739
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:54,360
it's one of the big reasons I'm such a 
big proponent or a promoter of the 

2740
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:55,840
Internet because the one thing the 
Internet has done,

2741
02:09:55,850 --> 02:09:59,230
I did a huge amount of reporting,
I think 13 or 14,

2742
02:09:59,240 --> 02:10:03,190
you know,
a Muslim or Middle Eastern countries for

2743
02:10:03,191 --> 02:10:05,380
National Geographic.
I went to various places and,

2744
02:10:05,381 --> 02:10:06,520
um,
it,

2745
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:12,540
the great thing about the Internet is 
it's offered a sense of democracy and 

2746
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:14,020
even though a lot of those places still 
don't really have it.

2747
02:10:14,021 --> 02:10:16,480
This is why we had some of the uprisings
I think recently,

2748
02:10:16,481 --> 02:10:20,380
is that you get enough people on the 
Internet and they find out things.

2749
02:10:20,410 --> 02:10:21,430
They're like,
wow,

2750
02:10:21,431 --> 02:10:24,730
this is what some person is doing in Los
Angeles.

2751
02:10:24,731 --> 02:10:29,731
Why don't we do that here?
And that's happened because there's 

2752
02:10:29,731 --> 02:10:32,860
computers or cell phones that are slowly
appearing in these places that never had

2753
02:10:32,870 --> 02:10:33,620
access to that.

2754
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:39,100
It's inevitable to stay in your culture,
especially if it's kind of some type of 

2755
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:43,691
authoritarian culture.
If you have access to that kind of 

2756
02:10:43,691 --> 02:10:44,870
information because it makes you upset 
and you're gonna,

2757
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:46,820
you're gonna revolt.
And that's brilliant.

2758
02:10:46,821 --> 02:10:51,821
That's why cell phones are so important.
And just even regarding the malaria 

2759
02:10:51,821 --> 02:10:52,100
thing we talked about earlier in the 
Solomon Islands,

2760
02:10:52,101 --> 02:10:56,090
one of the reasons so many people die 
from malaria is they can't get access to

2761
02:10:56,091 --> 02:11:01,091
the drugs.
But if you can call someone and have 

2762
02:11:01,091 --> 02:11:03,791
them,
a healthy person make the walk over the 

2763
02:11:03,791 --> 02:11:03,791
mountain,
they can bring you the drugs.

2764
02:11:03,791 --> 02:11:05,000
But the problem is,
in the past there's been no way to call.

2765
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:10,390
There's no telephone lines,
but cell phones have enabled that to 

2766
02:11:10,390 --> 02:11:13,631
happen.
Cell phones is one of the main reasons 

2767
02:11:13,631 --> 02:11:13,631
that a lot of villages in Africa,
I'm sorry,

2768
02:11:13,631 --> 02:11:16,490
a lot of villages in Africa have cell 
phones for this reason,

2769
02:11:16,491 --> 02:11:21,491
for literally medical reasons so that 
people can come in and take out sick 

2770
02:11:21,491 --> 02:11:25,070
people when otherwise have to walk days 
just to get into,

2771
02:11:25,071 --> 02:11:26,540
you know,
to get them to help.

2772
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:27,710
And so,
I mean,

2773
02:11:27,890 --> 02:11:32,890
this kind of technology is literally 
changing the face of how especially poor

2774
02:11:33,201 --> 02:11:35,690
people live and making them live better 
longer.

2775
02:11:35,691 --> 02:11:38,900
And so that mortality rates are just,
everything's getting better.

2776
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:41,630
And I'm,
I'm totally hopeful that tech.

2777
02:11:41,631 --> 02:11:42,470
Everyone says,
oh,

2778
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:45,500
you know,
big brother for technology,

2779
02:11:45,501 --> 02:11:46,520
or uh,
you know,

2780
02:11:46,710 --> 02:11:49,430
it's a new world order.
I have a lot of conspiracy theorists had

2781
02:11:49,431 --> 02:11:52,550
always leave me threats,
but I keep saying that,

2782
02:11:52,551 --> 02:11:53,540
you know,
you threats,

2783
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:55,220
oh,
they leave me threats because I'm,

2784
02:11:55,221 --> 02:12:00,221
you know,
now saying a lot of stuff like I 

2785
02:12:00,221 --> 02:12:00,500
advocate for using microchips and 
people's heads and,

2786
02:12:00,710 --> 02:12:03,620
and using technology as means to improve
life,

2787
02:12:03,621 --> 02:12:06,800
but they think it's all part of the 
elite trying to control us.

2788
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:12,040
And I always say that,
but the fact is that all people around 

2789
02:12:12,040 --> 02:12:16,631
the world are getting more and more 
access to this technology that's 

2790
02:12:16,631 --> 02:12:16,670
improving their lives.

2791
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:18,860
You know,
if that's what the elite do.

2792
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:20,870
I'm not saying there's a lead behind 
anything,

2793
02:12:20,990 --> 02:12:25,990
but if that's what they do,
then that's a good thing because it's 

2794
02:12:25,990 --> 02:12:26,270
happened that way.
It's not an elite thing.

2795
02:12:26,271 --> 02:12:31,271
It just happens to be that it costs a 
lot of money to develop technology at 

2796
02:12:31,271 --> 02:12:32,510
first and it takes a few years to 
trickle down.

2797
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:37,570
Maybe it takes a few decades,
but history has shown that most 

2798
02:12:37,570 --> 02:12:41,171
technology has trickled down from 
wherever it came from and that some of 

2799
02:12:41,171 --> 02:12:42,710
the poorest people in the world have 
access to a,

2800
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:46,670
to a lot of the development that has 
come through the pipeline.

2801
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:48,180
I had the,
uh,

2802
02:12:48,530 --> 02:12:53,530
a few weeks ago I debated John Zerzan.
He's the leading philosopher of the NRA.

2803
02:12:54,280 --> 02:12:56,900
I'm kind of capitalistic.
Well,

2804
02:12:57,080 --> 02:12:58,020
he,
he's a,

2805
02:12:58,830 --> 02:13:00,180
uh,
he's based gonna,

2806
02:13:00,190 --> 02:13:05,190
anti civilization philosopher.
He really advocates for going back to 

2807
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:08,900
entirely primitive lifestyle.
And uh,

2808
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:12,680
we had a debate at Stanford University 
and it went well.

2809
02:13:12,680 --> 02:13:13,910
He's a nice guy,
but he,

2810
02:13:13,911 --> 02:13:16,490
he,
he represents kind of the anarchists and

2811
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:22,210
my book has some anarchist theme so I 
can't completely disassociate myself 

2812
02:13:22,210 --> 02:13:24,800
from some of the radical and 
revolutionary ideas that are there.

2813
02:13:25,070 --> 02:13:30,070
But at the same time,
he advocates for things that would 

2814
02:13:30,290 --> 02:13:33,630
absolutely harm some of the poorest 
people in the world.

2815
02:13:33,780 --> 02:13:35,060
Harm,
uh,

2816
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:39,540
basically everyone by giving up the 
things that have made us live longer and

2817
02:13:39,541 --> 02:13:43,170
better when you actually,
my wife is a doctor,

2818
02:13:43,171 --> 02:13:48,171
so she's done a lot of work in Africa.
When you take away technology and 

2819
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:53,300
medicine and modern science from the 
people,

2820
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:58,320
especially the poorest people,
they have a very hard time surviving.

2821
02:13:58,321 --> 02:14:03,321
They go right back to the way a lot of 
tribal people had lived for long times 

2822
02:14:03,321 --> 02:14:08,121
where people die from a cavity,
people die from the simplest of 

2823
02:14:08,121 --> 02:14:08,860
infections.
Um,

2824
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:11,310
we now have ways to deal with all of 
that.

2825
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:14,490
So lifespans are growing grain that just
growing in America,

2826
02:14:14,491 --> 02:14:19,491
they're growing all around the world.
They're growing in Africa and they are 

2827
02:14:19,491 --> 02:14:20,010
getting better.
So what does this guy want?

2828
02:14:20,130 --> 02:14:24,990
What does he want to happen?
So I'm like a primitive way of life.

2829
02:14:24,991 --> 02:14:25,540
Like,
yeah.

2830
02:14:25,580 --> 02:14:30,580
So he advocates,
he says that all harm came from 

2831
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:36,020
basically the development of technology 
and kind of,

2832
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:39,990
um,
basically when we lived in tribes and we

2833
02:14:39,991 --> 02:14:43,710
were in very communal tribes,
we were much happier as human beings.

2834
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:45,420
I've heard this shit so many times 
before.

2835
02:14:45,421 --> 02:14:47,100
It drives me bananas.
What's this dude's name?

2836
02:14:47,250 --> 02:14:50,460
John Zerzan,
spelled Z E R,

2837
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:55,880
z a n.
and we literally just had a big kind of 

2838
02:14:55,880 --> 02:14:57,210
public debate at Stanford University 
recently.

2839
02:14:57,211 --> 02:15:00,060
And it went well,
but it was a little bit crazy.

2840
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:03,210
The NRF has outnumbered the 
transhumanist in the auditorium,

2841
02:15:03,211 --> 02:15:05,740
like four to one.
It was a little bit sketchy actually.

2842
02:15:05,740 --> 02:15:07,410
And they're there.
The black bloc guys,

2843
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:07,900
you know,
the,

2844
02:15:07,910 --> 02:15:09,270
the,
you know,

2845
02:15:09,271 --> 02:15:14,271
the guys that go through the Oakland 
riots or when you have riots and they 

2846
02:15:14,271 --> 02:15:15,120
put it on the black stuff,
the black masks and whatnot.

2847
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:16,430
No.
Oh,

2848
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:17,690
you know,
whenever you see like the,

2849
02:15:17,691 --> 02:15:21,050
the World Trade Organization,
the people that kind of go to those,

2850
02:15:21,060 --> 02:15:22,710
they're called black black people.
They usually,

2851
02:15:22,730 --> 02:15:26,400
they try to make themselves completely 
anonymous and any was.

2852
02:15:26,401 --> 02:15:31,401
There are some of those guys there.
And it was a little bit sketchy because 

2853
02:15:31,401 --> 02:15:31,401
it was a,
it was a pretty heated.

2854
02:15:31,401 --> 02:15:36,320
These guys think that all transhumanists
are aiming to turn the world into 

2855
02:15:36,841 --> 02:15:39,330
robots.
So they actually feel quite angry.

2856
02:15:39,331 --> 02:15:40,170
They,
they really,

2857
02:15:40,171 --> 02:15:45,171
they're like,
you want to kill us by making us become 

2858
02:15:45,171 --> 02:15:46,290
different types of entities?
And Trans humanists say,

2859
02:15:46,291 --> 02:15:51,291
well,
you guys want to kill us by taking us 

2860
02:15:51,291 --> 02:15:51,291
back to a domestic,
you know,

2861
02:15:51,291 --> 02:15:55,080
into this kind of very primitive 
lifestyle where most of us couldn't 

2862
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:55,080
survive because we'd all starve.

2863
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:57,600
There's not enough hunter and gathering.
So they want to hunt.

2864
02:15:57,900 --> 02:15:59,580
Yes.
They want to take us back essentially to

2865
02:15:59,581 --> 02:16:01,960
a hunter and gatherer lifestyle.
And that's,

2866
02:16:01,990 --> 02:16:03,420
that's,
that's their platform.

2867
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:06,120
Yes.
That's 100 percent of their platform,

2868
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:08,240
the whole world hunter and gatherer 
hunter.

2869
02:16:08,290 --> 02:16:10,830
One hundred percent and the whole world.
But that doesn't work with 7 billion.

2870
02:16:10,870 --> 02:16:11,280
No,
no,

2871
02:16:11,281 --> 02:16:12,170
I know that.
And they,

2872
02:16:12,171 --> 02:16:17,171
they know that too.
Yet they advocate in the same way that 

2873
02:16:17,171 --> 02:16:17,260
like,
um,

2874
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:22,880
some people advocate things that they're
trying to make a point that technology 

2875
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:26,661
has made human beings unhappy.
And our point is that technology has 

2876
02:16:26,661 --> 02:16:28,410
made human beings live better and longer
and happier.

2877
02:16:28,710 --> 02:16:30,070
And so they advocate

2878
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:30,910
for that.
And it's a big,

2879
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:31,990
pretty big movement.
I mean,

2880
02:16:31,991 --> 02:16:33,570
there's certainly a lot bigger than 
transhumans.

2881
02:16:33,580 --> 02:16:35,800
So all these guys,
they hunt for their own food.

2882
02:16:35,801 --> 02:16:39,220
They know that vegetables,
they're all hypocrites in that sense.

2883
02:16:39,430 --> 02:16:44,430
And because even this is not criticism 
of there and there's really no way for,

2884
02:16:45,460 --> 02:16:50,460
for example,
for to even get a Mr Jersey on to a 

2885
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:54,290
debate.
He had to fly in from Oregon to malaria.

2886
02:16:54,420 --> 02:16:57,340
We use speakers,
he wears clothes,

2887
02:16:57,670 --> 02:16:59,320
but he has a watch.
So anyways,

2888
02:16:59,321 --> 02:17:02,020
John Sears on is the,
he's the,

2889
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:05,670
he was the confidence of the unabomber 
and that's why he.

2890
02:17:05,710 --> 02:17:07,660
He's kind of taken over the unibomber 
position.

2891
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:09,090
He will,
he knew the unibomber.

2892
02:17:09,170 --> 02:17:14,170
He knew he was,
he was a good friend of his who was 

2893
02:17:14,170 --> 02:17:14,260
there during the entire court 
proceedings.

2894
02:17:14,290 --> 02:17:15,460
Oh,
fucking Christ.

2895
02:17:15,461 --> 02:17:18,100
So this is why I had a lot of threats 
because you know,

2896
02:17:18,101 --> 02:17:23,101
when you're debating him,
you're sorta debating some of the ideas 

2897
02:17:23,101 --> 02:17:23,101
of the unibomber who still has a large 
following.

2898
02:17:23,101 --> 02:17:24,070
You know,
the UNIBOMBER,

2899
02:17:24,250 --> 02:17:27,190
they screwed his mind up.
And the Harvard Lsd Studies,

2900
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:28,990
I actually don't know that much about 
him.

2901
02:17:29,020 --> 02:17:30,340
Oh my God.
This.

2902
02:17:30,410 --> 02:17:35,080
He was a part of those original lsd 
studies and I believe it was the sixties

2903
02:17:35,081 --> 02:17:39,400
before they made lsd illegal and they 
fucking torched that guy's brain.

2904
02:17:39,670 --> 02:17:40,360
I mean,
they,

2905
02:17:40,390 --> 02:17:45,390
they,
Harvard did a bunch of series of 

2906
02:17:45,390 --> 02:17:48,360
experiments on people with LSD and the 
results of those experiments are all 

2907
02:17:48,360 --> 02:17:50,770
classified,
but there's a documentary called the net

2908
02:17:50,980 --> 02:17:55,980
that went into great detail.
I believe it was a German documentary 

2909
02:17:55,980 --> 02:17:56,920
that talked about,
but it's very public.

2910
02:17:56,921 --> 02:18:01,921
It's public knowledge that he was 
involved in the Harvard lsd studies and 

2911
02:18:01,921 --> 02:18:04,960
it's very likely that they cooked his 
fucking brain with extraordinary,

2912
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:10,140
extraordinarily large doses of Lsd in 
these clinical settings and who knows 

2913
02:18:10,390 --> 02:18:12,670
what kind of tests they ran on these 
guys and.

2914
02:18:13,030 --> 02:18:18,030
But he came out of that,
went to Berkeley and made enough money 

2915
02:18:18,030 --> 02:18:21,010
essentially teaching just to be able to 
build this house,

2916
02:18:21,130 --> 02:18:26,130
this little small cabin up in the woods 
and start his plan to murder people who 

2917
02:18:26,130 --> 02:18:27,670
were involved in the creation of 
technology.

2918
02:18:27,930 --> 02:18:32,930
I mean the fact that anybody could leave
out that just look only purely at his 

2919
02:18:33,131 --> 02:18:38,131
philosophy and leave out the fact that 
they cook this guy's brain on acid and 

2920
02:18:38,131 --> 02:18:42,721
who knows what kind of dosages.
I mean if you go back to some of the 

2921
02:18:42,721 --> 02:18:47,701
studies that they did in the 19 fifties 
with soldiers and they did studies with 

2922
02:18:47,701 --> 02:18:47,701
housewives,
they,

2923
02:18:47,701 --> 02:18:51,220
there was varying doses like to give 
people a couple,

2924
02:18:51,930 --> 02:18:56,350
you know,
like what would be the average hit,

2925
02:18:56,530 --> 02:18:58,330
what you would call a couple of hits of 
acid.

2926
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:00,130
Now I don't know what the actual dosage 
would be,

2927
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:02,380
but they would give them 100 hits,
you know,

2928
02:19:02,381 --> 02:19:03,720
they would give them totally 
differently.

2929
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:09,020
They would cook their fucking brain with
this stuff and this guy came out of 

2930
02:19:09,020 --> 02:19:11,920
those studies and there's a direct link.
There has to be.

2931
02:19:12,130 --> 02:19:17,130
I mean there's a direct link to several 
people that have undergone large doses 

2932
02:19:17,130 --> 02:19:20,300
of LSD and severely diminished mental 
capacities afterwards.

2933
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:25,360
So really diminished abilities to 
rationalize reality to,

2934
02:19:25,660 --> 02:19:28,040
to view the world through same.
The

2935
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:30,890
same lens that they had before they took
it.

2936
02:19:31,070 --> 02:19:34,040
It really can fuck people's heads up and
this guy was one of them.

2937
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:39,280
So the fact that this guy is a proponent
of penske's ideas.

2938
02:19:41,330 --> 02:19:41,900
Yeah.
I mean,

2939
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:44,810
if you look at the worst case scenario,
you know,

2940
02:19:44,811 --> 02:19:46,430
the I,
robot scenario,

2941
02:19:46,431 --> 02:19:48,110
the,
the summoning,

2942
02:19:48,111 --> 02:19:52,130
the demon scenario put,
there is some potential that we could be

2943
02:19:52,131 --> 02:19:56,450
doing something horribly bad by creating
accelerating technology.

2944
02:19:56,600 --> 02:19:57,530
But if we don't,
what,

2945
02:19:57,700 --> 02:19:58,460
what did,
what are we doing?

2946
02:19:58,461 --> 02:20:00,440
We're limiting ourselves to being 
animals.

2947
02:20:00,590 --> 02:20:02,270
Well,
let's throw away fucking weapons.

2948
02:20:02,271 --> 02:20:04,370
Let's kill things with our face like 
Jaguars.

2949
02:20:04,371 --> 02:20:08,720
Do you want to go super low tech?
Because everything is technology.

2950
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:12,800
No fucking stone ax is technology course
so he doesn't eat.

2951
02:20:12,801 --> 02:20:15,350
It's funny enough,
he doesn't even advocate for a lot of.

2952
02:20:15,351 --> 02:20:20,351
He says domestic affairs and he doesn't.
So he was really good friends with for 

2953
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:26,040
awhile and then they had a falling out 
and in the process has become kind of 

2954
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:28,640
the leader of that movement since 
because key has been in prison,

2955
02:20:28,910 --> 02:20:33,910
we're probably not representing his 
ideas accurately but,

2956
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:37,280
but,
but so zero's and essentially you know,

2957
02:20:37,281 --> 02:20:37,970
he,
he,

2958
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:42,950
I think he knows what he's advocating 
would kill billions of people.

2959
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:48,220
However,
I think know his main message is that 

2960
02:20:48,220 --> 02:20:48,220
technology,
because for example,

2961
02:20:48,220 --> 02:20:50,540
he blames,
he says school shootings is our,

2962
02:20:50,541 --> 02:20:55,541
a result,
the increase of school shootings in 

2963
02:20:55,541 --> 02:20:57,641
America are a result of our discontent 
with technology and these are wanting 

2964
02:20:57,641 --> 02:20:59,450
some of the things we debated about it 
at Stanford.

2965
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:00,950
And um,
and I disagree.

2966
02:21:00,951 --> 02:21:02,750
I think there are anomalies in the 
system.

2967
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:04,970
Their mental health issues.
There are exactly.

2968
02:21:04,971 --> 02:21:08,450
And mental health issues happen for a 
number of reasons.

2969
02:21:08,660 --> 02:21:11,000
And you know,
perhaps the most,

2970
02:21:11,050 --> 02:21:16,050
you know,
if everyone has people with mental 

2971
02:21:16,050 --> 02:21:16,050
health have access to guns,
it just goes wrong sometimes.

2972
02:21:16,050 --> 02:21:20,670
Yeah.
And then the media explodes it and you 

2973
02:21:20,670 --> 02:21:20,690
know,
but ultimately I think,

2974
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:22,940
you know,
and a lot of people feel the same way,

2975
02:21:22,941 --> 02:21:27,941
that Sarah Sans ideas are way out there 
and he's not taking in the whole 

2976
02:21:28,521 --> 02:21:30,350
picture,
which is what I feel.

2977
02:21:31,550 --> 02:21:33,650
But at the same time,
you know,

2978
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:36,050
he,
he's in charge now,

2979
02:21:36,051 --> 02:21:37,970
or at least he's written a number of 
books,

2980
02:21:37,971 --> 02:21:42,971
were a lot of people follow for 
potentially millions of anarchistic 

2981
02:21:42,971 --> 02:21:44,330
around the world that are taking very 
serious issue with.

2982
02:21:44,570 --> 02:21:47,480
And so they have kind of are some of 
those same people that are now,

2983
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:49,620
I think they attacked recently a google 
bus,

2984
02:21:49,660 --> 02:21:54,660
a bus,
and there's been some other attacks 

2985
02:21:54,660 --> 02:21:57,730
including physical attacks.
I'm not exactly sure what happened with 

2986
02:21:57,730 --> 02:22:01,331
the Google bus.
I think there was some physical attacks 

2987
02:22:01,331 --> 02:22:01,331
with it,
but they're basically,

2988
02:22:01,331 --> 02:22:01,730
you know,
it's,

2989
02:22:01,810 --> 02:22:03,860
it's combined with the occupy movements.
It's,

2990
02:22:03,861 --> 02:22:06,530
it's all those sort of fringe groups are
starting to say,

2991
02:22:06,531 --> 02:22:08,780
well,
there's too much surveillance,

2992
02:22:08,781 --> 02:22:09,820
there's too much government.
Uh,

2993
02:22:09,821 --> 02:22:12,350
there's too much this,
there's too much technology involved.

2994
02:22:12,470 --> 02:22:15,050
And of course transhumanists are pitted 
sort of against it all.

2995
02:22:15,051 --> 02:22:19,280
Saying actually technology is improving 
the lives of everyone.

2996
02:22:19,281 --> 02:22:23,600
And you guys couldn't even send your 
text or do arrange any of your movements

2997
02:22:23,690 --> 02:22:26,220
without all this,
without

2998
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:28,740
all this technology.
So what's happened is,

2999
02:22:28,741 --> 02:22:33,741
ever since that moment,
I have been sort of under attack as the 

3000
02:22:33,741 --> 02:22:38,151
guy who went against their Zan and we're
probably going to have another public 

3001
02:22:38,151 --> 02:22:39,000
debate because him and I liked each 
other.

3002
02:22:39,001 --> 02:22:44,001
We were fine talking to each other.
Yet we represent totally extremes.

3003
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:47,430
And he really does advocate going back 
to a,

3004
02:22:47,440 --> 02:22:50,720
a,
a truly a hunter gatherer lifestyle.

3005
02:22:50,721 --> 02:22:52,420
He doesn't do that himself.
No,

3006
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:55,830
he doesn't hunt.
I grow my own food.

3007
02:22:55,831 --> 02:23:00,020
I grow vegetables.
I have chickens that I get eggs from and

3008
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:03,120
I hunt,
but I just don't think you can have.

3009
02:23:03,670 --> 02:23:06,330
It's not for everybody.
People don't want to.

3010
02:23:06,450 --> 02:23:08,490
My friend Steve Rinella,
who's the host of this show,

3011
02:23:08,491 --> 02:23:10,230
mediator.
It's a hunting show.

3012
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:12,600
He has a really great point.
He's like,

3013
02:23:12,690 --> 02:23:17,690
we've allowed.
Society has come up with all sorts of 

3014
02:23:17,690 --> 02:23:18,300
methods where we don't have to do 
everything.

3015
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:22,080
We don't have to be responsible for 
eliminating our own waste,

3016
02:23:22,140 --> 02:23:27,140
for getting rid of our own garbage.
We don't have to be responsible for 

3017
02:23:27,140 --> 02:23:29,901
digging a hole and burying it.
We don't have to be responsible for our 

3018
02:23:29,901 --> 02:23:30,920
own sewage system.
We don't have to do that anymore.

3019
02:23:30,930 --> 02:23:35,930
Society figured out a way,
like there's nothing wrong with a 

3020
02:23:35,930 --> 02:23:35,930
supermarket.
His idea is that,

3021
02:23:35,930 --> 02:23:38,400
yeah,
there is a disconnect when you just pick

3022
02:23:38,401 --> 02:23:42,690
up a piece of meat that's neatly wrapped
in Saran wrap and the little foam,

3023
02:23:42,870 --> 02:23:45,160
you know trey.
But that's,

3024
02:23:45,320 --> 02:23:48,750
that's a part of progress,
it's a part of civilization.

3025
02:23:48,900 --> 02:23:52,260
You can go back to hunting if you want.
It is an option,

3026
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:55,470
but it's very difficult to do and most 
people are not going to do it.

3027
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:58,110
And that's the reason I like it.
I like doing it.

3028
02:23:58,111 --> 02:24:00,600
It makes me feel connected to what I'm 
eating.

3029
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:05,600
But you don't have to do it.
There's nothing wrong with going to the 

3030
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:05,600
supermarket,
you know,

3031
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:05,600
and the,
the,

3032
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:08,220
this idea that we need to go back to a 
hunter gatherer lifestyle.

3033
02:24:08,550 --> 02:24:12,270
This is a short sided idea because that 
life fucking sucked.

3034
02:24:12,570 --> 02:24:13,480
You know,
people die,

3035
02:24:13,530 --> 02:24:15,090
they broke their legs and they were 
dead.

3036
02:24:15,460 --> 02:24:17,670
Get a cavity and they die from cavities.
I mean,

3037
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:20,160
it's just infections,
skin infections,

3038
02:24:20,190 --> 02:24:21,180
dead,
you know,

3039
02:24:21,181 --> 02:24:23,700
you had an open wound,
dead septic,

3040
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:26,190
dead,
no antibiotics,

3041
02:24:26,191 --> 02:24:27,690
no.
All that's technology.

3042
02:24:29,020 --> 02:24:29,470
It's,
I,

3043
02:24:29,650 --> 02:24:31,600
I find that incredibly shortsighted 
know,

3044
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:32,410
and I,
um,

3045
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:37,560
I have had the luck.
One of the ways I actually even got 

3046
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:39,960
involved with National Geographic 
because I had visited a tribe in Vanuatu

3047
02:24:39,961 --> 02:24:44,961
on my sail trip and I was the very first
a foreigner in this tribe in 1995 and 

3048
02:24:47,660 --> 02:24:52,660
they had never,
I think only two or three people had 

3049
02:24:52,660 --> 02:24:52,660
actually been off the hill or off the 
mountain.

3050
02:24:52,660 --> 02:24:57,561
There are a couple of mountains,
mountains to get through in this 

3051
02:24:57,561 --> 02:24:58,410
mountain range and been to the ocean and
seeing even a town.

3052
02:24:58,411 --> 02:25:03,411
So most that people had never seen 
anyone outside of people in their 

3053
02:25:03,411 --> 02:25:07,041
village.
And so I was the very first one to 

3054
02:25:07,041 --> 02:25:08,871
actually get access into this and I went
back later for National Geographic and 

3055
02:25:08,871 --> 02:25:12,681
filmed them.
But I have actually seen firsthand a 

3056
02:25:12,681 --> 02:25:16,821
truly indigenous and authentic tribe and
almost about 40 percent of the kids do 

3057
02:25:21,391 --> 02:25:24,400
not live until they're like twelfth or 
13th

3058
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:26,770
year because they die from various 
things.

3059
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:31,920
That's no way to run a society when you 
losing almost half of your population,

3060
02:25:32,290 --> 02:25:34,810
people you love because of stupid 
things.

3061
02:25:34,910 --> 02:25:36,750
Snakebites,
malaria,

3062
02:25:36,870 --> 02:25:38,230
uh,
disease.

3063
02:25:38,231 --> 02:25:38,680
Uh,
you know,

3064
02:25:38,681 --> 02:25:40,690
I mean stuff that we can deal with.
Well,

3065
02:25:40,691 --> 02:25:42,760
that's why primitive societies are so 
into fertility.

3066
02:25:42,761 --> 02:25:47,761
Rituals.
There were so incredible infant 

3067
02:25:47,761 --> 02:25:47,761
mortality rate.
It was just ridiculous,

3068
02:25:47,761 --> 02:25:47,761
you know,
I mean,

3069
02:25:47,761 --> 02:25:50,260
so much death and it's not a place to be
happy.

3070
02:25:50,261 --> 02:25:51,040
It's not a,
it's,

3071
02:25:51,220 --> 02:25:51,630
it's,
uh,

3072
02:25:51,740 --> 02:25:56,740
you know,
I remember I've never been in that 

3073
02:25:56,740 --> 02:25:56,740
village.
I've been there a couple times,

3074
02:25:56,740 --> 02:25:56,800
never been in that village when it 
wasn't in a state of mourning.

3075
02:25:56,980 --> 02:25:58,710
It's always in a state of mourning.
Mourning their,

3076
02:25:59,050 --> 02:26:01,470
their rights late last month,
[inaudible],

3077
02:26:01,550 --> 02:26:06,550
they're never going to be in a state of 
mourning because someone is always 

3078
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:07,000
dying.
And when you have a society like that,

3079
02:26:07,001 --> 02:26:12,001
it's incredibly difficult to come up 
with technological innovation because 

3080
02:26:12,001 --> 02:26:12,001
you're constantly worried about staying 
alive,

3081
02:26:12,001 --> 02:26:14,170
feeding your family,
fighting off the enemy,

3082
02:26:14,171 --> 02:26:16,960
whether it's an animal nature,
whatever it is.

3083
02:26:17,050 --> 02:26:17,590
Yeah.
No,

3084
02:26:17,591 --> 02:26:18,820
totally.
And this is,

3085
02:26:18,970 --> 02:26:20,390
it's like,
you know,

3086
02:26:20,410 --> 02:26:22,030
in our debate we,
I talked about this,

3087
02:26:22,031 --> 02:26:22,270
said,
well,

3088
02:26:22,271 --> 02:26:24,970
this is what is so great about,
um,

3089
02:26:25,270 --> 02:26:26,120
about,
you know,

3090
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:31,280
our society is that we have time,
leisure time to dedicate to the things 

3091
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:32,260
that matter to us.
For example,

3092
02:26:32,430 --> 02:26:33,490
you know,
you get a cavity,

3093
02:26:33,491 --> 02:26:35,650
you can replace it with a fake tooth and
look,

3094
02:26:35,740 --> 02:26:37,380
I can eat steak again.
You know,

3095
02:26:37,690 --> 02:26:40,150
as opposed to a,
well you've asked all your teeth,

3096
02:26:40,151 --> 02:26:42,220
now you're stuck eating shrubs for 
whatever it is.

3097
02:26:42,460 --> 02:26:47,460
You know what I mean?
It's worse than chewing gum.

3098
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:50,320
Yeah,
I know what you're saying though.

3099
02:26:50,321 --> 02:26:55,321
I know exactly what you're saying.
It's like I think people they fuck up 

3100
02:26:55,321 --> 02:26:56,960
with this either or thing they fuck up 
this black away too far.

3101
02:26:57,010 --> 02:27:02,010
It's not a black and white issue.
It's like it is complex and we all have 

3102
02:27:02,010 --> 02:27:05,890
unlimited amount of technology that we 
must use to exist in this world today.

3103
02:27:06,220 --> 02:27:11,220
Whether it's close.
If you live in a cold environment that 

3104
02:27:11,220 --> 02:27:11,500
is technology,
whether it's a vehicle,

3105
02:27:11,501 --> 02:27:12,940
a house,
all these things.

3106
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:18,120
We.
These are human creations and human 

3107
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:20,851
innovation.
A fucking house itself is a human 

3108
02:27:20,851 --> 02:27:21,190
creation and if you want to live in a 
house,

3109
02:27:21,220 --> 02:27:23,070
then you want technology.
I mean that.

3110
02:27:23,090 --> 02:27:25,810
That's reality.
Do you not like installation?

3111
02:27:25,811 --> 02:27:28,150
We'll guess what installation was 
created by humans.

3112
02:27:28,510 --> 02:27:30,940
What are you going to use a lighter gets
with that as fuck face.

3113
02:27:31,090 --> 02:27:32,970
That's a technology,
right?

3114
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:35,110
We're going to start all your fire with 
flint.

3115
02:27:35,560 --> 02:27:36,640
Of course,
if you're not,

3116
02:27:36,641 --> 02:27:37,840
you're a hypocrite.
Yeah,

3117
02:27:37,870 --> 02:27:38,520
no,
of course.

3118
02:27:38,550 --> 02:27:41,560
And that's the problem with those 
perspectives.

3119
02:27:41,770 --> 02:27:44,140
And they are taking the either or 
instead of saying,

3120
02:27:44,141 --> 02:27:45,190
well,
what is the middle ground?

3121
02:27:45,191 --> 02:27:46,210
And I think,
you know,

3122
02:27:46,450 --> 02:27:51,450
I guess it's important also that 
transhumanists take a step back and try 

3123
02:27:51,450 --> 02:27:53,920
to work with other groups and say,
well,

3124
02:27:53,980 --> 02:27:56,620
there are times,
and I agreed with a few of his points.

3125
02:27:56,621 --> 02:28:01,621
There are times that technology does 
alienate us or make us forget some of 

3126
02:28:01,621 --> 02:28:02,770
the better parts that we've just talked 
about.

3127
02:28:02,771 --> 02:28:03,150
Like,
well,

3128
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:06,070
what do we really want to live in a 
universe that's totally robotic?

3129
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:08,110
Maybe it's boring.
So there are,

3130
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:13,200
we do need to keep some of the 
ridiculousness as we discussed in our 

3131
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:13,200
lives or some of the,
uh,

3132
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:14,290
the chaos.
But,

3133
02:28:14,291 --> 02:28:15,040
um,
uh,

3134
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:20,120
an advocation should going and just 
advocate going back words to such an 

3135
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:22,340
extreme.
It was such a farfetched

3136
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:24,650
idea.
But,

3137
02:28:24,651 --> 02:28:25,160
um,
you know,

3138
02:28:25,161 --> 02:28:25,730
I,
I think,

3139
02:28:26,030 --> 02:28:28,190
like I said,
it's a big movement and there's a lot of

3140
02:28:28,191 --> 02:28:30,620
people that have gone down that path.
Well,

3141
02:28:30,621 --> 02:28:35,621
there's nothing wrong with it,
for the individual that's involved in 

3142
02:28:35,621 --> 02:28:35,621
that movement.
If you want.

3143
02:28:35,621 --> 02:28:39,251
Look,
there's plenty of area in Alaska if you 

3144
02:28:39,251 --> 02:28:42,221
so choose to go and get some land and 
build a house and live off the land and 

3145
02:28:42,221 --> 02:28:43,760
live a subsistence living.
If that's for you,

3146
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:45,020
you can do that,
man,

3147
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:47,000
you can do that.
You can live like that.

3148
02:28:47,001 --> 02:28:50,510
And there's a bunch of shows dedicated 
to the people that do it.

3149
02:28:50,520 --> 02:28:51,760
Lena,
life below zero,

3150
02:28:51,770 --> 02:28:54,500
one of my favorite ones is fine.
You can do that.

3151
02:28:54,501 --> 02:28:57,560
There's nothing wrong with that.
But to think that society has to do that

3152
02:28:57,561 --> 02:28:58,460
too,
man,

3153
02:28:58,461 --> 02:29:03,461
you're digging your heels in on a 
process that is impossible to slow down 

3154
02:29:03,730 --> 02:29:04,670
the train left long time.

3155
02:29:04,670 --> 02:29:06,110
There's no changing this.
I mean,

3156
02:29:06,130 --> 02:29:07,790
we,
this is what we're about now.

3157
02:29:07,820 --> 02:29:10,100
It's what we've been about since they 
invented metal.

3158
02:29:10,460 --> 02:29:11,180
You know,
it's,

3159
02:29:11,181 --> 02:29:13,910
it's been a slow process that combustion
engine,

3160
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:15,140
tires,
roads,

3161
02:29:15,350 --> 02:29:19,520
all of it is almost an unstoppable 
process.

3162
02:29:20,060 --> 02:29:25,060
Three d printing is fascinating to me 
and that was one of the things I wanted 

3163
02:29:25,060 --> 02:29:28,541
to bring up when it came to Africa,
when you were talking about the ability 

3164
02:29:28,541 --> 02:29:32,051
to use cell phones to get medicine.
I'm fascinated by the ability to 

3165
02:29:32,051 --> 02:29:36,071
actually produce things that produce 
things in like things that are necessary

3166
02:29:36,471 --> 02:29:41,360
for survival in these villages.
The the ability to instead of have goods

3167
02:29:41,361 --> 02:29:46,361
shipped in to produce them and 
ultimately maybe even possibly produce 

3168
02:29:46,361 --> 02:29:50,831
medicine if technology continues to 
improve to produce whatever nano bots 

3169
02:29:51,381 --> 02:29:56,381
that we're going to be able to inject 
into our bodies to have a machine that 

3170
02:29:56,381 --> 02:30:00,731
makes those things so that you can 
literally fix people on the spot in any 

3171
02:30:00,891 --> 02:30:04,160
remote location with these types of 
technologies.

3172
02:30:04,670 --> 02:30:06,620
I mean,
I think that's something that we have to

3173
02:30:06,621 --> 02:30:07,440
look forward to.
You know,

3174
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:12,670
if eventually you can have something 
that fits in a backpack that you can 

3175
02:30:12,670 --> 02:30:17,081
take anywhere in the world that 
controlled by some type of wireless 

3176
02:30:17,081 --> 02:30:17,960
signals and you could promote your like,
you know what?

3177
02:30:17,961 --> 02:30:22,961
I need something for this person because
they broke their leg and make it right 

3178
02:30:22,961 --> 02:30:23,030
there on the spot.
I mean,

3179
02:30:23,031 --> 02:30:28,031
imagine what it would do for huge swaths
of the population that are actually 

3180
02:30:28,031 --> 02:30:32,830
don't have access to that type of.
I mean you could create the malaria 

3181
02:30:32,830 --> 02:30:33,320
medicine right on there.
So I mean it,

3182
02:30:33,430 --> 02:30:35,390
it absolutely stands to change the 
world.

3183
02:30:35,391 --> 02:30:40,391
And I think three d printing is probably
one of the most exciting things that 

3184
02:30:40,391 --> 02:30:41,920
have happened in this decade so far.
You know,

3185
02:30:41,921 --> 02:30:44,690
as far as things in the press and things
that we're looking forward to.

3186
02:30:44,990 --> 02:30:49,990
And I think it has the possibility of,
of totally transforming manufacturing 

3187
02:30:50,151 --> 02:30:52,790
itself.
There might come a time when everyone in

3188
02:30:52,791 --> 02:30:55,640
their house has one and anything that 
you need,

3189
02:30:55,641 --> 02:30:58,430
whether it's a lava lamp or a,
you know,

3190
02:30:58,431 --> 02:31:00,020
a,
a table or A.

3191
02:31:00,050 --> 02:31:05,050
I mean you'll be able to create parts of
it or create it and put it together and 

3192
02:31:05,050 --> 02:31:05,930
everything will come with plans,
you know,

3193
02:31:05,931 --> 02:31:08,500
and we can do now with printers,
with,

3194
02:31:08,730 --> 02:31:13,730
with photograph printers.
They can print these beautiful high 

3195
02:31:13,730 --> 02:31:14,390
resolution photographs from a cell 
phone.

3196
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:19,630
He take your cell phone,
I don't know how many megapixels these 

3197
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:19,980
things have now,
but this new iphone,

3198
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:23,400
the Lens in the camera on them,
it's beautiful.

3199
02:31:23,550 --> 02:31:28,550
So you take these incredibly rich 
pictures and then you print them and 

3200
02:31:28,550 --> 02:31:32,780
there's large foot and put it on a frame
and you would never know if you looked 

3201
02:31:32,780 --> 02:31:36,531
at that frame photo that,
that came off of a regular computer 

3202
02:31:36,531 --> 02:31:36,531
printer from a cell phone.

3203
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:41,540
I mean,
it's amazing and this is something that 

3204
02:31:41,540 --> 02:31:41,540
didn't exist 10,
15,

3205
02:31:41,540 --> 02:31:45,741
20 years ago.
It's just the technology wasn't 

3206
02:31:45,741 --> 02:31:45,741
available 20 years ago.
Ten years ago.

3207
02:31:45,741 --> 02:31:46,830
They looked like shit.
Today.

3208
02:31:46,831 --> 02:31:48,930
They look amazing.
Totally.

3209
02:31:48,931 --> 02:31:53,931
And you know,
in the future you're going to probably 

3210
02:31:53,931 --> 02:31:56,090
print them in your frame and put them 
right there on your desk and you're 

3211
02:31:56,090 --> 02:31:56,090
done.
You know what I mean?

3212
02:31:56,090 --> 02:31:57,180
It's,
it's going to be a hologram.

3213
02:31:57,310 --> 02:31:58,260
Yeah,
you're right.

3214
02:31:58,300 --> 02:31:58,970
Future,
you know,

3215
02:31:59,010 --> 02:32:01,950
it's going to already be that.
Which is a crazy.

3216
02:32:02,310 --> 02:32:04,320
Have you seen this new technology that 
they're using?

3217
02:32:04,321 --> 02:32:09,321
What was that shit called?
The with the little elephant and the 

3218
02:32:09,321 --> 02:32:11,190
guy's hand that was with um,
uh,

3219
02:32:11,430 --> 02:32:16,430
the,
the one we did with Lewis from unbox 

3220
02:32:16,430 --> 02:32:16,430
therapy.
I'll find it,

3221
02:32:16,430 --> 02:32:21,220
find it.
I don't know if you even know about 

3222
02:32:21,220 --> 02:32:21,220
this,
but there's some incredible.

3223
02:32:21,220 --> 02:32:24,771
Is that Google that's working on that,
some insane new technology that allows 

3224
02:32:24,990 --> 02:32:29,970
them to project three d images that are 
moving with shadows on your hand.

3225
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:32,910
Like what?
We would have star wars.

3226
02:32:33,150 --> 02:32:34,230
You know,
you haven't seen this.

3227
02:32:34,231 --> 02:32:35,130
No,
I don't think so.

3228
02:32:35,160 --> 02:32:39,060
How dare you magically magically put 
this up,

3229
02:32:39,061 --> 02:32:40,830
put this up so he can get a look at 
this.

3230
02:32:41,100 --> 02:32:44,010
But there's a,
there's a website that shows some of the

3231
02:32:44,011 --> 02:32:49,011
demos of what's going to be capable,
what's going to be possible with this 

3232
02:32:49,011 --> 02:32:49,530
technology,
but it's unbelievable.

3233
02:32:49,680 --> 02:32:54,680
There's a,
there's one that really gets me because 

3234
02:32:54,680 --> 02:32:56,460
I have daughters and there's a tiny 
ballerina dancing on this girl's bed.

3235
02:32:56,940 --> 02:32:58,350
I mean,
look at this.

3236
02:32:58,680 --> 02:33:00,210
Oh Wow.
That's brilliant.

3237
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:01,590
Yeah.
There's,

3238
02:33:01,591 --> 02:33:06,591
this guy has this for folks listening to
this magic leap l e a p is the name of 

3239
02:33:06,661 --> 02:33:07,980
this technology.
You can google it.

3240
02:33:08,220 --> 02:33:13,220
This guy has his hands open and there's 
a small elephant floating and dancing in

3241
02:33:13,261 --> 02:33:18,261
his hands and they're going to be able 
to project things that aren't really.

3242
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:23,100
They're out in the world and,
and have,

3243
02:33:23,140 --> 02:33:25,080
you know,
floating dragons.

3244
02:33:25,410 --> 02:33:27,080
I mean,
they're going to be like,

3245
02:33:27,090 --> 02:33:32,090
there's a picture here.
We're looking at of these kids looking 

3246
02:33:32,090 --> 02:33:35,151
at these beautiful sea horses that are 
floating above their desk in their 

3247
02:33:35,151 --> 02:33:35,550
classroom.
This one gets me,

3248
02:33:35,730 --> 02:33:39,060
this little girl watching a ballerina 
dance on her bed.

3249
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:42,600
I don't know what the projection 
mechanism is,

3250
02:33:42,601 --> 02:33:45,260
what the technologies involved in like,
what you know,

3251
02:33:45,310 --> 02:33:47,370
is it,
where does it come from?

3252
02:33:47,430 --> 02:33:49,020
I'm not sure,
but God,

3253
02:33:49,021 --> 02:33:51,480
it looks insane.
It's literally incredible that.

3254
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:56,600
I mean,
imagine all the billboards that are all 

3255
02:33:56,600 --> 02:33:56,600
going to be taken down.
You're just going to project stuff,

3256
02:33:56,700 --> 02:33:58,710
but that's just cause car crashes 
everywhere.

3257
02:33:59,300 --> 02:34:01,110
You know?
It's not a real elephant.

3258
02:34:01,111 --> 02:34:06,111
No,
it's an elephant fucking magic leap 

3259
02:34:06,111 --> 02:34:06,111
shit.
I mean,

3260
02:34:06,111 --> 02:34:09,831
there's a whole host of problems.
It will change the entire world of 

3261
02:34:09,831 --> 02:34:09,831
advertising.

3262
02:34:09,831 --> 02:34:12,000
It's just like know the whole thing 
because you'll just be like,

3263
02:34:12,460 --> 02:34:14,070
but.
And then it'll change the entire thing.

3264
02:34:14,071 --> 02:34:15,150
That's.
I haven't seen that yet.

3265
02:34:15,151 --> 02:34:16,470
I'm surprised.
When did that come out?

3266
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:19,180
It's pretty recent this month.
Okay.

3267
02:34:19,390 --> 02:34:21,600
How dare you not be on the cutting edge,
new,

3268
02:34:21,610 --> 02:34:26,610
the transhumanism guy working too hard,
I think you to get on the twitter with 

3269
02:34:26,610 --> 02:34:27,600
the young kids today.
Well,

3270
02:34:27,601 --> 02:34:29,380
we didn't find out about the Lewis came 
on it,

3271
02:34:29,510 --> 02:34:31,460
explain it to us,
but it's um,

3272
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:34,470
it's mindblowing and this is obviously,
look,

3273
02:34:34,480 --> 02:34:39,000
you're pretty in tune with this stuff 
and you weren't aware of this and I mean

3274
02:34:39,010 --> 02:34:42,760
how many other technologies are on the 
verge of announcing that these guys have

3275
02:34:42,761 --> 02:34:47,761
been working on for years and you know,
these folks are about to put out and 

3276
02:34:47,761 --> 02:34:48,220
just we're not,
we're not aware of yet.

3277
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:49,900
When that came out I was like,
oh,

3278
02:34:49,901 --> 02:34:52,000
this is one of those leaps that I never 
saw coming.

3279
02:34:52,440 --> 02:34:54,100
You know,
you're looking at that guy's hands.

3280
02:34:54,130 --> 02:34:59,130
If that's real,
if that's a working model that's not a 

3281
02:34:59,130 --> 02:34:59,590
CGI representation of what they're 
actually going to be able to do.

3282
02:34:59,900 --> 02:35:02,170
That's mindblowing stuff.
Totally.

3283
02:35:02,171 --> 02:35:07,171
Totally.
I hope it's not like the hover board 

3284
02:35:07,171 --> 02:35:09,631
thing where they were,
they did you see the hoverboard 

3285
02:35:09,631 --> 02:35:09,631
commercial that came in and it was like,
it was like,

3286
02:35:09,631 --> 02:35:11,410
oh,
but then it ended up not being real,

3287
02:35:11,411 --> 02:35:16,411
but then I think in the last few months 
they actually did do one that was sorta 

3288
02:35:16,411 --> 02:35:16,411
real or sort of.
Yeah,

3289
02:35:16,411 --> 02:35:20,500
but I'm a surfer and a skateboarder,
so I look forward to that kind of thing.

3290
02:35:20,501 --> 02:35:22,180
It just sounds like it's something I 
dreamt of,

3291
02:35:22,181 --> 02:35:24,100
you know,
when I was a young kid.

3292
02:35:24,370 --> 02:35:29,370
I think it's going to be like a 
combination of like that hoverboard 

3293
02:35:29,370 --> 02:35:30,580
technology along with those scooters.
What are those things called?

3294
02:35:30,581 --> 02:35:31,790
Those gyroscope scooters.

3295
02:35:31,990 --> 02:35:34,800
Now I'm talking about what are those 
guys segues.

3296
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:35,740
Yeah,
those segways.

3297
02:35:35,860 --> 02:35:37,840
Have you ever written a segway know?
Amazing,

3298
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:38,870
amazing,
cool.

3299
02:35:39,490 --> 02:35:44,490
Kevin James,
a good buddy of mine and he was doing 

3300
02:35:44,490 --> 02:35:45,010
that move the Paul Blart mall cop and 
you know,

3301
02:35:45,011 --> 02:35:48,860
in that movie he's riding around in this
silly segue and uh,

3302
02:35:48,970 --> 02:35:50,770
he got one because of he's like,
dude,

3303
02:35:50,771 --> 02:35:52,120
they are amazing.
And I was like,

3304
02:35:52,121 --> 02:35:53,430
yeah,
you're riding a scooter.

3305
02:35:53,431 --> 02:35:55,660
Is that really fun?
But I rode one.

3306
02:35:55,661 --> 02:35:57,010
I'm like,
this is incredible.

3307
02:35:57,100 --> 02:36:01,090
You lean forward to make it go and you 
lean back to make it stop.

3308
02:36:01,091 --> 02:36:04,190
You turned like you shift your weight to
turn with it.

3309
02:36:04,330 --> 02:36:06,450
If they're amazing,
really amazing.

3310
02:36:06,580 --> 02:36:11,580
I know that they haven't.
Like you can just rent them for a 

3311
02:36:11,580 --> 02:36:11,580
vacation vacation.
They're really fun,

3312
02:36:11,580 --> 02:36:11,580
man.
They're really.

3313
02:36:11,580 --> 02:36:12,790
The problem is when they run out of 
batteries,

3314
02:36:12,791 --> 02:36:15,760
you're fucked because George Bush was on
one,

3315
02:36:15,761 --> 02:36:20,761
it went out of batteries and went flying
over the top of it because it's just 

3316
02:36:20,761 --> 02:36:21,730
stops and it just falls down.

3317
02:36:22,030 --> 02:36:27,030
So like when the battery's out,
like you fucking tilt forward and fall 

3318
02:36:27,030 --> 02:36:30,781
flat on your face because the gyroscope 
is somehow or another balancing your 

3319
02:36:30,781 --> 02:36:32,650
weighed out,
like as you're moving with this thing,

3320
02:36:32,890 --> 02:36:37,890
it's sort of correcting,
like going back and forth with you and 

3321
02:36:37,890 --> 02:36:40,210
when it runs out of batteries long,
how long do they go?

3322
02:36:40,220 --> 02:36:41,760
Just good question.
I don't know,

3323
02:36:42,310 --> 02:36:44,740
how long can those teslas go when they,
they,

3324
02:36:44,741 --> 02:36:46,300
uh,
even those things.

3325
02:36:46,301 --> 02:36:48,760
I mean those are amazing,
but they're only good for like 300 miles

3326
02:36:49,090 --> 02:36:50,500
on the highway.
Right?

3327
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:51,730
Right.
Yeah.

3328
02:36:52,640 --> 02:36:53,510
The,
the,

3329
02:36:53,590 --> 02:36:56,790
the electric car thing is going to be,
I mean they're going to,

3330
02:36:56,950 --> 02:37:01,950
don't they?
They accelerate far quicker than the 

3331
02:37:01,950 --> 02:37:05,350
horsepower engine.
Not Quicker but comparable.

3332
02:37:05,470 --> 02:37:07,720
Like we were talking about horsepower 
wars,

3333
02:37:07,980 --> 02:37:11,470
like these new teslas,
the Tesla Model D,

3334
02:37:11,650 --> 02:37:15,070
I believe it's comparable to like a 
really high end,

3335
02:37:15,440 --> 02:37:15,980
like a

3336
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:19,100
sports car right now.
Like I think they're doing zero to 60 in

3337
02:37:19,130 --> 02:37:24,130
under four seconds.
They that ability with an electric car 

3338
02:37:24,130 --> 02:37:27,941
and especially because I think they have
four wheel drives is not as much 

3339
02:37:27,941 --> 02:37:29,690
traction issues as they have with some 
two wheel drive cars.

3340
02:37:30,940 --> 02:37:32,110
They're getting there,
you know,

3341
02:37:32,230 --> 02:37:37,230
and it's also,
they don't have gears the way like you 

3342
02:37:37,230 --> 02:37:37,230
have to go first,
gear second gear third,

3343
02:37:37,230 --> 02:37:41,381
they just go,
you know because it doesn't have a 

3344
02:37:41,381 --> 02:37:43,541
combustion engine,
doesn't have to sort of regulate the 

3345
02:37:43,541 --> 02:37:45,881
power through a transmission the same 
way as a completely different kind of 

3346
02:37:45,881 --> 02:37:46,260
transmission.
So it's all,

3347
02:37:46,270 --> 02:37:51,270
it's all pretty amazing stuff.
I used to race motorcycles growing up 

3348
02:37:51,270 --> 02:37:54,450
and I've been following a little bit of 
the electric motorcycle market too,

3349
02:37:54,451 --> 02:37:56,570
which just slowly developing.
I didn't even know about that,

3350
02:37:56,630 --> 02:38:01,630
but it's not nearly as complex and I 
don't know if anyone's making any money 

3351
02:38:01,630 --> 02:38:05,411
yet,
but they're of course trying to do the 

3352
02:38:05,411 --> 02:38:07,631
same types of things and they're trying 
to do the same types of things with all 

3353
02:38:07,631 --> 02:38:10,901
sorts of vehicles now including 
watercraft vehicles and boats and stuff 

3354
02:38:10,901 --> 02:38:10,901
like that.

3355
02:38:10,901 --> 02:38:14,030
And so the entire market it could 
literally change.

3356
02:38:14,330 --> 02:38:19,330
And you know,
one of the technologies I love most is 

3357
02:38:19,330 --> 02:38:21,641
the exoskeleton technology because I 
have a feeling that within five years 

3358
02:38:22,730 --> 02:38:25,310
now,
I think Panasonic is releasing its first

3359
02:38:25,490 --> 02:38:28,760
exoskeleton commercially in the next few
months,

3360
02:38:28,980 --> 02:38:31,580
at least according to some articles I 
did.

3361
02:38:31,880 --> 02:38:33,420
Um,
and uh,

3362
02:38:34,220 --> 02:38:39,220
it's post costs around $5,000.
I don't know how many are going to be 

3363
02:38:39,220 --> 02:38:42,041
available.
I'm not sure if it's even on schedule 

3364
02:38:42,041 --> 02:38:44,021
right now,
but it was a few months ago and 

3365
02:38:44,021 --> 02:38:46,840
apparently going to be able to walk a 
little bit on and lift some very heavy 

3366
02:38:46,840 --> 02:38:49,871
stuff.
But I'm assuming within five years 

3367
02:38:49,871 --> 02:38:50,840
you'll be able to run and play sports 
and think of some of the activity.

3368
02:38:50,930 --> 02:38:55,930
First off,
it's going to change the way a lot of 

3369
02:38:55,930 --> 02:38:58,420
old unfit,
obese people handle their existence 

3370
02:38:58,420 --> 02:39:00,110
because either a,
I,

3371
02:39:00,290 --> 02:39:01,240
I'm,
you know,

3372
02:39:02,210 --> 02:39:03,720
a lot of them can't go outside right 
now,

3373
02:39:03,721 --> 02:39:08,721
are a lot of them can't get to the goal 
from the bathroom to the frigerator 

3374
02:39:08,721 --> 02:39:08,721
comfortably.

3375
02:39:08,721 --> 02:39:12,850
If you're wearing one of these things,
it's going to be a lot easier for a lot 

3376
02:39:12,850 --> 02:39:16,331
of unfit people to move so that could 
revolutionize American specialist since 

3377
02:39:16,331 --> 02:39:17,510
we have so much obesity and diabetes and
stuff like that.

3378
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:21,140
But I'm pretty sure in five years you're
going to see a lot more sporting events.

3379
02:39:21,350 --> 02:39:26,350
Uh,
like things like people running with it 

3380
02:39:26,350 --> 02:39:26,350
and that'll,
you know,

3381
02:39:26,350 --> 02:39:29,801
you just look outside.
People will be jogging and their 

3382
02:39:29,801 --> 02:39:31,631
exoskeleton suits and they're probably 
going to be very soon able to jog as 

3383
02:39:31,631 --> 02:39:35,411
quickly as maybe horses or even as one 
day they'll probably be able to outrun 

3384
02:39:35,411 --> 02:39:36,620
cheetahs.
It's really just a matter of,

3385
02:39:36,790 --> 02:39:38,210
of technology,
you know,

3386
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:39,340
fuck,
10,

3387
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:42,380
55,
60 miles an hour or something,

3388
02:39:42,740 --> 02:39:45,050
something crazy that might be 20 years 
out.

3389
02:39:45,230 --> 02:39:50,230
But the thing is the x.
The great thing about the exoskeleton 

3390
02:39:50,230 --> 02:39:52,610
technology is that it offers the ability
for a lot of people to use it.

3391
02:39:52,610 --> 02:39:57,610
So you know,
some technologies like only 10 percent 

3392
02:39:57,610 --> 02:39:59,570
of the population would actually use it,
but exoskeleton technology is uh,

3393
02:39:59,580 --> 02:40:01,390
uh,
will get a huge amount,

3394
02:40:01,400 --> 02:40:02,770
will become probably a,
you know,

3395
02:40:02,790 --> 02:40:05,080
a multibillion dollar industry very 
quickly.

3396
02:40:05,090 --> 02:40:07,100
It already is.
I think I wore one of the cruder,

3397
02:40:07,101 --> 02:40:09,200
one's not,
I shouldn't say cruder,

3398
02:40:09,201 --> 02:40:13,280
but it's fairly prototypical model.
And uh,

3399
02:40:13,290 --> 02:40:17,520
there was a show that I did for Scifi 
called Joe Rogan questions everything.

3400
02:40:17,521 --> 02:40:22,521
And one of them we went to this place 
and I put the suit on and it kind of 

3401
02:40:22,521 --> 02:40:26,700
walks with you,
it like Kinda like makes your legs walk.

3402
02:40:26,701 --> 02:40:31,701
And for people,
we had a guy who was paralyzed from the 

3403
02:40:31,701 --> 02:40:32,160
waist down and he used this and you 
could walk around with it,

3404
02:40:32,430 --> 02:40:36,390
but it's attached.
But a tether to this power pack and it's

3405
02:40:36,391 --> 02:40:39,640
very large and no,
they're totally bald still.

3406
02:40:39,800 --> 02:40:42,480
Yeah.
But it's going to be smaller and smaller

3407
02:40:42,481 --> 02:40:44,790
and the power supply is going to be 
smaller and smaller.

3408
02:40:44,791 --> 02:40:47,640
And as battery technology continues to 
evolve,

3409
02:40:47,641 --> 02:40:52,641
that's when things are going to get 
stranger and stranger and Harvard right 

3410
02:40:52,641 --> 02:40:55,941
now is working on a soft one,
like a soft excos exoskeleton suit and 

3411
02:40:55,941 --> 02:41:00,921
they're,
one of the reasons we're working on is 

3412
02:41:00,921 --> 02:41:02,601
for military people that are carrying 
these really heavy backpacks and it's 

3413
02:41:02,601 --> 02:41:04,980
not supposed to be something sort of 
like the steel one where it helps you to

3414
02:41:04,981 --> 02:41:05,490
walk.
It's,

3415
02:41:05,630 --> 02:41:08,520
it helps you to walk,
but it's not supposed to be like you can

3416
02:41:08,521 --> 02:41:13,521
lift stuff with it.
It's just supposed to help you go much 

3417
02:41:13,521 --> 02:41:15,690
further distances without getting tired.
So it's like adding 20,

3418
02:41:15,700 --> 02:41:19,500
30 percent of your walking capacity to 
you and you know,

3419
02:41:19,620 --> 02:41:21,820
I've seen already the test on them and 
Harvard and uh,

3420
02:41:22,010 --> 02:41:22,980
it's,
it's pretty brilliant.

3421
02:41:23,130 --> 02:41:28,130
Brilliant.
Have you heard about this armor that 

3422
02:41:28,130 --> 02:41:29,220
Harvard that hardens on impact?
The Harvard exoskeleton.

3423
02:41:29,460 --> 02:41:30,500
Oh Wow.
What do,

3424
02:41:30,520 --> 02:41:33,010
what do we see in here?
Walking in it.

3425
02:41:33,090 --> 02:41:34,010
Yeah.
This is the soft.

3426
02:41:34,650 --> 02:41:36,930
That's incredible.
This is the one I think that will really

3427
02:41:36,931 --> 02:41:41,931
catch on because people are going to be 
a little bit afraid of the metal thing 

3428
02:41:41,931 --> 02:41:42,270
to get into.
But this is one that I think,

3429
02:41:42,660 --> 02:41:44,130
you know,
a lot of people say,

3430
02:41:44,131 --> 02:41:45,120
hey,
it's just like a drug.

3431
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:46,800
It's an outfit.
That jogging outfit.

3432
02:41:46,980 --> 02:41:48,450
Yeah.
Wow.

3433
02:41:48,630 --> 02:41:50,810
And some of the tests that they're doing
with this stuff is.

3434
02:41:50,840 --> 02:41:55,840
So this makes you stronger and it can 
make you faster and you got a little 

3435
02:41:55,861 --> 02:41:58,260
fanny pack back there with some 
batteries on it.

3436
02:41:58,790 --> 02:42:03,790
Yeah.
That the battery packs are gonna get 

3437
02:42:03,790 --> 02:42:05,481
smaller and smaller.
And that's so interesting is these 

3438
02:42:05,481 --> 02:42:08,091
people are working on this technology 
that people that are working on battery 

3439
02:42:08,091 --> 02:42:12,051
technology will develop smaller and 
smaller batteries and it'll get to a 

3440
02:42:12,051 --> 02:42:16,521
point where they all work together and 
just create these things that we just 

3441
02:42:16,521 --> 02:42:16,770
can't even wrap our hands around right 
now.

3442
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:22,700
Yeah.
Well I mean I look for it because I've 

3443
02:42:22,700 --> 02:42:24,681
been a motorcycle rider most of my life.
I think the exoskeleton business is very

3444
02:42:25,261 --> 02:42:30,261
similar to,
to kind of like what more cycle writing 

3445
02:42:30,261 --> 02:42:30,261
is.
To me it's recreational.

3446
02:42:30,270 --> 02:42:35,270
So if you could put on an exoskeleton 
suit and go play different types of 

3447
02:42:35,270 --> 02:42:36,660
sports or go climbing or,
and stuff like that,

3448
02:42:36,870 --> 02:42:41,870
you might find yourself able to do 
things that you never would have done 

3449
02:42:41,870 --> 02:42:41,870
before,
um,

3450
02:42:41,870 --> 02:42:44,750
and uh,
and have strength more strength and more

3451
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:48,240
endurance and stuff like that.
So I think an entire recreational,

3452
02:42:48,330 --> 02:42:49,410
like,
you know,

3453
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:54,840
um,
enterprise is going to occur because of 

3454
02:42:54,840 --> 02:42:57,681
it where people start using exoskeleton 
technology in the same way that they 

3455
02:42:57,681 --> 02:43:01,341
would use recreational motorcycles or 
recreational boats where we now go do 

3456
02:43:01,341 --> 02:43:05,080
exoskeleton things together.
We climbed mountains,

3457
02:43:05,480 --> 02:43:10,480
climbed cliffs,
we never would've been able to climb 

3458
02:43:10,480 --> 02:43:10,480
just because we can lift ourselves 
instead.

3459
02:43:10,480 --> 02:43:11,710
And we have grip that we never would 
have had.

3460
02:43:11,711 --> 02:43:13,510
Let's play catch with a boulder.
Yeah,

3461
02:43:13,511 --> 02:43:14,250
exactly.
You know,

3462
02:43:14,251 --> 02:43:15,940
that's crazy.
Stuff like that.

3463
02:43:15,941 --> 02:43:17,230
No,
but I mean it's pretty.

3464
02:43:17,410 --> 02:43:20,650
It could change.
I think a lot of recreational things and

3465
02:43:20,651 --> 02:43:22,030
I'm,
you know,

3466
02:43:22,140 --> 02:43:24,790
I think it's also,
like I said,

3467
02:43:24,791 --> 02:43:29,791
it's going to be so much money to be 
made in that the technology is going to 

3468
02:43:29,791 --> 02:43:31,090
grow a lot quicker than perhaps other 
fields.

3469
02:43:31,450 --> 02:43:33,220
So I'm totally excited about it because,
uh,

3470
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:35,590
as I told my wife,
I ruined one of my articles.

3471
02:43:35,591 --> 02:43:37,780
I want one for Christmas.
I want the first one coming out.

3472
02:43:37,781 --> 02:43:38,950
They're pretty expensive,
so I'm not.

3473
02:43:39,070 --> 02:43:41,190
Have you heard of this artificial skin?

3474
02:43:41,280 --> 02:43:46,280
They've developed?
It's bulletproof that's made out of 

3475
02:43:46,280 --> 02:43:46,280
spider silk.
It's,

3476
02:43:46,280 --> 02:43:50,300
it's a,
it's an artificial skin that they 

3477
02:43:50,300 --> 02:43:50,400
believe they're going to be able to put 
on human beings.

3478
02:43:50,401 --> 02:43:51,990
It's gonna.
Make people bulletproof.

3479
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:54,690
You know,
I've heard of the artificial skin.

3480
02:43:54,691 --> 02:43:56,500
I haven't heard of the bulletproof 
article.

3481
02:43:56,610 --> 02:43:59,910
Discovery Dot Com.
If you want to see if you want to google

3482
02:43:59,911 --> 02:44:04,911
it.
For the folks who are listening to your 

3483
02:44:04,911 --> 02:44:06,350
bulletproof skin made from spider silk.
This is so crazy.

3484
02:44:07,140 --> 02:44:10,110
Spiders are coming to the aid of burn 
victims.

3485
02:44:10,500 --> 02:44:15,240
This is one of the things that they've 
figured out a way to use spider silk and

3486
02:44:15,241 --> 02:44:18,660
combine it and some sort of a way to 
create artificial skin.

3487
02:44:19,320 --> 02:44:24,320
And so this Dutch artist,
along with forensic genomicists genomics

3488
02:44:26,610 --> 02:44:30,540
genomics consortium in the Netherlands,
created a Swatch,

3489
02:44:31,050 --> 02:44:32,750
a swatch right,
as I said,

3490
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:37,920
of nearly bulletproof skin,
made from spider silk and human skin 

3491
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:42,021
cells.
That project takes its name from the 

3492
02:44:42,021 --> 02:44:44,511
maximum weight and velocity.
A type one bulletproof vest can 

3493
02:44:44,521 --> 02:44:47,640
withstand from a 22 caliber long rifle 
bullet.

3494
02:44:48,150 --> 02:44:50,410
So this is the image that you're looking
at it as.

3495
02:44:50,430 --> 02:44:55,430
That's a bullet that's headed towards 
this piece of artificial skin that 

3496
02:44:55,430 --> 02:44:59,271
they've created.
And the idea is as this technology 

3497
02:44:59,271 --> 02:45:02,031
grows,
you're eventually going to be able to 

3498
02:45:02,031 --> 02:45:05,091
replace human skin with artificial skin 
that's bulletproof.

3499
02:45:07,560 --> 02:45:08,100
What's.

3500
02:45:08,620 --> 02:45:09,480
Oh,
that's awesome.

3501
02:45:09,481 --> 02:45:10,890
That's another like,
wow,

3502
02:45:10,891 --> 02:45:12,600
look,
now nothing happened to me.

3503
02:45:12,660 --> 02:45:13,740
Yeah,
you car accident.

3504
02:45:13,741 --> 02:45:15,160
I didn't even get scratched.
Yeah,

3505
02:45:15,161 --> 02:45:15,410
I'll be

3506
02:45:15,430 --> 02:45:16,690
fine.
I mean,

3507
02:45:16,691 --> 02:45:21,691
and it's,
it's gonna come a point in time where 

3508
02:45:21,691 --> 02:45:24,400
we're going to see people removing their
parts and changing,

3509
02:45:24,430 --> 02:45:26,680
exchanging them.
They could see the impact of this.

3510
02:45:26,950 --> 02:45:28,360
Watch the show.
This again,

3511
02:45:28,361 --> 02:45:33,361
Jamie,
you could see the impact of this is so 

3512
02:45:33,361 --> 02:45:35,971
crazy.
This is on new scientists have this 

3513
02:45:35,971 --> 02:45:36,370
bullet hitting this spider silk skin.
And looked,

3514
02:45:36,430 --> 02:45:39,490
it just bounces it out.
I mean you see the impact of the bullet,

3515
02:45:39,910 --> 02:45:43,210
but it,
it doesn't break the skin,

3516
02:45:43,211 --> 02:45:48,211
which is just fucking insane.
I mean it's an artificial skin that 

3517
02:45:49,091 --> 02:45:52,450
you're going to be able to replace your 
skin with some day.

3518
02:45:52,980 --> 02:45:53,440
I,
I,

3519
02:45:54,130 --> 02:45:56,230
I can't.
I can't imagine.

3520
02:45:56,560 --> 02:46:01,560
I mean,
I literally can't imagine mean it's 

3521
02:46:01,560 --> 02:46:01,560
hitting it.
You're going,

3522
02:46:01,560 --> 02:46:02,230
you're still going to have to deal with 
the impact of the bullet.

3523
02:46:03,160 --> 02:46:05,020
When there was other stuff that I was 
talking about,

3524
02:46:05,050 --> 02:46:10,050
this armor that they've created for 
motorcycle riders that hardens on 

3525
02:46:10,050 --> 02:46:10,050
impact,

3526
02:46:10,080 --> 02:46:14,270
that you can mush it in your hand.
It's pliable until it receives an impact

3527
02:46:14,390 --> 02:46:19,390
and they do a demo with it where they 
have a hammer and they're playing with 

3528
02:46:19,390 --> 02:46:23,111
it and towing it and pushing it.
And then he hits it with a hammer and 

3529
02:46:23,111 --> 02:46:24,350
it's hard as a rock.
So you could have this armor on,

3530
02:46:24,500 --> 02:46:26,930
fall off your motorcycle and it protects
you.

3531
02:46:27,140 --> 02:46:32,140
Like as if you're covered in an 
incredibly hard like polymers shell or 

3532
02:46:32,140 --> 02:46:33,250
something like that.
Sounds similar that you know,

3533
02:46:33,290 --> 02:46:36,500
they now have the bicycle helmets that 
inflate when you fall,

3534
02:46:36,501 --> 02:46:40,190
it knows that through a balance and that
you can like if you're going to fall and

3535
02:46:40,191 --> 02:46:43,970
there's going to be an impact,
it inflates like very instantaneous,

3536
02:46:43,971 --> 02:46:48,971
sort of like an airbag so you can,
you wear it around your collar and it's 

3537
02:46:48,971 --> 02:46:49,270
just like something right here in 
school.

3538
02:46:49,810 --> 02:46:52,220
Oh,
so it protects your neck and I felt like

3539
02:46:52,730 --> 02:46:57,730
one of my articles,
I mentioned it because I thought with 

3540
02:46:57,730 --> 02:46:58,820
aerial skiing where they're doing like 
four or five jumps,

3541
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,220
if you know you're going to blow it,
it could just,

3542
02:47:01,480 --> 02:47:06,480
you know,
right at the last moment a full body 

3543
02:47:06,480 --> 02:47:09,221
thing.
It's this kind of technology that kind 

3544
02:47:09,221 --> 02:47:09,740
of like blow up stuff could protect us 
from a lot of things.

3545
02:47:09,741 --> 02:47:14,741
You know,
in the future I suppose we could wear 

3546
02:47:14,741 --> 02:47:14,741
suits that protect us from our own 
idiocy.

3547
02:47:14,741 --> 02:47:14,741
Yeah.
Well,

3548
02:47:14,741 --> 02:47:19,661
I mean what if the entire know,
I don't know if it would work for 

3549
02:47:19,661 --> 02:47:22,121
something like airplanes or something,
but eventually we want to get to that 

3550
02:47:22,121 --> 02:47:22,400
point when we are invincible.
Really,

3551
02:47:22,401 --> 02:47:26,970
nothing we can do can harm us and that 
that's going to be great.

3552
02:47:27,020 --> 02:47:32,020
I'm,
that's why I said that's the stuff 

3553
02:47:32,020 --> 02:47:32,020
jamie,
you're showing on the screen.

3554
02:47:32,020 --> 02:47:32,020
This is this,
uh,

3555
02:47:32,020 --> 02:47:34,040
this is this impact stuffs a cc the 
skies,

3556
02:47:34,041 --> 02:47:39,041
moving it around,
but now watch when he hits it with his 

3557
02:47:39,041 --> 02:47:39,860
hammer.
Nothing.

3558
02:47:40,370 --> 02:47:41,330
Wow.
Just stop.

3559
02:47:41,420 --> 02:47:42,740
It's just showing how pliable it is.

3560
02:47:44,150 --> 02:47:46,190
Yeah.
I don't think that's the same stuff.

3561
02:47:46,670 --> 02:47:48,920
I don't know if the same one,
the one that I saw when he hits it,

3562
02:47:48,921 --> 02:47:50,420
it's hard as a rock.
Okay.

3563
02:47:50,640 --> 02:47:53,060
But I mean it might be just a different 
kind of impact.

3564
02:47:53,080 --> 02:47:57,260
Resistant like it gave in a little bit.
The stuff that I saw,

3565
02:47:57,261 --> 02:47:59,210
he hit it with a hammer and just like 
dunk,

3566
02:47:59,380 --> 02:48:02,150
like he was playing with it is pliable 
and then when you hit it with a hammer,

3567
02:48:02,151 --> 02:48:03,410
it's just hard.
Bang.

3568
02:48:04,210 --> 02:48:07,460
I just a million things coming.
Totally.

3569
02:48:07,740 --> 02:48:08,290
It,
it.

3570
02:48:08,420 --> 02:48:13,420
And it's great because it's just going 
to make us all safer without and make 

3571
02:48:13,420 --> 02:48:13,420
us,
you know,

3572
02:48:13,420 --> 02:48:13,700
we're going to be able to do crazier 
things.

3573
02:48:13,701 --> 02:48:15,800
I think that's one of the things I've 
loved seeing about.

3574
02:48:16,100 --> 02:48:17,840
You've seen this in sports in the last 
10,

3575
02:48:17,841 --> 02:48:21,320
20 years there doing stuff when we were 
kids like bicycle riding,

3576
02:48:21,970 --> 02:48:23,750
you know,
I can't believe they're doing double,

3577
02:48:23,751 --> 02:48:25,370
triple stuff flips and stuff.

3578
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:30,620
Even in surfing the stuff they're doing,
the waves they're writing now,

3579
02:48:30,621 --> 02:48:32,270
you would've thought would've just 
killed everyone,

3580
02:48:32,271 --> 02:48:37,271
but they do it and you know,
that's one of the great things about a 

3581
02:48:37,271 --> 02:48:40,391
lot of the technologies just allows us 
to do new things we never thought 

3582
02:48:40,391 --> 02:48:41,120
possible and push ourselves to new 
limits.

3583
02:48:41,750 --> 02:48:45,380
And I think the future is probably a lot
bigger than the past has been.

3584
02:48:45,650 --> 02:48:48,140
So there's going to be a lot more 
craziness that we,

3585
02:48:48,141 --> 02:48:49,490
uh,
we all see in full,

3586
02:48:49,491 --> 02:48:54,491
I think every day there's so much.
So many companies working on the 

3587
02:48:54,491 --> 02:48:54,491
weirdest stuff.
Yeah,

3588
02:48:54,491 --> 02:48:59,381
I agree.
I think we could probably do another 

3589
02:48:59,381 --> 02:49:01,421
podcast in six months in everything 
we're talking about today will be 

3590
02:49:01,421 --> 02:49:04,361
obsolete now.
There'll probably be some new stuff six 

3591
02:49:04,361 --> 02:49:04,361
months down the line.
And that's,

3592
02:49:04,361 --> 02:49:06,680
that's a big part of what exponential 
growth is about,

3593
02:49:06,681 --> 02:49:06,890
right?

3594
02:49:06,890 --> 02:49:10,560
It's the growth happens so quickly that 
as time goes on,

3595
02:49:10,561 --> 02:49:11,940
it happens quicker and quicker and 
quicker.

3596
02:49:11,990 --> 02:49:12,690
Quicker,
quicker.

3597
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:13,740
Yeah.
Until it's just,

3598
02:49:14,040 --> 02:49:15,780
you know,
and then you say six months.

3599
02:49:15,781 --> 02:49:20,781
It could be three months at the time 
after and then one and a half of course 

3600
02:49:20,781 --> 02:49:21,090
that's pretty quick,
but eventually it will be like that.

3601
02:49:21,091 --> 02:49:25,280
Eventually it'll just be,
the spike is straight up and you know,

3602
02:49:25,320 --> 02:49:26,750
I'm not.
It's hard to.

3603
02:49:26,760 --> 02:49:28,830
It seems almost impossible to think like
that,

3604
02:49:28,831 --> 02:49:31,040
but when you actually look at the 
modeling it,

3605
02:49:31,041 --> 02:49:36,041
it actually is like that.
There are huge amounts of new companies 

3606
02:49:36,041 --> 02:49:37,140
working on stuff.
Every day they get an idea,

3607
02:49:37,141 --> 02:49:40,220
they think something else,
they get funding and they just,

3608
02:49:40,380 --> 02:49:42,660
you know,
it's crazy world we live in,

3609
02:49:42,661 --> 02:49:45,480
man.
It is crazy getting crazier.

3610
02:49:45,780 --> 02:49:50,780
Totally and changing rapidly and 
becoming more brilliant I think as as 

3611
02:49:50,780 --> 02:49:51,870
the,
as the days go by.

3612
02:49:52,170 --> 02:49:53,010
I agree.
Listen,

3613
02:49:53,011 --> 02:49:54,480
this has been a fascinating 
conversation.

3614
02:49:54,481 --> 02:49:56,430
I really appreciate you coming on the 
podcast.

3615
02:49:57,480 --> 02:50:02,480
If people want to reach you on twitter,
it's Zoltan Underscore Istvan Ist v a n 

3616
02:50:03,390 --> 02:50:08,390
z o l t a n underscore I,
s t e v a n a website.

3617
02:50:09,410 --> 02:50:10,590
It's.
Well,

3618
02:50:10,591 --> 02:50:14,520
there's two of them.
There's a transhumanist party.org,

3619
02:50:14,790 --> 02:50:17,070
and then there's a.
You can either go to Zoltan,

3620
02:50:17,100 --> 02:50:19,800
Istvan Dot Com,
and your book,

3621
02:50:19,950 --> 02:50:24,950
the novel.
My novel is the transhumanist wager and 

3622
02:50:24,950 --> 02:50:27,231
you can get it on Amazon.
The kindle is only ninety nine cents 

3623
02:50:27,231 --> 02:50:30,321
right now.
There's a special and then there's also 

3624
02:50:30,321 --> 02:50:30,321
a paperback copy if your readers want to
get it.

3625
02:50:30,390 --> 02:50:31,230
Beautiful.
Listen,

3626
02:50:31,231 --> 02:50:33,120
thank you very much.
I really appreciate you coming on.

3627
02:50:33,121 --> 02:50:34,990
It was really fascinating conversation 
APP.

3628
02:50:35,030 --> 02:50:36,240
Let's do it again,
but absolutely.

3629
02:50:36,241 --> 02:50:36,840
Thanks so much.
Oh,

3630
02:50:36,841 --> 02:50:41,841
it was fast and let's do it again in six
months when the world's gone to come 

3631
02:50:41,841 --> 02:50:41,841
even crazier.
Totally.

3632
02:50:41,841 --> 02:50:42,270
Thank you.
Appreciate it,

3633
02:50:42,271 --> 02:50:43,110
man.
Thank you very much.

3634
02:50:43,140 --> 02:50:44,520
All right folks.
We'll see you soon.

3635
02:50:44,670 --> 02:50:45,710
Bye.
Big Kiss Mom.

3636
02:50:59,660 --> 02:51:00,740
No.
