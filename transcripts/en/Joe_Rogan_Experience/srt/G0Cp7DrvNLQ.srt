1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,810
It makes it look like we're on a radio 
show.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,870
Yeah.
The Joe Rogan experience

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,890
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,800
Yes.
Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:20,150
welcome back.
Randall Carlson.

6
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:20,840
How are you,
sir?

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:21,830
I'm doing well.
Joe,

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,040
you freaked out the entire podcast 
population the last time you were here 

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,570
with your stories of cataclysmic 
disasters and,

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,010
and,
uh,

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,580
the,
uh,

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,890
ramifications of asteroidal impacts and 
just the,

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,020
just the,
the evidence that you presented was a 

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,710
real mindfuck as it were.
Well,

15
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:44,660
uh,
what can I say?

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,790
I apologize to all the listeners out 
there that might have had nightmares.

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,880
No worries.
I knew that was going to be the case 

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:54,880
though.
I knew after the first time I met you,

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,050
we had that long conversation in 
Atlanta.

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,500
I knew once you sat down for three hours
on a podcast and open up about that 

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,301
stuff,
it was really going to uncork a lot of 

22
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:07,301
people's domes.
Well,

23
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:11,370
you know,
ironically there's an upside to the 

24
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:11,370
whole thing.
Maybe we'll have time to get into that a

25
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,200
little bit today.

26
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,920
Yeah,
definitely.

27
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:17,921
So tell me,
you just returned from a long excursion 

28
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:21,371
with Graham Hancock if you want to bend 
that thing like that towards your face 

29
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:21,371
or probably work a little.
Yeah,

30
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:21,980
there you go.
Yeah,

31
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:26,981
there you go.
You just returned from a long excursion 

32
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:28,640
with Graham Hancock.
You guys were on the road.

33
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:32,630
And what was the nature of your trip?
Where we were.

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,730
I was taking Graham on a tour showing 
them some landscapes.

35
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,110
Um,
we were,

36
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,290
I could haul them to the landscapes of 
catastrophe because he's doing his 

37
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,180
secret two fingerprints of the gods.
And you know,

38
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:52,181
when he came out with that book in 1995,
he was theorizing that there had been 

39
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:55,790
this lost civilization in prehistoric 
times and you know,

40
00:01:55,791 --> 00:02:00,791
the critics,
the gist of most of what the critics 

41
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:04,331
were attacking him on and there were 
considerable attacks on him as a result 

42
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:06,950
of some of the things he put forward in 
that book was that,

43
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,730
well,
if there was this great civilization 

44
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:12,730
that had existed in,
you know,

45
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,060
somewhere back in prehistory.

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,650
Where's the evidence of it?
Where,

47
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,110
where is the worst of pottery?
You know,

48
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:23,111
where are the carvings were,
where is the infrastructure that would 

49
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:27,481
have existed and you know,
I don't know if he really had an answer 

50
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:32,321
for that other than the fact that there 
had been a cataclysmic events that had 

51
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:36,731
intervened between then and now,
but he wasn't really specific about what

52
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:39,710
the nature of those catastrophes 
actually,

53
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,770
we're in a lot of additional research 
has come out since 1995.

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,200
That basically opens the window onto 
those events that basically separates 

55
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:53,330
our modern history,
which,

56
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,930
you know,
the recorded history goes back five or 

57
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:58,930
6,000
years.

58
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,080
You,
when we look at

59
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,240
the emergence of modern civilization,
we would basically trace it back to nine

60
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:06,550
or 10,000
years ago with the emergence of,

61
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,610
of um,
uh,

62
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,450
you know,
agriculture,

63
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,010
a dispersion of languages,
the first cities and so forth.

64
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,040
When we go beyond that a few thousand 
years,

65
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,550
we're in a completely different world 
and I mean,

66
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:25,840
so completely different that it's almost
unrecognizable from our modern world.

67
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,270
If we started recreating maps,
a going backwards,

68
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:34,690
like taking snapshots of the planet 
every millennium,

69
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:39,691
going back,
what we would see is that going back to 

70
00:03:39,691 --> 00:03:42,631
seven or 8,000
years ago with the basic configuration 

71
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:44,500
of our planet would not change much.
Once we get 11,

72
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:45,760
12,
13,000

73
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:50,761
years ago,
the change has become profoundly 

74
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:53,401
dramatic.
We start seeing sea levels going down 

75
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,720
hundreds of feet.
We see massive ice sheets covering North

76
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,770
America and Europe and and lots of other
enormous changes.

77
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Beyond that is what I considered to be 
deep history because as we may have 

78
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:07,930
talked about in our last interview,
you know,

79
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,490
we modern humans have been on this 
planet for a 150 to 200,000

80
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:12,970
years.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,940
At least.
You know,

82
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,040
if we go back,
say I think the oldest modern human 

83
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,180
skeleton ever found was named Homo adult
too,

84
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,380
and he dates to about 180,000
years roughly if we think of a 

85
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,870
generation of humans is 25 years.
That's 7,000

86
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,871
generations of humans now.
So the question is,

87
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,900
what were we doing for all those 
thousands of generations until somebody 

88
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,500
finally realized,
Hey,

89
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:46,600
you know what,
we can plant crops,

90
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,070
we can,
you know,

91
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,860
we can build cities,
we can form communities,

92
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,350
you know,
we can invent language,

93
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:54,140
etc.
Etc.

94
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,760
WEll,
my contention is,

95
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,940
and I think the evidence that's 
accumulating supports this 

96
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,420
interpretation at what we're really 
seeing seven,

97
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:05,260
eight,
9,000

98
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:08,410
years ago,
is not the origins of civilization,

99
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:11,440
but the rebooting of civilization.
You see what I'm saying?

100
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,950
And when we go back and we realize that 
modern history is separated from deep 

101
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:23,461
history by this extraordinary series of 
events that transpired between about 11 

102
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,680
and 13 or 14,000
years ago.

103
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,310
Once We begin to recognize how extreme 
these these events were in remodeling 

104
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:35,830
our planet,
totally remodeling our planet,

105
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,250
it then becomes obvious to us why there 
is not a lot of hard evidence for 

106
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,490
whatever went on prior to these,
to these events.

107
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,870
And there's been some things that they 
found since then that have really sort 

108
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,421
of made graham hancock's theories become
more and more palatable to even 

109
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:58,040
mainstream scientists like go tap.
Exactly,

110
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,490
exactly.
Go back a good ang pedang.

111
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,860
These are apparently a structures that 
were buIlt at least 11 or 12,000

112
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:10,400
years ago.
And I'm waiting to find out the,

113
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:13,280
um,
the most recent ideas on him.

114
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:18,281
I think that probably they go back much 
older than that because from what graham

115
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,500
told me,
they're just only in the preliminary 

116
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,511
stages of being excavated.
So I believe rebecca tempe is less than 

117
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:25,820
10 percent excavated,
right?

118
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

119
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,480
So this is this enormous ruined that 
appears to be late pleistocene ice age 

120
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,640
in an age that apparently was 
deliberately buried.

121
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,770
Um,
which is interesting.

122
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:44,771
Brings up a very interesting issue.
Why would they deliberately buried and 

123
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:49,211
they noticed delivery deliberately 
buried because of the uniformity of the 

124
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:50,480
age of the dirt.
Is that when I questioned him on that,

125
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:55,481
because I wanted to know if it was 
because the first thing I thought to 

126
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,451
myself was it could be natural because I
have seen so many sedimentary deposits 

127
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:03,410
caused by great floods.
Graham assured me that that was,

128
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,040
that it was human.
It was deliberate.

129
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,960
It was not.
Because if it had been buried by floods,

130
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:12,200
your water,
there should be internal stratification.

131
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:16,650
That would be very obvious.
I've been giving it some thought and,

132
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:18,640
and you know,
what occurred to me was this and,

133
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,770
and I ran this by grand,
but I haven't gotten a response from 

134
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,721
them on this,
but I started thinking if it was 

135
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:28,721
deliberately buried,
why would they bury it?

136
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,250
Then I began thinking what we talked 
about last time when we were talking 

137
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,241
about the tin guscott vanity in siberia 
when you had this massive aerial 

138
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:37,700
detonation,
you know,

139
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:40,460
that was about a 15 megaton explosion.
Okay.

140
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:45,461
Now that's equivalent to our biggest 
hydrogen bombs that used to be in the 

141
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:47,840
american arsenal and it's just because 
of an asteroid that,

142
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,370
that blew up in our atmosphere,
but a 150 foot diameter asteroid,

143
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,790
which is not that big really relative 
into cosmic scale of things.

144
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,450
The point though is that it was moving 
really,

145
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:00,680
really fast.
You know,

146
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,000
is moving,
you know,

147
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,300
a rifle bullet,
let's say on average it's about a 

148
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:07,300
thousand feet per second.
Write a,

149
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,920
an asteroid coming into the atmosphere 
is going to be 20 or 30 times that 

150
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,590
velocity,
so it carries an enormous kinetic punch.

151
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:20,591
when it hits the atmosphere,
it explodes because of the fact that the

152
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:24,680
earth is not actually absorbing a lot of
that energy.

153
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,050
It's dispersed widely through the 
atmosphere.

154
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,110
Now,
think about this particularly during the

155
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:35,111
height of the cold war,
in order to protect our missile silos 

156
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:37,160
are super hard and command and control 
centers.

157
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,530
What did we do with them?
Put them on the ground,

158
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,850
put them under ground.
We buried him.

159
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,040
Exactly,
and that began.

160
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,160
I began to think perhaps could could 
explain why it was buried in order to 

161
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:53,261
preserve it against the possibility of,
of some kind of an aerial burst or or 

162
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,100
you know,
some kind of a,

163
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,120
a highly energetic event.
That seems a weird thing for 12,000

164
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:01,950
years ago.
No,

165
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,520
I mean,
what?

166
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:07,521
What do we have really no evidence 
whatsoever that anybody's capable of 

167
00:09:07,521 --> 00:09:09,030
doing anything like that that long ago,
but it was.

168
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,050
I think on the contrary,
I think that what we see at the very 

169
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,890
beginnings of recorded history,
it's an obsession with the sky,

170
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,800
you know,
and that's one of the points that graham

171
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,490
brings out in his work,
you know,

172
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:23,190
is that that humans,
our ancestors,

173
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,360
have 10,
12,

174
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:27,840
13,000,
or even much sooner than that ad had a,

175
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:32,841
um,
just an obsessive concern where the 

176
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:33,630
vents in the sky and you know,
all of these ancient structures,

177
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,810
whether we're talking about stonehenge 
and I'm sure it's going to be the same 

178
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:38,810
case with go beckley,
tappy,

179
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,080
when we look at these,
these,

180
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,410
this infrastructure from the messel 
ethic period through the neolithic 

181
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,150
period from six,
five,

182
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,200
4,000
years ago,

183
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:50,250
300 years ago.

184
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,610
What we see is that there's this concern
with astronomy.

185
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,550
You know,
you see the astronomical alignments that

186
00:09:56,551 --> 00:10:01,080
are built into these structures actually
allow some pretty sophisticated,

187
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,740
uh,
observations of,

188
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,080
of events happening in the sky.
And we can maybe pull up some stuff here

189
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,820
that I've brought today to look at.
But,

190
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:09,990
um,
yeah,

191
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:13,300
I think that it's highly plausible that 
people back then could have.

192
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,890
Because think about this again,
to try to put this in context.

193
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,540
How many generations ago was the primary
mode of human transportation?

194
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,880
Horseback,
not that many,

195
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,860
four or five generations,
and pretty crazy,

196
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,290
pretty crazy.
Now think 7,000

197
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,270
generations.
Are you going to tell me then and all of

198
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,070
that trance,
all of that time,

199
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:37,071
all of those generations of humans that 
have the same presumably intelligences 

200
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,900
our own because they've got the same 
brain size,

201
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:45,210
um,
that they're not going to be able to 

202
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:45,210
come up with some kind of a,
uh,

203
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,890
a transmitted tradition,
some type of,

204
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:47,620
of,
um,

205
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,670
you know,
the idea of somehow of culture,

206
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:52,860
of civilization,
of language,

207
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,730
of,
uh,

208
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,820
you know,
that's my point is that there was so 

209
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:58,820
much that has been lost.

210
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,370
And once we understand how dynamic this 
planet really is,

211
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,460
it'll become clear to us why we don't 
have the hard physical record of things 

212
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:10,350
going on 20 or 30,000
years ago.

213
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,940
To put it in perspective for people who 
have never studied ancient Egypt.

214
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,840
Cleopatra,
the pyramids of you.

215
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:23,841
If you look at the date of the pyramids,
that cleopatra is closer to us.

216
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,120
Yes,
than the pyramids were to clear path,

217
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,420
which is nuts.
It's crazy.

218
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,590
Stop and think about that.
Like,

219
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:34,200
wait a minute,
what was that old back then?

220
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,500
And they have found these little tiny 
airplanes inside the pyramids,

221
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,140
these little,
little,

222
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,750
miniature,
you know,

223
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,780
carved airplanes that looked like 
airplanes.

224
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:48,630
If someone's people have tried to saY,
well no,

225
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:51,480
they represent birds.
That doesn't look like a burden at all.

226
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:54,850
I mean they have a rudder and they look 
like planes.

227
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,430
Well yeah.
And,

228
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:56,590
and you know,
there are tradItions,

229
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:00,340
particularly the vedic traditions that 
are full of descriptions of flying off.

230
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,080
Yes.
The vimanas yeah,

231
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,730
exactly.
So what is that,

232
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,760
you know,
I'm not going to proclaim unequivocally 

233
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:08,760
it's,
it's,

234
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,870
it's airplanes,
but at the same time we got to keep an 

235
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,120
open mind about it.
And the point I'm trying to make is that

236
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:15,130
yeah,
there was so much time to transpired.

237
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,300
All kinds of things could have happened 
that have basically been erased.

238
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,600
Right?
And,

239
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,580
and hopefully by the end of today's 
interview you'll have a better,

240
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,030
clearer idea of specifically what some 
of those things really were.

241
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:33,060
So we're talking about a potential 
civilization of maybe tens of thousands 

242
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,200
of years of growth and if we're looking 
at what we're,

243
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,250
what we have from the beginning of the 
dawn of civilization that we believed 

244
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,900
mesopotamia somewhere around 70,000
years ago from that till today,

245
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,990
we're talking about maybe double or 
triple that was lost and these gigantic 

246
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,670
cataclysmic events may be 15,
20,000,

247
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:56,671
30,000
years of of human beings inventing 

248
00:12:56,671 --> 00:13:00,031
things,
people building upon the inventions of 

249
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,260
others expanding and then all of that 
wiped out.

250
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,770
We're rubbing sticks together again to 
start fires and then whatever memories 

251
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,900
are left,
people have to rebuild a generation or 

252
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:12,900
two ago.
It was easy to dismiss.

253
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,170
Ideas like that is fringe science.
Today as we sit here in 2015,

254
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,170
it's not nearly so easy to dismiss that 
anymore.

255
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,180
Particularly what we now know about the 
history of this planet that are truly 

256
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,211
dynamic.
It is bad and that we have in effect 

257
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:29,290
been sort of blessed the last six to 
10,000

258
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,570
years were they relatively stable 
climate.

259
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:35,470
And I'm going to show you some graphs 
here that really will blow your mind,

260
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,540
that really will,
will,

261
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,780
will underscore how significant some of 
these changes have been,

262
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,870
how profound some of them have been.
And once we,

263
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,910
once we know that,
begin to incorporate that into our 

264
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,041
thinking,
we realize we're going to have to kind 

265
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:50,110
of reevaluate our models of,
of prehistory.

266
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,090
Okay.
Well we have a new setup now.

267
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:57,091
So with the tricaster,
we're gonna allow randall to take 

268
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:58,690
control of the situation here.
If you're just listening to this,

269
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,410
this might be one of those podcasts 
where if you're one of those people that

270
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,440
listens to it on a commute,
you might want to go back and check out 

271
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,440
the,
uh,

272
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,650
well,
vimeo or youtube or those are the ones 

273
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:11,980
that use stream is going to give you a 
hd now too,

274
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,070
right?
We do.

275
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,840
Some people don't even know we do a hd 
video of this podcast as well.

276
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:20,650
So what is this oxygen isotopes in 
greenland?

277
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,600
oxygen isotopes in greenland.
Yeah.

278
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:27,601
What we're looking at here,
this goes back to the early nineties 

279
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,631
when glaciologists and paleo 
climatologist guys should study ancient 

280
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:35,110
climate extracted these ice cores from 
the summit of greenland,

281
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,140
and the reason they went to the summit 
was because they were looking for the 

282
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,150
most undistorted ice core records that 
they could find.

283
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:43,840
previous ice core extractions had been 
near the perimeter of the,

284
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:48,841
of the ice sheets in there.
The ice flow is much more dynamic,

285
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,770
so there was more distortion.
Your record.

286
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:52,040
So what

287
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,560
they did was they went to the very 
center of.

288
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,490
There was a european team and an 
american team,

289
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,100
and without getting into the,
into the background,

290
00:14:58,101 --> 00:15:00,740
basically the ice sheet there was almost
two miles thick.

291
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,440
It took them five years to drill 
through.

292
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,720
It was miles thick.
Yes.

293
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,700
Yet just think about how far like 
looking how far two miles away.

294
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,590
It's like,
what is a plane?

295
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,000
A plane is a mile in the air.
No,

296
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:13,630
no.
Well,

297
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,260
uh,
is going to be about 30,000

298
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:16,430
feet.
What's the mile?

299
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:18,180
Thirty 5,000
feet a mile.

300
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,370
Now human gut.
Remember this,

301
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:24,371
because it's going to be at number 5,280
feet is a mile is a mile right now the 

302
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:28,730
tallest building in downtown la is 
probably not over 800 feet.

303
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,740
Three hundred feet at the most.
No.

304
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Um,
I'm not sure I did look it up at one 

305
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:35,840
point.
What the tallest building was.

306
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:35,840
I don't remember what,
what it was.

307
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,380
I know the tallest building in atlanta 
is a thousand and 60 feet and um,

308
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,800
you know,
two miles,

309
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,820
you'd have to think of 10 of those 
stacked on top of each other to get a 

310
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:45,820
two mile thick sheet of ice.
That's,

311
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,280
that's an amazingly huge,
massive ice.

312
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,450
right?
And,

313
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,800
and,
and that's pretty much the summit of 

314
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:55,800
greenland.
right?

315
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,930
And what we're looking at on this,
on this graph here,

316
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,960
if you,
if you go down the left side of the 

317
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,570
graph,
this is the surface.

318
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,600
And then down here there's 1500.
You see right at the bottom,

319
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:07,580
that's 1500 meters,
right?

320
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,940
Fifteen hundred meters.
You figure there's about three point 

321
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:12,940
two,
eight feet per meter.

322
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,920
So that's going to be 45.
It's gonna be close to 5,000.

323
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:18,470
So this is,
this is 1500 meters.

324
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,960
Tufts aaliyah mile,
yeah,

325
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,040
a little less than a mile over here on 
the right is,

326
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,450
is the time in thousands of years before
the present.

327
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,510
So you go down right there,
there's a thousand years,

328
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:34,511
you go down,
there's 2000 down at the bottom you see 

329
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:34,511
10.
So that's 10,000

330
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:38,111
years ago.
Now basically what the oxygen isotopes 

331
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:41,561
through there are a proxy for 
temperature change adjacent to the ice 

332
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:41,870
mass.
Right?

333
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,790
And if you look at these,
these are snapshots basically taken like

334
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,570
every 10 years.
Right?

335
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,690
And once you see here is that the,
is the temperature is oscillating back 

336
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,360
and forth,
back and forth.

337
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:58,361
It's a two to four degrees centigrade.
Now to put this into context,

338
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,590
the concern,
you know,

339
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:04,591
we,
we got into this somewhat last time to 

340
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,121
hold issue of global warming and,
and I know that in some of the feedback 

341
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:11,231
we got some of the most critical 
comments came from people who didn't 

342
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:14,861
like me undermining this whole concept 
of global warming induced catastrophe,

343
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,730
right?
What we see here though is was clearly 

344
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:20,750
that the,
that the climate,

345
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:23,000
this is the 10,000
years that we're talking about here,

346
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:27,110
it's called the holocene by geologists.
It's oscillating back and forth,

347
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,500
two to four degrees centigrade every,
every 10,

348
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:31,610
20,
30 years.

349
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,200
Right?
So we're,

350
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,470
we're talking about a degree that has 
changed basically in the last century to

351
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,340
the century and a half,
right?

352
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:45,550
Which,
which really almost wouldn't even show 

353
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:45,550
up here.
You see,

354
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,180
but we're going down as we go down,
we'll see if you go to the right.

355
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,100
That means temperature's warming.
Did you go to the left?

356
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,050
It means it's cooling,
right?

357
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,870
And so as we go back down,
this is through the holocene.

358
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,340
We're going through here and if you 
look,

359
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,040
there's some interesting stuff going on 
right here at about 8,000,

360
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,780
200 years ago.
There's a really,

361
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,800
there's a spike Of cooling right there.
And that was very,

362
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:08,520
very significant cooling.
I mean that was probably a,

363
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,080
caused the glaciers worldwide to start 
growing again for short,

364
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:18,081
for a couple of centuries after they had
basically disappeared at the end of the 

365
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:22,130
ice age.
So this was a very significant event 

366
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,730
right here,
and then as we get down right here at 

367
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:25,730
10,000,
you see it starts deviating to the left,

368
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,350
it starts deviating to the cooler.
I'm going to go to the next slide.

369
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:31,080
Where do we take this graph and we turn 
it on its side.

370
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,100
And what I've done here is you see this 
is,

371
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,940
this is the present right here and this 
is basically 10,000

372
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:41,320
years ago over here on the right side 
and,

373
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,510
and I've drawn a level.

374
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,520
There's a level green line in here to 
kind of give you a comparison and you'll

375
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,240
notice something.
Here's this 8,000,

376
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:51,120
200 year ago cold spike,
right?

377
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,230
And then as we're going along here,
you'll notice something that the general

378
00:18:55,231 --> 00:19:00,231
amplitude of these oscillations starts 
increasing as we get closer to the 

379
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:00,240
present.
Can you see that?

380
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,350
Yeah,
it gets better.

381
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,140
And you'll also notice that it's 
dropping,

382
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:07,680
it's dropping below that green line and 
that means it's cooling.

383
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,840
So in the last 10,000
years,

384
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,260
we went from a period of considerable 
warmth in the immediate post glacial 

385
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,580
era.
And then it began to cool off around 

386
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:19,580
6,000
years ago,

387
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,700
5,000
years ago,

388
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,370
and I said,
begin to cool off the temperature.

389
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,190
Oscillations began to increase in 
magnitude.

390
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,490
Okay?
Which actually contradicts the computer 

391
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,740
models that are saying the amplitude of 
the oscillations is going to increase as

392
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:35,730
the climate gets warmer.

393
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,730
What we actually see from the greenland 
ice cores is the opposite of that.

394
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,350
And it's right here in this graph.
But what's really significant about this

395
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,970
is when we go back beyond 10,000
years ago,

396
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,090
whoa.
And we see this jesus christ.

397
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,340
Yeah.
For folks who listening,

398
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,400
there's a giant change.
I mean,

399
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,830
we're looking at a little tiny,
you know,

400
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,420
maybe millimeter left,
right?

401
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:00,870
Left,
right,

402
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,240
left,
right up until this point.

403
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:07,080
Now we're looking at huge changes.
Huge changes.

404
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,890
Wow.
Catastrophic changes of temperature.

405
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,960
Yeah.
And,

406
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,030
and here we're going back.
This is notice,

407
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,090
this is between a 11 right here,
roughly 11,600

408
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,040
years ago.
And about 14,000

409
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,600
years ago.
Look at what happened right here.

410
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:25,320
You can see right around 15,000
years ago,

411
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,500
the climate is is actually if we took 
this thing out of here,

412
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:33,501
you can see there's almost a a trend 
upwards that gets interrupted right 

413
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:34,980
here.
Boom,

414
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,180
instantly,
boom,

415
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,460
overnight jump overnight.
Overnight.

416
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:39,360
Yeah,
and in fact,

417
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:45,410
what has happened is if you go back 
through the literature of of climate 

418
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,130
change and you read the,
the estimates,

419
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,010
how long

420
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:53,010
it took for the planet to shift modes 
from full glacial to the interglacial 

421
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,690
like we're now 50,
75 years ago,

422
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,870
it was a thousand or more years,
thousands of years.

423
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,050
When radiocarbon dating came along in 
the fifties,

424
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,030
it began to compress and what happened 
is that if you look in the eighties,

425
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:12,031
they're talking about perhaps a century,
several centuries now comes the 

426
00:21:12,031 --> 00:21:14,560
greenland ice cores and other ice cores 
and other proxies,

427
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:19,561
deep sea corps and so forth,
and the correlation of all of this 

428
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:21,210
evidence and it goes from centuries,
two decades.

429
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,030
Well,
as the ability to perceive these changes

430
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:30,280
through with ever greater precision and 
ever greater resolution has evolved.

431
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:35,490
It's gotten to now where the change,
the climate change that took us from 

432
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,541
glacial interglacial happened in less 
than five years and that's what we're 

433
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,690
seeing right here in this graph.
That's what we're seeing.

434
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,840
So 2010 glacier,
2015 done ice age over the glacier.

435
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Yeah.
Bear in mind now that there was a 

436
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,120
considerable lag between the actual,
the,

437
00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:00,350
the manifestation of the glaciers 
because the glaciers didn't melt that 

438
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,070
quick because they're so huge.
Imagine it.

439
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:06,370
We had a big chunk of ice.
We had an ice sculpture here.

440
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:10,360
Right?
And if the temperature is 31 degrees,

441
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:15,361
it's not going to melt.
If you turn the temperature up to 70 

442
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:15,361
degrees,
right?

443
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:20,310
We could turn the temperature up in the 
matter and he could warm up the room in 

444
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,120
a matter of hours or minutes.
But it's gonna take a while for that ice

445
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:23,650
sculpture to melt.
There's going to be a lag,

446
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,690
right?
Although the change that led to that 

447
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,340
meltdown was virtually instantaneous.
You see so,

448
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,190
but in that,
in that period,

449
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:35,290
and it's the interim,
what we're seeing right here,

450
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,970
there was an extraordinary right here.
I think if I go to the next slide,

451
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:43,360
I think you know,
let's go to the next one.

452
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,150
Yeah.
I'm going to zoom in here so you can see

453
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:49,840
this.
There were two massive warming spikes.

454
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,990
One right here,
you can see that we're down here in full

455
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:55,720
glacial mode right there.
And then boom,

456
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,430
right there.
There's huge spike of,

457
00:22:57,431 --> 00:23:02,431
of warming.
Now what does that represent when it 

458
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:02,431
comes to like temperatures?
Uh,

459
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:05,140
that could be on the order of.
Well,

460
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,840
that would be about 10 to 12 degrees 
centigrade,

461
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:10,270
which would be about 18 degrees 
fahrenheit.

462
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,300
Average temperature,
which is a crazy,

463
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,360
crazy,
crazy change because they're scared of 

464
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,360
two degrees,
right?

465
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,360
Scared of two degrees.
And here we're looking,

466
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,050
we're scared to tutorees centigrade 
here.

467
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:25,051
We're looking at five,
six times that much in a matter of a 

468
00:23:25,051 --> 00:23:28,030
couple of years.
You'll see at this point,

469
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,580
we don't really have an explanation for 
this.

470
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,580
That's why I get really frustrated when 
somebody says to me,

471
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:35,420
oh,
the debate on climate change is over.

472
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,670
No,
no,

473
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:37,060
no,
we're,

474
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:37,510
we're,
we're,

475
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,600
we're in the infancy of understanding 
the climate of this planet.

476
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,630
And when we look at stuff like this,
you see,

477
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,640
um,
it really drives home that point.

478
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,650
And you can see here,
right here people,

479
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,700
people are saying when they're saying 
that the debate on climate change is 

480
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,351
over though,
is whether or not human beings have had 

481
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:56,840
an impact on it in current times.
No question.

482
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,080
We have had an impact.
No question of what the debate is.

483
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:01,490
Right?
Well,

484
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:05,660
if you say that the debate is about have
humans had an impact or not,

485
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,520
I think that there is no debate.
Yeah.

486
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:12,550
Humans have had an impact.
What they're looking at though in your 

487
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,310
mind is one aspect of a very 
multidimensional issue.

488
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:15,410
Yes.
Yes,

489
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,360
exactly,
exactly.

490
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,580
And,
and my,

491
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,550
my concern is,
is that we're going to get so focused on

492
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,580
carbon chains and carbon chains that 
we're not looking at any of these other 

493
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:27,580
factors.

494
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,140
Isn't that what people do though?
We concentrate on one aspect of things 

495
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,050
and it becomes like almost like a 
cultural meme and that it spreads.

496
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:39,470
And this is all people talk about.
It had been so many people.

497
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:44,471
I guarantee you that we're upset at what
you said have not researched climate 

498
00:24:44,471 --> 00:24:48,911
change at all.
They just have parroted the words of 

499
00:24:48,911 --> 00:24:48,980
people that they've heard on television 
that are experts.

500
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,640
Well,
you got this.

501
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,010
Well,
97 percent agree.

502
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,080
Well,
if you look into the origin of that,

503
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,500
it's pretty contrived.
It really is.

504
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,030
I mean,
how you come up with that and,

505
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,750
and we could do an hour long discussion 
on dan.

506
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,370
I don't really think we want to get into
that today,

507
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,940
but I,
I really feel like I should write an 

508
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,251
analysis of that.
The source of that 97 percent so called 

509
00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:13,490
consensus so that people can really see 
where it came from.

510
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
In a nutshell.
Basically it goes to three or four 

511
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,391
pieces of research.
Some surveys that went out that were 

512
00:25:22,391 --> 00:25:24,160
slanted right from the beginning.
It's such as a.

513
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,200
Do you feel that humans have an impact 
on climate?

514
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,020
Yes.
Nobody disagrees with that.

515
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:34,550
So you can go through all the whoever 
these so-called deniers are.

516
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,290
I have looked and looked.
Who's,

517
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:41,350
who's denying?
Is there any climate scientists on any 

518
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,940
anywhere on the spectrum that denies 
that the climate changes or that denies 

519
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,051
that humans have had an influence on the
climate and I haven't found a single 

520
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:50,051
one.
So in other words,

521
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:51,730
these deniers that you hear about,
you know,

522
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,890
the climate change deniers,
they don't really exist.

523
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,950
There are those who criticize the 
consensus view,

524
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,260
right?
That the dominant mode of climate change

525
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:05,261
is being induced by humans and they are 
being shoved into this camp of climate 

526
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:06,710
change deniers,
but they're not.

527
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,110
They're absolutely not climate change 
deniers.

528
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,570
And when you look at it,
stuff like this,

529
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,690
you know,
a lot of these guys who would question 

530
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,611
the so called anthropogenic climate 
change consensus are guys who have done 

531
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:19,850
this work.
Now this work is how old?

532
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,500
How?
Well,

533
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,770
let's go.
This goes to the.

534
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,820
This goes back to the,
to these are the,

535
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,650
this work that I'm showing you here.
It was published in [inaudible] 93.

536
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,600
The,
the,

537
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,540
the,
the,

538
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,320
the greenland ice sheet project and the,
the greenland ice sheet project into 

539
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,990
greenland.
Oh,

540
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:42,770
I forget it was grip and just the two.
It was a european and an american team.

541
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:46,560
They five years drilling,
so these are the most accurate proxies.

542
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:51,420
We have it in hand and they're pulling 
tubes of ice is just like a cylinder.

543
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,450
Yeah,
like cylinders picture maybe six inches 

544
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,521
in diameter,
so they have like a circular cutting 

545
00:26:58,521 --> 00:27:01,101
thing and they have a circular cutting 
drill that extracts these ice cores and 

546
00:27:01,101 --> 00:27:04,260
for the last 20 years they've been 
analyzing the ice core,

547
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:09,261
you know,
it took five years to get them out and 

548
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:10,440
it's been 20 years now of analyzing what
they're telling us.

549
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,500
So before they had all these ice cores,
when they were saying that this climate 

550
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,920
change took thousands of years,
was that just guessing?

551
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,280
Pretty much based.
That was based upon actual empirical 

552
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,960
observations of ice glaciers receding as
a result of the modern warming because 

553
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:33,870
you have to understand up until about 
the middle of the 19th century,

554
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:38,871
we were in the middle of what was has 
commonly been referred to as the little 

555
00:27:38,871 --> 00:27:39,490
ice age.
And,

556
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,420
and this is another thing that's 
important to put into context.

557
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,230
The ice.
The little ice age was in two phases.

558
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,920
the earliest phase came on in about the 
mid 13 hundreds,

559
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,130
then it warmed for about a century into 
15,

560
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,650
16 hundreds,
and then the second phase came on.

561
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,310
During that time,
the glaciers worldwide began to grow,

562
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,360
and most of the evidence today suggests 
that during the little ice age,

563
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,840
glaciers were bigger than they had been 
in 10,000

564
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:07,350
years.

565
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,530
So around the middle of the 19th 
century,

566
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:12,330
around 1850,
give or take,

567
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:17,331
a decade or two,
the climate began to warm out of the 

568
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:18,600
little ice age and glaciers began to 
receive.

569
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:24,050
Right now,
if we look at glacier recession that's 

570
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,021
going on right now,
and it's been going on for the last 10 

571
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:29,601
or 20 years,
what we see is it's basically a 

572
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:32,391
continuation of the recession.
It's been going on for 160 or 170 years.

573
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:39,140
Right?
So it's important to establish what's 

574
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,370
our baseline when we're comparing modern
recession of glaciers.

575
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Bear in mind that our baseline is we're 
starting from the glaciers being bigger 

576
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,600
than they had been in 10,000
years.

577
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,350
Right?
So the.

578
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:56,530
I think then we have to understand that 
that that little ice agent in fact had 

579
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,140
some pretty serious consequences for 
civilization.

580
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,370
We can see that there were two period in
the last 2000 years.

581
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,460
There were two periods of of global 
cooling.

582
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,980
One of them occurred in the sixth 
century.

583
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,990
It actually now can be accurately dated 
to occurring between 5:36

584
00:29:12,991 --> 00:29:14,940
and 5:44
a d,

585
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:21,050
which is a very interesting time.
This was basically the time that 

586
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,321
historians have have for for decades 
said this was the onset of the dark 

587
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:29,151
ages.
It's also the time during which all of 

588
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,560
the arthurian myths and the grail quest 
stories are placed.

589
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,980
You know arthur arthur,
his desk death is,

590
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,850
is traditionally placed at the battle of
cam land or cam lawn,

591
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,550
which is usually dated at about five a 
which,

592
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,910
which basically culminated this quest 
for the grail.

593
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,730
Right.
WhAt was the other grail?

594
00:29:48,731 --> 00:29:53,731
Stories themselves were,
were set down in writing between about 

595
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:58,321
1130 and 1230 d in this really 
interesting time during the middle ages.

596
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:02,290
At the same time that the great 
cathedrals were being built.

597
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:08,580
When the cath,
our movement was at its strongest when 

598
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,150
tonight knights of the temple were at 
their strongest,

599
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:12,730
um,
when cobble ism schools were flourishing

600
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:17,731
in Spain,
when the troubadours we're making their 

601
00:30:17,731 --> 00:30:17,800
circuits around europe,
uh,

602
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,230
you know,
spreading news and entertainment,

603
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:25,231
but really probably carrying a esoteric 
information to the initiates that had 

604
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:30,991
the key to the,
to the secret language that they use 

605
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:30,991
there.
It was very interesting time,

606
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,890
but it was in that 12,
82,

607
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,110
1130 to 1230,
that the,

608
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,780
that,
the grail stories were written down.

609
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:43,470
Now the grail stories actually refer 
back to this period of the arthurian 

610
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,700
days,
and the quest for the grail,

611
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:47,100
if you recall,
was that the,

612
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:52,260
that the land had succumbed to blight.
It had become a wasteland.

613
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:57,510
England who had become a wasteland.
And the idea of the grail was it was the

614
00:30:58,301 --> 00:31:03,301
grail not only restored the wasteland 
restored the king,

615
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,790
because remember the king,
whether it was king arthur or braun,

616
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:11,410
or on toss or the fisher king,
there were different names and different

617
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:11,740
stories.

618
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,990
It was the same deal.
He was sick,

619
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:15,880
he was in decline.
He was wounded,

620
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:19,480
the wound wouldn't heal,
he was debilitated,

621
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,330
and the only way to restore him was to 
find the grail,

622
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,600
bring the grail back,
allowing to drink from the grail,

623
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:30,601
but the grail was also the means of 
restoring the wasteland to fertility and

624
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,130
fecundity.
Now,

625
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:38,020
here's where it gets interesting,
is that the dendro chronologists who who

626
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:43,021
studied tree rings have been looking at 
that period exactly in that period that 

627
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,610
the,
that the tradition places,

628
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,110
the grail quest and have discovered that
for about eight or 10 years,

629
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:53,500
forest growth in the northern hemisphere
almost came to a screeching halt.

630
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,920
And this is now been well documented.
Mike bailey,

631
00:31:56,921 --> 00:32:01,921
who's has done most of this work,
I'm basically showing that there was a 

632
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,710
serious global cooling that took place 
during those years.

633
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,640
And the historical record of that seems 
to confirm because there's multiple 

634
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,110
descriptions from irish monks and saw on
describinG how for weeks at a time the 

635
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,120
sun is not visible,
that you know,

636
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:21,040
that it's darkness has come over tHe 
land,

637
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:26,041
that there were reports of these 
mysterious fogbugz and then there are 

638
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,730
multiple collapses of agriculture.

639
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,200
Okay?
So,

640
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,980
uh,
as a result of these multiyear collapses

641
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:35,950
of agriculture because of the cold and 
the dark and damp,

642
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,010
um,
people got malnourished and then you had

643
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,060
famine as a result of famine.
People be there,

644
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,800
their immune systems became weakened.
And then in five,

645
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:50,801
42 a d,
you had the onset of the justinian 

646
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:54,431
plague,
which wiped out maybe a third of the 

647
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,011
population of europe.
Whole whole villages disappeared as a 

648
00:32:57,011 --> 00:32:59,720
consequence.
Now these events pretty much followed in

649
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:00,830
sequence.
You see,

650
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,720
the cold brought about the collapse of 
agriculture.

651
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,740
The collapse of agriculture brought 
about famine.

652
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:09,830
Famine brought about weakness.
And as a result,

653
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:15,220
boom you have flag.
Now it took european civilization nearly

654
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:20,591
three centuries to recover from that.
Now what brought about the recovery was 

655
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,130
the return of warmth to the world,
what is called the medieval warm period.

656
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:30,730
And between this began really to occur 
in about 900 add this sea ice began to 

657
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:35,120
retract back well inside the arctic 
circle,

658
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:37,880
which opened up the sea lanes between 
northern europe,

659
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,290
Iceland,
and greenland.

660
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,420
And so it was this period of time that 
the,

661
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,840
that the,
that the vikings were able to sail to 

662
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,151
Iceland and then sailed to greenland and
actually establish a colonies on the 

663
00:33:49,151 --> 00:33:50,150
west coast of greenland,
greenland,

664
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:55,151
and farm or the.
Now the ground is perennially 

665
00:33:55,151 --> 00:33:55,151
perennially frozen.
Let me try that again.

666
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Per yeley frozen,
right?

667
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,520
So it was clearly a warm period.
And what happened was,

668
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,640
if you look back now at the studies from
that medieval warm period,

669
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,540
you see that agriculture rebounded 
suddenly.

670
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:12,550
People had lots of food to eat.
I'm actually studies of skeletons show 

671
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:17,210
that the stature of humans during this 
period of time increased by four or five

672
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:20,270
inches on average from what it had been 
during the dark ages.

673
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:25,930
And I'm now europe started becoming 
wealthy because the basis of all wealth 

674
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,280
basically was,
was agriculture was food,

675
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,450
right?
Without that,

676
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,800
you don't have anything else.

677
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,150
Population began to expand enormously.
You see other things going on.

678
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:37,460
Um,
lifespans increase,

679
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,520
a infant mortality decrease.
All of this stuff has been well 

680
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:42,800
documented in a whole variety of 
studies.

681
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,850
Well,
after about a century and a half of this

682
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:51,970
warmth with the,
with the concomitant wealth that came 

683
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,331
along,
european society was wealthy enough to 

684
00:34:55,331 --> 00:34:58,100
undertake this extraordinary cathedral 
building phase.

685
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:02,360
You see where you had literally hundreds
of thousands of highly trained,

686
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:05,420
highly skilled crafts people working on 
these things.

687
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:10,421
You had essentially,
when you begin to look at the cathedral 

688
00:35:10,421 --> 00:35:14,081
building phenomenon,
it required the basically the 

689
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:17,570
mobilization of of the whole of european
society behind this enterprise,

690
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,130
because you had to cory mounts of stone,
you had to transport these stones,

691
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:25,220
you had the car of the stones,
you look at the statuary,

692
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:28,190
the stain glass,
which is exceptional,

693
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:32,840
and it's in its refractive properties 
that really have still not been mimicked

694
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,500
to this day.

695
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:38,500
The way the stained glass was able to 
refract light so that it gives the 

696
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,460
appearance of of not the light coming 
shining through the glass,

697
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,840
but emanating from within the glass and 
you could go on and on with this.

698
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:46,160
ThE,
the,

699
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:47,660
the,
the carpentry scaled,

700
00:35:47,661 --> 00:35:52,661
the engineering skill,
the astronomy that went into these 

701
00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:55,851
structures.
All of this combined basically shows up 

702
00:35:55,851 --> 00:36:00,350
basically in historical instant and in 
what's interesting is the scarcity of,

703
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,680
of evidence showing what proceeded this.
How did these,

704
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,190
who organized this,
who raised the money,

705
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:12,960
who trained the craftsman,
you know,

706
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:14,130
this is,
there are,

707
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,370
there are references to this in history,
but really,

708
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,970
you know,
there's no explicit detailed discussion 

709
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:22,970
where we can go and trace it and say,
okay,

710
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,060
this is,
this is how it happened.

711
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:29,410
You know,
but it's important to realize that this 

712
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:29,610
was a consequence of the,
uh,

713
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:31,020
of the,
uh,

714
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,760
you know,
the expansion of,

715
00:36:32,761 --> 00:36:35,700
of,
of wealth in european society that,

716
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,940
that was able to allow this to happen.

717
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,240
And that's as a consequence of the 
warmth,

718
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,360
the warmth of the earth.
And what we see is that the cathedral 

719
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,001
building era comes to a sudden 
termination in nearly 13 hundreds.

720
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,400
And if you Go on your travel around a 
cathedrals,

721
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:54,900
you'll find that there is,
in many cases,

722
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:59,901
you know,
the record suggests that it's almost as 

723
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:02,241
if in the middle of their work,
the workman laid down their tools and 

724
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:06,171
left in some cases.
And this is why there were so many 

725
00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:06,540
cathedrals of the great ones that 
weren't finished.

726
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:11,890
Okay.
but what you see is that exactly 

727
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:16,170
concurring with the cessation of 
cathedral building within a day,

728
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,200
within a few decades anyway,
was the onset to the little ice age and 

729
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,671
the return of the cold and this first 
phase of the little ice age again 

730
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:28,830
brought about agricultural collapses at 
brought about famine.

731
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:31,440
And then you had the black plague that 
showed up,

732
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:32,700
I think around,
whAt was it?

733
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,880
13 slash 30 slash 1340 right in there 
again,

734
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,200
decimated the civilization of europe.
So you can see,

735
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:43,620
I mean if we look at the historical 
record,

736
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:48,621
what we see is the times of,
of global warming have actually been 

737
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:52,080
times of advancement in civilization.
Now,

738
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:52,950
of course,
That there,

739
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,900
that would have its limit.
I mean we could get to,

740
00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:00,110
you know,
at some point where we would get too 

741
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,120
warm in yours.
But so far what we've seen,

742
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,780
we're at this point well within the 
range of natural variability.

743
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,260
That's the why is this never brought up 
by anybody but you.

744
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,830
I've never heard anybody else discuss 
this,

745
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,730
this very controversial subject.
It's controversial because everyone's so

746
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:17,340
fixated on global warming being a bad 
thing.

747
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,130
It's there.
It's there for anybody who is willing to

748
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,560
do their homework,
you know,

749
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:25,590
and if somebody goes on my website or 
whatever and says,

750
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:26,490
what are your sources?

751
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:29,940
I'm glad to provide multiple,
multiple sources going back.

752
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:34,941
I've been,
I've been collecting this data for 

753
00:38:34,941 --> 00:38:34,941
decades,
you know,

754
00:38:34,941 --> 00:38:35,410
and it's there and I have to ask the 
same question.

755
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,280
Why are we ignoring this evidence?
You know,

756
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,080
why are we.
Well,

757
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,280
the,
I think we're ignoring it because 

758
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,291
climate change has become a political 
agenda rather rather than a scientific 

759
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:48,190
question,
you know,

760
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,000
and so because there are political 
factions that are lined up behind it.

761
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,590
Um,
you know,

762
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,930
the inner intergovernmental panel on 
climate change is now looked at as being

763
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:02,080
the ultimate source for data on,
on the climate.

764
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:08,100
And bear in mind,
they were created by the united nations 

765
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,371
framework convention on climate change 
and given the mandate of go out there 

766
00:39:11,371 --> 00:39:11,500
and demonstrate that humans are causing 
climate change.

767
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:13,480
So right from the very start,
that was their mission.

768
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:19,080
And they were not told go and look for 
natural causes of natural climate 

769
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,660
variability,
study the human and.

770
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,660
And it's important and I mean I'm not at
all saying it's not important for us to 

771
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,170
study our own effects on climate,
but it's going to be dangerous.

772
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:31,420
I think if,
if we neglect,

773
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,750
you know,
what we're seeing right here on these 

774
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,521
graphs or this graph that I'm showing 
you because that's clearly not carbon 

775
00:39:38,521 --> 00:39:38,920
dioxide.
See if we're told,

776
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:43,921
and we have been repeatedly told that 
carbon dioxide concentrations in the 

777
00:39:43,921 --> 00:39:46,750
atmosphere held relatively steady at 
about 280 parts per million,

778
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:52,530
right?
Prior to the industrial revolution and 

779
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:52,780
only subsequent to the industrial 
revolution.

780
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,870
Did cArbon dIoxide start going up?
Well,

781
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,550
if we assume just for the sake of 
argument that,

782
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,770
that.
That's correct.

783
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:05,220
We'll look at this graph.
What we're saying is that if carbon 

784
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,510
dioxide held steady at 280 parts per 
million going back hundreds of thousands

785
00:40:07,511 --> 00:40:11,560
of years as al gore is actually stated,
and as many others have stated,

786
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:15,340
it's not carbon dioxide driving those 
climate changes,

787
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:15,640
is it?

788
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,670
well,
it can't be that it can't be new.

789
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,540
if that's the case,
and that's hard science,

790
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,100
this is hard science,
right?

791
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,850
It's hard science as well.
You're.

792
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:24,790
You're looking at something really 
crazy.

793
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,160
Some event.
Yeah.

794
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,760
Yeah.
That's my point.

795
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,070
Now the alternative is,
okay,

796
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,360
are we saying if,
if,

797
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:36,630
if carbon dioxide is the dominant driver
of climate change and that's what we're 

798
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:41,431
seeing here,
then what that basically says is that 

799
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:45,931
there is some gigantic unknown 
reservoirs of co two that have outgassed

800
00:40:46,421 --> 00:40:51,421
into the atmosphere,
which again undermines the so called 

801
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:52,670
consensus view because so far the 
consensus view,

802
00:40:52,671 --> 00:40:57,671
the consensus view states that the ceo 
has only increased because of burning 

803
00:40:57,821 --> 00:41:02,821
fossil fuel.
So this graph is the real inconvenient 

804
00:41:02,821 --> 00:41:04,750
truth.
This graph that's well put.

805
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:09,780
Yes,
this graph is the real inconvenient 

806
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:09,940
truth and when we look at some of this,
I mean right there,

807
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,240
that is a major global warming right 
there because this dashed line 

808
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,040
represents the modern temperature like 
the date,

809
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,750
the 20th century average is this dash 
line,

810
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,480
that dash line.
What year are we looking at?

811
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,530
Right there,
right here.

812
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:26,620
This is between 100 and 150,000
years ago,

813
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,650
and that's a giant jump.
That's a gIant joe.

814
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,580
I mean,
so what,

815
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:33,130
what does that represent as far as 
degrees in temperature?

816
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,830
Oh,
well,

817
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:34,040
let's

818
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,630
see.
That's probably going to be,

819
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:37,580
you know,
15 to 18 degrees fahrenheit.

820
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,370
Whoa.
Yeah,

821
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,440
right there.
So that's,

822
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,160
you know,
again,

823
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,760
15 to 18 times greater than the,
than the,

824
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:47,720
the presumed temperature increase of the
last century.

825
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,750
Is there any mainstream,
I shouldn't say mainstream scientific 

826
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,510
explanation for what that is?
No.

827
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:57,260
Well,
it's called the eemian called the eemian

828
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,590
periods in interglacial period,
but even within the interglacial period,

829
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:03,140
you see that there are these massive 
oscillations,

830
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,230
massive cooling,
cooling and warming again.

831
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:11,260
Yeah.
And so there's a variability if you're 

832
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:11,990
saying the warming is between it's 18 
degrees.

833
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:14,420
That what you said to up to that.
So the cooling,

834
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,870
you're talking about almost that much in
the other direction.

835
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,190
The other direction.
Yeah.

836
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,130
And who you're talking about this over a
period of just a few decades.

837
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,170
Well,
as we get back this far,

838
00:42:24,171 --> 00:42:27,140
we don't have the same degree of 
precision is we do when we're,

839
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:27,860
we're here.

840
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,990
um,
perhaps yes,

841
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,080
but we were not sure,
but we do know that these changes that 

842
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,430
we're looking at here,
the terminated the last ice age.

843
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,860
We're just in a matter of a few years.
Yeah,

844
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:45,340
for sure.
And the instantaneous nature of those is

845
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:50,381
what you focus on when you start talking
about asteroidal impacts and things 

846
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:53,390
along those lines of that is something 
that we can explain.

847
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:56,840
It's something you can point to by 
default.

848
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,900
There doesn't seem to be a lot of other 
things that we can invoke to explain 

849
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:06,400
what we're seeing right here.
And there's absolute evidence that we 

850
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,510
have been hit multiple times.
We're going to get into that.

851
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:09,590
Yes,
yes.

852
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,650
And,
and that's a big part of what,

853
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,550
what graham's book is going to be 
amazing.

854
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:18,551
when you look at the ancient history,
I mean it's not even ancient as far as 

855
00:43:18,551 --> 00:43:20,030
me and they were human beinGs living 
sort of like us,

856
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,840
but how much different the climate was 
like,

857
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:25,280
it was so fucked up.

858
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,650
Well,
I'm not sure about the west coast,

859
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:30,350
but I know on the east coast there were,
you know,

860
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:34,760
swarms of icebergs stranding,
like off the coast of South Carolina,

861
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,620
for example,
you know,

862
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,370
there was no great lakes because of the 
great lakes were under thousands of feet

863
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:41,210
of ice,
you know,

864
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,100
New York,
boston,

865
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,870
detroit,
um,

866
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,550
seattle,
portland,

867
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,920
or not sort of a portland,
but seattle,

868
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,810
twin cities,
chicago.

869
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:53,960
All of these areas were under thousands 
of feet of ice,

870
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,740
thousands of feet.
And we're not talking millions of years 

871
00:43:59,740 --> 00:43:59,740
ago.
We're talking 12,

872
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,570
13,000
to 25 to 30,000

873
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:04,070
years ago.
That's incredible.

874
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:04,780
It is.
And,

875
00:44:04,781 --> 00:44:07,940
and sea levels were basically in round 
numbers,

876
00:44:07,941 --> 00:44:12,941
400 feet lower than now,
which essentially exposes the entire 

877
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,170
con.
Most of the continental shelves.

878
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:16,190
And I'm going to,
I've got some,

879
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,440
some interesting graphics here to show 
you,

880
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:19,840
uh,
what,

881
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,430
what continental coastlines would have 
looked like.

882
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:27,490
There was an article that I was reading 
recently about aborigines in aboriginal 

883
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:27,650
tales of,
uh,

884
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,890
of the lowered,
like lowered levels

885
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:37,110
that they're starting to correspond now 
with actual climate data and 

886
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:37,800
understanding of what the sea levels 
actually war at that time.

887
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,230
And these are stories that are 
supposedly 10,000

888
00:44:40,231 --> 00:44:45,231
years old pass through oral traditions.
These traditions to me are just beyond 

889
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:47,500
valuable,
you know,

890
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,080
up until very recently they have been 
considered basically just,

891
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,300
you know,
interesting in the,

892
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:59,350
in the,
in the anthropological or psychological 

893
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:02,121
sense,
but had no real hard scientific 

894
00:45:02,121 --> 00:45:06,680
credibility to them.
Now I think we're beginning to 

895
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,281
reevaluate them near as an archeologist,
this archeologist by the name of Bruce 

896
00:45:10,281 --> 00:45:15,170
Massey,
who's been doing some very interesting 

897
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,560
work in for the last 20 years analyzing,
uh,

898
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:21,590
many of these ancient myths and 
realizing and putting out there the 

899
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:26,031
argument that these,
that these myths and these legends in 

900
00:45:26,031 --> 00:45:29,721
these epic tales a code really hard 
scientific information that we could 

901
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:34,640
extract from them.
And I'm talking about global changes and

902
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,840
astronomical events and so forth.

903
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,990
And,
and um,

904
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:43,820
so,
and I've been a believer in that for a 

905
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:43,820
long time,
you know,

906
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,180
and this is one of the premises of 
graham's work is that,

907
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:50,690
that the myths and the legends actually 
have a great deal to teach us beyond 

908
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:55,251
just the psychological orientation of 
our ignorant pre-scientific ancestors,

909
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,730
you know.
But yeah,

910
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,210
a good point you make there.
Um,

911
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:02,010
when we look at this graph,
basically what we're seeing here is that

912
00:46:02,011 --> 00:46:05,100
coming out of the ice age,
you can kind of see that we're coming up

913
00:46:05,101 --> 00:46:10,101
here and then we have this massive spike
of warming and then it seesaws back down

914
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:15,600
into this full glacial cold.
This is called this period between these

915
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:18,720
two green arrows is called the younger 
dryas,

916
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:24,410
which is named after a polar wildflower 
that had disappeared in northern europe 

917
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:27,510
and then suddenly came back again.
It only grows in polar environments,

918
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,280
a dry us octa patella.

919
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,840
So the younger dryas compared because 
there was an older darius too,

920
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:39,230
but it lasted.
Now the dates are placing it from 

921
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:39,390
roughly 12,000,
900 years ago,

922
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:42,960
give or take a few decades to 11,600
years ago.

923
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,360
So this spike of warming right here is 
11,600

924
00:46:48,361 --> 00:46:49,380
years.
Now,

925
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:54,381
if we look at the next one here,
this graph basically goes to a different

926
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:59,220
realm of evidence.
and what this shows is the average,

927
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:04,250
the rate of sea level rise.
You see now oceanographers marine 

928
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:07,860
geologists have been studying.
There'S,

929
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,010
there's a number of dIfferent ways they 
can correlate this information.

930
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:14,010
They can look at actual evidence of 
submerged shorelines,

931
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:16,790
right?
They can look at changes in the,

932
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,370
in the flora and the fauna that have,
that have lived in the oceans.

933
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,750
They can look at coRal reefs.
Uh,

934
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,980
there's a lot of different things that 
they can pull together to see how 

935
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,230
rapidly sea levels rose at the end of 
the last ice age and again,

936
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,820
generation or two ago.

937
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,820
The assumption was is that there was a 
smooth continuum of rise that took tens 

938
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:39,610
of thousands of years,
right?

939
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:43,690
To get us from minus 400 feet up to what
we are now.

940
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:47,050
At the present level,
what this graph shows is that there were

941
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:50,950
two massive spikes of meltwater 
introduced into the oceans,

942
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,410
into the global oceans at the end of the
last ice age,

943
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:58,770
and you can see The first spike called 
meltwater pulse one a is the biggest 

944
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,290
followed by another one,
meltwater pulse one b.

945
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:07,980
If we go back to this graph right here,
those two spikes of glacial melt water 

946
00:48:09,281 --> 00:48:12,970
and sea level rise coincided with this 
warming spike and net warming spike,

947
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:17,971
and you can see how this warming spike 
seems to be the most intense followed by

948
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:21,520
this one.
And we see that meltwater pulse one a is

949
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:24,740
the biggest.
So what this is showing is that the,

950
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,340
that the rise in sea level was not as 
smooth.

951
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,960
It was like,
whoa.

952
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:34,620
And then warm up again.
So there was something that caused all 

953
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,890
those glaciers to melt within just a 
very short amount of time.

954
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,420
A geologically speaking,
yes,

955
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:39,490
a geological instant.
Exactly.

956
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,180
What's further interesting is when we 
look at this graph,

957
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,510
this is the late pleistocene mortality 
graph,

958
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:51,780
and each square represents a fossil 
specimen of an extinct mammal.

959
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,760
You know,
could be a woolly mammoth,

960
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,060
could be a giant ground sloth,
could be a saber tooth cat,

961
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:03,090
could be the giant cave bear roughly 120
species of mega mammals that lived 

962
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:10,350
during the ice age when extinct right at
the end of the ice age in basically what

963
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:16,240
this graph is showing us here is that 
you probably can't read this here,

964
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:18,940
so oh interpreted for you.
if you go back to here,

965
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:24,360
the left side represents 50,000
years ago and here were where the cursor

966
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:26,110
is.
That's 40,000

967
00:49:26,111 --> 00:49:28,060
years,
30,000,

968
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,480
20,000,
and you see that as we're going along 

969
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:33,480
here.

970
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,010
Each one of these squares represents the
finding of a fossil,

971
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,130
of an extinct mammal in the,
in the fossil record.

972
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,500
What we see from this graph is that when
we get to between 11 and 13,000

973
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:49,501
years ago,
there's a massive spike of calendar 

974
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:52,590
shoots through the roof.
This demise of these animals directly 

975
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:56,170
coincided directly coincides with this 
right here directly.

976
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:02,550
Now what we,
what we're dealing with is that for 50 

977
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:06,061
years the dominant theory has been,
is called overkill or blitzkrieg and 

978
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:11,340
this theory basically states that bands 
have paleo.

979
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:14,050
Indian hunters came across the bering 
land bridge,

980
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:19,140
slaughtering every animal that they 
encountered along the way and somehow 

981
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:23,821
within less than a thousand years,
swept from siberia down to tierra del 

982
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:26,650
fuego and killed off every willie,
every man within the world,

983
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,890
and presumably every other of the 
extinct mammals.

984
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:32,510
And that has been the dominant theory 
that,

985
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,480
that humans caused this mass extinction.

986
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,300
And personally I think that's just 
absurd because for one thing,

987
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:46,540
based upon anthropological studies,
there were possibly more wooly mammoths 

988
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,470
in the world and there were people for 
awhile.

989
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,970
Um,
you know,

990
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:54,971
you have to assume that the blitz creek 
was so instantaneous and so all 

991
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:57,250
encompassing that there was no time even
for the mammas to,

992
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,510
to reproduce.
Of course,

993
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,960
the overkill hypothesis basically 
addresses itself only to Willie May or 

994
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,280
only to mammoths.
Wooly mammoths were one species of four 

995
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,221
different species of mammals.
But what about the other roughly 120 

996
00:51:12,221 --> 00:51:12,221
species?
What about the,

997
00:51:12,221 --> 00:51:17,000
the giant armadillos into a giant 
beavers in the american place to see 

998
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,360
lion that was as big as big as a horse.
Uh,

999
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,290
You know,
the list goes on and on and on and on in

1000
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:26,291
these animals all basically disappeared 
during this spike that you see right 

1001
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:30,611
here.
And that spike faults exactlY between 

1002
00:51:30,611 --> 00:51:31,670
these two warming spikes and between the
two sea level rises.

1003
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,990
So all the data,
all points that same time period.

1004
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,520
Yes.
Wow.

1005
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:40,100
And so what I'm saying,
and this is,

1006
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:41,810
this is,
uh,

1007
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:47,190
you know,
basically consistent with what graham 

1008
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:47,190
singh and his book is that,
this,

1009
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:47,450
this,
what we're seeing here,

1010
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:52,451
this episode basically represents a 
curtain that has come down and obscured 

1011
00:51:52,451 --> 00:51:57,190
150,000
or more years of deep human history and 

1012
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,750
basically his last that history to 
modern perception.

1013
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,260
But now once we understand that,
yeah,

1014
00:52:03,261 --> 00:52:08,261
you know what the uniformitarians were 
wrong to reject all ideas of 

1015
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:09,680
catastrophism,
you know,

1016
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:13,100
because in the original,
in the early days of geology,

1017
00:52:13,101 --> 00:52:15,470
the,
the founding fathers of geology,

1018
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,580
we're catastrophists.
They went out in the field unencumbered,

1019
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:24,260
unencumbered,
unencumbered by dogmas and doctrines.

1020
00:52:24,261 --> 00:52:27,380
And so forth,
they looked at the evidence in the field

1021
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:30,500
and concluded that there had been 
catastrophic episodes.

1022
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,820
And this is a baron von qva,
sedgwick murchison,

1023
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:39,821
if you'd go back and you're all of these
guys who basically are considered the 

1024
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:42,590
godfathers of modern geology,
they were to a man catastrophist,

1025
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,650
uh,
james hutton,

1026
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,160
lyle and play fair came along and 
basically proposed the idea of 

1027
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,670
uniformitarianism.

1028
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,450
The present is the key to the past.
Very powerful.

1029
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,460
A working idea is that we can look at 
stuff that's going on today,

1030
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:06,580
extrapolate backwards and try to figure 
out things that happened in the past 

1031
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,060
when we don't have an eyewitness 
account.

1032
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:10,160
Right?
Very powerful.

1033
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:15,161
But what,
what happened was it became so 

1034
00:53:15,161 --> 00:53:17,861
entrenched as dogma that anybody who 
invoked catastrophes was considered,

1035
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,330
um,
basically fringe.

1036
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:24,140
Because in the early days,
some of these guys like sedgwick,

1037
00:53:24,141 --> 00:53:25,710
for example,
he was a theologian.

1038
00:53:25,711 --> 00:53:30,711
He was a traveling minister who went 
around and in his travels to convert 

1039
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:32,470
that,
the people to,

1040
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:36,150
to christianity,
he would see the stuff and he would,

1041
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:41,510
you know,
place it within the context perhaps of 

1042
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:41,520
being noah's flood,
right?

1043
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:44,310
And they would place it in some of,
not all of them,

1044
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:47,250
some of them would place it in a,
in a biblical context.

1045
00:53:47,251 --> 00:53:50,490
Right?
So when they were attacked,

1046
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,970
basically the,
the substance of the attack was,

1047
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:59,330
well you guys are trying to bring us 
back to the days of biblical literalism 

1048
00:53:59,330 --> 00:53:59,330
in sciences.

1049
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:00,780
Moved beyond that.
We're not here,

1050
00:54:00,781 --> 00:54:04,140
we don't want to talk about catastrophes
or great floods.

1051
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:06,540
Dahlias weren't.
We're through talking about all of that.

1052
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,500
That's all been discredited.
And what you see is between the early 18

1053
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:14,790
hundreds with the beginning of geology,
earth science too,

1054
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:17,700
about the 19th century,
what you see as a steady decline,

1055
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,010
you know,
some of the older guys die off,

1056
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:25,011
they're replaced by the new guys who 
have now basically taken control of the 

1057
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:28,881
university curriculums.
And they been indoctrinated into this 

1058
00:54:28,881 --> 00:54:32,211
idea of a strict gradUalism.
And at any deviation from that strict 

1059
00:54:32,211 --> 00:54:34,650
gradualism is,
is a heresy basically.

1060
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,470
So by the time we get to the 20th 
century,

1061
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:42,560
you had this raining uniformity,
raining gradualists dogma that had been 

1062
00:54:43,051 --> 00:54:48,051
imposed upon all earth science.
And anybody who deviated from that was 

1063
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:52,311
immediately kicked out of the club.
And this is why when jay harlan brett's 

1064
00:54:52,311 --> 00:54:56,930
came along in the 19 twenties and 
proposed that there had been these 

1065
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:57,060
gigantic floods in the pacific 
northwest,

1066
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:01,120
you know,
the geological community basically said,

1067
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:02,130
get outta here.

1068
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:07,160
We don't want to hear aBout it.
We know that that couldn't have been 

1069
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,970
just because we know jay harlan brett's 
continued to document,

1070
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,620
exhaustively document from the field 
that,

1071
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:18,180
that these floods were very real.
His critics said,

1072
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:19,050
well,
you don't,

1073
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,120
you can't provide a source for these 
floods.

1074
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,980
Therefore they didn't happen.
Now,

1075
00:55:22,981 --> 00:55:27,981
bear in mind that all of his critics is 
his most vocal critics had never even 

1076
00:55:27,981 --> 00:55:32,631
gone out to actually look right.
And a gram is going to hit.

1077
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:36,890
It's got a great section in his new 
upcoming book describing the,

1078
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,040
the ordeal that brett's was put through.
But he finally prevailed of ultimately,

1079
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:44,010
um,
most of his critics died off,

1080
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:45,420
you know,
he outlived and he lived to be,

1081
00:55:45,421 --> 00:55:48,030
I think 98.
So I think when he was 96,

1082
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:53,031
he was given the penrose metal,
which is the highest honor of geology 

1083
00:55:53,031 --> 00:55:54,450
and the only,
he said he was very grateful,

1084
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:58,240
but the only thing he he was unhappy 
about was the fact that he,

1085
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,790
all of his critics had died off.

1086
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:02,060
So he didn't get to gloat over.
So.

1087
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:03,570
But,
um,

1088
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:08,070
but so What happened was you had the 
younger geologists come in who are,

1089
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:10,860
who are more open to that in,
in what you see is between the fifth,

1090
00:56:10,861 --> 00:56:12,600
19,
15 and 19 sixties.

1091
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,030
You have a transition going on where 
we're,

1092
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:19,140
where they're beginning to accept that 
these great floods that happened.

1093
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:23,040
But,
but what they did was they took a modern

1094
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:27,040
example,
which is glacial outburst floods,

1095
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:32,310
which we've witnessed dozens and dozens,
probably hundreds of suitcases in 

1096
00:56:32,441 --> 00:56:34,660
Iceland,
particularly Alaska,

1097
00:56:34,661 --> 00:56:39,661
british columbia of the himalayas where 
you have particularly going back to the 

1098
00:56:39,661 --> 00:56:42,310
little ice age.
When the glaciers began to recede in the

1099
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:47,311
mid 19th century,
you had a lot of what are called pro 

1100
00:56:47,311 --> 00:56:50,070
glacial lakes formed or lakes bodies of 
water held in by the melting ice.

1101
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:53,860
And then eventually the ice gave way 
into the water,

1102
00:56:53,861 --> 00:56:55,540
rushed out in the form of a flood.

1103
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,570
The icelanders call it a yoke elopes.
Okay,

1104
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:03,900
so we have a modern example.
So what they did was in the sixties and 

1105
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,320
seventies was they said,
okay,

1106
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:10,380
guess what?
We've got now evidence that there was a 

1107
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,200
huge body of water,
huge lake in western Montana,

1108
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,680
and it was held in by an ice dam.
That ice dam gave way all of this water 

1109
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,140
gushed out over Idaho and in 
southeastern Washington down to columbia

1110
00:57:20,141 --> 00:57:23,190
gorge to the pacific ocean,
and caused all of these,

1111
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:28,260
this amazing erosion and sedimentation 
that harland brett's was documenting.

1112
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,170
Never mind that we have to extrapolate 
up three orders of magnitude from modern

1113
00:57:35,171 --> 00:57:36,550
examples,
right?

1114
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:41,610
Nevermind,
that the modern examples are utterly 

1115
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:42,040
minuscule compared to what brett's was 
looking at.

1116
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:47,460
That has become the dogma to explain 
these floods and it's still the 

1117
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:52,710
entrenched dogma as we speak.
Now I am trying to demolish that dogma.

1118
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:57,840
I want to show that these floods were 
something much grander than they have 

1119
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:03,061
even imagined,
and that the source of him was not 

1120
00:58:03,061 --> 00:58:03,880
actually a big glacial lake,
but was,

1121
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:08,940
was what brett's originally originally 
theorized was that there was something 

1122
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,820
that caused a rapid melting of the ice.
But then his critics said,

1123
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:17,821
well,
there's nothing that could melt the ice 

1124
00:58:17,821 --> 00:58:17,821
as fast as you're requiring for your 
floods.

1125
00:58:17,821 --> 00:58:19,180
So again,
your floods didn't happen,

1126
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:24,690
but his floods did happen and they were 
on an enormous inconceivably vast scale.

1127
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:30,420
And this is what I was taking him out to
see firsthand because I felt like for 

1128
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:34,420
him to,
to really have a handle on this,

1129
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:36,530
uh,
this information and this,

1130
00:58:36,531 --> 00:58:41,531
this insight into the catastrophes that,
that basically would have terminated his

1131
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:47,010
mother civilization as he called it,
that he should see this stuff in the 

1132
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:47,010
field for himself.

1133
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:47,420
Because,
you know,

1134
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,260
as they say,
a picture's worth a thousand words.

1135
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:55,410
We're going out in the field and 
experiencing this directly is worth a 

1136
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:55,410
thousand pictures.
And,

1137
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:58,270
and so he's going to incorporate that 
into his,

1138
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,060
into his book.
And I would like to say about that book,

1139
00:59:01,061 --> 00:59:06,061
that that,
based upon what I know and what you've 

1140
00:59:06,061 --> 00:59:08,180
shown me,
a bit of what's going into the book I'll

1141
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:12,580
I'll proclaim without any equivocation 
that I think is probably going to be the

1142
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:17,581
most important book that's come out in a
21st century because it's opening a 

1143
00:59:17,581 --> 00:59:21,811
window onto this story,
like no other single source of 

1144
00:59:21,811 --> 00:59:22,280
information.
CredIble information.

1145
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,840
Wow,
that's a big.

1146
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,140
It's a big statement.
This,

1147
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,160
this whole thing is so mind blowing and 
as mind blowing as your first 

1148
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,640
appearances.
This chart especially is really freaking

1149
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:33,320
me out.
Like looking at the mortality,

1150
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:35,690
all the animals,
the mass extinction event that must have

1151
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:36,410
taken place.

1152
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:42,010
One of the things that always bothered 
me about that idea that human beIngs 

1153
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:45,041
killed off the wooly mammoths is that 
they found these vast fields of uneaten 

1154
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:50,081
mammoths where there was thousands of 
them that had died almost 

1155
00:59:50,081 --> 00:59:51,320
instantaneously,
which is just.

1156
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,210
That doesn't make any sense.
Like what did they do?

1157
00:59:53,211 --> 00:59:58,211
They went on a mass killing orgy of 
slaughter and then just decided not to 

1158
00:59:58,851 --> 01:00:00,590
eat any of them.
Well,

1159
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:05,650
you know,
the field evidence itself is 

1160
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:05,650
inconsistent with that idea right here.
This is an example.

1161
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:10,541
This is one of the many mammoth 
cemeteries and and what happens is that 

1162
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,610
you can see here that you can see from 
the shoreline seated,

1163
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,540
there was a flood,
the river rose up to this level,

1164
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,960
and then when it rolls down,
it left this in its wake.

1165
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:26,290
And what you see here like this is bone 
counting at the barrel mammoth cemetery 

1166
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,530
in northern yakutia siberia.

1167
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:33,100
Identical deposits are found throughout 
the tamer peninsula in what we see here 

1168
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:37,390
is these massive bone deposits that have
been showing up for the last couple of 

1169
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:42,041
hundred years.
Every time that there's a thawing or a 

1170
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:45,710
flood or these things are washed up on 
the shore of the arctic ocean.

1171
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,960
You know what we see is that there were 
huge,

1172
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:53,020
huge herds of wooly mammoths grazing.
We're now the plant material is only two

1173
01:00:55,071 --> 01:00:58,700
inches high.
So clearly it was a completely different

1174
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:00,200
climate there.
You know,

1175
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,190
what's interesting is that you,
you had in siberia able to support herds

1176
01:01:04,191 --> 01:01:09,191
of wooly mammoths at the same time that 
half of north America is buried under 

1177
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:13,790
two miles or more advice.
How is that possible?

1178
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:16,790
Just a totally different atmosphere.
Still puzzling over that.

1179
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:21,820
I have some ideas,
but until I can test these ideas a 

1180
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:21,820
little further.
Um,

1181
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:26,470
so without an ice core samples,
is it impossible to figure out what the 

1182
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:28,870
temperature was in siberia at that time?
No,

1183
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:33,900
no.
They configure out basically based upon 

1184
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,191
fossil plant remains.
And you can see that in some cases the 

1185
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:38,210
tree line was hundreds of miles further 
north than it is now.

1186
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:40,400
An ex.
Clearly if you've got trees,

1187
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:45,200
forests growing now were 13 or 14 or 
15,000

1188
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,490
years ago.
It was permafrost,

1189
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:48,830
you know,
it was warmer clearly.

1190
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,610
So there's still.
Whoa.

1191
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,880
What does that 19th century scene 
showing every floor of the london docks 

1192
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,480
covered by thousands of mammoth tusks 
from siberia.

1193
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:03,710
This is a drawing obviously,
pre dates,

1194
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:05,000
photographs,
yeah.

1195
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:10,070
For hundreds of years,
thousands of mammas in tombed,

1196
01:02:10,071 --> 01:02:14,750
mammoth and mammoth tusks were being 
zoomed from the siberian permafrost.

1197
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:18,020
Thousands and thousands and thousands of
these.

1198
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,370
And,
and basically

1199
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:21,990
to me,
you look at this,

1200
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:26,970
this is just in your face evidence that 
this was not humans doing this,

1201
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,170
you know,
it was not humans that were,

1202
01:02:29,171 --> 01:02:33,450
were slaughtering these mammas and 
burying near remains it,

1203
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:36,120
it the instantaneous nature would 
almost.

1204
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:39,120
It would almost be like people have 
figured out some new thing,

1205
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:42,120
like they figured out some,
some like,

1206
01:02:42,121 --> 01:02:43,530
uh,
a doom gun,

1207
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:47,010
you know,
where they shot the whole,

1208
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:49,280
the doom got well,
look at,

1209
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:51,720
look at the near extinction of american 
bison.

1210
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:56,520
What brought that about trains and high 
powered rifles,

1211
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:59,190
right?
It was a technological major,

1212
01:02:59,191 --> 01:03:03,990
technological advancement that was able 
to bring about the near extermination of

1213
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:06,210
the american,
especially a guy that I'm going to bring

1214
01:03:06,211 --> 01:03:09,300
on the podcast soon to discuss that.
As name's dan flores,

1215
01:03:09,301 --> 01:03:14,301
who spent a big chunk of his 
intellectual career studying this.

1216
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:20,420
And what he believes is that the bison 
had a massive population jump that was 

1217
01:03:22,861 --> 01:03:26,550
directly correlating to smallpox 
epidemic.

1218
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:30,900
The native american people and that when
the United States,

1219
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:36,590
when we look at the United States 
history in the big stacks of woolly 

1220
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:36,590
mammoths,
or excuse me,

1221
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:41,301
the big stacks of bison skulls,
we always look to like that was a very 

1222
01:03:41,301 --> 01:03:45,681
unusual population of bison that existed
because the plains indians had 

1223
01:03:45,961 --> 01:03:50,961
experienced this massive extinction 
event and then when they had 

1224
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:53,310
incorporated the horse like the horse 
and the.

1225
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:58,520
Apparently the american indians,
native americans rather were on their 

1226
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,960
way to extra padding the bison even 
before we came along.

1227
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:06,170
But then they died off in this massive 
death scenario with small pox and all 

1228
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:11,640
the different diseases that the 
europeans had brought over here.

1229
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,730
And then the mammoth population,
or excuse me,

1230
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:18,240
the bison population had grown like 
almost unnaturally.

1231
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:23,241
It'd been much larger than it ever been 
in the past and that's when the United 

1232
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:28,910
States was established and that's when 
all the western european immigrants had 

1233
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:31,830
come along and started killing off all 
these bisons.

1234
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:35,700
It's really a very interesting subject 
and it's an interesting idea.

1235
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:39,120
It's plausible.
I haven't looked into that.

1236
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,140
You know,
I,

1237
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:43,500
I just assumed,
and maybe maybe wrongfully,

1238
01:04:43,501 --> 01:04:47,700
but I had assumed that the bison 
population had been relatively stable.

1239
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,170
I am not convinced though,
that,

1240
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:55,680
that there was this massive die off of 
the native american population yet I'm 

1241
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,940
not convinced maybe,
well,

1242
01:04:56,941 --> 01:04:58,580
because I haven't looked into it yet,
but,

1243
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:03,810
but you know,
one of the things I've seen is that the 

1244
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,681
assumption there is predicated upon the 
europeans arrived and brought the 

1245
01:05:06,681 --> 01:05:06,681
diseases that,
that,

1246
01:05:06,681 --> 01:05:10,900
uh,
that native americans had no defenses 

1247
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:10,900
for.
But the thing is,

1248
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:11,250
is that,
you know,

1249
01:05:11,251 --> 01:05:16,251
there's so much evidence now showing 
that there were lots of explorers in 

1250
01:05:17,531 --> 01:05:18,130
immigrants

1251
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:22,090
to the new world prior to the arrival of
the europeans.

1252
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:24,040
You know,
the chinese,

1253
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:29,041
the phoenicians.
And I'm not necessarily saying that's 

1254
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:31,260
credible that none of it's been proven.
But there's some interesting data out 

1255
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,640
there that suggests in there a number of
books written that again,

1256
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:38,641
I haven't accessed it.
So I'm not gonna sit here and pretend 

1257
01:05:38,641 --> 01:05:38,890
that I'm an authority on that because 
I'm not.

1258
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,920
But,
but if some of that turns out to be 

1259
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,991
credible,
it would suggest that there was a lot 

1260
01:05:45,991 --> 01:05:48,481
more interaction between the native 
american population and other groups 

1261
01:05:48,481 --> 01:05:49,120
around the world,
which,

1262
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:54,180
if true to me kind of somewhat 
undermines this idea that they were,

1263
01:05:55,890 --> 01:06:00,890
you know,
completely susceptible to the 

1264
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:01,250
introduction of these,
you know,

1265
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,550
to these foreign diseases.
But again,

1266
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,560
I will,
I've got an open mind.

1267
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:07,360
I'll wait and see.
I'd like to see what his,

1268
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,340
what he says,
I'd like to hear his,

1269
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:10,260
his,
uh,

1270
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:11,570
his idea

1271
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,760
for anyone interested in.
He has a paper in the journal of 

1272
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,091
american history.
It's called bison ecology and bison 

1273
01:06:20,091 --> 01:06:23,961
diplomacy.
The southern plains from 1800 to 1850.

1274
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:26,610
Um,
I just looked for it online.

1275
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,920
You can,
there's a preview that's available,

1276
01:06:28,921 --> 01:06:31,650
but to download the entire paper or 
book,

1277
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:34,350
I'm not sure which one it is.
It's $19.

1278
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:39,650
And what's,
what journal is it in the journal of 

1279
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:41,850
american history from september of 
[inaudible] 91.

1280
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,600
And like I said,
he's working on a new book right now and

1281
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:47,280
uh,
I'm trying to get them to come in,

1282
01:06:47,281 --> 01:06:52,281
but it's just,
it's very difficult while he's in the 

1283
01:06:52,281 --> 01:06:52,281
middle of a,
you said september of 1991.

1284
01:06:52,281 --> 01:06:52,710
Yeah.
Yeah,

1285
01:06:52,711 --> 01:06:55,920
I can probably access dan flores is his 
name.

1286
01:06:55,980 --> 01:07:00,980
And uh,
well just the information that I got 

1287
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:03,090
about it was pretty mind blowing,
but a sounds interesting.

1288
01:07:03,091 --> 01:07:06,300
I want to know more.
Thank you for that.

1289
01:07:06,301 --> 01:07:07,050
Joe,
please.

1290
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:12,530
Now let's,
let's go back to that photo that you 

1291
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:13,410
have on your desktop that you were going
to explain to me,

1292
01:07:13,411 --> 01:07:18,411
but we decided not to talk about it 
before the podcast because it's so 

1293
01:07:18,411 --> 01:07:22,371
incredible that you said this.
All this incredible change that we're 

1294
01:07:23,521 --> 01:07:24,940
looking at the,
the,

1295
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:29,941
the geological structure,
all that took place within just a week.

1296
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:33,050
Yeah.
Let's go to.

1297
01:07:33,051 --> 01:07:33,950
This will,
will come.

1298
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:38,810
I've got that world will come to that.
This is a,

1299
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:43,040
this is a satellite photograph taken 
from about 500 miles up.

1300
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:46,100
And what you see here,
this is southeastern Washington,

1301
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:51,580
and what you're looking at here is part 
of what's called the columbia basalt 

1302
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,290
plateau.
This is part of the terrain that,

1303
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:59,430
that we crossed when I was with graham.
What you see here is that you have an 

1304
01:07:59,481 --> 01:08:01,790
area of,
if you look here,

1305
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:02,950
you can see the,
um,

1306
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:08,530
oh,
differentiate between the pixels in the 

1307
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:12,281
actual squares that like,
you see this red area down here is area 

1308
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:15,980
that's actually being farmed and it's an
in because this is an photograph.

1309
01:08:15,981 --> 01:08:20,981
And so what happens is,
is that the areas that are being 

1310
01:08:20,981 --> 01:08:22,580
cultivated will show up warmer than the 
surrounding areas.

1311
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:28,060
this is,
this whole plateau is covered in this 

1312
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:30,191
stuff called los l o e s s,
and it's a type of very fertile soil 

1313
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:34,820
that has a rather mysterious and 
controversial origin.

1314
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:37,010
We'll get into that right now,
but in some places,

1315
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:39,110
this last layer is hundreds of feet 
thIck,

1316
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:43,580
over a dark basalt bedrock that is the 
result of,

1317
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:47,240
of these massive outflows of basaltic 
lava,

1318
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,600
uh,
that,

1319
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:53,660
that came out,
did extruded between about $6 million 

1320
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:54,590
and 16 million years ago.
Right.

1321
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:57,260
The,
the hotspot,

1322
01:08:57,261 --> 01:09:02,261
that was the ultimate origin of this 
basalt is now we're yellowstone is 

1323
01:09:02,261 --> 01:09:03,620
which,
so you can make that connection near the

1324
01:09:03,621 --> 01:09:06,530
yellowstone super volcano.
Super volcano.

1325
01:09:06,531 --> 01:09:07,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

1326
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:08,020
In,
in,

1327
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:13,350
um,
but what you have here is that you have 

1328
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:17,591
the lighter areas is where this lust 
topsoil still exists and the darker 

1329
01:09:17,591 --> 01:09:18,420
areas is where the,
the,

1330
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:23,480
the underlying dark basalt has been,
is showing through because the loss was 

1331
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,350
washed away.
So what this is,

1332
01:09:25,351 --> 01:09:26,660
is,
is your typical,

1333
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:31,850
the geological term is and nasda 
moseying and basically that means a 

1334
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:36,011
branching flow pattern of the water and 
you can see that very clearly here that 

1335
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:42,011
the water came off of this river,
which is the columbia river up here and 

1336
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:46,271
float over the landscape and washed away
the basalt and left these gigantic 

1337
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:50,660
channels in its wake and there's more 
over here to the,

1338
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:53,060
to the east and there's more over here 
to the west.

1339
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,550
Um,
and if we look at actually this,

1340
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:04,390
let me go to a different program here.
I think that will actually have some 

1341
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:09,800
that actually I think has the picture in
it that you were seeing.

1342
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:13,730
Now what we're looking at here is what's
been called the missoula flood,

1343
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:15,830
right?
Named after the town of missoula,

1344
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:20,831
Montana.
Missoula is in a basin that was part of 

1345
01:10:20,831 --> 01:10:24,581
this hypothesized giant lake that that 
presumably caused this flood.

1346
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,690
Right.
And again,

1347
01:10:26,691 --> 01:10:29,330
there was an ice dam that there was this
ice dam,

1348
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,480
the ice dam broke and as soon as this 
thing comes up,

1349
01:10:32,481 --> 01:10:35,510
I will be able to show you some slides.
Here we go.

1350
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:37,970
Let's see.
here we go.

1351
01:10:37,971 --> 01:10:41,900
It's becoming operate here.
While that's coming up,

1352
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:45,920
we'll look at this slide right here 
because this will kind of give you a,

1353
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:51,530
a picture of the earth as it was during 
the height of the ice age.

1354
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,190
So wow,
that's pretty deep.

1355
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,910
The sheets of ice go pretty far down.
That's amazing.

1356
01:11:01,911 --> 01:11:04,220
Canada didn't exist.
Candidate in exist.

1357
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,750
Wow.
Yeah.

1358
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,900
Poor canadians.
Well yeah.

1359
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,390
And you know,
and you know,

1360
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:13,440
the ice part of it is,
you know,

1361
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:18,441
a lot of that in the midwest now.
A lot of the farming belt of America is 

1362
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:23,361
basically growing out of the fertile 
soil that the ice scraped off of Canada 

1363
01:11:23,361 --> 01:11:27,210
and dumped down in Minnesota and Iowa 
and Wisconsin and so on.

1364
01:11:27,211 --> 01:11:28,470
So,
um,

1365
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:30,660
you know,
some day they may want that back,

1366
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:36,170
but we're not going to let him have it.
It's fascinating when you look at that,

1367
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:40,290
that there was this big ice cap,
but then the areas around it,

1368
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,500
no ice and why,
why was that?

1369
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,050
Well,
that's one of the mysteries,

1370
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:51,170
again,
like over here in siberia can see over 

1371
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:53,841
here,
this is where all the woolly mammoths 

1372
01:11:53,841 --> 01:11:53,841
were.

1373
01:11:53,841 --> 01:11:56,270
Giant herds of bully mammoths and it 
appears lIke it may have been warmer 

1374
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:59,490
than now during the ice age,
which is very odd.

1375
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,860
There's some ice up there.
Is that what we're seeing?

1376
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:03,210
Yeah,
there's some ice up there.

1377
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:09,050
Sporadic glaciers,
but nothing like what we see in 

1378
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:10,830
northwestern europe over here.
This was called the pheno scandi and ice

1379
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:15,840
sheet.
And the sheet over north America 

1380
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,920
actually consisted of two ice sheets,
the lauren laurentide,

1381
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,030
which was centered over hudson bay,
and record the aaron,

1382
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:22,080
which was centered over the canadian 
rockies.

1383
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,660
And in this particular slide you can see
a,

1384
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:32,900
you can see here,
this was the core of the aaron over 

1385
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:32,900
here,
over the canadian rockies,

1386
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,400
and this was the law,
the laurentide was much bigger c,

1387
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:39,060
and then there was an area between the 
two right here,

1388
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,090
which has been theorized as a,
at one point,

1389
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:47,091
having been a corridor called the 
icefree corridor in migrants from 

1390
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:52,390
paleoindian.
Migrants from siberia would have come 

1391
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:55,941
across Alaska and down through this 
corridor here to the lower United States

1392
01:12:56,430 --> 01:13:00,300
and ultimately down here to south 
America.

1393
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:05,840
And it was that group,
these groups of bands of paleo indian 

1394
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:10,540
hunters that according to the overkill 
or blitzkrieg hypothesis wiped out the,

1395
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,180
the,
the,

1396
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:14,220
the mega mammals as they,
as they passed by.

1397
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:18,930
It's just.

1398
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:22,920
Let's see.
Okay,

1399
01:13:22,921 --> 01:13:23,880
there we go.
Okay.

1400
01:13:23,881 --> 01:13:26,000
So here,
this will show,

1401
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:30,450
uh,
the coastlines of the,

1402
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:33,750
uh,
of the world during the,

1403
01:13:33,751 --> 01:13:35,280
uh,
during the ice age.

1404
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:40,910
And uh,
let me just escape out of this so that 

1405
01:13:42,661 --> 01:13:46,770
we can zoom in a little bit and look at 
it closer.

1406
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:51,180
Okay.
So here would be,

1407
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:55,200
as we see now,

1408
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,400
and

1409
01:13:57,610 --> 01:14:00,130
this is modern coastline,
this is modern coastlines.

1410
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,870
And now I'm going to,
I'm going to jump to.

1411
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:07,200
This is actually only 300 feet lower 
than now and quite a bit different.

1412
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:12,280
let's just look at the United States.

1413
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,740
North America.
That's amazinG.

1414
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,210
It was a lot more United States.
Yeah.

1415
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:18,610
Now check this out.
Okay.

1416
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:21,730
Now here,
here's north America city is now,

1417
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,980
and you see up here,
this is what's called,

1418
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:28,870
this is the bering strait right here in 
between Alaska and siberia,

1419
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:33,990
right during the ice age.
This whole area was exposed it because 

1420
01:14:36,401 --> 01:14:41,401
of the lowered sea level.
And we'll go one slide further and you 

1421
01:14:41,401 --> 01:14:41,401
will see.
Take a look.

1422
01:14:41,401 --> 01:14:41,401
Now,
watch what happens up there.

1423
01:14:41,401 --> 01:14:43,840
And Bahrain jia.
Boom.

1424
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,370
Wow.
So it's all land.

1425
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,550
It's all land and it's connecting north 
America to siberia.

1426
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:50,920
And that's all drowned.
Last didn't understand that.

1427
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:55,921
See,
I always thought that the bering strait 

1428
01:14:55,921 --> 01:14:55,921
was an ice mass that thought it was 
during the ice age,

1429
01:14:55,921 --> 01:14:59,020
that there was some sort of us that it 
was ice,

1430
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:00,130
but it's not.
It's land.

1431
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:01,330
It's land.
wow.

1432
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:03,040
and it's not glaciated.

1433
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:08,460
And it was home to these extraordinary 
herds of mega mammals that ranged over 

1434
01:15:10,451 --> 01:15:12,580
these thousands and thousands of square 
miles.

1435
01:15:12,581 --> 01:15:15,190
I mean the drowned areas bigger than 
modern Alaska.

1436
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,140
So how,
how long ago was this?

1437
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,140
When this is,
you know,

1438
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:20,170
right at the end,
up until the end of the ice age,

1439
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:21,880
you know,
between like 14,

1440
01:15:21,881 --> 01:15:23,120
15,000
years ago,

1441
01:15:23,121 --> 01:15:24,010
14,
50,000

1442
01:15:24,011 --> 01:15:25,780
years ago.
Know glacIers in this area.

1443
01:15:25,781 --> 01:15:30,781
This is all just land and there's 
animals living in it and people are 

1444
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:30,781
walking back and forth is.
I mean,

1445
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:33,640
essentially it was a continent.
I mean it was connected.

1446
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:36,070
There was all one continent.
It was all one.

1447
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:38,320
It was all one continent.
Wow.

1448
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:43,000
That's amazing.
And the coastlines of the world.

1449
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:45,320
Look at Florida down here.
See,

1450
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,070
it's douBle the width of the modern 
peninsula.

1451
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:53,250
Yeah,
it's enormous and it's so close to 

1452
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:54,100
Mexico too.
It's almost like a little boat ride.

1453
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:57,450
Now,
here is Indonesia and you know,

1454
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:59,050
we're,
we're stories,

1455
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:00,610
which I don't know how credible they 
are,

1456
01:16:00,611 --> 01:16:05,611
but you know,
there are stories like memoria and the 

1457
01:16:05,611 --> 01:16:05,611
pacific and all of them.

1458
01:16:05,611 --> 01:16:05,611
again,
I don't know,

1459
01:16:05,611 --> 01:16:06,040
a credible.
Those are.

1460
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:08,740
I think the atlanta story actually has a
little more credibility.

1461
01:16:08,741 --> 01:16:13,741
We talked about that last time somewhat,
but here's the modern and you can see 

1462
01:16:13,741 --> 01:16:13,741
the light.
Blue is the,

1463
01:16:13,741 --> 01:16:17,620
is the coastal shelf area right now.
Let's go back drop.

1464
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:22,621
We're going to drop sea level 300 feet 
and then you'll see here the enormous 

1465
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:23,830
change.
Whoa.

1466
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:29,010
So again,
enormous areas of land were drowned by 

1467
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:30,820
the rising sea levels.
Remember this now,

1468
01:16:30,821 --> 01:16:34,120
when we look at the rise of modern 
cities and modern civilizations,

1469
01:16:34,121 --> 01:16:37,060
where did they first show up?
We're going to coast to coast,

1470
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:39,480
right at the mouths of rivers,
on the coastlines,

1471
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:43,450
and in during the ice age,
where would have been the most obvious?

1472
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:48,810
Prime,
habitable real estate down close to sea 

1473
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:48,810
level,
right?

1474
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:50,590
So if there were cities built,
you know,

1475
01:16:50,591 --> 01:16:53,140
if they were thriving communities during
the ice age,

1476
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:58,141
there are now 400 feet under the water.
It's so amazing that all of these 

1477
01:16:58,141 --> 01:17:01,780
stories of floods,
the epic of gilgamesh,

1478
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:03,130
noah's ark.
Yeah.

1479
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:08,400
They all have these stories seem to 
really correlate with,

1480
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,190
with all this data.

1481
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,350
I mean,
they all seemed to coincide.

1482
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:15,710
That's exactly the point.
It's so weird.

1483
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:17,390
I,
you know,

1484
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:19,410
most people would think about the story 
of noah's ark.

1485
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:21,800
Oh,
it's just crazy old horse shit,

1486
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:27,130
but it's most likely this.
They're basing it on something that 

1487
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:31,280
happened very rapidly in their area.
Yeah.

1488
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,040
Now,
of course we were most familiar with the

1489
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:35,530
story of noah's ark,
you know,

1490
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:37,310
because of the judeo christian 
tradition.

1491
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:42,340
But there are hundreds,
literally hundreds of stories from all 

1492
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:43,930
over the world that parallels the story 
of noah.

1493
01:17:43,931 --> 01:17:46,740
One yard.
You kaylene thrusts the,

1494
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:51,750
pitched them,
man knew that list goes on and on of 

1495
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:55,481
these culture heroes that somehow had 
for knowledge of this impending 

1496
01:17:55,481 --> 01:17:59,120
disaster.
And we're able To take steps to preserve

1497
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:00,470
themselves,
their family,

1498
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:04,820
some diverse cross section of,
of species.

1499
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:06,680
Um,
which,

1500
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:11,681
and they all have this similarity.
They all parallel now my way of looking 

1501
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:12,890
at it as this.

1502
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:17,890
Okay,
we now know from the hard geological 

1503
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:20,480
record that massive floods have taken 
place on the surface of the earth,

1504
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:25,570
massive floods,
right beyond anything that we have even 

1505
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:27,860
imagined right up until a decade or few 
decades ago.

1506
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:30,680
They're real okay.
On the other hand,

1507
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:34,220
we have stories and myths and legends 
repeatedly.

1508
01:18:34,221 --> 01:18:39,221
It's probably the most ubiquitous of all
the stories that we've inherited from 

1509
01:18:39,221 --> 01:18:43,571
the past is this story of this gigantic 
world destroying flood that occurred 

1510
01:18:43,571 --> 01:18:48,550
right now.
On one hand we have the geological hard 

1511
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:49,880
geological record,
which shows there were giant floods.

1512
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:55,120
Then we have these epIc tales and myths 
from all over the world about giant 

1513
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,440
floods.
Do we now dismissed those flood,

1514
01:18:57,470 --> 01:18:59,240
those,
those stories out of hand and say,

1515
01:18:59,241 --> 01:19:02,000
oh,
that's just superstitious preliterate,

1516
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,550
you know,
pseudoscientific nonsense.

1517
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:07,850
I think we'd be making a big mistake to 
do that.

1518
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:13,360
Now if we accept that those flood 
stories and maybe they have been altered

1519
01:19:14,451 --> 01:19:19,010
through time and through the telling 
represent something real.

1520
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:22,730
What about the other other elements of 
the story,

1521
01:19:22,731 --> 01:19:27,500
the fact that in so many cases there was
somebody that had for knowledge,

1522
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,100
do we dismiss that out of hand as well,
you know,

1523
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:34,640
or where does that come from?
That there was one group of people,

1524
01:19:34,641 --> 01:19:39,641
small group of people that saw this 
thing coming and prepared for it and 

1525
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:43,670
others who basically paid no attention.
Maybe they would just preppers.

1526
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:45,980
Maybe there's the prep for 10,000
years ago.

1527
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:50,981
Preppers have 10,000
years on those tv shows that explains 

1528
01:19:50,981 --> 01:19:50,981
it.
Right?

1529
01:19:50,981 --> 01:19:53,180
The one last slide quick here,
here's,

1530
01:19:53,181 --> 01:19:56,600
here's europe and look at the british 
isles right now.

1531
01:19:56,601 --> 01:20:00,380
We'll drop sea level.
No british isles.

1532
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:02,000
That's incredible.
See,

1533
01:20:02,001 --> 01:20:05,840
that's what I was saying earlier when we
started talking to the world of 15,000

1534
01:20:05,841 --> 01:20:10,530
years ago was so dramatically different 
than our modern world that,

1535
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,430
you know,
it's,

1536
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:15,810
it's almost difficult to conceive until 
you start looking at things like this.

1537
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,360
and this is all during the ice age.
Yes.

1538
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:22,350
And so the melting of the glaciers just 
changed everything.

1539
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:26,070
Every thought process while human beings
were absolutely alive.

1540
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:27,030
So yeah,
absolutely,

1541
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:30,630
absolutely no question.
The human human beings were alive.

1542
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:32,130
Yes.
Okay,

1543
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:35,820
so we'll start looking at some of these 
pictures here.

1544
01:20:35,821 --> 01:20:39,420
This is from western Montana.
You know it says in genesis seven,

1545
01:20:39,421 --> 01:20:44,421
19,
the waters prevailed exceedingly upon 

1546
01:20:44,421 --> 01:20:44,421
the earth and all the high hills 
recovered.

1547
01:20:44,530 --> 01:20:48,690
We want you to take a look.
As you can see many mountains in western

1548
01:20:48,691 --> 01:20:53,691
United States.
If you know what you're looking at that 

1549
01:20:53,691 --> 01:20:54,690
have this on them,
you know what those are,

1550
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:59,750
those horizontal lines they look like,
like where the shore there shoreline 

1551
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:01,830
exactly their shorelines.
That's absolutely what they are.

1552
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:06,860
That's absolutely what they are.
Their shorelines reaching right up to 

1553
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:06,870
the very tops of the hills.
You see,

1554
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:12,140
and basically what you had was you had 
this enormous gush of water filling 

1555
01:21:13,261 --> 01:21:18,261
these mountain valleys almost to the 
mountain peaks and then draining away 

1556
01:21:18,261 --> 01:21:22,550
and as it drained away,
it left the succession of shorelines 

1557
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:26,600
etched into the hillside and all along 
the pathway of the floods,

1558
01:21:30,211 --> 01:21:31,620
we're going to see stuff like this.

1559
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,220
This right?
This was our first stop with graham.

1560
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:39,900
This is a lot to ral falls.
This is that basalt I was talking about.

1561
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:45,050
Look at this stuff.
There's layers of this basalt or that's 

1562
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:45,820
you guys underneath it.
Um,

1563
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:51,220
I don't think in despair.
I think I took this picture about 10 

1564
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:51,220
years ago,
but yeah,

1565
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:52,140
I have pictures of me and graham under 
there.

1566
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:53,340
The,
you're so tiny.

1567
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:56,310
That's so crazy.
It's so big right now.

1568
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:59,550
Here's what you've got to picture joe 
picture.

1569
01:21:59,551 --> 01:22:03,690
You've got this nice gentle valley with 
a nice river,

1570
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:05,270
very pastoral scene.
You know,

1571
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:10,340
trees and stuff.
Probably mamasan herds of animals 

1572
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:15,240
grazing along the side of this peaceful 
river with gentle chatt valley slopes.

1573
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:20,990
Here comes this massive flood and we're 
talking about perhaps a flood wave 800,

1574
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,900
1000 feet hIgh coming through as it 
comes through.

1575
01:22:24,901 --> 01:22:27,600
It's ripping up everything in its path 
and it,

1576
01:22:27,630 --> 01:22:32,630
what it does is it now changes the 
profile of his valley from this gentle 

1577
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:36,060
profile to downcutting 800,
a thousand,

1578
01:22:36,061 --> 01:22:39,390
1200 feet or more into the bedrock.

1579
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:44,570
Right?
So now prior to the passage of this 

1580
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:47,871
giant flood,
you had streams and nice little rivers 

1581
01:22:47,871 --> 01:22:49,350
flowing into the main river,
which in this case was the columbia.

1582
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,650
What happens is after the passage of 
this flood wave,

1583
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:57,450
it sheared off the sides of the channel,
so the now rather than a gentle slope,

1584
01:22:57,451 --> 01:22:58,760
you've got sheer cliffs,
four,

1585
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:00,000
five,
600 feet high.

1586
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:04,890
These pre-flood streams and rivers come 
up and are now waterfalls,

1587
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,360
and that's what we're looking at right 
here in this picture,

1588
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:12,570
if that makes sense to you,
and and you notice how you've got this 

1589
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:16,741
undercutting here,
that undercutting only occurs when you 

1590
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:21,280
have enormous intense turbulence in the 
water doIng this.

1591
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:25,840
You see the water doing this will 
undercut.

1592
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:31,380
See this modern waterfall here had 
nothing to do with the creation of this 

1593
01:23:32,771 --> 01:23:37,771
cliff.
This cliff was cut again probably in a 

1594
01:23:37,771 --> 01:23:40,390
matter of days to weeks by the passage 
of these jargon floods,

1595
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:44,470
and there's dozens of these waterfalls 
that are left.

1596
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,900
They're called and these are called 
hanging valleys.

1597
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:52,410
They can be produced by glaciers,
but they can also be produced by 

1598
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:55,990
enormous intense flood waves.
This is your typical,

1599
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,640
not no appointment,
not typical.

1600
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:00,250
This is called.
This is a bar.

1601
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:04,020
I'm a gravel bar,
but in this case it's a boulder bar.

1602
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:09,030
And if you've ever done any walking 
along a river or a creek or along the 

1603
01:24:09,101 --> 01:24:13,390
beach and you've seen ripples in the 
sand and they're typically,

1604
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:18,830
you know,
if you've got a water that's a foot or 

1605
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:19,210
two feet deep,
you don't have ripples that are maybe an

1606
01:24:19,211 --> 01:24:24,211
inch or two high.
What we're looking at here is a flood 

1607
01:24:24,211 --> 01:24:28,381
bar that's three miles long.
It's up to 250 feet above the modern 

1608
01:24:28,661 --> 01:24:33,661
river.
And the ripples that you can see here 

1609
01:24:33,661 --> 01:24:38,580
are up to 50 feet in height and 350 feet
in wavelength.

1610
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:45,970
This was produced again by gigantic 
flood flows.

1611
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:51,450
And if we look right over here,
that's a three story building you see 

1612
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:51,980
right there for scale.
Um,

1613
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,480
wow.
So this,

1614
01:24:53,481 --> 01:24:55,340
this gives you an idea.
It's,

1615
01:24:55,420 --> 01:25:00,420
it's features like this that are just 
unequivocal in terms of realizing that 

1616
01:25:00,551 --> 01:25:03,280
this is,
this is not pseudoscience.

1617
01:25:03,281 --> 01:25:06,430
This really happened.
And this is,

1618
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:09,220
there's this date back to a very 
specific time.

1619
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,380
Yes to this 13,000
year.

1620
01:25:12,381 --> 01:25:15,220
So everywhere you're seeing thIs,
you've seen a.

1621
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:18,230
Geologically you've seen an ice core as 
you're seeing it in fossils.

1622
01:25:18,430 --> 01:25:19,390
Yes.
Yes.

1623
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,090
Wow,
this is evidence of the big meltdown.

1624
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:24,490
Has anybody ever tried to debate you on 
this stuff?

1625
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:27,880
Uh,
I would certainly welcome debate.

1626
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:30,580
I don't claim to have the final,
final word on this,

1627
01:25:30,581 --> 01:25:31,540
but you know,
here's the thing.

1628
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:34,690
I've,
I've interacted with a lot of geologists

1629
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:37,210
that are studying this professional 
geologists.

1630
01:25:37,211 --> 01:25:42,211
They're studying this.
what I can tell you is that in most 

1631
01:25:42,211 --> 01:25:42,490
cases,
the geologists that are studying it,

1632
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:47,540
it's not something,
it's basically something that you're 

1633
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:47,540
doing in your spare time.

1634
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:48,510
Um,
most of them are engaged,

1635
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:49,390
you know,
either you know,

1636
01:25:49,391 --> 01:25:50,040
in the,
uh,

1637
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:53,920
in energy industry or working for 
government for other purposes.

1638
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:57,640
What you actually will see here though,
when you being to look at the,

1639
01:25:57,641 --> 01:26:02,641
the,
the trend in the evidence is that I 

1640
01:26:02,641 --> 01:26:04,861
think that the geological community is 
moving much closer to a scenario like 

1641
01:26:04,861 --> 01:26:09,401
I'm describing.
And right now there's actually a 

1642
01:26:09,401 --> 01:26:09,401
controversy because,
you know,

1643
01:26:09,401 --> 01:26:12,350
some of the older guard is wanting to 
defend this idea of the old collapse.

1644
01:26:12,351 --> 01:26:16,310
This pro,
this giant lake draining out.

1645
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:18,980
There are a group of canadian geologists
though,

1646
01:26:18,981 --> 01:26:23,981
who are,
who are challenging that under a 

1647
01:26:23,981 --> 01:26:25,040
leadership of a man who may now be 
retired named John Shaw,

1648
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:30,370
who goes back to the 19 eighties and 
began a reinterpretation of a,

1649
01:26:30,561 --> 01:26:33,750
of a very ubiquitous glacial feature 
called [inaudible].

1650
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,040
Um,
and,

1651
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:38,780
and that we're,
I can show you some pictures of him here

1652
01:26:38,781 --> 01:26:39,420
after a bit there.

1653
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:40,670
They're very interesting.
um,

1654
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:45,950
they look like inverted bolt holes and 
it was assumed and are always associated

1655
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:50,270
with the locations of the glaciers and 
the ice sheets.

1656
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:55,630
So it was therefore assume that they 
were somehow created by the glaciers 

1657
01:26:55,630 --> 01:26:59,351
themselves,
but glaciers tend to grind things that 

1658
01:26:59,351 --> 01:27:03,011
they're moving over in level things off 
and scratch them and leave striations.

1659
01:27:03,441 --> 01:27:07,760
And all of this abrasion,
these drum ones are smooth,

1660
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:12,790
streamlined features.
What shaw first proposed back in the 

1661
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:18,520
late eighties was that they had actually
been produced by water flowing massive 

1662
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:20,630
amounts of water flowing under the 
glaciers.

1663
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:23,050
And there's a very similar,
the,

1664
01:27:23,051 --> 01:27:23,340
the,
the,

1665
01:27:23,341 --> 01:27:24,500
the critics said,
well,

1666
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:26,840
where does this water come from?
And he said,

1667
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:27,230
well,
I don'T know.

1668
01:27:27,231 --> 01:27:30,950
It must have been enormous.
SubglacIal lake subglacial reservoirs.

1669
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:32,090
The critics said,
well,

1670
01:27:32,091 --> 01:27:36,980
there's no way that our reservoir is 
huge as your floods would require,

1671
01:27:36,981 --> 01:27:38,330
could have existed under the ice.

1672
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:43,660
Therefore your subglacial floods didn't 
exist and that was the.

1673
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:49,030
To me,
the fatal weakness in his theory was to 

1674
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:51,791
explain where the water came from,
but I think now we can't explain where 

1675
01:27:51,791 --> 01:27:53,990
it came from and you believe it's an 
asteroid impact again,

1676
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:55,410
by default I,
there's,

1677
01:27:55,790 --> 01:27:57,860
we have,
we look at all the possible,

1678
01:27:57,861 --> 01:28:01,160
the cross section of possible 
explanations within the realm of nature.

1679
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:03,620
We can go through and we can eliminate 
this one,

1680
01:28:03,621 --> 01:28:04,460
this one,
this one,

1681
01:28:04,461 --> 01:28:05,180
this one,
this one,

1682
01:28:05,181 --> 01:28:10,181
and what we're left with is one that of 
itself would be fully capable of doing 

1683
01:28:10,181 --> 01:28:12,930
it fully capable and make sense that it 
would happen instantaneous.

1684
01:28:12,931 --> 01:28:14,870
That would make sense.
It would happen instantaneously.

1685
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:16,400
Other sort of thing that would.
Yes.

1686
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:20,630
So is there an impact crater that 
corresponds to this timeline or.

1687
01:28:20,631 --> 01:28:22,850
That's what I'm working on trying to 
find it.

1688
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:24,170
Yeah,
and I think I've.

1689
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:29,690
I think I've got a pretty good idea,
but it's going to take some field 

1690
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:32,020
research and next summer I'm planning to
do some some more field research.

1691
01:28:32,021 --> 01:28:34,850
Is there an idea where it hit a.
Yeah,

1692
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:39,851
I have several ideas.
We don't want to talk about it when 

1693
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:41,900
it's.
When it's time to reveal it.

1694
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,250
Okay.
Let's do it here.

1695
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:44,060
Oh,
I'd love that.

1696
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:45,370
I would love that.
Well,

1697
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:48,410
you,
you've shown several impact craters.

1698
01:28:48,411 --> 01:28:50,090
You showed a bunch last time you were 
here,

1699
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:54,770
the one in Australia that was,
I believe you said 500 years ago.

1700
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:58,610
Yeah,
and of course everybody medically,

1701
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:03,750
it hasn't been proven yet because again,
some of these more recent craters of the

1702
01:29:03,751 --> 01:29:05,190
last 10,000
years,

1703
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:11,240
some of these that have been 
hypothesized are actually on the bottom 

1704
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:14,091
of the ocean.
The trader that I think we talked about 

1705
01:29:14,091 --> 01:29:15,260
on the bottom of the indian ocean,
it's under two miles of seawater,

1706
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:20,270
so until we can actually get back there 
in and do more in depth sampling in 

1707
01:29:20,821 --> 01:29:22,920
examination,
it'll be impossible to prove it,

1708
01:29:22,921 --> 01:29:27,921
but I think that the,
the evidence is stronGly supportive of 

1709
01:29:27,921 --> 01:29:31,620
that possibility that maybe 5,000
years ago there was a significant impact

1710
01:29:31,621 --> 01:29:35,310
into the indian ocean that could have 
caused enormous tsunami waves.

1711
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:37,710
Now,
I actually posted one of the,

1712
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:42,870
uh,
somebody called into queStion some of 

1713
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:45,750
the things I had said in the last 
interview about tsunamis.

1714
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:50,070
And at that the things I was saying 
weren't really tsunami.

1715
01:29:50,071 --> 01:29:55,071
So I actually wrote an elaborate 
response to that which is posted on the 

1716
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:59,400
sacred geometry website where I've gone 
into great detail.

1717
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:04,770
I'm showing that the evidence really in 
the end I think does support the idea 

1718
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:09,270
that there had been enormous tsunamis,
possibly hundreds of feet high,

1719
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:13,410
sweeping over the coastlines of the 
indian ocean probably around 5,000

1720
01:30:13,411 --> 01:30:18,411
years ago.
That could have been the origin of some 

1721
01:30:18,411 --> 01:30:18,411
of the flood myths

1722
01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:23,150
and your timeline where this mass 
extinction event occurred,

1723
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:28,210
where the massive warming occurred.
all of that also coincides with the 

1724
01:30:28,641 --> 01:30:33,200
discovery of this nuclear glass all over
asian europe,

1725
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:39,040
which is somewhere in the when they do 
the core samples of around the same 

1726
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,250
area,
right around $12,000

1727
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:41,660
years ago.
Yes.

1728
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:45,770
We can see here.
We'll go through a second.

1729
01:30:45,771 --> 01:30:48,470
This is some of the research you can 
see.

1730
01:30:48,471 --> 01:30:49,850
This is.
This is very typical,

1731
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,840
the mysterious onset of the younger 
dryas.

1732
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:59,260
Now this is.
This has been the kind of the consensus 

1733
01:30:59,260 --> 01:30:59,260
view is that,
okay,

1734
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:01,100
we don't have an explanation.
The younger dryas remembers.

1735
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:03,320
That's an interval between those two 
spikes,

1736
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:08,500
right where you had the warming than the
snap back to glacial cold and in the 

1737
01:31:08,541 --> 01:31:13,541
warming again,
so that interval in between is the 

1738
01:31:13,541 --> 01:31:15,971
younger dryas.
So here they're saying the mysterious 

1739
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:19,510
onset of the younger dryas,
the 1300 year long younger dryas cold 

1740
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:23,590
reversal,
and you notice the date's twelve 

1741
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:23,590
thousand nine hundred and eleven 
thousand six hundred.

1742
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:25,730
That means calendar years before 
present.

1743
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:29,510
So what they've done is they've 
calibrated this from radio carbon dating

1744
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,820
too,
which is not necessarily going to be the

1745
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:36,080
same as the actual calendar years.
So those dates are very interesting.

1746
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:38,600
Um,
11,000,

1747
01:31:38,601 --> 01:31:41,840
600 years ago,
you may recall from our last interview,

1748
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:45,740
is the date given by plato for the 
subsidence of atlantis.

1749
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:47,090
Eleven thOusand.
I mean,

1750
01:31:47,091 --> 01:31:50,060
he says that atlanta subsided in.
You can.

1751
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:55,120
Anybody can read this if they want to 
pick up timaeus and critias the two 

1752
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:58,670
dialogues that he describes atlantis and
he gives that date 9,000

1753
01:31:58,671 --> 01:32:00,230
years before the

1754
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:04,930
exile of long in Egypt,
which took place in 600 bc roughly.

1755
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:09,130
So six huNdred bc in rough roughly is 
2,600

1756
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:11,050
years ago.
Add that to the 9,000

1757
01:32:11,051 --> 01:32:12,950
years and years.
Your $11,600.

1758
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,390
So now what has happened is 2,500
years ago,

1759
01:32:16,391 --> 01:32:21,391
plato gave a date,
which would seem to suggest that 

1760
01:32:21,391 --> 01:32:21,391
something,
some something.

1761
01:32:21,391 --> 01:32:25,910
A man's happened in the atlantic ocean 
and you had an island complex that sank 

1762
01:32:26,170 --> 01:32:30,310
perhaps from rapid sea level rise.
Now 2,500

1763
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:32,890
years later.
Here's modern science coming up with the

1764
01:32:32,891 --> 01:32:34,240
exact date showing,
hey,

1765
01:32:34,241 --> 01:32:37,930
there was a massive meltwater pulse into
the ocean at that date.

1766
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:43,740
Now at this point,
nobody within mainstream science is 

1767
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:43,740
going,
oh,

1768
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:44,010
well,
see he doesn't mention here.

1769
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:45,700
Oh,
that's the date given by plato.

1770
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:48,070
They don't say that,
but it's.

1771
01:32:48,130 --> 01:32:49,930
It is the case.
That's incredible.

1772
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:51,790
That's so amazing.
Now,

1773
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:55,210
plato,
that he was told that it was all through

1774
01:32:55,211 --> 01:32:55,860
stories.

1775
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:56,410
It was.
Yeah,

1776
01:32:56,411 --> 01:32:58,480
it was handed down soul on,
handed down.

1777
01:32:58,481 --> 01:33:03,481
Let's see if I can remember this.
Through deprived esther pitus to 

1778
01:33:03,481 --> 01:33:03,481
courteous.
The elder critias,

1779
01:33:03,481 --> 01:33:07,420
the elder to courteous.
The younger then critias the younger,

1780
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:12,480
I guess to socrates actually at the 
forum we're plato would have heard it 

1781
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,800
would have been the socratic forum where
it was told,

1782
01:33:14,801 --> 01:33:19,300
so I think there was like three 
generations between salon in plato,

1783
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:24,720
the wise men of the time or the people 
that were in charge of disseminating 

1784
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:26,170
knowledge.
Back then it was such a critical job.

1785
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:27,350
Critical job.
Yes,

1786
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,840
no internet,
no books and,

1787
01:33:28,841 --> 01:33:29,250
and,
and,

1788
01:33:29,251 --> 01:33:31,120
and the,
the whole thing was,

1789
01:33:31,121 --> 01:33:35,080
was that the whole emphasis was on 
transmit.

1790
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:39,700
The oral transmission had to take place 
without not one iota of change.

1791
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:43,180
It had to be transmitted from mouth to 
ear,

1792
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:46,660
unbroken without change,
without alteration,

1793
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:49,030
which has always been the issue with 
human beings.

1794
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:52,680
Hence that telephone game.
You tell someone something,

1795
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:56,010
they tell you something,
but if you start out in,

1796
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:59,170
you know it's going to be the same with 
native americans and the native american

1797
01:33:59,171 --> 01:34:04,171
storytellers have to go through a very 
long arduous term of initiation to show 

1798
01:34:05,441 --> 01:34:08,780
that when they tell the story,
it's going to be exactly like they heard

1799
01:34:08,781 --> 01:34:13,781
it.
That's one of the basis of modern 

1800
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:16,021
freemasonry too.
We need to get that with today's modern 

1801
01:34:16,021 --> 01:34:16,021
gossip.
Yeah,

1802
01:34:16,021 --> 01:34:20,480
we need to nail that,
but let's just run through a quick 

1803
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,921
succession here.
If some of the most recent research 

1804
01:34:22,921 --> 01:34:25,920
shock synthesized hexagonal diamonds in 
younger dryas boundary sediments,

1805
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:31,380
whoa,
now these shocks synthesized hexagonal 

1806
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,610
diamonds only occur.
There's no natural known natural process

1807
01:34:33,611 --> 01:34:38,611
that will produce them except for the 
intense heat and pressures of a cosmic 

1808
01:34:38,611 --> 01:34:40,270
impact.
Whoa.

1809
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,670
Okay.
And what year was this study?

1810
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:44,770
Oh,
this has been very recent.

1811
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:46,960
This is probably within the last 10 
years.

1812
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:50,980
there was some since 2007.
This is probably around 2011.

1813
01:34:51,610 --> 01:34:56,610
There was something that was released 
very recently about micro diamonds and 

1814
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:58,040
micro diamonds correspond summer.
Yeah,

1815
01:34:58,041 --> 01:35:03,041
and that also was the same timeline,
so it's just like the evidence keeps 

1816
01:35:03,041 --> 01:35:04,550
accumulating in this time period that 
something hit us.

1817
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:10,000
The micro diamonds,
the nuclear glass spikes in warming.

1818
01:35:10,611 --> 01:35:15,611
That's observable on the ice core 
correlates that mass extinction events 

1819
01:35:15,611 --> 01:35:17,090
of all these animals.
This is an event.

1820
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:18,570
This is an event.
Well,

1821
01:35:18,571 --> 01:35:19,940
I.
This is crazy that you're.

1822
01:35:19,941 --> 01:35:22,820
You're the guy talking about this event.
I mean this is really nuts,

1823
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:28,800
but not anything taken away from you,
but there's so few people beating this 

1824
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:32,330
drum that there's so much information.
We're talking about hard data.

1825
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:38,020
You've shown on this show three,
four different examples of hard data 

1826
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:40,430
that points to this event.

1827
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:42,230
Well see,
here's the thing.

1828
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:47,830
Modern science does tend to get over 
specialized and so what happens is the 

1829
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:50,150
guy looking at extinctions might not be 
looking at,

1830
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:51,620
you know,
glacial melting.

1831
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:54,050
The guy who is looking at glacial 
melting isn't,

1832
01:35:54,210 --> 01:35:57,620
the geologist is not looking at what's 
going on in the sky,

1833
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:00,250
they're not looking at,
you know,

1834
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:05,290
traditions from thousands of years ago.
So what it does is because of the power 

1835
01:36:06,321 --> 01:36:10,700
of this specialization,
specialization is extremely powerful,

1836
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,270
but he's shortcoming is that it's easy 
to miss the big picture.

1837
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:18,770
What that does is opens the door for 
generalists.

1838
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,730
Guys who are just people who are just 
say guys,

1839
01:36:22,731 --> 01:36:25,340
men or women,
anybody who's curious about this stuff,

1840
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:28,220
to look into it and try to see the big 
picture.

1841
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:32,330
Why am I bringing this?
Well it's becAuse for 40 years I've been

1842
01:36:32,331 --> 01:36:37,331
obsessed with this stuff and you know,
I read two or three scientific articles 

1843
01:36:37,331 --> 01:36:40,460
every single day and have done so for 40
years plus.

1844
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:43,570
So that adds up after awhile and I don't
just read them.

1845
01:36:43,571 --> 01:36:45,020
I study,
I might take notes,

1846
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,940
you know,
two or three every single day.

1847
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:49,640
So you figure what is that?
That's 2000 a year.

1848
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:55,120
You go back 40 years.
That's means I probably read something 

1849
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,200
on the order of 40,000
scientific articles from anthropology,

1850
01:36:57,201 --> 01:37:00,230
geology when I studied geology and 
astronomy in college,

1851
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:03,950
so I have some academic background in 
that,

1852
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:05,130
but,
but you know,

1853
01:37:05,210 --> 01:37:10,210
basically what I have done is tried to 
piece together the big picture because 

1854
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:14,390
early on I saw nobody's doing that.
Nobody's doing it really,

1855
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:19,960
and some of the guys that are out there 
doing it are not doing it with academic 

1856
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:20,300
rigor,
you know,

1857
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:25,301
they're bringing in all kinds of weird 
stuff which makes it easy for the 

1858
01:37:25,301 --> 01:37:27,680
critics to attack them and dismiss them 
as fringe science.

1859
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:29,810
The throne,
some wound to the mix.

1860
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:32,480
They're throwing some wound to the mix.
In fact,

1861
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:36,390
one of the,
the,

1862
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:41,790
the rational wiki entry on me says 
something about randall carlson and he 

1863
01:37:41,881 --> 01:37:44,710
is woo and that's all it says.
You know?

1864
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:49,610
So I took that.
And so people love to be able to dismiss

1865
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:51,200
anything that's not mainstream.
Right?

1866
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:52,010
It's outside.
Yeah.

1867
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:54,350
Yeah.
Because there's this cult of authority,

1868
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:55,380
you know,
that's why you're here.

1869
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:56,280
Somebody says,
well,

1870
01:37:56,281 --> 01:37:58,290
what is a real scientists say about 
this?

1871
01:37:58,291 --> 01:38:01,620
What is a real scientists say about this
flood into my current role,

1872
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:04,200
which real scientists,
you know,

1873
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:05,790
vic baker,
richard,

1874
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:06,610
wait,
uh,

1875
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:08,100
you know,
roy breckinridge,

1876
01:38:08,101 --> 01:38:08,600
you know,
I've,

1877
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:13,630
I've read or talk to every,
almost every scientist that's done work 

1878
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:14,440
on the missoula flood,
you know,

1879
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:17,220
so I know what they're saying and what 
they're thinking,

1880
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,690
you know,
and what they've written it.

1881
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:20,000
So,
so,

1882
01:38:20,050 --> 01:38:20,610
you know,
when you say,

1883
01:38:20,611 --> 01:38:22,020
well,
what are the real scientists say?

1884
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:22,680
Well,
okay,

1885
01:38:22,681 --> 01:38:24,900
let's get a little more specific.
Who are you talking about?

1886
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:26,610
Because there are different points of 
view,

1887
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:29,850
you know,
are you talking about John Shaw idea?

1888
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:31,440
Are you talking about,
you know,

1889
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:33,870
victor bakers ideas or,
or,

1890
01:38:33,871 --> 01:38:35,640
or any of the others?
Well,

1891
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:37,350
you know,
and that's the thing,

1892
01:38:37,351 --> 01:38:42,351
they say that because they don't really 
know they've got this idea in your mind 

1893
01:38:42,351 --> 01:38:43,890
that there's this authority that's got 
it all explained,

1894
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:45,840
which makes it easy,
right?

1895
01:38:45,841 --> 01:38:50,841
Because if somebody got it explained,
then we don't need to concern ourselves 

1896
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:50,841
with it or think about it.
Right?

1897
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:53,460
so what I say is,
okay,

1898
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:58,940
forget about who says what.
Let's just look at the facts that the 

1899
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:02,220
facts dictate to us what the meaning of 
all of this is,

1900
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:07,790
you know,
and let's look at all points of view 

1901
01:39:07,790 --> 01:39:07,790
because that's what I try to do.
You know,

1902
01:39:07,790 --> 01:39:09,210
I've got in my,
in my archives here,

1903
01:39:09,211 --> 01:39:09,930
I've got,
you know,

1904
01:39:09,931 --> 01:39:13,910
not only the research that supports the 
idea of a,

1905
01:39:13,970 --> 01:39:16,590
of a cosmic impact back during the 
younger dryas,

1906
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:19,410
but to criticisms of it as well,
you know,

1907
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:20,100
and I go,
okay,

1908
01:39:20,101 --> 01:39:24,240
how can we explain those criticisms and 
into give and take of science.

1909
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:27,140
That's part of the process,
you know,

1910
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:31,140
that's how it evolves because somebody 
puts out a new idea,

1911
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:33,690
you're supposed to attack it,
you know,

1912
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:38,960
and then if it withstands the assault,
the onslaught that shows that it's a 

1913
01:39:39,151 --> 01:39:41,100
credible idea,
you know,

1914
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:42,960
it's like a last man standing sort of 
thing.

1915
01:39:42,961 --> 01:39:46,650
And I think that the cosmic impact 
really is going to end up being the last

1916
01:39:46,651 --> 01:39:47,730
man standing.
Well,

1917
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:50,240
it seems like there's so much evidence 
that you're,

1918
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:52,560
you're,
you're bringing up that's so hard.

1919
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:53,530
You know the,
this,

1920
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,010
the,
the,

1921
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:57,510
how do you say that word?
Hca.

1922
01:39:57,590 --> 01:39:58,950
Contract.
Contract.

1923
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:01,500
Contract like mineral from black,
matte,

1924
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:02,720
I mean all the,
the,

1925
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:04,020
the,
the various things,

1926
01:40:04,021 --> 01:40:06,750
the micro diamonds,
the nuclear glass,

1927
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:11,751
the mass extinction events,
the evidence of uh,

1928
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,530
the loading,
warming,

1929
01:40:13,531 --> 01:40:14,670
the flooding,
the c level,

1930
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:15,390
raw,
all of it.

1931
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:17,520
All,
all this burn area.

1932
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:18,750
Yeah.
And this,

1933
01:40:18,751 --> 01:40:21,510
this is basically st conrad chondrites 
are a type of media,

1934
01:40:21,511 --> 01:40:21,810
right?

1935
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:23,410
So this is saying,
right,

1936
01:40:23,530 --> 01:40:24,900
like material,
in other words,

1937
01:40:24,901 --> 01:40:28,300
material that would have had its origin 
in space from the black man.

1938
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,240
Now this black man is really 
interesting.

1939
01:40:30,241 --> 01:40:33,420
I'm going to show you a couple of slides
of it because this black matte layer,

1940
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:36,240
it's black.
The reason it's black is because it's so

1941
01:40:36,241 --> 01:40:41,190
loaded with what is the result of fire,
right?

1942
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:43,260
So let's,
let's go through here.

1943
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:47,460
This discovery of a nano diamond rich 
layer and the greenland ice sheet.

1944
01:40:47,730 --> 01:40:50,520
So nobody had looked,
but when these guys,

1945
01:40:50,521 --> 01:40:53,100
richard firestone and James West and 
james candidate,

1946
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,100
these other scientists

1947
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:59,100
that are working on this younger dryas 
impact hypothesis said to their 

1948
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:03,451
colleagues,
check out the younger dryas boundary 

1949
01:41:03,451 --> 01:41:06,690
layer 12,000,
900 years ago and see if there's 

1950
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:06,690
anything that shows up there.
They did,

1951
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:08,440
and what do you suppose they found here 
in his right here?

1952
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:13,530
A nano diamond rich layer.
So there it is showing up in the ice 

1953
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:17,911
sheets.
Here's new evidence from a black math 

1954
01:41:17,911 --> 01:41:19,450
site into northern andy's supporting a 
cosmic impact.

1955
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:21,100
Twelve thousand,
800 years ago,

1956
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:27,240
a very high temperature impact melt 
products as evidence for cosmic airburst

1957
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:30,580
impacts 12,900.
So they,

1958
01:41:30,581 --> 01:41:31,180
you know,
they haven't,

1959
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,850
they're getting closer and closer to 
refining the date,

1960
01:41:33,851 --> 01:41:36,910
but it's coming in 12,800
to 12,900

1961
01:41:36,911 --> 01:41:38,320
years ago.
Um,

1962
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,350
wildlife,
wildfire and abrupt ecosystem disruption

1963
01:41:44,351 --> 01:41:48,340
on california's northern channel islands
at the aloe rod.

1964
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,880
Younger dryas boundary at basically 
12,900.

1965
01:41:52,330 --> 01:41:56,860
Twelve point nine k means 12,000,
900 years ago.

1966
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:00,040
It was the universal means a thousand.
It's crazy.

1967
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:05,041
It's all the same.
Everything keeps coming back the same 

1968
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:05,041
date.
Yeah.

1969
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:09,120
Nano diamond rich layer across three 
continents consistent with major cosmic 

1970
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:13,150
impact at 12,800
calendar years before present.

1971
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:17,590
Evidence from central Mexico supporting 
the younger dryas,

1972
01:42:17,650 --> 01:42:22,650
extraterrestrial impact hypothesis,
evidence from northwestern venezuelan,

1973
01:42:23,141 --> 01:42:26,410
andy's for extraterrestrial impact,
the black mat,

1974
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:30,730
enigma evidence for deposition of 10 
million.

1975
01:42:30,731 --> 01:42:33,790
Tons of impact spiros across four 
continents.

1976
01:42:33,791 --> 01:42:35,440
Twelve thousand,
800 years ago.

1977
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:36,640
See,
it's coming in,

1978
01:42:36,670 --> 01:42:41,670
man.
It's coming in and abundance and what's 

1979
01:42:41,670 --> 01:42:42,850
gratifying to me as I theorized this 25 
years ago.

1980
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:48,030
Wow.
And it to see now the hard evidence 

1981
01:42:48,030 --> 01:42:51,631
coming in supporting a scenario I had 
pieced together from all of these 

1982
01:42:51,631 --> 01:42:54,960
different realms of knowledge is very 
gratifying to me.

1983
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,000
What was the seed in your mind that led 
you to be obsessed,

1984
01:43:00,190 --> 01:43:02,830
for lack of a better word,
with this anomaly thing?

1985
01:43:02,831 --> 01:43:04,540
Lack of a better word.
I think it's pretty accurate,

1986
01:43:04,541 --> 01:43:05,500
right?
With this subject.

1987
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,620
Okay.
I guess iT's time to come clean.

1988
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:12,790
I was on mushrooms on top of a mountain.
Well,

1989
01:43:12,791 --> 01:43:14,290
no,
you're actually pretty close.

1990
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:19,030
Okay.
Nineteen 69.

1991
01:43:19,470 --> 01:43:20,840
That's a good year.
Mushrooms.

1992
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:24,610
Well,
wasn't mushrooms but it was something in

1993
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:25,870
the family.
Okay.

1994
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:28,540
Okay.
I'm going to a rock concert.

1995
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,940
Right?
And the beautiful summer day,

1996
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:34,150
early summer 12.
Twelve thousand 900 years ago.

1997
01:43:34,170 --> 01:43:36,940
No,
19,

1998
01:43:36,941 --> 01:43:38,270
69,
right.

1999
01:43:38,770 --> 01:43:40,490
Okay.
So it's.

2000
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:45,630
It's on a field next to a little airport
in just out southwest of the twin 

2001
01:43:46,451 --> 01:43:47,380
cities,
Minnesota,

2002
01:43:47,381 --> 01:43:50,950
which was near where I grew up in the 
Minnesota river.

2003
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,580
Flows through there,
right?

2004
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,030
Minnesota river flows into the 
Mississippi.

2005
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:00,080
I think I'll have some slides coming up 
here.

2006
01:44:00,081 --> 01:44:01,800
I can maybe even show you.
Okay.

2007
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:07,010
So what we have here is that in the 
middle of this thing,

2008
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:12,040
between bands or whatever,
I wandered off from the main area where 

2009
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:15,911
the,
where the crowd was gathered to listen 

2010
01:44:15,911 --> 01:44:18,431
to the music and I walked over to these 
200 foot high bluffs overlooking the 

2011
01:44:18,681 --> 01:44:21,380
valley of the missing of the Minnesota 
river.

2012
01:44:22,010 --> 01:44:27,010
Now the Minnesota river currently flows 
in a little channel at the bottom of 

2013
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:31,601
this valley and I'm standing up on this 
hill and I'm looking down at this 

2014
01:44:31,910 --> 01:44:33,740
Minnesota river,
you know,

2015
01:44:33,741 --> 01:44:38,741
hundreds of feet below me in this 
channel and three miles,

2016
01:44:38,991 --> 01:44:42,890
four miles across.
I see another set of bluffs matching the

2017
01:44:42,891 --> 01:44:46,250
ones that I'm standing on.
And I had this.

2018
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:51,200
All I can say is this was kind of a 
revelation that I'm looking down here at

2019
01:44:51,201 --> 01:44:56,201
this little river flowing into a channel
and then I'm seeing just a gigantic 

2020
01:44:56,271 --> 01:45:01,271
version of that same channel,
but it's three and four miles wide and I

2021
01:45:02,001 --> 01:45:07,001
just looked at that and it was almost as
if for a short period of time I got 

2022
01:45:08,450 --> 01:45:12,200
transplanted out of time or something.
I don't know how to explain it.

2023
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:17,620
You can see this raging river had this 
sense that this whole thing was a 

2024
01:45:18,441 --> 01:45:19,790
gigantic river.

2025
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:24,850
At one time.
I came away from that with this idea 

2026
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:28,520
planted in the back of my brain and it 
bugged me for years after that.

2027
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:31,410
Right,
and it was maybe five,

2028
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:33,560
six years.
This is now into the seventies.

2029
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:38,740
There was not a whole lot on 
catastrophism available in the 

2030
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:38,740
seventies.
There was,

2031
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:39,800
you know,
a manual makowski,

2032
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:42,440
one of the forerunners,
but you know,

2033
01:45:42,441 --> 01:45:47,441
he,
he came up with some really wild ideas 

2034
01:45:47,441 --> 01:45:48,320
that made it very easy for mainstream 
science to dismiss him,

2035
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:52,520
but he came up with some really solid 
ideas to his book.

2036
01:45:52,521 --> 01:45:57,521
Earth and upheaval basically was just a 
documentation of all of this geological 

2037
01:45:57,521 --> 01:45:58,910
evidence for great catastrophes in the 
history of the earth.

2038
01:45:59,690 --> 01:46:02,660
I think he misinterpreted the cause of 
those catastrophes.

2039
01:46:02,661 --> 01:46:07,661
But nonetheless,
when you look at the criticisms you've 

2040
01:46:07,661 --> 01:46:07,661
heard of the manual vela kosky,
right?

2041
01:46:07,661 --> 01:46:08,990
Fellow cops think I've heard it from 
you.

2042
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:10,040
Okay.
Well,

2043
01:46:10,041 --> 01:46:15,041
he was famous bestselling author,
one of the big best selling authors of 

2044
01:46:15,041 --> 01:46:16,010
the 19 fifties,
you know,

2045
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:18,830
maybe in a sense a forerunner of,
in fact,

2046
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:21,950
graham hancock has been compared to vela
koskie now.

2047
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:24,590
And then I've actually seen some of some
of that.

2048
01:46:24,850 --> 01:46:29,850
Um,
although vela [inaudible] work I don't 

2049
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:30,430
think was anywhere near as credible as 
graham's.

2050
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:33,860
Graham is very,
very assiduous in his,

2051
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:38,980
his referencing in his detailing.
And so vela kosky went way off into this

2052
01:46:39,051 --> 01:46:41,910
really weird astrophysics to explain 
his,

2053
01:46:41,970 --> 01:46:46,970
his theories of geological catastrophe,
which again allowed the critics to 

2054
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:48,980
basically dismiss everything he had done
so.

2055
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:50,820
But his book,
earth and upheaval,

2056
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:54,150
I think has upheld the test of time.
We were basically in the 19 fifties.

2057
01:46:54,151 --> 01:46:59,151
He was accumulating all of this evidence
suggesting that there had been 

2058
01:46:59,151 --> 01:47:01,760
catastrophes in earth history and what 
was it,

2059
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,150
like I said,
a best seller,

2060
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:06,960
but the mainstream scientific community 
was very dismissive of it.

2061
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:12,860
Okay.
And then after that you had a book 

2062
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:12,860
called,
uh,

2063
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:17,000
uh,
by charles hapgood called the path of 

2064
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,271
the pole.
I think it came out in [inaudible] 76 

2065
01:47:20,271 --> 01:47:23,270
and he,
he and near theorized that there had 

2066
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:24,110
been a sudden shift that had brought 
about the quick freezing of the mammoths

2067
01:47:24,111 --> 01:47:26,940
and the end of the ice age and so forth.
Um,

2068
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,430
so I was familiar with that stuff and I 
would,

2069
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:32,160
I would read that stuff just out of 
curiosity,

2070
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:33,070
you know,
um,

2071
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:35,670
because that was some of the stuff that 
was out there.

2072
01:47:35,671 --> 01:47:36,850
And,
and um,

2073
01:47:36,940 --> 01:47:37,860
you know,
somebody would say,

2074
01:47:37,861 --> 01:47:39,380
hey,
did you read the lukowski?

2075
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:43,200
And so as I was reading this stuff,
I would keep thinking back to this image

2076
01:47:43,201 --> 01:47:45,340
I'd had of this,
you know.

2077
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:48,300
And then in early eighties I was talking
to somebody,

2078
01:47:48,301 --> 01:47:53,301
I actually gave one of my very early 
lectures on this stuff and there was 

2079
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:54,360
somebody who had a degree in geology who
stood up and he said,

2080
01:47:54,870 --> 01:47:55,260
no,
no,

2081
01:47:55,261 --> 01:47:55,530
no,
no,

2082
01:47:55,531 --> 01:47:57,930
that,
that valley that you're talking about,

2083
01:47:57,931 --> 01:47:59,730
which created over millions of years.

2084
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:01,500
I said,
I don't think so.

2085
01:48:02,010 --> 01:48:04,110
And we kind of got into it a little bit 
in,

2086
01:48:04,111 --> 01:48:06,120
but what that did was it kind of pissed 
me off.

2087
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:07,200
And I said,
okay,

2088
01:48:07,201 --> 01:48:10,260
I'm going to research this thoroughly.
And I did.

2089
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:15,290
I thoroughly researched it.
I went and I found every single thing 

2090
01:48:15,290 --> 01:48:18,591
that had been written on it and 
discovered that there's actually 

2091
01:48:18,591 --> 01:48:18,591
mainstream geologists that have said,
yeah,

2092
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:24,080
that river channel,
that giant river channel was actually 

2093
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:27,150
created by a huge meltwater flood.
And they estimated that it's volume.

2094
01:48:27,151 --> 01:48:30,150
They called it river warren.
They estimated it as volume,

2095
01:48:30,151 --> 01:48:35,151
might've been 4,000
times greater than the modern Minnesota 

2096
01:48:35,151 --> 01:48:36,890
river that's flowing in there.
So I felt very vindicated from that.

2097
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:41,160
And this was by the early eighties.
So that was like one of the key things.

2098
01:48:41,161 --> 01:48:42,180
There was other things,
you know,

2099
01:48:42,181 --> 01:48:47,181
I um,
I spent the summer of 1970 mostly 

2100
01:48:47,181 --> 01:48:48,910
sitting on a mountain top in Colorado,
you know,

2101
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:52,780
in a hut that I had built studying and 
reading stuff and,

2102
01:48:52,781 --> 01:48:53,880
and,
and traveling.

2103
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:58,910
I knoW this was back in the days when 
you could hitchhike and travel all over 

2104
01:48:58,910 --> 01:49:03,111
and I think at one point I was with a 
buddy and we were in his old camper van 

2105
01:49:03,111 --> 01:49:07,461
and other times I would teach anchor,
but I spent the whole summer traveling 

2106
01:49:07,461 --> 01:49:11,181
around the western states.
And the thing I came away from that 

2107
01:49:11,581 --> 01:49:16,581
summer with the.
I'd traveled the first time I had 

2108
01:49:16,581 --> 01:49:17,010
traveled down to columbia gorge.
And as I did,

2109
01:49:17,011 --> 01:49:22,011
I had this overwhelming sense that there
was something in the landscape that I 

2110
01:49:22,141 --> 01:49:23,280
was,
that was,

2111
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:29,690
that was waiting to be revealed.
I would look at these features in the 

2112
01:49:29,690 --> 01:49:33,321
columbia records when I showed you that 
huge waterfall with the basalt over and 

2113
01:49:33,321 --> 01:49:37,550
that's in the columbia gorge.
So that was the area I had traveled 

2114
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:40,791
through in 1970.
And I came away with that with this 

2115
01:49:40,791 --> 01:49:41,010
sense,
that point or something that,

2116
01:49:41,011 --> 01:49:45,990
that landscape is trying to tell me.
And so it goes back to that and I just,

2117
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:48,400
you know,
I got very in this stuff

2118
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:51,910
because I'm interested a in science and 
I love the outdoors.

2119
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:55,080
So I love a good mystery,
you know,

2120
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:56,680
and I love,
you know,

2121
01:49:56,710 --> 01:50:00,700
ancient traditions were.
So all this sort of came together over a

2122
01:50:00,701 --> 01:50:02,810
period of a couple of decades.
Um,

2123
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:08,580
so I began really,
I would say obsessive lee really going 

2124
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:10,360
into this in the early eighties,
you know,

2125
01:50:10,361 --> 01:50:14,470
where it went from,
just more or less casual reading into,

2126
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:20,010
you know,
spending hours in university libraries 

2127
01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:21,760
for digging up these things.
Going back to the ninth,

2128
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:25,780
going back to the early geologists to 
see what were they saying,

2129
01:50:25,781 --> 01:50:29,950
why did they believe that the history of
the earth had been catastrophic,

2130
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:31,150
you know,
and um,

2131
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:36,720
and it just accelerated.
It doesn't seem like a ridiculous idea 

2132
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:41,101
at all.
When you consider what we see on the 

2133
01:50:41,101 --> 01:50:41,590
moon and the moon is so fascinating 
because we can look right at it.

2134
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:44,050
There's no oceans,
there's no forests.

2135
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:48,280
We can see the evidence of impacts all 
over it just completely covered,

2136
01:50:48,281 --> 01:50:53,281
completely covered with our minds living
in this very small window of life,

2137
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:54,520
you know,
if we're lucky,

2138
01:50:54,521 --> 01:50:59,521
we get 100 years and then of course we 
have the history which goes back to 

2139
01:50:59,521 --> 01:51:03,301
about seven plus thousand years.
This is not enough to really to 

2140
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:06,100
represent what we're looking at.
When we look at the moon,

2141
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:08,860
we look at the moon that's covered with 
craters.

2142
01:51:09,070 --> 01:51:13,240
We're looking at potentially billions of
years of impacts.

2143
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:14,010
Yes.
And,

2144
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:19,040
and the assumption that those impacts 
ceased hundreds of millions or billions 

2145
01:51:20,230 --> 01:51:22,300
of years ago is clearly not correct.
Well,

2146
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:24,870
there's no evidence that seized or why 
it would cease.

2147
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:30,400
When we look at how many we known near 
earth objects are floating around.

2148
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:35,790
Oh,
in the last few years there's been 

2149
01:51:35,790 --> 01:51:37,381
dozens of close flybys.
That was one the other day that had a 

2150
01:51:37,381 --> 01:51:37,381
fucking moon.

2151
01:51:37,381 --> 01:51:38,110
Yes.
Yes.

2152
01:51:38,530 --> 01:51:42,460
So something that flew by that have its 
own moon.

2153
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:43,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

2154
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:46,630
That's wild.
And so think about this,

2155
01:51:46,631 --> 01:51:47,680
joe.
Here's what's happening.

2156
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:53,310
We've got geologists who are looking at 
the crust of the earth in discovering 

2157
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:53,650
that,
yeah,

2158
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:58,680
if we strip away the biosphere in the 
oceans and an account for plate 

2159
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:02,971
tectonics,
the earth is going to look like the 

2160
01:52:02,971 --> 01:52:02,971
moon.
Right?

2161
01:52:02,971 --> 01:52:04,750
Are noW hundreds of identified craters,
right?

2162
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:10,200
At the same time,
astronomers are looking out into the 

2163
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,470
near space near the near earth 
neighborhood of space and discovering,

2164
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:17,010
wait a second,
we assumed that we were pretty much 

2165
01:52:17,010 --> 01:52:17,800
isolated.
There was nothing else going on.

2166
01:52:17,801 --> 01:52:21,280
We're now realizing that near or spaces 
densely populated,

2167
01:52:21,281 --> 01:52:26,281
the inner solar system is densely 
populated with cosmic debris and this 

2168
01:52:27,131 --> 01:52:31,270
stuff is western bias all the time and 
it's now at the same time.

2169
01:52:31,300 --> 01:52:36,300
You've got paleontologists who are 
looking at the record of life and 

2170
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:40,030
realizing that the record of life is not
a smooth curve.

2171
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:42,150
It seesawed,
you know,

2172
01:52:42,370 --> 01:52:47,370
life proliferates and then suddenly bam.
It's like the hammer comes down and you 

2173
01:52:47,370 --> 01:52:49,940
have these mass extinction events,
so this is our time right now,

2174
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:54,970
but it could very easily end.
There could be some new bug like 

2175
01:52:54,970 --> 01:52:58,820
creature that takes over and become 
super smart a billion years from now.

2176
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:00,620
To me,
it all comes down to this.

2177
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:03,530
This to me is like,
okay,

2178
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:09,040
human species on planet earth,
it's time for you to grow up and start 

2179
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,670
paying attention to the bigger picture 
because whether you like it or not,

2180
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:13,430
you're a part of the bigger picture.
And if we,

2181
01:53:13,490 --> 01:53:18,490
if we finally accept the fact that maybe
our predecessors have undergone in a 

2182
01:53:18,490 --> 01:53:20,210
sense,
cultural mass extinctions,

2183
01:53:20,690 --> 01:53:25,690
you know,
it suddenly implies that we can't take 

2184
01:53:25,690 --> 01:53:28,740
our own unending future for granted that
we have.

2185
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:31,820
We have to incorporate this bigger 
picture into our thinking.

2186
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:37,300
and you know,
the evidence has continues to yes.

2187
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:43,720
Like here,
this was just from 2011 multiple lines 

2188
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:46,520
of evidence for possible human 
population decline.

2189
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:49,520
Settlement reorganization during the 
early,

2190
01:53:49,521 --> 01:53:53,270
younger dryas into three years,
four years since this was published.

2191
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:56,800
More evidence has emerged that yes,
the,

2192
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:02,520
the events that caused the mass 
extinction of half the great mega 

2193
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:05,681
mammals on earth did not leave the rest 
of the mammals the rest of the animals 

2194
01:54:05,751 --> 01:54:07,580
unscathed,
including humans.

2195
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:12,880
And there is now emerging evidence,
hard scientific evidence that the human 

2196
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:13,850
population crashed during the younger 
dryas.

2197
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:20,260
So this would completely coincide with 
graham hancock's ideas about the sphinx.

2198
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:25,580
Sphinx.
Absolutely showing very clear,

2199
01:54:25,581 --> 01:54:29,540
according to robert schoch,
boston university geologists,

2200
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:31,310
John Anthony West,
John Anthony West,

2201
01:54:31,550 --> 01:54:34,790
that there is clear evidence of water 
erosion on the sphinx,

2202
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:40,030
which would indicate thousands of years 
of rainfall where there hasn't been 

2203
01:54:40,161 --> 01:54:43,270
rainfall in the nile valley since,
I believe it was 9,000

2204
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:43,820
bc.

2205
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:46,340
So that's 11,000
years ago.

2206
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,530
It's all the same stuff.
It's all the same stuff.

2207
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,240
God,
this is crazy.

2208
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:51,320
Yeah,
we're,

2209
01:54:51,321 --> 01:54:51,800
we're,
we're,

2210
01:54:51,801 --> 01:54:56,801
we're on the verge of a major paradIgm 
shift and where it's going to go remains

2211
01:54:58,401 --> 01:55:00,260
to be seen.
We live in a shooting gallery.

2212
01:55:00,350 --> 01:55:02,450
We live.
We listened.

2213
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:06,710
it's not an exaggeration to say that we 
are sitting ducks in a cosmic shooting.

2214
01:55:06,711 --> 01:55:07,880
Gail.
Exactly.

2215
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:11,900
But the point is,
here's the point,

2216
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:14,570
is the only thing that's see,
it's like,

2217
01:55:14,930 --> 01:55:16,790
what was it in the.
In the book of matthew,

2218
01:55:16,791 --> 01:55:18,210
there's an interesting quote,
and I'm not,

2219
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:23,880
I'm not not thumping the bible here,
but the bible is full of just like all 

2220
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:27,551
the traditions of ages are gone.
The bible is full of some very powerful,

2221
01:55:27,741 --> 01:55:32,741
interesting stuff.
There's a part in here and we're one of 

2222
01:55:32,741 --> 01:55:35,090
the disciples asked jesus about when are
we going to know about the end of days?

2223
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:36,260
And he says,
well,

2224
01:55:36,261 --> 01:55:41,261
as it was in the days of noah,
when the people were eating and drinking

2225
01:55:41,701 --> 01:55:46,701
and marrying and giving in marriage.
So will it be again in the days,

2226
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:52,040
the end of days when the flood comes,
when the people were eating and 

2227
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:56,361
drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage until 

2228
01:55:56,361 --> 01:55:58,650
the flood came and swept them away.
So will it be again at the end of days?

2229
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:03,680
So what that seems to indicate to me is 
that we just get comfortable and relaxed

2230
01:56:03,961 --> 01:56:06,390
and do well.
And when we do well,

2231
01:56:06,391 --> 01:56:11,391
that's when you get hit.
But it's not saying that the everyday 

2232
01:56:11,391 --> 01:56:12,150
stuff,
the stuff of everyday life,

2233
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:13,770
there's anything wrong.
It's not saying that,

2234
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:18,800
it's just saying if we get so 
preoccupied with the minutia and the 

2235
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:21,300
trivia of everyday life to the exclusion
of the bigger picture,

2236
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:23,910
that's when we open ourselves up with 
has been.

2237
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:29,360
I've had these weird coNversations with 
people about asteroidal impacts over the

2238
01:56:29,490 --> 01:56:29,840
years because I've.

2239
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,670
Before I even met you,
I've been obsessed with this stuff.

2240
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:38,060
not nearly as much as when I met you in 
atlanta and we started talking then I 

2241
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:41,691
got really into it.
but would they would talk about the 

2242
01:56:41,691 --> 01:56:42,240
asteroids that killed the dinosaur.
Oh,

2243
01:56:42,241 --> 01:56:44,670
today we'd be able to stop that.
And I'm like,

2244
01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:45,750
okay,
really?

2245
01:56:45,810 --> 01:56:47,760
Is that true?
And then I started looking into it.

2246
01:56:47,761 --> 01:56:49,860
Well,
what has been done is nothing.

2247
01:56:49,890 --> 01:56:51,750
Some fucking theories.
See here,

2248
01:56:51,780 --> 01:56:54,360
here's the thing.
Potentially yes we could.

2249
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:55,790
Someday we could do it.
And,

2250
01:56:55,791 --> 01:56:57,370
and really,
you know,

2251
01:56:57,390 --> 01:56:59,010
within,
within a decade or two.

2252
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:02,280
Yes we could.
We could do that right now potentially.

2253
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:07,610
But see what happened on February 15th 
of 2014 when that little meatier came in

2254
01:57:07,651 --> 01:57:12,651
and exploded over chelyabinsk siberia 
injured 1500 people now in damaged 

2255
01:57:15,361 --> 01:57:18,000
thousands of buildings.
That was a wake up call,

2256
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:19,860
right?
That was a little suspect.

2257
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:22,500
it was a little speck.
Now here's the thing,

2258
01:57:22,650 --> 01:57:25,650
if he had been a little bigger,
a little dancer,

2259
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:28,650
if it's an angle of approach,
had been a little steeper.

2260
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:31,230
If it's velocity had been a little bit 
greater,

2261
01:57:31,231 --> 01:57:36,231
we might've been looking at thousands of
deaths rather than just injuries and 

2262
01:57:36,231 --> 01:57:37,350
tunguska,
as you said,

2263
01:57:37,351 --> 01:57:42,090
only 150 foot wide.
Only 150 foot wide objeCt.

2264
01:57:42,091 --> 01:57:42,750
Right,
right.

2265
01:57:42,751 --> 01:57:45,680
So that's very,
very small in the cosmic sense.

2266
01:57:45,690 --> 01:57:47,600
This room.
Yeah.

2267
01:57:47,650 --> 01:57:50,850
Well it's the building from here to the 
front door,

2268
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:52,830
you knoW what I mean?
That's not that big.

2269
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:57,860
It's not that big.
Once you've got though is velocity and 

2270
01:57:57,860 --> 01:57:57,860
you think like,
you know,

2271
01:57:57,860 --> 01:58:00,000
think of a say a 38 slug.
It's not big.

2272
01:58:00,001 --> 01:58:02,280
If I was to throw it at you,
even as hard as I could,

2273
01:58:02,281 --> 01:58:04,710
it might sting a little bit,
but it wouldn't do any damage,

2274
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:10,100
but if it came out of a gun with a 
muzzle velocity of a thousand feet per 

2275
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:13,671
second,
think about that little thing and what 

2276
01:58:13,671 --> 01:58:15,411
the damage it would do to you and see.
That's the thing about an asteroid or 

2277
01:58:15,411 --> 01:58:17,370
meteorite or a comet coming in.
It's moving really,

2278
01:58:17,371 --> 01:58:19,660
really fast.
You know,

2279
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:22,590
so that's why,
like I said,

2280
01:58:22,591 --> 01:58:27,591
it packs such a powerful kinetic punch 
when it hits and some of them are even 

2281
01:58:27,591 --> 01:58:31,971
made of iron.
Some of them are made of iron and so.

2282
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:34,140
So if,
if there's,

2283
01:58:34,170 --> 01:58:37,290
if there's a moral dollar this,
it's simply this look,

2284
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:41,980
we are the one species that could 
prevent the type of mass

2285
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:45,820
extinctions that have dominated the 
biosphere of this planet for a couple of

2286
01:58:45,821 --> 01:58:50,821
hundred million years.
Or we could keep putting our resources 

2287
01:58:50,821 --> 01:58:50,821
to fracking.
Yeah.

2288
01:58:50,821 --> 01:58:55,620
Well,
I still haven't made up my mind about 

2289
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:57,370
fracking yet,
but I do believe that what we need to do

2290
01:58:57,430 --> 01:59:02,430
is be thinking of,
if we're going to extract the resources 

2291
01:59:02,430 --> 01:59:06,061
of this planet,
let's do so in such a way that what 

2292
01:59:06,061 --> 01:59:09,631
we're doing is implementing the 
transcendence of human culture into the 

2293
01:59:10,151 --> 01:59:13,300
cosmos itself,
because I ultimately believe that is the

2294
01:59:13,301 --> 01:59:17,920
destiny of terrestrial life is the 
terrestrial life wants to become cosmic.

2295
01:59:17,950 --> 01:59:22,030
It knows on some level that as long as 
life,

2296
01:59:22,031 --> 01:59:24,610
it's confined to the surface of a 
planet.

2297
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:26,500
It's vulnerable.
Right?

2298
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:27,450
And,
and you know,

2299
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:29,410
without getting into all of this,
there's,

2300
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:34,500
there's growing evidence that life 
originally came to this planet from 

2301
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:34,570
space,
right?

2302
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:39,010
Was seated here probably through comets 
that carry organic material.

2303
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:40,650
All been.
Spare me her hand sperm.

2304
01:59:40,651 --> 01:59:41,620
Yeah,
exactly.

2305
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:47,520
So here's the thing,
if you're an environmentalist and 

2306
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:52,500
rightfully critical of some of the 
things that humans are doing to disrupt 

2307
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:54,730
the environment you got to the place in 
context,

2308
01:59:54,731 --> 01:59:59,731
the fact that nature itself has done 
things to the environment so that so far

2309
02:00:00,011 --> 02:00:03,880
exceed anything we have done yet what I 
showed you with that slide,

2310
02:00:03,910 --> 02:00:07,060
showing the ice sheets over candidate.
Think about this.

2311
02:00:07,690 --> 02:00:12,640
Suppose some logging company got a 
contract from the government,

2312
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:17,840
us and canadian governments to clear cut
every forest from like the 47th parallel

2313
02:00:19,150 --> 02:00:21,760
up to the arctic circle from the 
atlantic to the pacific.

2314
02:00:21,761 --> 02:00:26,761
We're going to cut every single tree 
from the northern United States up to 

2315
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:28,990
the tree line in,
in northern Canada.

2316
02:00:29,290 --> 02:00:32,470
We're going to cut billions of trees,
billions of board feet.

2317
02:00:32,471 --> 02:00:34,270
we're going to clear cut every single 
tree.

2318
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:36,850
We would rightfully be up in arms and 
say,

2319
02:00:36,851 --> 02:00:38,080
no,
you're not going to do that.

2320
02:00:38,380 --> 02:00:39,250
Right?
well,

2321
02:00:39,251 --> 02:00:42,520
what do you think that ice did?
It wiped out.

2322
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:45,220
You know,
there's evidence now that 35 and 40,000

2323
02:00:45,221 --> 02:00:47,470
years ago,
there were forests growing up there,

2324
02:00:48,050 --> 02:00:50,440
right?
A few thousand years later,

2325
02:00:50,890 --> 02:00:55,890
the ice has bulldozed everything.
There's no forest growing under two 

2326
02:00:55,890 --> 02:00:55,890
miles of ice,
right?

2327
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:57,940
Imagine if we said,
well,

2328
02:00:57,941 --> 02:01:01,360
we're going to just decimate the shallow
marine ecology.

2329
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:06,420
We're going to go in there and we're 
going to just wiPe out the coral reefs 

2330
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:06,420
were going to overfish them till there's
no nothing,

2331
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:08,420
nothing left of the shallow marine 
ecology.

2332
02:01:08,570 --> 02:01:12,670
Ecology is less than 400 feet below sea 
level.

2333
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:18,510
What do you think are dropping 400 feet,
400 feet in the c level did to the 

2334
02:01:18,510 --> 02:01:22,360
shallow marine ecologies to the coral 
reefs that were growing there.

2335
02:01:22,630 --> 02:01:25,630
You see,
that's where I'm just saying it's not to

2336
02:01:25,631 --> 02:01:29,350
justify that we can ransacked nature 
willy nilly,

2337
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:34,560
but it's to say we have to have a 
realistic context for thinking about 

2338
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:38,491
this and bear in mind that the 
environmental movement was born during 

2339
02:01:38,531 --> 02:01:40,370
an era of total

2340
02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:43,670
gradual listic dominance in the fifties 
and sixties.

2341
02:01:43,671 --> 02:01:46,940
If you go back down again,
only the fringe,

2342
02:01:46,990 --> 02:01:47,400
the,
the,

2343
02:01:47,401 --> 02:01:48,000
the,
you know,

2344
02:01:48,090 --> 02:01:48,690
the,
the,

2345
02:01:49,070 --> 02:01:54,070
the,
the fringe science people like vela 

2346
02:01:54,070 --> 02:01:54,830
kowski and others were talking about 
catastrophes.

2347
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:59,660
The assumption was is that all global 
change occurred one grain of sand or one

2348
02:01:59,661 --> 02:02:01,610
drop of water at a time,
right?

2349
02:02:02,210 --> 02:02:07,210
Well,
we've come a hundred 80 degrees from 

2350
02:02:07,210 --> 02:02:10,211
that model of earth history,
but our thinking has not really evolved 

2351
02:02:10,211 --> 02:02:10,230
to,
to,

2352
02:02:10,350 --> 02:02:14,110
to incorporate such a dynamic planet.
You knoW,

2353
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:15,260
at this point.
Now see,

2354
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:17,600
so when the environmental movement was 
born,

2355
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:21,060
it was easy to think that if,
if all change,

2356
02:02:21,061 --> 02:02:23,600
it had happened at this imperceptibly 
slow rate.

2357
02:02:23,980 --> 02:02:28,980
Obviously didn't humans have accelerated
that pace of change and humans are now 

2358
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:30,710
contributing to know more global change 
than,

2359
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:35,740
than we've seen in millions of years.
If that uniformitarian undergraduate 

2360
02:02:35,740 --> 02:02:38,090
holistic model was correct,
but it's not.

2361
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:44,140
And I'm afraid that thEre's a large 
faction of the environmental movement 

2362
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:47,801
that's still locked into that thinking 
of a gradual evolution of the planet.

2363
02:02:49,820 --> 02:02:51,950
One grain of water,
one drop of water,

2364
02:02:51,951 --> 02:02:55,940
one grain of sand at a time,
and that it has not suffered any kind of

2365
02:02:55,941 --> 02:03:00,290
disruption until we bad humans came 
along and started,

2366
02:03:00,350 --> 02:03:03,590
you know,
with our factories and our oil wells and

2367
02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:07,970
our movies and everything else.
But you know,

2368
02:03:07,971 --> 02:03:12,971
clearly we have to come to terms with 
the fact that we live on one hell of a 

2369
02:03:12,971 --> 02:03:16,661
dynamic planet in one hell of a dynamic 
solar system was a hell of a dying 

2370
02:03:16,661 --> 02:03:16,760
without jupiter.
Right.

2371
02:03:16,761 --> 02:03:18,950
We'd be fucked a long time.
We would be.

2372
02:03:19,110 --> 02:03:22,250
Somebody said they wanted to hear me say
the word fuck at least once.

2373
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:26,830
So I'll throw out.
Go ahead and throw it.

2374
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:27,830
Yeah,
we would be fucked.

2375
02:03:27,970 --> 02:03:32,970
Jupiter is the big,
kind of like the bouncer for all the 

2376
02:03:32,970 --> 02:03:36,650
bigger asteroids that get sucked into 
jupiter can play a dual role.

2377
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:39,740
See jupiter connect as a as.
Yeah,

2378
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:43,280
the bouncer that it kicks a lot of those
guys back out,

2379
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:46,720
back out into the kuyper disk or 
wherever they came from or from.

2380
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:51,500
But it can also hurdle stuff in towards 
us.

2381
02:03:51,501 --> 02:03:56,501
It can do either one.
Sacred geometry is a subject that I 

2382
02:03:56,501 --> 02:04:00,401
wanted to talk to you about because we.
We could go on about cataclysmic impacts

2383
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:05,800
forever,
but it's one of the things that you 

2384
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:07,601
mentioned at the end of our last podcast
that you wanted to talk about on this 

2385
02:04:07,601 --> 02:04:10,910
one and it's the name of your 
organization.

2386
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:12,140
Sacred geometry.
Well,

2387
02:04:12,141 --> 02:04:14,650
it's the name of the website.
Yeah.

2388
02:04:15,170 --> 02:04:17,360
I could find some stuff here to show you
about that.

2389
02:04:17,361 --> 02:04:18,960
And,
and it dovetails because bayer,

2390
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:21,890
remember we're talking here a lot about 
geology,

2391
02:04:22,490 --> 02:04:24,140
geometry,
right?

2392
02:04:24,141 --> 02:04:27,920
They both are sciences that have evolved
out of the study of the earth.

2393
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:30,500
And uh,
you know,

2394
02:04:30,570 --> 02:04:33,590
one of the things that I've done is,
is in geology.

2395
02:04:33,591 --> 02:04:35,660
We have this thing called scale and 
variance,

2396
02:04:36,230 --> 02:04:38,280
which is that if you're looking a 
geological picture,

2397
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:43,520
you're always gonna.
See somebody you're going to see like a 

2398
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:46,551
rock pick set in the picture,
you're going to see a person standing 

2399
02:04:46,551 --> 02:04:50,481
there because oftentimes you don't have 
a sense of the scale of what you're 

2400
02:04:50,481 --> 02:04:50,481
looking at.
Right?

2401
02:04:50,481 --> 02:04:54,830
If,
and in geometry we have the same 

2402
02:04:54,830 --> 02:04:55,710
phenomena.
It's also kind of the modern term for it

2403
02:04:55,711 --> 02:04:59,010
is fractal association where the part 
looks,

2404
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:01,110
the smaller part looks like the bigger 
whole.

2405
02:05:01,111 --> 02:05:06,111
And that's one of the basic working 
ideas of sacred geometry and it's the 

2406
02:05:06,111 --> 02:05:11,001
same idea of what I was describing 
standing there looking into the 

2407
02:05:11,001 --> 02:05:14,230
Minnesota river valley.
This was an example of scale in variance

2408
02:05:14,310 --> 02:05:18,300
that you had the same,
that the big channel was just a much,

2409
02:05:18,301 --> 02:05:20,730
much larger version of this small 
channel.

2410
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:23,280
And if you didn't have a scale of 
reference,

2411
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:25,860
you couldn't tell really what you're 
looking at,

2412
02:05:25,861 --> 02:05:27,600
how,
how big or how small it is.

2413
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:30,750
See.
So in the study of sacred geometry,

2414
02:05:30,751 --> 02:05:33,960
one of the fundamental ideas is this 
idea of scale and variance.

2415
02:05:33,961 --> 02:05:37,200
So when I first was interested in 
geometry,

2416
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:42,260
because geometry I think is one of the 
keys to decipher in many of the ancient 

2417
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:43,650
traditions.
LIke you know,

2418
02:05:43,651 --> 02:05:48,651
I became a.
Somebody wanted me to talk about 

2419
02:05:48,651 --> 02:05:48,900
freemasonry and I can talk about that up
to a certain extent.

2420
02:05:50,110 --> 02:05:53,760
You know,
one of the things that I learned as soon

2421
02:05:53,761 --> 02:05:58,761
as I actually,
I think I learned it before I was 

2422
02:05:58,761 --> 02:06:00,381
actually initiated into the masonic 
fraternity in 1978 was that at the core 

2423
02:06:01,201 --> 02:06:03,570
of all of the masonic symbolism was 
geometry.

2424
02:06:04,230 --> 02:06:07,350
If you wanted to understand the message 
of the great cathedrals,

2425
02:06:07,770 --> 02:06:11,060
you had to have geometry.
If you wanted to understand the,

2426
02:06:11,061 --> 02:06:11,630
the,
the,

2427
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:16,710
the,
this amazing plethora of symbolism that 

2428
02:06:16,710 --> 02:06:20,001
has of which masons are the custodians.
You had to study geometry and 

2429
02:06:20,821 --> 02:06:25,821
secondarily you had to study astronomy,
so that sort of confirmed some of the 

2430
02:06:25,821 --> 02:06:29,030
ideas I had already been thinking at the
time that I went in in the,

2431
02:06:29,050 --> 02:06:30,180
in the late seventies.

2432
02:06:31,290 --> 02:06:35,530
Freemasonry is full of symbolism.
Why did you join the freemasons?

2433
02:06:35,950 --> 02:06:37,710
Well know,
because for one thing,

2434
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:40,530
I've always loved you.
I come from a family of builders.

2435
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:43,140
I build things for a living.
That's what I do.

2436
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:45,360
I design things and build things for a 
living.

2437
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:46,890
That's what I.
How I make my money.

2438
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:52,310
So I was always interested in the built 
environment and somewhere along the line

2439
02:06:52,441 --> 02:06:57,441
I just began to realize that there was a
whole lot more to the built environment 

2440
02:06:57,441 --> 02:07:00,951
of ancient times that in modern times 
you look at architecture in that 

2441
02:07:01,171 --> 02:07:06,171
architecture is not necessarily 
symbolical except on a very abstract 

2442
02:07:06,301 --> 02:07:11,301
sense.
I became aware of the fact that the 

2443
02:07:11,301 --> 02:07:11,301
ancient architecture,
the ancient structures,

2444
02:07:11,301 --> 02:07:14,020
whether it's the pyramids of giza or 
stonehenge or angkor wat,

2445
02:07:14,021 --> 02:07:18,720
are the mayan temples.
There are all profoundly symbolic.

2446
02:07:19,410 --> 02:07:22,050
They're not just built because,
hey,

2447
02:07:22,110 --> 02:07:23,340
it looks good.
No,

2448
02:07:23,430 --> 02:07:25,980
it's,
they convey information.

2449
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:27,750
um,
you know,

2450
02:07:27,751 --> 02:07:29,400
cathedrals.
It was victor hugo who,

2451
02:07:29,401 --> 02:07:33,330
who referred to some of the great 
cathedrals as being literal textbooks in

2452
02:07:33,331 --> 02:07:36,460
stone and that's what they are.
Sharp cathedral,

2453
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:39,040
beautiful example of a textbook and 
stone.

2454
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,900
And,
and uh,

2455
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:46,560
I have,
I don't know if you've ever been to any 

2456
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:47,920
of the cathedral that that's something 
you need to put on your bucket list.

2457
02:07:47,921 --> 02:07:52,921
Joe.
I'm planning on going to europe this 

2458
02:07:52,921 --> 02:07:55,920
summer,
so when I do on a vacation instead of 

2459
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:55,920
working.
Yeah,

2460
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:55,920
that's.
Yeah,

2461
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:58,780
make it a research vacation.
It will make a lot more interesting.

2462
02:07:58,781 --> 02:08:00,550
And maria,
go have kids.

2463
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:05,670
It's tough to do a lot of research.
We've got little kids get bored real 

2464
02:08:05,670 --> 02:08:05,670
easy,
but I'm going to check some shit out.

2465
02:08:05,740 --> 02:08:06,780
Checks and shit out,
you know,

2466
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:11,020
and I can send you some places that I 
don't know about your kids,

2467
02:08:11,021 --> 02:08:13,870
but I could easily have been eight years
old and been totally blown away by.

2468
02:08:14,850 --> 02:08:17,840
Well,
one of the things about the freemasons,

2469
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:23,040
the idea of the free masons is that it's
a secret society and this a secret,

2470
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:28,520
you know,
and people associated with the 

2471
02:08:28,520 --> 02:08:29,560
illuminati and the people that control 
the world and don't.

2472
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:32,360
I wish.
But no,

2473
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:36,430
I think I would love to be the dick,
dick supreme dictator of the world.

2474
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:38,560
Really.
Why would you do differently?

2475
02:08:39,070 --> 02:08:41,910
Differently?
We could get into.

2476
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:42,700
That's going to be,
yeah,

2477
02:08:42,701 --> 02:08:45,120
that's a five hour body,
but that's a different podcast.

2478
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:50,520
But the.
But when you say like I'm a mason,

2479
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:52,700
people would automatically,
you know,

2480
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:57,720
especially ignorant people would 
automatically assume that you're a part 

2481
02:08:57,720 --> 02:09:00,901
of some sort of society that's 
victimizing the general population and 

2482
02:09:01,451 --> 02:09:06,010
you're involved with the people that put
the eyeball on top of the pyramid that's

2483
02:09:06,011 --> 02:09:09,430
on the dollar bill and your,
you know,

2484
02:09:09,431 --> 02:09:11,050
I don't even know where to start with 
some of that.

2485
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:16,220
Are there secrets in the freemasons 
where you're not allowed to talk about 

2486
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:16,220
it?
Well,

2487
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:19,120
bear in mind now secrets in in the 
middle ages,

2488
02:09:19,150 --> 02:09:23,500
there were trade secrets and building 
secrets.

2489
02:09:23,530 --> 02:09:24,410
Clearly,
you know,

2490
02:09:25,690 --> 02:09:28,510
and when you went through the process of
initiation,

2491
02:09:28,511 --> 02:09:30,580
you learned about these secrets,
right?

2492
02:09:30,910 --> 02:09:35,910
But it's not that really that different.
The idea than say modern commercial or 

2493
02:09:37,091 --> 02:09:38,560
industrial secrets,
you know,

2494
02:09:38,561 --> 02:09:41,400
coke has,
it keeps it formula secret.

2495
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:41,890
Right?
Right.

2496
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:46,900
And has done so for 100 years.
But the thing was is you got to realize 

2497
02:09:47,470 --> 02:09:52,470
that freemasonry became an outlawed 
organization right during the middle 

2498
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:57,160
ages when the church was persecuting 
anybody who was branded a heretic,

2499
02:09:57,190 --> 02:10:00,970
which could have meant anything that 
they wanted to be free.

2500
02:10:00,971 --> 02:10:05,971
Masonry had to go underground.
And that's the primary reason for the 

2501
02:10:05,971 --> 02:10:10,471
secrecy is because it was a survival 
strategy and it only reemerged in nearly

2502
02:10:12,161 --> 02:10:17,161
1700 with the consolidation of four 
lodges in britain to become the modern 

2503
02:10:17,381 --> 02:10:19,870
institution freemason.
And you know,

2504
02:10:19,930 --> 02:10:21,940
to anybody who comes up with that,
I would just challenge him,

2505
02:10:21,941 --> 02:10:23,530
show me the hard evidence,
show me that,

2506
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:24,940
you know,
I like to say that.

2507
02:10:24,941 --> 02:10:25,300
Well,
yeah,

2508
02:10:25,301 --> 02:10:26,290
I'll admit,
you know,

2509
02:10:26,291 --> 02:10:29,380
14 of the american presidents have been 
free masons,

2510
02:10:29,620 --> 02:10:33,800
but 22 of them were episcopalians.
So clearly that implies me that it's the

2511
02:10:33,801 --> 02:10:34,760
episcopalians

2512
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:36,860
who are the puppet masters ruling the 
world,

2513
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:39,410
right?
If you want to make that argument,

2514
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:41,750
well why were they freemasons?
Like,

2515
02:10:41,751 --> 02:10:43,610
what's the benefits of being a 
freemason?

2516
02:10:43,910 --> 02:10:45,530
Well,
for one thing,

2517
02:10:45,531 --> 02:10:50,531
what you're doing is you're aligning 
yourself with probably the oldest 

2518
02:10:50,531 --> 02:10:53,861
institution.
It still exists on the planet that goes 

2519
02:10:53,861 --> 02:10:54,110
back.
Now we can historically trace it back to

2520
02:10:54,111 --> 02:10:59,111
the middle ages.
But if you go back further than that 

2521
02:10:59,111 --> 02:11:01,070
wild,
the historical continuity breaks down.

2522
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:03,870
We can go back and we can talk about the
coma.

2523
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:06,730
Chines and Italy.
We can talk about the martin lists,

2524
02:11:06,740 --> 02:11:08,020
we can talk about the,
um,

2525
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:13,900
the myth reyes tradition.
we can talk about the mysteries of 

2526
02:11:13,900 --> 02:11:13,900
Egypt.
Uh,

2527
02:11:13,900 --> 02:11:16,670
we can talk about the,
the zoroastrian tradition.

2528
02:11:16,950 --> 02:11:18,470
Um,
the list goes on,

2529
02:11:18,471 --> 02:11:23,471
the loc and mysteries.
And what we see is a structure of 

2530
02:11:23,471 --> 02:11:26,681
initiation,
it's virtually identical in all these 

2531
02:11:26,681 --> 02:11:26,681
cases to what modern freemasonry is.

2532
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:30,830
And I'm with modern freemasonry 
basically,

2533
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:36,280
you know,
you have a whole cross section of 

2534
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:37,760
individuals that join who,
who a lot of them joined simply because,

2535
02:11:37,761 --> 02:11:39,350
hey,
my dad was a freemason,

2536
02:11:39,410 --> 02:11:41,120
or my uncle,
it was a family tradition.

2537
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:45,260
So that's why I joined.
Others joined because free masons raised

2538
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:47,690
every year,
raised millions of dollars for charity,

2539
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:51,590
mostly for children's,
a charitable causes,

2540
02:11:51,591 --> 02:11:56,591
you know,
they run the scottish rite hospital for 

2541
02:11:56,591 --> 02:11:57,740
crippled children.
They run I hospitals and you know,

2542
02:11:57,830 --> 02:12:02,830
children that need medical care,
they can go to these hospitals and not 

2543
02:12:02,830 --> 02:12:06,290
have to pay anything.
So they're fraternal organization or one

2544
02:12:06,291 --> 02:12:09,740
of the largest charitable organizations 
on the planet in terms of the money that

2545
02:12:09,741 --> 02:12:10,940
they raised.
You know,

2546
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:12,920
again,
jesus said by their,

2547
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:14,660
by their works,
you shall know them.

2548
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:16,060
You know,
um,

2549
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:19,040
you know,
you can twist that around,

2550
02:12:19,130 --> 02:12:21,260
perversely,
twist that around and say that some kind

2551
02:12:21,261 --> 02:12:23,290
of nefarious strategy to,
you know,

2552
02:12:23,350 --> 02:12:24,380
whatever,
get control.

2553
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:29,920
The other side of the equation is that 
they're also custodians of this body of 

2554
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:34,060
ancient symbolism were all of these 
things that we have been talking about 

2555
02:12:34,490 --> 02:12:36,810
basically are encoded.
Um,

2556
02:12:37,300 --> 02:12:38,010
and,
and,

2557
02:12:38,020 --> 02:12:40,580
and I could pull up some interesting 
stuff here.

2558
02:12:40,610 --> 02:12:45,610
Did you know that you could look at to 
see what we're actually talking about 

2559
02:12:46,311 --> 02:12:46,790
there?
But,

2560
02:12:46,910 --> 02:12:51,910
but yeah,
they have this amazing body of 

2561
02:12:51,910 --> 02:12:51,910
symbolism.
Let me,

2562
02:12:51,910 --> 02:12:55,840
let me pull it.
Here's how big an example of a masonic 

2563
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:55,840
apron.
Okay,

2564
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:57,650
let's take a look at this.
we'll zoom in here.

2565
02:12:58,700 --> 02:13:02,720
And what do you see right at the very 
center of this symbol?

2566
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:04,630
Symbolical array.
What do you,

2567
02:13:04,670 --> 02:13:07,970
what is that?
I think it's a barn.

2568
02:13:08,270 --> 02:13:10,610
It's not a bar of the ark,
the ark,

2569
02:13:11,140 --> 02:13:11,530
it's,
you know,

2570
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:13,580
it's probably a noah's ark of noah's 
ark.

2571
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:18,640
So that's the.
So that's supposed to be the ocean 

2572
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:18,890
around it and it's floating in the 
waters of the great flood.

2573
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:20,360
And,
and if you look closely,

2574
02:13:20,361 --> 02:13:22,400
I know it's hard to tell,
but growing out of here,

2575
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:25,040
that's a chicken.
What's an acacia?

2576
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:30,670
The acacia has impatient bush,
a masonic symbol for rebirth 

2577
02:13:30,670 --> 02:13:31,770
regeneration,
rejuvenation.

2578
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:36,810
So the idea here is that iN that arch is
preserved all of the seeds,

2579
02:13:36,811 --> 02:13:41,130
the bIological diversity of the world 
that is now being erased from the planet

2580
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:43,350
by the waters of the flood,
the acacia.

2581
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:48,410
Is it related to the acacia tree or the 
case of bushes at the same sort of 

2582
02:13:48,410 --> 02:13:48,410
thing?
Yeah.

2583
02:13:48,410 --> 02:13:52,760
You know,
that's the same bush that they believe 

2584
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:53,970
was responsible for moses having the 
visions of god.

2585
02:13:54,890 --> 02:13:59,890
So what are they giving him the 10 
commandments because the acacia bushes 

2586
02:13:59,890 --> 02:14:01,460
rich and dimethyltryptamine.
Ah,

2587
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:05,940
the flaming bush,
the being symbolic of somehow or another

2588
02:14:05,941 --> 02:14:10,941
extracting the dmt from that,
smoking it or lighting it on fire.

2589
02:14:11,850 --> 02:14:15,120
And that being the transmission method 
for the dimethyltryptamine,

2590
02:14:15,121 --> 02:14:20,121
which of course is one of the most 
profound psychedelic experiences and 

2591
02:14:20,121 --> 02:14:22,950
gives people this feeling of being in 
contact with the divine.

2592
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:28,460
Now,
do you think it's any coincidence that 

2593
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:29,550
the freemasons have venerated the acacia
for hundreds of years?

2594
02:14:29,570 --> 02:14:31,320
It makes a lot of sense.
Makes a lot of sense,

2595
02:14:31,321 --> 02:14:32,140
doesn't it?
Yeah.

2596
02:14:32,430 --> 02:14:33,180
Yeah.
Well,

2597
02:14:33,181 --> 02:14:38,181
there's modern day scholars who are 
looking at the story of moses and 

2598
02:14:38,181 --> 02:14:40,110
connecting it to some sort of a 
psychedelic trip.

2599
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:42,530
Yeah.
Here is,

2600
02:14:42,890 --> 02:14:46,710
which is another thing that's slowly 
being exonerated today.

2601
02:14:46,711 --> 02:14:49,530
Those ideas are being vindicated today.
Yeah,

2602
02:14:49,531 --> 02:14:50,910
way that before,
you know,

2603
02:14:50,911 --> 02:14:55,911
you would say just a few decades ago 
that somehow or another moses was on 

2604
02:14:55,911 --> 02:14:55,911
drugs and I'm like,
get the fuck out of here.

2605
02:14:55,911 --> 02:14:57,360
Yeah.
I think people would just.

2606
02:14:57,430 --> 02:15:02,430
And any real,
legitimate sort of stories being 

2607
02:15:02,430 --> 02:15:07,251
connected to psychedelic drugs,
people would think of as being 

2608
02:15:07,251 --> 02:15:09,921
preposterous and now and now worn more 
accepted every day simply because the 

2609
02:15:10,111 --> 02:15:12,730
evidence has accumulated overwhelming 
the elephant there.

2610
02:15:12,731 --> 02:15:14,850
There's no question that in the llc and 
mysteries,

2611
02:15:14,851 --> 02:15:18,300
they were imbibing some type of a 
consciousness altering substance.

2612
02:15:18,301 --> 02:15:21,300
I think that there's no question during 
the mithraic mysteries also.

2613
02:15:21,330 --> 02:15:24,540
They were,
they don't know what that was though,

2614
02:15:24,541 --> 02:15:25,560
right?
Not exactly.

2615
02:15:25,561 --> 02:15:26,370
Unless you,
you know,

2616
02:15:26,371 --> 02:15:27,590
I think,
um,

2617
02:15:27,630 --> 02:15:32,630
who was it?
Maybe Albert Hoffman and a couple 

2618
02:15:32,630 --> 02:15:32,630
others,
they,

2619
02:15:32,630 --> 02:15:35,261
they,
they wrote a book in the seventies on 

2620
02:15:35,261 --> 02:15:35,580
the loc and mysteries where they were 
talking about that.

2621
02:15:35,581 --> 02:15:39,780
And I read it so long ago,
I've kind of forgotten what their,

2622
02:15:40,230 --> 02:15:45,230
what their final conclusion was,
but it was definitely that they were 

2623
02:15:45,230 --> 02:15:46,140
doing some type of a psychedelic potion 
will even soma.

2624
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:51,200
When you go back to the ancient hindus,
the soma being some sort of a mystery 

2625
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:53,820
concoction,
they don't know what it was,

2626
02:15:53,821 --> 02:15:57,830
but most likely had some sort of 
psychedelic properties to.

2627
02:15:57,850 --> 02:16:00,150
I don't know what it was.
They don't know exactly what.

2628
02:16:00,151 --> 02:16:04,950
It was amazing when you consider the 
fact that this stuff was so profound,

2629
02:16:04,951 --> 02:16:09,951
so important to them,
and now we don't even know what was in 

2630
02:16:09,951 --> 02:16:13,221
it and most likely some concoction with 
probably included psychedelic mushrooms.

2631
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:17,430
Yeah.
Well I'm convinced that one of the,

2632
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:21,180
one of the great boons to humankind is 
psychedelics.

2633
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:26,600
And it was a profound mistake to 
criminalize it when we should have 

2634
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:29,800
venerated as ancient cultures did and 
provided a context in which people could

2635
02:16:29,801 --> 02:16:31,750
do it with wisdom,
you know,

2636
02:16:31,751 --> 02:16:34,570
and propriety rather than driving it 
underground,

2637
02:16:34,571 --> 02:16:39,571
you know,
and turning it into a criminal 

2638
02:16:39,571 --> 02:16:41,191
enterprise that has been,
I think enormously had enormously 

2639
02:16:41,191 --> 02:16:42,280
destructive consequences for our society
by,

2640
02:16:42,340 --> 02:16:44,680
by criminalizing this for the last half 
century.

2641
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:46,000
Yeah,
most certainly.

2642
02:16:46,001 --> 02:16:48,610
And you can see the difference in the 
art of the 19 sixties,

2643
02:16:48,611 --> 02:16:53,611
especially when it comes to music,
the difference between the sixties and 

2644
02:16:53,611 --> 02:16:56,461
the seventies,
that shallow nature of a lot of the 

2645
02:16:56,461 --> 02:16:57,190
music that came out of the seven days in
the disco and all that stuff.

2646
02:16:57,340 --> 02:17:02,340
And then look at what was going on in 
the sixties with hendrix and jim 

2647
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:03,970
morrison,
most likely psychedelic related.

2648
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:05,230
Oh,
of course it was.

2649
02:17:05,400 --> 02:17:06,130
Yeah,
of course.

2650
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:07,750
Led zeppelin,
the beatles.

2651
02:17:08,110 --> 02:17:10,000
The profound change in the music of the 
beatles.

2652
02:17:10,001 --> 02:17:15,001
once they discovered lsd,
it inspired an enormous burst of 

2653
02:17:15,161 --> 02:17:17,390
creativity.
It's really interesting.

2654
02:17:17,410 --> 02:17:22,410
Then what we're seeing now is huge 
benefits in psychedelic therapy for 

2655
02:17:22,410 --> 02:17:24,150
people with posttraumatic stress 
disorder,

2656
02:17:24,151 --> 02:17:29,151
ice.
And it's out of war that we're finding 

2657
02:17:29,151 --> 02:17:32,680
these therapies for people that went to 
war and these therapies,

2658
02:17:32,681 --> 02:17:36,610
the best ones are psychedelics,
which is really amazing.

2659
02:17:36,611 --> 02:17:37,030
Well,
you know,

2660
02:17:37,031 --> 02:17:38,160
in my own case,
you know,

2661
02:17:38,220 --> 02:17:43,220
I basically went from being a juvenile 
delinquent to the quest for god in one 

2662
02:17:43,931 --> 02:17:48,931
weekend after my first basically.
So wow It was that,

2663
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:54,280
that quick.
A lot of people have at the same story.

2664
02:17:54,281 --> 02:17:56,440
I mean,
terence mckenna spoke of his,

2665
02:17:56,620 --> 02:17:59,080
uh,
one of his trips to the jungle,

2666
02:17:59,230 --> 02:18:01,150
being that he was this sort of 
narrative,

2667
02:18:01,151 --> 02:18:02,860
well,
just couldn't get it together.

2668
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:05,320
and then he came out of it,
the psychedelic shaman.

2669
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:08,110
I had this intense desire to spread the 
word.

2670
02:18:08,140 --> 02:18:09,550
yeah.
Yeah.

2671
02:18:09,950 --> 02:18:11,230
Yep.
So,

2672
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:16,500
yeah,
and I think we're definitely moving in 

2673
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:16,500
the right direction.
I just,

2674
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:16,570
it's of course,
you know,

2675
02:18:17,110 --> 02:18:18,460
for me,
I'm impatient.

2676
02:18:18,461 --> 02:18:23,461
I want to see you move a lot faster.
I want to see us just end this 

2677
02:18:23,461 --> 02:18:24,240
ridiculous drug war,
you know?

2678
02:18:24,310 --> 02:18:25,080
And,
and yeah,

2679
02:18:25,150 --> 02:18:26,890
of course there's going to be a downside
to it.

2680
02:18:26,891 --> 02:18:28,720
There's downsides to everything,
you know.

2681
02:18:28,740 --> 02:18:31,670
and,
but the upside is so substantial.

2682
02:18:31,700 --> 02:18:36,700
Upside is so substantial.
And the downside of it is minuscule 

2683
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:37,600
compared to the downside of the drug war
itself.

2684
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:40,960
Not only that,
how about the drugs that we already have

2685
02:18:40,961 --> 02:18:43,810
that are legal to the drugs that are 
sanctioned or the worst one?

2686
02:18:43,811 --> 02:18:44,830
Worst ones.
yeah.

2687
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:48,310
Just we're not going to have a drug free
society.

2688
02:18:48,310 --> 02:18:51,790
I've had Dr.
Carl Hart on the podcast who's an expert

2689
02:18:51,791 --> 02:18:56,791
in this and is written some pretty 
amazing stuff on it and one of the 

2690
02:18:56,791 --> 02:19:01,090
things he said is not only do we not 
want a drug free culture,

2691
02:19:01,210 --> 02:19:06,210
we've never had one.
No one has ever had an idea of a drug 

2692
02:19:06,210 --> 02:19:07,150
free culture.
They've never existed.

2693
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:11,890
Once people figured out a way to perturb
their normal states of conscious and the

2694
02:19:11,891 --> 02:19:16,891
benefits of that,
whether it's alcohol or psychedelics or 

2695
02:19:16,891 --> 02:19:16,990
whatever it's been.
Even yoga and meditation,

2696
02:19:16,991 --> 02:19:18,520
you're essentially,
you're,

2697
02:19:18,521 --> 02:19:21,130
you're,
you're stimulating indogenous drugs.

2698
02:19:21,131 --> 02:19:21,950
Yes.
Yes.

2699
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:22,350
And,
and,

2700
02:19:22,351 --> 02:19:23,380
and see,
here's the thing.

2701
02:19:23,590 --> 02:19:25,570
Somebody brought this up.
I don't remember who.

2702
02:19:25,571 --> 02:19:28,130
It might've been somebody like richard 
or something back

2703
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:29,600
in the day saying,
you know,

2704
02:19:29,810 --> 02:19:34,810
you can go.
You can embark on a quest for spiritual 

2705
02:19:34,810 --> 02:19:36,230
enlightenment in and mystical at one 
moment,

2706
02:19:36,260 --> 02:19:41,150
right through through this arduous 
program of yoga and meditation and in,

2707
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:43,700
in all of that,
and it'll take you years,

2708
02:19:44,060 --> 02:19:46,910
but who is going to embark upon such a 
program?

2709
02:19:46,911 --> 02:19:50,840
Not really knowing that the end of it is
this ecstatic,

2710
02:19:50,841 --> 02:19:53,720
mystical union with the god had.
Right?

2711
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:56,630
Well,
they said it basically.

2712
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:59,720
Nature's provided shortcuts so that you 
know,

2713
02:19:59,780 --> 02:20:03,830
we could actually see what the goal of 
it was and know that,

2714
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:09,010
yeah,
at the end of this process that might 

2715
02:20:09,010 --> 02:20:09,010
take you 10 years or five years or 
whatever,

2716
02:20:09,140 --> 02:20:14,140
depending on your dedication.
There is this all this experience of 

2717
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:18,520
your consciousness expanding into these 
ecstatic states agents of evolution as 

2718
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:21,050
it were,
and that's the thing that people,

2719
02:20:21,230 --> 02:20:25,290
I think universally feel from 
psychedelic experiences,

2720
02:20:25,291 --> 02:20:30,291
is that it allows you to get over a lot 
of these sort of built in instincts that

2721
02:20:31,941 --> 02:20:36,941
we have from our thousands of years of 
evolution and the the time that we were 

2722
02:20:37,701 --> 02:20:40,280
essentially living like wild animals.

2723
02:20:40,490 --> 02:20:45,490
those,
those genes are still in our system and 

2724
02:20:45,490 --> 02:20:49,211
we have all these ideas of paranoia.
And fear and ego and jealousy and all 

2725
02:20:52,191 --> 02:20:55,220
these different things that allowed us 
to be ultra competitive,

2726
02:20:55,221 --> 02:20:57,890
which allowed us to innovate at a faster
rate,

2727
02:20:58,100 --> 02:21:00,740
which allowed us to get to where we are 
in 2015.

2728
02:21:00,741 --> 02:21:05,330
But those things are kind of hampering 
us because we were outgrowing the monkey

2729
02:21:05,331 --> 02:21:06,590
body.
It's like,

2730
02:21:06,591 --> 02:21:08,980
you know,
if we're going to travel to um,

2731
02:21:09,490 --> 02:21:10,950
we wanted to travel to europe,
right?

2732
02:21:11,450 --> 02:21:16,450
You can't drive there in a car,
you can go drive from here to the east 

2733
02:21:16,450 --> 02:21:16,450
coast.
But once you get to the coastline,

2734
02:21:16,450 --> 02:21:18,530
you have to get out of the car and get 
into a different vehicle,

2735
02:21:18,980 --> 02:21:23,980
right?
Because if you keep driving in the same 

2736
02:21:23,980 --> 02:21:25,781
car,
you're going to go into the ocean and 

2737
02:21:25,781 --> 02:21:25,781
you're going to drown.
Right?

2738
02:21:25,781 --> 02:21:26,330
We're kind of liked that in the sense 
that,

2739
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:27,590
you know,
see,

2740
02:21:27,591 --> 02:21:30,470
I think that war was perhaps inevitable.

2741
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:33,320
You know this because it's embedded in 
our consciousness.

2742
02:21:33,321 --> 02:21:35,990
You see,
I just showed you hear evidence that the

2743
02:21:35,991 --> 02:21:39,440
human population crashed coming out of 
the younger dryas.

2744
02:21:39,890 --> 02:21:42,170
Well,
what's ironic is that after the,

2745
02:21:42,350 --> 02:21:45,710
after the ice age was over for about 
three or 4,000

2746
02:21:45,711 --> 02:21:48,350
years from 6,000
to about 9,000,

2747
02:21:48,470 --> 02:21:50,090
9,500
years ago,

2748
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:55,840
what we had was a period known as the 
climatic optimum by the scientists who 

2749
02:21:55,840 --> 02:22:00,621
have looked at it in which some of the 
estimates are that Global average 

2750
02:22:00,621 --> 02:22:02,030
climate might've been two to four 
degrees warmer than now.

2751
02:22:02,570 --> 02:22:07,570
What that meant was that you had a much 
longer growing season and anybody who 

2752
02:22:07,701 --> 02:22:12,701
doubts is please do your own research or
I can post all kinds of stuff online 

2753
02:22:12,701 --> 02:22:14,620
that anybody who's not immediately,
you know,

2754
02:22:17,720 --> 02:22:20,150
can't handle this.
This can kind of information.

2755
02:22:20,151 --> 02:22:25,151
Anybody who's open minded can actually 
go and do their homework and see that 

2756
02:22:25,151 --> 02:22:26,010
the climate climatic is well

2757
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:31,010
documented and for about three to 4,000
years basically we were living in an 

2758
02:22:32,221 --> 02:22:36,270
almost quasi parodies iol state.
Almost a garden of eden.

2759
02:22:36,271 --> 02:22:41,190
Like it was almost like after their 
traumatic birth of this modern age.

2760
02:22:41,191 --> 02:22:46,191
The holocene that we're in.
It's like nature just sort of was this 

2761
02:22:46,191 --> 02:22:50,750
nurturing environment.
It was during this period that humans 

2762
02:22:51,001 --> 02:22:56,001
were worshiping.
The earth in the form of this corpulent 

2763
02:22:56,001 --> 02:22:56,400
pregnant goddess,
right?

2764
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:59,760
It's been called the goddess 
civilization by maria gimbutas,

2765
02:22:59,820 --> 02:23:02,130
who was the archaeologist who did all of
this work.

2766
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:04,620
And what was interesting,
if you look into her work,

2767
02:23:04,621 --> 02:23:09,621
is that during this period of the,
of the early neolithic in the 

2768
02:23:09,621 --> 02:23:13,440
archaeological terminology,
there is no evidence of any warfare.

2769
02:23:14,010 --> 02:23:16,460
There's no evidence that people are 
looking at,

2770
02:23:16,470 --> 02:23:17,070
at the,
the,

2771
02:23:17,080 --> 02:23:17,780
the,
the,

2772
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:21,150
the carvings that people did,
that the artwork that people did,

2773
02:23:21,390 --> 02:23:24,810
looking at the communities,
there were not stockades like there were

2774
02:23:24,811 --> 02:23:25,230
later.

2775
02:23:25,470 --> 02:23:30,470
There was no evidence in the,
in the archaeological record of 

2776
02:23:30,650 --> 02:23:35,650
weaponization.
And it makes sense because in the 

2777
02:23:35,650 --> 02:23:38,790
aftermath of this extreme event that 
ended the ice age,

2778
02:23:38,791 --> 02:23:43,791
which you had was huge areas of the 
planet that were depopulated nature 

2779
02:23:44,521 --> 02:23:49,521
quickly begins to reclaim.
And what you now have is you have this 

2780
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:51,990
sort of,
this benign warmth.

2781
02:23:52,380 --> 02:23:56,520
We're growing seasons are months longer 
than now,

2782
02:23:56,790 --> 02:23:59,130
you know,
farming 14,

2783
02:23:59,131 --> 02:24:02,700
1500 feet higher in the mountains than 
is now possible.

2784
02:24:03,030 --> 02:24:04,440
Um,
you know,

2785
02:24:04,490 --> 02:24:05,780
uh,
you know,

2786
02:24:05,790 --> 02:24:10,790
long,
longer growing seasons and rapid 

2787
02:24:10,790 --> 02:24:11,760
expansion of population during this era.
This would have been the era,

2788
02:24:11,940 --> 02:24:16,940
you know,
think about what would the biblical 

2789
02:24:16,940 --> 02:24:16,940
injunction that you always gave to adam 
and eve,

2790
02:24:16,940 --> 02:24:19,110
what did he say?
Be fruitful and multiply,

2791
02:24:20,070 --> 02:24:23,100
replenish the earth,
and subdue it.

2792
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:24,990
Be fruitful and multiply.
Well.

2793
02:24:25,010 --> 02:24:28,170
If you've got a species hovering on the 
brink of extinction,

2794
02:24:28,171 --> 02:24:30,660
what's the most important thing that 
that species can do?

2795
02:24:31,290 --> 02:24:33,720
Lots of sex,
lots of reproduction,

2796
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:38,280
right?
In the context of those times,

2797
02:24:38,610 --> 02:24:42,720
it would've been very important for 
people to have lots of sex too quickly,

2798
02:24:42,721 --> 02:24:47,640
reestablish the viability of the human 
species because we were literally at now

2799
02:24:47,641 --> 02:24:50,100
appears hovering on the brink of 
extinction.

2800
02:24:50,101 --> 02:24:53,520
As were so many of the other large 
mammals of the planet,

2801
02:24:53,820 --> 02:24:57,650
right and nature gave us this interval,
this window,

2802
02:24:57,670 --> 02:25:01,560
three or 4,000
years of extremely mild climate,

2803
02:25:01,710 --> 02:25:03,690
right.
During this time,

2804
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:08,640
human population rapidly expanded and 
moved into these vacated habitats.

2805
02:25:09,630 --> 02:25:11,220
Around 6,000
years ago,

2806
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:16,820
the climate shifted.
What started was has been called by the 

2807
02:25:16,820 --> 02:25:20,960
paleoclimatologists,
the neo glaciation because the planet 

2808
02:25:20,971 --> 02:25:24,010
cooled a couple of degrees.
What happened?

2809
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:29,230
Agricultural habitats contracted.
The growing the,

2810
02:25:29,231 --> 02:25:29,740
the,
the,

2811
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:32,680
the elevation of viable agriculture came
down.

2812
02:25:33,190 --> 02:25:38,190
Okay,
now if you've got settled human 

2813
02:25:38,190 --> 02:25:39,370
communities that have become well 
established and living,

2814
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:44,540
uh,
in the context of that environment and 

2815
02:25:44,540 --> 02:25:45,550
now suddenly that environment changes,
right?

2816
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:51,120
Exactly.
Coincident with those environmental 

2817
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:53,581
changes around 6,000
years ago is when we see the first 

2818
02:25:53,581 --> 02:25:56,050
appearance of human conflict because now
with this changing climate,

2819
02:25:56,051 --> 02:26:01,051
you've got this disruption is major 
disruption in human communities that 

2820
02:26:01,051 --> 02:26:02,710
have been well established and 
proliferating for three or 4,000

2821
02:26:02,711 --> 02:26:04,570
years.
Think about,

2822
02:26:04,571 --> 02:26:09,571
you know,
if you're living in a community in your 

2823
02:26:09,571 --> 02:26:09,571
farming at 10,000
feet above sea level,

2824
02:26:09,940 --> 02:26:14,940
a smaller example,
a micro example would be the freezing 

2825
02:26:14,940 --> 02:26:18,361
out of the,
of the greenland colonists with the 

2826
02:26:18,361 --> 02:26:18,670
onset of the little ice age,
right?

2827
02:26:18,970 --> 02:26:23,860
For 500 years they were able to farm on 
the west coast of greenland and then the

2828
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:28,920
little ice age came on and they were 
frozen out and they tried to hang on as 

2829
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:31,780
long as they could,
but it kept getting harder and harder to

2830
02:26:31,781 --> 02:26:36,781
grow crops.
And then the climate declined further 

2831
02:26:36,781 --> 02:26:37,570
and the cis began to move south.

2832
02:26:37,900 --> 02:26:41,440
And the one who waited too long lost 
their opportunity.

2833
02:26:41,441 --> 02:26:46,441
Because once the cia said moved south at
cutoff the lanes so that they could 

2834
02:26:46,441 --> 02:26:49,480
actually evacuate greenland colonies 
completely went extinct.

2835
02:26:49,810 --> 02:26:53,080
Iceland itself was almost completely 
depopulated during this.

2836
02:26:53,830 --> 02:26:56,710
If we take that scenario,
expand it,

2837
02:26:56,711 --> 02:26:58,240
and go back 6,000
years ago,

2838
02:26:58,360 --> 02:27:01,720
we essentially see a very similar 
parallel phenomena going on,

2839
02:27:02,230 --> 02:27:06,880
and so when you figure for during it a 
civilization age of the goddess,

2840
02:27:06,881 --> 02:27:11,881
this,
this time that people were worshiping 

2841
02:27:11,881 --> 02:27:11,881
the earth in the form of this corpulent 
pregnant goddess,

2842
02:27:11,890 --> 02:27:13,780
this benign,
motherly,

2843
02:27:13,781 --> 02:27:17,140
nurturing goddess,
there was no reason for conflict because

2844
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:20,140
human populations were small,
they were isolated.

2845
02:27:20,230 --> 02:27:25,060
Resource base was enormous,
and then with the climate change,

2846
02:27:25,090 --> 02:27:30,090
what happened suddenly,
now human communities and populations 

2847
02:27:30,090 --> 02:27:32,200
are disrupted.
Migrations began happening.

2848
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:37,260
One group conflicts with another group,
and now we see the implements and the 

2849
02:27:37,451 --> 02:27:38,620
evidence of warfare.

2850
02:27:39,460 --> 02:27:42,040
If we go back to 10,000,
12,000

2851
02:27:42,041 --> 02:27:45,910
years ago,
clearly whatever happened then must have

2852
02:27:45,911 --> 02:27:48,370
been profoundly traumatic to the 
survivors.

2853
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:53,880
Think about this.
If you were the survivor of an event 

2854
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:57,480
that basically erased modern 
civilization and you were living in a 

2855
02:27:57,480 --> 02:28:01,201
small,
isolated banda survivors with no way to 

2856
02:28:01,201 --> 02:28:04,681
communicate with the rest of the world 
and no knowledge of whether there was 

2857
02:28:04,681 --> 02:28:05,740
even other survivors anywhere on the 
earth,

2858
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:08,420
it could profoundly affect your,
your,

2859
02:28:08,430 --> 02:28:09,640
your,
your consciousness,

2860
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:15,090
and that could be so profound that it's 
the imprint of those events could be so 

2861
02:28:15,341 --> 02:28:20,341
profound that it could be passed on for 
generations and and be lodged in our 

2862
02:28:21,741 --> 02:28:26,741
subconscious.
This idea of human conflict necessary 

2863
02:28:26,741 --> 02:28:30,130
for human survival into traumas that had
been visited upon our species by nature 

2864
02:28:30,130 --> 02:28:34,601
itself.
So I think that once we come to terms 

2865
02:28:34,881 --> 02:28:39,881
with the possibly origins of only until 
we come to terms with the origin of 

2866
02:28:39,881 --> 02:28:43,190
human conflict,
are we going to be able to purge it once

2867
02:28:43,191 --> 02:28:48,191
and for all and and realize that that 
the modern analog for that scenario was 

2868
02:28:51,141 --> 02:28:53,300
that coming out of that catastrophe.

2869
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:56,180
Abundant resources,
abundance,

2870
02:28:56,181 --> 02:28:57,950
habitat,
abundant space,

2871
02:28:58,670 --> 02:29:03,670
no conflict for territory or resources 
because the human population was 

2872
02:29:03,670 --> 02:29:05,840
limited.
What I suggest is that if people want to

2873
02:29:05,841 --> 02:29:08,990
understand the future of the human 
species,

2874
02:29:09,140 --> 02:29:13,880
go out on a crystal clear night and look
at sky.

2875
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:18,110
There is the future.
There's our potential future because the

2876
02:29:18,111 --> 02:29:23,111
scenario is that had been around since 
the 1970 [inaudible] show that 

2877
02:29:23,111 --> 02:29:24,530
everything that we're extracting now 
from the earth,

2878
02:29:25,010 --> 02:29:27,350
the minerals,
the precious metals,

2879
02:29:27,351 --> 02:29:31,400
the hydrocarbons,
it's all out there in infinite abundance

2880
02:29:31,460 --> 02:29:36,460
and it's basically just outside of our 
doorstep and we are as close now to 

2881
02:29:37,221 --> 02:29:42,221
being able to harvest the resources of 
the cosmic environment as we were from 

2882
02:29:42,221 --> 02:29:47,140
setting foot on the moon in 1960.
Do you think we've been visited before 

2883
02:29:47,140 --> 02:29:51,560
by something from other planets?
I think perhaps long,

2884
02:29:51,561 --> 02:29:56,561
long ago maybe,
but there's another scenario there that 

2885
02:29:56,561 --> 02:30:00,100
has been overlooked In all of the 
discussions about ufo is an aliens and 

2886
02:30:00,100 --> 02:30:02,030
at some point we'll talk about that some
point.

2887
02:30:02,630 --> 02:30:03,920
Yeah.
You tease.

2888
02:30:07,850 --> 02:30:09,800
Well,
you know,

2889
02:30:09,801 --> 02:30:13,310
it's the kind of thing where you kind of
need to lay out the case in,

2890
02:30:13,311 --> 02:30:18,311
in,
in what I like to do is basically 

2891
02:30:18,311 --> 02:30:21,371
present the evidence and see if whoever 
then draws the same conclusions from 

2892
02:30:21,741 --> 02:30:23,750
that evidence that I have.
So.

2893
02:30:24,190 --> 02:30:24,740
Okay.
Let me,

2894
02:30:24,770 --> 02:30:28,970
let me put it to you this way in what we
were talking about at the very beginning

2895
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:32,150
of this interview and in talking about 
7,000

2896
02:30:32,151 --> 02:30:37,151
generations of people and and the fact 
that in four or five generations we went

2897
02:30:37,161 --> 02:30:42,161
from horseback to rocket ships.
How many times in the last 7,000

2898
02:30:42,651 --> 02:30:45,020
years do you suppose that we could have 
done that?

2899
02:30:46,190 --> 02:30:51,190
To me,
it's not implausible that we could have 

2900
02:30:51,190 --> 02:30:52,871
achieved flight,
even interest in interplanetary flight 

2901
02:30:52,871 --> 02:30:54,930
more than once.
Just as we have.

2902
02:30:54,950 --> 02:30:55,700
I guess.
Think about it,

2903
02:30:56,150 --> 02:31:01,150
we have,
we have achieved interplanetary flight 

2904
02:31:01,150 --> 02:31:01,970
even though only manned expeditions to,
to near space,

2905
02:31:01,971 --> 02:31:05,360
but we're sending our satellites out 
beyond the solar system.

2906
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:07,700
All of this has come about in my 
lifetime,

2907
02:31:07,910 --> 02:31:08,690
right?
Totally.

2908
02:31:08,691 --> 02:31:10,840
In my life.
Tall since the 1958.

2909
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:13,520
My grandfather,
when he was a kid,

2910
02:31:13,550 --> 02:31:17,870
you know it was horses and a big point 
is that if we died off now,

2911
02:31:17,871 --> 02:31:19,530
if there's some sort of mass extinction 
event,

2912
02:31:19,531 --> 02:31:20,220
there'd be very

2913
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:22,890
little evidence of this space travel,
thousands of.

2914
02:31:22,930 --> 02:31:24,870
There'll be no evidence.
All the aluminum,

2915
02:31:24,871 --> 02:31:27,780
all the stuff that the rockets out of it
would all be gone,

2916
02:31:27,810 --> 02:31:29,310
right?
The earth would aBsorb it.

2917
02:31:29,610 --> 02:31:32,760
Now,
let's just consider as a wild,

2918
02:31:32,790 --> 02:31:37,790
outrageous working hypothesis that 
humans have been able to offload from 

2919
02:31:38,551 --> 02:31:42,870
the planet prior to that prior to the 
modern space age.

2920
02:31:43,470 --> 02:31:48,470
So at one point in time we went to mars,
there's probably somewhere a little 

2921
02:31:48,470 --> 02:31:50,250
closer than that.
It would've made sense like the moon,

2922
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:53,490
like the moon,
like we've been able to establish a base

2923
02:31:53,491 --> 02:31:54,720
on the moon.
Yeah.

2924
02:31:55,560 --> 02:31:57,240
Now this isn't.
Like I said,

2925
02:31:57,950 --> 02:32:02,010
great.
This is an outrageous heretic.

2926
02:32:02,050 --> 02:32:04,140
I'm what else?
You've done drugs,

2927
02:32:05,190 --> 02:32:07,620
man.
This is over.

2928
02:32:08,670 --> 02:32:12,360
It's time to lock me away.
Gag me,

2929
02:32:12,361 --> 02:32:13,340
muslim me.
In life,

2930
02:32:13,350 --> 02:32:16,140
we consider the fact that our 
civilization,

2931
02:32:16,200 --> 02:32:18,180
you know,
if all your theories are true,

2932
02:32:18,181 --> 02:32:22,590
which they most certainly appear to be,
our civilization has been rebooted as of

2933
02:32:22,591 --> 02:32:23,880
12,000
years ago.

2934
02:32:24,150 --> 02:32:27,270
Modern civilization emerges somewhere 
around 70,000

2935
02:32:27,271 --> 02:32:31,650
years ago and four point 6 billion years
of life on earth,

2936
02:32:31,651 --> 02:32:33,420
or excuse me,
of the life of the earth,

2937
02:32:33,421 --> 02:32:34,290
the earth,
existing,

2938
02:32:34,291 --> 02:32:36,540
and then life on earth being,
you know,

2939
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:40,890
in our form what few hundred thousand 
years,

2940
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:42,600
right?
In 100,000

2941
02:32:42,601 --> 02:32:44,000
years is all,
oh,

2942
02:32:44,480 --> 02:32:45,720
time.
That's 10,

2943
02:32:46,230 --> 02:32:51,230
10 events since the big impact 10 times.
But remember the greenland ice core 

2944
02:32:52,231 --> 02:32:53,370
graft and they showed you,
I mean,

2945
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:58,520
what you're seeing there is a dozen or 
more enormous events in the last 

2946
02:32:59,070 --> 02:33:00,720
quarter,
million years into time.

2947
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:03,810
Probably the human getting the oldest 
human skeleton,

2948
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:07,020
modern modern humans.
Skeleton is now dated to about 180,000

2949
02:33:07,021 --> 02:33:09,330
years.
How much earlier than that?

2950
02:33:09,360 --> 02:33:10,470
Where we,
I don't know,

2951
02:33:10,530 --> 02:33:14,720
but conservatively we can say 180,000
years at greenland ice core grafted,

2952
02:33:14,760 --> 02:33:17,460
I showed you,
it goes back 250,000.

2953
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:22,520
So the rig veda stories of the amanas 
and the flying crafts and all that could

2954
02:33:22,561 --> 02:33:26,310
actually have been based on real live 
objects,

2955
02:33:26,670 --> 02:33:30,300
real live spaceships that someone read 
the sumerian stories.

2956
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:32,520
What did they say in the wake of the 
flood?

2957
02:33:32,521 --> 02:33:35,040
It was so disastrous that what did the 
gods do?

2958
02:33:35,370 --> 02:33:39,210
They fled the earth and went to space.
It says right there in the myth itself,

2959
02:33:40,140 --> 02:33:41,190
since they left,
they went,

2960
02:33:41,220 --> 02:33:46,220
when they left the earth and went to the
heavens because what was going on on 

2961
02:33:46,220 --> 02:33:47,570
your earth was so traumatic.
It even freaked them out.

2962
02:33:48,480 --> 02:33:50,040
Read the story,
the gods,

2963
02:33:50,100 --> 02:33:53,260
the gods,
hanky and ian and nunan,

2964
02:33:53,380 --> 02:33:54,960
nerc,
don and the rest of.

2965
02:33:55,020 --> 02:34:00,020
What did you think of zechariah 
situation and is fantastical 

2966
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:05,000
translations of the sumerian texts 
dubious about some of his most are 

2967
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:09,981
right?
most people who are experts in the 

2968
02:34:09,981 --> 02:34:09,981
sumerian cuneiform.
Yeah.

2969
02:34:09,981 --> 02:34:11,670
I think that he was kind of cuckoo.
Cuckoo,

2970
02:34:11,850 --> 02:34:12,930
cuckoo.
Well,

2971
02:34:12,931 --> 02:34:17,931
but what's fascinating is there's so 
much that they absolutely understood 

2972
02:34:18,071 --> 02:34:21,640
that's really confusing.
Like they understood they had an ad,

2973
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:23,980
an accurate depiction of our solar 
system,

2974
02:34:23,981 --> 02:34:28,981
which included pluto,
which included all the planets and all 

2975
02:34:28,981 --> 02:34:30,190
the orbit in,
in,

2976
02:34:30,250 --> 02:34:32,230
in the correct,
you know,

2977
02:34:32,350 --> 02:34:37,350
relatively correct sizes on these clay 
tablets that they made nine thousand 

2978
02:34:39,670 --> 02:34:41,230
seven thousand dollars,
who knows how many thousand years ago,

2979
02:34:41,750 --> 02:34:42,220
you know?

2980
02:34:42,580 --> 02:34:43,720
Yeah.
I guess I'm,

2981
02:34:44,060 --> 02:34:49,060
I read some kitcheN and stuff years and 
years ago and at the time took it with a

2982
02:34:49,211 --> 02:34:51,730
grain of salt and subsequent to that,
you know,

2983
02:34:51,731 --> 02:34:53,740
after I've seen some of the critiques of
him,

2984
02:34:54,310 --> 02:34:57,240
you know,
I'm kind of in that category myself.

2985
02:34:57,241 --> 02:34:58,530
I'm thinking because he's,
you know,

2986
02:34:58,680 --> 02:35:00,120
his,
some of his translations are,

2987
02:35:00,290 --> 02:35:02,470
are dubious.
He made some leaps.

2988
02:35:02,800 --> 02:35:07,800
Sure.
But what they did discover what they 

2989
02:35:07,800 --> 02:35:10,531
have just,
it's so fascinating to me when you look 

2990
02:35:10,531 --> 02:35:13,501
at like the caduceus,
which very clearly resembles the double 

2991
02:35:13,501 --> 02:35:17,551
helix of dna and how it's closely 
associated with some of these images of 

2992
02:35:17,551 --> 02:35:21,700
larger beings holding little smaller 
people with tails.

2993
02:35:22,120 --> 02:35:25,750
Like what the fuck is that?
Like this idea of genetic engineering,

2994
02:35:25,780 --> 02:35:30,780
of taking lower primates and introducing
human or alien dna into these lower 

2995
02:35:32,411 --> 02:35:36,880
primates to create modern humans.
I don't know what to think about that.

2996
02:35:36,910 --> 02:35:41,910
It sounds ridiculous,
but if we found a planet like let's say 

2997
02:35:42,041 --> 02:35:45,570
we exist in this state right now,
and uh,

2998
02:35:45,580 --> 02:35:46,750
we,
uh,

2999
02:35:46,870 --> 02:35:51,870
we evolve without getting hit in the 
head by a big rock from space for 

3000
02:35:51,870 --> 02:35:53,890
another thousand years or another 10,000
years.

3001
02:35:53,891 --> 02:35:57,580
Let's get really fucking crazy.
Just imagine how far we could come if we

3002
02:35:57,581 --> 02:35:59,440
don't blow ourselves up.
We don't.

3003
02:35:59,500 --> 02:36:03,040
Yellowstone doesn't explode.
We live another 10,000

3004
02:36:03,041 --> 02:36:08,041
years and we jet off into the cosmos and
find some planet with a bunch of dumb 

3005
02:36:08,041 --> 02:36:12,781
monkeys on it.
You don't think we would splice our dna 

3006
02:36:12,781 --> 02:36:12,781
into those dumb monkeys just to say,
listen,

3007
02:36:12,781 --> 02:36:15,900
I think you guys could do better.
You could be like us.

3008
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:18,160
We're going to give you a little bump.
We know what's coming.

3009
02:36:18,190 --> 02:36:23,190
If you guys keep going along this way,
you could get to where we are in the 

3010
02:36:23,190 --> 02:36:25,510
million plus years.
Weakened a little injection maybe.

3011
02:36:25,880 --> 02:36:27,610
How about a scenario like this?
Okay,

3012
02:36:28,270 --> 02:36:33,270
well from our superior perspective,
we know that you guys down here are 

3013
02:36:33,270 --> 02:36:36,801
living on a vulnerable planet that's 
going to be habits to ask kicked every 

3014
02:36:36,801 --> 02:36:40,591
so often,
so we're going to do something to 

3015
02:36:40,591 --> 02:36:42,820
accelerate your evolution a bit so that 
perhaps you can become a little bit more

3016
02:36:42,821 --> 02:36:47,821
intelligent and figure this out.
We're going to leave some clues behind 

3017
02:36:47,821 --> 02:36:51,361
for you and then we're going to leave it
in your hands to basically redeem to 

3018
02:36:52,600 --> 02:36:57,600
redeem the planet.
It's amazing how often people just like 

3019
02:36:57,600 --> 02:36:58,450
completely dismissed any ideas like 
that,

3020
02:36:58,451 --> 02:37:03,451
but yet we clearly are.
We're very advanced in compared to life 

3021
02:37:04,421 --> 02:37:09,421
on earth,
but clearly we're advancing into the 

3022
02:37:09,421 --> 02:37:12,010
solar system at the very least with 
robots.

3023
02:37:12,370 --> 02:37:12,840
You know,
we,

3024
02:37:12,841 --> 02:37:15,980
we haven't really been doing man space 
trips

3025
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:20,980
anymore,
but we're sending a lot of fucking 

3026
02:37:20,980 --> 02:37:20,980
robots.
Yeah,

3027
02:37:20,980 --> 02:37:24,520
we're sending satellites,
we're sending all these things to go 

3028
02:37:24,520 --> 02:37:28,811
around other planets and take images.
Were sending robots that land on mars to

3029
02:37:29,001 --> 02:37:34,001
rove around and take photos and soil 
samples and send information back 

3030
02:37:34,641 --> 02:37:36,200
through the sky to earth.
I mean,

3031
02:37:36,590 --> 02:37:39,590
that's pretty.
It is fantastic stuff.

3032
02:37:39,620 --> 02:37:42,440
Well,
imagine if you tried to describe to this

3033
02:37:42,500 --> 02:37:45,500
this to somebody 100 years ago,
they'd go get outta here.

3034
02:37:45,860 --> 02:37:50,860
This is outrageous.
I don't even want to hear such 

3035
02:37:50,860 --> 02:37:51,260
ridiculous,
but like you just said,

3036
02:37:51,590 --> 02:37:54,680
considering the pace of change over the 
last century,

3037
02:37:55,090 --> 02:37:56,270
you know,
given us a century ago,

3038
02:37:56,271 --> 02:37:59,920
there was no airline industry,
but of course the thing was if you know,

3039
02:37:59,921 --> 02:38:04,921
if you had the government bureaucracies 
like you like you have now back then 

3040
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:10,000
orville and wilbur would have never been
able to test their flights because some 

3041
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,151
government bureaucrat would have been 
out there saying you don't have the 

3042
02:38:13,151 --> 02:38:13,151
proper permits to do this.

3043
02:38:13,151 --> 02:38:13,900
And right now that's,
You know,

3044
02:38:14,150 --> 02:38:16,550
one of the big obstacles is that we've 
gotten.

3045
02:38:16,551 --> 02:38:19,280
We've got these top heavy political 
systems that are really,

3046
02:38:19,281 --> 02:38:22,970
I think really encumbering the creative 
process,

3047
02:38:22,971 --> 02:38:26,770
the evolutionary process.
That's why I'm such a big supporter of,

3048
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:30,890
of basically freedom in getting back to 
the idea of,

3049
02:38:30,930 --> 02:38:34,760
of individual liberty.
Because think the upside of people being

3050
02:38:34,761 --> 02:38:35,990
free.
Yeah,

3051
02:38:35,991 --> 02:38:39,020
of course there's a cost to freedom and 
there's going to be a downside to it.

3052
02:38:39,021 --> 02:38:40,760
But the upside,
I think,

3053
02:38:40,820 --> 02:38:45,820
again,
is so much greater than the downside 

3054
02:38:45,820 --> 02:38:46,700
that led to what the internet is showing
the internet is.

3055
02:38:46,870 --> 02:38:48,860
It represents freedom.
The free,

3056
02:38:49,130 --> 02:38:51,740
the ability to freely distribute 
information.

3057
02:38:52,130 --> 02:38:54,620
This show itself would have never 
existed.

3058
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:58,760
This podcast could not have existed 
without something like the internet.

3059
02:38:58,761 --> 02:39:01,880
No one would have ever given me a show.
no one would ever like said,

3060
02:39:01,881 --> 02:39:06,881
yeah,
go talk to this guy from Georgia for 

3061
02:39:06,881 --> 02:39:07,190
three hours about asteroid impacts.

3062
02:39:07,220 --> 02:39:08,470
People will like it,
you know,

3063
02:39:08,870 --> 02:39:10,640
get outta here.
Get the fuck out of here.

3064
02:39:10,670 --> 02:39:11,750
Actually,
I'm from Minnesota.

3065
02:39:11,780 --> 02:39:12,950
Well,
I mean you live there,

3066
02:39:13,300 --> 02:39:18,300
you know.
but it's just the whole idea is that 

3067
02:39:18,300 --> 02:39:20,060
freedom allows people to innovate at a 
much quicker pace.

3068
02:39:20,480 --> 02:39:23,570
It allows negative things too.
But so does life itself.

3069
02:39:23,571 --> 02:39:28,571
there's,
there's more of a chance of negative 

3070
02:39:28,571 --> 02:39:28,610
things.
If things are controlled,

3071
02:39:28,970 --> 02:39:33,410
if things are locked down and innovation
goes,

3072
02:39:33,640 --> 02:39:36,740
where does it goes right out in my own 
personal sphere,

3073
02:39:36,741 --> 02:39:39,960
like 20 years,
like I'm building a project right now in

3074
02:39:39,980 --> 02:39:44,980
atlanta.
Took me six months and nine trips down 

3075
02:39:44,980 --> 02:39:48,470
to city hall to get permission from the 
bureaucrats to do a small project,

3076
02:39:48,530 --> 02:39:53,530
which 20 years ago I could have gotten 
permission in an hour to 20 years before

3077
02:39:54,021 --> 02:39:59,021
that I didn't even would have been,
would not have even needed permission 

3078
02:39:59,021 --> 02:39:59,021
from anybody,
you know,

3079
02:39:59,021 --> 02:40:00,050
oh,
you've got your own house,

3080
02:40:00,051 --> 02:40:02,000
you want to do this,
your neighbors don't care.

3081
02:40:02,300 --> 02:40:03,210
We'll do it.
See,

3082
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:09,080
so this is what my experience there.
Multiply that by millions across the 

3083
02:40:09,471 --> 02:40:10,200
board,
you know,

3084
02:40:10,250 --> 02:40:11,960
it's like,
you know,

3085
02:40:11,961 --> 02:40:13,410
it's going to get to the point where,
you know,

3086
02:40:13,411 --> 02:40:14,130
can we,
do

3087
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:18,600
we dare breathe out without a permit 
because we're exhaling carbon dioxide,

3088
02:40:19,530 --> 02:40:20,910
you know?
Right.

3089
02:40:21,270 --> 02:40:21,960
So,
um,

3090
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:23,580
yeah,
I just,

3091
02:40:23,610 --> 02:40:28,610
I,
I think that a couple of things need to 

3092
02:40:28,610 --> 02:40:28,610
happen.
One,

3093
02:40:28,610 --> 02:40:30,030
we need to really get back to the idea 
and America,

3094
02:40:30,031 --> 02:40:33,840
that's the great dream and vision of 
America was that this was supposed to be

3095
02:40:33,841 --> 02:40:38,130
the home of freedom on planet earth.
your bureaucracy is pretty disgusting,

3096
02:40:38,131 --> 02:40:43,131
but it's also,
I feel like sometimes we need some 

3097
02:40:43,131 --> 02:40:44,520
resistance in order to facilitate 
action.

3098
02:40:44,550 --> 02:40:45,780
Some resistance.
Yeah.

3099
02:40:45,781 --> 02:40:50,781
And some resistance.
Sometimes gives us this real desire to 

3100
02:40:50,781 --> 02:40:53,430
overcome that resistance,
which makes innovation.

3101
02:40:53,510 --> 02:40:54,290
Yeah,
you know,

3102
02:40:54,300 --> 02:40:59,250
and that might be one of the things that
we're experiencing with this new culture

3103
02:40:59,251 --> 02:41:03,300
that's emerging from the internet.
It's kind of emerging in response to the

3104
02:41:03,301 --> 02:41:08,301
resistance that we received from mean 
going back to psychedelics from the 

3105
02:41:08,551 --> 02:41:13,551
sixties and seventies,
seventies into the eighties and the 

3106
02:41:13,551 --> 02:41:13,551
nineties.

3107
02:41:13,551 --> 02:41:16,970
The internet emerges and the internet is
causing this big pushback on all of the 

3108
02:41:17,431 --> 02:41:21,510
archaic ideas of being promoted during 
those dark decades.

3109
02:41:22,950 --> 02:41:24,900
Yeah,
and I totally agree with you.

3110
02:41:24,901 --> 02:41:26,460
I mean without some resist.
I mean,

3111
02:41:26,940 --> 02:41:28,830
after all,
I mean if there's no resistance,

3112
02:41:28,831 --> 02:41:29,120
you know,
we.

3113
02:41:29,160 --> 02:41:30,960
We're going to basically turn it into 
slugs.

3114
02:41:31,020 --> 02:41:32,250
We turned the couch,
potatoes,

3115
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:34,170
we turned the couch with the lazy.
We're lazy.

3116
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:39,560
Yeah.
It's very rare that human beings by 

3117
02:41:39,560 --> 02:41:41,811
default are ambitious.
It's like in response to something like 

3118
02:41:41,811 --> 02:41:46,640
one of the worst things you could do to 
a kid is give the kid everything they 

3119
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:50,661
want and not have them work.
Though they'd never develop any 

3120
02:41:50,661 --> 02:41:52,590
instincts to work towards things.
They never develop any,

3121
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:57,800
any instincts to recognize that there's 
a benefit to struggling and being 

3122
02:41:58,291 --> 02:42:03,291
uncomfortable and that the rewards when,
when you have a hard day's work and a 

3123
02:42:04,200 --> 02:42:06,630
job completed,
that you feel satisfied,

3124
02:42:06,631 --> 02:42:09,420
but then the beer tastes so much better,
so much better.

3125
02:42:09,960 --> 02:42:11,880
The jewish cabela's have a term for 
that,

3126
02:42:11,881 --> 02:42:16,881
which I can't remember,
but it translates as the bread of shame 

3127
02:42:16,881 --> 02:42:20,120
and it's like the bread of shame is the 
bread you get that you didn't really 

3128
02:42:20,120 --> 02:42:20,120
have to work for.
You didn't have to struggle,

3129
02:42:20,120 --> 02:42:21,810
you didn't have to put forward any 
effort.

3130
02:42:21,811 --> 02:42:23,780
It's just given to you,
you know,

3131
02:42:24,090 --> 02:42:24,580
and,
and,

3132
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:25,350
and,
you know,

3133
02:42:25,351 --> 02:42:30,330
it's like one of the,
the stories that kind of goes along with

3134
02:42:30,331 --> 02:42:31,840
presenting that as,
you know,

3135
02:42:31,900 --> 02:42:32,540
the,
the,

3136
02:42:32,900 --> 02:42:35,790
the man who builds up this great 
business empire,

3137
02:42:35,791 --> 02:42:37,970
you know,
and then you know,

3138
02:42:38,070 --> 02:42:43,070
he's getting ready to retire and he 
wants to pass it onto his son and he 

3139
02:42:43,070 --> 02:42:43,070
says,
you know,

3140
02:42:43,070 --> 02:42:46,110
come in and I'm going to make you ceo of
my business empire in the hole.

3141
02:42:46,170 --> 02:42:47,430
You're going to be Able to run the whole
thing.

3142
02:42:47,431 --> 02:42:48,150
And the son says,
no,

3143
02:42:48,151 --> 02:42:48,990
thanks.
I don't want,

3144
02:42:48,991 --> 02:42:49,380
and he goes,
well,

3145
02:42:49,381 --> 02:42:50,790
what do you mean?
He says,

3146
02:42:50,791 --> 02:42:55,791
well,
let me start at the bottom and work my 

3147
02:42:55,791 --> 02:42:57,000
way up and earn that position and it's 
going to mean a whole lot more to me and

3148
02:42:57,001 --> 02:43:02,001
I'm going to be a hell of a lot more 
effective in that position and if it's 

3149
02:43:02,001 --> 02:43:05,211
just dumped in my lap.
It's just so rare that anybody has that 

3150
02:43:05,211 --> 02:43:07,260
mentality though most people would take 
the easy road every single time.

3151
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:10,140
Well,
and that is to the consternation,

3152
02:43:10,141 --> 02:43:12,040
I think of our who didn't look at it

3153
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:15,040
that way.
You know the people that came across the

3154
02:43:15,041 --> 02:43:17,200
ocean,
it great hardship,

3155
02:43:17,201 --> 02:43:22,201
didn't look at it that way and I think 
that they would be pretty much rolling 

3156
02:43:22,201 --> 02:43:24,070
in their graves if they could see.
You know what's basically,

3157
02:43:24,100 --> 02:43:29,100
oh well we'll let you.
We'll just let the government take care 

3158
02:43:29,100 --> 02:43:31,531
of us.
I don't have to get a job because the 

3159
02:43:31,531 --> 02:43:34,081
government's going to take care of us,
but they would also look at our 

3160
02:43:34,081 --> 02:43:34,081
computers and go,
holy shit,

3161
02:43:34,081 --> 02:43:35,270
you guys have figured some thIngs out.
God.

3162
02:43:35,710 --> 02:43:36,460
Wait a minute,
hold on.

3163
02:43:36,461 --> 02:43:39,520
You asked a question to your phone and 
it gives you the answer.

3164
02:43:40,340 --> 02:43:45,340
I mean,
they never even thought about that on 

3165
02:43:45,340 --> 02:43:46,981
star trek and and see what that does is 
it shows there's 30 these parallel 

3166
02:43:46,981 --> 02:43:47,710
trends that are,
that are happening,

3167
02:43:47,770 --> 02:43:48,670
you know,
so yeah,

3168
02:43:48,671 --> 02:43:49,280
I'm,
I'm,

3169
02:43:49,710 --> 02:43:52,180
I'm,
that's why I tend to be more optimistic.

3170
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:53,460
I'm not a pessimist.
I,

3171
02:43:53,461 --> 02:43:56,080
I have great hopes for her future.
I do too.

3172
02:43:56,081 --> 02:44:01,081
And people give me a hard time for it.
Sometimes you think I'm unrealistic or 

3173
02:44:01,081 --> 02:44:04,810
the hippie side of me.
Hippie ideology as well.

3174
02:44:05,620 --> 02:44:09,010
The sacred geometry,
sacred geometry name.

3175
02:44:09,011 --> 02:44:11,590
Like why did you choose that as the name
for your website?

3176
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:16,680
Well,
because at the time I was looking at 

3177
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:19,500
there was so much interest and because I
saw it as a venue for putting 

3178
02:44:19,811 --> 02:44:23,650
information out there about that and 
showing some of the amazing correlations

3179
02:44:23,651 --> 02:44:28,651
and linkages between the subject of 
geometry and so many of these other 

3180
02:44:29,321 --> 02:44:30,040
things.
like I said,

3181
02:44:30,041 --> 02:44:31,750
you know,
the mayan temples,

3182
02:44:31,751 --> 02:44:36,751
egyptian structures in helping,
using that as a key to decipher or 

3183
02:44:37,061 --> 02:44:42,061
decode these messages that have been 
have been embodied in architecture.

3184
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:45,710
It's the key.
It's a master,

3185
02:44:45,720 --> 02:44:48,760
it's one of the master keys to decoding 
the archaic,

3186
02:44:48,761 --> 02:44:49,900
true wisdom tradition.

3187
02:44:49,990 --> 02:44:52,720
There's no question and geometry 
pervades everything.

3188
02:44:52,780 --> 02:44:55,000
I mean geometry pervades,
you know,

3189
02:44:55,300 --> 02:45:00,300
we can actually,
I can show you now studies that have 

3190
02:45:00,300 --> 02:45:00,640
shown that the exact architecture of the
solar system,

3191
02:45:00,641 --> 02:45:04,480
if you change it even a little Bit,
none of this could happen,

3192
02:45:04,680 --> 02:45:06,100
you know,
because as it is now,

3193
02:45:06,101 --> 02:45:11,101
you have this great reservoir of 
comments outside the orbit of neptune 

3194
02:45:11,101 --> 02:45:14,200
called the kuyper disk right at the 
inside of that,

3195
02:45:14,201 --> 02:45:16,360
an inner perimeter of that disk of 
comets,

3196
02:45:17,490 --> 02:45:20,710
commentary in stable condition.
In other words,

3197
02:45:20,950 --> 02:45:23,860
it doesn't take much to perturb them 
from that position,

3198
02:45:24,550 --> 02:45:27,370
but at the same tIme there isn't much 
there to perturb them,

3199
02:45:27,400 --> 02:45:30,580
so they generally are just slowly 
orbiting the sun.

3200
02:45:31,290 --> 02:45:36,290
Well,
what happens is conjunctions of the 

3201
02:45:36,290 --> 02:45:38,670
outer planets,
uranus and neptune primarily the 

3202
02:45:38,670 --> 02:45:42,181
combined gravitational forces exerted on
the inner part of the kuyper disk or 

3203
02:45:42,181 --> 02:45:46,201
enough to dislodge comments and send 
them either either the gravity effect.

3204
02:45:46,540 --> 02:45:48,910
Think of this,
if you've got a gravity effect,

3205
02:45:48,911 --> 02:45:51,520
polling on something from behind and 
it's moving this way,

3206
02:45:51,521 --> 02:45:53,680
it's going to act as a breaking 
mechanism.

3207
02:45:53,950 --> 02:45:58,950
If it's a head in drawing on it,
it's going to act as an accelerating 

3208
02:45:58,950 --> 02:46:02,611
mechanism,
so if you accelerate one of these 

3209
02:46:02,611 --> 02:46:03,100
objects,
it moves out further from the sun.

3210
02:46:03,340 --> 02:46:06,670
If you decelerate it,
it moves in closer to the sun.

3211
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:12,240
What happens is is that the conjunction 
of the outer planets can move these 

3212
02:46:12,240 --> 02:46:17,111
comments inside the the become within 
the sphere of influence of the planets 

3213
02:46:17,360 --> 02:46:22,360
and it just so happens in an 
astrophysicist have worked out the 

3214
02:46:22,360 --> 02:46:26,321
mathematics of it,
that the masses and the spacing of the 

3215
02:46:26,321 --> 02:46:26,930
four great outer planets,
jupiter,

3216
02:46:26,931 --> 02:46:27,740
saturn,
uranus,

3217
02:46:27,741 --> 02:46:32,741
and neptune are exactly what they need 
to be to transport comments from the 

3218
02:46:33,321 --> 02:46:38,321
kuyper disk to the inner solar system,
and if you change that even a little 

3219
02:46:38,321 --> 02:46:39,020
bit,
you would lose this.

3220
02:46:39,020 --> 02:46:44,020
They've referred to it as the the bucket
mechanism or the like a bucket handoff.

3221
02:46:46,250 --> 02:46:51,250
Each planet.
We'll hand off the comet to the next 

3222
02:46:51,250 --> 02:46:51,250
one,
and then when it gets to jupiter,

3223
02:46:51,250 --> 02:46:52,190
the big one,
like you said earlier,

3224
02:46:52,580 --> 02:46:57,580
jupiter is either going to accelerate it
and throw it back out or it's going to 

3225
02:46:57,580 --> 02:46:58,340
decelerate it and send it in towards the
sun.

3226
02:46:58,341 --> 02:47:03,341
Work becomes an earth crosser where it 
begins to desegregate and into process,

3227
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:07,880
fertilize the earth with its 
constituents,

3228
02:47:08,180 --> 02:47:13,010
which we now know are all kinds of 
interesting and exotic materials,

3229
02:47:13,730 --> 02:47:17,290
so if it turns out,
and it almost certainly will in terms of

3230
02:47:17,340 --> 02:47:22,340
the panspermia idea that that life was 
originated on earth by comments that you

3231
02:47:23,331 --> 02:47:25,580
had to have an environment that was 
conducive.

3232
02:47:25,690 --> 02:47:30,690
You had to have this matrix of 
environmental conditions that if were 

3233
02:47:30,690 --> 02:47:33,941
altered slightly,
would not allow the proliferation of 

3234
02:47:33,941 --> 02:47:33,941
higher life.

3235
02:47:33,941 --> 02:47:36,290
You now have the introduction of 
cometary material into that.

3236
02:47:36,350 --> 02:47:41,350
Well,
if the architecture of the outer solar 

3237
02:47:41,350 --> 02:47:41,810
system was not exactly lined up into 
geometry that it is,

3238
02:47:42,470 --> 02:47:47,470
then you would never have that delivery 
of the organics and the volatiles from 

3239
02:47:47,470 --> 02:47:48,200
the comet.
It's Backed.

3240
02:47:48,201 --> 02:47:53,201
It's likely that the oceans,
that the hydrosphere originated from 

3241
02:47:53,201 --> 02:47:55,550
space without the oceans,
where would life on earth be?

3242
02:47:55,640 --> 02:47:58,430
You see now here's where it gets 
interesting.

3243
02:47:58,850 --> 02:48:03,740
The architecture of the solar system is 
what's condensed and embodied within the

3244
02:48:03,741 --> 02:48:08,360
sacred architecture of old,
so they've taken that those proportion,

3245
02:48:08,361 --> 02:48:12,590
however that got there,
whether they knew it directly or on some

3246
02:48:12,650 --> 02:48:17,650
subconscious level and incorporated that
into the designs and the proportions of 

3247
02:48:17,650 --> 02:48:19,790
the ancient sacred structures.
It's there.

3248
02:48:20,210 --> 02:48:25,210
Basically the model of the holy city,
the new jerusalem is described in the 

3249
02:48:25,210 --> 02:48:29,740
book of revelations is basically a model
of the solar system architecture,

3250
02:48:30,710 --> 02:48:33,560
so it abides by bodes law.

3251
02:48:33,650 --> 02:48:35,570
Is that what it is?
Yes.

3252
02:48:35,660 --> 02:48:37,700
I think it's bid day.
I think that's how you say it,

3253
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:40,070
but god,
he would just be,

3254
02:48:40,071 --> 02:48:40,460
oh,
d,

3255
02:48:40,461 --> 02:48:41,990
e,
b o d o.

3256
02:48:41,991 --> 02:48:46,991
It's bowed day and I've only seen it 
written and the lobbying that the size 

3257
02:48:48,711 --> 02:48:53,711
and mass of a planet allows you to 
extrapolate and find out how big and far

3258
02:48:55,101 --> 02:48:58,130
away the next planet would be,
and so yeah,

3259
02:48:58,550 --> 02:49:01,640
it shows up that one of the intervals 
within that sequences,

3260
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:03,910
for example,
where the asteroid belt is [inaudible],

3261
02:49:03,980 --> 02:49:05,990
there's no planet there there,
but there's an asteroid,

3262
02:49:06,020 --> 02:49:08,880
right,
and that's of coincides with the ancient

3263
02:49:08,881 --> 02:49:13,881
sumerian myth of the creation of earth 
being an impact that there was an also 

3264
02:49:14,490 --> 02:49:18,390
earth and earth to.
They know that earth was at one point in

3265
02:49:18,391 --> 02:49:22,650
time different and it was impacted and 
that's also what created the moon,

3266
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:23,670
right?
Yeah.

3267
02:49:23,820 --> 02:49:26,130
Well that's,
that's the theory about the moon,

3268
02:49:26,131 --> 02:49:31,131
but the moon,
the moon is really something we could 

3269
02:49:31,131 --> 02:49:34,851
talk about for the next hour and we can 
save that for a future broadcast,

3270
02:49:35,521 --> 02:49:40,521
but the moon is really one of the grand 
symbols of the great mysteries with a 

3271
02:49:40,521 --> 02:49:41,010
capital lamp.

3272
02:49:41,010 --> 02:49:43,710
No question.
And it's right there every night.

3273
02:49:43,711 --> 02:49:44,160
I mean,
right now,

3274
02:49:44,161 --> 02:49:47,370
I think we're one day away from the full
moon right now as we're sitting here,

3275
02:49:47,371 --> 02:49:52,371
and I would highly recommend that 
anybody listening to this go out and 

3276
02:49:52,371 --> 02:49:56,241
begin contemplating the moon unless 
you're afraid of werewolf's unless 

3277
02:49:56,241 --> 02:50:00,321
you're afraid of where,
unless you're afraid of becoming 

3278
02:50:00,321 --> 02:50:01,600
transformed into a werewolf.
Um,

3279
02:50:02,160 --> 02:50:03,240
yeah.
So the,

3280
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:08,100
the.
How is jerusalem designed representation

3281
02:50:08,550 --> 02:50:11,420
as a representation of the solar system?
Uh,

3282
02:50:11,490 --> 02:50:12,490
well,
the,

3283
02:50:12,520 --> 02:50:14,730
the,
the hypothetical jerusalem,

3284
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:19,380
the new jerusalem,
well describes this layout.

3285
02:50:21,090 --> 02:50:23,660
It gets complex.
And again,

3286
02:50:24,120 --> 02:50:29,120
when I show this to people,
I usually rely on a lot of graphs and 

3287
02:50:29,120 --> 02:50:31,740
images and reproductions,
geometric diagrams and so on.

3288
02:50:32,220 --> 02:50:34,770
But basically it's describing tHe city 
lies four square,

3289
02:50:34,771 --> 02:50:39,771
the length,
the height and the breadth of it or 

3290
02:50:39,771 --> 02:50:39,771
equal 12,000
furlongs.

3291
02:50:39,771 --> 02:50:41,820
And there's a walgreens and high 144 
cubits according to the measure of a man

3292
02:50:41,821 --> 02:50:42,900
that is of the angel.

3293
02:50:43,590 --> 02:50:45,390
And then it goes on to describe other 
things,

3294
02:50:45,391 --> 02:50:49,560
but it's when you begin to begin to do 
the analysis of these numbers,

3295
02:50:49,561 --> 02:50:52,780
you discover it.
It opens up this whole world of,

3296
02:50:52,800 --> 02:50:57,390
of numerical symbolism.
the 12,000

3297
02:50:57,391 --> 02:50:58,470
furlongs you know,
how,

3298
02:50:58,471 --> 02:50:58,860
how much,
uh,

3299
02:50:58,861 --> 02:51:02,130
furlong is no a long.
It's one eighth of a mile.

3300
02:51:02,131 --> 02:51:07,131
It still exists.
It's in very ancient unit of 

3301
02:51:07,131 --> 02:51:07,131
measurement.
Still exists.

3302
02:51:07,131 --> 02:51:07,980
It's used in horse racing.
That's the one place that I know of.

3303
02:51:07,981 --> 02:51:12,981
It's still exists.
One eighth of a mile at 660 feet right 

3304
02:51:12,981 --> 02:51:14,280
now.
If you were to take the earth,

3305
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:16,210
the earth,
you know,

3306
02:51:16,230 --> 02:51:18,690
it's an oblique spheroid.
It spins on its axis,

3307
02:51:18,691 --> 02:51:22,470
so it bulges towards the equator,
shrinks towards the polar axis.

3308
02:51:22,471 --> 02:51:26,070
So the difference is about 7,900
miles at the polar axis,

3309
02:51:26,400 --> 02:51:30,030
about 7,926
miles at the equatorial access.

3310
02:51:30,480 --> 02:51:34,170
But if you were to take a perfect sphere
with the same area,

3311
02:51:34,171 --> 02:51:39,171
surface area is the earth actually has 
that sphere would be 7,920

3312
02:51:39,361 --> 02:51:44,361
miles in diameter.
Now that number 797920th.

3313
02:51:45,260 --> 02:51:48,330
A very interesting number because for 
one thing,

3314
02:51:48,840 --> 02:51:52,500
if we look at a furlong furlong is 660 
feet.

3315
02:51:53,190 --> 02:51:56,360
So I'm putting 660.
Why don't you take that calculated?

3316
02:51:56,370 --> 02:51:57,350
Okay?
Okay.

3317
02:51:57,810 --> 02:52:02,810
Now that's a furlong 660 feet.
Convert that to inches by going times 12

3318
02:52:04,470 --> 02:52:05,950
times times 12,

3319
02:52:06,240 --> 02:52:07,540
one slash two.
Okay,

3320
02:52:07,750 --> 02:52:11,950
and equals equals seven.
Nine,

3321
02:52:11,980 --> 02:52:13,600
two zero.
There it is.

3322
02:52:14,020 --> 02:52:16,780
Diameter of the earth and miles that I 
just said,

3323
02:52:16,990 --> 02:52:17,790
right,
right.

3324
02:52:17,850 --> 02:52:18,250
The,
the,

3325
02:52:18,310 --> 02:52:23,310
the perfect sphere that would have the 
same surface area and the same volume is

3326
02:52:23,471 --> 02:52:25,630
the earth is 7,920
miles.

3327
02:52:25,631 --> 02:52:28,060
That's and that's actually the the 
diameter of the earth.

3328
02:52:28,360 --> 02:52:31,120
If you took a line from the tropic of 
cancer,

3329
02:52:31,330 --> 02:52:35,260
23 and a half degrees north through the 
earth to the tropic of capricorn,

3330
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:39,070
you would discover that that diameter is
about 7,920

3331
02:52:39,071 --> 02:52:44,071
miles.
That's the number which I'm theorizing 

3332
02:52:44,071 --> 02:52:47,931
and,
and I'm thinking with a lot of evidence 

3333
02:52:47,931 --> 02:52:49,420
to back up that ancient peoples use to 
symbolize the earth.

3334
02:52:49,480 --> 02:52:54,480
Seven thousand 920.
But what you've just seen here is that 

3335
02:52:54,480 --> 02:52:55,420
this ancient unit of measurement called 
the furlong,

3336
02:52:55,570 --> 02:53:00,570
which is 660 feet is to the inch exactly
as the earth is to the mile.

3337
02:53:02,980 --> 02:53:04,660
Now,
what was the origin of the mile?

3338
02:53:05,190 --> 02:53:08,200
WHere did this myra,
we see we brought it up earlier,

3339
02:53:08,920 --> 02:53:11,740
length of the mile.
Five thousand 280 feet,

3340
02:53:12,050 --> 02:53:13,540
right?
What's the.

3341
02:53:13,541 --> 02:53:16,390
Or think about the latin word mill.
What does that mean?

3342
02:53:16,780 --> 02:53:17,980
A thousand,
right?

3343
02:53:18,570 --> 02:53:23,570
Like a million is a thousand.
Thousands of a millimeter is 1000th of a

3344
02:53:24,431 --> 02:53:25,330
meter,
right?

3345
02:53:25,750 --> 02:53:28,380
Because they're prefixing mil.
The middle,

3346
02:53:28,400 --> 02:53:31,090
the latin prefix,
that means a thousand,

3347
02:53:31,330 --> 02:53:36,330
right?
So that's where the actual word mild 

3348
02:53:36,330 --> 02:53:38,620
comes from.
So a mile is a thousand what?

3349
02:53:39,580 --> 02:53:41,890
So thousand paces.
Human paces.

3350
02:53:42,220 --> 02:53:46,210
So if you were to go out and walk off a 
thousand paces,

3351
02:53:47,050 --> 02:53:49,360
say counting every time your right foot 
hit the ground,

3352
02:53:50,660 --> 02:53:54,070
you did add a thousand times,
you're going to have a mile more or less

3353
02:53:54,071 --> 02:53:55,930
depending on your size.
You know,

3354
02:53:55,931 --> 02:54:00,931
I'm six foot one,
so I'm going to have a slightly longer 

3355
02:54:00,931 --> 02:54:00,931
pace than somebody who's five foot five.

3356
02:54:00,931 --> 02:54:05,580
Right?
But that's where the origin of the mild 

3357
02:54:05,580 --> 02:54:05,750
comes from,
from 5,000

3358
02:54:05,970 --> 02:54:08,790
from a thousand paces.
And given that the,

3359
02:54:08,920 --> 02:54:10,270
that,
that standardized,

3360
02:54:10,271 --> 02:54:11,530
but it's very ancient.
Safe.

3361
02:54:12,220 --> 02:54:15,610
Now,
the outer circle of stonehenge,

3362
02:54:15,670 --> 02:54:20,670
the sarsens stone circle,
if you were to encompass it in a circle 

3363
02:54:20,670 --> 02:54:22,960
that just tangent to the outer faces of 
the stone,

3364
02:54:23,590 --> 02:54:26,710
the radius of that circle is,
has been,

3365
02:54:26,890 --> 02:54:31,890
has been measured,
and it's almost exactly 52 point eight 

3366
02:54:31,890 --> 02:54:34,840
feet right,
or 100 of a mile.

3367
02:54:35,980 --> 02:54:38,500
Now,
if you take the diameter of stonehenge,

3368
02:54:38,501 --> 02:54:41,620
it's a double it,
which is 105 point six feet,

3369
02:54:42,640 --> 02:54:47,140
right?
50 times 100 point 105 point six.

3370
02:54:47,170 --> 02:54:51,310
There's your mile.
It suggests that the mile was being used

3371
02:54:51,340 --> 02:54:55,570
by those who built stonehenge 5,000
years ago,

3372
02:54:56,140 --> 02:55:01,140
but you see this number five,
point two eight is a universal 

3373
02:55:01,140 --> 02:55:02,500
relationship.
It it.

3374
02:55:02,680 --> 02:55:04,160
For one thing,
it says

3375
02:55:04,670 --> 02:55:08,090
the average human pace related to the 
foot,

3376
02:55:08,330 --> 02:55:13,330
which again,
remember protocols said man is the 

3377
02:55:13,330 --> 02:55:13,330
measure of all things,
right?

3378
02:55:13,760 --> 02:55:16,040
Where comes the inch?
It's this.

3379
02:55:16,100 --> 02:55:18,200
Here's the x right here.
The origin of the inch.

3380
02:55:18,230 --> 02:55:20,520
The distance between your thumb.
Yeah,

3381
02:55:20,660 --> 02:55:22,790
or it's already width of your thumb.
It's this.

3382
02:55:22,820 --> 02:55:23,240
Well,
yeah,

3383
02:55:23,260 --> 02:55:25,370
so you can.
You can measure here and that's going to

3384
02:55:25,371 --> 02:55:29,810
be an inch or you can take this and 
that's an inch as well.

3385
02:55:29,930 --> 02:55:30,980
So.
Okay,

3386
02:55:31,040 --> 02:55:34,040
so it's the tip of your thumb to the 
first joint.

3387
02:55:34,250 --> 02:55:35,860
Yes.
As essentially an.

3388
02:55:35,930 --> 02:55:38,690
And it depends because obviously you're 
trying to size,

3389
02:55:38,840 --> 02:55:39,650
right?
Right.

3390
02:55:40,010 --> 02:55:45,010
But the idea here is that the units of 
ancient measurement derive from one of 

3391
02:55:45,010 --> 02:55:49,721
two sources from the human yard stick or
the earth itself.

3392
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:55,000
Okay,
so now if you take the average human 

3393
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:58,160
pace divided by the average human foot,
it's five point two eight,

3394
02:55:58,700 --> 02:56:01,550
multiply that by a thousand and you have
the mile of 5,000,

3395
02:56:01,551 --> 02:56:02,660
280 feet.

3396
02:56:03,020 --> 02:56:08,020
Right?
I'm suggesting that that unit of 

3397
02:56:08,020 --> 02:56:11,060
measurement was actually incorporated 
into the design of stonehenge.

3398
02:56:11,390 --> 02:56:16,390
Right now,
what we have just seen is that the 

3399
02:56:16,390 --> 02:56:19,091
description of the new jerusalem in the 
book of revelations describes it as 

3400
02:56:19,091 --> 02:56:21,050
being 12,000
furlongs,

3401
02:56:21,500 --> 02:56:23,840
which again is an ancient british 
unitive measurement,

3402
02:56:24,320 --> 02:56:29,320
but probably used way beyond britain.
And when we look at the ratio of the 

3403
02:56:29,320 --> 02:56:34,241
furlong,
if we took out in the parking lot here 

3404
02:56:34,241 --> 02:56:37,430
and laid out a furlong 660 feet,
and then marked off one inch on it,

3405
02:56:37,970 --> 02:56:42,970
that furlong to that inch would be 
exactly the same as the diameter of the 

3406
02:56:42,970 --> 02:56:47,171
earth to the mile.
Now in in the book of revelations,

3407
02:56:47,600 --> 02:56:50,830
what it says is that the new jerusalem 
is 12,000

3408
02:56:50,930 --> 02:56:54,650
of these furlongs.
So if you take 660,

3409
02:56:55,490 --> 02:57:00,490
which I put in there times 12,000,
look at the number that comes up again,

3410
02:57:03,590 --> 02:57:04,760
there's a number again,
seven,

3411
02:57:04,761 --> 02:57:05,780
nine,
two zero,

3412
02:57:05,810 --> 02:57:06,720
zero,
zero.

3413
02:57:07,490 --> 02:57:09,270
But it's been raised by orders of 
magnitude.

3414
02:57:09,280 --> 02:57:13,100
Now divide that by the number of feet in
a mile.

3415
02:57:13,340 --> 02:57:17,930
Put the divide button here,
divide by 5,280

3416
02:57:18,650 --> 02:57:23,650
divided by 5,280.
And there is what they're describing a 

3417
02:57:24,921 --> 02:57:28,790
body that's 1500 miles in diameter,
right?

3418
02:57:29,570 --> 02:57:32,300
So what is that?
What is 1500 miles in diameter?

3419
02:57:32,390 --> 02:57:33,950
That's the mystery.
Now,

3420
02:57:34,250 --> 02:57:39,050
if you take that number,
and I'm going to go to the earth itself,

3421
02:57:39,051 --> 02:57:43,190
79 slash 20 and divided by the new 
jerusalem,

3422
02:57:43,430 --> 02:57:48,430
divide by 1500.
There's the ratio.

3423
02:57:48,831 --> 02:57:53,210
We get the human pace to the human foot.
Whoa.

3424
02:57:54,260 --> 02:57:59,260
Coincidence,
or are we beginning to see that there's 

3425
02:57:59,260 --> 02:58:00,530
an underlying pattern now?
Five to eight,

3426
02:58:00,890 --> 02:58:01,770
five to eight,
so

3427
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:03,840
the ratio is there,
right?

3428
02:58:03,930 --> 02:58:08,930
I'm not making any of this up,
so you either dismiss it as coincidence 

3429
02:58:08,930 --> 02:58:08,930
or you go,
okay,

3430
02:58:08,930 --> 02:58:12,600
there's an underlying pattern here and 
it's got some meaning to it.

3431
02:58:13,260 --> 02:58:18,260
Now I think it's going to be beyond our 
Ability today to really get into that,

3432
02:58:18,690 --> 02:58:21,690
but this is the kind of thing.
Would you be to peel back these layers?

3433
02:58:21,691 --> 02:58:24,570
You begin to discover that there are,
these ratio is built into this.

3434
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:26,550
So it's some in a sense

3435
02:58:27,460 --> 02:58:29,020
it's fractal,
yes.

3436
02:58:29,390 --> 02:58:30,270
Wow.
And,

3437
02:58:30,280 --> 02:58:33,230
and the idea here,
just like protocol has said that,

3438
02:58:33,960 --> 02:58:37,180
that we humans were the measure of,
of all things.

3439
02:58:37,250 --> 02:58:42,250
And in all of these cosmic dimensions 
are miniaturized and encoded in our very

3440
02:58:42,911 --> 02:58:43,480
anatomy,

3441
02:58:44,130 --> 02:58:46,590
randall carlson,
we have run out of time,

3442
02:58:46,591 --> 02:58:48,840
but you have blown minds on multiple 
front.

3443
02:58:49,020 --> 02:58:50,550
Once again,
man,

3444
02:58:50,880 --> 02:58:55,880
we gotta do another one.
When's the next time you tell me a good?

3445
02:58:57,110 --> 02:59:02,110
Well,
give me a few months to recover from 

3446
02:59:02,110 --> 02:59:02,110
this one.
Okay.

3447
02:59:02,110 --> 02:59:04,290
You tell me.
I'm going to bed for a week now.

3448
02:59:05,580 --> 02:59:10,580
Yeah,
I'm sure it was quite a burst of 

3449
02:59:10,580 --> 02:59:10,580
information,
but thank you sir.

3450
02:59:10,580 --> 02:59:10,580
I really,
really appreciate it.

3451
02:59:10,580 --> 02:59:12,090
It's always a pleasure having you here.
What?

3452
02:59:12,130 --> 02:59:13,590
You're one of my favorite podcast 
guests.

3453
02:59:13,591 --> 02:59:18,591
Without a doubt.
I enjoyed so much and I'm going to go 

3454
02:59:18,591 --> 02:59:19,230
over this podcast with a fine tooth comb
and try to figure it out.

3455
02:59:19,231 --> 02:59:22,500
I want to say one more quick thing.
A lot of this information that I've been

3456
02:59:22,501 --> 02:59:27,501
talking about here is on our dvd that 
you can get online,

3457
02:59:27,640 --> 02:59:30,780
a cosmic patterns and cycles of 
catastrophe.

3458
02:59:31,070 --> 02:59:36,070
Where are you getting all of the images 
and a lot of the background and the 

3459
02:59:36,070 --> 02:59:36,070
stuff that we went into.

3460
02:59:36,070 --> 02:59:37,530
So if you go to the sacred geometry 
international website,

3461
02:59:37,890 --> 02:59:40,190
you'll be able to find a link and find 
out all about it.

3462
02:59:40,240 --> 02:59:45,240
What is the exact website sacred 
geometry geometry international dotcom,

3463
02:59:45,270 --> 02:59:50,270
I guess.
So if you just put sacred geometry 

3464
02:59:50,270 --> 02:59:52,101
international into search engine,
it'll be the first thing that comes up 

3465
02:59:52,101 --> 02:59:54,860
in your google and your twitter handle 
is sacred geometry int correct,

3466
02:59:57,070 --> 02:59:57,680
right?
Yeah.

3467
02:59:57,690 --> 02:59:58,620
Is it right?
Hold on a second,

3468
02:59:58,621 --> 03:00:01,260
I'll check it out real quick.
Sacred?

3469
03:00:01,710 --> 03:00:04,530
Yeah.
Sacred geo int.

3470
03:00:04,620 --> 03:00:08,070
Okay.
So sacred geo at sacred g o I n t.

3471
03:00:08,730 --> 03:00:13,730
Thank you.
My friend is a massive honor and a 

3472
03:00:13,730 --> 03:00:15,180
privilege and a pleasure and I 
appreciate this so much.

3473
03:00:15,230 --> 03:00:16,740
Thank you.
I appreciate you having me.

3474
03:00:16,741 --> 03:00:17,690
Joe.
Listen man.

3475
03:00:17,760 --> 03:00:19,530
Changed the world.
You're the world.

3476
03:00:19,590 --> 03:00:24,590
Believe me.
Your freaking the fuck out while you're 

3477
03:00:24,590 --> 03:00:24,590
helping me.
Joe randall,

3478
03:00:24,720 --> 03:00:26,100
randall carlson,
lazy gentlemen.

3479
03:00:26,430 --> 03:00:28,530
He will be back in a few months.
We'll let him recover.

3480
03:00:28,531 --> 03:00:31,230
We'll send them some vitamin c,
send them some supplies.

3481
03:00:31,580 --> 03:00:33,260
We'll get them back out here.
Thank you brother.

3482
03:00:33,270 --> 03:00:36,890
I really appreciate it.
Wow.

3483
03:00:37,290 --> 03:00:38,280
Hmm.

3484
03:00:53,920 --> 03:00:55,690
Oh yeah.
Well if you don't drink much coffee,

3485
03:00:55,691 --> 03:00:56,550
that stuff will.
