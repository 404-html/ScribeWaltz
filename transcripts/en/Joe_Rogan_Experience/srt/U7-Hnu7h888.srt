1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,440
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,660
And I think a lot of it comes down to
that we shouldn't sort of protest what

3
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:11,080
we shouldn't agree with,
but we should build the things we should

4
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:13,480
build a future that we do agree with.
Um,

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,510
so when you look at the past few hundred
years of modernity and,

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,250
and our civilization,
what we see is dramatic positive trends

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,680
in terms of health,
wealth,

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,300
education,
violence,

9
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:29,980
and we had steven pinker on your show,
right?

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,993
Yeah.
Um,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,250
so I think that's really,
um,

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,890
yeah,
really positive trends and we've done a

13
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:39,250
good job in that and that all comes down
to,

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,240
uh,
our ability to sort of imagine things

15
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:47,140
that don't exist yet.
So sort of technology and innovation and

16
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:48,880
being able to work,
uh,

17
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:53,500
work together in an effective way,
which is think about the corporation.

18
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,590
Um,
so,

19
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,120
so I think those have been,
um,

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,260
yeah,
sort of very good trends.

21
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,400
And I think what we should do is we
should also think about how to apply

22
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:08,170
those to the area outside of our own
species and to the rest of the

23
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:10,060
environment.
Because when you look at all those

24
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:12,100
positive trends over the past few
hundred years,

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,140
um,
and then,

26
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,250
yeah,
that's all good,

27
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:19,120
but there's one very big exception,
which is the impact to the environment.

28
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:23,830
It's almost like we've had all the
success at the cost of the environment

29
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:26,860
and,
but I think that instead of it or some

30
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:30,750
people that have sort of a more
reactionary feel to this and they said,

31
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:32,100
well,
um,

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,330
look at,
uh,

33
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,670
all these problems,
it was created by businesses and by

34
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,550
technology.
So we should stay as far away from those

35
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:42,130
things as possible.
And I think that's sort of,

36
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,120
um,
you know,

37
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:45,730
that's sort of stupid.
I think that,

38
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,920
um,
it really just shows that these are

39
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:49,500
very,
um,

40
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,760
powerful ways of getting things done.

41
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,570
And I think a much more effective way
was to sort of apply that,

42
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:59,380
what has worked in other areas and then
also apply that to the area of the

43
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:00,240
environment.
So,

44
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,760
so I don't think,
you know,

45
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,860
I,
for example,

46
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:06,160
think that the car problem is not going
to be solved by banning cars,

47
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:07,900
I think is going to be sold by electric
cars.

48
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:12,400
And I don't think the meat pollution
problem is going to be solved by

49
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:15,520
everyone becoming Vegan.
I think it's going to be solved by

50
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,360
things like lab grown meat and other
kinds of alternatives.

51
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,470
Um,
so,

52
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:22,550
and that's why I also think that,
um,

53
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,880
yeah,
the ocean cleanup or the plastic

54
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:29,470
pollution problem is not going to be
solved by sort of people trying to do

55
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:31,790
their own little bits and um,
you know,

56
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,340
trying to live without plastic or things
like that I think is going to be solved

57
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,760
by,
um,

58
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,720
you know,
things like,

59
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,540
uh,
plastics that do not harm to the

60
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:44,770
environment as well as technologies like
the ocean cleanup to sort of clean up

61
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,970
after herself.
So,

62
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,260
um,
yeah.

63
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:49,280
And I hope that the education can be a
sort of a,

64
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:51,130
as a symbol of that approach.

65
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,000
You had like one of the most spectacular
fights with Jon Jones.

66
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:56,820
I mean,
down to the wire is as close as it gets.

67
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,710
And when you get out of a fight like
that,

68
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:02,110
will,
you almost won the title against the

69
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:03,760
greatest of all time.
Like,

70
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:06,010
what is,
what is that feeling like and where do

71
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:09,590
you go from there?
Uh,

72
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,490
you know,
it was tough.

73
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,490
It was really tough because I know
everybody was saying,

74
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,220
are you winning this fight?
Winning this fight?

75
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,070
You have to be run this against him.
Are you winning this fight?

76
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,750
I,
if it felt like,

77
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,860
and like you said,
it was something,

78
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,030
it was just,
it was just right there at the goal

79
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:28,970
line.
You know,

80
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,360
I didn't really pass that goal nine at
all.

81
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,920
Um,
I just felt like that it was tough.

82
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:37,120
It was tough,
but by,

83
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,120
but like now I'm sitting here now
talking to you.

84
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,640
It's a big,
it's a really good experience for me.

85
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,780
And,
and in,

86
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,510
I really,
it's a good time for me.

87
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,910
If I was,
w is a highlight in my career for sure

88
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:49,990
in my life,
for sure.

89
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,610
It was such a close fight when the,
when the scorecards are being tagged and

90
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:55,450
you,
uh,

91
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,430
you know,
you're just sitting there waiting for

92
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:58,840
the decision.
Did you think you hadn't,

93
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,150
you know,
I didn't know.

94
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,200
Right?
I didn't know.

95
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,570
I didn't know much chaos.
Could you even remember what had

96
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:07,390
happened over the last five rounds?
I remember,

97
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:08,710
I remember,
I remember the,

98
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,230
I remember the fight,
uh,

99
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,600
and I got,
uh,

100
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,950
I remember almost the whole fight,
but it was just John.

101
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,900
John's just such a basis.
He,

102
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,240
I'm telling you,
just for me,

103
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:25,840
John Jealous winning over John Jones is
bigger than taking the belt.

104
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,680
I'm telling him,
that guy's the guy is such a beast and,

105
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:32,710
and uh,
yeah.

106
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,573
What was the question?

107
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,440
No,
it's okay to express yourself.

108
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:37,580
That's fine.
I mean,

109
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:39,140
I agree with you.
He is a beast.

110
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,410
We had a little chalkboard sign out
front that said Venison is the new Kale

111
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,360
and you know,
we get cute with our sign.

112
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:47,750
We tease other restaurants around us
like we have fun with the sign and it's

113
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:49,750
fun.
And uh,

114
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,910
the cyclist Vegan rode by and took huge
offense to our sign and all of a sudden

115
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,640
one day these protesters just showed up.
So,

116
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,060
um,
originally I was just kind of frustrated

117
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:04,700
because they're totally misguided
because,

118
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,610
um,
we take a lot of pride in where our food

119
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:10,850
comes from.
We have Vegan and vegetarian dishes on

120
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:11,641
the menu.
Uh,

121
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:16,641
and I really respect that type of diet.
So we were just totally floored with why

122
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:19,040
this was happening.
And,

123
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,110
um,
so this started to go on.

124
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:26,060
They'd started come every week and they
went from like two or three people being

125
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,210
kind of peaceful to being like 10,
15 people,

126
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:30,680
not so peaceful.
So,

127
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,750
uh,
it's when it turned not so peaceful.

128
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:36,680
They were shouting at our,
at our guests and shouting in our door

129
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:38,620
and really trying to harm our business.
That,

130
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:40,340
uh,
I just kind of got fed up.

131
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:44,240
Last resort went down,
we get a hold dear a couple times a

132
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:46,100
month and we,
we butchered ourselves.

133
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,963
And,
uh,

134
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,751
I just said,
screw it.

135
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:48,800
Screw it.
I'm like,

136
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,660
I'm going to get these people to get out
of here.

137
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,940
So I thought that that would make them
go away.

138
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,540
How did you think that was gonna make
it,

139
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:55,560
make

140
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,980
them go away and not escalate it?
Uh,

141
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:58,761
I don't know.
I was,

142
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:02,210
it was just totally like last resort,
a totally fed up.

143
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,220
Um,
I wanted to defend myself,

144
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,240
defend our customers.
You know,

145
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,000
you could see people walking in visibly
upset,

146
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,470
um,
you know,

147
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:11,180
they're being shouted at being screamed
at,

148
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:13,670
called a murderer as they're walking in
for dinner and like,

149
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:15,590
you're going on a date,
you want to hear this time and then

150
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:18,020
people are screaming at you,
uh,

151
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,280
you know,
just for eating.

152
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,400
So,
uh,

153
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,250
I was just fed up and I just kinda
thought like,

154
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,130
you know,
buzz off and why?

155
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,660
So just one sign once I seen is the new
Kale one sign set this whole thing off.

156
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,013
Yeah.

157
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,770
I had those abilities.
If I'm a kid growing up in this

158
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:40,300
environment and I can't find refuge in
my school,

159
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,510
I can't find refuge at home because my
mom's working three or four or five

160
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:45,940
jobs.
So she's never there.

161
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,810
Where am I going to go find parents?
I'm go,

162
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:49,600
where am I going to find that pyramid to
influence?

163
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,930
I'm gonna find on the streets.
So now I'm on the streets being led by

164
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,480
people who grew up in exam tech
conditions that I grew up in.

165
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,040
And so now I'm like,
okay,

166
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,380
well I have to make money.
What am I going to do for money?

167
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,900
While then there's their knock old
economy very conveniently,

168
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,793
right?
Therefore me,

169
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,880
right?
Sell drugs.

170
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,190
So now I'm selling,
now I'm standing on the corner selling

171
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:07,960
drugs.
I got to protect my product,

172
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,450
right?
If I don't,

173
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:11,380
someone's gonna take it from me.

174
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,760
So what do I do?
I get a gun,

175
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,840
I carry a gun.
Now I'm stuck in this situation.

176
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:19,420
Now I'm just stuck in this violent loop,
right?

177
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,200
If that feeds on itself.
And so now I'm stuck defending myself

178
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:25,660
against the guy who's shooting at me,
trying to take my stuff and I'm shooting

179
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:27,130
back in him.
Maybe not because I'm trying to take

180
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:28,750
care of stuff,
but because he's trying to take them on,

181
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,330
right?
So that's where you get that violence

182
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:33,820
that comes from that,
from those particular areas.

183
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,290
Now,
if we would've sat back and said,

184
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:40,291
okay,
we have hyper concentrated areas in this

185
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:42,370
country.
This is a widespread,

186
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,910
it's hyper concentrated communities in
this country that are dealing with this,

187
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,480
that are also the result of the vast
majority of our gun violence.

188
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,600
And we sat back and thought about it
from a socioeconomic standpoint.

189
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,880
How do we fix this?
What do we do?

190
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:57,960
How do we present opportunity?
I'm not saying going in and just hand

191
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:59,950
out stuff,
but how do we fix this from the

192
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:03,160
standpoint of improving our schools?
How was I can drive five minutes,

193
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,680
one direction and have a school that has
everything you can name and then driving

194
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,660
and the driving the opposite direction
the school has can barely have textbooks

195
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,270
to give to their kids.
Think about that.

196
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,690
So why,
why aren't we focusing our energy on

197
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:20,410
building that up versus talking about,
oh we need to get the guns off the

198
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:21,640
streets.
You did that.

199
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:24,790
You have that in Chicago.
You have every gun law imaginable in

200
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,100
Chicago,
but yet southside Chicago still looks

201
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:29,530
the way that it does still has a
violence that it does,

202
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,970
right?
So if we would,

203
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,930
if we provide,
when you give people something lose or

204
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,930
the lift for,
they don't throw away life so easily.

205
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,610
Plain and simple.
So if my social economic status is in

206
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:45,610
the dirt,
I don't have a problem looking at

207
00:08:45,611 --> 00:08:48,130
another kid down the street and shooting
at him and taking his life.

208
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,390
I don't have anything.
I don't have anything to lose,

209
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,090
but if we would focus our attention in
fixing,

210
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,980
same way we talk about the mental health
issue with respective mass shootings and

211
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:02,010
school shootings,
we wouldn't have to worry about the guns

212
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:05,160
because we won't have people wanting to
do those things or have the capability

213
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,110
to do those things.
Right.

214
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,730
So then that deals with that vast
majority of the violence that we had.

215
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:14,670
They're focusing that energy in fixing
those communities.

216
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,910
The point of the story was this,
Isis came around and people were

217
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:18,840
suddenly like,
oh my God,

218
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,670
where did this come from?
Of course,

219
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:23,820
those of us who had been monitoring the
situation knew this was going to come

220
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:25,620
back around very,
very heavy.

221
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,370
Now that isis has been pushed back.
And this is where this story is sort of

222
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:33,150
the point of the story is we've got to
resist the temptation to believe the

223
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:37,080
problem has been solved because the,
the organization known as Isis,

224
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:40,200
which isn't a bureaucracy has been
fought back,

225
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,860
but the ideology upon which that
organization was built,

226
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,740
um,
is still very much alive and it's still

227
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,620
strong.
Um,

228
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,950
what al Qaeda did while the whole world
was focused on Isis was exploit that

229
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:57,690
opportunity to rebuild and regroup and
they'd been rebuilding in Syria.

230
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,790
Now they are stronger than they have
ever been even under binladin because

231
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,280
for the first time in the history of
that organization,

232
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,260
they are firmly embedded within the
Syrian population as a genuinely kind of

233
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,300
viewed by the people that they were
fighting on behalf of as a grassroots

234
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,290
resistance organization.
Where's it before that,

235
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,480
they were seen as a terrorist group that
was like a,

236
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,620
you know,
just like a vanguard.

237
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,020
They've embedded themselves in the
Syrian population,

238
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,410
in the Yemeni,
uh,

239
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,770
civil war.
They've embedded themselves in north

240
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:26,940
Africa,
east Africa,

241
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,940
and in Pakistan.
And they are resurgent and they are

242
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:33,120
grooming a Hamza bin Laden who was been
not in Sun.

243
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,310
Um,
and the grooming him for leadership and,

244
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,530
and as an a time will come maybe in a
couple of months,

245
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:40,530
maybe in a couple of years where they
announced Hamza bin Laden as a new

246
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:43,240
leader of al Qaeda currently at Saint
Monzo.

247
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:44,940
Ari,
when they do that,

248
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,480
once they grooming has been complete and
assuming Hamza isn't killed,

249
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,040
uh,
up until then,

250
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,260
all of the fragments of what remains of
Isis will probably rejoin al Qaeda under

251
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:57,840
Hamza bin Laden.
And you'll have a stronger than ever

252
00:10:57,841 --> 00:11:00,540
before Al Queida Organization.
And we've got to,

253
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,850
we've got to remember that we never
expected isis to emerge.

254
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,520
Hokkaido.
We'll come back with a vengeance.

255
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:15,520
Okay.
