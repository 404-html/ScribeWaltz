1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,720
Shit out of me,
dude.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,250
Did you change the right now?
Yeah.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,390
Yes,
I did.

4
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,040
Beautiful.
Fly Me to the moon.

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,130
Don't.
Don't show me.

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,260
That's all I can say this without much.
Probably they'll probably get you just 

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,060
for the tone just to you.
I bet you go,

8
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,490
Duh,
Duh,

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,330
Duh,
Duh.

10
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,800
They own that docs,
those fucks.

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,190
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is 
brought to you by the fleshlight.

12
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,390
Someday.
We're going to have Sam Harris on the 

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:31,390
podcast.
I had lunch with him today.

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,450
Famous neurosurgeon,
prominent atheist,

15
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,890
author,
genius.

16
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:37,530
Extraordinary.
And on that day the fleshlight.

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,320
I'm going to tell you what we won't be 
talking about Ya.

18
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,430
He's responsible,
he's sensitive and rightly so.

19
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:47,760
You know,
if people found his shit online and they

20
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:52,761
went and researched that and we talked 
for the first 20 minutes about the 

21
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,030
fleshlight is credit him somewhere not 
sex.

22
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:54,900
Sex Talk.
No,

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,980
but sex toy.

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,720
Maybe.
What if we disguise it?

25
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,370
Like we just talked about what we are 
dealing with.

26
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:06,300
The flashlight was back when we only had
one podcast a week and you know,

27
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:11,020
now we do often three podcasts a week 
and we still talk about the flashlight.

28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,250
You know,
we'd never tried to charge them more 

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:16,250
money ever.
I think if they skip a podcast,

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,000
they're just going to have to deal with 
that shit sometimes you have to.

31
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:21,030
If it were,
what were huge.

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,740
I'm a huge supporter of the freshlime.
I,

33
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,750
I really wish Sam could just sit here 
and we could talk about it like two 

34
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,650
intelligent people,
you know.

35
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,350
Is it fucking up?
These things suck,

36
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:34,070
man.
We've got to get limp Dick.

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,520
Look at it.
It's all floppy,

38
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:37,380
floppy.
I got it.

39
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,310
Got It.
Yeah.

40
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,800
Talk right into that bitch.
Anyway.

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,180
Flashlights have solid products.
Oh yeah.

42
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,810
Everybody knows what it is that,
you know the commercial.

43
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,530
You know the deal.
I kind of am.

44
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,620
Brian pointed this out to me yesterday.
It's kind of freaking me out the other 

45
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:52,620
day.
I really.

46
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,070
It is the same thing.
I am saying the same thing.

47
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,050
So even though I'm trying not to say the
same thing,

48
00:01:55,051 --> 00:02:00,051
I'm still saying the same thing because 
ultimately I have to say that to get 

49
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:03,930
discount you'd go to Joe Rogan.net
and you click on the link and you enter 

50
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:03,930
in the code name.
Rogan.

51
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,610
Yeah.
All the other things I can just record.

52
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:09,720
It will not be a bad idea.
But people like this,

53
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:14,721
for whatever reason,
they like the fact that we would like 

54
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:14,721
this better.
It's better I think really talking.

55
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:15,810
I think it's just the certain parts 
where you know,

56
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:20,811
like when you,
especially when you're talking about on 

57
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:20,811
it and you're like,
you know,

58
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:20,811
steal the own products.

59
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:20,811
I really,
really.

60
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:25,190
I know they know that,
but just people that are listening to 

61
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,190
this for the first time,
I know it sounds crazy to everybody else

62
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,430
has been on board from the beginning.
We love you.

63
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:29,190
We appreciate you very much.
But we can't do a show just for you.

64
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,920
We have to do a show.
Recognizing the fact that somebody might

65
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:33,540
be tuning into this.
You know what I mean?

66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,880
It's like following you.
I don't like following shows.

67
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,780
Like I could never watch dexter mid 
season.

68
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,950
I'm not going to do it.
You lost me because it's all it all 

69
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,531
done.
It falls into each other and I don't 

70
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:45,531
know who the fuck that guy is.
This girl.

71
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:46,290
Why is she calling him?
Well,

72
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,550
why?
Why am I supposed to care?

73
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,800
I liked the whole years.
Hold apart,

74
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,160
hold together.
You're already your a.

75
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,880
But you got to watch them in order and 
you know,

76
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,980
someone could be tuning into this 
fucking show for the first time.

77
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:58,530
I don't want them to have to know a 
bunch of insights.

78
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:00,160
Shit.
You know what my favorite

79
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,160
thing is as people are sitting on 
twitter lately is fleshlight stuffed 

80
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,580
into their mattresses in their beds and 
printouts of my face like above it,

81
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:13,951
like on the mattress.
So it looks like they're fucking it 

82
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:13,951
while looking at my face.
That's Kinda hot.

83
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:17,910
Yeah Bro.
As long as they're not mean moms when 

84
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,391
they're done,
they don't stab your picture and go 

85
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:21,391
fucking crazy.
Yeah.

86
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:22,880
I wish it wasn't guys.
Maybe they shouldn't.

87
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,340
Girls.
So their finger and themselves to you.

88
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,060
I bet there are just rubbing their to 
figure demons.

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,710
Vaginosis and this podcast reaches a lot
of human beings.

90
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:33,190
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands.
This got to be one girl out there as.

91
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,900
Oh,
Brian's on.

92
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,520
She just fucking get crazy.
She's probably one of those girls that 

93
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,500
clause that or pussy you ever wants to 
like a porno where a girl,

94
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:42,760
she's clawing at it.
You're like,

95
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,590
hey,
hey,

96
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:44,000
hey.

97
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,580
Are you sure your phone?
Brody,

98
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,360
brody Stevens.
Yeah.

99
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,740
I don't like when they clawed at Man,
that makes me uncomfortable.

100
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,800
You know,
like if I was doing that I would feel 

101
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,170
like I was being way too rough.
Roughly screaming you like,

102
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,040
Hey,
what the fuck,

103
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,610
you know?
And this girl just took it in her own 

104
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:05,610
pussy.
I'm like,

105
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:05,610
oh,
what's going on there?

106
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,720
Is that thing just numb,
you know,

107
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,630
that's what they say.
Um,

108
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,990
it is actually some sort of a scientific
or nothing?

109
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,390
No,
no,

110
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:11,050
no.
People that,

111
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,590
it's like genital piercings and like,
especially when they have a lot of them,

112
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,370
many of them,
they believe it's connected to a disease

113
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:20,710
where they don't feel,
uh,

114
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,630
feel things the same way.
We do,

115
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,050
they don't have the same amount of 
sensory input from pain,

116
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,380
so they have to really hurt themselves.
Then there's certain people that,

117
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,660
you know,
there's a broad spectrum of how the 

118
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,851
human body works and operates and 
sometimes the wonky thing is that their 

119
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:40,330
pain is,
it doesn't work.

120
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,410
It doesn't work.
Right.

121
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,560
And they,
they want to experience pain so they,

122
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:49,561
they'll pierce themselves,
especially if their genitals beside 

123
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:50,320
sexual abuse.
That's another thing with,

124
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,180
with uh,
with genital piercing.

125
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,700
But it's also because I thought it felt 
better for them.

126
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,700
Did you ever hear that nursing?
I've heard it with like girls clips and 

127
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,451
stuff like that,
but I always thought they were just 

128
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:03,451
crazy,
you know,

129
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:05,020
but there was the video of the guy 
getting fucked to death by the horse.

130
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,200
Mr Hans,
that guy has balls are all peer stop.

131
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,010
Oh really?
Yeah,

132
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:09,610
like,
like,

133
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,070
like a,
like a three ring binder.

134
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,140
You watch that video.
I've watched some man times.

135
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,050
That's to me as you've studied that,
the cinematography.

136
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,580
Yeah.
I could tell if you fucked with it.

137
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,670
If it was a brutal felony trying to cut 
out scenes,

138
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,430
I'd be like,
no,

139
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:22,700
no,
no,

140
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:23,010
no,
no.

141
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,280
That's not what didn't come yet.
Some shit out.

142
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,150
You cut some shit out the most.
Came too quick,

143
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,320
but ball is bulging there.
You can tell it's still full assessment 

144
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,750
on it.
Dot Com is our other sponsor and I do 

145
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,240
have to say I'm a.
people are getting annoyed with these 

146
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,641
ads as well,
but some people haven't heard of before 

147
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,890
so I have to say it in a certain amount 
of order and they want to take a break 

148
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:43,890
in the middle.
Yeah,

149
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,740
yeah.
What do you want folks?

150
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,600
The fuck you want me to list?
You're talking about Dr.

151
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,510
remember a radio host?
Just go into their spiel.

152
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,600
The middle of the grossest pbs.
I was assigned to this Terence Mckenna 

153
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,070
interview and he was on pbs and every 
fucking five minutes.

154
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:00,350
No bullshit.
Every five minutes.

155
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,590
This is our fun drive.
Our Big Fund drives here if you want to 

156
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,590
keep conversations going,
guilt kids,

157
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,760
great conversation we're having right 
now with Terence Mckenna.

158
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,700
Please donate.
You can donate by baby blue.

159
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,990
We can offer this and you get a cup,
you get your fresh air with the in front

160
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:18,130
of tasks,
but kind of saying he kept doing it.

161
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,850
It was like,
I will pay you anything to not have you 

162
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,590
do that.
You're torturing people.

163
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:27,230
Nobody wants to hear that.
That's a ridiculous thing.

164
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,080
You're making people who are listening 
to an hour interview,

165
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,970
listen to six fucking commercials.
You stop it six times.

166
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,190
Fuck you.
You know I heard it already.

167
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,020
What are you doing?
You pestering me?

168
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,260
You.
Who the fuck do you think you're 

169
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,731
reaching?
Are they're the same people to random 

170
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:48,551
people.
Just start tuning in halfway through 

171
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:48,551
this fucking thing.
The shaking you down.

172
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:49,610
You asshole with boredom.
Cut it out.

173
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,670
Go makes you want to kill him.
Give me your money.

174
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,260
You more delusional content and the only
reason why they think they can get away 

175
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,481
with this because we rely on public 
funding because they didn't rely on 

176
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:01,481
public funding and be like,
fuck you man.

177
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:06,040
I'm not buying your shit.
You're asking me to buy your shit every 

178
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,530
six minutes.
So yeah.

179
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,550
Well,
I have these commercials probably after 

180
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,550
a few times out.
You'd probably think the same.

181
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,000
What happened here,
what happened from the 15 minutes or 15 

182
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,700
second spots in 30 seconds to like the 
10 minute spots.

183
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,410
It seems like a jump.
One day.

184
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,400
Products you don't get ever get to the 
product.

185
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,150
And we have to deal with controversy.
Controversy,

186
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:25,810
yeah.
This,

187
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,790
there's always a,
it's not just new products,

188
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,840
new products dealing with controversy.
Oh,

189
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:31,670
one thing I can tell because of your 
voices,

190
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,830
the discount code,
Rogan,

191
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,310
there's only good the first time you use
it now it's good anytime you use it.

192
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:40,370
So anytime you use a code name,
Rogan you get 10 percent off every time.

193
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:41,810
Now that's good.
That's better.

194
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,140
And um,
we have a new whole new product line 

195
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,390
we're coming out with like hemp protein 
and shit like that.

196
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,070
And we're going to start selling 
kettlebells.

197
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,460
Kettlebells are expensive.
They're expensive as fuck for no reason 

198
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,331
why you can get like high quality ones 
made as long as you're selling them 

199
00:07:58,331 --> 00:07:58,331
online.
Like we would do it.

200
00:07:58,331 --> 00:07:58,850
Not trying to bring them to stores and 
shit like that.

201
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,110
So we could sell them like same quality,
way cheaper than everybody else calls 

202
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,691
them.
You find out a lot of things and you 

203
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:07,691
start selling things like how much money
people make for shit.

204
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:09,160
One of the things about,
about,

205
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,150
um,
on it and Alpha brand people were like,

206
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:11,780
well,
why is it so,

207
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:13,100
you know,
why is it so expensive?

208
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Do our profit margin compared to most 
supplements is way lower than the 

209
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,550
ingredients are very fucking expensive.
All the shit that we have in is the best

210
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:25,100
quality available.
We're really doing it like the worst way

211
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:28,610
ever to make money because we're saying 
you get 100 percent money back guarantee

212
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:33,611
if you don't like if you use it,
it used to be you could buy up fucking 

213
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:33,890
100 bottles and you wouldn't even have 
to send them back.

214
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,950
We would just give you your money.
But too many people were ripping us off.

215
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,470
They were selling them on Ebay and shit.
So we had to stop doing that.

216
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,970
But.
But if you order it,

217
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,410
you don't like it,
you don't have to send it back.

218
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:43,670
Just tell us.
I didn't like it.

219
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:47,660
Didn't do anything for me.
Even something is strange as a vitamin,

220
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:52,661
you know what I mean?
How do you know of a vitamin is doing 

221
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:52,661
something for you?
Do you really fucking know?

222
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:53,360
I mean,
how much time does it take before you're

223
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:56,040
so in tune with your body that you can 
tell when you have and have not

224
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,220
a multivitamin sign?
If it's a radioactive vitamins,

225
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,310
you can tell Dan,
you can tell,

226
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,040
but that said,
if you take vitamins on a regular basis,

227
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,560
you will notice a difference in your 
overall health.

228
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:09,561
I'm absolutely convinced of that.
That is my experience in my life and 

229
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:13,341
I've read studies that say otherwise,
but I've also seen studies that I know 

230
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:17,351
are influenced by bullshit by 
pharmaceutical companies and they've 

231
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:20,181
been trying to license nutraceuticals.
They were trying to make it so that 

232
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:22,590
vitamins are prescription only for a 
long time.

233
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,740
That's something pharmaceuticals 
pharmaceutical companies have lobby to 

234
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,320
try to do.
A couple of times we shot down.

235
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,500
The pharmaceutical companies would.
They would have the rights to sell 

236
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:33,500
vitamin C.
If you wanted vitamin C,

237
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:33,870
you would have to go get a prescription 
for it.

238
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,910
We're going to have a terrific.
You would have to go to doctors to get 

239
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:38,910
vitamins,
you know,

240
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,011
a fucking terrible that would be,
and you would have to give you a 

241
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:43,011
prescription for all of them.

242
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:43,011
He wouldn't,
you know,

243
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,320
I guess unless we had some open,
you know,

244
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,910
you would have to have things that are 
approved and then those things that were

245
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:52,911
approved,
you would have an open prescription for 

246
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:53,820
any extra dietary nutrients.
I mean that's.

247
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,180
Unless you would have it every time you 
wanted to get some vitamin D because 

248
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,260
they can make money off of it and they 
could keep supplement companies.

249
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,000
You know,
the I the word right now,

250
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:04,860
who,
who gives it just regulating anybody.

251
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,490
That's the problem is that they feel 
like it's,

252
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,840
it's not regulated enough.
You know,

253
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,560
and there's a good point too that there 
is,

254
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:15,561
there's a very good point to that,
but it's way worse than way better 

255
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:18,771
rather than overregulation,
which is what it would be if you had a 

256
00:10:18,771 --> 00:10:18,960
prescribed vitamins.
Yeah,

257
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,800
no,
get it.

258
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,130
People have figured out what works and 
what doesn't work.

259
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:28,130
There's a lot of,
there's a lot of scientific studies 

260
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,130
about the efficacy of all sorts of 
different multivitamins,

261
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,650
you know,
there's,

262
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,160
there's things that point to the fact 
that they can,

263
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,320
you know,
certain ones can help you in stress.

264
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:35,990
Be Twelve gives you energy.
There's,

265
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:37,770
it's not nonsense.
You know,

266
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,870
there's,
there's a lot of reality and vitamins.

267
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,280
These are,
you know,

268
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:46,310
what you're doing is you're 
supplementing the essential parts of 

269
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,070
food that are healthy for you.
It's really that simple.

270
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,400
You know,
and I have always been a person that as 

271
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,111
try to,
as much as I can eat healthy and when I 

272
00:10:57,111 --> 00:10:58,230
can't eat healthy,
I make sure I'm always taking vitamins.

273
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,280
You got to give you.
Yeah,

274
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,950
I noticed a difference.
You got to give your body a chance.

275
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,040
You know,
when he was doing Jujitsu,

276
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,140
he was eating fucking hot dogs and shit.

277
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,910
No vitamins,
no nothing.

278
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,410
All Day.
Yeah.

279
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:12,150
And he was getting injured all the time.
I was like,

280
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:13,890
what are you eating?
What are you throwing in your body?

281
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,000
So it was like,
Yup,

282
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,230
Nachos,
whatever.

283
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,170
See what's around.
So for now,

284
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,850
uh,
if you're interested in nootropics,

285
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,410
here's the Spiel,
disassociated every week.

286
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,780
Google that shit.
Don't just buy her stuff.

287
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,810
Google it.
There's a bunch of different companies 

288
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:29,810
out there.
I'm sure they're all,

289
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:29,970
there's a bunch of good ones.
So you don't need to buy our stuff.

290
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,430
If you think our stuff too expensive,
there's all you have to do.

291
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,460
Buy everything in bulk.
The ingredient list is all online and 

292
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,110
it's,
it's listed exactly how much is in each,

293
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,250
each different supplements.
So take,

294
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,100
take the ingredients list,
make your own seriously.

295
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,490
I'm 100 percent happy if people do that.
I don't care if you buy it,

296
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:52,491
you don't like it.
You get 100 percent of your money back 

297
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:52,491
for the first order.
If you keep buying it.

298
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:52,610
And then you say,
I didn't look,

299
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,030
there's one didn't

300
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,400
look this one that I have a feeling that
you just fucking crazy.

301
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,960
That's it.
Don't forget about higher primate.

302
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,960
You never talked about that.
That's awesome.

303
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:04,120
You,
you ever going to have a sale?

304
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,850
I feel bad because it's like I'm 
sponsoring myself.

305
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,580
Yeah.
But that's,

306
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,510
that's actually,
you know,

307
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,020
a lot of people I think would love so 
much.

308
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,140
Some core t shirts.
Well,

309
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:14,200
if you're ancho monkeys and weed and you
probably are right,

310
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,000
who isn't good to hire-primate.com.
That's my tee shirt company.

311
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,240
And I've actually been meaning to talk 
to about this because we've got a whole 

312
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,700
new um,
new supply in A.

313
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:29,701
Yeah.
So it's just a weird cartoon monkeys 

314
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:30,310
that are getting high monkeys.
It's cool.

315
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:35,311
I always,
when I got monkeys playing chess with 

316
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:35,890
aliens,
monkeys doing mushrooms,

317
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,020
it's,
we got new ones coming out too.

318
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,130
I'm gonna have to sign new.

319
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,070
Yeah.
I'm going to have some new designs about

320
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:46,410
monkeys and mushrooms because I want to 
get some,

321
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:51,411
a stoned ape theory type illustration or
the monkeys were all gathered around a 

322
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:56,071
glowing mushroom.
I just got to get another guy to draw 

323
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:56,410
one up.
But how about this?

324
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,830
How about a bunch of those monkeys 
passing liquor?

325
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,750
Join around at one good.
It has a thought bubble and he's like,

326
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,030
Oh,
this one monkey dude.

327
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,160
He gets a thought of whatever.
I don't know.

328
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,470
The stoned ape theory was.
It's like operator though,

329
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,050
like it starts off with like a scribble 
and then it turns into a banana.

330
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,150
It's a good idea though,
Jude,

331
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:16,570
a monkey with a balloon in a in a joint 
line and he's like,

332
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,010
Oh shit.
I got an idea.

333
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,820
Ideas the third,
they came up with powerful Ari Shaffir 

334
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,260
or it could be a crazy idea,
so crazy at work.

335
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,170
So crazy that started sending up the 
gun,

336
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,110
the fleshlight link and entering the 
code name.

337
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Rogan you get 10 percent off from now 
and for every order in the flashlight 

338
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,970
for fleshlight proper eternity.
What the times a million hits it.

339
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,840
Hit that shit,
bitch.

340
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,670
Let's start this fucking disaster off 
the Joe Rogan experience.

341
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,770
Hey,
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

342
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,320
Yeah.
He said that he beat Bj Penn.

343
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,480
Oh my god.
Isn't that the cOolest thing ever?

344
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:14,750
Yeah.
You said that after he beat bj penn or 

345
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:14,750
like,
oh shit,

346
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,470
we got to get a recording of that coming
fighters.

347
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:20,410
If you want to have your own joe roGan 
experience opening,

348
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,360
just say it after you win and we'll put 
you on this ticket.

349
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,800
They're goIng to give you some.
Give you some propers,

350
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,640
so silver.
Oh,

351
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,580
she had water pipes.com.
Santa.

352
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,430
The coolest boss ever.
It's bad.

353
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,000
tied tack one.
Yeah,

354
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,250
that's pretty cool.
Yeah,

355
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,210
you know what it is?
It's exactly like dyson for bongs,

356
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,190
like even their website,
like if you go to their website,

357
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:46,060
it's just like a dyson website.
It's so nicely crafted in India.

358
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,280
You don't have to like pull up the card 
for it to,

359
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:49,300
you know,
take a hit.

360
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:52,310
You just push down this little thing and
it opens up the carb for you.

361
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,210
So it's,
it's just,

362
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,120
it's an awesome bong I've used many,
many times before,

363
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,760
but that one is just tight.
I want to get rid of really bad.

364
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,770
They took it to the next level.
They did.

365
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:02,510
They had to clear out that bowl.
You just,

366
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,620
you pull down a little,
a little stem has like a little lever on

367
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:09,280
it and then you can pop it out of the 
bowl.

368
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:15,200
The bowl just wash it out and it won't 
break either.

369
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:17,660
It's super delicate.
Shit.

370
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,100
Broke the bond in this.
Of the ice house.

371
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,970
Oh no.
Really knocked it over to my core.

372
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:24,140
Like a retard.
Yeah,

373
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,300
and bong.
Water smells wrong.

374
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:31,330
Water had peed on it.
There's no way you're cleaning that out 

375
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,681
every day.
You got to get some of that stuff that 

376
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:35,681
you can get at petco for when your cat 
piss.

377
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:36,530
That's so funny.
You said that you used that.

378
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,210
You have ever kept the pictures in your 
house?

379
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,500
Yeah,
we talked about a couple of weeks ago.

380
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,530
Piss all over mY fucking bed couch.
I just found out.

381
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:43,580
What's that?
What's that about?

382
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:45,290
Like he's trying to tell you something 
like you're a punk.

383
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,450
You know?
I saw it.

384
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,620
Had a urinary infection of some kind and
that's what it was from because now 

385
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,930
she's not doing it,
but use that as an excuse.

386
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:55,930
I think they just like pissing on you.
Yeah,

387
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:57,080
I think so.
Mad.

388
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:02,081
Yeah.
Urinary tract infection doesn't make 

389
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:02,470
them pee in one specific spot.
They just bothers them.

390
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,110
They blame the eu when they put like a 
Bird on your pillow.

391
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,060
That's them trying to give you a gift 
card.

392
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,040
Your front doorstep.
They're presenting that to,

393
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,130
you know,
they like you.

394
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,930
My other theory is that my dog has been 
at my house for the last couple of weeks

395
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,150
and so the dog,
when it's usually in town,

396
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:25,151
just like,
starts like chasing the cat and like 

397
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:25,151
it's so I think because now the dog's 
gone.

398
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:25,250
The cats like,
oh yeah,

399
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,200
I'm a P on.
Were you always liked to sit?

400
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,350
Oh,
I see.

401
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,940
Wait a minute.
Are you leaving the cat alone by itself 

402
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:33,940
a lot.
No,

403
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,031
I mean the dogs just hanging out with 
ron's dog at her house so they can play 

404
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:38,880
it again.
But you ever had varans house and you're

405
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:40,780
not at your house for extended periods 
of time?

406
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,500
No,
not more than a day or so.

407
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,030
I think that's what it is,
but yeah,

408
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,700
I've left use in a day.
I left them for weeks,

409
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,320
but he knows the dogs.
Not all lonelier.

410
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,390
Weirdly.
the only got two cats.

411
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,680
They like the adults or hate each other 
though?

412
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,980
No.
Just implements and old lady cranky.

413
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,530
Oh,
she hates the other one though.

414
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,440
She's all for everyone.
Everyone hates the dog.

415
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:07,520
Hates most people would've said fucking 
old cats get fucking.

416
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,740
Either they stay cool or they just 
become a cycling.

417
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,740
Chicks get old.
When they get like 45,

418
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,320
they start hating 20 year olds.
Really normal.

419
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,930
It's in dogs to uphold the.
Oh man.

420
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:25,931
People get real angry.
Women get angry when you don't want to 

421
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:25,931
fuck them anymore,
so we're thing,

422
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:30,640
especially if they've.
They've put like a big part of who they 

423
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,040
are in that vested in that the big part 
of their identity and people want that.

424
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,030
I'm hot or whatever that is.
Yeah.

425
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,340
When that shit goes away,
man,

426
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:39,200
it's rough.
You better kesha,

427
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,240
you imagine.
I would have loved to have seen.

428
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:42,450
What would that.
Do you remember what?

429
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,810
Who's that woman?
She was in body heat.

430
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:47,450
Kathleen turner.
Turner.

431
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,650
You remember what she looked like when 
she was young?

432
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,860
She was romancing the stone.
Yes,

433
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,560
so I think body heat was always that.
Sharon stone.

434
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,820
Sharon stone,
romancing the stone.

435
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,710
She was one of them.

436
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,450
She was the fake one with Michael 
Douglas.

437
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,100
Both the same people.
Was it for the roses came later?

438
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,910
No,
there was a,

439
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:10,911
there was like two.
I guess I'm thinking that romancing the 

440
00:18:10,911 --> 00:18:11,270
stone was like a fake Indiana jones in 
my head.

441
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,740
It was like a comedy and I just remember
sliding down the legs and between the 

442
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,621
heads.
I feel like there was a fake one with 

443
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:21,621
um,
Sharon Stone,

444
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,630
like a similar.
Maybe that's body.

445
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:24,630
No,
no,

446
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:24,960
no,
no,

447
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:25,410
no,
no.

448
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:28,500
I mean like a similar sort of like 
romance,

449
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,140
sort of swashbuckler adventure type 
movie.

450
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:36,141
Like really similar.
I know you only thing I remember elsie 

451
00:18:36,141 --> 00:18:36,141
did with sliver and it was just like,
I was like,

452
00:18:36,141 --> 00:18:40,480
oh,
she was so basic instinct and it's 

453
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,970
deliberately stepped a letdown.
Total recall that you're like,

454
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
she was barely.
I mean she was in it but not like it 

455
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,000
wasn't like a main.

456
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And you're like,
wait,

457
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,431
who's that girl?
She was so hot in the first basic 

458
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:51,640
instinct,
but in the second one she was so gross.

459
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:57,050
Why?
Because she was trying to be hot and 

460
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,490
sexy again and it was Just like a,
it was like a bomb.

461
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,690
They looked like a bomb that was seconds
fRom going off the shelf breaking apart.

462
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,190
This is the comfort level that you would
have if you fucked her.

463
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,340
It would be that feeling where you would
were terrified that you were going to 

464
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,720
just stick your dick into and she just 
kind of crumbling and her soul would 

465
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,580
screech away.
She crossed her legs.

466
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:22,710
She did that same crossing the legs 
thing and you're like,

467
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,240
fuck,
this is not right.

468
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:32,241
It was like she was trying to be sexy 
and slinky and here's a completely 

469
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:33,630
different kind of sexy that'll older 
ladies have.

470
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,660
They can still pull off some sexy like 
women even in their fifties can still 

471
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:38,660
pull off.

472
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,230
The graduate lady was pretty sexy.
Yeah,

473
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,240
but you got to be like.
You got to slowly creep up on a dude in 

474
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,010
like dear yourself with your affection.
You can't like spread your legs like 

475
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,130
you're 20 anymore.
It doesn't work.

476
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,850
That's.
It's.

477
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,160
Not only does it.
I got to think about how many times have

478
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:58,161
you done that?
How many times have you done that over 

479
00:19:58,161 --> 00:19:58,161
the years?
Do you have creases on the sides of your

480
00:19:58,161 --> 00:20:01,650
thighs from opening your legs as wide as
possible?

481
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:04,500
So many thousands of thousands of times 
a year.

482
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,290
Is that what the fuck is going on here?
You're,

483
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:07,980
you're,
you know,

484
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:09,930
you're 50 years old and you show me your
pussy.

485
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:12,120
Hey,
slow down.

486
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:13,860
That's a jewel.
That's a gift.

487
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,050
Of course it does.
Of course it happens to somewhere.

488
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,020
Of course it happens everywhere in 
boston at the chicken place and all that

489
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,800
crazy redneck later though.
You all through my teens.

490
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,230
I know.
No,

491
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,450
we do not.
We do not.

492
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:32,451
We're all there.
We're just coasting.

493
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,620
She had no idea.
She didn't know what she was showing us.

494
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,570
Was a harsh.
She didn't know.

495
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:44,571
She thought it was something sexy.
Shit.

496
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,340
Breastfed like nine children.
they were monstrous.

497
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,160
They were fat and they were flat at the 
same time.

498
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,550
There were everything.
That's wrong.

499
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,220
A tip.
Do you remember that?

500
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,730
Barely.
I just want us to see them when we had 

501
00:20:59,730 --> 00:20:59,730
to run out the side door.
Yeah.

502
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,400
When?
When the second show.

503
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:05,401
We didn't even stick around.
There was so many knuckleheads in that 

504
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:05,401
crowd.
Stupid fucking room.

505
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:07,090
Horrible.
I was packing up their chinese food.

506
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:09,650
As you're on stage doing jokes,
they're stuck.

507
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,420
Prop brown bags or stuffing them full of
leftover chinese food,

508
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,390
trying to deliver the stuff you've 
worked on for two years.

509
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,210
You sure?
Fair a little bit,

510
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,900
donna.
Me.

511
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:24,901
I had a good time.
You wouldn't go back there and a 

512
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:24,901
headline if they called,
you know,

513
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:28,490
don't ever call you again.
It's not comedy.

514
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,740
No,
I wouldn't go back either.

515
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,020
It wasn't stopped doing those rooms.
Yeah.

516
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:33,430
Well it wasn't the best room.

517
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,510
Dinner grow.
Go on stage.

518
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:37,210
She just stepped right up to take a 
picture with me.

519
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,400
yay.
Alright.

520
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,310
oh,
that's a good picture.

521
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:44,311
I guess it was probably the same girl.
She's walked onstage the middle of my 

522
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:45,190
set and wanted to take a picture.
I'm like,

523
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,130
get the fuck outta here.
WhaT do you.

524
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:54,190
What do you never see anybody outside of
your neighborhood before you have all 

525
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,891
your teeth cache.
The western Massachusetts is very 

526
00:21:58,891 --> 00:21:58,930
tricky.
Parts of it.

527
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:03,100
A beautiful like amherst.
Umass is fucking gorgeous town,

528
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,870
great town.
It's a cool,

529
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:09,871
like it's a really interesting place 
because it's really intelligent and you 

530
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:14,011
know,
because of the college is pretty much 

531
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:15,690
any college town is gonna have a higher 
level of intellect or at least her 

532
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,350
curiosity.
Cambridge great place,

533
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,910
amazing place.
Uh,

534
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:19,480
but that's,
you know,

535
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:21,940
the city of boston essentially.
It's just a suburb of it.

536
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,910
But when you're in boulder,
perfect example,

537
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,200
boulder,
great town,

538
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:28,390
one of the reasons why it's a great town
and so people are so smart,

539
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:30,100
they're just because of the universities
there,

540
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,340
you know,
it always helps having to use a 

541
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,120
university in a town.
But God damn it doesn't make a bunch of 

542
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,060
fucking bleeding hearts to bunch of 
liberal pussies too.

543
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,530
That's the other problems.
Yeah,

544
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:42,760
man,
you can't have it.

545
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,750
Oh yeah.
Rent in town.

546
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,160
There's not a lot of manly intellectuals
in those towns,

547
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,710
you know it because it becomes like,
really,

548
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,410
I want to say manly in,
in,

549
00:22:52,411 --> 00:22:52,820
you know,
like,

550
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:56,080
you know,
if you knew you're good too much,

551
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:57,540
liberally new,
bougie,

552
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,970
because at a certain point you grow up 
to the point where like if you bump into

553
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:01,540
somebody like,
oh,

554
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:02,850
sorry,
I didn't do that on purpose to job.

555
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,430
Okay,
cool.

556
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,120
Sorry about that.

557
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,040
They're just walk away.
You don't have to fucking fight.

558
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,360
Yeah,
I can dummy.

559
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,830
No,
that's not what I mean.

560
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,850
What I mean is there's too many hippies 
as too many people that don't have their

561
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,860
shit together.
There's tOo many people.

562
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:15,430
Like,
man,

563
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,670
I don't even need many men.
I just need this backpack.

564
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,250
And you know,
and people still tolerating those people

565
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:21,640
like,
dude,

566
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:22,300
okay,
yeah,

567
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,640
this is not perfect.
You're right.

568
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:25,540
You're right.
It's not perfect,

569
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,110
but you can't camp here.
Camp camp in front of my house.

570
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:30,700
You gotta get the fuck outta here.
You know this,

571
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,430
there was,
there's too much of that there.

572
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,020
Yeah.
There's too much of people who only want

573
00:23:35,021 --> 00:23:40,021
to look at the super liberal super 
minded point of view and a really 

574
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:40,330
interesting.
There was a,

575
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:42,670
I think are talked about this,
but there was that rick santorum,

576
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:46,190
guy was doing a debate,
not a debate but a

577
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,220
thing when we're sitting in front of a 
really liberal college in New Hampshire 

578
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,120
and he was talking and they were talking
to them about marriage and he's like,

579
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:54,620
I think marriage is between a man and 
woman.

580
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:56,690
There's,
why can't it be between a man and a man?

581
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,310
And he goes,
okay,

582
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,630
what about this?
What about three men?

583
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,820
Is that still marriage?
No,

584
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:02,690
no,
that's different.

585
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:07,930
Well,
who's to say so why can't it be three 

586
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:07,930
men?
And it's a really good point though.

587
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:12,830
Why can't it be.
shouldn't be allowed to say what a dog 

588
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:12,830
is like,
yo,

589
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,350
okay.
Unless you clearly see the dog doesn't 

590
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,350
want it.
But dog,

591
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,960
I don't think so because the dog can't 
say yes I do.

592
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,850
How about a tree?
No man,

593
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,990
she's fine.
Why not?

594
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,530
Human beingS the consent?
Yeah,

595
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,590
a loving union between human beings.
Why can'T you have three?

596
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,810
Why can't you have four or five people 
in worlds?

597
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,330
Embar and what's his name?
Merits.

598
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:36,490
Sandra bernhard of the other lady was 
embark and tom arnold married somebody 

599
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:36,490
else.
Oh really?

600
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,720
Together they married her.
I don't remember that at all.

601
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,910
That's interesting.
Yeah,

602
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,720
but these people didn't want to hear it.
They're like,

603
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:46,220
you know,
you're being irrelevant.

604
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:47,000
He's like,
why?

605
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,580
I'm saying it's a man or woman.
It's been a man or woman for thousands 

606
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,230
of years.
You're saying iT should be a man and a 

607
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,230
man.
And I'm saying,

608
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,230
why not to men what happened?
Why?

609
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,470
How abouT two women?
Three women get married.

610
00:24:57,471 --> 00:24:59,130
can amanda mary,
three women why?

611
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:04,170
And he's right.
Why can't they knOw that they should be 

612
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:04,170
whining problem?
Yeah,

613
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,460
I mean people should.
The social stigma and everYthing,

614
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,630
it should all.

615
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,850
It should take like that's it.
If people go,

616
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
if people look at you and go look at 
this crazy ass hole with his three 

617
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,000
wives,
like I don't even wanna hang around with

618
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
him.
That should be as punishment,

619
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,460
but what I don't get.
Why you shouldn't be allowed to.

620
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,210
Yeah,
exactly.

621
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:23,780
The only punishment should be origin.
People think it's weird.

622
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,630
Those people won't like you.
That's the only punishment,

623
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,780
but these people.
It was really fascinating the way they 

624
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:31,780
were treating that,
that dilemma in the audience.

625
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,690
You know,
they couldn't see that.

626
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,840
It was just as close minded as the 
people.

627
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,720
The guY who was anti gay marriage is 
just as close minded.

628
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,530
They're like,
no,

629
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:42,840
you're being irrelevant.
This is a straw man.

630
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:48,070
Straw man argument to do that stuff.
They told us they're on people that are 

631
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,130
against changing the marriage ideas,
changing gay marriage to to include it.

632
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,110
It's because they valued their type of 
marriage and when you allow other people

633
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:59,540
to enter it,
that is not your type of marriage.

634
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:03,230
The man on one girl like cheapens the 
value of what you have.

635
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,050
I would say that may be true,
but if that was the case,

636
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:08,740
how come nobody got mad at the bachelor 
or who wants to be.

637
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,840
Who wants to marry a millionaire or any 
of those fucking stupid shows.

638
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,880
I mean if anything did devalue what what
marriage is,

639
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,120
it's drive through marriage.
Casinos in vegas.

640
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,130
You didn't like that when they heard 
about it.

641
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,700
Yeah,
but that's totally illegal.

642
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,740
How can we not fighting that could just 
drive into a place and elvis can marry 

643
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,620
you in vegas and holding onto that.
Just holding onto like,

644
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:33,020
it's,
it's just this way.

645
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:34,550
This is what I have in common that you 
don't.

646
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,200
Oh man and a girl.

647
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,500
It's just people are assholes.
They don't care about stupid shit.

648
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,810
If,
why,

649
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,570
why would you care?
You know?

650
00:26:42,571 --> 00:26:47,571
Look,
I don't give a fuck what anybody else 

651
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:47,571
does.
You know,

652
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:50,400
the only reason I got married because it
makes my wife feel good.

653
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:55,610
She likes anybody gets married.
That's why women like the women like 

654
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,611
him,
they like to be able to tell their 

655
00:26:58,611 --> 00:26:59,661
friends are married.
I had kids with her and I'm not going 

656
00:26:59,661 --> 00:26:59,661
anywhere.
I love it.

657
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:01,560
I'm super happy if it's written on paper
or not,

658
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:06,561
I'm not going anywhere.
But when you see things written on 

659
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:06,561
paper,
for some people it has.

660
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:10,080
Leslie is extra significance or 
culturally you're allowed to say,

661
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:11,310
no,
we're married.

662
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,440
You know,
like this is the level of the fact that 

663
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:16,440
you're legally in tangled.
you know?

664
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,201
Even though it's like a ridiculous 
notion to get legally entangled with a 

665
00:27:21,201 --> 00:27:24,141
person,
especially when there's 60 percent of 

666
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:25,280
them get divorced and have to sort out 
there.

667
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Yeah.
Most of the show they have not going to 

668
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,040
last,
but so why should you get involved?

669
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,480
Because you love someone so much that 
that's how mine was.

670
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,280
I'm like,
I'm willing to do your writing forever.

671
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,240
Yeah,
but,

672
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,600
but you know,
in,

673
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,020
in looking at it that way,
you know what I mean?

674
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:45,021
Just in just discussing it,
it's all ridiculous on marriage is 

675
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:45,021
ridiculous.
You.

676
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:48,450
What's what matters is how do you feel 
about a person?

677
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Do you love them?
You love being around him to express 

678
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:53,480
that you have something really special 
together.

679
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,280
Boom.
It doesn't have to be written down and a

680
00:27:55,281 --> 00:28:00,281
button.
A bunch of other assholes get to agree 

681
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:00,281
that you're legit now.
Oh,

682
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:03,690
that's fucking silliness.
And so why would gave people want it?

683
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,390
The only reason is for insurance 
purposes,

684
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:09,360
so sick ones in the hospital,
you know,

685
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:14,361
loved ones,
but you fill it up with a boyfriend and 

686
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:14,361
girlfriend or a best friend.

687
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:14,690
How about if you don't have a loved one 
and um,

688
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,140
I'm immune.
Me or the,

689
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:18,480
I'm the urine,
my only friend in town and if I get sick

690
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:20,080
I'll say,
please contact ari shaffir.

691
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,580
I don't have parents are my best friend.
If you contact him,

692
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,470
why can't you do that?
But if you move in with a chick,

693
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,330
I feel like three weeks,
then you have to go to the hospital.

694
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:27,730
You're like,
ah,

695
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,590
fuck it.
Let her visit.

696
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:29,910
What are you trying to say?
Abortion.

697
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,130
Gay marriage is legal in Canada for the 
board.

698
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,350
Really?
Local.

699
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,220
Don't know though.
Of course it should be illegal.

700
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,240
It of course it's silly,
but of course why that when it devalues 

701
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,271
their marriage,
I feel like the same as when a black 

702
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:47,271
person lives on your block and it 
devalues a property of her home.

703
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:48,390
And that's exactly what you're sort of 
doing.

704
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,010
I don't want them here.
Would,

705
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:53,310
if you know neil tyson moved in on your 
neighborhood,

706
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,210
do you really think that would devalue 
it?

707
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,090
Tyson,
that the really famous astrophysicist.

708
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,260
Oh,
black guy,

709
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,090
brilliant.
Super genius dude.

710
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,100
He never seen him rate youtube property.
Perhaps.

711
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,830
How could it,
he's a super,

712
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,240
super racist,
wouldn't know.

713
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,370
They drive by and go,
oh,

714
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,350
and he has kids and they assume as kids 
will steal.

715
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,020
Sure.
Imagine that like,

716
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,580
fuck,
how long is that going to be fighting as

717
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,620
is that going to be a little bit in my 
block.

718
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,450
It was a nice black family and then 
their kids inherited it after awhile and

719
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:27,960
they had their.
They were a little,

720
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:31,710
I don't know wherever they were from,
but like there are more party people and

721
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:34,500
they had a car parked in,
there were bullet holes in it,

722
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,330
so my mom just start referring to them 
as the murderers,

723
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,630
murderers,
homes.

724
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,330
They had a car with full of holes in it.
God damn it.

725
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:45,870
I didn't see that though.
Holy shit.

726
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,190
Wow.
Who shot at them?

727
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:49,280
Did you ever ask him?
No.

728
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,850
No.
Murderers,

729
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,740
murderers.
I mean,

730
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,990
I didn't think there were murderers but 
not speak casually.

731
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:57,910
Refer to them as how you are trained 
now.

732
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,590
That was in your little head.
It is fascinating how much,

733
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,770
how few white people can relate to like 
really poor black people and crime 

734
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,460
ridden neighborhoods.
Oh,

735
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,710
you know,
like district nine than it is like your 

736
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:13,710
life.
Yeah.

737
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,020
Yeah.
Dude.

738
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,380
Really bad neIghborhoods like you.
You've seen what especially like in 

739
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,860
africa know you've seen the 
documentaries ever seen,

740
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,890
uh,
the vice piece on Liberia into their.

741
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:30,150
Do you want to think it's the end of the
world watched the vice piece in Liberia 

742
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,150
where they're eating irregular 
cannibalism,

743
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,140
warm old,
regular cannibalism in this guy,

744
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:35,500
one of the,
the war they talk about it's children.

745
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,500
They would kill children.
They would go over there and kIll the 

746
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:40,500
children,
sacrifice them,

747
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:40,500
eat their heart.
They were alive,

748
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,920
drink their blood,
do all because it made them.

749
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,440
TheY believe that it made them 
vulnerable and battle.

750
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,720
Charles taylor,
who's a crazy dictator,

751
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:48,760
but nobody knows him just because his 
name is too normal.

752
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,030
Really wasn't it?
he was the dictator in Liberia.

753
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:54,340
There's took power and Charles Taylor 
was vicious.

754
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,850
What a brilliant move.
Just have a really normal way worse than

755
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:59,830
gaddafi or any of these people we 
thought were bad.

756
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,870
Really horrible story.
He let all that stuff.

757
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,830
What was his name again?
Charles?

758
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:06,700
What?
Charles taylor.

759
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,770
Wow.
Maybe not better,

760
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:12,550
but I think that's the guy who makes 
converse all stars.

761
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,180
Chuck taylor.
It wasn't dave librarian.

762
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,940
Charles taylor.
We got it.

763
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:20,470
You nailed it.
paranoid that I got it wrong.

764
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:25,490
It was the 22nd president of Liberia 
from 1997 till his resignation in 2000 

765
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,270
friends and colleagues had to flee.

766
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,290
Really?
Yeah.

767
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,500
Whoa.
Scary fucking place.

768
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,140
She's crisis africa.
Scary.

769
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,840
there's so many spots are so god damn 
scary.

770
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:42,870
do what they want.
Why did your people take down tower 

771
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,050
seven heart?
Well talked about it.

772
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,230
After awhile I realized you know what?
Everything down.

773
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,130
I thought it was an insurance thing and 
ensure thing.

774
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,500
It's like if it's old fucking knock it 
down.

775
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,150
We can't do anything with it goes top to
gone.

776
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,090
Just knock it down.
He just decided to be better.

777
00:31:55,091 --> 00:32:00,091
If it was attended by random like islam,
could you imagine if you actually did 

778
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:02,971
have buildings already set up?
If every building was set up with 

779
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:05,551
explosive,
so at any point they could just look at 

780
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:05,551
it so you don't have to write rig it 
like that was like a thing.

781
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:09,931
Well,
when you want to get your building 

782
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:09,931
demolished,
here's a good thing.

783
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:09,931
You just press this button and the 
ability goes away.

784
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:10,520
You just have to,
you know,

785
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,980
hire some monkeys to fucking pick up the
happiness that you manage them.

786
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:19,981
That's how they did every building they 
couldn't because everybody would be 

787
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:19,981
like,
people will be just trying to get there.

788
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:20,770
Another plane that was supposed to go 
that waY.

789
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,600
Supposedly.
When was that going to happen?

790
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,720
There was a bunch of plans.
One of them that got shot down that was 

791
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,740
supposedly they don't know where that 
was headed.

792
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:31,960
There might've been headed for the white
house.

793
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,310
Yeah,
that's what they said was headed south.

794
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,380
That was 93.
That was the one that they said that the

795
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:38,350
people brought it down,
but the same.

796
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,130
Um.
Yeah.

797
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,030
But um,
uh,

798
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,810
yeah,
rumsfeld actually made a mistake in an 

799
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:46,810
interview and said he got shot down.
Really?

800
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,510
Yeah.
He said,

801
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,180
uh,
you know,

802
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,940
in 93 they shot down a 93 flight.
90 three.

803
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,950
He like said it before.
There's a lot of people that are 

804
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,350
positive that it was shot down because 
of how far the debris was.

805
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:02,530
The debris went as far as like seven 
miles and then they made that let's roll

806
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:06,470
thing.
I've heard that before and my thought on

807
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:11,471
that was like,
that'd be okay if they shut that down 

808
00:33:11,471 --> 00:33:11,471
clearly by the other three,
like it's going to be.

809
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,230
It's going to find is something down.
It's tough choice,

810
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:16,790
but you got to do that.
There were eye witnesses,

811
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,650
this other fighter jets who knows.
Either way it's horrific.

812
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:23,120
If they crashed,
it's horrific.

813
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:28,121
If it got shot down,
but it's somehow or another people want 

814
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:28,121
to know about that.
The mystery,

815
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:33,040
the mystery of what happened.
Do you think they were starting to 

816
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,040
hijack somewhere in the middle of mid 
conversation going and you know,

817
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:38,021
they checked my bag,
they checked the whole fucking bag was 

818
00:33:38,021 --> 00:33:42,380
pre nine slash 11 was still too much 
security for a lot of people.

819
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,770
Some people were probably upset,
but my.

820
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,220
My take on it is when bush got on,
when they,

821
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:52,670
when they told the whole story,
the whole let's roll story,

822
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,500
you know that the guy said,
let's roll.

823
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:56,690
As they got out and they were going to 
go fight the terrorists and they brought

824
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:57,170
the plane down.

825
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,500
My bullshit alarm on my bullshit alarm 
was going off.

826
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:08,630
I was like,
this is a story I have no idea,

827
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:11,420
but it does sound like a great story.
This is like Jessica Lynch member.

828
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:15,350
They had that story where they said that
they had rescued her and hail of gunfire

829
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:17,810
because she was being in prison by the 
iraqis and they saved her.

830
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,820
This brave pretty girl.
When it turns out she was actually in a 

831
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:22,910
hospital.
There was no gunfire at all.

832
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,150
Yeah,
it's horseshit shit made about horseshit

833
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,160
story and she came out public with it 
and people gave her death threats 

834
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,790
because she'll against the story.
Yeah.

835
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,750
Oh dude.
She got a lot of death threats.

836
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,630
The story,
her story was quite simple.

837
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:40,631
She got she.
There was some sort of a firefight or 

838
00:34:40,631 --> 00:34:41,090
some sort of a military incident where 
she was injured.

839
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,920
She was brought into a hospital.

840
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,260
They came and got her from the hospital 
and they brought her back home.

841
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,880
Okay.
That's her story.

842
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:49,100
That's what really happened with the 
United States.

843
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:54,101
Said was that they had to go and rescue 
her and they went in guns blazing to go 

844
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:55,180
get one of our own dot,
dot,

845
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:55,420
dot,
dot,

846
00:34:55,421 --> 00:34:55,700
dot,
dot,

847
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:56,650
dot.
And that didn't happen.

848
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,040
Did not happen.
What did happen?

849
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:03,041
Just that.
Just they went and got her at the 

850
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:03,041
hospital.
Oh,

851
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:03,041
they went on.
They got the ones in the hospital,

852
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:07,250
got her,
brought her home and then they choose a 

853
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,710
local hospital.
She was in a hospital in Iraq and they 

854
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,770
concocted a crazy story pretending that 
she was,

855
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,150
you know,
that they had rescued her,

856
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,240
but all day they got their tissues.
And then another example is that the a 

857
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,470
football player,
what the fuck's his name?

858
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,130
Human resources is really gay and he 
says like,

859
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:24,880
I'm a guy that went in there and they 
just destroyed everything was,

860
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,410
you know,
like he just writes these press releases

861
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:32,411
that are just is guy.
I'm sure it's one person.

862
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,410
One group actually gets to decide what 
the story would be,

863
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,070
but the point of it is there's,

864
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,470
there's a fire,
right,

865
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,720
but they made him a hero for me here.
At first.

866
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,560
I think it's normal for them.
It's standard operational procedure for 

867
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,191
them to lie,
so anytime they get a situation to 

868
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,730
bullshit and spin the truth,
it seems to be the precedent.

869
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:55,340
It seems to be what they do.
You know,

870
00:35:55,341 --> 00:36:00,341
when you.
Whenever there's some sort of a 

871
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:00,341
situation and then they tell you a 
story,

872
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:02,490
you can't prove that the let's roll is 
not real Bible.

873
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,500
I didn't have to go down.
That's why I was wondering why that If 

874
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,080
they took over the claim to the bitter 
end and like american,

875
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:13,081
the font,
just somebody dove powell and pow and I 

876
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:14,400
don't know man.
I don't,

877
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,190
you know,
I,

878
00:36:15,191 --> 00:36:17,090
I don't want to believe that,
you know,

879
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,830
I don't want to believe that they would 
lie that much,

880
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,950
but I do believe that they could though,
if they thought it was coming to the 

881
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:24,950
white house,
they would shoot.

882
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,720
You should.
I think you probably should.

883
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,670
Going to get there.
It's going to kill the people anyway,

884
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,910
so you're making a decision to calibra 
failed.

885
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,600
If people can't take control of the jet,
if it does shut three attacks,

886
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,120
right?
Or to go talk to this play,

887
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,250
they have no communication with it.
It's going out of.

888
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:43,340
It's out of where it's supposed to fly.
Yeah.

889
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,650
So if you could pull up the audio,
pull up the audio of donald rumsfeld.

890
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,900
Flight 93.
shot down.

891
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:52,140
Just pull up that donald rumsfeld,
flight 93.

892
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:53,700
Shut down.
I think it's on youtube.

893
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,010
He could of course.
He could have also been a slip.

894
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,380
He could've just.
I fuck up all the time.

895
00:36:58,381 --> 00:37:00,060
I'll say,
I'll say to you,

896
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:00,810
I'll say,
brian,

897
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:02,690
why'd you do that?
he called brian.

898
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,200
I'd be like,
no,

899
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,510
I didn't because you don't even realize 
you did in the military too,

900
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:07,440
right?
What's that?

901
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,360
He served in the military at some point.
Rumsfeld?

902
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,110
No,
never really hawks.

903
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,810
No,
no.

904
00:37:12,811 --> 00:37:13,980
That's the thing about all of them.

905
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:21,790
If the people who bombed the mess hall 
and the people that get the bonding in 

906
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:26,841
Spain or the people who attacked the 
United States in New York shot down the 

907
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,360
plane over Pennsylvania,
pentagon

908
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,090
shot down because he's different.
He's referring to the people who did the

909
00:37:35,091 --> 00:37:36,190
bad things.
Yeah.

910
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,840
That sounds like he was saying brought 
down the plane.

911
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,500
Shot down.
Yeah.

912
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,260
Like they brought it down.
They died,

913
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:45,450
but he was talking about the bad people.
They wouldn't be the ones who would have

914
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:47,240
shot.
That's a bad video.

915
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,290
Okay.
So now we know.

916
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,190
He didn't really say that

917
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:55,200
I smoked mouth poop today by accident.
There is a huge mark about this big 

918
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,491
that's been outside of my back patio for
the last couple of days and it hasn't 

919
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:00,890
moved like a word at all.
So I've been looking at everyday.

920
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,330
I mean as an been,
hasn't moved at all what I was trying to

921
00:38:04,331 --> 00:38:06,490
say that,
but as it moved forward at all,

922
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:12,470
but it was really cool because it's like
there's like a little passe cheetah for 

923
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:16,650
look like cheetah for on it.
Like it would be a chia pet cheetah 

924
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:16,650
cheetah.
That was like,

925
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:21,910
well,
oh I see like the pattern with cheetah 

926
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:24,211
and then there was like these weird 
parts that looked like almost like 

927
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:24,211
feathers have like an hour.
It was just really weird,

928
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:28,150
like looking at it everyday and then 
today I shut the door really hard and it

929
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:31,240
fell down and it just start vibrating 
for about 10 minutes.

930
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:34,000
Like it wasn't dead.
It was just vibrating.

931
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,010
So I'm just sitting there at it and then

932
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,510
it shoots out like this orange 
fluorescent orange thing.

933
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:42,310
I think it was shit,
but it was like fluorescent orange.

934
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:47,311
It looked really weird,
like it didn't look real and then it 

935
00:38:47,311 --> 00:38:47,380
flew away out of nowhere.
So I'm sitting there like,

936
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,410
what the fuck is that orange stuff?
is it shit?

937
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,220
I just flew away.
Yeah.

938
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,280
So it fell to the ground,
had an epileptic seizure for like shit 

939
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,030
all over itself and then flew away.
It's just shit out like a,

940
00:38:57,031 --> 00:39:02,031
like a super,
super small little bubble of like 

941
00:39:02,031 --> 00:39:05,430
fluorescent orange shit.
And so I'm sitting there like playing 

942
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:05,430
with it with a match,
a stick.

943
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:10,430
I'm just looking at the orange and I put
on the end of my cigarette and smoked 

944
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:10,430
it.

945
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,760
I don't know why I did it.
Just to see what would happen.

946
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:17,590
You got a real problem about it.
It was weird looking with orange.

947
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:22,591
C,

Um,

958
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:45,940

959
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:50,160
What does brian do you know the now I

960
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,180
Well,

961
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:55,930
There's a ufc on fox.

962
00:39:55,931 --> 00:40:00,931
So we're at the manhattan center and 
then at the tabernacle in atlanta on 

963
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:01,420
4:20.

964
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,370
Oh shit.
Crazy.

965
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:06,340
I'm trying to do my special.
They're just trying to organize it if as

966
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:07,730
quickly as possible.
August,

967
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,960
it's a little more,
I feel like I have to.

968
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:16,580
I feel like I have to know why not.
You should do That and be there.

969
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,490
Right.
Doug benson does every year.

970
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,720
What types of special?
Every year on the cd on four slash 20,

971
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,980
which is a.
He's no one is more like marijuana 

972
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,400
connected.
IT's inexorable.

973
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,530
You can't pull the marijuana from day.
You can't recognize.

974
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:37,531
Where does doug and the marijuana begin?
Where does the marijuana begin and you 

975
00:40:37,531 --> 00:40:39,420
know doug,
you know what I mean?

976
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,560
This last time,
that last ice house,

977
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:43,270
he seriously,
from the beginning to the end,

978
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,440
did not stop packing bowl,
smoke,

979
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,810
packing,
cold smoke.

980
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,270
Whenever people ask density.
Good.

981
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:48,930
I was like,
what?

982
00:40:48,931 --> 00:40:53,931
You just give them another pipeline,
which is what's really crazy is there's 

983
00:40:55,081 --> 00:41:00,081
like a conspiracy that he doesn't really
smoke weed because I guess he got on 

984
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:02,250
some show somewhere and gave like a 
halfhearted bong hit and nyla.

985
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:06,690
He's not far from the truth.
Fake stoner,

986
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,960
donald sutherland and invasion of the 
bodY snatchers.

987
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,590
When he found a woman at the end,
he pointed her out.

988
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,010
I remember that.
I don't,

989
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,380
I don't think I saw that one.
Well,

990
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:19,680
it's like everybody had become one of 
the aliens,

991
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,450
the been taken over by the body 
snatchers,

992
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,570
but a few people stayed awake and we're 
surviving by,

993
00:41:25,571 --> 00:41:27,280
you know,
by figuring out how to stay awake.

994
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,160
And uh,
this woman came up to donald sutherland,

995
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,020
[inaudible] she's,
you know,

996
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,980
they were in the resistance together and
she was like,

997
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,040
hey,
I finally

998
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,830
got free.
I'm,

999
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:40,090
everything's fine.
And he looked at anybody because he had 

1000
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,821
been taken over and if he saw that the 
body's natural zombie movie or no,

1001
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,280
it's an alien alien.
These pod students dope.

1002
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:52,100
One of the body snatchers with donald 
sutherland is all fucking great movie.

1003
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,170
They did it with.
Not meg.

1004
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,760
Meg tilly.
Yeah,

1005
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,290
tilly.
jennifer tilly.

1006
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:02,740
I think it was meg tilly.
Meg tilly was the real kind of innocent 

1007
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:02,740
one in jennifer tilly who was kind of 
like,

1008
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,270
the dirtier one gets dirty thing was 
meg.

1009
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:07,310
Yeah.
She's apparently sirius pro,

1010
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:07,730
right?
Yeah.

1011
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,120
We met her in open nantha.
Yeah.

1012
00:42:09,121 --> 00:42:09,890
Yeah,
she was cool.

1013
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,910
Um,
uh,

1014
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:15,110
but meg tilly was her sister and her 
sister was the star of the.

1015
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,350
There was a more modern version of 
invasion of the body snatchers.

1016
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,170
Still pretty fucking good.
But god,

1017
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,450
I remember getting like a little action 
movie.

1018
00:42:23,451 --> 00:42:24,510
He,
you know,

1019
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,740
wasn't like as good as the first one 
that donald sutherland.

1020
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:32,741
One is shit that's back when donald 
sutherland was just a fucking killer 

1021
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:35,420
actor to me.
Still is.

1022
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,790
He's still in the house.
Yeah.

1023
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,500
Donald sutherland was fucking awesome 
man.

1024
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,420
That evades the bystanders.
I forgot about that.

1025
00:42:41,421 --> 00:42:43,460
I'm going to see that this week.
That's a good one man.

1026
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,170
And whenever this on netflix,
I saw.

1027
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:47,570
What did I go see the other night?
I saw that.

1028
00:42:47,571 --> 00:42:49,520
Uh oh.
I saw the wolf movie.

1029
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,730
Which one?
American wearing gray gray.

1030
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,300
It was,
it was fun.

1031
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,510
It was fun,
but it made it out like wolves or just 

1032
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:05,490
jacking people left and right up there 
like he was hired to shoot wolves and 

1033
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:08,870
the wolves were like,
we're running at people full clip and he

1034
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:10,790
would take them out like it was a 
sniper.

1035
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:13,460
Like that's one of the opening,
which never happens.

1036
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:16,940
Man.
Wolves don't just run on people so often

1037
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:21,941
that you need a guy with a rifle who's a
sniper picking the wolves off or that's 

1038
00:43:21,941 --> 00:43:23,330
not real,
you know,

1039
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:28,331
so these,
it was weird because like he saves a 

1040
00:43:28,331 --> 00:43:28,331
guy.
Wolf's were like,

1041
00:43:28,331 --> 00:43:30,830
there were like monsters in this movie.
There weren't like wolves.

1042
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,040
They were like,
he took wolves and gave them some.

1043
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:36,650
It was like some unnatural pack of 
wolves.

1044
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:41,300
They behaved completely unnatural.
So it was like it was,

1045
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:42,500
it was,
it was part of it.

1046
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,500
It was hard to swallow.
I would've liked it if they were 

1047
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,481
diseased or turned out.
They had got some fucking crazy 

1048
00:43:49,481 --> 00:43:51,190
radiation or experiments.
Yeah,

1049
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,810
that makes sense.
But instead they try to play it off.

1050
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:58,811
Like these wolves are killing people.
Wolves have only killed 100 people ever 

1051
00:43:58,811 --> 00:43:59,420
in the history of humanity.
Really?

1052
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,480
Yeah.
There's like a website where there's a 

1053
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,461
wikipedia,
but there's also another website that 

1054
00:44:06,461 --> 00:44:06,461
like documents,
wolf,

1055
00:44:06,461 --> 00:44:07,130
human deaths,
and a big majority of them,

1056
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:10,820
I believe are in Russia.
I think in Russia it's more common.

1057
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,520
They got meaner people up there and 
meaner wolves,

1058
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,280
more bad ass thing of,
well,

1059
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:18,530
if a 10th and a guy had been killed and 
he was half of the yellow,

1060
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,420
this is far greater than you ever could 
have imagined.

1061
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:22,250
Yeah.
Well it's super rare.

1062
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,420
There are a woman died like I think in 
2005 or something like that.

1063
00:44:26,421 --> 00:44:27,500
We'll put that in,
in,

1064
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:32,550
in Alaska,
but she was running and I think I think 

1065
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:32,550
if you

1066
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,790
fuck up and you just run by a wolf in 
the wrong time,

1067
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:40,791
they can't help but chase you like a dog
just like a cat with a ball of yarn and 

1068
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:45,080
they'd say that's a big part of a 
mountain lion attacks is people are 

1069
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,530
jogging or people riding bikes and they 
just can't help it.

1070
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:47,850
The mountain lion thinks they're running
away,

1071
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,670
which is the next operating system from 
by the way.

1072
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:53,370
They announced out in mind,
which is so weird.

1073
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,940
It seems like they're getting to the 
bottom of the barrel of cats with apple 

1074
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,990
and the whole cap thing and it's just 
like,

1075
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,730
you know,
android with her other little names that

1076
00:45:04,731 --> 00:45:05,430
they're.
They're just.

1077
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:11,030
They shouldn't even have to see which.
Which product or an animal gets think 

1078
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,660
first or name it after something.
Smartest.

1079
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,320
Fuck.
We'll catch a big on the internet.

1080
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,780
Chimpanzee.
Why can't that be,

1081
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,500
you know,
mac chimpanzee,

1082
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:19,430
cat.

1083
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,710
Maybe that'll be a 20 from then on.
You know what they'll do?

1084
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:23,680
They'll just.
Genetic engine.

1085
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,670
My cats are pretty to look at it.
I don't want to see monkeys.

1086
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:28,710
Love chip and I turn on my coherency.
A big ape.

1087
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,320
I don't really.
I don't want to see a.

1088
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,400
How dare you.
It's like looking at a guy naked.

1089
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,840
I'd rather see a cat.
Really?

1090
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,340
Yeah.
Dude.

1091
00:45:35,341 --> 00:45:37,890
I love looking at chimps.
You don't like looking at champs.

1092
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,290
You're.
You're so weird though.

1093
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:43,710
Do you think that that was part of the 
animal side of?

1094
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,030
No,
I mean like if I see if I,

1095
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:46,170
I,
if I go to the zoo,

1096
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:48,720
I love looking at monkeys and apes.
but your computer,

1097
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:50,130
you don't like it.
If I see it every day,

1098
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:51,210
I don't want to look at monkeys 
everyday.

1099
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,500
That's what a cat's.
Okay.

1100
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,240
Yeah,
I guess he can't look at it.

1101
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,110
I go look at tiger's almost everyday 
because to me they're like avatar.

1102
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,290
That's what I'm saying.
tiger really is like an avatar creature.

1103
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,930
Have tigers didn't exist and it was in 
the movie avatar.

1104
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,470
So gigantic,
gigantic colors are spectacular,

1105
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:12,790
you know,
the whites and the black stripes in the 

1106
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:13,710
yellow and orange,
like tigers are amazing looking like why

1107
00:46:13,711 --> 00:46:15,870
would nature ever want you to be so 
beautiful?

1108
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,900
And that's fucking other animals ways 
of.

1109
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,140
I'm watching out for the tiger.
Protecting myself.

1110
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,890
Yep.
Got handicapped a little bit.

1111
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,800
Yeah.
Maybe he made theSe,

1112
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,510
this guy is so bad ass.
We got to make them really bright.

1113
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,160
It should Be bright.
Then if it was the same thing,

1114
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,990
gorillas don't kill people very rarely.
they killed people.

1115
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:37,500
People fuck up and you know,
jog over a nest or something like that.

1116
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:39,810
but for the most part,
gorilla was vegetarians.

1117
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,420
Yeah.
They eat bamboo and shit.

1118
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:47,421
They don't even eat monkeys.
What do you think about this Virginia 

1119
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:48,140
stuff with abortion?
Fucking crazy illegal.

1120
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,610
Pretty much the trying tO.
Well,

1121
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:52,480
have you heard the,
um,

1122
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,060
the thing about ultrasounds?
Yeah.

1123
00:46:55,470 --> 00:47:00,470
They're saying that you have to get an 
ultrasound before you have any sort of 

1124
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:00,470
procedures because they want you to look
at It.

1125
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:05,290
Yeah.
I want you to recognize tHat that's a 

1126
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:05,290
life form somebody,
somebody,

1127
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,010
somebody said that,
um,

1128
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:08,250
one of the democrats said something 
like,

1129
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:13,251
uh,
this is the first time that we've ever 

1130
00:47:13,251 --> 00:47:15,360
dictated like a medical procedure.
We've cOmmanding a medical procedure.

1131
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:20,410
I'm definitely the weird liNe to cross.
It's a total weiRd line to cross because

1132
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,890
you're a,
you know,

1133
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,900
you're,
you're making the decision for the 

1134
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:26,900
person,
you know,

1135
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:26,900
you're,
you're deciding,

1136
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:26,940
hey,
you have to do that.

1137
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,960
You know,
they could get an ultrasound if they 

1138
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:31,960
want to.

1139
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:31,960
They know they can sit where you're 
making them.

1140
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,210
You're making them look at it.
That doesn't make sense to me.

1141
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:36,880
That doesn't.
I don't see why you one more time before

1142
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:37,550
you do it.
Yeah.

1143
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,880
Why do you,
we know what's going on here.

1144
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,730
The real issue is what's going on here?
What's going on here as you're killing a

1145
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:44,380
baby?
One guy said it.

1146
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:45,930
It goes.
The only reasons it's legal.

1147
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:48,220
One of the republicans only reasons 
legal because,

1148
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:48,860
because,
uh,

1149
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,390
it's for convenience and I was like,
that's true.

1150
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,340
that's what we decided as a society.
Yeah.

1151
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,650
We'll let that go.
Yeah.

1152
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,900
It's a weird line right though,
because at a certain age you can't do it

1153
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:00,790
anymore when somebody is months old.
Weird.

1154
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:02,650
Too crazy.
But that's what we do all the time.

1155
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:05,200
That's when we raise the speed limit.
Fifty miLes an hour when you know,

1156
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:07,690
this is going to mean more deaths.
This year dude,

1157
00:48:07,691 --> 00:48:09,710
I had a friend back in New York who,
uh,

1158
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,090
his girl got a late term abortion really
late,

1159
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,650
like really late,
like it was illegal and it was,

1160
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,750
have the number,
I don't.

1161
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:24,980
It was a,
it was reallY crazy because she was 

1162
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,280
showing really?
Yeah,

1163
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:29,020
she was showing and uh,
and she had an aBortion.

1164
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,270
It's fucking dark man.
It Was dark and they wound on,

1165
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,320
went on to have children together,
which is even good as they went on to 

1166
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,250
have children together.
But at the time I was really freaked out

1167
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:44,251
by.
It really freaked out because I don't 

1168
00:48:44,251 --> 00:48:44,251
remember how many months it was in,
but it was enough where,

1169
00:48:44,251 --> 00:48:45,960
you know,
they told me,

1170
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,770
I was like,
oh shit.

1171
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,200
Like this is dark man.
You know,

1172
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:50,740
it's,
it's,

1173
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:54,160
I think that should be allowed to do.
You should be allowed what to do.

1174
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,640
What do you mean later abortions?
You should be allowed to do them.

1175
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:58,410
No,
no,

1176
00:48:58,770 --> 00:48:59,710
like get them.
Oh,

1177
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:02,230
you should be able to get them to the 
same thing.

1178
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:07,290
There's no reason for that.
Like clearly at some point it's like 

1179
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:07,290
this light is going to continue.

1180
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:08,230
I think Whatever it is right now,
it's fine.

1181
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:13,260
I think that's enough time for you to 
find out that you're pregnant and you 

1182
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:13,260
need to do either make the decision,
yes or no,

1183
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,220
but I think anything after that,
after what?

1184
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,580
Like,
like late term abortions.

1185
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,030
WhaT month is that?
Um,

1186
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,900
I think three is that what it is,
is the longest you can go.

1187
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:24,220
So you know,
I think with late term is six and on.

1188
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,900
No,
I'm saying what it is now.

1189
00:49:26,901 --> 00:49:30,850
It's six months,
six months.

1190
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,320
Jesus christ.
That's a baby.

1191
00:49:32,321 --> 00:49:36,120
People still want to do it at four.
That's crazy.

1192
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,880
That's just to me,
that's crazy.

1193
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:40,710
That's human life.
It's very clearly human life.

1194
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,460
One difference between.
But let me,

1195
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:44,510
let me get.
Let me be real with you here.

1196
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:49,610
Part of part of what you're saying,
you're kind of being objective about it 

1197
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:54,061
and you're being honest about it,
but part of what you're saying is a 

1198
00:49:54,061 --> 00:49:54,061
little bit for shock value,
but no,

1199
00:49:54,061 --> 00:49:55,510
four months while you can't even see a 
bulge at that point.

1200
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:56,140
Oh yes,
you can.

1201
00:49:56,350 --> 00:50:01,350
Yes.
For months never been in a science 

1202
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:01,350
museum,
so,

1203
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:02,450
but three months you can't,
but for months you can.

1204
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:06,520
You can as well look this up.
I think three months again as well,

1205
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:08,460
so then you can see it,
but it's still okay to do it that way.

1206
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,610
OkaY.
Let's look at fetus.

1207
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:12,940
I think it's remarkably soon that you 
could tell it's person.

1208
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,780
You've seen a baby's butt hole before 
you just brand.

1209
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,990
So when would you think it should be 
illegal?

1210
00:50:20,991 --> 00:50:22,540
As soon as you can see any sort of 
bulge.

1211
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,070
Yeah,
look at this three months,

1212
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:25,600
dude,
but that's what you're saying.

1213
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:27,620
That's when you think it should be gone.
This is three weeks.

1214
00:50:27,621 --> 00:50:28,060
This is.
I mean,

1215
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,320
this is 13 weeks.
This stuff.

1216
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:34,160
That's a baby man.
It's a fucking baby sucking its stomach.

1217
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,890
Three months.
Can you see it through the stomach?

1218
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,510
Can you see a bulge in the woman's 
stomach?

1219
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:44,020
Now I want to just show me a picture of.
I don't know how much blown that up 

1220
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,020
maybe.
I think for different.

1221
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,020
some women.
Yeah.

1222
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,500
So,
okay.

1223
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,860
You're saying that's too far.
That's too far.

1224
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,980
And it's like how far that sound by the 
way.

1225
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,380
That's image.
This is a real image.

1226
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,330
This is an image of what it's 
represented.

1227
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,570
This is what it looks like.
Yeah,

1228
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,650
it's a human life,
but it's like almost immediately,

1229
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,440
um,
you're saying with our,

1230
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:03,010
with our current microscopic,
uh,

1231
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:08,710
like abilities.
As soon as you can make it out based on 

1232
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:08,710
that,
that's how it should be illegal.

1233
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:09,500
That's where it's life.
Well,

1234
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:10,540
it's interesting.
That's the,

1235
00:51:10,541 --> 00:51:12,230
that's a really good question.
So random.

1236
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:15,320
It is a really good question,
but at what Point in time does it become

1237
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:20,321
a life?
Does it become a life when it's two 

1238
00:51:20,321 --> 00:51:20,321
sales?

1239
00:51:20,321 --> 00:51:22,270
No,
is it 20 cells and I think as soon as 

1240
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:22,490
they start moving on its own,
so it was it going to leak.

1241
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,400
It can start leading to life and it's 
like life,

1242
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,950
but it's life inside you,
man.

1243
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:29,300
When you,
when you have children,

1244
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:32,120
when your wife is pregnant or if you 
ever have a girl that's pregnant,

1245
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,360
you touch your stomach.
When you know the baby's only a few 

1246
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:37,360
months old,
they start kicking man.

1247
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,390
So it's when you can feel it through the
stomach skin.

1248
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,400
I mean that's some living thing inside 
of her.

1249
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,220
I don't know where you can feel it like 
the week before you can feel it.

1250
00:51:43,221 --> 00:51:44,660
That's not a living thing.
Um,

1251
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:49,690
no,
it's still living is not quite strong 

1252
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:49,690
enough to get through the skin layer.
It's moving.

1253
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:49,690
I'm saying it's,
it's a,

1254
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,610
it's a living thing,
mean living way before that,

1255
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:53,270
but it can't.

1256
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:58,300
It can't.
Like you don't know that it's moving 

1257
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,221
around until you start suits,
when you can feel that's what you think 

1258
00:52:00,221 --> 00:52:00,221
is true.
When I was just saying hand,

1259
00:52:00,221 --> 00:52:04,901
you should feel totally on its moving 
long before this late term abortion 

1260
00:52:04,901 --> 00:52:05,570
shit.
It's moving,

1261
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,200
you know,
I don't know when you should be able to 

1262
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:11,200
draw a line,
but it is a.

1263
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:11,600
It's a philosophical in a moral 
question,

1264
00:52:11,601 --> 00:52:16,601
right?
It's like what time does it become a 

1265
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:16,601
life and no one is really wrapped their 
head around that,

1266
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:20,981
but for a lot of liberal people,
they don't even want to address the 

1267
00:52:20,981 --> 00:52:22,580
argument.
IT becomes more of of you trying to take

1268
00:52:22,581 --> 00:52:26,270
away a woman's right to choose.
We'll look at their names and the tooth,

1269
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:27,770
but the tooth,
but not even against each other.

1270
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,800
One is pro life.
The others not anti-life.

1271
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:31,370
Right.
And one is pro choice.

1272
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:33,410
The other one's not against people 
having choices.

1273
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,640
Yeah,
but it's the choice to kill you.

1274
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:36,260
That's my choice.
Yeah.

1275
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:41,261
But that one prolife once a month and I 
haven't talked about the same things 

1276
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:44,730
sort of they are though with what's 
really crazy is the most pro life people

1277
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:46,490
are also pro war.

1278
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,590
It's one of the funniest things ever,
man.

1279
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:52,490
This is the weirdest thing ever.
How many.

1280
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:57,491
I mean the numbers are staggering.
How manY people are concerned about the 

1281
00:52:57,491 --> 00:52:58,670
babies and how many people are out there
and they're the same people that support

1282
00:52:58,671 --> 00:53:01,430
the war and the same people that would 
be happy to,

1283
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,020
you know,
to support the troops.

1284
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,280
Did you ever more troops?
You ever have a um,

1285
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,960
drive by one of those,
a bunch of groups of fucking weirdos get

1286
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:11,650
on the corner with flags and big signs,
honk,

1287
00:53:11,651 --> 00:53:12,860
confused,
support our troops.

1288
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:15,680
Like,
how is this helping anybody at all?

1289
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:20,710
How has this,
how is this boosting morale for people 

1290
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:21,350
who aren't really there is it,
is it for the random soldier to that may

1291
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:23,810
be getting shipped off and gets to see 
this before they leave?

1292
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,410
What is this for?
Is some

1293
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,330
kind of rah rah,
rah.

1294
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:27,960
Dedicated.
What do you,

1295
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,190
what do you think this is?
Yeah,

1296
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:30,990
but people do get mad at you if you 
don't honk.

1297
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,080
I've seen there was,
um,

1298
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:35,490
on the corner about three or four miles 
away from here.

1299
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,640
There was this one intersection that was
like a hot intersection for some reason 

1300
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,210
for gaY marriage folks.
People that were anti gay marriage and 

1301
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:48,230
people that were into the war for same 
corner and the one member of that 

1302
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:50,160
proposition eight shit,
when that was going down,

1303
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,890
they were all just lined up.
You know,

1304
00:53:52,891 --> 00:53:57,891
marriage is between a man and a woman 
and god is not in the fucking quoting 

1305
00:53:57,891 --> 00:54:00,050
psalms and shed and holding it up.
Punk if you believed marriages for a man

1306
00:54:00,051 --> 00:54:02,750
and woman and the other time was this 
war thing.

1307
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:07,070
People were fucking screaming at them.
You know,

1308
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,360
people screaming at each other know,
get the fuck out of America.

1309
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:14,970
There was several times where I drove by
where people in cars,

1310
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:17,820
we're screaming at the people on the 
street and they were screaming

1311
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:22,950
back and forth at each other was just 
arrest him because it's against the law 

1312
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:23,760
for you to honk your horn,
so telling people to honk your horn,

1313
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,590
be against the law to honk your horn.
It is.

1314
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:30,650
Why do you have a horn?
It's only no way you can get a ticket 

1315
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:34,420
for a honking horn for no reason really,
for no reason to go.

1316
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:40,020
Maybe you saw some shit right there.
I thought I saw some shit.

1317
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,090
What's the reason you see that guy?
The guy that was coming?

1318
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:47,130
No,
the other lane that was coming towards 

1319
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:47,130
me.
There's someone who's headlight.

1320
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:50,310
Yeah,
but still it's telling you to do 

1321
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:50,480
something illegal and people holding 
signs up for that.

1322
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:55,490
Really illegal.
I feel like that's one of those myths 

1323
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:57,480
and I feel like you should be able to 
like drive through an intersection and 

1324
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:57,480
honk and your friends.

1325
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:02,710
Can you do that?
I think it's one of those things where 

1326
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:04,221
it's like it's illegal,
but no one's ever going ticket for it 

1327
00:55:04,221 --> 00:55:04,221
unless you've started just honking your 
horn for no reason.

1328
00:55:04,221 --> 00:55:09,021
If you saw someone in the corner and 
there was a cop there and you are brett 

1329
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:09,021
brown,
what's up?

1330
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:09,021
You know?
Do you think,

1331
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,070
have you been arrested for that?
Is that what you would say?

1332
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,860
Get arrested but get ticket.
You get fined probably or a warning.

1333
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:17,510
Most likely we got too many rules.
There's way too many.

1334
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:20,310
If that really is a law that's.
That's pathetic.

1335
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:22,920
I mean,
you shouldn't be a con.

1336
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,870
You shouldn't be blaring.
You're fucking hormone everywhere,

1337
00:55:24,871 --> 00:55:29,871
but there shouldn't be a law against it.
Here's a really interesting video 

1338
00:55:29,871 --> 00:55:29,871
online.
Um,

1339
00:55:29,871 --> 00:55:34,480
it was taken in Nevada where some dude 
went through a sobriety checkpoint and 

1340
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,910
wouldn't answer any of the questions.
I remember that.

1341
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:40,970
Did you see it go,
I know my rights to roll down your 

1342
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:40,970
window to place it goes.
Is that a direct command or not?

1343
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,600
I think I was like,
please hold on your window is like,

1344
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,500
no,
I will not.

1345
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,020
It just kept standing there like,
oh bang,

1346
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:46,650
that is

1347
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:51,860
you're.
There's actually a few of those videos 

1348
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:51,860
online.
But uh,

1349
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:51,860
that is what,
you know,

1350
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:52,220
when,
when a cop says,

1351
00:55:52,221 --> 00:55:53,930
you know,
I want to check your car.

1352
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:58,190
Yeah.
You don't have to say yes or say no.

1353
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:00,420
No,
no.

1354
00:56:00,421 --> 00:56:02,430
They don't.
They say an asking matter.

1355
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:04,200
Ma'am,
could you please open the car door?

1356
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:06,360
You have to say,
all right,

1357
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:07,590
we're going to check your car.
Okay.

1358
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:13,070
Not okay.
In the end is really imPortant because 

1359
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:13,070
you go,
oh,

1360
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:13,070
no,
no,

1361
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:13,840
you're not going to check my car.
Alright,

1362
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:14,790
we're gonna.
Bring the dogs.

1363
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Go get your dog.
That's procedures that we need to do 

1364
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,240
some weird dude check in my trunk.
Yeah.

1365
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:25,550
They have to ask in a way that's asking 
that Donald Trump,

1366
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:31,250
they can't say that.
The problem is they'll just get the dog 

1367
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:31,360
and then they have a dog.
They make the dog bark and go,

1368
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:31,950
yep.
Alright,

1369
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,400
we're checking your car.
Now if the.

1370
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:38,520
Well,
how many do you think cops actually 

1371
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:38,520
plant evidence?
Do you think that's not.

1372
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,020
I don't think they plant evidence.
The majority.

1373
00:56:41,021 --> 00:56:43,120
I'm sure they have plants in it.
Evidence,

1374
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:47,670
but cops planting evidence.
Humongous majority.

1375
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:52,000
Never planted any evidence.
I mean everyone says the cop is planting

1376
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:57,001
evidence,
but you know that fucking guys just 

1377
00:56:57,001 --> 00:56:57,001
like,
why would I do that?

1378
00:56:57,001 --> 00:56:59,650
Now you remember that movie cocaine 
cowboys.

1379
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,120
do you remember that movie?
That

1380
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:06,130
was the movie of the documentary about 
the eighties in miami and how fucking 

1381
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,980
crazy the cocaine world was.
Do you remember that shIt?

1382
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:13,460
One of the things we've talked about was
that there was one year that were an 

1383
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,090
entire class of the police academy,
the graduating class.

1384
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:19,890
All of them either wound up dead or 
wound up in jail for corruption.

1385
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:24,950
Really all the.
The whole police after a while where 

1386
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:26,340
they all just like tell the other ones 
is how we do stuff.

1387
00:57:26,341 --> 00:57:27,080
I'm like,
all right,

1388
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:27,890
this is way.
It's done well.

1389
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:32,910
Especially the money amount of money 
that's involved in cocaine in miami and 

1390
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:36,141
the eighties.
It must've been fucking completely 

1391
00:57:36,141 --> 00:57:36,141
crazy.
There's a lot of good cops.

1392
00:57:36,141 --> 00:57:37,230
Most cops are good cops.
The problem is,

1393
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,780
look,
there's most people are great.

1394
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,090
You knoW,
most people that I meet day to day in my

1395
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:43,920
life are,
are fine folk.

1396
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:49,130
There's only occasionally one or two 
people out of a vast majority that suck 

1397
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,380
and those stand out and you go off.
Fucking people suck.

1398
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,620
But for the most part,
look in America and you know,

1399
00:57:55,621 --> 00:58:00,621
in a nice place like los angeles where 
people are doing pretty good for the 

1400
00:58:00,621 --> 00:58:00,621
most part.
I mean,

1401
00:58:00,621 --> 00:58:01,110
you know,
we're not starving to death.

1402
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:03,300
People were pretty god damn nice.
It's pretty civil.

1403
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:04,890
Most people are cool.
You know,

1404
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,380
the majority,
the vast majority are cool,

1405
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,350
but if a few of them are cons you'll 
start going.

1406
00:58:10,351 --> 00:58:14,370
People are going to the same thing with 
our so hard,

1407
00:58:14,371 --> 00:58:16,770
but it's like some do but some don't at 
all.

1408
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,600
You know,
one of what I was going to say about the

1409
00:58:18,601 --> 00:58:23,601
video where the cop was talking to the 
guy and the guy wouldn't answer any 

1410
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:28,011
questions.
One of the things that was interesting 

1411
00:58:28,011 --> 00:58:28,011
about it was a fucking together.

1412
00:58:28,011 --> 00:58:28,011
The cops were keeping him.
Well,

1413
00:58:28,011 --> 00:58:30,030
this count as being kind of shitty.
I was like,

1414
00:58:30,031 --> 00:58:31,770
I guess they knew they were being filmed
or something.

1415
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,260
Yeah.
There was a little bit of that too,

1416
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:39,261
because he had a camera and you're going
to get to the asking them where they're 

1417
00:58:39,261 --> 00:58:39,261
pulling together.
Yeah.

1418
00:58:39,261 --> 00:58:41,520
Both the two cops,
his supervisor came over as well know,

1419
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:46,910
you know,
but they're just trying to make sure 

1420
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:46,910
people aren't drunk.
You know,

1421
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:49,500
love.
When they get caught with the camera 

1422
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:49,500
that's in their own car,
they were like,

1423
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:49,500
you know,
that's their.

1424
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,190
Yeah,
they're dumb and it's just like,

1425
00:58:50,191 --> 00:58:52,800
do you get so complacent that you just 
feel like what you're doing is right?

1426
00:58:52,801 --> 00:58:54,540
I feel like they're gonna be able to 
erase the evidence.

1427
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,010
HoW old is this stuff?
I don't know.

1428
00:58:56,011 --> 00:58:57,800
It's probably a decade.
A decade old.

1429
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:58,800
Do you think it works?

1430
00:58:58,860 --> 00:58:59,730
Yeah,
it tastes shitty.

1431
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,590
Shitty.
But you think it's getting you high?

1432
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:06,620
Probably still pretty high.
There's a place down the street that 

1433
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,140
used to be one of those,
um,

1434
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:09,960
urgent care centers and now as a medical
marijuana place,

1435
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:14,180
really not so urgent care.
He didn't,

1436
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:19,550
wasn't a lot of money in that.
Now they prescribed we'd licenses to so 

1437
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:21,680
many of those billboards.
Were you driving around people who don't

1438
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:23,180
live in la?
I have no idea.

1439
00:59:23,181 --> 00:59:26,750
What the fuck is going on here.
This pLace is correct.

1440
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,200
There is maybe denver.
Denver's really close.

1441
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:31,440
Dennis is just like this,
right?

1442
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:36,450
Like there's a bunch of areas in dental 
strip for the farmers is a place that 

1443
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:39,161
opened,
like they're opening across from each 

1444
00:59:39,161 --> 00:59:39,161
other across,
from each other.

1445
00:59:39,161 --> 00:59:39,161
They're like there.
It's ridiculous.

1446
00:59:39,161 --> 00:59:43,751
It's one of the craziest things you've 
ever experienced your life and it's one 

1447
00:59:43,751 --> 00:59:46,931
of the reasons why so many of them are 
getting shut down when people don't 

1448
00:59:46,931 --> 00:59:46,931
realize how many of them there are.

1449
00:59:46,931 --> 00:59:48,020
When you hear about all these pot shops 
getting shut down,

1450
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,120
it's terrible.
The pot shops are getting shut down.

1451
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:51,140
Absolutely.
It's terrible.

1452
00:59:51,141 --> 00:59:56,141
They're being prosecuted.
Especially the people that didn't even 

1453
00:59:56,141 --> 00:59:56,141
do anything wrong.
There's a bunch of people that are being

1454
00:59:56,141 --> 01:00:00,880
unfairly targeted,
but there's also a bunch of dudes are 

1455
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:00,880
making a shitload of money.
Someone we'd.

1456
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:03,560
They would have been in porn.
There's some people that it's like,

1457
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:05,510
you can't even.
You can't even open a shoe store without

1458
01:00:05,511 --> 01:00:06,590
filling paperwork.
Yeah,

1459
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:07,640
but they're like,
fuck it.

1460
01:00:07,641 --> 01:00:10,220
We're selling weed and you're like,
can't do that.

1461
01:00:10,221 --> 01:00:11,930
Doesn't give You a license to do 
nothing.

1462
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:16,960
Like our douchey friend that we were 
talking about that left his job and now 

1463
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,880
is making tons of money selling weed.
It's like he's no shining light of 

1464
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,000
psychedelic live.
He's like,

1465
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:23,630
he's a farmer,
he's a farmer,

1466
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:24,260
he's a.
He's a.

1467
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:29,580
He's a farmer.
What's cool is that place that's an ad 

1468
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,870
next to the ice house,
you can actually rent a space and grow 

1469
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:31,870
weed there.
Oh,

1470
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:33,730
and they gave you chemicals that go real
cooperate.

1471
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:37,040
Yeah.
It's like a place for rent and grow your

1472
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,230
own shit.
Community gardens,

1473
01:00:39,231 --> 01:00:43,130
but only for a week or so.
Dope to America.

1474
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:48,570
Yeah.
We're going to have to have those guys 

1475
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:49,721
come on the show,
but I don't know if they want to go 

1476
01:00:49,721 --> 01:00:49,721
public works guys.
The guys from that place,

1477
01:00:49,721 --> 01:00:51,320
from that community garden as a run that
place.

1478
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,820
We'll have them come on with anonymous 
masks.

1479
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:53,750
You ask him.
It's like,

1480
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:54,920
do you want to.
Do you want to do it?

1481
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,900
Here's what.
I wouldn't do it.

1482
01:00:56,901 --> 01:00:59,810
If I was them,
I'd want to stay as low key as an owner.

1483
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:04,811
I know.
Look what you break down everything 

1484
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:04,811
because.
No,

1485
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:04,811
no,
no,

1486
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:04,811
I couldn't.

1487
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:07,390
No,
I don't want to call tHat kind of 

1488
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:07,390
attention to me.
Yeah.

1489
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:09,341
You don't want anybody looking at you as
the target because like I had that guy 

1490
01:01:09,341 --> 01:01:09,341
from oaksterdam and an oakland.
He doesn't mind.

1491
01:01:09,341 --> 01:01:11,180
He likes being a public spokesman.
Yeah,

1492
01:01:11,181 --> 01:01:16,181
but I mean,
haven't they gone after him a bunch of 

1493
01:01:16,181 --> 01:01:16,181
times?
Probably.

1494
01:01:16,181 --> 01:01:16,270
I think there's a big issue right now 
with um,

1495
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,260
their,
what they're allowed to write off.

1496
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:21,020
Like it's not like a regular business.
They're not allowed to write off,

1497
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:23,270
they won't take tax on it.
So I thought that's we're just trying to

1498
01:01:23,271 --> 01:01:25,900
make illegal legal to take taxes,
but they don't take,

1499
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,640
they must be taking some taxes from 
medical weed.

1500
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:31,520
I think it's a huge form of tax revenue,
isn't it?

1501
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,620
Medical weed.
I know they said they on their own.

1502
01:01:33,621 --> 01:01:38,240
They said we're going to pay taxes,
let's find a medical marijuana tax.

1503
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:43,390
Taxation tax revenue.
What about in like are they now paying 

1504
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:50,681
tax because I have to.
Or are they just doing it because they 

1505
01:01:50,681 --> 01:01:50,681
let's find out.
Oh,

1506
01:01:50,681 --> 01:01:50,681
I'm here.
It's still.

1507
01:01:50,681 --> 01:01:51,290
And voters approve it.
Okay.

1508
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,300
So they had to approve it.
This is what it is.

1509
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:57,550
Voters had to approve marijuana tax.
Revenue measure measure.

1510
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:01,790
Sixty percent of voters decided tuesday 
to honor measure m,

1511
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:06,850
a city.
What major am who am with a citywide 

1512
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:11,890
ballot measure that imposes new taxes on
the sales of medical marijuana at brick 

1513
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:14,120
and mortar dispensary's?
It allows city tax,

1514
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:17,270
brick and mortar dispensary's $50 out of
each one.

1515
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:21,690
Thousand in gross reimbursements.
So that's five percent.

1516
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:24,210
$50 out of $100,
isn't it?

1517
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:25,300
It's five percent.
Yeah.

1518
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,320
So how much will they already get?
Five percent is what their taxes.

1519
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,720
That's pretty good.
Sales tax is eight point two.

1520
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:32,580
five data.
It's on top of that I think.

1521
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,170
Oh really?
Think this is a city tax.

1522
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:36,360
Marijuana,
los angeles,

1523
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:38,370
marijuana tax,
whatever man.

1524
01:02:38,371 --> 01:02:43,371
Pay the tax you get in to make a fucking
shitload of money and you're spreading 

1525
01:02:43,371 --> 01:02:43,560
that love.
Pay the tax.

1526
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:48,620
That's what I would say.
They're making plenty of money or they 

1527
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:49,160
are a little bit less hollywood lawyer.
Prices a little already.

1528
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,200
Just stepped up.
I feel are just starting to get out of 

1529
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:54,270
hand.
Receives a joke.

1530
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:55,170
Tell me,
tell me.

1531
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,230
Pharmacies are $75 for an eighth and 
it's not that good.

1532
01:02:58,231 --> 01:02:59,700
It's like good.
It's good.

1533
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,510
Homeboy sold me an ounce for how much 
was it to 60?

1534
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,950
To 50 to 50.
Shit puts you straight up.

1535
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,190
That's my favorite.
That's my favorite.

1536
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,100
That's my favorite with his oji.
Kush is just the greatest.

1537
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:12,900
Yeah,
you bypass the stores,

1538
01:03:12,901 --> 01:03:17,901
but I.
I support the stores because I want to 

1539
01:03:17,901 --> 01:03:17,901
be able to go to them.

1540
01:03:17,901 --> 01:03:21,720
It makes sense.
I know that if I go straight to the 

1541
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:21,720
grower,
you're going to be a lung support.

1542
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,080
Great weed smoker.
That guy gives you on wholesale prices.

1543
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:28,390
Yeah.
I don't need to make that money that 

1544
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:28,390
bad.
I would.

1545
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:30,800
I would rather give that extra 100 bucks
or whatever to the store so that they 

1546
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:30,930
can make some profit and they can keep 
open.

1547
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:33,210
I like to conduct.
Can't make a profit that I supposedly.

1548
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,140
They're not allowed to make profit,
but yeah,

1549
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:36,460
I just read something like that.
They were like,

1550
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,480
that's completely wrong.
Is it that just read that where they're 

1551
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:41,480
like,
that's absolutely wrong.

1552
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,960
That's just a misinterpretation that 
this rule.

1553
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:45,360
I just read something.
It's in the recent.

1554
01:03:45,361 --> 01:03:46,350
Like web,
huh?

1555
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,150
Yeah.
Was on dick.

1556
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,670
I thought they weren't allowed to make 
profit,

1557
01:03:50,671 --> 01:03:52,050
but they were allowed to be like,
all right,

1558
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,880
you're getting paid $30 an hour.

1559
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:59,090
You weight goes is you're not allowed to
make profit like a normal corporation 

1560
01:03:59,090 --> 01:03:59,160
would,
but would.

1561
01:03:59,161 --> 01:04:02,460
The way you can do it is you can take a 
salary,

1562
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,680
you know,
like say if you run the place,

1563
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:07,740
you could take a salary which is 
commensurate for someone who would be in

1564
01:04:07,741 --> 01:04:11,100
your type of business so you could make 
a salary of $100,000

1565
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:16,101
a year and weigh a ton.
Mccormick was telling me one of the 

1566
01:04:16,101 --> 01:04:16,710
things that they do is,
especially at osha damn guy,

1567
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:21,950
they funnel a lot of the money back into
the community and the source of a 

1568
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:24,690
charity and the in the form of charity 
in the form of grants.

1569
01:04:24,691 --> 01:04:29,691
They do a lot of different things with 
their money and the guy who runs it 

1570
01:04:29,691 --> 01:04:30,390
takes a salary,
pays all the employee's salary,

1571
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:33,030
but you're not allowed to strictly get 
rich off it.

1572
01:04:33,031 --> 01:04:33,750
You can't make.

1573
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,110
It's not like the guy who owns it can 
make 60 percent of the profits.

1574
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:40,290
You can make as much as you want.
Really?

1575
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:42,540
There wasn't nothing else.
Not wIth mccormick was telling me.

1576
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:44,070
He was telling me he can't.
Fuck.

1577
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:49,071
I wish I could.
He was telling me that you have to have 

1578
01:04:49,071 --> 01:04:49,071
it,
you have to,

1579
01:04:49,071 --> 01:04:49,071
you take a salary and that's how it 
works.

1580
01:04:49,071 --> 01:04:51,360
That's what your profit is.
just your salary and you know,

1581
01:04:51,361 --> 01:04:52,560
you could,
but you could still,

1582
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:55,080
you know,
a salary for a business that size,

1583
01:04:55,081 --> 01:05:00,081
like what's,
what is commensurating a few hundred 

1584
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:00,081
thousand dollars a year.
I'm sure you know,

1585
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:02,490
I mean if you were running,
you haul fucking empire,

1586
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:03,150
you would,
you know,

1587
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:05,490
which is dealing with the same amount of
money or something.

1588
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,530
You halls a terrible example,
but you know what I'm saying?

1589
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,500
You'd make a good,
good chunk of change.

1590
01:05:10,501 --> 01:05:12,870
You know,
a ceo for some big fucking company makes

1591
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:17,871
a lot of goddamn money.
If you're a ceo for some giant 

1592
01:05:17,871 --> 01:05:18,040
collective that's

1593
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,860
responsible for millions of dollars 
worth of business every year,

1594
01:05:20,861 --> 01:05:22,640
you should be gettIng paid well,
right?

1595
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:27,860
Yeah.
Well that's what the ceos of the banks 

1596
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:28,810
did.
There's rules,

1597
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:35,010
there's rules,
there's not enough rules as far as like 

1598
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:37,690
protecting the environment and too many 
rules when it comes to everything else.

1599
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,620
God daMn twat rockets.
It got a psvt joe.

1600
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,180
This came out yesterday.
It's actuallY,

1601
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:45,370
it doesn't come out until the 22nd.
Is this a video game?

1602
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,070
But this is the new thing all the kids 
are talking about.

1603
01:05:48,071 --> 01:05:53,071
It's a new game boy,
new playstation thing and it's going to 

1604
01:05:53,071 --> 01:05:57,280
get into it.
ToUch screen on the back and the front 

1605
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,470
back.
it's got three g building a back is just

1606
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,680
has a panel in.
It's just touch sensitive.

1607
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:04,100
So like,
yeah,

1608
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:09,190
so you can use with your steering.
Well and it's also got double joysticks 

1609
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:13,380
and check this out.
It's got touch screen in the front 

1610
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:13,380
finally.

1611
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:14,080
Uh,
it's pretty cool.

1612
01:06:14,081 --> 01:06:15,730
I've only got to play with it a little 
bit today.

1613
01:06:15,731 --> 01:06:17,290
I have an unboxing video,
death squad,

1614
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:20,620
that tv doing a review.
It's called the psvt.

1615
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,810
And,
and what kind of games you get into this

1616
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:23,830
sucker.
What school is it?

1617
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:27,400
The graphics are amazing,
like they look like a home console video

1618
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:32,401
game and you can do your netflix on here
and since it has three g you can do all 

1619
01:06:32,401 --> 01:06:32,740
the,
all the stuff that you can do,

1620
01:06:32,741 --> 01:06:37,741
like on a tablet,
it has two cameras and surf the web on 

1621
01:06:37,741 --> 01:06:40,480
the camera front and the back and 
everything was about her life.

1622
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:43,120
I batteries about five and a half hours.
Six hours.

1623
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:44,090
Uh,
it's,

1624
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,030
it's pretty bad ass though.
It just came out.

1625
01:06:46,031 --> 01:06:48,420
It comes out the 22nd.
But you can buy an early version of it.

1626
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:51,220
They send you one early.
I ordered.

1627
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:54,460
They have a early,
like four people that preordered it.

1628
01:06:54,461 --> 01:06:58,410
You can get a weaker noises making 
stupid song the hedgehog.

1629
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:01,650
Now shut that stupid shit off.
Said.

1630
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,670
Oh,
I don't know how to turn it off.

1631
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:04,480
Oh,
that's ridiculous.

1632
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,570
Like there's a lot of stuff.
So.

1633
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:09,220
Cool.
Why would the music be so stupid?

1634
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,090
Oh,
here we go.

1635
01:07:10,091 --> 01:07:13,180
Medical marijuana profit is allowed 
under California law.

1636
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:14,460
should I read it?
Sure.

1637
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,470
Fuck your wife ever eventually when it 
loads up,

1638
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,310
but yeah,
I'm doing a review on it.

1639
01:07:21,311 --> 01:07:24,060
A deaTh squad that was a fun so far.
It's pretty awesome.

1640
01:07:24,061 --> 01:07:29,061
And I like has,
has three g and you don't have any 

1641
01:07:29,061 --> 01:07:29,061
contracts so you can just pay as you go.
Uh,

1642
01:07:29,061 --> 01:07:30,820
the cameras not that good,
but the graphics,

1643
01:07:30,821 --> 01:07:33,130
the screens amazing.
The gains are amazing.

1644
01:07:33,131 --> 01:07:36,580
You could download any,
a lot of the previous console.

1645
01:07:36,581 --> 01:07:39,310
So nowadays are kind of switching to 
where you download your video games.

1646
01:07:39,311 --> 01:07:41,200
IT's still bind to the store.
Oh really?

1647
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,330
Oh that makes sense.
So instead of,

1648
01:07:43,331 --> 01:07:48,331
so instead of getting a district,
you just download it and you just 

1649
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:48,331
download it and then you can delete it 
if you want to,

1650
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:52,680
you can delete it or whatever.
The only negative really going to get 

1651
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:52,680
rid of this.
So you,

1652
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:56,810
that's going to be.
Everything's going to be in a cloud 

1653
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:56,810
downloads I guess.
I like that though.

1654
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:03,840
my learn loan for a quarter phone hEr,
I want to go bad.

1655
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:06,910
I'll do it man.
I don't want everything in the cloUd.

1656
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,350
I do like the cloud.
If they do it right,

1657
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:12,250
like itunes just recently switched over 
to doing it right where it shows you all

1658
01:08:12,251 --> 01:08:15,980
the purchase cd songs that you've ever 
downloaded on itunes and you can

1659
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,120
look it and you could read down to 100 
gigabytes of total songs.

1660
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:27,910
Oh,
are you allowed to talk about what 

1661
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:27,910
happened in Minnesota?
Yeah.

1662
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:30,590
Yeah,
because I only know pieces of this.

1663
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,630
Are you sure?
Because I have to leave out.

1664
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:34,520
Right.
There was a,

1665
01:08:34,521 --> 01:08:37,330
a thing that ari shaffir does.
It's all a lark.

1666
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:42,550
I mean he pretends that what he's doing 
is hiding marijuana all around town and 

1667
01:08:42,771 --> 01:08:47,771
then he calls it a hunt for the edible 
when it's really just lollipops candy.

1668
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,120
Who wouldn't do that to you?
You can't handle it.

1669
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:51,980
It would be.
It would be cute if you can handle it,

1670
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,680
but you can't handle it.
So that said,

1671
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:59,770
but coincidentally I do live in a state 
where they could sell a really small 

1672
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:00,290
stuff all the time.
Right.

1673
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:02,750
But anyone pretty much here,
it's not legal for us here.

1674
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:04,400
Yeah.
So yeah.

1675
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:05,750
So what happened?
So yeah,

1676
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:10,751
I've had them before,
but I had little scavenger hunts for 

1677
01:09:10,751 --> 01:09:12,500
this clearly fake only tobacco product.
I'm noT marijuana.

1678
01:09:12,501 --> 01:09:15,530
Whatever you think it is,
just to see if you got high from it.

1679
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:18,310
Placebo effect.
It's really easy with diabetes.

1680
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:22,070
But man,
I got dizzy.

1681
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:22,700
Yeah,
it's fun.

1682
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:24,980
People just made some clues and people 
just find it.

1683
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,560
And you have been organizing this 
through twitter.

1684
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:33,340
It seems like a solid plan.
Well it's good that you're not using 

1685
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:37,121
real pot because it's totally fucking 
heart attacks and freak the fuck out 

1686
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:39,010
did.
So you did this.

1687
01:09:39,011 --> 01:09:41,900
So usually I do them not in a,
in a specific type of place,

1688
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:44,360
you know,
just do them somewhere like out.

1689
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,370
Right.
I did it this time.

1690
01:09:46,371 --> 01:09:51,050
I tried doing at the mall of America 
don't like fort knox.

1691
01:09:51,051 --> 01:09:52,280
Yeah,
it's all locked down now.

1692
01:09:52,281 --> 01:09:55,060
I guess they have their own security and
they have regular police there too.

1693
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:56,960
And so what happened?
Well,

1694
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:59,330
I uh,
I decided instead of hiding it,

1695
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,940
like in the outside,
like near a pillar or something,

1696
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:07,210
I figured there'd be less cameras.
So I should go into a store and hide 

1697
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:08,370
their increased business for them.
Right.

1698
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,190
And so I did that,
the store grubbY hippies out looking for

1699
01:10:13,191 --> 01:10:14,450
fucking free.
We'd also like,

1700
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:15,600
what kind of clues can I go,
like,

1701
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,270
what's it around that I can think of a 
clue for.

1702
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:23,260
Um,
and then I found a place and then I 

1703
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:26,291
left,
it was like good a building boom that I 

1704
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:26,291
waited for,
like,

1705
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:26,291
you know,
a few hours,

1706
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:28,210
started writing the clues and then I 
started releasing them.

1707
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,760
It was great.
And people that are looking for it first

1708
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:35,770
I narrowed down like a side of the mall,
then like a floor and then like the 

1709
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:37,070
store then like where?
Anyway,

1710
01:10:37,071 --> 01:10:38,270
so the show would just order.

1711
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:41,030
The mc was on.
I was texting outside and um,

1712
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:46,690
and uh,
I just saw a cop to my right to my left 

1713
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:46,690
just standing there and they're like,
alright.

1714
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:47,090
And I was like,
I looked up and I was like,

1715
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:50,540
oh fuck,
this is happening now.

1716
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,450
I really didn't think it would.
Yeah.

1717
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:56,530
And I'm like,
fuck.

1718
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:57,700
They're like,
we're gonna talk to you for.

1719
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:58,430
I'm like,
oh,

1720
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:01,250
hey,
is totally cool,

1721
01:11:01,251 --> 01:11:02,680
but somebodies got to go inside right 
now.

1722
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:07,700
Just let them know that I'm in trouble 
because they're gonna have to find 

1723
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,010
somebody like really soon,
like the show just started like,

1724
01:11:08,011 --> 01:11:11,890
I'm like 40 minutes to find someone to 
live nearby in minneapolis there.

1725
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,070
Just let them know that this is 
happening.

1726
01:11:14,071 --> 01:11:17,100
So they did whatever the cop,
let's just say,

1727
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:19,720
let's just say he was cool.
um,

1728
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,970
so he didn't find any specific evidence.
Um,

1729
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:28,340
so that wasn't a problem,
but the ball security was trying to say 

1730
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:30,711
I couldn't go on,
they're going to ban me from the mall 

1731
01:11:30,711 --> 01:11:30,711
and the club is in the mall.

1732
01:11:30,711 --> 01:11:31,740
Oh yeah.
And then rick brunson,

1733
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:34,560
the owner had to get on the phone and 
start yelling at them saying,

1734
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:39,561
who the fuck are you going to cost me 
money because that idiot fucking hide 

1735
01:11:39,741 --> 01:11:43,260
pot somewhere and hide fake pot.
That's when he called you an idiot.

1736
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:43,860
He said,
yeah,

1737
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:44,970
to the security.
It's like,

1738
01:11:44,971 --> 01:11:49,971
you're not going to cost me a bunch of 
money and refunds and disappoint all 

1739
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:49,971
those people because he wants to be 
fucking moron.

1740
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:50,790
Wow.
I explain that.

1741
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:51,630
What happened to you?
Like what is it?

1742
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:52,380
I'M like,
it's just for fun.

1743
01:11:52,381 --> 01:11:53,430
It's where I'm,
where I go.

1744
01:11:53,431 --> 01:11:58,431
It's totally legal.
It's just I want other people to have 

1745
01:11:58,431 --> 01:11:58,890
fun even though it's fake.
It was fake.

1746
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,210
Fake.
Yes.

1747
01:12:00,211 --> 01:12:01,830
But I think they,
they understood that.

1748
01:12:01,831 --> 01:12:06,831
They're like,
you can't even do that in California 

1749
01:12:06,831 --> 01:12:08,781
because it's only legal with a license 
and you don't have a kid's going to 

1750
01:12:08,781 --> 01:12:08,781
grab.

1751
01:12:08,781 --> 01:12:09,360
It isn't illegal.
That's the thing.

1752
01:12:09,361 --> 01:12:14,361
It's decriminalized in California to a 
certain amount as long as you don't 

1753
01:12:14,361 --> 01:12:14,361
think you're distributing it.
So some people have said,

1754
01:12:14,361 --> 01:12:16,230
what happens to a 15 year old gets it?
I'm like,

1755
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:17,390
yeah,
he gets high.

1756
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:19,590
Great time for them.
What do you mean there's no problem?

1757
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:24,670
They're pretty sure the kid's going to 
have to take these kids who got them 

1758
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:28,800
came the next day to the show did.
Oh,

1759
01:12:28,801 --> 01:12:30,330
well,
lucky it wasn't really we'd.

1760
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,530
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1761
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:33,610
What happened was,
uh,

1762
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:35,850
uh,
the people who went to the underwear,

1763
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,830
I'll have that,
have that store,

1764
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:39,790
but I shouldn't say because that labor 
is pretty cool too.

1765
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:41,710
Um,
uh,

1766
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,520
I'm going to go on a limb and say it was
still say her story.

1767
01:12:44,521 --> 01:12:45,240
She was cool.
She was like,

1768
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:50,510
I'm not going to press charges.
Please take that any mentioned on my 

1769
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:50,510
store so I don't get in trouble.
Okay.

1770
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:52,570
So because it was a male clothing store,
I wanted to hide it,

1771
01:12:52,571 --> 01:12:57,571
a lane bryant at a fabric store,
but I didn't think I'd get in there 

1772
01:12:57,571 --> 01:12:59,100
without being noticed as well.
Like why would it even be in there?

1773
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:01,560
Because you look like something that 
would date a fat person.

1774
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:09,300
Do you really think it looks like 
someone who did some ways if the world 

1775
01:13:09,571 --> 01:13:11,410
gets dark?
Um,

1776
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:12,870
yeah.
So the first one went and got it and the

1777
01:13:12,871 --> 01:13:15,210
underwear and the next principal came in
and they couldn't find it.

1778
01:13:15,211 --> 01:13:17,760
So I start tearing everything up,
like looking for it.

1779
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:21,600
That was an unintended consequence.
That sucks.

1780
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:22,370
Yeah.
But no trouble.

1781
01:13:22,371 --> 01:13:24,090
They let me off like five minutes before
I go on.

1782
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:24,910
Oh,
that's good.

1783
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:27,300
Yeah.
Did you go on stage immediately?

1784
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:29,080
Talk about it?
Of course you did.

1785
01:13:29,081 --> 01:13:31,140
It's the first thing I met with 
everybody.

1786
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:31,860
I'm just,
um,

1787
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,090
I was just a.
Yeah,

1788
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:36,000
and he got on the phone with me.
They were like,

1789
01:13:36,001 --> 01:13:41,001
he wants to talk to you on the phone 
because he was in edmonton on his land 

1790
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:41,001
line and he was like,
hey,

1791
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:42,450
first thing's first,
you need to act like I'm yelling at you.

1792
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:45,030
Okay,
so now is your smile.

1793
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:45,600
Got.
And I was like,

1794
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:46,320
yeah.
And I started laughing.

1795
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:47,220
Don't laugh,
don't laugh.

1796
01:13:47,221 --> 01:13:48,180
I'm serious.
He goes,

1797
01:13:48,181 --> 01:13:49,320
it's not going to be any problem at all.
I'm like,

1798
01:13:49,321 --> 01:13:51,000
sorry dude,
for cutting here because I don't fucking

1799
01:13:51,001 --> 01:13:52,560
care.
It's totally cool.

1800
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,070
I think if you've been running a comedy 
club,

1801
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:57,620
he's also a comic.
No,

1802
01:13:57,950 --> 01:13:58,980
it's totally fine.
Yeah,

1803
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:00,620
you got to be careful.
That's crazy.

1804
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,530
So don't fold.
Repercussions.

1805
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:07,550
Got to be fucking careful.
That shit's superly illegal in certain 

1806
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:09,360
parts of this country and we don't 
realize it because as we sit here,

1807
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:11,770
even though that's another lane once 
doing,

1808
01:14:11,771 --> 01:14:12,080
it's just

1809
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:17,080
so lame.
So you knitting is taking liquid acid 

1810
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:17,080
in.
Squirting it into.

1811
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:23,340
Don't imagine if you did the best that I
was standing there with security and 

1812
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:27,661
some people came up for the late show or
something and they're like already 

1813
01:14:27,661 --> 01:14:27,661
brought something for you and they will 
open up the purse.

1814
01:14:27,661 --> 01:14:27,661
I was like,
no,

1815
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:28,840
no,
no.

1816
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:30,430
But then she was like,
it's okay.

1817
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:32,010
I'm like looking at like,
don't know.

1818
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:37,110
There was a swedish fish.
So those are just some like gumby 

1819
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:37,460
product.
Oh,

1820
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:43,390
that's delicious.
I offered it to the cops and the lady 

1821
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:43,450
cop was super hot.
Really like super high.

1822
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:45,520
How high I was high.
What?

1823
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:48,280
how hot?
Like an la h.

1824
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:48,760
Wow.
Like legit.

1825
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,080
Like I kept looking at her and I was 
like,

1826
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:51,760
you guys should come in and just totally
should come in.

1827
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:53,260
He tried to get her to come to the show.

1828
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,550
I've been trying.
I couldn't go fully.

1829
01:14:54,551 --> 01:14:56,170
Like so when you get off we should hang 
out.

1830
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:57,230
Totally.
Conrad.

1831
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:59,440
I regret not doing it.
She was so pretty.

1832
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:04,420
It was a little worried.
Maybe she's starving.

1833
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,150
Intellectual conversatIon.
A funny guy.

1834
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,390
Great sense of humor.
She seemed like she got it too.

1835
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:15,440
Try to keep the handle or maybe she was 
dating the other really nice cop guide 

1836
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:15,860
and thrown you and praising you.
Probably.

1837
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:17,380
Fuck.
So every time they shoot somebody,

1838
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:21,640
that's the deal.
Don't shoot people down then.

1839
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:23,080
Dude,
shit gets crazy.

1840
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:25,860
Do you remember the mall cop?
she wasn't even a real.

1841
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:27,670
It wasn't a real tough.
She was part of the mall cop.

1842
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,640
She was so pretty man.
I was like,

1843
01:15:30,641 --> 01:15:32,860
you guys should have a comment.
We should responsive at all to you.

1844
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:37,861
She would smile.
She knew that it was just something 

1845
01:15:37,861 --> 01:15:37,861
being an idiot.

1846
01:15:37,861 --> 01:15:41,100
The guy mall cop was trying to pretend 
like it was a bad ass,

1847
01:15:41,101 --> 01:15:42,520
but he couldn't really keep it going 
that much.

1848
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,520
Head of security was trying to really 
enforce the law,

1849
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:51,100
but who fucking cares?
You get in trouble,

1850
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:53,020
but I could've.
Could've wenT to jail.

1851
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:55,210
You know what,
if somebody just showed up the joint,

1852
01:15:55,211 --> 01:15:59,260
so this dirty jew gave me this joint.
I can say that now and I smoked it.

1853
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,620
Whoa.
Don't stop doing that.

1854
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,320
We're going to have be real from cypress
hill on soon.

1855
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:06,070
Oh,
that's cool.

1856
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:08,950
I've been going back and forth with them
on twitter and arch barker.

1857
01:16:08,951 --> 01:16:11,350
He's going to be on to one of the things
about.

1858
01:16:11,351 --> 01:16:12,370
Yeah,
he's in America to monday.

1859
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:17,610
One of the things about a be real from 
cypress hill that he and I shared that 

1860
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:17,610
he won't just take weed from strangers.
He won't.

1861
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:20,680
He won't feel it there.
We'd benefit from everybody.

1862
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:22,360
Yeah.
Doug benson does.

1863
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:27,361
He gets involved but the government is 
probably getting high with them too and 

1864
01:16:27,361 --> 01:16:30,661
they're probably some some ways we just 
got like little gps signals in that.

1865
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:32,920
That's all you get high off at this 
point.

1866
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:36,980
Tolerance too high off gps.
Gps crystals.

1867
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:40,390
Getting high off wifi.
Didn't be hard.

1868
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:47,440
How about how long before they actually 
just spray you with some shit they can 

1869
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:47,740
track you with?
Probably pretty.

1870
01:16:47,741 --> 01:16:52,741
Probably already have the capabilities.
We already have the idea that they can 

1871
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:52,741
track it already.
Yeah,

1872
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:54,820
I mean it's hard to find you just 
through your role on the grid.

1873
01:16:54,821 --> 01:16:55,540
Yeah.
Twitter,

1874
01:16:55,541 --> 01:17:00,541
you're going to go going to burbank 
about the airport should go about your 

1875
01:17:00,541 --> 01:17:04,651
business.
They don't care what you do most of the 

1876
01:17:04,651 --> 01:17:04,651
time.
Most of the time until you oppose them,

1877
01:17:04,651 --> 01:17:07,690
until you're ready to take over.
Can you imagine the kind of taPping they

1878
01:17:07,691 --> 01:17:09,950
have on ron paul's information?
He

1879
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,340
can't even order a pizza without them 
breaking down the word.

1880
01:17:12,341 --> 01:17:16,500
And hoW long is the aardvark bar going 
to be here for him?

1881
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,320
He said til monday.
okay.

1882
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:23,790
Amazing.
So ignoring this ron paul cat and then 

1883
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:24,560
pushing this rick santorum,
dude on everybody.

1884
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:25,790
Well,
at least it's not a mormon.

1885
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,470
There's been evidence of voter fraud in 
main.

1886
01:17:27,471 --> 01:17:32,471
By the way,
ron paul supposed to the one in Maine 

1887
01:17:32,471 --> 01:17:35,441
and they were uh,
before even all the precincts were 

1888
01:17:35,441 --> 01:17:35,441
counted,
they were giving it to santorum.

1889
01:17:35,441 --> 01:17:36,590
They're saying is voter fraud and made 
really.

1890
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,000
I mean it's just a have to do.
I'm paula when,

1891
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:41,480
once the prelims.
Well,

1892
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:43,700
you know what man,
I think this whole system is rigged.

1893
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:45,980
Of course it is really,
absolutely,

1894
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,540
absolutely.
Truly believe it.

1895
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:52,541
And I think these guys are just 
auditioning to be the ceo of a company 

1896
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:56,531
or they're not even going to get a 
chance to say what the fuck gets to go 

1897
01:17:56,531 --> 01:17:56,531
on and they're not going to get it 
anyway.

1898
01:17:56,531 --> 01:17:59,450
Obama's gonna win again.
A ball was way better than mitt romney.

1899
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,270
He's way more charismatic.
He can look,

1900
01:18:02,271 --> 01:18:07,271
they can do some hollywood math and the 
numbers and have you convinced that 

1901
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:08,500
we're in an epipen economic,
that he to the rich.

1902
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:13,540
Yeah.
He came in the wrong time and the world 

1903
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:14,120
that the world was fucked up when he got
here and the country was fucked up,

1904
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:19,300
but in the time that he's been here held
spins and puking the legislation that 

1905
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,330
we've passed and help this and the 
economic stimulus and a.

1906
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:26,300
The things sort of whatever that 
national defense authorization act kills

1907
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,190
everything that he did.
Everything.

1908
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:33,670
That's that thing that allows people to 
be detained indefinitely with no 

1909
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:37,671
warrants.
The fact that he passed that like it's 

1910
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:38,240
just such an easy way to abuse the so 
gross.

1911
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:43,600
It's gross.
It's consistently on my radio station 

1912
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:43,600
that comes on like the news about the.

1913
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,830
About the,
about the elections have predilections 

1914
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:50,620
wherever they're happening.
It just seems like when newt gingrich 

1915
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:50,810
and perry and santorum and all the other
mitt romney,

1916
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:54,870
it seems like to keep like just lying 
and then like going back on.

1917
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:55,640
Yeah,
I did say this,

1918
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:58,740
but that's not what I believe now.
It just seems like a little kids thing.

1919
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,360
Whatever they can so they can get their 
prize,

1920
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,520
but it's like enron,
paul's and just as well,

1921
01:19:04,521 --> 01:19:06,110
this is what I believe.
A lot of this shit's not popular.

1922
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:07,190
Give me another one of those.
Good,

1923
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:13,540
but it's like,
this is what I've always said the same 

1924
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:13,540
thing for always.
Yeah.

1925
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:14,300
When they're afraid of going on the 
record for what they really believe.

1926
01:19:14,301 --> 01:19:16,010
If it's not popular,
it's real.

1927
01:19:16,011 --> 01:19:17,450
They don't believe shit.
They just leave.

1928
01:19:17,451 --> 01:19:20,360
They want to be president.
Like they're just trying to get elected.

1929
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,390
It's like when you auditioned for a show
that you hope you don't get.

1930
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:23,870
Yeah.
We're like,

1931
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:25,300
this sucks,
but like I'll put.

1932
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:28,640
I'll make believe humor.
Rick perry is so lucky.

1933
01:19:28,641 --> 01:19:33,641
He's dumb because now he gets to live 
the rest of his life without secret 

1934
01:19:33,641 --> 01:19:33,830
service agents wiping his ass everywhere
he goes,

1935
01:19:33,831 --> 01:19:36,260
because if he won and he could have 
fucking one,

1936
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:41,290
don't get me wrong if that guy.
I auditioned for the role of president 

1937
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:41,360
just four years ago.
Okay.

1938
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:46,361
And he was just coached a little bit 
better and some more little hindsight 

1939
01:19:46,361 --> 01:19:46,361
prepared some.
Yeah.

1940
01:19:46,361 --> 01:19:50,951
You get some smart dudes behind him.
It is attracting the best pr people.

1941
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,530
He's no dumber than earlier.
He's no dumber than gw.

1942
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:56,990
It's just like an actress just to build 
your resume,

1943
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:58,900
build your resume,
do it correctly.

1944
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,740
Unpopular at the right time.
Exactly.

1945
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:03,080
He was popular one point in time.
Do you remember?

1946
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,780
It was like that guy was like,
he lOoked handsome,

1947
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:08,310
looked lIke fucking,
but I rather than talking about obama

1948
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,620
at some like democratic convention and 
they're like,

1949
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:11,760
oh,
he gave a really good speech.

1950
01:20:11,761 --> 01:20:12,600
People are gonna.
Look at him noW.

1951
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:17,601
It's like a presidential guy.
It's like having a really good game and 

1952
01:20:17,601 --> 01:20:18,210
the nba all star game.
it's like having a good set on,

1953
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,920
on comedy central and all of a sudden 
it's like,

1954
01:20:19,921 --> 01:20:20,670
oh,
watch out.

1955
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,360
YeAh,
it's an awesome chick.

1956
01:20:22,361 --> 01:20:23,670
It's a movie.
Yeah.

1957
01:20:23,671 --> 01:20:24,710
I remember my,
um,

1958
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:28,140
my friend who I will not name his name 
because he's a silly,

1959
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:33,230
silly fucking liberal.
Not there's anything wrong with being a 

1960
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:33,230
liberal,
but he's silly.

1961
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:34,920
He's just one of those guys and when I,
they believe it too much.

1962
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:36,630
I am very liberal and most of the 
things,

1963
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:39,480
most things I can't marriage and civil 
rights and most of those things.

1964
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:44,900
But um,
shouldn't be attached to everything 

1965
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:44,900
though.
Exactly.

1966
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:44,900
I'm not on a team.

1967
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:44,970
I'm not on team.
This team that.

1968
01:20:44,971 --> 01:20:47,880
And when you are,
I think you're silly if you're a liberal

1969
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:48,970
by choice,
you know,

1970
01:20:48,971 --> 01:20:49,470
like,
you know,

1971
01:20:49,471 --> 01:20:53,760
in a category predetermined pattern 
behavior your fall or your conservative,

1972
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:58,790
either one of them is just silly to me.
But this guy was like telling me like 

1973
01:20:58,790 --> 01:20:59,730
what a great president obama would make.
And I go,

1974
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:02,100
why do you say that?
What policies that he supports,

1975
01:21:02,101 --> 01:21:05,250
do you,
do you believe he didn't have a fucking.

1976
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:10,580
Nothing to say.
He just started giving me like 

1977
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:10,580
doubletalk.
I go,

1978
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:13,401
do you eveN know this?
Anything that stuff this guy does or do 

1979
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:13,760
you love him because he's a good looking
black guy and know the love,

1980
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:15,480
lIke supporting a black guy because 
you're.

1981
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:20,510
You got a little bit of white guilt and 
he didn't want to administer howard 

1982
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:23,990
stern thing they did where they 
interview people and just messed up the 

1983
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:23,990
facts like obama,
obama,

1984
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:25,630
mccain is running together against 
someone.

1985
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:27,750
Who are you going to vote for obama or 
mccain?

1986
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:29,040
Oh no,
I'm okay.

1987
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:31,020
Do you think would be a good buy present
for obama was like,

1988
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:32,880
yeah,
I like his policies.

1989
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,010
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1990
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,370
Yeah.
Was it,

1991
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:40,400
was it.
I'm trying to remember who that fuck 

1992
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:40,590
that was good at.
Maybe it's a tough crowd.

1993
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:42,360
Fuck,
I wish I knew what it was.

1994
01:21:42,361 --> 01:21:43,120
It was.
Who's that guy?

1995
01:21:43,121 --> 01:21:48,121
We met him in New York that time.
The boston common boston comic.

1996
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:49,860
I'm like me.
I was telling nick depaulo.

1997
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:53,070
Yeah.
I think what I was texting or something.

1998
01:21:53,071 --> 01:21:53,640
No,
no,

1999
01:21:53,641 --> 01:21:57,120
that's not what it was you.
You joked around about jocks.

2000
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,970
He said something about john boston is 
all jocks.

2001
01:21:59,971 --> 01:22:00,960
That's good.
Yeah.

2002
01:22:00,961 --> 01:22:05,961
That's what you said.
A bunch of dumb jocks fuckers just 

2003
01:22:05,961 --> 01:22:08,960
cracked.
Nick dipaolo is quick to tell you the 

2004
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:09,480
word sweater or something and I was 
like,

2005
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:10,400
oh,
well kids,

2006
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:11,970
we all kept below.

2007
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:15,160
What do you think?
what the venture?

2008
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:15,780
Yeah.
He thought,

2009
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:20,960
well,
you kind of dress a little bit like a 

2010
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:20,960
hipsteR.
Yeah,

2011
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:20,960
I guess they do and people that didn't 
know you,

2012
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,680
they would totally think you're a 
hipster until you hear you talk.

2013
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:25,920
Anything alternative comic,
a filthy dirty mouth on stage.

2014
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,840
Yeah.
they would take your alternative.

2015
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:33,260
Thank god you're not just so hard to be 
friends with an alternative comment.

2016
01:22:33,261 --> 01:22:34,740
I can pretend that all that shit is 
funny.

2017
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,240
It's starting to go away.
The lines,

2018
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:41,300
of course it is some real good people 
that just go up in that scene and then 

2019
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:41,300
vice versa.
It just comics.

2020
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:46,310
yeah,
of course it is the the people that 

2021
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:46,310
wanted to be alternative.
They literally used to always do that.

2022
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:50,990
Yeah,
but they all rooms and he goes to the 

2023
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:50,990
store and you're like,
oh,

2024
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:50,990
you come here to him.

2025
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:51,540
It's like,
what do you mean six times?

2026
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,980
Yeah.
He's just a comic.

2027
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,200
Yeah,
he's smart enough to realize that,

2028
01:22:55,201 --> 01:22:56,620
but a lot of these dummies,
they.

2029
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:57,630
It was like,
you know what?

2030
01:22:57,660 --> 01:22:59,280
It was like,
we found a cool club.

2031
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:03,060
This is like the cool kids club is the 
janeane garofalo club.

2032
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:05,970
Chechen rebel.
Doesn't that sound like a serial church?

2033
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,070
Me?
Yeah.

2034
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:09,220
Yeah.
What would you say that?

2035
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:14,340
Because that's really low line because 
he was looking.

2036
01:23:14,351 --> 01:23:19,351
I think he was imagining her doing.
I'm doing what they do on stage and sang

2037
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:23,470
something mildly ironic.
You know?

2038
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:26,960
It's not even funny.
Shot at not funny.

2039
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,650
No.
Work harder.

2040
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:31,710
You're not trying hard enough.
Then you,

2041
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:34,690
your point of view sucks because it's 
not real.

2042
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,960
You're not really.
You're just trying to fit into a mold 

2043
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:39,960
that you think these little hipster twat
heads are gonna.

2044
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:40,960
Appreciate.
Clap,

2045
01:23:40,961 --> 01:23:41,440
clap.

2046
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:46,680
I saw paul,
tom because talking about the state of 

2047
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:46,680
alternative comedy podcasts in san 
francisco,

2048
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:46,920
jamie kilstein,
his estate,

2049
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:48,040
his aides.
He goes,

2050
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:53,041
it's really sucky right now.
He's always people trying to Be 

2051
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:55,621
alternative comics and sucky because 
they're trying to be this instead of 

2052
01:23:55,621 --> 01:23:55,660
just being.
It's aids,

2053
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:57,190
aids,
aids.

2054
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:00,490
It's not funny and they're super snotty 
about it.

2055
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:02,490
It's like the thing about the grossest 
thing,

2056
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,170
snotty,
snotty nose,

2057
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:10,870
overwatch,
it's you're not even putting out good 

2058
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:10,870
art,
like shut your mouth.

2059
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:11,830
It's not good stuff.
It's not funny.

2060
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,200
You know the.
The bottom line is it was created.

2061
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:15,300
Some of it is.
Yeah,

2062
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,360
but that's good comedy period.
Good.

2063
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:22,470
Anywhere there.
The bottom line is the need for 

2064
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:25,501
alternative comedy was created because 
the ones who were trying to do it 

2065
01:24:25,501 --> 01:24:27,130
weren't successful in other rooms.
They weren't successful.

2066
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:32,370
Whether it's because they're performing 
for dme crowns or whether it's 

2067
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:32,380
performing for people that didn't 
appreciate what they were doing,

2068
01:24:32,381 --> 01:24:33,670
so they had to find people who did.

2069
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:37,570
That's all well and good,
but they became an a lot of ways.

2070
01:24:37,571 --> 01:24:42,571
Not all of them.
Totally generalizing and pigeon holing 

2071
01:24:42,571 --> 01:24:42,640
irony,
this ironic disposition.

2072
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:47,080
They also became like sort of comedy 
bullies to,

2073
01:24:47,081 --> 01:24:52,081
you know,
like if you hung around them like bert 

2074
01:24:52,081 --> 01:24:53,470
kreischer is a terrible story about them
being fucking shitty to him over the uc,

2075
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:58,500
whatever it is.
Do you see being about how gross was 

2076
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:58,500
experienced?
Was there.

2077
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,520
Because when people are bullied,
they want to bully back,

2078
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:05,910
you know,
children that are molested go onto 

2079
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:05,910
become a lester's.
So weird.

2080
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:09,511
But then ian edwards,
I've met him in like my mobile 

2081
01:25:09,511 --> 01:25:09,640
connection.
I did call me on it,

2082
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,470
like whatever.
Just keep talking stupid,

2083
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,130
keep rambling and go with an 
alternative.

2084
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:16,260
I'm like,
what material do for this?

2085
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:17,590
It goes crowds and crowds,
man.

2086
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:20,860
yeah,
I've done it twice and had great crowds.

2087
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:21,880
Yeah,
I did the ucb.

2088
01:25:21,881 --> 01:25:23,410
I loved it.
I had a great time now,

2089
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:28,000
but the audiences,
it's a comic artists and it's not all of

2090
01:25:28,001 --> 01:25:28,870
them.
It's just a few of them.

2091
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,500
It's just like cops,
a few cuts spoil the whole pockets.

2092
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:32,530
What it is,
that's what it is,

2093
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,670
what it is.
Exactly what it is.

2094
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:35,650
That's why everyone's against them.
Because those few cons.

2095
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:36,900
Yeah,
and same with cops.

2096
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:38,580
Same with girls.
You know,

2097
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:40,150
same with guys,
you know,

2098
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,030
same with everything.
The few people on this,

2099
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,220
I don't think congress anymore because 
all the comments that have been bad.

2100
01:25:45,221 --> 01:25:45,820
I'm like,
come on,

2101
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:50,821
wait,
break it down because I'm not all of 

2102
01:25:50,821 --> 01:25:50,821
them.
Yeah,

2103
01:25:50,821 --> 01:25:50,821
but you're terrible.
Yeah.

2104
01:25:50,821 --> 01:25:52,570
But if it's like all about like whatever
it is,

2105
01:25:52,571 --> 01:25:52,900
I'm like,
yeah,

2106
01:25:52,901 --> 01:25:53,570
yeah,
we did that.

2107
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:58,770
Just like I'm gonna give you a chance.
But if they say they're needy,

2108
01:25:59,591 --> 01:26:00,910
then I'm like,
well I'm not needy,

2109
01:26:00,911 --> 01:26:02,340
but I like the kick mit.
I'm like,

2110
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:03,070
oh yeah.
Right.

2111
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:03,590
That's fine.
Yeah,

2112
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:04,000
we shouldn't do

2113
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:04,850
it.
Yeah.

2114
01:26:04,851 --> 01:26:09,851
Well isn't that what all women want?
Arash fear that some of them down one 

2115
01:26:09,851 --> 01:26:13,780
love,
they'll want to know that you're going 

2116
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:13,780
to be there for them.
They all want you to listen to their,

2117
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:17,080
their highlight reel,
highlight reel director act worse,

2118
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:20,480
dating a comic dating comic and you have
to help them with their act.

2119
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:25,510
Do you think this is funny?
There's nothing more of a turn off the 

2120
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:28,580
grill going over her bits with you.
Anyone going over the bits with 

2121
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:28,580
horrible.
Yeah,

2122
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:29,480
but a girl that you want to fuck and 
she.

2123
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:29,990
Okay.
Okay.

2124
01:26:29,991 --> 01:26:31,010
Stop it.
Stop it.

2125
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:31,780
Stop it.
I want.

2126
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:33,890
I want you to listen to my.
Listen to my child.

2127
01:26:34,330 --> 01:26:35,240
Tell me things.
It's funny.

2128
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:39,320
I mean dick is like a headache and your 
pants don't,

2129
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,340
don't,
don't,

2130
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,650
don't.
Let's just do it.

2131
01:26:42,651 --> 01:26:44,630
And they just want tell me,
tell me the things.

2132
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:46,640
This is good.
I've dated a few callbacks.

2133
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:51,880
I started telling him now it's like,
I am not going to help you with your 

2134
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:51,880
act.
I'm not going to try to correct you.

2135
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,960
If I see something like thematically 
you're doing that,

2136
01:26:53,961 --> 01:26:56,120
I can see a fixed for like you should 
check out this room.

2137
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:58,550
Might do.
Well they're like,

2138
01:26:58,551 --> 01:26:59,930
I will do that,
but that's it.

2139
01:26:59,931 --> 01:27:02,090
Let's just give you suggestions of like 
directions to go.

2140
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,940
Yeah.
I go to peers.

2141
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:06,990
There is something wrong with this bit 
man who's going to bid?

2142
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:09,200
Feeding scene too verbose or something 
like that.

2143
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,290
I kind of just sounding off.
I kind of know anyway.

2144
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,210
If you're being objective about your 
shit,

2145
01:27:14,211 --> 01:27:16,190
which always has.
Somebody tells you they saw that.

2146
01:27:16,191 --> 01:27:16,940
Like,
I liked that joke.

2147
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:17,470
I'm like,
do you think?

2148
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:18,890
Yeah,
it's actually take it in there.

2149
01:27:18,891 --> 01:27:21,500
It needs a little some or you know,
they saw it.

2150
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:23,600
You kind of know though,
you know,

2151
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:25,910
when something needs something,
if you're being really honest about it.

2152
01:27:25,911 --> 01:27:27,350
Right.
But sometimes they help you.

2153
01:27:27,351 --> 01:27:27,680
They're like,
well,

2154
01:27:27,681 --> 01:27:29,390
have you ever thought about going from 
there into your,

2155
01:27:29,391 --> 01:27:30,620
like your family right there and you're 
like,

2156
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:33,080
oh,
I didn't know you were reading comics.

2157
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:35,180
They're not writing you a joke.
They're just like an angle.

2158
01:27:35,181 --> 01:27:36,050
You didn't.
Yeah,

2159
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:38,510
yeah.
Or good taglines or yeah.

2160
01:27:38,511 --> 01:27:42,830
I had this king kong bit that I was 
doing and a louis ck pulled me aside.

2161
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:43,700
He goes,
you know,

2162
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:45,530
it was really funny.
You should say that.

2163
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:49,110
Cognizance really wife too.
And like do this thing.

2164
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:54,420
Look king kong's d wife at home.
Why this whole thing about king kong 

2165
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:58,961
being like the most racist movie ever?
You kNow that he was around these naked 

2166
01:27:58,961 --> 01:28:00,950
black women his entire life.
He never gave a fuck.

2167
01:28:00,951 --> 01:28:04,580
He saw one white chick and address and 
lost his fucking mind.

2168
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,260
It had to have her,
you know,

2169
01:28:06,261 --> 01:28:08,830
mean really exactly what that movie was.
They were dancing.

2170
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,510
these black girls,
they had feathers on shit.

2171
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,620
They were taking their tits,
hanging out,

2172
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:15,140
drums,
playing fire dance and shit.

2173
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:16,580
No one cared and he's like,
hey,

2174
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:21,600
should I can congress and wife?
That was why he was still married 

2175
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:21,710
though.

2176
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:28,850
That's lIke the angle you always go to 
see what holds them back.

2177
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,900
it keeps them from being funny comic 
again.

2178
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:37,400
A casually.
They told me that sometimes.

2179
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,780
I think that again today,
yesterday.

2180
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:42,490
Do you really stinking.
Oh my gosh.

2181
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:48,460
Natasha again.
Damn heavy.

2182
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:54,800
So weird.
Did you even fucking imagine you guys 

2183
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,030
just swapped back and forth and you're 
like,

2184
01:28:56,031 --> 01:28:57,170
look,
I know you left me before.

2185
01:28:57,171 --> 01:28:58,610
But uh,
I wasn't a man that I am now.

2186
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,410
I'm a different man now.
I'm a different man now.

2187
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,070
I think it was totally

2188
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,170
cool.
Was totally cold back then when you went

2189
01:29:04,171 --> 01:29:07,410
with duncan,
you just go right to me.

2190
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:12,120
One second you blog and then as soon as 
you pull out,

2191
01:29:12,121 --> 01:29:15,570
you net it right in her eyes and say,
fuck you.

2192
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:18,240
I've been waiting for five years to do 
this.

2193
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:23,630
Fuck you.
And give her a double fingers while 

2194
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:25,380
you're naked.
Fuck how many guys had done that,

2195
01:29:25,381 --> 01:29:27,110
got back with a girl.
Pretend to be in love with that,

2196
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:28,580
just so they could shoot a little bit.
I can do that.

2197
01:29:28,710 --> 01:29:30,570
And then just just say,
fuck.

2198
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:33,270
You ever see that old movIe called the 
the,

2199
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:38,970
the era.
It's about this girl who got jilted and 

2200
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:38,970
she goes,
well boy,

2201
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:40,890
it's to get revenge for like decades.
That's like I spit on your grave.

2202
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:46,290
Yeah.
I have grossed out that weight on like 

2203
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:47,680
just to box and lindsey low and I think 
in like 12 years.

2204
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:49,740
And they would probably be doable once 
they hit the wall.

2205
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:53,230
You know who I think you can get you.
Brett butler from grace under fire.

2206
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:57,910
A place to stay right there.
You can take my face bright.

2207
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:02,920
But she talked about her and back on the
last show about how crazy it was that 

2208
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,400
she was one of the chuck lorre.
She was a chuck lorre show.

2209
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:08,310
Grace under fire.
That guy has just been around forever.

2210
01:30:08,311 --> 01:30:09,690
Just turn them out,
the hIts.

2211
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:10,610
And she,
uh,

2212
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:14,100
she was all cracked out and she said 
there was always the,

2213
01:30:14,101 --> 01:30:19,101
um,
the rumor on the success that she had 

2214
01:30:19,101 --> 01:30:19,380
done some crazy thing,
threw a drink in his face and he got,

2215
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:20,660
she got gone from that.
Yeah.

2216
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:26,040
Powerful is,
fuck you think he cares that you're 

2217
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:26,040
ready to twelfth.
Uh,

2218
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,390
you're not supposed to do that.
A lot of money.

2219
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:28,860
You're not supposed to do that.
Anyway,

2220
01:30:28,861 --> 01:30:31,440
that's what killed titus is show to ever
turn something down for money.

2221
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:33,300
Like somebody offers a spot to this and 
you're like,

2222
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:35,370
that doesn't go with what I do at all.
Oh yeah,

2223
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,170
definitely.
It's like people can turn down money.

2224
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,360
Chuck lorre says I don't need,
I have plenty of money.

2225
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:44,400
You just can't.
I'll just not do your show or kill your 

2226
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:44,400
show before it goes to cindy.
You're going to be a complete asshole to

2227
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:49,371
me than you know.
I'm not going to work for you if it 

2228
01:30:49,371 --> 01:30:49,371
kills you.
that tituss show.

2229
01:30:49,371 --> 01:30:49,371
But fairly syndication.
Yeah.

2230
01:30:49,371 --> 01:30:52,030
He had some crazy blowout.
Maybe that tv show.

2231
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,470
I talked about it a few times,
but no one could remember it.

2232
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:55,980
It's called Mr.
Smith.

2233
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:57,780
It was about a monkey monkey.
Vice president.

2234
01:30:57,860 --> 01:30:58,290
Yeah,
yeah,

2235
01:30:58,291 --> 01:30:59,980
yeah.
And it's in black and white.

2236
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:00,540
No,
no,

2237
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:00,750
no.

2238
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:02,510
That's your thing that Mr.
Smith goes to Washington.

2239
01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:07,530
Well this is a tv show aNd somebody 
uploaded a,

2240
01:31:07,531 --> 01:31:12,531
like five second commercial on youtube 
the other day and so I finally sent me.

2241
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:16,110
So I find.
So I finally found a.

2242
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:19,230
I have a screenshot of that monkey,
so I don't know if I'm going crazy.

2243
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:21,650
That's an orangutan.
They hang a tank guy.

2244
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,610
This is what it looked like.
He,

2245
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,000
he was the president and it was some 
kind of animated or a muppet realistic 

2246
01:31:29,641 --> 01:31:31,950
muppet type alf type thing.
Oh.

2247
01:31:31,951 --> 01:31:35,370
So it Was a.
Wasn't there wasn't a real.

2248
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:38,550
Do they use both?
it sounds like when nbc went to 7:30

2249
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,280
prime time,
small,

2250
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:44,790
small wonder I think was there was nbc 
also my two dads.

2251
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:45,600
IT was nbc.
Yeah.

2252
01:31:45,601 --> 01:31:48,030
It seemed like.
And they're all way worse than a regular

2253
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:49,730
sitcoms.
Sitcoms.

2254
01:31:49,731 --> 01:31:50,770
A shitty.
Think what?

2255
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:55,820
Wouldn't have made it right here.
I want to read this about the cannabis 

2256
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:55,820
thing.
Okay.

2257
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:57,270
Okay.
There's the robert raich who wrote it.

2258
01:31:57,490 --> 01:32:00,100
There's a widely held misconception that
businesses in California medical

2259
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,410
cannabis industry are prohibited from 
making a profit.

2260
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:07,920
In realiTy,
no California law prohibits cannabis 

2261
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,580
related businessman for making a profit.
Opponents of metal pot.

2262
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,650
I'm going to translate as I read it.
However,

2263
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:14,980
I've done a masterful job spreading 
disinformation since sb four.

2264
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
20 was signed into law in 2003.
The disinformation has become so 

2265
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,460
prevalent that is affecting safe access 
to medical cannabis patients,

2266
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:22,450
blah,
blah,

2267
01:32:22,451 --> 01:32:24,430
blah.
Okay,

2268
01:32:24,431 --> 01:32:26,650
and is it resulted in state senator 
john,

2269
01:32:26,651 --> 01:32:29,120
whatever releasing a letter debunking 
the why,

2270
01:32:29,121 --> 01:32:30,970
the health medical reception,
that part,

2271
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,030
that profit is not permitted for medical
cannabis providers under California law.

2272
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,070
Looking at brian's moth,
the giant moth,

2273
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:40,630
he smoked and just moved.
It's shit.

2274
01:32:40,670 --> 01:32:45,670
Why would you smoke?
Something that came out of that liquid 

2275
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:47,000
looks so trippy that I'm like,
I wonder if this would do anything.

2276
01:32:47,970 --> 01:32:50,690
I mean,
it didn't look like a fucking poison.

2277
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:54,170
It was probably poop or something.
It's probably lit it anyway.

2278
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:55,610
Poison.
It's probably it.

2279
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:00,680
You know what it is?
It probably had had a miscarriage right 

2280
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:00,680
there oN your floor.
Yeah,

2281
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:02,090
I bet it was pregnant.
I bet that was pregnant.

2282
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,880
Could be because they might look like to
for two days.

2283
01:33:04,881 --> 01:33:06,260
Yeah.
Jesus christ.

2284
01:33:06,261 --> 01:33:08,180
Brian,
you got to die.

2285
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:11,180
It's not good.
Whatever it is is not good.

2286
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:12,700
You have like one of those ports on 
trees where,

2287
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:15,050
where it goes over,
we can stay in the room if you won't get

2288
01:33:15,051 --> 01:33:16,040
what?
Yeah.

2289
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:18,630
What did mouth love that?
Here?

2290
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:20,640
It's finally talking today.
Bob.

2291
01:33:22,230 --> 01:33:24,310
Was both of those just downloading it 
this way?

2292
01:33:24,370 --> 01:33:25,560
Are those your balls?
Huh?

2293
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:26,730
Oh,
there's your balls.

2294
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:28,880
No,
they're pretty.

2295
01:33:28,881 --> 01:33:33,881
If they are,
can you imagine if you got an operation 

2296
01:33:33,881 --> 01:33:33,881
to have your balls always in the shape 
of a heart.

2297
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:37,310
It was a new thing and women wanted you 
to do it.

2298
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:42,430
I show them that you really cared and 
yOu just get your balls tucked into a 

2299
01:33:42,430 --> 01:33:42,770
heart shape.
Like they would.

2300
01:33:42,771 --> 01:33:47,771
Uh,
there was like a little plastic v 

2301
01:33:47,771 --> 01:33:49,850
implant that they would put in at the 
bottom of my heart.

2302
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,370
I always wanted to do it.
I always want to wonder why,

2303
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:57,400
like belly buttons never got like,
like getting an extended or Changed in 

2304
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,940
any way.
The balls are so vulnerable,

2305
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,750
but nobody would touch it.
Sometimes they get bothered.

2306
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:01,700
Button rings,
people,

2307
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:04,400
girls get an implant on your balls with 
like a wireframe.

2308
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:05,930
That was like in the shape of a heart.

2309
01:34:06,170 --> 01:34:09,620
Like those ladies dresses from the old 
days,

2310
01:34:09,621 --> 01:34:10,620
but I had to pool from out.
Yeah,

2311
01:34:10,630 --> 01:34:15,630
they're just spread it Out like a bat.
The bat wing over the balls and spread 

2312
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:17,690
it out into your fucking balls are 
already super vulnerable.

2313
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:22,740
If somebody kicks you in the balls and 
you have an implant in their skin was 

2314
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:26,420
even hurt anymore,
but there's so much extra skin you can 

2315
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:27,080
do stuff with them so much.
Totally.

2316
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:27,980
Well,
that's what we were talking about.

2317
01:34:27,981 --> 01:34:29,570
The guy who got fucked to death by the 
horse.

2318
01:34:29,571 --> 01:34:33,440
He had like a whole binder.
A notebook binder.

2319
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:34,730
Yeah,
of of rings.

2320
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:36,830
Why not?
Of course it eventually will do that.

2321
01:34:36,831 --> 01:34:38,030
People will put it in the shape of a 
heart.

2322
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:40,580
That'd be sweet.
It'll be a cupcake maker.

2323
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:42,960
Get girls to suck on them.
Swear you.

2324
01:34:42,961 --> 01:34:45,480
You'd keep your hard drive ways.
No,

2325
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,390
that's not true.
Take your dick out.

2326
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:49,300
Suck on your balls will suck on your 
balls,

2327
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:50,870
period.
The odds of it happening.

2328
01:34:50,871 --> 01:34:52,580
Yeah.
If a girl won't Suck on your balls,

2329
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:55,100
you really shouldn't be with her.
I don't like it.

2330
01:34:55,101 --> 01:34:56,980
I think it tickles.
You got problems you,

2331
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:58,070
it doesn't take

2332
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:01,100
all you at all.
If a girl will suck on your balls.

2333
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:04,040
Oh my girlfriend loves it.
That's basically polly's move.

2334
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:05,480
He would take it out.
She'll do anything.

2335
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,790
Just take it out just as.
Yeah.

2336
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:14,960
And it would say like,
either they're going to do this or 

2337
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:14,960
they're not.
WE're going to find out right now.

2338
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:14,960
Yeah.
But I mean,

2339
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:14,960
girl,
you're dating.

2340
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,010
Oh,
you didn't suck your balls.

2341
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:18,710
Some girls won't suck balls.
They'll suck your dick.

2342
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:24,080
But there's a line they won't cross.
There's girls that you can't come in 

2343
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:24,080
their mouth.
That's what she wants.

2344
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:28,100
A alley was walking by and um,
and uh,

2345
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,650
we were pretending.
I just had my balls out all the time,

2346
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:32,120
right at the store.
Just all the time.

2347
01:35:32,121 --> 01:35:34,270
Just had my dick and balls out and we're
trying to get at the.

2348
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:36,410
Commits this one girl to like,
no,

2349
01:35:36,411 --> 01:35:36,980
it's totally normal.

2350
01:35:36,990 --> 01:35:38,840
They smell fine,
you should just suck it.

2351
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,810
Oh,
I remember this day and pretended like,

2352
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:42,730
oh really?
Yeah.

2353
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:44,630
I said like she didn't know me and she 
was like,

2354
01:35:44,631 --> 01:35:45,440
hey,
what's going on?

2355
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:46,330
Uh,
there's like,

2356
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:47,900
do you know this guy is like,
know what's happening.

2357
01:35:47,901 --> 01:35:49,280
I love the comedy store.
It's so fun here.

2358
01:35:50,170 --> 01:35:55,170
They were like,
we're trying to explain like it's 

2359
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:55,170
totally cool.
Just these guys.

2360
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:55,170
They're like,
oh yeah,

2361
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:59,430
maybe I'll do it like we're together and
she says blowing outside and then she 

2362
01:36:02,391 --> 01:36:07,391
would just walk out as you're trying to 
convince this girl that is totally 

2363
01:36:07,391 --> 01:36:07,391
normal.
Do you Have this on tape somewhere?

2364
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:09,400
It was so weird and no one got 
embarrassed for.

2365
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:09,740
Was like,
yeah,

2366
01:36:09,741 --> 01:36:10,940
she does it.
She's with her.

2367
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,970
Of course,
the girl said she was so confused by it.

2368
01:36:13,971 --> 01:36:15,080
She's like,
what is happening?

2369
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,600
It was really funny.
This awesome.

2370
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,570
Well,
that's pretty much easy.

2371
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:21,620
Jesus.
She's,

2372
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:25,190
oh no,
no.

2373
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:28,380
Your ex's into jesus.
You need to have her on a skeptic tank.

2374
01:36:28,381 --> 01:36:28,940
Hold on,
hold on,

2375
01:36:28,941 --> 01:36:33,941
hold on.
When was the last time you talked to 

2376
01:36:33,941 --> 01:36:33,941
her?
We text sometimes text.

2377
01:36:33,941 --> 01:36:36,710
What about in person?
But it's been about a year and a half in

2378
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:38,630
that time she went to jesus.
Jesus.

2379
01:36:38,631 --> 01:36:41,300
How long ago did you break up to years?
Three,

2380
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:42,740
four,
four,

2381
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:44,300
four or five?
No,

2382
01:36:44,301 --> 01:36:45,710
it was,
it was post the store.

2383
01:36:45,711 --> 01:36:46,910
We,
we just figured that out,

2384
01:36:46,911 --> 01:36:48,490
right?
That it's been five years since I went.

2385
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:51,670
I quit going to the store a sick.
Well,

2386
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,950
2007 was when I was in seventh.
So it was a.

2387
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:56,270
Yeah,
because when all that stuff happened,

2388
01:36:56,300 --> 01:37:00,230
I had someone else that I think we'd 
already broken up by the.

2389
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:02,240
Wow.
So it's a five years ago.

2390
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:07,330
Okay.
So a year and a half ago she got into 

2391
01:37:07,330 --> 01:37:07,330
jesus,
something like that.

2392
01:37:07,330 --> 01:37:09,620
I'm not good with time.
Marijuana is definitely ruined that.

2393
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:12,500
Is that a guy?
It's a guy that's.

2394
01:37:12,501 --> 01:37:13,200
No,
no,

2395
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:14,260
no.
It's just like,

2396
01:37:14,290 --> 01:37:19,290
you know,
she didn't want to do whatever she was 

2397
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:19,290
doing for people find that jesus.
So then she started saying that you kind

2398
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:19,940
of a sermon with me and I'm like,
stop,

2399
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:21,350
you know,
it's all I can do.

2400
01:37:21,351 --> 01:37:23,960
Dr mok you.
But meanwhile she tried to get me to go.

2401
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:26,000
Really intelligent.
That's weird.

2402
01:37:26,001 --> 01:37:31,001
She was a very intelligent person,
super smart people like like the jesus 

2403
01:37:31,001 --> 01:37:31,001
all the time.
I don't quite get it.

2404
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:34,310
I will.
I'll get her on that.

2405
01:37:34,370 --> 01:37:39,370
There's a harder.
They compartmentalize their logic is 

2406
01:37:39,370 --> 01:37:40,340
what it is and the idea behind it is 
great.

2407
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:42,800
The idea behind me,
if it was real,

2408
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:44,690
god damn it,
wouldn't it be beautiful?

2409
01:37:44,691 --> 01:37:49,691
Wouldn't it be beautiful?
They're really talking about need to 

2410
01:37:49,691 --> 01:37:49,720
find jesus.
Have you found jeans?

2411
01:37:50,530 --> 01:37:55,530
But they.
They're not lying to you when they say 

2412
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:57,461
that,
it's because if you really do believe 

2413
01:37:57,461 --> 01:37:57,461
that there's more fulfilled guess,
then it's

2414
01:37:57,461 --> 01:37:58,110
like,
I'm happy for you if you're happy,

2415
01:37:58,111 --> 01:38:02,480
but like she was in what she probably 
wasn't happy have,

2416
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,860
you know,
a lot of girls who do like,

2417
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:08,190
they get wild and they like blow guys 
the comedy store in front of people,

2418
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:09,870
you know,
like that kind of behavior,

2419
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,720
that kind of wild behavior.
That's fun.

2420
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:15,270
If you'rE around people who think it's 
fun,

2421
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:20,690
but if you're not a you get judged by 
enough people who don't think that shit 

2422
01:38:20,690 --> 01:38:25,341
is funny and if you're the type of 
person does like wild shit and tries to 

2423
01:38:25,341 --> 01:38:26,790
be funny and has tries to have a good 
time and it was a little impulsive,

2424
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:31,440
people will fucking judge you and to the
point where you start to think that your

2425
01:38:31,441 --> 01:38:35,430
morals are really questionable and 
you're a fucked up person.

2426
01:38:35,431 --> 01:38:40,431
You need to get your shit together and 
if you hear that enough and you don't 

2427
01:38:40,431 --> 01:38:40,431
have a support system,
you,

2428
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:43,460
you'll crack more.

2429
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,300
Let me think about it.
She's living with this guy.

2430
01:38:45,301 --> 01:38:46,890
I mean you're my friend.
You're here and everything like that,

2431
01:38:46,891 --> 01:38:48,660
but you're a brilliant guy.
Very,

2432
01:38:48,661 --> 01:38:50,550
very intelligent,
very educated,

2433
01:38:50,551 --> 01:38:54,000
very well read and your around her all 
the time.

2434
01:38:54,001 --> 01:38:59,001
So you were having intelligent 
conversations with her and if people 

2435
01:38:59,001 --> 01:39:02,481
don't have that in their life,
if all of sudden they get cut off from 

2436
01:39:02,481 --> 01:39:02,481
that and everyone just telling you,
dr.

2437
01:39:02,481 --> 01:39:03,030
Death,
morons,

2438
01:39:03,090 --> 01:39:08,090
and you're around a giant swarm of moron
influence and more on information.

2439
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:11,070
I was talking to people in minneapolis 
and they were like,

2440
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:16,100
what would you rather have a of virgin 
who's not good at sex or someone who's 

2441
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:17,220
very good effect,
but it had sex with a lot of people.

2442
01:39:17,221 --> 01:39:18,340
I'm like,
definitely the one that sucks.

2443
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:22,620
A lot of people were talking about sex 
with people and be like,

2444
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:23,310
yep,
fine.

2445
01:39:23,311 --> 01:39:25,860
That's fine.
What are you talking about?

2446
01:39:25,861 --> 01:39:26,700
Of course,
who cares?

2447
01:39:26,701 --> 01:39:28,530
We gas.
What do you care?

2448
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:31,400
So silly.
We get long season all diseased up.

2449
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:33,680
Oh yeah.
Why don't she don't got a virgin?

2450
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,860
I'm teaching teacher.
How did you like the virgin way?

2451
01:39:35,890 --> 01:39:37,280
Teach them how to do stuff.
She like,

2452
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:42,970
I don't want you sweating.
I feel bad like an unbeliever.

2453
01:39:44,881 --> 01:39:45,190
I gave him.

2454
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:49,890
Oh,
they're going to Cry and talk.

2455
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:57,150
he's like a virgin and haley wasn't part
of their deal.

2456
01:39:57,330 --> 01:39:58,880
Yeah,
you definitely want to go with the slot,

2457
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:00,840
but you don't want to go with the 
crying.

2458
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:06,140
Yeah.
You know the problem with the girls had 

2459
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:07,821
sex with a lot of people is a lot of 
times they feel bad about it or they've 

2460
01:40:07,821 --> 01:40:08,520
done it because there's some underlying 
issue.

2461
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:11,280
I think anyone I've been around a little
bit is like,

2462
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:16,310
just seems like they're cool with sex.
We'll have sex and we feel like having 

2463
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:16,310
some of them.
Some of them,

2464
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:19,080
yes and no.
I'm just saying the occasional bomb,

2465
01:40:19,081 --> 01:40:23,130
the occasional 110 that starts crying,
ruins all the rest of fun.

2466
01:40:23,131 --> 01:40:24,570
Girls.
Look at advisor.

2467
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:29,620
She hates sex.
She's talks about hoW she notes having 

2468
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:30,180
sex to backers.
Everybody wants to find out why does she

2469
01:40:30,181 --> 01:40:30,900
hate it?
I don't know.

2470
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:32,880
She's just as like a minute and a half.
I'm done.

2471
01:40:32,881 --> 01:40:37,881
I just wanted it to be to be over with.
It seemed super uncomfortable about a 

2472
01:40:37,881 --> 01:40:38,610
lot of shit though.
She's a strange girl.

2473
01:40:38,611 --> 01:40:40,770
She's super aggressive,
real competitive.

2474
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,780
Loves her dog.
Hold onto the dog too much.

2475
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:48,500
She's really quick,
real quick and aggressive at the 

2476
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:52,100
ceremony on his birthday last night and 
she didn't have her dog so I'm like 

2477
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:53,620
looking around interpersonal last night.
Like regular clothes high.

2478
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:53,960
Yeah.

2479
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,590
She changes in dress,
dress down before she goes on stage.

2480
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:02,920
She has as a comic,
she's want to get judged by anybody 

2481
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:02,920
looking at or anything like that.
She's got a great body,

2482
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:05,230
you put on a loose tee shirt and jeans 
and then she goes back to the car,

2483
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:07,150
gets into like nice clothes,
attractive clothes,

2484
01:41:07,151 --> 01:41:12,151
and then goes out with her.
I love sending her pictures of just 

2485
01:41:12,151 --> 01:41:14,170
random black dicks actually react to 
that.

2486
01:41:14,171 --> 01:41:16,180
She loves it.
She loves it.

2487
01:41:16,181 --> 01:41:21,181
She might be saving them up in a 
portfolio for when you start getting 

2488
01:41:21,181 --> 01:41:22,780
rich and she's going to fucking sue you.
You're right about that.

2489
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:24,490
Yeah.

2490
01:41:27,470 --> 01:41:32,470
I worry about that.
One person I talked to him about sexual 

2491
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:32,470
harassment if you just do it to a 
person,

2492
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:32,470
right?
Yeah.

2493
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:34,480
Yeah.
I don't man at this is this stupid,

2494
01:41:34,481 --> 01:41:39,481
scared,
loopy as fucking day in comics to 

2495
01:41:39,481 --> 01:41:40,060
comics.
I think you're safe doing that,

2496
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:41,980
you would think,
but I don't think it works that way.

2497
01:41:42,190 --> 01:41:44,350
The employee handbook for the lawyer 
comedy store,

2498
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:45,310
it said like,
uh,

2499
01:41:45,370 --> 01:41:48,430
you cannot say anything of a racial 
manner to another employee.

2500
01:41:48,431 --> 01:41:49,840
You cannot say anything of a sexual 
manner.

2501
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:51,580
And other employee it was like all these
rules,

2502
01:41:51,581 --> 01:41:52,630
but it goes,
but then it goes.

2503
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:57,720
With that being said,
you will hear from us stage some of the 

2504
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:58,540
worst imaginable language from any 
human.

2505
01:41:59,290 --> 01:42:04,290
That doesn't matter.
You still can't act like that to other 

2506
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:04,290
employees.
You'll hear horribly thing saying,

2507
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:05,770
super racist,
super sexist,

2508
01:42:05,771 --> 01:42:07,330
like every night.
Isn't that funny?

2509
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:10,480
If you work there and you're like a 
waiter and you try to be as funny as the

2510
01:42:10,490 --> 01:42:12,460
comedians,
the tee shirt on.

2511
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:13,840
Yeah,
you'd go to jail.

2512
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,020
They'll take eveRything.
It'll lawsuit.

2513
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:19,990
Let's take everything that.
Fuck you cnn.

2514
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:23,140
Here's an article,
george clooney still open to marriage.

2515
01:42:23,290 --> 01:42:28,290
Fuck.
They'll open America today in west 

2516
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:28,290
hollywood.
What?

2517
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:28,720
Uh,
thIs guy started.

2518
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:31,000
This is what I heard on the way here is 
I don't know what the full story,

2519
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:36,030
but the guy started,
this guy started walking around these 

2520
01:42:36,030 --> 01:42:37,510
houses and I kicking people's doors in 
and yelling and then,

2521
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:42,640
uh,
he kicked somebody door down and then 

2522
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:42,640
caught the house on fire and shot three 
people.

2523
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:48,180
And I get 30 2:38
year old women and a 34 year old guy 

2524
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:49,330
today.
Explain that again.

2525
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,370
What happened?
But he kicked sOmebody door down.

2526
01:42:51,371 --> 01:42:54,480
he started kicking the door down like 
pneuMonia,

2527
01:42:54,730 --> 01:42:59,730
melrose,
and then he just started fucking 

2528
01:42:59,730 --> 01:42:59,730
shooting people and then cotsen house on
fire,

2529
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:03,400
but they were still figuring it out 
while I was driving here and I go,

2530
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:05,710
wow,
we don't know what's going on.

2531
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:08,290
Wow.
That guy in Utah let his kids on fire.

2532
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:13,920
No,
he killed him with a hatchet and blew 

2533
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,650
the house uP and then lit it on fire.
They blew the house.

2534
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:17,880
Why I feel better about the he,
it's horrific.

2535
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:20,320
I thought he just lit them all on fire 
after bernadette.

2536
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:22,700
It's terrible.
What he did was they,

2537
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:27,720
a social worker came that was supposed 
to babysit him while he's with the kids 

2538
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:28,480
supposed to be there,
he's not supposed to have.

2539
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:30,520
And then they ran into the house.
He grabs them,

2540
01:43:30,521 --> 01:43:31,930
pulls them,
and pushes the guy out,

2541
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:34,180
kills the kids with a hammer.
The guy opens a door,

2542
01:43:34,181 --> 01:43:36,430
is smells gas,
and then the,

2543
01:43:36,431 --> 01:43:41,431
uh,
the guy who kills the kids with a 

2544
01:43:41,431 --> 01:43:42,931
hatchet rather blows up the house and 
kills all of them because if you can't 

2545
01:43:42,931 --> 01:43:42,931
have them,
no one can.

2546
01:43:42,931 --> 01:43:44,230
I don't knoW what the reason.
He lost custody.

2547
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:45,850
He'd killed the wife.
He killed.

2548
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:50,851
He had killed a white and he killed the 
wife and he was under suspicion of it 

2549
01:43:50,851 --> 01:43:52,400
and while he was under suspicion,
they pornography

2550
01:43:52,430 --> 01:43:54,320
questionable pornography on his 
computer.

2551
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:58,720
I heard it was what it was was he didn't
love his wife because he had worn.

2552
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:01,100
It was child porn,
but it was animated.

2553
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:04,370
Was animated child porn.
It's so weird.

2554
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:06,320
I didn't think they had.
This is by the way,

2555
01:44:06,930 --> 01:44:11,270
the third hand,
third hand information.

2556
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:16,370
Do you have the jerry sandusky was 
trying to gain the right to go onto his 

2557
01:44:16,370 --> 01:44:16,430
back porch.
Oh,

2558
01:44:16,431 --> 01:44:21,431
he was going on his back porch and while
he was there he was looking at an 

2559
01:44:21,431 --> 01:44:21,431
elementary school

2560
01:44:21,431 --> 01:44:24,520
in elementary school and that's where he
lives.

2561
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,580
So we can look at an elementary school 
that wasn't even part of the beginning.

2562
01:44:27,581 --> 01:44:28,720
Part of the story,
right?

2563
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:31,660
He's a monster.
That guy's a fucking mom.

2564
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:36,700
He wants.
He wants a chance to see his grandkids 

2565
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:36,700
so we can have one more before it goes 
away.

2566
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:38,210
It's so crazy that that guy got as far 
as taste,

2567
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:40,490
when you hear him talk about it,
it's scary.

2568
01:44:40,491 --> 01:44:45,491
It's just the way he talked about it.
Are you attracted to children?

2569
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:50,390
My attracted to children.
That's how he answered that.

2570
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:53,200
He didn't say no,
no,

2571
01:44:53,201 --> 01:44:54,070
no.
Stop.

2572
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:54,730
No,
no,

2573
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:58,090
of course not.
What I think he might be struggling with

2574
01:44:58,091 --> 01:44:58,900
it really,
really hard.

2575
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:01,480
Oh god.
Really say that.

2576
01:45:01,481 --> 01:45:04,300
Almost everybody that is in that sort of
a situation.

2577
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:06,300
Yeah.
Got molested when they were young.

2578
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:07,270
Yeah.
That's how.

2579
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:09,220
That's how those people reproduce.
Isn't that?

2580
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:12,040
That's their method of reproduction.
Fucking crazy thing.

2581
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:15,190
He's nuts.
That you can imprint that into a child's

2582
01:45:15,191 --> 01:45:15,700
mind.
you.

2583
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:18,040
I don't think it's 100 percent sure the 
space has moved on.

2584
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:20,440
There's a lot of people to get molested 
that don't wind up doing that and they,

2585
01:45:20,441 --> 01:45:25,441
you know,
it's like people who are around when 

2586
01:45:25,441 --> 01:45:28,030
their father beats their mother.
Some people they grow up to beat their 

2587
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:28,810
wife as well.
It becomes.

2588
01:45:28,811 --> 01:45:30,550
Or if your.
If your parents beat you,

2589
01:45:30,551 --> 01:45:33,400
you beat your kids and some of them it's
the opposite way.

2590
01:45:33,401 --> 01:45:35,920
They liked the snow land.
It depends if you like it.

2591
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:40,940
Like,
like when I got molested by that 

2592
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:40,940
babysitter I,
she was totally and I loved it.

2593
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:41,730
That's totally different.
You like what,

2594
01:45:41,731 --> 01:45:46,731
how will they be like 10 or 11?
And she was a chick and she was pretty 

2595
01:45:46,731 --> 01:45:49,990
and that was fun for me.
I'm such a difference between a guy 

2596
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:52,750
doing that to a little kid and a girl 
doing that to a little kid.

2597
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:57,800
Right.
So I don't want some chick blowing my 

2598
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:57,800
kids,
you know,

2599
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:00,811
I wouldn't want to come home and some 
fucking hot chick is blowing a 10 year 

2600
01:46:00,811 --> 01:46:01,270
old boy.
I wouldn't want to see that.

2601
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:03,910
That would be fucked up and you would 
have to call the cops and everything.

2602
01:46:03,911 --> 01:46:05,860
But man,
it would be the only thing that would be

2603
01:46:05,861 --> 01:46:08,290
traumatic as the poor guy would probably
be in love with her.

2604
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:09,600
You know,
you know when you.

2605
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:13,600
She's my favorite babysitter.
Why can't you hire her anymore?

2606
01:46:13,601 --> 01:46:18,601
She was telling other ones.
Now I'm friends with her on facebook 

2607
01:46:18,601 --> 01:46:18,640
because I hunted her down.
I want to marry her.

2608
01:46:18,641 --> 01:46:23,641
I want to play older.
Somebody put up a link,

2609
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:26,710
put up the link dog,
show me a picture on your phone.

2610
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:28,480
Just don't show it to the camps and just
tweet it.

2611
01:46:28,481 --> 01:46:30,710
No one's going to care.
People not sweet.

2612
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:32,380
It's like people on twitter are really 
cool.

2613
01:46:32,410 --> 01:46:33,580
You can tweet it.
Just a picture,

2614
01:46:33,581 --> 01:46:38,581
but don't put her name now.
I can't even do that shit too big 

2615
01:46:38,581 --> 01:46:38,890
nowadays.
The shit out that bitch.

2616
01:46:38,891 --> 01:46:40,300
What's her name?
Hang on.

2617
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:46,210
I almost fucking.
It sounded reasonable to and it came out

2618
01:46:46,211 --> 01:46:46,870
of your mouth.
I was like,

2619
01:46:46,871 --> 01:46:47,590
yeah,
like oh wait,

2620
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:48,720
no,
that's really good.

2621
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:50,220
Just first and last name.
Really

2622
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:54,820
good at convincing people.
Was the host of fear factor here,

2623
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:57,360
like it's way worse,
which by the way is canceled forever.

2624
01:46:57,390 --> 01:46:59,220
No,
it got canceled again for real.

2625
01:46:59,370 --> 01:47:01,170
Oh,
sorry.

2626
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:03,830
I'm sorry man.
That's okay.

2627
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:06,510
It's good.
I was 100 percent to horror like.

2628
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:08,960
Yeah.
Thank you very much.

2629
01:47:08,961 --> 01:47:13,961
I enjoyed the time.
I enjoyed hanging out with all the fear 

2630
01:47:13,961 --> 01:47:16,031
factor people.
There is a fucking awesome group of 

2631
01:47:16,031 --> 01:47:17,801
people,
but I'd rather do my own thing even 

2632
01:47:17,801 --> 01:47:17,801
though it was great money.
I'm not hurting for money.

2633
01:47:17,801 --> 01:47:18,490
I'm all right.
That's the only thing I feel bad for you

2634
01:47:18,491 --> 01:47:18,830
for.
It's like,

2635
01:47:18,831 --> 01:47:19,610
oh yeah,
it was,

2636
01:47:19,620 --> 01:47:21,260
it was fun money.
It was good.

2637
01:47:21,261 --> 01:47:23,030
But the reality is I,
I really,

2638
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:26,960
I enjoy working for the ufc and doing 
comedy 100 times more.

2639
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:28,940
It was,
it was okay to do.

2640
01:47:28,941 --> 01:47:33,941
It was fun.
It was fun to be back with all the 

2641
01:47:33,941 --> 01:47:35,891
people.
I loved all the people and work with 

2642
01:47:35,891 --> 01:47:35,891
them again.
But you know,

2643
01:47:35,891 --> 01:47:38,980
the difference between the enjoyment 
that you get of doing something that 

2644
01:47:38,980 --> 01:47:42,671
you've really loved doing the enjoyment 
was still a bad ass job as far as jobs 

2645
01:47:42,671 --> 01:47:42,671
go.

2646
01:47:42,671 --> 01:47:44,930
It was the fucking shit.
I would never complain about it.

2647
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:46,760
I have in the past and it sounds really 
douchey.

2648
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:48,310
That's a problem.
No one can really understand that.

2649
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:50,570
Understand that you get complacent with 
it.

2650
01:47:50,571 --> 01:47:53,330
Like you start expecting kind of money 
once you get it.

2651
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:55,820
It was fun because the people that are 
working with were fun.

2652
01:47:55,821 --> 01:47:57,140
And the cast of the,
the uh,

2653
01:47:57,141 --> 01:47:58,940
the brother,
the contestants this year were awesome.

2654
01:47:58,941 --> 01:48:01,940
There was a lot of great contestants,
a lot of really fucking funny people.

2655
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:07,300
Really crazy people,
but it is what it is and it's over the 

2656
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:11,470
end.
Apparently it was hard for them to get 

2657
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:11,470
advertisers for it.
Oh really?

2658
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:12,080
Damn.
You should have heard that donkey one.

2659
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:13,940
Yeah,
I got it on my phone.

2660
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:18,340
What is that?
Oh,

2661
01:48:18,341 --> 01:48:20,240
that's her.
That's her babysitter.

2662
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:21,440
Yeah.
Oh shit.

2663
01:48:21,470 --> 01:48:21,930
Let me see

2664
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:25,960
what it also does.
Some sunglasses indoors.

2665
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:27,770
She has a desk.
Yeah.

2666
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:29,920
Oh,
that's her now.

2667
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:30,970
Yeah.
That's not bad.

2668
01:48:31,810 --> 01:48:33,470
That's not bad.
Where's she live looking thin.

2669
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:35,970
Midwestern.
I say.

2670
01:48:36,170 --> 01:48:37,310
Yeah,
it was western.

2671
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:39,370
Did you catch that in the midwest?
That's totally fine.

2672
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:45,060
That's great dude.
She's like a black belt in karate or 

2673
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:47,400
something like nice kick your ass and 
yeah,

2674
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,420
she has a nice family now and yeah,
the kids.

2675
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:52,770
Yeah.
That's my.

2676
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:55,680
No.
Do you have a bit about it?

2677
01:48:55,681 --> 01:49:00,681
Yeah,
because I see it friday night at what 

2678
01:49:00,681 --> 01:49:02,720

2679
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:04,920
You go.

2680
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:11,250

2681

I'm going to try to get on barker

2682
01:49:12,950 --> 01:49:17,950
to come down as well because he just 
said that he's there friday night until 

2683
01:49:17,950 --> 01:49:21,191
monday afternoon.
Maybe I'll get him to come around and 

2684
01:49:21,191 --> 01:49:21,191
we'll do a podcast with him before the 
icehouse.

2685
01:49:21,191 --> 01:49:22,000
Awesome.
Smart.

2686
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:24,400
Yeah,
and from Australia for till monday.

2687
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:27,020
Said monday.
I'm an icehouse chronicles,

2688
01:49:27,021 --> 01:49:29,870
if you will.
We do is the ice house shows are some of

2689
01:49:29,871 --> 01:49:34,871
my favorite shows ever.
The standup shows and the podcast shows 

2690
01:49:34,871 --> 01:49:37,870
we do.
We have a studio in the ice house in 

2691
01:49:37,870 --> 01:49:41,261
pasadena.
It's a separate room and what we do is 

2692
01:49:41,261 --> 01:49:44,440
we start the show and we started a 
podcast just a little bit before the 

2693
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:47,561
show and then people just run back and 
do a set and then come back and hang 

2694
01:49:47,561 --> 01:49:48,290
out.
So fucking best

2695
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:49,500
hamburg.
It's hard.

2696
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:55,280
It's so fun.
The last one I got so fucking high from 

2697
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:55,930
that weed.
That's awesome.

2698
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:01,120
I,
I was shaking and then brody was 

2699
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:01,120
supposed to be out in front for me.
He's like,

2700
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:01,120
I can't.
Brody said like,

2701
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:02,200
I can't go up and I'm like,
you're king high.

2702
01:50:02,201 --> 01:50:03,850
And I'm like,
I've never been to stone before.

2703
01:50:04,530 --> 01:50:09,530
And I had to go up,
I was forced to go up and say had the 

2704
01:50:09,530 --> 01:50:09,530
best that I've ever had in my life.
Oh,

2705
01:50:09,530 --> 01:50:11,660
you can go.
Totally worked.

2706
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:16,010
It worked.
Or was it like that time in her life she

2707
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:21,580
had destroyed the support.
She kept saying she got high and wrote 

2708
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:21,580
it and she was like,
that sounds awesome.

2709
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:22,750
It was definitely the best.
What's the next morning?

2710
01:50:22,751 --> 01:50:25,840
It was a terrible report.
It wasn't joe.

2711
01:50:25,870 --> 01:50:27,490
Who is the rich girl.
Not purity.

2712
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:28,540
Blair blair.
Yeah.

2713
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:28,810
Yeah.
It was.

2714
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:31,540
It was kind of hot button.
Three words per page.

2715
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:33,670
She was a little chubby but hot.
She had to fight it.

2716
01:50:33,671 --> 01:50:35,860
I'm sure they had network heads.
Listen,

2717
01:50:36,110 --> 01:50:40,190
you need to eat less right now.
But she was a good kisser probably.

2718
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:43,120
She kiss you like you ice cream.
Oh god.

2719
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:46,330
I gotta watch that show again with with 
them in mind is just young,

2720
01:50:46,331 --> 01:50:48,430
young women.
Dirty boarding house.

2721
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:50,050
And how much were they fucking on the 
side?

2722
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:55,380
Probably a bunch toward.
For a woman who was in a position like 

2723
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:56,620
that where they become like super,
super successful,

2724
01:50:56,830 --> 01:51:01,830
it's probably hard for them to find 
mates if a woman is making a ton of 

2725
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:02,650
money,
like a jennifer aniston type woman.

2726
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:04,420
She's dating something like regular dude
now.

2727
01:51:04,421 --> 01:51:05,240
Right?
Isn't she date?

2728
01:51:05,241 --> 01:51:10,241
And some like regular guy.
It's hard to get someone to looking at 

2729
01:51:10,241 --> 01:51:10,241
you as a regular person.

2730
01:51:10,241 --> 01:51:10,241
Yeah.
It takes a long time.

2731
01:51:10,241 --> 01:51:10,750
Well,
not only that man.

2732
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:16,020
I think for women it's like a normal 
thing for the man to be more successful 

2733
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:16,020
than the woman.
Yeah.

2734
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:17,920
And when the woman is like way more 
successful than the man,

2735
01:51:17,950 --> 01:51:19,850
I think it gets sketchy.
Yeah.

2736
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:24,960
You know,
I was in some way to your room at some 

2737
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:24,960
of something like tennis or something.
And uh,

2738
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:25,420
I saw a magazine with one hot chick 
from,

2739
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:30,470
um,
not the 100 proof from the desperate 

2740
01:51:30,470 --> 01:51:31,330
housewives,
the one he's been superman,

2741
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:32,830
lois and superman.
Oh,

2742
01:51:32,831 --> 01:51:37,831
the fake.
Even not even the glory of the one who 

2743
01:51:37,831 --> 01:51:37,831
is just slightly less hot that eva 
longoria.

2744
01:51:37,831 --> 01:51:38,630
Oh,
tara.

2745
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:42,120
Tara hatchet teri hatcher.
Terri hatcher.

2746
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:47,460
Geriatric care was waY hotter.
We ended up getting a taro patch in 

2747
01:51:48,010 --> 01:51:50,650
where it would be a shit if they just 
put her on one of those shows,

2748
01:51:51,270 --> 01:51:52,510
but she said from now on,
she's like,

2749
01:51:52,511 --> 01:51:54,220
she's not going to look like herself.

2750
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:59,220
Pay for a date.
She still expects everyone to pay 

2751
01:51:59,220 --> 01:51:59,220
realize.
Yeah,

2752
01:51:59,220 --> 01:51:59,560
because that's hoW it works.
What?

2753
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:00,970
No,
that's ridiculous.

2754
01:52:00,971 --> 01:52:05,971
She's worth like $100.
What do you mean you have so much more 

2755
01:52:05,971 --> 01:52:05,971
money than me?
Just pay for it.

2756
01:52:05,971 --> 01:52:05,971
Yeah.
No,

2757
01:52:05,971 --> 01:52:10,720
I mean you have to pay for it.
You have to buy her dinner and then beg 

2758
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:11,750
for sex,
you know,

2759
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:15,250
and then you know,
it's just probably not India anyway,

2760
01:52:15,251 --> 01:52:17,670
so probably not.
Yeah.

2761
01:52:17,671 --> 01:52:20,980
You would have to be like some brad pitt
to over stimulate a woman like that.

2762
01:52:20,981 --> 01:52:25,981
Oh yeah.
You'd have to be like someone's even 

2763
01:52:25,981 --> 01:52:25,981
more famous than her,
or even more powerful than her.

2764
01:52:25,981 --> 01:52:27,780
I mean,
I would think you would say no.

2765
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:29,940
Mean people tell you you fucking 
ridiculous.

2766
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:31,750
Your point of view is stupid.
It's asinine.

2767
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:33,820
There is a certain chimpanzee,
logical.

2768
01:52:33,850 --> 01:52:35,200
They want someone to do that to them.

2769
01:52:35,230 --> 01:52:37,840
They want an alpha.
They want sometimes some people,

2770
01:52:38,230 --> 01:52:40,310
even the ones that don't matter,
how long do they last?

2771
01:52:40,870 --> 01:52:43,300
Like our friend for instance,
who will remain nameless,

2772
01:52:43,450 --> 01:52:46,820
who recently left his girl who also 
remain nameless,

2773
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,490
and he was in the beta position during 
the entire relationship.

2774
01:52:49,730 --> 01:52:50,810
I knew.
I'm like,

2775
01:52:50,811 --> 01:52:53,390
this shit ain't gonna work.
How the fuck is this going to work?

2776
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:56,030
Women like that alwaYs complained that 
the dude does it.

2777
01:52:56,031 --> 01:53:01,031
The other ones don't work.
Either those ones will have Better 

2778
01:53:01,031 --> 01:53:01,031
relationships,
but he was.

2779
01:53:01,031 --> 01:53:01,680
The alpha doesn't worK either.
Then was he ever the.

2780
01:53:01,681 --> 01:53:04,760
I don't know what he talking about.
How dare you?

2781
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:06,640
I've never seen that.
Turn around.

2782
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:09,370
Make shit up.
Anyway,

2783
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:14,380
go to a go to joe rogan.net.
Check out the information for all the 

2784
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:16,130
upcoming shows.

2785
01:53:16,670 --> 01:53:20,030

marcia,

2786
01:53:20,350 --> 01:53:21,380
are you first weekend?

2787
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:23,360
Powerful art should fear will be with 
me,

2788
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,250
California.
Oh great.

2789
01:53:25,490 --> 01:53:26,600
Yeah,

2790
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:28,070
Arusha.
Fear.

2791
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:31,190
There you go.
Folks saw that booked on the spot.

2792
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:36,430
That's how we do the aprIl 13th through 
15th.

2793
01:53:36,681 --> 01:53:40,460
I met the hollywood Florida improv.
Oh shit.

2794
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:44,960
That's the hard rock down there.
Crazy one for 20 atlanta,

2795
01:53:44,961 --> 01:53:47,000
Georgia.
That's a tabernacle.

2796
01:53:47,030 --> 01:53:50,060
Tickets go on sale tomorrow and then on 
May 4th,

2797
01:53:50,150 --> 01:53:51,440
New York city.
The what is it?

2798
01:53:51,441 --> 01:53:54,540
The fucking manhattan theater mandira.
Sure.

2799
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:57,890
That today I in and I'm in alberta.
Calgary.

2800
01:53:57,891 --> 01:54:02,891
Remember the place we did in calgary?
We had to have in the rounds for seats 

2801
01:54:02,891 --> 01:54:02,891
behind you?
Yeah,

2802
01:54:02,891 --> 01:54:03,080
we had a great.
That was awesome.

2803
01:54:03,081 --> 01:54:05,450
We need to play Japan while we're there.
There's a comedy store in.

2804
01:54:05,451 --> 01:54:07,370
They're in Japan or something like I 
want to just go hang out.

2805
01:54:07,371 --> 01:54:12,371
If you want to go to the comedy store,
we'll go and isn't there one like a 

2806
01:54:12,371 --> 01:54:14,690
comedy store in the company in Brazil 
was fun just to hang out.

2807
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:18,860
We had a good time already and I had 
some real brazilian shoe.

2808
01:54:18,861 --> 01:54:20,910
Haas Korea.
Food was so good.

2809
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:24,290
We went back,
we went back to the so good.

2810
01:54:24,291 --> 01:54:27,380
So many different flavors to.
To rio is amazing.

2811
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:28,940
That's why I got those coconut water.
I finally,

2812
01:54:28,941 --> 01:54:33,941
I was just walking on the beach and just
like they have sold those coconut or 

2813
01:54:33,941 --> 01:54:34,790
whatever and they just chop it open and 
give you a straw.

2814
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:36,300
You know,
they sell that here in los angeles,

2815
01:54:36,301 --> 01:54:41,301
so it's fruit stands at any mexican when
the fruit shop coconuts and they just 

2816
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:45,500
sent me about that by me.
And your idea is columbus,

2817
01:54:45,501 --> 01:54:49,220
Ohio When you're doing that week in May 
19th,

2818
01:54:49,221 --> 01:54:51,260
yeah.
They asked for me and joey.

2819
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:52,570
That's awesome.
Crazy.

2820
01:54:52,850 --> 01:54:53,730
Awesome.
Perfect.

2821
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:55,010
The first time I ever on the road.
Yeah.

2822
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:58,450
19th something like count your tickets.
You know what I'm saying?

2823
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:00,270
Can't get tickets to that guy.
You know,

2824
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:03,460
it was going to make some posters.
I might bring a desk,

2825
01:55:03,461 --> 01:55:08,461
one poster who was um,
who was booked this to joey booking 

2826
01:55:08,461 --> 01:55:11,500
jelly booked that some woman came up to 
him and said that she wanted to book me 

2827
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:11,500
and joey.
That's awesome.

2828
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:14,180
Beautiful.
At the same club,

2829
01:55:14,181 --> 01:55:16,010
the funny bone.
AnD then we're trying to do,

2830
01:55:16,150 --> 01:55:21,150
uh,
we're also doing maybe scully's on Ohio 

2831
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:23,861
state campus or we might do cleveland.
The funny letters go somewhere else to 

2832
01:55:23,861 --> 01:55:28,090
cleveland's good to skip over.
Do the improv and cleveland the funny 

2833
01:55:28,090 --> 01:55:28,490
bone.
And this is an awesome fucking club.

2834
01:55:28,491 --> 01:55:31,070
So that's one of the,
one of the great clubs in the country as

2835
01:55:31,071 --> 01:55:35,330
far as like how it's low and tight.
That's a great fucking place.

2836
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:37,340
Alright.
So that's all that information.

2837
01:55:37,341 --> 01:55:39,730
Higher primate dr.
Fuck yeah.

2838
01:55:39,731 --> 01:55:40,150
What do you got?

2839
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:40,970
Well,
in march,

2840
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:41,870
March 15th,
I'm going,

2841
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:43,800
I'm easton,
Maryland.

2842
01:55:43,801 --> 01:55:48,801
At the avalon theater.
Do you have a website where everybody 

2843
01:55:48,801 --> 01:55:48,990
can see all your data?
You don't remember this or the.com?

2844
01:55:49,110 --> 01:55:51,090
Boom.
You can remember that.

2845
01:55:51,230 --> 01:55:56,230
Or all a r I s h a f f I r on twitter.
I'll be an addison on April 12th through

2846
01:56:00,151 --> 01:56:04,110
the 15th at the addison improv.
Let me headline the headline.

2847
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:09,230
That's awesome dude.
Addison texts and this is the shit 

2848
01:56:09,230 --> 01:56:11,090
addison apparently was the one city,
uh,

2849
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:13,860
in dallas back in the olden days where 
you could drink.

2850
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:14,790
Oh,
rose wides,

2851
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:19,680
wild.
It's like really was during prohibition.

2852
01:56:19,681 --> 01:56:22,080
They used to have weird laws about the 
city of dallas,

2853
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,690
but addison was where you can go to 
drink and smoke.

2854
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:27,240
Remember,
I think you might still be able to smoke

2855
01:56:27,241 --> 01:56:32,241
in the club.
It might be one of the last places that 

2856
01:56:32,241 --> 01:56:32,241
maybe they changed that.

2857
01:56:32,241 --> 01:56:33,090
I hope they didn't.
Even though I hate cigarettes,

2858
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:36,000
I also like personal freedom.
Yeah,

2859
01:56:36,050 --> 01:56:38,220
that's the problem.
That's the one where the fringe.

2860
01:56:38,230 --> 01:56:39,330
Not other people.
Yeah,

2861
01:56:39,350 --> 01:56:40,590
so we're stinky.
Well,

2862
01:56:40,591 --> 01:56:43,650
the real issue is for work.
They're stinky,

2863
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:46,740
but it's also.
There's something about girls that smoke

2864
01:56:47,010 --> 01:56:47,700
there,
sluttier.

2865
01:56:47,900 --> 01:56:51,630
She'll just know that they make 
decisions that just don't matter.

2866
01:56:51,690 --> 01:56:52,650
Yeah,
they're crazy bitches.

2867
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:57,680
They're throwing cigarettes out the 
window and they don't even thinking 

2868
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:59,010
about where it goes in to sign.
The chevron addict down their mouth.

2869
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:04,100
The loads go off.
They're not thinking about what's going 

2870
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:06,261
in there.
They're not thinking about that sticky 

2871
01:57:06,261 --> 01:57:07,911
dick.
They just send out a hundred percent of 

2872
01:57:07,911 --> 01:57:07,911
the time.
It helps your odds.

2873
01:57:07,911 --> 01:57:10,950
It increases the odds of finding a way 
to actually see a girl with red nail 

2874
01:57:11,041 --> 01:57:16,041
polish and she's chewing gum and she 
spits her gum out into the bushes and 

2875
01:57:16,041 --> 01:57:16,440
then lights a cigarette.

2876
01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:18,520
That girl might suck dick.
I said,

2877
01:57:18,530 --> 01:57:20,850
what are we doing later?
That girl might be crazy.

2878
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:25,880
She's not thinking about shit.
She's just living for momentary little 

2879
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:31,160
blips of thrills.
If you're interested in coming to the 

2880
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:31,950
ice house,
go to,

2881
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:34,020
what is it?
Ice house comedy.com.

2882
01:57:34,021 --> 01:57:35,760
And search for joe rogan.
Where?

2883
01:57:35,761 --> 01:57:36,870
Death squad?
Yes.

2884
01:57:36,871 --> 01:57:38,370
Stage two.
Stage two,

2885
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:40,620
because that's what we're doing.
And matt in march,

2886
01:57:40,621 --> 01:57:43,620
we're going to do a fuckload dates there
because I'm going to be around.

2887
01:57:43,621 --> 01:57:46,340
Most of them are mr.
Fear factor.

2888
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:49,650
I think you're off the fact.
Forgot about that girl.

2889
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:54,680
That girl in the last monster.
You're going to tell you friends having 

2890
01:57:56,250 --> 01:58:00,480
something with our friend aside.
A little accent is just so bad and while

2891
01:58:00,481 --> 01:58:01,960
they were doing it,
she was going again.

2892
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:05,810
Italia France.
You got to tell you a friend.

2893
01:58:07,210 --> 01:58:09,870
Yeah.
He told us this because it was gross.

2894
01:58:10,710 --> 01:58:13,320
He told us the opposite.
That liKe he was a stud.

2895
01:58:13,330 --> 01:58:14,520
I'm bragging,
I'm pillows.

2896
01:58:14,521 --> 01:58:17,580
how sad it was.
Harry is sobering up.

2897
01:58:17,581 --> 01:58:22,581
Well,
he's half hard inside of her and she's 

2898
01:58:22,581 --> 01:58:24,291
going again.
I know I saw a girl walk across That.

2899
01:58:27,521 --> 01:58:28,440
That old.
What was it?

2900
01:58:28,441 --> 01:58:30,930
Old room,
but they don't have any more connection.

2901
01:58:31,550 --> 01:58:34,200
Connection and she was super hot.
Walked all The way across the room,

2902
01:58:34,201 --> 01:58:36,230
like outside there was like,
whoosh,

2903
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:38,310
just looking right at me and she just 
comes over.

2904
01:58:38,311 --> 01:58:39,930
She was one of the bathroom,
but she stopped and came to me.

2905
01:58:39,931 --> 01:58:40,680
She goes,
Yeah,

2906
01:58:40,681 --> 01:58:43,120
well pesi funny or whatever.
Crap,

2907
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:45,410
go.
Piss off.

2908
01:58:46,110 --> 01:58:50,960
Wicked has killed it all.
You just teach her to talk different.

2909
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:52,050
She'd be fine.
Yeah,

2910
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:54,670
you can do that though.
Wouldn't have the patience to do that.

2911
01:58:54,730 --> 01:58:56,680
You know,
that girl used to from Texas?

2912
01:58:56,750 --> 01:58:57,520
Uh,
jessica,

2913
01:58:57,521 --> 01:59:00,610
she,
she would like have the thickest.

2914
01:59:00,610 --> 01:59:02,380
When I first met her at the thickest 
accent,

2915
01:59:02,381 --> 01:59:07,381
it was just like,
all y'all sound like she was a 

2916
01:59:07,381 --> 01:59:07,381
hillbilly,
that she moved to la,

2917
01:59:07,381 --> 01:59:11,560
completely lost it and then move back.
But when she went home to visit it came 

2918
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:14,680
back a little stronger.
I would have asked her to keep it.

2919
01:59:14,681 --> 01:59:16,620
I love that accident.
Texas oxidants.

2920
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:19,870
My favorite was a real women.
Those are women,

2921
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:21,400
you know what I mean?
They like want to be women.

2922
01:59:21,401 --> 01:59:23,200
They don't want to be president and they
want to be running shit.

2923
01:59:23,330 --> 01:59:25,250
They like to be in women.
The man,

2924
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:28,960
the areas where the men are manly,
like who's manlier than Texas dudes,

2925
01:59:28,961 --> 01:59:33,961
you know,
it's like big belt buckles and fucking 

2926
01:59:33,961 --> 01:59:33,961
trucks in the.
Mainly those are the women,

2927
01:59:33,961 --> 01:59:35,680
the women you know.
Whereas you get to san francisco,

2928
01:59:35,681 --> 01:59:40,681
you get chicks and one a fucking stuff,
a birkenstock up your ass scream at you 

2929
01:59:40,681 --> 01:59:42,250
because you know you don't want to give 
them the right to choose.

2930
01:59:42,850 --> 01:59:46,760
Obviously these are generalizations,
generalizations.

2931
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:51,810
We're just talking here.
It's impossible for girls in Texas even 

2932
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:52,540
roll their eyes really well either.
Just so laid back.

2933
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:57,940
Go to higher primate.com.
If you're interested in monkeys and weed

2934
01:59:57,941 --> 02:00:00,640
and psychedelics.
That's my teacher at line.

2935
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:05,700
Brian's reminded me.
He's right and you need sales to sales 

2936
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:05,700
or coupons for that.
Okay.

2937
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:10,531
I'll get a coupon stuff that you're not 
going to sell much more around for 

2938
02:00:10,531 --> 02:00:11,530
awhile.
You got to keep on asking me this.

2939
02:00:11,540 --> 02:00:13,710
You need to make a coupon code.
You know what bands deal.

2940
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:16,660
This is why my new thing.
I think you should do it as a teacher of

2941
02:00:16,661 --> 02:00:18,640
the year every year.
Some new design.

2942
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:19,420
Oh,
that's a good idea.

2943
02:00:19,421 --> 02:00:21,060
You know,
because they had the old last year,

2944
02:00:21,061 --> 02:00:22,570
his teacher that's 50 percent off.
You know,

2945
02:00:22,580 --> 02:00:27,580
we should do.
We should do a jo rogan experience 

2946
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:28,020
podcast tee shirt by this dude,
which worldwide sweatpants,

2947
02:00:28,030 --> 02:00:28,870
whatever the fuck his name is.

2948
02:00:29,930 --> 02:00:31,990
Foremost sweat pants,
sweatpants.

2949
02:00:31,991 --> 02:00:36,991
That's not like Mike Maxwell,
but maxwell did a great job with the 

2950
02:00:36,991 --> 02:00:38,020
chicago posters to have this guy.
Awesome guy do it to a tee shirt,

2951
02:00:38,021 --> 02:00:40,870
but like,
that's not a bad idea.

2952
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:43,330
What should it be on it?
The death Squad cat.

2953
02:00:43,940 --> 02:00:44,780
Tired of that.
Capra.

2954
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:50,340
especially when you changed.
I'm just going to change them just to 

2955
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:54,781
fuck monkey todd over.
I changed it because those guys would 

2956
02:00:54,781 --> 02:00:57,430
have the tattoo you marketing tool.
That's why I said like,

2957
02:00:57,431 --> 02:00:58,500
hey,
I'm going to get a tattoo.

2958
02:00:58,510 --> 02:00:59,530
I'm like,
don't do that.

2959
02:00:59,570 --> 02:01:04,570
I'm what?
Don't fucking build heroes out of 

2960
02:01:04,570 --> 02:01:04,570
nowhere.
Well,

2961
02:01:04,570 --> 02:01:04,570
it's cool.
It's like you old marvel logo.

2962
02:01:04,570 --> 02:01:06,670
It's kind of hipper.
The old cat.

2963
02:01:06,790 --> 02:01:07,660
ExactlY.
Yeah.

2964
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:08,530
A marketing.
Oh yeah.

2965
02:01:08,531 --> 02:01:09,700
Right.
It's good move.

2966
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:11,530
We started this new drink at the comedy 
store.

2967
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:12,880
It's called suck my cock.
No,

2968
02:01:12,881 --> 02:01:15,420
it's delicious.
ShIrley's conscious.

2969
02:01:15,450 --> 02:01:16,930
Delicious with,
with,

2970
02:01:17,330 --> 02:01:18,100
with.
What's it called?

2971
02:01:18,101 --> 02:01:19,530
Rum.
Cherry rum.

2972
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:20,440
Oh,
what is it?

2973
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:25,940
Shirley temple with cherry rum in it.
And so at first we called it surely 

2974
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:29,500
period,
but then we thought that just wouldn't 

2975
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:30,130
catch on enough.
So he called temple of doom way.

2976
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:31,420
Yeah,
exactly.

2977
02:01:31,421 --> 02:01:32,890
So now it's just going to be,
hey,

2978
02:01:32,891 --> 02:01:34,250
you know what they originally called 
this.

2979
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:36,520
Oh,
this will be part of the folklore.

2980
02:01:36,521 --> 02:01:39,010
And so that's a drink that they sell the
store now you.

2981
02:01:39,630 --> 02:01:40,730
Yeah.
Oh that's cool.

2982
02:01:40,731 --> 02:01:43,330
So you only the front bar would know 
about it and I guess the backbar.

2983
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:47,530
Well if you order it though,
someone could ask some of the more there

2984
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:49,520
if you're working.
Yeah.

2985
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:51,860
And they get order.
Probably anytime the front bars up on.

2986
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:56,880
they'll know now everybody knows now.
Do you get like a copyright on that 

2987
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:00,820
already?
Just some satisfaction of knowing you 

2988
02:02:00,820 --> 02:02:00,820
have something to do with it.

2989
02:02:00,820 --> 02:02:03,610
That'd be bad aSs.
We were in vegas a couple of years from 

2990
02:02:03,610 --> 02:02:05,441
now.
We were at temple of doom and everybody 

2991
02:02:05,441 --> 02:02:05,441
knew what it was.
It's so delicious.

2992
02:02:05,441 --> 02:02:06,550
right before you had sex,
you could have any super alcoholic.

2993
02:02:06,551 --> 02:02:08,290
You can't taste it.
Podcasts over brian,

2994
02:02:09,030 --> 02:02:10,510
how dare you?
Uh,

2995
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:15,790
so we'll,
we'll try to get arch bargain for 

2996
02:02:15,790 --> 02:02:15,790
tomorrow.
No guaranteeS though,

2997
02:02:15,790 --> 02:02:15,790
but for sure we were doing this house 
chronicles,

2998
02:02:15,850 --> 02:02:18,050
you think they might send me to 
Australia to what?

2999
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:20,050
For september to do like a run of the 
city's.

3000
02:02:20,170 --> 02:02:20,860
Oh,
one night.

3001
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:22,510
In each city.
They might send you who?

3002
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:27,560
The agent got married there.
I don't know if you've talked a list 

3003
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:27,560
type talk.
Talking bill.

3004
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:27,560
Oh,
that's cool.

3005
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:29,080
Isn't that the people that we worked 
with were there,

3006
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:29,900
is it?
Yeah,

3007
02:02:29,901 --> 02:02:30,660
I'm pretty sure.
Yeah,

3008
02:02:30,661 --> 02:02:31,420
they cool.
Oh yeah,

3009
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:32,540
yeah,
yeah,

3010
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:33,320
yeah,
they were great.

3011
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:34,820
Yeah,
Australia is awesome man.

3012
02:02:34,821 --> 02:02:36,890
It's just too far away.
I'm a,

3013
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:41,930
I would go for like two weeks for those 
asking about the ufc in Australia.

3014
02:02:41,931 --> 02:02:46,931
I'm not going,
I'm not going to any of the fx or fuel 

3015
02:02:46,931 --> 02:02:48,710
shows that there are four channels I'm 
doing.

3016
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:52,040
I'm doing only the oneS that are on 
paper view and the fox ones,

3017
02:02:52,070 --> 02:02:54,200
those are the ones I'm doing it.
So I got to watch last night,

3018
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:56,870
jake ellenberger and diego sanchez went 
to a war.

3019
02:02:56,871 --> 02:02:58,490
Holy shit.
That was a great fight.

3020
02:02:59,030 --> 02:03:00,550
Classic fight of the year,
Canada.

3021
02:03:00,551 --> 02:03:02,300
They should do one of those tests now 
that you're not going to.

3022
02:03:02,301 --> 02:03:03,850
Totally shoot.
We should've done it tonight.

3023
02:03:04,370 --> 02:03:05,360
Next time.
Next time.

3024
02:03:05,361 --> 02:03:07,260
We'll do that.
We'll do a drunk caSt plan.

3025
02:03:07,690 --> 02:03:08,260
Yeah,
we'll,

3026
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:09,710
we'll do it.
We'll broadcast.

3027
02:03:09,711 --> 02:03:10,790
Uh,
I've never done it.

3028
02:03:10,791 --> 02:03:11,380
I'll bring it.
I'll put,

3029
02:03:11,390 --> 02:03:13,160
you know what?
I'll set up a second tv in here.

3030
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:15,990
I'll bring a tv in here.
We just do at the ice house or we do.

3031
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:21,040
You don't have a tv.
The ice house and we're not going to do 

3032
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:21,040
it illegal.
You know,

3033
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:22,670
we don't have to do illegal right now.
Next box.

3034
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:23,860
Oh,
you read it on an xbox?

3035
02:03:23,861 --> 02:03:24,890
Yeah.
Really?

3036
02:03:24,891 --> 02:03:27,080
Yeah.
Or just get me an xbox code from dana.

3037
02:03:27,530 --> 02:03:28,920
I'm sure he had someone who can get you 
and hey,

3038
02:03:28,930 --> 02:03:30,410
we got this code.
I'd rather pay for it.

3039
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:31,100
Like,
oh god damn.

3040
02:03:31,101 --> 02:03:32,310
Good citizen.

3041
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:33,640
50 bucks.
We have nothing.

3042
02:03:33,710 --> 02:03:34,100
I'll tell you.
Like,

3043
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:37,700
oh,
probably if it's the private stuff.

3044
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:39,770
Oh the guys who sent us the super cool 
bond.

fucked up and you need to go.
Go to kill yourself.

3081
02:04:58,410 --> 02:05:01,530
That's pretentious enough and it's only 
because I'm a huge jimmy hendrix fan.

3082
02:05:02,210 --> 02:05:04,380
I basically ganged it.

3143
02:07:38,050 --> 02:07:40,030
and we actually hired a scientific 
advisor.

you.

you grow with us.

3150
02:07:51,970 --> 02:07:53,770
You are not the you,

3151
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:57,850
You are the accumulation of all your 
life's experiences and from now on,

3152
02:07:58,180 --> 02:08:00,620

heavy shit together.

3154
02:08:02,590 --> 02:08:07,590
Be the hero in your own story.
There should be an after the marines 

3155
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:07,590
should.
It should be a fucking recruit an agent.

3156
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:08,170
I'm gonna.
Start my own marines.

3157
02:08:08,590 --> 02:08:11,040
Someday.
We're going to get our cult.

3158
02:08:11,130 --> 02:08:12,310
We're going to.
We're going to start one.

3159
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:13,960
We're definitely going to start a 
compound.

3160
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:16,240
You want to build the house I'm thinking
of for no bullshit.

3161
02:08:16,241 --> 02:08:17,770
I'm thinking of buying a giant chunk of 
land.

3162
02:08:17,810 --> 02:08:19,480
Meadow lake,
and we all build houses.

3163
02:08:19,481 --> 02:08:21,780
They're Just build a like amish people.
Yeah.

3164
02:08:22,010 --> 02:08:23,960
Well listen man,
the land,

3165
02:08:24,310 --> 02:08:29,310
I will buy the land so we'll own the 
land and then allow all my friends to 

3166
02:08:29,310 --> 02:08:33,361
come and build up houses.
Let's just have some bad ass houses on 

3167
02:08:33,361 --> 02:08:33,490
this piece of public.
Does that tell you a good idea?

3168
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:35,110
And if we hear the incoming sooner like 
a,

3169
02:08:35,150 --> 02:08:40,150
you want to go over there and do it,
I wouldn't be willing to do fear factor 

3170
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:40,150
for one more season just for the money 
for that.

3171
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:41,950
I think it's a good idea.
You're willing to for a factor anyway,

3172
02:08:41,951 --> 02:08:44,110
for one more time.
I would've kept going.

3173
02:08:44,140 --> 02:08:45,970
That's why I'm glad I had that terrible 
bargaining.

3174
