1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,610
Mm,
Tom,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,870
Papa,
ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,010
we're live.
Hello.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,133
It's good to be here.
So this is a statistic that I was going 

5
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:11,520
to tell you.
If you divvied up all the money,

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,120
all the money in the entire country,
all the money that we have,

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,590
everyone would get $179,000
that's it.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,080
That's a lot.
That's all the money.

9
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:22,923
The U s 300 million people,
according to the 2010 Federal Reserve 

10
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:29,400
documents.
So it's a few years old.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,833
Their total net,
net worth of all us households and 

12
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:38,271
nonprofits is around 54 point $9 
trillion.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,600
All right,
so that's $179,000

14
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:47,370
per person based on 307 million people.
Is that include children?

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,261
Yeah,
three of them.

16
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:52,380
7 million people.
So your kids would get a hundred grand,

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,440
179 that's pretty sweet.
That's pretty sweet.

18
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:58,890
Your 11 year old fat with cash.
Finally,

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,810
imagine the 11 year old or the hundred 
and $79,000

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,770
how much candy can you buy?
They go,

21
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:08,604
fucking crazy.
Pool is filled with inflatable 

22
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,600
flamingos.

23
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,483
Yeah,
there's a reason why you shouldn't be 

24
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:18,160
allowed to have that kind of money.
Like Matt,

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,590
when I was at Disneyland,
um,

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,270
I was,
um,

27
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,040
talking to this guide and a real nice 
guy.

28
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:24,874
He's super cool because he's got like so
much knowledge about Disneyland and 

29
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,461
shortest.
No,

30
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:31,590
his name is philander.
That's his actual name,

31
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,370
which is not a philanderer.
Very nice gentleman.

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,520
But he was talking to me about,
um,

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,840
sometimes they have a,
like a prince from like,

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,700
uh,
one of these Middle Eastern countries.

35
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,280
And one time it was a little boy and he 
was five years old.

36
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,920
Oh Man.
And he had all these grown men,

37
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:53,881
like,
you know,

38
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:58,670
40 year old men around him if that had 
to listen to every fucking word he said.

39
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,370
He said it had to run over with candy.
Fun to see the mouse.

40
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,680
Yeah.
He does whatever he wants.

41
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,200
And he's five.
That's crazy.

42
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,600
Yeah.
They said he has like ungodly amounts of

43
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,860
money.
He could do whatever you want.

44
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:17,780
I mean,
literally probably worth $1 billion guys

45
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,623
five.
So he's probably just becoming aware of 

46
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:23,700
his power.
I think he's always been aware.

47
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:25,240
I think or yeah,
I mean,

48
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,260
but I think his model of how people are 
because they're servants all servants.

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,450
Yeah,
he's royalty.

50
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,020
My kids would be awful if they were in 
charge.

51
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,323
You would be,
I would be the idea that you could take 

52
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,624
a five year old kid and give him ungodly
amounts of money and power is kind of 

53
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,513
insane.
Especially with their mood swings at 

54
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:49,824
that age.
They're all like in the middle of his 

55
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:53,880
knee and like I want to go to the 
airplane now.

56
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,773
I want an airplane.
Now what's funny with kids is when they 

57
00:02:56,761 --> 00:03:00,040
get tired they just can't deal.
Oh

58
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,740
my God,
they just fall apart.

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,830
But my favorite is when my daughter goes
carry me.

60
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,860
Like she's like,
can you imagine you get to a point where

61
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:10,930
you just like,
you have to lift me around.

62
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,630
I know it's too much effort to try to 
walk.

63
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,860
Carry me.
Still does that at 11 and it's just like

64
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:20,230
I can't,
I physically can't.

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,800
I can for two steps and then when 
wouldn't you down what?

66
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,180
His 11 year old way.

67
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,170
11 or she told me the other day,
I think like 89.

68
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,240
It's too big and long.
It's long.

69
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,030
You're picking her up and her legs are 
dragging on the ground.

70
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:35,800
He,
especially if they want you to carry him

71
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,380
like a baby,
you're carrying a log.

72
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,150
You know,
like you can like lumber.

73
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,060
I wouldn't want to walk.
It's like if I had to carry,

74
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,233
like I can carry my wife.
Like I could feel my shoulders like a 

75
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:51,640
fireman's carry.
Right.

76
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,553
But that's not it.
But nobody wants to be carried like 

77
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:54,460
that.
No.

78
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,290
Nobody wants to be on,
you know,

79
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,040
they want to be a little little cuddle.
They want him nuzzle in.

80
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,560
They don't want to make it easy on your 
arms or your body.

81
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,180
They have no idea.
Nobody does squats with like in the curl

82
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,014
position.
You don't like do a curl and then do 

83
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:14,500
squats.
One time we went to seaworld and uh,

84
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,783
my daughter wanted,
this was before we knew it was bad and 

85
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,840
we just knew,
we just knew it was a lame place to go.

86
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:22,960
We didn't know it was evil.
And my daughter,

87
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,710
my oldest one was like a kid and like 
four or something.

88
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,620
She's like,
Dad,

89
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:28,454
can you pick me up?
And I had like that macho squat moment 

90
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:30,904
of yeah,
I'll put you up there and like hoisted 

91
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:37,480
her up right into a tree branch.
Oh no impact.

92
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,630
Knock Dong.
Oh No.

93
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,523
And then you feel so bad.
Like you want to blame somebody other 

94
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,070
than you and you're like,
well the,

95
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,540
the seaworld branch people assholes with
their tree placement.

96
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,450
Uh,
it was a rough one,

97
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,800
but no,
she always,

98
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:58,801
my daughter 11 still still has the 14 
year old is not asking be carried.

99
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:03,850
But the 11 year olds still have moments 
of Dan.

100
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,453
I don't think there's also this thing 
going on with kids where they're 

101
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,220
realizing like,
wow,

102
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,980
I'm going to be responsible for myself 
eventually.

103
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:13,870
This is coming.
This day is coming.

104
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,490
Yeah.
My tongue avoidable,

105
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,420
my daughter,
you know,

106
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,310
it's like,
it's like puberty time,

107
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,203
you know?
And she is so aware of it and she 

108
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,840
literally said out loud the other night,
I don't want to stop being a kid.

109
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,480
Whoa.
And I was like,

110
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,760
well look,
look at our friends,

111
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:32,920
cause we've all had a comedian friends.
I'm like,

112
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:34,790
look at Erin,
she's a grown up.

113
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,800
She's like,
yeah,

114
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,780
but she's different.
She's not.

115
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,381
I'm like,
yeah,

116
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:42,100
but she's hung on to being a nut and 
having a good time.

117
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:42,934
And I then I got kind of bummed out as I
was saying it because I want to say to 

118
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,011
her,
look,

119
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:48,844
I'm not that much of a grown up.
But to her it's like I'm a serious guy 

120
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:55,440
that's walking around scowling 
sometimes.

121
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,343
You know,
taking care of stuff that they wouldn't 

122
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,810
relieve her.
You know,

123
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,200
she sees me as a guy,
he's not having that much fun

124
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,393
the time.
Well don't you look at people that have 

125
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:11,170
incredible responsibilities like the 
president and you go fuck that job.

126
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,430
Oh my God.
Right?

127
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,293
Yeah.
Or Ceos of giant corporations are 

128
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,920
working 2030 hours a day or whatever the
fuck they're doing.

129
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,410
I think you just get in it and you can 
work 30 hours a day.

130
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,450
You just get in it and you'd go,
I guess.

131
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:24,284
But I guess,
but you look at them from an outsider's 

132
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:28,250
perspective and go,
that is just,

133
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,250
I don't want that.
I think a lot of times kids look at that

134
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,380
about adults like,
honey,

135
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:35,060
do you have your passport?
Where's your keys?

136
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,990
Where's it all right?
All right,

137
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:36,960
got my thing.
I got that.

138
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,971
They look at it like,
oh,

139
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,560
what's going on?
He's got so much to handle.

140
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,850
So much.
Did you lock the doors were going out.

141
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:44,660
Could you,
could you call the bill guy?

142
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:47,780
Did you make sure the payment and what 
about the plumber is,

143
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,330
is that fixed or can we turn the water 
on?

144
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:51,164
Is it the though

145
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,000
the thing that drives me crazy when I 
look at those guys,

146
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,020
the business guys and the president,
it's not this president so much cause he

147
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:01,660
seems pretty funny,
but is the,

148
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,950
they're so serious.
Yeah.

149
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,200
That's the one thing like is I don't 
take anything that serious around.

150
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,170
Even if people are screaming about 
whatever,

151
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,370
you know,
anything.

152
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,310
I just will make a joke.
I keep it light.

153
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,590
You know,
I'm not like clowning,

154
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,660
but I will,
you know,

155
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,243
there was,
there was a dead lizard this morning in 

156
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:24,454
the,
in the washing machine and my wife's 

157
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:29,120
screaming this,
I'm like,

158
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,860
could we keep them just to let the kids 
know?

159
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,210
And then they come back from these homes
when they have like play dates with,

160
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,780
with real grownup fathers and they're 
like,

161
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,763
nobody laughs

162
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,940
are there?
Oh,

163
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,760
I was like,
it's like really serious.

164
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,953
Well,
a lot of people's lives are like a 

165
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:50,070
sentence.
You have a daily eight hour sentence.

166
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,760
Your daily eight hours centers is to go 
to an office and do something you hate.

167
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,200
Yeah.
And then come home tired.

168
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,273
Yeah.
There's a Ted podcast that I was 

169
00:07:57,871 --> 00:07:59,460
listening to me,
uh,

170
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,730
come up with the name right here.
Maslow's human needs.

171
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,893
And uh,
I was listening to it on the way over 

172
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,020
here.
It's really fucking interesting.

173
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,420
Maslow,
the guy or is that a thing?

174
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,240
Um,
it's a good question.

175
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,050
I think it's the,
the guy who came up with these needs,

176
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:18,320
the hierarchy of needs.
Um,

177
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,820
yeah.
Human needs of food,

178
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,410
asleep,
safety,

179
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:23,490
love,
purpose.

180
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,710
A psychologist,
Abraham maslow.

181
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,450
And that's his,
um,

182
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,360
his hierarchy triangle,
like the food pyramid,

183
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:31,710
which by the way,
it's all fucked up.

184
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,544
The Food Pyramid.
Cause I was reading a story to my six 

185
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:36,441
year old,
uh,

186
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:38,580
about uh,
it was one of those um,

187
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,590
cat in the hat.
Like a,

188
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:42,150
the things you could do that are good 
for you.

189
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,470
All right.
And uh,

190
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,363
one of the things they show the feet 
food pyramid at the bottom is all bread 

191
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,060
bread's good.
What's not bread's good.

192
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,220
It's not good for you Tom.
Papa.

193
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:54,670
I know we started a

194
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,810
Oh you brought bread.
You son of a bitch.

195
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,630
It's,
oh it's wrapped in a cloth.

196
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:01,620
Ladies and gentlemen,
they're like,

197
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:04,620
like,
like he's some old timey baker character

198
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,280
through it feels like the only thing I'm
bummed out about us.

199
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,460
I didn't have a basket.
Did you make that I mainly made,

200
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,413
this is a sour dough.
This is a sourdough bread from Tom Papa 

201
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,830
that made it into New York Times.
Yeah.

202
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:20,760
When I did your show and a cat smell,
it talks about it.

203
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,940
And this is a couple of days old cause I
thought it was coming a couple days ago.

204
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,410
Yeah.

205
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,243
Ooh.
Did you even make the top a little 

206
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:28,980
flowery?
Like,

207
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,270
like a real bakery and misspelled?

208
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:31,970
Oh,

209
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,260
that's also good.
That's good.

210
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,520
God,
that smells good.

211
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,413
Yeah.

212
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,520
That's ancient sourdough.
Tom.

213
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:40,650
Papa,
you fucking Adam.

214
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,740
You brought a knife and everything.
I don't,

215
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,810
it looks like we're off the Diet today.
Today I was at the lowest weight.

216
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,350
I've been in like years one 90 this 
morning.

217
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,700
I really,
yeah,

218
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:53,050
it's crazy.
How tall are you?

219
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,010
Five.
Eight.

220
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,990
Wow.
I really,

221
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:57,140
uh,
I,

222
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,250
I don't think that this bread,
this is sourdough bread.

223
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:03,400
You digest it as a lower glycaemic 
supposedly.

224
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,130
Supposedly.
Allegedly.

225
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:06,971
I'm in though,
Dude.

226
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:08,550
Just slice it up.
Can I cut it on this?

227
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,280
This is a couple of days off.
So granted this table,

228
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:14,860
it actually be good.
Like it'll make it cooler.

229
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,320
So he just cut it like it's a cutting 
board.

230
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:18,310
Don't be shy.
All right.

231
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,743
This is a,
I mean this is how bread was made 

232
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,670
originally.
This is in ancient Egypt 6,000

233
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:26,020
years ago.
Ancient Egypt.

234
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:28,030
Do you know that in ancient Egypt when 
they made bread,

235
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:32,590
they ground their flour on like mortar 
and pestle.

236
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,420
But they were really shitty and so 
they'd get a lot of sand in the flower.

237
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,630
So the people in ancient Egypt all had 
fucked up teeth,

238
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:45,631
like worn down to the nerves cause they 
were chewing sand all day.

239
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,420
So the inside of their body was like a 
fucking,

240
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:51,790
what are those things called on birds?
What is that called?

241
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,290
Like a,
um,

242
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,820
like uh,
what is that thing?

243
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,280
That thing that they do?
The crop where you,

244
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,930
you have your,
your gizzard.

245
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,803
Yeah.
We both fucking rocks in there and you 

246
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:06,640
chew up your Food God,
which is apparently,

247
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,860
um,
one of the reasons why they made,

248
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,400
um,
led shot illegal in California.

249
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:13,234
Cause like if people do like shooting 
clays or if they shoot things and those 

250
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:19,590
little lead pellets from shotguns,
right.

251
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,640
Birds will actually eat those.
Oh.

252
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,870
And it goes in there.
They're gizzard and they use it to,

253
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:27,940
uh,
to grind things up,

254
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:28,774
but then they get lead poisoning.
That's the thing with the California 

255
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:31,900
condor.
Oh really?

256
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,300
Yeah.
That's one of the reasons why California

257
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:35,890
condors,
um,

258
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,390
one of the reasons why they made led 
illegal for a ammunition in California.

259
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,380
It was because of California condors 
cause they wouldn't hear it dump fucks.

260
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,580
So,
um,

261
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,860
eating pellets,
this,

262
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,030
you know,
that's not a rock.

263
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:51,040
You stupid fuck condor.
They look dumb.

264
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,540
They have dominance fought.
They really do it.

265
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,400
But we need this should be toasted.

266
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,580
I mean toasted would really be the thing
that would get you to tie right now.

267
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:58,414
Folks.
Here we go.

268
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,760
Oh,
I'm so happy to see you eat bread.

269
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,980
Oh this has a good,
it's pretty good.

270
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:10,720
I was a nice and airy.
I make the,

271
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:12,910
I we haven't bought bread since I 
started this.

272
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,950
How long ago was that?
December.

273
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,170
Wow.
We have not bought bread.

274
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,450
Do you know what like bread in,
uh,

275
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,590
in your supermarket,
this is made with three ingredients.

276
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,090
Flour,
water and salt.

277
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,330
That's it.
That's,

278
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,440
you know,
from your sourdough starter bread,

279
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:31,330
like the healthy,
like whole wheat bread,

280
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:32,770
you just get it.
Ralph's or whatever.

281
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,430
32 ingredients.
32.

282
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,833
This is pure.
And is that just because it's preserved 

283
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,830
preservatives and flavors?
And young people could show mad when you

284
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,570
eat on a microphone.
I know,

285
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:48,880
but it's so good.
Normally folks,

286
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:49,714
I would never do this to you and I'm 
only doing this to you because Tom Papa 

287
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,720
brought some bread in and I'm gonna 
break my diet for a few hours.

288
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,620
The sour dough flavor,
like that little after flavor in the top

289
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:00,454
of your mouth.
It's an that's a bacteria that's 

290
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,530
lactobacillius or something like that.
Yeah.

291
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,470
Dude,
this is really good.

292
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,950
You're in a excellent bread guy.
It's pretty cool.

293
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,450
Standup comedy thing doesn't pan out.
Dude.

294
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,973
I'm going to just go into it after doing
your podcast and then talking about it 

295
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,610
on my podcast,
it just kind of erupted.

296
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:21,990
People were just so interested in just 
this pure earth,

297
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,460
making something small and simple.
And,

298
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,520
and uh,
I think I told you when I saw you at the

299
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:29,020
comedy store,
there's like,

300
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:29,854
you know,
you have some,

301
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,783
you have some real man listeners,
like dudes who look like they're going 

302
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:37,720
to call you for like advice on a truck 
and they're like,

303
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,850
I can't get my starter right.
It's like there's some like,

304
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,980
and people would start sending me 
pictures of,

305
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:47,800
there's bread and pictures of their 
sourdough and then this guy from the New

306
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,300
York Times,
Sam sift in the editor,

307
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,220
it was doing an article on it.

308
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,730
So he contacted me and I was part of 
this sour dough.

309
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,200
This whole thing about people keep their
sourdough starter like a pet.

310
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,160
So it was kind of like this revival of 
this little method.

311
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,340
So I ended up in this article in the New
York Times.

312
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,403
Yeah,
I read it.

313
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,100
I had a lot of people send me articles 
about starters to yeah,

314
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:12,934
like people in England than have 150 
year old starters and all this crazy 

315
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:16,534
shit weird.
It's so good that I'd never even heard 

316
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,370
about until you brought it up.
I have no idea.

317
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,090
I had no idea either until a month 
before that I had the,

318
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,510
I was under the impression I,
it was with zero research,

319
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,940
just my head.
This is how you make bread.

320
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,690
I thought you'd take flour and water and
eggs and yeast.

321
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:35,763
Yeah.
You add used poor Euston and that's all 

322
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:37,841
I thought.
I didn't,

323
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:38,674
I never knew that you had like did you 
take flour and mix it with water and 

324
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:45,760
then you get east out of the air?
Yeah.

325
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,340
When you told me that and I was like,
yeah,

326
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:49,150
get the fuck out here.
That's crazy.

327
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:52,100
Just floating around this all the time,
but did you know that that's what the

328
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,380
case with nitrogen?
Yeah,

329
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:57,200
like the reason why there's so many 
people on this planet,

330
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,910
and this is from a radio lab podcast 
that highlighted,

331
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,160
I think it was called the bad show,
but the,

332
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:06,994
the radiolab podcast was highlighting 
how sometimes really bad people do 

333
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:12,464
really good things or really good.
It's sometimes it's difficult to 

334
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,793
differentiate between someone who's bad 
or good because what they've done is so 

335
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:19,520
amazing.
Right.

336
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,383
Well,
this is a guy named Fritz harbor and 

337
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:27,551
Fritz Haber was a scientist in Germany 
and what harbor did was he figured out a

338
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:28,574
way to extract nitrogen from the air 
because apparently our air is mostly 

339
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:36,290
nitrogen.
It's a massive part of what's in the air

340
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,400
is nitrogen.
Okay.

341
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,500
I don't know what percentage young 
Jamie,

342
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,790
what percentage?
Jamie.

343
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,550
Jamie,
please put percentage of the oxygen.

344
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,320
You're like the five year old 
surrounding the five year old.

345
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,000
No,
no.

346
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,260
Like I want to know how much nitrogen is
in the air.

347
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,080
Amy,
what does it say?

348
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,120
20% okay,
so okay,

349
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,620
by all by volume.
Dry Air contains 78% nitrogen,

350
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,930
20% oxygen.
Wow.

351
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:03,764
78% nitrogen.
So the air is mostly nitrogen and we 

352
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:11,690
need nitrogen for fertilizer.
So Fritz harbor came up with this method

353
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:12,524
called the hopper method of extracting 
nitrogen from air and that is what we 

354
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:17,954
use primarily for fertilizer.
It's a big part of what we need to make 

355
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:25,820
sure that the ground is viable for 
growing food.

356
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,000
While the harbor method is responsible 
for the nitrogen,

357
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:29,834
apparently that's in 50% of the people 
on the planet extracted directly from 

358
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:35,870
the harbor method.
What do you mean in the people?

359
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,093
The pee,
the nitrogen from from say if you grow 

360
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:44,450
plants right and you eat those plants,
the nitrogen that gets in your body from

361
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:45,284
those plants,
50% of it is coming from this one guy's 

362
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:52,130
method that he invented in world war one
crazy.

363
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,510
It is crazy.
Crazy.

364
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,290
So what was in us in the 18 hundreds 
fertilizer from fish,

365
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,390
things like that,
like you,

366
00:16:58,391 --> 00:16:59,224
you'd have to get mulch and compost.
And that's how a lot of people do it 

367
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:05,630
today with organic farming they use,
right?

368
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,410
Like at my house,
we take our chicken eggs and,

369
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:13,411
and things that we don't eat and it goes
into this pile with leaves and Oh yeah,

370
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,680
yeah.
You have to compost is tricky.

371
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,160
Like,
yeah,

372
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,993
it's,
you have to kind of create an 

373
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:20,930
environment for bacteria and stuff to 
grow.

374
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:24,800
And when plants eat,
they don't just eat water.

375
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,300
Right.
It's not just photosynthesis,

376
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:30,200
but they also need nutrients from the 
soil and they get their nutrients in the

377
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:34,110
soil from dead things from decaying 
bodies for right.

378
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,123
You know,
from worms and bugs and all kinds of 

379
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:39,800
shit.
Well this guy,

380
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:40,634
Fritz Haber,
figured out how to get the nitrogen in 

381
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:43,540
order to fertilize the ground.

382
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,540
He just getting it out of the air.
But he also created Zyklon b client a,

383
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:51,204
and b,
the shit that they used to kill a Jews 

384
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:56,640
in the concentration camps that kind of 
created that.

385
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,980
But he actually did the eval name,
you know,

386
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:02,040
that's bad shit.
As soon as they say as I close icon,

387
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,590
that's why I say it right as I call him.
Um,

388
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:09,591
so he came up with Xy clon a in Zyklon a
was this gas,

389
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:15,800
but there was a scent attached to it so 
that you could smell it right.

390
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,970
So that you could know it's dangerous.
Get the fuck deafness.

391
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,270
The Nazis switched it to Zyklon b.
They took out that smell and that's what

392
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,580
they used to gas people in the 
concentration camps.

393
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,190
So Fritz Haber,
who by the way was a Jew,

394
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,840
his harbor method created this horrible 
thing.

395
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,823
He also was one of the first people to 
institute some form of chemical warfare 

396
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,140
in world war one.

397
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,243
They would use the same method that he 
used to extract nitrogen from the 

398
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,140
oxygen.
Somehow or another,

399
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:53,520
he utilize that method to bomb allied 
troops with poison gas.

400
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,943
Oh my God.
It was apparently he was a fucking 

401
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:57,410
maniac.
Yeah.

402
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,253
And it was directly his idea.
Not only was it directly his idea to 

403
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,690
bomb the allies,
but he was like super excited about it.

404
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:04,524
Like,
really?

405
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,250
Yeah,
it's,

406
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,180
he just,
yeah,

407
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:09,990
he just had this power knowledge and 
went right to evil.

408
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,883
Well,
sort of because he thought he was doing 

409
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:14,160
good because he was doing it for 
Germany,

410
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,570
you know?
Right.

411
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,600
But then he was eventually,
when Hitler rose to power,

412
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,570
he was fucked because he was Jewish.
So because he was Jewish,

413
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,860
um,
you know,

414
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:27,510
he didn't,
he,

415
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,730
because he was so valuable as a 
scientist,

416
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:30,564
they didn't immediately lock him up,
but he was in this weird position where 

417
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:33,984
he had to take a stand and you know,
like what he was responsible for doing 

418
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,310
ultimately went on to kill,
you know,

419
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,200
untold millions of people.

420
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,540
Did he survive?
Did they know I'm alive now?

421
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,650
He died.
He died,

422
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,670
uh,
seeking,

423
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,210
I think it was,
um,

424
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,940
some sort of health care in Switzerland 
or something like that.

425
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:56,280
I think he had like a bad heart really 
when he died,

426
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,114
trying to make it there because he was 
sort of exiled by country and they 

427
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:01,500
wouldn't take him in England because of 
the,

428
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,210
his,
he was wanted at the same time,

429
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:05,850
he's received a Nobel prize for creating
the hopper method.

430
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,070
He was wanted for crimes against 
humanity.

431
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:12,510
It was wanted as a war criminal for 
using this gas on the allied troops.

432
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,550
She's so,
it's so complicated.

433
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:15,384
So in one on one hand he was responsible
for the death of all these people and 

434
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:19,470
it's horrible,
horrible way.

435
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,633
But on the other hand,
the hopper method again is responsible 

436
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:23,424
for like literally they believe that the
populates population boom is directly 

437
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,820
attributable to his invention.
Amazing.

438
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,400
It's just a side thing.
What is the,

439
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,443
at what point did it become a war crime 
to use gas if I think nobody had ever 

440
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:38,214
done it before.
So they just saw how bad it wasn't 

441
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:43,470
immediately it was like this is,
I guess this is a,

442
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,690
well the idea of a war crime is very 
strange.

443
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,100
It's tricky because when

444
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,933
you said like,
well he thought he was doing a good 

445
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:50,824
thing cause it's his country that he is 
protecting and it hadn't been done 

446
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:54,064
before that you people were using gas.
So it's like why would that be a crime 

447
00:20:58,151 --> 00:20:58,984
at that time?
Well what's a war crime and what isn't 

448
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:03,040
right.
Like is dropping a bomb?

449
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,350
Is that a war cry was drop a bomb on a 
city,

450
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,490
hydrogen,
nuclear,

451
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:07,510
whatever you want to do.
I mean,

452
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:08,344
isn't it a war crime?
If you indiscriminately kill people 

453
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,860
happen to be in the area that you're 
bombing,

454
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,960
what's the crime like?
Yeah,

455
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,420
you're supposed to killing.
That's Tom.

456
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:19,480
Papa is still,
this is the problem.

457
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,490
It's of you.
That's what the problem is,

458
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,410
right?
That the chip grabbed that bitch up.

459
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:24,244
So we don't keep doing this because 
otherwise people will tolerate like a 

460
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:28,630
session of a podcast and chewing.

461
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,760
You're chewing brown.
But if we keep going,

462
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,450
that'd be fucking pissed.
Adam Cro will get more viewers.

463
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,680
I'm glad that you,
uh,

464
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,250
that you ate it though.
I know.

465
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,093
I knew.
I knew it'd be concerned about the 

466
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:40,060
bread.
Well,

467
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:42,220
I hit a milestone this morning.
One 90.

468
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,990
That's huge.
That's great.

469
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,660
I've lost more than 10 pounds in a since
when,

470
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,280
um,
how long has it been?

471
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:50,080
Like five or six months,
something like that.

472
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,460
Five months.
Five months.

473
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,920
Just go real clean.
Well,

474
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,950
I cut all the bullshit out and I started
eating a high fat diet,

475
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,540
a high healthy fats like Avocados,
coconut oil,

476
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,680
right.
Things along those lines and um,

477
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,200
I just cut out bread,
sugar,

478
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,570
all that stuff.
No car.

479
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,870
Well,
very little.

480
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,660
I get most of my carbs from vegetables,
but man,

481
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,790
I tell you like as far as like 
physically,

482
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,620
like my energy level,
it's amazing.

483
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,640
I feel so good.
Oh,

484
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,050
I've never felt better.
Really?

485
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,000
That's incredible.
I want to try this.

486
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,760
I think a,
we just get used to feeling like shit.

487
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,210
It's really true.
You know?

488
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,200
It's totally true.
You just get used to it.

489
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,060
You get used to like people were hung 
over.

490
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,043
Yeah.
You just kind of like in this fog and 

491
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:37,810
you just like,
that's just how I am.

492
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,200
Think it's bad diet or booze or 
whatever.

493
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,540
What about the GCL Kimmel lust is,
wait,

494
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,000
how did he do it?
That fasting thing,

495
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:47,440
that five,
five,

496
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:49,420
two diet,
five,

497
00:22:49,421 --> 00:22:51,190
two diet.
It's five days.

498
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:54,040
He just eats whatever,
like a crazy person.

499
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:58,960
And then two days he eats under 500 
calories and he tributes.

500
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,020
He says he's been doing it for years and
this is why he's slim.

501
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:04,130
You know,
he's a lot slimmer than you used to base

502
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,710
to be.

503
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,441
And uh,
yeah,

504
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:08,650
two days don't eat like 500 calories.
It's not,

505
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,620
you know,
it's like pickles and coffee and then,

506
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:12,454
uh,
and then the rest of the days he just 

507
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:17,560
eats whatever he wants to eat.
I can't be good for your body.

508
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:18,850
Right.
I don't know.

509
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,720
I'm just too stupid for this.
I don't know.

510
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,200
I do the minimal amount of research on 
almost everything.

511
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,410
You seem so knowledgeable about it 
though when I seemed knowledgeable about

512
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:30,430
a few things.
It's true.

513
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:32,170
Whenever I have these kind of questions 
like Gel,

514
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:33,004
now I know a few things,
but if you let go into depth with me 

515
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,830
about them and you find out how shallow 
my knowledge true.

516
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,710
You know,
I was watching uh,

517
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,043
uh,
this woman came to my show in San 

518
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,830
Francisco this weekend.
A doctor Rhonda Patrick.

519
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,120
Yeah.
You met her.

520
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,340
She now,
she hit me on twitter after she had been

521
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:56,320
at the show and was thanking me for 
being so hilarious and uh,

522
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,990
I saw she had a lot of twitter followers
so I just looked her up and uh,

523
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,940
saw her on your show and she was really 
interesting and she's like,

524
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:05,774
uh,
you know,

525
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,703
super smart about all this stuff and 
just goes the facts just pouring out of 

526
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:10,400
her.

527
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,830
But uh,
whether you're acting or not,

528
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,310
it,
you,

529
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,830
you looked like you knew what you're 
doing acting.

530
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,370
But it's a perfect example because in 
comparison to her,

531
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,360
I'm an idiot.
Well,

532
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,530
yeah,
but she was off the charts,

533
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,290
but that's how I look at it.
Right.

534
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,900
Paired right person.
Yeah.

535
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,420
I can tell you what ketosis is and I can
tell you why.

536
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:35,450
It's better to have your body burn fat 
allegedly.

537
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,250
Right.
Although people disagree with it.

538
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,860
This is stuff like,
right.

539
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,720
Bobby Lee doesn't know this stuff.
You Bobby Lane,

540
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,290
he has a beautiful body.
Do you think so?

541
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,370
Everybody's into different shit.
Like a scallop those old,

542
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,373
like a scallop.
It looks like a scout challenged with 

543
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,230
legs.
I remember those old days.

544
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,610
That was like a hot look what being 
levee.

545
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,330
Yeah,
those like Victorian days.

546
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,643
People would just lie around and just 
look like a lard ass and everybody was 

547
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:03,794
like,
aw,

548
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,670
it meant wealth.

549
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,790
I know that guy.
I can afford food and not amazing.

550
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,813
Yeah,
that was because back then it was 

551
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:10,904
probably difficult to get that fat too 
cause they weren't eating processed 

552
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:15,254
foods like rice,
all this stuff that we today like candy 

553
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:20,060
bars and shit like that.
Coca Cola,

554
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,350
it just right to fat.
Immediate.

555
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,520
So like back then if you were going to 
get that fat,

556
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:29,630
like I always picture whenever I picture
Reuben NASC I picture somehow or another

557
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:31,820
a picture of them naked on a couch.
Right.

558
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,160
Do you like,
do you have like,

559
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,933
like when you think of like overweight 
people from that part time I was 

560
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,690
pictures,
I'm like lounging naked food around just

561
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:43,340
fat as fuck.
Yeah,

562
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,980
exactly.
You had to eat a lot of food back then.

563
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,240
A lot.
But you know,

564
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:50,420
isn't it probably until like the last 40
years.

565
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:54,230
Because like when you look at movies,
even like in the 60s,

566
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,020
everybody,
either the extras,

567
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,190
the stars beyond the stars,
just the people and they're all thin.

568
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,473
They're all thin.
They're just not the puffiness that we 

569
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:06,404
all have now.
There's a puffiness that comes because 

570
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:12,710
we're trying to eat this bread.
We think it's whole wheat bread from the

571
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:14,870
store and it's got sugar.
It's got fruit,

572
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:17,540
it's got stuff in it that's puffing us 
up.

573
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:21,350
That didn't exist even in the sixties 
and seventies a big part is corn syrup.

574
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,360
Did you ever see king corn?
Yeah,

575
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,760
no.
It's amazing.

576
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,100
It's a crazy documentary with these 
guys.

577
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:30,970
They're students and they,
um,

578
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,903
they,
they go and they get their body examine 

579
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,000
and they examine the doctor who does the
tests on them,

580
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:38,834
examines their carbon and their body and
finds out that most of it comes from 

581
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:43,980
corn.
And they were

582
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,700
like,
what?

583
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,840
Like,
what in the fuck is that?

584
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:46,674
So it sends them on this journey where 
they start examining the role that corn 

585
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:54,210
plays in our diet and food.
And they ultimately went and,

586
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,203
um,
they got their own farmland and started 

587
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:57,234
growing some corn,
but they go into the whole process of 

588
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:00,714
corn,
how corn is subsidized by the u s 

589
00:27:03,061 --> 00:27:07,350
government and how much corn is in 
different products that we eat.

590
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,563
So these guys go to the supermarket and 
they walked down the aisle and just 

591
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:14,430
randomly start grabbing stuff and find 
out this says corn protein.

592
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:17,520
This has corn syrup that says this and 
that and that and this.

593
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,250
And fucking,
they use corn for everything every then,

594
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,280
and even the,
even the meat is all corn fed animals.

595
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,860
Yes.
And that's why they're so fat and the,

596
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,610
and they shouldn't be eating corn.
Exactly.

597
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,340
Well then when you,
when you have steak and it's corn fed,

598
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,180
that big thick layer of fat and the 
marbling,

599
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:34,420
which we call marbling.
Yeah.

600
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,340
That's like the cow dying.
I think that's a cow being a fat fuck.

601
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,170
And you're like,
yeah,

602
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,230
I know.
The tasty pie.

603
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,570
That's evil.
Yeah.

604
00:27:45,571 --> 00:27:46,404
It's,
it's,

605
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,610
but it's,
it's weird.

606
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,470
Yeah.
It's weird that we liked,

607
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,190
I mean,
I mean,

608
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,680
tastes good though.
God Damn it.

609
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,530
But to think that you,
I know a fatty piece of meat,

610
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:00,060
I know a fat thick Ribeye,
it's well marbled,

611
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,550
uh,
go lord.

612
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,870
Why is it so good if it's bad for you?
So good.

613
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,790
Why the good things bad for you tom 
pile?

614
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,080
I don't know.
It's because of the,

615
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,710
you God wants you to come see him and 
heaven is that whole sweetie.

616
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,460
That's awesome.
My,

617
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,150
my new movement is to,
uh,

618
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,190
try and not eat factory farmed meat and 
uh,

619
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,490
which basically means you're not eating 
meat most of the time.

620
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,600
Like you can't eat it when you're out.
You can't eat Pepperoni Pizza,

621
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,950
candy.
You know what I mean?

622
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:32,640
Like if you really want to try and know 
exactly where your meat is coming from,

623
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:37,641
you're basically cutting a ton of meat 
out of your diet because you,

624
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,370
you can for home use,
go to a farmer's market,

625
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,400
pick up,
you know,

626
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,040
beef that is grown by,
you know,

627
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,610
raised it by this local cattle hand.
But,

628
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:48,444
uh,
just to go out in the world on the road 

629
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:50,844
and just be like,
I'm only going to eat me where I know 

630
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:55,230
where it's come from.
Look at a room service menu.

631
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,790
Yeah.
That's not going to happen.

632
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:57,950
You'd have to go to

633
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:01,460
a restaurant where you knew what the 
farm was that they'd got it from,

634
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:02,900
which she,
there's a lot of those now.

635
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:03,751
Yeah.
I mean,

636
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:04,620
yeah.
I mean you,

637
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,783
you know,
you go to these places now and they say 

638
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:09,610
farm raised and farm to table places.
Yeah.

639
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,460
There's a lot more.
And cities,

640
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:14,220
I'd never had it either.
Like you gotta like Cleveland,

641
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:16,920
which was the Tory is for like,
you know,

642
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,840
not giving a shit about their diet and 
now is a lot of them.

643
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,020
This is like that.
Yeah.

644
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:26,370
Well I think the Internet has sort of 
expanded people's idea of what food is.

645
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,233
And I think a lot of chefs who really 
enjoy food but don't really enjoy this 

646
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:34,120
whole idea of factory farming and 
they're trying to figure out what,

647
00:29:34,121 --> 00:29:37,470
what this gotta be on a more wholesome 
approach to getting your food.

648
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,673
And so they make relationships with 
these farmers and then they buy their 

649
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:45,010
food directly from them.
There's this one place in Maine that was

650
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:48,880
on a Anthony Bourdain's show,
I think it was on his early show,

651
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:52,300
the no reservation show.
And these people in Maine,

652
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,150
they do everything and it's a short,
they don't,

653
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,920
they're not open in the winter cause you
know,

654
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:58,630
winters in Maine are just brutal.
Right.

655
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,690
So they're closed in the winter,
but during the summer,

656
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:02,524
Spring and fall,
they have everything on the menu is 

657
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:08,560
vegetables a day grow.

658
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,773
Um,
and then they butchered their own 

659
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,520
animals.
They raised their own animals.

660
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,413
Right.
That was really weird because like they 

661
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:15,014
were petting this pig.
They had the pig and they were petting 

662
00:30:17,071 --> 00:30:17,550
him.
Yeah.

663
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,970
They were talking about how,
you know,

664
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,690
after you kill a couple of them,
you start looking at them like,

665
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,171
oh,
these are,

666
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:25,090
this is a nice ham hock here.
This is,

667
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:26,680
the Bacon's going to be good off of this
one.

668
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,920
That's a little,
yeah,

669
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,110
it's dark because you're,
it's your direct connect it to it.

670
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:32,944
You don't have that.
You don't have that like a middleman 

671
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,543
that gives you a nice filter,
so you don't have to think about the 

672
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:40,930
morality behind that little piggy.

673
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,953
I know,
but it seems like those people are able 

674
00:30:44,421 --> 00:30:46,700
to do it like it is kind of a natural 
thing.

675
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,110
Well,
it's natural for farmers.

676
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,610
You know?
If you talked to farmers,

677
00:30:49,611 --> 00:30:51,290
they get used to it.
Yeah.

678
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,320
You get used to this idea that you know,
you have these things,

679
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:55,270
you're raising me.
Love Him.

680
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,330
Then you shoot him in the head and eat 
them.

681
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,220
Yeah,
exactly.

682
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,323
And look,
you're not going to get rid of factory 

683
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:04,480
farming.
There's so many people that are eating.

684
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,010
It's,
it's going to exist,

685
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:09,100
but I just feel like maybe I don't have 
to participate in it.

686
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,100
Is it always going to exist?
I think so.

687
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:12,963
Yeah.
Yeah.

688
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,270
Well,
it's reading and it's getting stronger.

689
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:17,104
I mean,
factory farming is now ending up in 

690
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:23,380
places that never had a meat based diet 
sending up all throughout Asia.

691
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,120
Yeah.
It's spreading.

692
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:28,870
It's not getting smaller,
but that's just because it's profitable.

693
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:30,400
Right.
If people just out

694
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,530
people jump in and say,
enough of that,

695
00:31:32,531 --> 00:31:33,760
I can't do this anymore.
Right.

696
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,590
And the demand drops,
right.

697
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,350
We got to do is I've got to give 
everyone in America all that money.

698
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:40,630
So they get that $179,000.
Right?

699
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,060
Yeah.
They could afford that sweet,

700
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:48,061
sweet farm raised protein hay back to,
uh,

701
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,020
back to the,
um,

702
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,420
the science guy that,
uh,

703
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,050
made the Xy clon yeah.
Be Spring Harbor.

704
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,970
Harbor Harbor.
So that's like an evil,

705
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,530
like that's a guy that has like a lot 
of,

706
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,053
a lot of good in his mind,
but then it becomes like this evil kind 

707
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:09,430
of a thing.
But you know,

708
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:12,300
there's,
you were asking what like,

709
00:32:12,301 --> 00:32:13,840
what's a,
what's a war crime?

710
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,420
You know,
it's kind of fuzzy.

711
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:19,450
It depends on what side you're on and 
how you're living,

712
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:20,284
you know?
And you could say the same thing about 

713
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:21,963
being a terrorist.
I mean we see someone as being a 

714
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:26,500
terrorist as being something evil and 
awful,

715
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,320
but I'm sure like if you talk to a 
family,

716
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,933
18 year old kid is like,
you don't understand how my family is 

717
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:33,964
suffering in the middle of this desert 
and we're being tortured by these 

718
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,260
governments that came in and raped our 
land.

719
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,100
He could make a case that would make you
think,

720
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,490
well you blowing up something is not 
really a war crime.

721
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:44,324
It's you fighting for your survival.
Sounds like Tom pops a terrorist 

722
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:48,230
sympathizer.
No.

723
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,573
Two things about Tom.
Bobby likes bread and terror and I love 

724
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:54,860
terrorism.
Yeah,

725
00:32:54,861 --> 00:32:56,750
I know what you're saying is that fuzzy 
thing.

726
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,290
Someone had asked me that question in 
regards to like the uh,

727
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,730
our own revolution.
Like when we started fighting outside of

728
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:05,564
the lines and hiding in trees and doing 
some crazy kind of fighting and we 

729
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,700
weren't in those lines anymore.
I was like,

730
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:12,230
these guys are rebels.
These guys are,

731
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,630
we're chairs.
Yeah,

732
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,520
you're cheating.
But I think it,

733
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,170
you could probably dig back to the root 
of it and be like,

734
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:20,390
well you're hurting innocent people or 
whatever it is.

735
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:24,590
There probably is a line we can say this
is a war crime.

736
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,760
Well what's interesting is at one point 
in time war was handled in a gentlemanly

737
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:29,570
way,
right?

738
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,403
Like the leaders of one army would meet 
with the leaders of the other and the 

739
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:36,344
general would actually hand his sword 
over to the other general and they 

740
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,023
either take it or occasionally in a 
gesture of good faith it would give the 

741
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:48,050
sword back to him except except defeat 
or except victory.

742
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,243
And um,
they handled war by these like very 

743
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:54,560
strict codes at that,
at least at the highest levels.

744
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,680
And then somewhere along the line we 
figured that we don't,

745
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,170
I think that was because it was like 
super intimate,

746
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,160
like for war back then you had to kind 
of be on top of each other.

747
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,920
You know,
you had to be like stabbing each other,

748
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,783
right.
Are shooting each other with arrows at 

749
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:11,840
the very low and it's not that far away.
25 yards,

750
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:16,130
you're dealing with like much shorter 
distances and then once they figured out

751
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:17,900
bombs,
like I don't even know where this bomb's

752
00:34:17,901 --> 00:34:19,370
going,
but fuck those people.

753
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,093
Right,
exactly.

754
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,690
Where's the general?
I'm dropping this on to him.

755
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:29,510
I mean his sword isn't World War II.
The ultimate example of that,

756
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,373
I mean World War II,
when they drop those bombs and Nagasaki 

757
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:37,460
and Hiroshima bombs are,
that's the ultimate,

758
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,230
I don't even know what's going to happen
down there.

759
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:40,840
I'm just going to let this motherfucker 
drop this.

760
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,043
Right.
They never dropped a bomb in a city 

761
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:43,790
before.
Right.

762
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,200
And this is the first time they dropped 
me.

763
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,290
It only happened twice ever.
But those two nuclear bombs,

764
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,390
it dropped in those cities.
They literally were like,

765
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,100
whoever the fuck's down there.
Yup.

766
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,810
Tough Shit.
So long babies.

767
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,430
Yeah,
we're going to end this.

768
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,350
Yeah.
You drop a bomb on a city for sure.

769
00:34:57,351 --> 00:34:58,880
You're killing babies.
Oh yeah,

770
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,950
a hundred percent babies.
Puppies.

771
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,010
Oh ladies.
Coleslaw.

772
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,973
Yeah.
GRANDPA and grandma might be kissing 

773
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,020
right in the,
in the kitchen.

774
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:11,021
What a wonderful life we've had.
What the yeah.

775
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,320
Oh,
where's as being like the guy who's just

776
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,930
outside of the area that gets affected.
You know,

777
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:22,280
the guy who's has doesn't get touched 
the just a mile outside of it,

778
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,230
who's just like,
oh my God.

779
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:28,170
Well there was one guy who escaped 
Hiroshima and went to Nagasaki and then,

780
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,420
and he got blown up and Nagasaki to that
motherfucker must have thought the world

781
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:38,280
was ending old bad luck Jones,
this bullshit

782
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,020
ass war.
I don't even know nothing to do.

783
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,560
I'm out here making Sushi surrender 
already.

784
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,820
I'm trying to read Samurai books.
Fucking dude's to drop a nuclear bomb.

785
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,840
There was,
there was a,

786
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,450
I saw Adrian Brody had a cool,
I thought it was a cool quote on a woody

787
00:35:55,451 --> 00:35:56,284
Allen yesterday,
just back to the thing and be like good 

788
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:00,670
and evil.
Whether this guy was,

789
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,300
was a good person or a bad person and we
were asking him about Woody Allen.

790
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,250
He's like,
you know,

791
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,180
it's just,
it's a complicated thing being a,

792
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,280
being a person.
It's a complicated,

793
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:17,550
messy affair and he's an artist and I 
like his films and he's,

794
00:36:17,651 --> 00:36:18,484
you know,
it would be irresponsible of me to 

795
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,550
assume I know something of which I know 
very little.

796
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,100
I don't know what's going on in a man's 
life,

797
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,690
let alone his sexual life,
let alone you know,

798
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,143
to assume that you know these things as 
and treat them as truth when they 

799
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:37,420
haven't even been proven true.
It's just a difficult thing.

800
00:36:37,421 --> 00:36:40,270
The thing I latched on to is it's just 
such a mess.

801
00:36:40,271 --> 00:36:42,190
Being a person.
It is a mess.

802
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:46,990
So complicated and especially a person 
that's been around for years,

803
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:47,621
like if you're,
you know,

804
00:36:47,621 --> 00:36:51,640
you're seven years old,
you've been around trying to be a person

805
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,130
for a long,
long,

806
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:55,210
long,
long time,

807
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,103
you are going to make mistakes.
You are going to be at the very least a 

808
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:02,420
mess.
You know what I mean?

809
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,670
Woody Allen though,
where you're standing,

810
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,920
like when you stand against him.
Yeah.

811
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:09,754
You're not just standing against a human
being who may or may not have done some 

812
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:13,384
fucked up things,
but you're also standing against the 

813
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:19,780
idea of people doing the things that he 
is alleged to have done.

814
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,810
Like sexual abuse of minors.
Right.

815
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,733
Well you know,
because that's one of the things that 

816
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:29,701
his daughter and her brother are 
alleging that he did like his,

817
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,000
his son wrote an article about him.
You know that right?

818
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:38,470
Ronan Farrow who's really Sinatra's son.
Yes.

819
00:37:38,471 --> 00:37:41,250
He's obviously Sinatra's man.
He looks just like,

820
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,490
oh sorry.
I said no,

821
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
it's really smart guy.
So first of all,

822
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,240
Mia Farrow was a whore.
Right.

823
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,250
Cause you say that.
Fair to say that.

824
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,760
Very promiscuous.
Well she just liked the dick and Sinatra

825
00:37:51,761 --> 00:37:53,560
probably slang,
some good dick.

826
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,220
It's must be weird for woody,
like growing up,

827
00:37:57,221 --> 00:38:00,280
he must've been like,
that is not my fucking kid.

828
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,530
Yeah.
Do you think he ever got a DNA test?

829
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:03,080
I mean,
Jeez,

830
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,410
now a lot back.
Then look at that.

831
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,330
That's me a foul and Sinatra's baby.
100% yeah.

832
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,100
There's no woody and Ronan at all.

833
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,170
Did Woody Allen say that?
He looks a lot like Sinatra?

834
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,000
I've never heard them comment on it.
Well,

835
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:21,180
it says it right there.
What's it say right there?

836
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:25,350
Woody Allen says Ronan Farrow looks a 
lot like Frank Sinatra.

837
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:30,750
Chia thing,
I mean has been a clear example.

838
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,340
Those eyes,
the Blue Eyes.

839
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,080
Oh my God.
Look at this blue eyes,

840
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:35,710
but his face,
everything about him.

841
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,573
[inaudible]

842
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,683
Lips.
Even the crease look a on the left hand 

843
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:40,360
side.
Our left.

844
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,030
Why the fuck hasn't he gotten a bug?
A DNA test?

845
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,280
I don't know.
I'd be like,

846
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,560
that kid needs to shut the fuck up and 
get rid of my name.

847
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,560
Yeah,
well it's actually farrow.

848
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,940
Ronan.
Ronan Farrow.

849
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:53,530
Yeah,
so it's not really a son,

850
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,720
but I guess he probably raised him as 
his son.

851
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,090
Is that the deal?
I guess he was around cheese.

852
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,953
He's 78 wow.
Addressed ex girlfriend mia farrow's 

853
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,210
claimed their son Rowan and may actually
be her ex husband.

854
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,044
Frank Sinatra's child may be.
I pause for a quick word on the Rowan 

855
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,900
situation.
Alan wrote in the middle of his response

856
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:11,734
to Dylan Pharaohs detailed New York 
Times open letter accusing him of 

857
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:15,880
sexually abusing her.
Um,

858
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,360
is he my son or as Mya suggest,
Frank Sinatra's,

859
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,110
granted he looks a lot like frank with 
the blue eyes and the facial features.

860
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,840
But if so,
what does that say?

861
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,033
That all during the custody hearing me 
lied under oath and bulking is just 

862
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,440
fucking so that means while she was with
woody,

863
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:33,590
she,
after being with friends,

864
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,493
going with woody,
who she drifted back to Frank 

865
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,170
[inaudible],
she got some Dick.

866
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,930
I'm a slut though.
World on a string.

867
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,320
Yeah,
for sure.

868
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,340
For sure.
By the way.

869
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,630
Me and Pharaoh actress.
Okay.

870
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,260
Most likely crazy.
Like good luck finding an,

871
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,230
it's not crazy or actor.
That's not crazy.

872
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,480
There's probably,
I mean they all,

873
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:58,060
two out of 10,
two out of 10 aren't crazy.

874
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,680
I've met a lot of them.
The real nice.

875
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,540
A lot of a lot of actors that are real 
nice,

876
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:05,080
but two out of 10 probably crazy.
I'm not crazy.

877
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:06,220
Two out of 10.
Not Crazy,

878
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,790
right?
That yes,

879
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,180
I'm maybe even one out of 10.
I'm nice.

880
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,370
I try to,
I tried to be nice.

881
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,810
They go crazy.
And the more,

882
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,330
the more uh,
ah,

883
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,900
I was going to say,
the more popular they are,

884
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,090
the more successful they are,
the crazier they are.

885
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:22,180
But those are not as crazy too.
You have another just crazy,

886
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:24,700
you know who's not crazy at all?
Rosario Dawson.

887
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,620
She's great.
Super Hot.

888
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:27,723
Super cold.
Super normal around or be still with 

889
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:31,210
her.
What does that,

890
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,413
it's the,
that animated film I made with Rob 

891
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,770
Zombie.
Oh yeah.

892
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,603
Yeah.
She's like one of the weirder ones I've 

893
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:38,050
ever met.
You're like,

894
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:39,550
Huh.
You're not even like an actress.

895
00:40:39,551 --> 00:40:41,260
You're like a normal,
like a normal person.

896
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,730
Yeah.
What happened?

897
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,250
Do you,
are you a moon?

898
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:49,850
Dangerous didn't get the sickness.
I want awards given Sinatra give uh,

899
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:15,390
his divorce papers to me a while she was
doing a rosemary's baby,

900
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,190
I believe.
Something along those lines.

901
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,820
She was like on the set with Polanski 
and he delivered,

902
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,983
had delivered the uh,
you're hitting the skids baby right in 

903
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:32,491
the middle of her acting well back in 
those days to people just,

904
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,460
you know,
like a guy like Sinatra

905
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,013
keys put there had been like,
had there ever think of this when 

906
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:46,520
Sinatra was a celebrity was like when he
became famous was like,

907
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,130
cause the 30s right,
right.

908
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,213
Okay.
So the 30s and the forties how long had 

909
00:41:52,131 --> 00:41:57,131
celebrity even been around brand new for
movies and film?

910
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:01,300
Singing like opera stars,
but yeah.

911
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,830
Yeah,
not like that.

912
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:04,883
What's my,
she was 21 and he was 50 when they were 

913
00:42:08,381 --> 00:42:10,420
married and she lost her virginity to 
him.

914
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,440
That's right.
She did.

915
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,663
Whoa.
So he made that baby when he was in his 

916
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:18,650
fifties yes.
What an animal that's older than us.

917
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:20,480
Dude.
We still got hope now.

918
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,030
Still got hope.
The kids doesn't even see my testic.

919
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,593
Does he know why?
Back then they didn't have the fucking 

920
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:26,390
vaccines,
man,

921
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,100
you're the died or you live,
but you didn't get artistic.

922
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,230
I'm joking folks,
don't get mad at me.

923
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:34,064
Joe.
Redington anti-vaxxer why don't you go 

924
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,430
hang out with Jenny Mccarthy?
They would just wait.

925
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,140
They just wait for anything that can,
like someone was fucking saying,

926
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,130
he's a trump supporter.
He's a trump supporter.

927
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,170
Someone saying I'm a trump supporter the
other day.

928
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,011
Oh really?
Yeah.

929
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:47,640
And then some,
some uh,

930
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,810
Internet thing.
There was like a little twitter argument

931
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,590
eating back forth between two people.
Mike,

932
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,603
I'm not a fucking trunk.
You can't just say I'm a trump 

933
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,910
supporter.
I'm mocked the guy all the time.

934
00:42:55,911 --> 00:42:57,350
Why are you saying I'm a trump 
supporter?

935
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,600
Yeah,
it's up there.

936
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,880
They're just waiting.
They can define you.

937
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,410
Yeah.
They want to like,

938
00:43:02,411 --> 00:43:03,670
you're a truther,
right?

939
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,520
You're a va,
an anti-vaxxer.

940
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,600
Oh,
great.

941
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,710
I was on,
did I tell you this?

942
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,990
I was on a,
I feel like I might've told you,

943
00:43:10,991 --> 00:43:12,940
but I'll tell you again because we can't
remember anything.

944
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:14,620
Anyway,
I was on a,

945
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:19,300
I was back in New York and I went on a 
open gym and in the morning,

946
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,060
and I was talking about,
uh,

947
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,920
Jim was talking about trump and that was
the beginning of trump.

948
00:43:23,921 --> 00:43:25,650
And I was saying I,
I've met,

949
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:26,563
met the guy,
I don't feel like there's a little 

950
00:43:28,181 --> 00:43:30,940
something sleazy about the guy.
There's something there that's,

951
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,283
you know,
you should hold different standards for 

952
00:43:34,061 --> 00:43:36,010
this office.
I don't say where,

953
00:43:36,011 --> 00:43:38,560
I'm not saying I'm on Hillary's side or 
anything,

954
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:41,770
I'm independent,
but I'm talking about the trump thing.

955
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,530
The twitter feed goes crazy.
Uh,

956
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:45,940
hilary lover,
you know,

957
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,560
they just come back,
liberal,

958
00:43:47,561 --> 00:43:48,780
blah blah blah.
I go,

959
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:53,820
I go on Larry Wilmore that night and uh,
on the uh,

960
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:54,663
on his show,
the nightly show and there's a story 

961
00:43:56,411 --> 00:43:59,020
about some girl who's yells at her boss 
on,

962
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:03,730
on twitter that,
cause she worked for Yelp I think.

963
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:04,564
And he wasn't paying her enough.
She was complaining about being poor in 

964
00:44:08,171 --> 00:44:09,004
her twenties and screw the man and he 
should pay me more and all this kind of 

965
00:44:11,471 --> 00:44:13,210
stuff.
And it was more to it.

966
00:44:13,211 --> 00:44:14,044
But I came down on the side of,
we're all poor in our twenties so you 

967
00:44:16,011 --> 00:44:17,110
just got to suck it up.
You know,

968
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,393
I was making $5 a night doing stand up,
just eat your noodles and kept working 

969
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:27,391
and puck up the twitter feed after that 
trump supporter lover,

970
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,160
right wing white and titled Ass Holla.
White asshole is

971
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,993
if the Melanin in your skin has anything
to do with your ideas about how the 

972
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:38,220
world works.
But you're free to say it now.

973
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,130
Yeah,
white privilege white.

974
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,223
But it just that in one day people were 
coming on both sides trying to 

975
00:44:45,961 --> 00:44:46,794
categorize me on both sides of it.
Did you feel like you were in the 

976
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:50,040
middle?
Like officially?

977
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,460
I felt pretty great.
I felt pretty good.

978
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,130
When you get back to that woody allen 
thing for a second,

979
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,490
there's,
there's a big fuss about him now because

980
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,324
people were sort of like defending him 
because he does these movies and the 

981
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:10,830
movies are critically acclaimed and 
people look at them as like vehicles for

982
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:15,360
awards and radicals for a career jump.
And so people work with them.

983
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,630
Yeah.
And at the very least,

984
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,470
the very least he married his daughter.
Yes.

985
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,393
See there's a picture the me that 
defines him and this is why we can't be 

986
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:27,444
friends.

987
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:31,290
You and Winnie and I,
you and I are friends when you feel bad.

988
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:32,250
Well,
I'm fucked dude.

989
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:34,600
Let me be the judge of that.
Let me see what you say about what it,

990
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,220
there's a picture of him with,
um,

991
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,850
Sunni's at her name on his lap at a 
base,

992
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:41,723
a basketball game.
There it is right there when she was a 

993
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:45,054
little girl.
And then there's another picture of the 

994
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:48,054
two of them together when she's grown up
in there holding hands and they're at a 

995
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:54,210
basketball game as well.
Wow.

996
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:56,640
And that's C as a guy who,
well,

997
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,890
as a guy who grew up with a 
stepdaughter.

998
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:00,203
Yeah.
That's fuck beyond belief because my 

999
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,810
stepdaughter,
my daughter,

1000
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,110
she,
I don't call my stepdaughter.

1001
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,440
She's my daughter.
She calls me Daddy.

1002
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:08,580
Yeah,
she's my daughter.

1003
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,590
How old was she when you were on the 
scene?

1004
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,110
Well,
just like she was little,

1005
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:13,380
right?

1006
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,380
So specifically like she's a woman now 
and specifically she was tiny then.

1007
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,480
So like this is the same thing.
I'm looking at this,

1008
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,493
so I'm looking at woody would that 
little girl on his lap and then I'm 

1009
00:46:24,841 --> 00:46:26,430
gonna looking at woody holding hands 
with her.

1010
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:30,960
Like there's a weirdness to that kind of
relationship.

1011
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,720
Yeah.
Like that's undeniable.

1012
00:46:33,721 --> 00:46:36,510
How old is she in that picture?
She's like fucking six man.

1013
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:38,610
That's a tiny little girl sitting on his
lap.

1014
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,270
Oh my God.
That's weird to see.

1015
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,133
That is,
I've never seen that dad is where and 

1016
00:46:43,171 --> 00:46:47,190
there's something also that's creepy 
about his face in that picture and maybe

1017
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:49,860
it's because we know that he eventually 
wound up fucking her.

1018
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,030
It's also weird that you don't see his 
hands deep,

1019
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,320
deep in her ass.
I heard sort of hurt.

1020
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:56,880
No.
That picture though,

1021
00:46:56,881 --> 00:47:00,570
that face is like he's getting Daddy's 
get candy for you.

1022
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,090
You know there's like this some 
creepiness to his face.

1023
00:47:03,091 --> 00:47:06,780
Obviously it's a still picture.
He might've been about to sneeze.

1024
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:10,890
You know you've been creepy,
creepy face.

1025
00:47:10,891 --> 00:47:12,030
Fuck.
You know,

1026
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:15,600
like you ever hear photos of someone 
like that is also very rude.

1027
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,080
Did you ever hear emos joke,
Emo Phillips joke about that?

1028
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:20,123
No.
One of the best jokes I've heard by emo 

1029
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:24,360
Phillips and he's like,
Hey,

1030
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,580
just qualified that by hemophilus.
Well,

1031
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,010
it's a lot of jokes up there.
He's so funny.

1032
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,140
But uh,
he's choke is uh,

1033
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,873
uh,
woody Allen adopted soon when she was 

1034
00:47:37,001 --> 00:47:37,834
four years old,
married her when she was 16 patience of 

1035
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:50,251
a saint and he married when she was 16.
So that can't be right.

1036
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,370
I don't think legally you can,
oh boy.

1037
00:47:55,371 --> 00:47:56,204
Maybe 18.
Maybe they started dating when she was 

1038
00:47:57,431 --> 00:47:59,040
16.
It's illegal.

1039
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,780
It's not legal until that picture is,
that does kind of,

1040
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,860
I've never seen that picture before on a
kinder and my,

1041
00:48:05,861 --> 00:48:06,310
in my,
uh,

1042
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,530
obviously my,
my life,

1043
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:09,850
um,
you know,

1044
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:12,280
the way I look at it,
it's like I'm not looking at someone who

1045
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,880
doesn't have children,
nor are you when you have children,

1046
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:18,670
you know what it's like to raise a 
little tiny people and then have them be

1047
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:19,120
grown up.

1048
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,953
And then the idea of like,
say if you and your wife got divorced 

1049
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,450
when you were younger and your four year
old went to live with another guy and he

1050
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:29,284
lived with her until she was 18,
then he wound up marrying her and 

1051
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:33,070
fucking write and having kids with her.
See what I'm saying?

1052
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:34,950
Yeah.
But you see what I'm saying?

1053
00:48:34,951 --> 00:48:36,730
But that is exactly what we're talking 
about.

1054
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:40,510
Okay.
So that's an intense flaw.

1055
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,970
Huge.
But that being said,

1056
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,510
two questions.
Will you watch his movies?

1057
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,580
I've watched these movies.
Yeah.

1058
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:49,121
It's,
it's,

1059
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:49,954
it's a stink in the air though.
If he calls you and wants you to be in 

1060
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:54,940
his next film,
you don't work with them.

1061
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,630
You do not go no fucking way.
No fucking way.

1062
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,540
Not like he's calling me or anything.
Did you grow up thinking woody Allen was

1063
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:03,460
like a comedy?
God,

1064
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:04,300
no.

1065
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,640
Um,
I grew up thinking it was very funny.

1066
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:08,770
Like his movies were really funny.
I enjoy it.

1067
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:10,050
A lot of his movies,
you know,

1068
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:10,923
he wasn't like one of your guys deeper 
Annie Hall and know he had a lot of 

1069
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:14,680
great films.
I mean,

1070
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:17,740
he's amazing films.
He uses the misdemeanors,

1071
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,830
Hannah and her sisters and,
and even the most recent stuff,

1072
00:49:20,831 --> 00:49:22,690
the dice clay movie.
What was that?

1073
00:49:22,691 --> 00:49:24,160
Jasmine blue.
Yeah,

1074
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,180
that was great.
Uh,

1075
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:26,800
Barcelona.
Yeah,

1076
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,950
that was great.
And Barcelona and what was the missing?

1077
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,330
Midnight in Paris that was really good 
to amazing.

1078
00:49:31,331 --> 00:49:31,891
Yeah.
We're owned,

1079
00:49:31,891 --> 00:49:36,650
Wilson actually plays Woody Allen.
Woody Allen impression.

1080
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,680
Woody Allen got,
yeah,

1081
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,420
it was interesting.
And that's where he joined.

1082
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:41,590
Brodie was great.
He was playing Salvador Dali.

1083
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,050
I am done Dolly.
Yeah,

1084
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,251
he's,
look,

1085
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:48,820
he's obviously really good at making 
movies,

1086
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,013
but you know,
we played some of stand up on the 

1087
00:49:52,211 --> 00:49:53,550
podcast before.
Right.

1088
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,513
And from like the 60s,
the early sixties and he was always a 

1089
00:49:57,851 --> 00:50:02,560
pervert and early stand up.
It was like really pervy yes.

1090
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,143
We'll look at sleeper.
There's a giant tip chasing him across 

1091
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:10,570
the park in central park.
This giant lactating tip,

1092
00:50:10,571 --> 00:50:12,760
50 feet up.
Quit.

1093
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,250
This guy was a pervert.
He was a weird fucking guy.

1094
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,390
I know.
Oh No,

1095
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:17,021
no.
If,

1096
00:50:17,021 --> 00:50:19,630
ands or buts about it.
He was a weird fucking guy.

1097
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,180
And he is a weird fucking guy.
Yes.

1098
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,063
And,
and I guess what he's done is not a 

1099
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:28,040
crime because if you,
um,

1100
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,250
if you look at the actual law,
he didn't do anything wrong.

1101
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,250
It's not as biological daughter.
No.

1102
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,530
You know,
you meet with soon.

1103
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

1104
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,333
So I guess he can kind of do that.
But then there's a thing that his 

1105
00:50:39,341 --> 00:50:42,260
biological daughter says that he did 
weird shit to her.

1106
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:47,740
The problem with that is that he says 
that his daughter was coached by the mom

1107
00:50:47,841 --> 00:50:50,090
and there's just no way to know.
I mean,

1108
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:50,953
I know it would be horrible if you 
accused him of sexually molesting his 

1109
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:57,050
daughter and was really just a 
manipulation by the mother.

1110
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,980
And that is entirely possible.
You don't know.

1111
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:00,814
And there's this idea that you're never 
supposed to judge someone who's making 

1112
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:07,190
an accusation.
He never supposed to question them.

1113
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,440
They are the victim about.
And by that,

1114
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:10,303
I think that's nonsense.
There's an incredibly large amount of 

1115
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:15,290
fake rape cases,
fake molestation cases.

1116
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,230
These people lie about everything.
They lie about money,

1117
00:51:18,231 --> 00:51:22,820
they lie about sex,
they lie fuck by Frank Sinatra

1118
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:27,740
married exactly till he turns out to be 
old blue eyes.

1119
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,720
Just that alone.
Just that you're like,

1120
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:30,330
listen,
bitch,

1121
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,060
you got a problem with the truth,
right?

1122
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:33,010
Exactly.
Yeah.

1123
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,310
That's the other side of it,
right?

1124
00:51:34,311 --> 00:51:35,144
She's not claiming there's taking that 
crooner Dick while she was living with 

1125
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:38,354
woody.
I know she'd sneak off or a common just 

1126
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:45,770
going to go out and get a coffee and 
just fucking toupee falls off.

1127
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,870
Welcome to the club.
I gave you a kid.

1128
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,690
All of a sudden he became dice.
Oh,

1129
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:57,320
what a world diamond love.
Now.

1130
00:51:57,321 --> 00:51:58,460
It's very tricky.
I mean,

1131
00:51:58,461 --> 00:51:59,240
look,
if you're,

1132
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,073
if your wife had any hint that something
was going on with you like crazy and 

1133
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:05,930
just like,
you know,

1134
00:52:05,931 --> 00:52:08,150
just please.
There's,

1135
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,700
it's very complicated.
It's very sleek.

1136
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:15,900
Did eventually leave her for the Suny 
Mama?

1137
00:52:15,911 --> 00:52:18,030
What do we like?
Gossipers I just think,

1138
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:18,960
no,
but it's money.

1139
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:19,794
It isn't,
but it is kind of an interesting thing 

1140
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:21,451
because,
I mean,

1141
00:52:21,451 --> 00:52:22,284
if you were to what you said of like 
that it represents other people that do 

1142
00:52:26,161 --> 00:52:29,790
this as the kind of the swing thing,
because everybody,

1143
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:31,583
if you didn't work with people because 
of their private life and things you 

1144
00:52:34,681 --> 00:52:36,780
didn't agree with,
you would never work with anybody.

1145
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:38,860
Would you imagine?
They're a mess down

1146
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,240
with them and go over their private 
life.

1147
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:42,790
Okay.
Have you ever lied to a cop?

1148
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,840
Right,
right.

1149
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,880
You know,
have you ever lied about speeding,

1150
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,910
but have you ever not paid your taxes?
Now let's get into your sex life.

1151
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,790
Do you ever think about other people 
when you come?

1152
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:57,090
Right.
Okay.

1153
00:52:58,031 --> 00:52:58,864
This meeting is over.
I had a buddy of mine that actually got 

1154
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,110
an argument like that with his 
girlfriend.

1155
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:02,944
She was like,
my friend says that guy's fantasize 

1156
00:53:04,511 --> 00:53:06,550
about other women while they're having 
sex with your girlfriend.

1157
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,990
Is that true?
And he was like,

1158
00:53:07,991 --> 00:53:08,920
well,
sometimes she's like,

1159
00:53:08,921 --> 00:53:11,680
you fucking piece of shit.
She got really mad at him.

1160
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,070
Right.
And I'm like,

1161
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,590
I don't remember thinking about it.
Like,

1162
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:18,220
why do you care?
I guess if your wife would just thinking

1163
00:53:18,221 --> 00:53:22,270
about just getting stuffed by some big 
ass country football player,

1164
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,433
some big dude with like chewing tobacco 
in his mouth and fucking rebel flag hat 

1165
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:27,090
on.

1166
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:27,923
He's just laying pipe on her and that's 
what you're thinking about when you 

1167
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:32,760
fucker,
she's thinking about some corn Fred,

1168
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,000
you know?
Imagine.

1169
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,350
Right?
It'd be like,

1170
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,213
ah fuck man.
But that's why you don't ask the 

1171
00:53:40,171 --> 00:53:42,360
question.
That's why you don't ask.

1172
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:44,250
You don't probably,
there probably is happening,

1173
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:46,950
but you don't ask if,
if you really love your wife,

1174
00:53:46,951 --> 00:53:48,530
you want to know everything about her.
Nah,

1175
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,960
you want to know everything.
She's just appointed.

1176
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:56,910
Oh my God,
I love you honey.

1177
00:53:56,911 --> 00:53:58,620
But I hate that face you make when you 
come.

1178
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,150
You make me disgusted.
That's why I'm all fuck you.

1179
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,120
He just walked into the kitchen in the 
morning,

1180
00:54:03,121 --> 00:54:04,680
honey,
what are you thinking?

1181
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:08,070
So next time you fucker just wear a 
luchador mask or even better yet,

1182
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:13,071
like I'll godzilla rubber Godzilla.
Hey fantasies are weird man because like

1183
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:19,910
I can't,

1184
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:22,160
I remember when I was in high school 
there was a,

1185
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:23,303
a guy who was writing for the Newton 
south high school paper who wrote this 

1186
00:54:26,571 --> 00:54:27,404
cool thing about the boy scouts.
And I remember reading this because I 

1187
00:54:29,721 --> 00:54:32,120
was in the boy scouts briefly,
uh,

1188
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:34,370
as a young teenager and they had,
you know,

1189
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,560
the tenants like trustworthy,
loyal,

1190
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,300
thrifty,
clean,

1191
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:39,223
reverent and like one of the things 
about what the voice boy scouts were 

1192
00:54:43,161 --> 00:54:45,690
supposed to do is keep your mind pure,
right?

1193
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,980
Keep your thoughts pure.
And this guy was like,

1194
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,873
who wrote this article?
Obviously this is in high school in the 

1195
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,610
1980s.
Yeah,

1196
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,950
Guy was pretty brilliant and he was 
like,

1197
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,113
I don't like the idea of anyone telling 
me what I can and can't do with my 

1198
00:54:59,271 --> 00:55:01,430
thoughts because sometimes my thoughts 
are fun.

1199
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:04,850
I like to explore the idea of,
of,

1200
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,713
of thinking about these and his argument
in this newspaper and I'm like grossly 

1201
00:55:08,871 --> 00:55:09,704
paraphrasing him cause again,
this is from 1982 or something like 

1202
00:55:12,141 --> 00:55:13,400
that.
He was like,

1203
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,610
you like you don't need to know what's 
going on in my thoughts.

1204
00:55:16,611 --> 00:55:20,300
You just need you to know how I act.
That's how I act is important.

1205
00:55:20,301 --> 00:55:22,850
Not what I think.
So tell me to keep my thoughts pure.

1206
00:55:22,851 --> 00:55:24,590
He's like,
my thoughts are mine.

1207
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:26,330
They're mine.
I do what I want with them.

1208
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:27,223
That's right.
So if your girlfriend is just thinking 

1209
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,324
about that big country fucker,
I was like a piece of wheat coming out 

1210
00:55:32,001 --> 00:55:32,840
of the corner of his mouth,

1211
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:38,540
Tattoo on the back of his neck,
just laying dick.

1212
00:55:38,541 --> 00:55:40,730
God bless her fat Dick.
God bless her.

1213
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,790
Whenever she's into like a sailor's 
forearm.

1214
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,653
I am not asking.
I mean don't you have moments like in 

1215
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:49,550
your relationship where you know you're 
with each other for your life?

1216
00:55:49,551 --> 00:55:51,620
This is,
this is a long time thing.

1217
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,120
I feel like we should meet and there's 
no music.

1218
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:54,830
There's times when you're all of a 
sudden,

1219
00:55:54,831 --> 00:55:55,180
oh no,
no,

1220
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:59,270
no.
This time he went to get some incredible

1221
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:04,271
hulk walkaway music and there's times 
when you were into her and that's it.

1222
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:09,600
There's times when you know there's 
times when all of a sudden you,

1223
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:09,920
you,
you,

1224
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,753
you,
you about to say there's times when 

1225
00:56:11,841 --> 00:56:13,460
she's not in the EU.
Yes.

1226
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,840
Unacceptable.
Walk.

1227
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:17,270
Be a man.
Suck it up.

1228
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,960
There's times when you were like,
you know what,

1229
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:23,030
it not that psyched with me right now.
[inaudible] with a boner.

1230
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:26,170
You chew to Viagra.
You get your Dick hard as a rock.

1231
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:33,610
I'm not saying you don't do this thing.
What I'm saying is you don't ask her why

1232
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,740
you don't ask what?
What is it like?

1233
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,330
You don't want to know these things.
I don't want to know why she's unhappy.

1234
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:41,973
I want to know.
I just want her to keep her thoughts to 

1235
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:45,724
herself.
If she's bang some big redneck and a 

1236
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:49,570
truck stop.
No,

1237
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:50,470
you don't want,
I don't want to do,

1238
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,410
you don't want to know if she's actually
bang or thinking about bang.

1239
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,330
I don't want to know anything.
You don't want anything?

1240
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,400
Oh No.
What a good husband.

1241
00:56:57,401 --> 00:57:02,401
You want her to just be a good mom,
a good wife and eat my bread.

1242
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:05,403
And,
and how about she cooks something once 

1243
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:08,824
in a while.
Why am I baking bread like I'm an old 

1244
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:11,314
lady.

1245
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,520
Why am I running around with a flower on
my shirt?

1246
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,190
She's sitting on the couch.
You wear an apron?

1247
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,470
No,
I have thought about it,

1248
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:22,530
but I feel like it's going over.
Yeah.

1249
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:26,110
What did you keep in the pocket?
I always wonder one head pocket.

1250
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:28,570
Why?
Why is that even come up?

1251
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:30,190
Well,
who throws shit and that front pocket,

1252
00:57:30,191 --> 00:57:32,700
I think it's useless.
A one hit and the razor blade.

1253
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,383
A one hitter and a razor blade.
I never see anybody using that front 

1254
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:39,430
pocket on the Apron.
Yeah.

1255
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,780
Never comes up.
No.

1256
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:41,740
Well yeah.
What's in there?

1257
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:43,170
Nothing.
You're lighter.

1258
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,600
So it's cooked.
Show is go out and smoke a little.

1259
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:46,690
Yeah,
they do smoke.

1260
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,520
Which is interesting because cigarettes,
Dell,

1261
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:50,200
your taste buds,
they don't care.

1262
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:51,280
Food.
This is food.

1263
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,890
Fuck God.
I don't eat in the shit.

1264
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:00,940
But I always thought that was weird 
about chefs because the whole idea about

1265
00:58:00,941 --> 00:58:04,030
preparing food is making something 
that's delicious.

1266
00:58:04,031 --> 00:58:05,080
It's an art form,
right?

1267
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:05,620
Yeah.
So,

1268
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,030
but if you,
you're dulling,

1269
00:58:07,031 --> 00:58:09,370
it's like fucking with the condom.
It's like I'm really in a sec,

1270
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,800
but I love condoms.
I don't know what to do.

1271
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:13,300
I don't know.
I never smoke.

1272
00:58:13,301 --> 00:58:15,310
How much does it dead and your does it 
really?

1273
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,350
I don't never smoked either,
but allegedly it does.

1274
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,420
Yeah.
The people that I've talked to that quit

1275
00:58:19,421 --> 00:58:21,850
smoking say that was one of the most 
remarkable things about it.

1276
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,210
Is it right after you quit smoking,
you get your taste buds back?

1277
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:27,790
Eh Hm.
But you don't look as cool.

1278
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,130
Hmm.
What is that about?

1279
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:31,863
What's it about?
Something so stupid when you're sucking 

1280
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,430
on some burning leaves.
A prop.

1281
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,700
A good prop though.
Like people that vape do not look cool.

1282
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,660
They look like they've got a pacifier 
sucking on a robot's Dick,

1283
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,630
you know?
Well,

1284
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:51,490
they have that box box ones.
Like how much batteries do you need?

1285
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:54,970
How much you vape thing?
Give a fucking battery that can charge a

1286
00:58:54,971 --> 00:58:55,804
car and it glows like Rudolph and then 
they blow the smoke clouds out like 

1287
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,200
fucking Christ.
What is this?

1288
00:59:02,201 --> 00:59:04,960
There's so much that comes out and they 
get into it.

1289
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,040
They get into the big giant clouds.
Yeah,

1290
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:07,903
they do.
She sent me one and he sent me one that 

1291
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:14,560
I could literally kill someone with.
I could beat someone to death with it.

1292
00:59:14,561 --> 00:59:16,690
It's a big thick,
heavy copper one.

1293
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,900
Do we still have that stupid thing 
laying around tobacco or for weed?

1294
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:22,070
It's for tobacco,
but you could use it for,

1295
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,950
we'd definitely use,
we'd have yet like weed oil.

1296
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,003
And it was,
it was a weird thing where you had to 

1297
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:32,411
like Ge drip the oil into this thing and
then we don't need to see a jamie.

1298
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,270
It's okay.
Thank you though.

1299
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:37,970
It was um,
but it was fucking heavy.

1300
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:39,560
Like it probably weighed a pound,
right?

1301
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:42,040
At least a pound.
Yeah.

1302
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,330
For home use or you're not taking that 
into the bar.

1303
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,670
I supposed to just fucking carry it 
around in a slang.

1304
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,390
It looked like brass knuckles.
Yeah.

1305
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:50,050
Yeah.
Really huge.

1306
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,910
Fucking huge.
Now it didn't have a case.

1307
00:59:52,911 --> 00:59:53,744
It should,
should have a wheeler case so you can 

1308
00:59:54,441 --> 00:59:55,940
take it through the airport.
That's not cool.

1309
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:58,880
But cigarette to sit there with just the
cigarette in your hand.

1310
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,600
It's a nudge.
A baby.

1311
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:06,430
That stripe baby sending Mia.
You tell me.

1312
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:13,340
I don't want to talk into that.
Jus the chairman of the boat has spoken.

1313
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,250
It's the coolest.
It's a cool prop.

1314
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:19,610
You can do stuff with it apparently can 
make a point.

1315
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:20,773
Yeah.
Apparently it's a really good cognitive 

1316
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:25,310
enhancer to oh yeah.
Yeah.

1317
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:27,610
Nicotine is apparently,
um,

1318
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:32,000
it's as effective as like a new tropic 
as a co,

1319
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,580
as a cognitive enhancer.
Like vitamins,

1320
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:36,410
like Parasso tem and all these different
vitamins.

1321
01:00:36,411 --> 01:00:37,244
Coleen that had been shown to have 
effects on memory and cognitive 

1322
01:00:39,771 --> 01:00:40,604
function.
Nicotine apparently has a positive 

1323
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:42,854
effect on cognitive function.
I know a lot of guys who smoke like 

1324
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:48,890
e-cigarettes before they go on stage.
Really just to get a little,

1325
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:50,150
a little buzz,
a little buzz,

1326
01:00:50,151 --> 01:00:51,980
a little go coffee,
do the same thing.

1327
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,413
I don't know.
I don't think coffee actually has a 

1328
01:00:56,090 --> 01:01:01,090
cognitive enhancing performance benefits
that have been proven.

1329
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,410
Just makes you busy,
makes you happier.

1330
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:07,400
I know it increases euphoria and I think
it lights you up.

1331
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:08,323
You like [inaudible] stimulates you.
So there's probably some benefit in 

1332
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:13,460
that.
Just being more awake.

1333
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,540
If you are awake though,
I don't know if it really benefits you.

1334
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:22,430
Like there's times when I'm writing and 
like if I'm writing in the afternoon and

1335
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:23,264
I'll have an espresso and they come back
and all of a sudden I'll catch myself 

1336
01:01:26,571 --> 01:01:27,404
like 15 minutes later.
Like just humming along and like doing 

1337
01:01:29,931 --> 01:01:30,531
studying,
you know,

1338
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:32,690
like you just get busy.
You just get like,

1339
01:01:32,691 --> 01:01:33,524
all right,
we're going.

1340
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,363
Yeah.
Without being aware that it was really 

1341
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:37,070
the caffeine.
Yeah.

1342
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:38,323
Do you take the note?
What does it neurotropic nootropic 

1343
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,780
nootropics.
I'd take them.

1344
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,430
You do?
I'm a big fan.

1345
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:47,240
I want to take more stuff.
I really do.

1346
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,433
I'm so into like,
I kept for a long time it was like I'm 

1347
01:01:51,171 --> 01:01:53,340
not taking anything.
And uh,

1348
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,960
now I'm at a point where it's like we 
live in the 21st century.

1349
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:00,290
It's time to start taking some stuff.
Like what kind of stuff?

1350
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:02,840
I take vitamin D now.
That's good.

1351
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:05,030
D Three d three yeah.
Very good.

1352
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,230
Very important.
That's good,

1353
01:02:06,231 --> 01:02:06,630
right?
Yeah.

1354
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:09,590
Well the only way you get it is through 
the son or through certain foods.

1355
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,260
It's particularly important for Vegans,
right?

1356
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:16,670
Be 12 and [inaudible] are two of the 
most common things.

1357
01:02:16,671 --> 01:02:19,040
Be 12 too.
Because it comes from

1358
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:20,910
um,
you,

1359
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:21,743
we get it primarily be 12 especially.
We get it primarily from an animal 

1360
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:27,360
protein and they apparently get it from 
bacteria.

1361
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,620
And the only way to vegans can get it is
in certain forms of bacteria.

1362
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:34,290
Microorganisms like you have to eat 
living things to get it.

1363
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:37,710
All right,
so be 12 I should add also be 12 huge be

1364
01:02:37,711 --> 01:02:41,470
12 big a d three is tig,
three d,

1365
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:45,420
h e a or not thca a Dha,
fish oil.

1366
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:46,590
Oh really?
Fish oil,

1367
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:48,750
Omega threes and sixes.
Super,

1368
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:51,510
super important for brain function.
Omega,

1369
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:54,240
Omega threes and sixes.
You take that as a supplement that yes,

1370
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:57,600
I do.
You can get some of it from flax oil and

1371
01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:00,420
from hemp oil,
but it's not as effective as fish oil.

1372
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,720
I mean,
this is taken out ideology and you know,

1373
01:03:03,721 --> 01:03:04,554
eating plants versus eating animals 
scientist uniformly believe that fish 

1374
01:03:09,211 --> 01:03:12,090
oil is the better method for absorbing 
those things.

1375
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:12,953
But then you go online and you look up 
fish oil and there's just as much as 

1376
01:03:17,941 --> 01:03:20,310
many articles.
The fish oil does nothing.

1377
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:23,070
Well,
Omega threes and sixes are critical,

1378
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:24,660
right?
That's what fish oil is.

1379
01:03:24,661 --> 01:03:26,960
We just know that from the official.
Yeah,

1380
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,530
there's,
there's no doubt about that.

1381
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:30,360
So someone's saying the fish oil does 
nothing.

1382
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,920
That's nonsense.
It's nonsense.

1383
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:33,690
What does it do?
I mean,

1384
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:35,730
here's,
here's the number one big deal.

1385
01:03:35,731 --> 01:03:36,564
People think that they like to take 
things and then feeling an immediate 

1386
01:03:39,061 --> 01:03:41,820
result.
And what you're doing when you're taking

1387
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:42,654
vitamins and supplements and eating 
healthy food is your building your body 

1388
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,890
with these,
these materials.

1389
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:53,280
Like if you eat cake and Ho hos and 
that's all you eat,

1390
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,520
that's what your body uses to regenerate
cells.

1391
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:58,110
That's where it,
your body uses to grow.

1392
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,093
I mean all your tissue is eventually 
going to be made out of everything you 

1393
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,690
eat of birthday deck,
birthing kit,

1394
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:06,210
and then then sourdough bread.

1395
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:08,063
So what we are today is your body's 
consumption of all the different foods 

1396
01:04:12,631 --> 01:04:15,600
and nutrients that you've taken in.
And this is what it's built with it.

1397
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,310
And it can only make a good body off of 
good ingredients.

1398
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,400
It's,
it's really that simple.

1399
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:23,543
If you're not getting any vitamins,
your body starts pulling them out of 

1400
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:26,880
your bones and your,
I mean,

1401
01:04:26,881 --> 01:04:28,870
pulling calcium out of your bones.
Right?

1402
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,170
But your body freaks the fuck out when 
you don't have enough stuff.

1403
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,510
And that's where a lot of diseases,
inflammation,

1404
01:04:33,511 --> 01:04:36,630
a lot of problems come from just not 
having the proper building blocks.

1405
01:04:36,631 --> 01:04:39,000
So,
right when you eat healthy,

1406
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,690
you give your body what it needs to 
rebuild and build.

1407
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:43,583
Right.
So your growth from there on represents 

1408
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:48,540
your diet.
Like whatever you're putting in,

1409
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:50,850
the healthier the stuff is,
the healthier your body is.

1410
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:51,684
It's really simple,
but it's not going to be an immediate 

1411
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:54,120
effect I've had.

1412
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,370
It would be pretty quick though.
Fairly quick.

1413
01:04:56,371 --> 01:05:00,630
You'll feel better and over time,
like weeks or months like this,

1414
01:05:00,631 --> 01:05:04,350
a wacky die that I'm on.
Initially it didn't feel good.

1415
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,710
It didn't know there's lack of sugar.
Did not feel good.

1416
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:08,573
Uh,
there's like headaches the first few 

1417
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:11,020
days.
Oh,

1418
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,170
I'm addicted to sugar will,
I didn't even know.

1419
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:17,800
And then forms of sugar,
like even just bread while you yeah,

1420
01:05:17,801 --> 01:05:18,730
for sure.
Right?

1421
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:19,564
Yeah.
Bread,

1422
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,570
even alcohol.
Um,

1423
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:22,803
fruits,
you have to be careful even how much 

1424
01:05:24,101 --> 01:05:25,570
fruit you eat.
Really?

1425
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:26,733
Yeah.
Like,

1426
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,550
like someone had a glass of orange juice
and they were talking about it.

1427
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,384
They were like,
think about how many fucking oranges go 

1428
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:35,740
into the glass of orange juice.
It's probably like seven oranges.

1429
01:05:35,741 --> 01:05:38,230
Like really fuck sits down,
eats seven oranges.

1430
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:40,150
And we were laughing and I was like,
yeah,

1431
01:05:40,151 --> 01:05:41,530
but not even with fiber.

1432
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,080
Like you take the fiber out so your 
body's like,

1433
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:46,930
what is all this God damn sugar.
Right?

1434
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,160
But we have it in our head that sugar 
from fruit juice is healthy,

1435
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,560
right?
Sugar from Coca Cola is not,

1436
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:55,810
but apparently your body doesn't know 
the difference.

1437
01:05:55,811 --> 01:05:58,810
But if you eat an apple,
isn't that just the fiber offset?

1438
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:01,870
How much sugar?
It does have an impact.

1439
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,520
It does.
So in a positive way,

1440
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,693
your body's,
that's how your body's supposed to get 

1441
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:06,721
sugar,
right?

1442
01:06:06,721 --> 01:06:07,554
It's supposed to be attached almost like
as an incentive to eat things that are 

1443
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:11,940
healthy for you.
Right?

1444
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,833
So the vitamins and the fiber or all 
intertwined with this delicious flavor 

1445
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:17,404
that makes you attracted to it.
And therefore like you eat an orange is 

1446
01:06:19,991 --> 01:06:21,250
in fact good for you.
Right?

1447
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,820
So it's healthy.
You shouldn't eat,

1448
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,210
go crazy with it.
Yeah.

1449
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:29,170
You just shouldn't have 20 ounces of 
orange juice is squeezed out.

1450
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:30,323
Oh right.
And especially when we have that 

1451
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:34,630
concentrate stuff or it's not even 
really orange juice anymore.

1452
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:36,690
It's like this weird frozen thing.
Yeah.

1453
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,250
But when you like with your kids in the 
morning,

1454
01:06:39,251 --> 01:06:40,084
do you feel like you should give them 
some orange juice if they're like 

1455
01:06:41,651 --> 01:06:45,380
feeling kind of a vitamin C?
Well,

1456
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:47,650
vitamin C's definitely good for your 
body.

1457
01:06:47,651 --> 01:06:50,290
It's a good antioxidant and he signed 
them run down.

1458
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,580
I mean,
look,

1459
01:06:51,581 --> 01:06:53,380
it's not,
it's not the worst thing in the world.

1460
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:54,503
Have a little orange juice.
What I'm saying is like a big ass glass 

1461
01:06:57,701 --> 01:06:59,940
of orange juice as a jolt of sugar to 
your system.

1462
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:02,850
Or in the afternoon I preferred,
um,

1463
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,500
I don't drink fruit juices anymore.
Yeah.

1464
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,513
I just,
I eat,

1465
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:07,373
but I still eat fruit.
I just think that juicing is very 

1466
01:07:11,051 --> 01:07:11,884
problematic in that way.
That you could just figure out a way to 

1467
01:07:14,141 --> 01:07:14,974
condense a,
all the sugar from all these different 

1468
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:18,214
fruits and one thing that you jolt into 
your body and just a few seconds you 

1469
01:07:21,461 --> 01:07:23,410
chug a glass of orange juice.

1470
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:24,243
I mean,
that's,

1471
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,880
yeah,
a tidal wave of sugar wall.

1472
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:30,520
Um,
I take glucosamine.

1473
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,990
That's good.
And Can Jordan,

1474
01:07:31,991 --> 01:07:32,824
do you take those two together?
Just glucosomine does are both really 

1475
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:36,640
good.
Glucosomines good.

1476
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:37,503
Glucosomine was actually,
I think people might be wrong about 

1477
01:07:40,481 --> 01:07:42,670
this.
This came from this book by this guy,

1478
01:07:42,671 --> 01:07:47,200
Doctor Joel Wallach who wrote this book 
book called dead doctors don't lie.

1479
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,120
And he was talking about mineral 
deficiencies and um,

1480
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:56,200
how few doctors really do understand 
nutrition and how they give you a really

1481
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:57,034
shitty advice,
but really they're completely 

1482
01:07:57,881 --> 01:07:58,714
uneducated.
They might be a good podiatrist or a 

1483
01:08:00,281 --> 01:08:01,960
good orthopedic surgeon or what have 
you,

1484
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:05,560
but how many of them actually understand
the mechanisms of nutrition?

1485
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:07,810
That's where Doctor Rhonda Patrick comes
in.

1486
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:11,050
She's a fucking genius when it comes to 
that.

1487
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:15,440
Like whenever I have any questions about
different nutrients or vitamins and will

1488
01:08:15,441 --> 01:08:16,250
just go over

1489
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:19,880
the tasks and she's super analytical and
objective about it.

1490
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:20,714
Right?
Like she'll tell you the pros and cons 

1491
01:08:22,341 --> 01:08:24,680
and goods and bads and what you know,
what,

1492
01:08:24,681 --> 01:08:25,514
what could happen,
what could be going on and what is 

1493
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:28,270
definitely going on.
Right.

1494
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:30,020
So there's,
you know,

1495
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:31,730
there's a lot going on when you're 
eating food.

1496
01:08:31,731 --> 01:08:35,860
There's a lot going on when you're 
taking in nutrients and uh,

1497
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,360
a Multivitamin,
I take a multi,

1498
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:39,583
bless so many one multivitamin is 
problematic too because you're taking 

1499
01:08:42,891 --> 01:08:45,980
something that's condensed down to one 
hard little cube.

1500
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,330
Oh yeah.
And you're dropping down,

1501
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:48,173
you're in,
you're hoping your body digests it and 

1502
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:49,934
time and absorbs it.
I find that powdered ones in capsule 

1503
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:56,270
form at least I think a absorbed better 
in the body.

1504
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,720
And I take a pack,
I take like pure athletes,

1505
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:01,580
pure Pak,
writing it down.

1506
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:03,560
Yeah.
It's pure.

1507
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:07,910
Encapsulations is the brand that I use 
and they have these athletes,

1508
01:09:07,911 --> 01:09:09,750
pure packs and I,
I just,

1509
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:12,770
they're great because they're like a 
meals worth.

1510
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:13,783
I take them with me.
I can have like two or three in my 

1511
01:09:15,801 --> 01:09:19,640
backpack and just pound it.
Yeah,

1512
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,013
sure.
Well do you take this stuff too or do 

1513
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:23,054
you kind of a,
has it rubbed off on the amount of time 

1514
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:30,200
I've been hanging out with them.
I need to take advantage of it.

1515
01:09:30,201 --> 01:09:31,760
But uh,
yeah I just started taking some stuff.

1516
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:33,080
Yeah,
you look good.

1517
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:36,890
That microphone makes that sound.
What's going on with this?

1518
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:37,803
Too much electricity over here.
You're a fucking Atlanta and you're 

1519
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:40,713
alive.
There's a lot of electricity going on 

1520
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,610
here.
Right?

1521
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:45,673
Let's stop thinking about it when I 
think we've heard my podcast when I use 

1522
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:50,060
like this little recorder and just no 
reason.

1523
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:54,590
This is a reason it sounds so shitty.
Vape pens we have in this room.

1524
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:57,163
I know I have one of those.
So how many things do you take in the 

1525
01:09:58,341 --> 01:09:58,640
morning?

1526
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,220
Like 12 in the morning?
Um,

1527
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:02,533
especially lately the morning I've 
relaxed a lot of what I do as far as 

1528
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:11,480
like my diet cause in the morning a lot 
of times I'm not hungry.

1529
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:13,510
I'm out.
And I used to eat because I felt like it

1530
01:10:13,511 --> 01:10:15,740
had to eat,
but then I read this thing recently.

1531
01:10:15,741 --> 01:10:16,574
You know they,
they say that breakfast is your most 

1532
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:19,340
important meal.
Yeah.

1533
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,870
Bullshit.
That's what I've heard.

1534
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:23,840
It's bullshit.
What's important is meals,

1535
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,180
right?
They say that breakfast is not your most

1536
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:27,620
important meal.
That it's just a meal.

1537
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,030
The idea of like loading up so you can 
go on about your day is like it.

1538
01:10:32,031 --> 01:10:33,560
Sometimes it slows you down.
Yes.

1539
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:35,930
And then the car bloating is what a lot 
of people do.

1540
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:39,320
They're eating cereal and that's just 
going to cause a crash.

1541
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,020
Right?
You ramp it up with the carb loading.

1542
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:43,850
Your body has to process all that shit 
and it's like,

1543
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:44,693
whoa.
But a nice cup of coffee and some 

1544
01:10:46,521 --> 01:10:48,410
sourdough toast.
That's what you do.

1545
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,850
That's your move and once in a while and
you get to know him,

1546
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,940
I had this fucking toast.
This is mine.

1547
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,830
It's my goddamn comes from my made this 
from my fan.

1548
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,560
Yeah.
It's funny when I go on the road now,

1549
01:10:57,561 --> 01:11:00,050
that's the thing that they miss the 
toast.

1550
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,330
The bread really like you got to come 
back.

1551
01:11:02,331 --> 01:11:04,290
You've been gone a week.
You're ah,

1552
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:05,124
they,
they get upset that dad is not the 

1553
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:07,304
little bread factory.
It's cool because they used to miss me 

1554
01:11:09,051 --> 01:11:12,280
for being a person and then they,
then that passed.

1555
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,070
Now they want me for

1556
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,170
my bread.
When you go on the road,

1557
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:18,870
do you do just weekends or do you do,
do you ever do a tour?

1558
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,500
I do weekends.
Let me,

1559
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,520
sometimes it'll be,
I'll tag it with,

1560
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:24,383
like if I go back east,
I'll tag something in New York like tv 

1561
01:11:26,431 --> 01:11:28,530
or radio and then,
so I'll be gone for a week,

1562
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:33,390
but I never go like city to city and I 
come home.

1563
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:37,290
I don't like my friend.
You Know Duncan Duncan trussell.

1564
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,600
Yeah.
Dunkin's on a 30 day tour now.

1565
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:40,463
Really?
You got a bus and everything so it's 

1566
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:44,580
traveling around the country.
Have a family?

1567
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:45,540
Nope.
Yeah,

1568
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:46,990
I've got a dog.
It's a different thing.

1569
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,860
That's a different thing.
It says dog helps him.

1570
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:53,040
Got One of those emotional,
a little licenses.

1571
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:55,680
I call those the fake service dogs.
And you know those things.

1572
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:57,030
Yeah.
What is it called?

1573
01:11:57,031 --> 01:11:58,500
An emotional needs dog.

1574
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:00,150
Yeah,
you can have an emotional needs dog.

1575
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,680
They bring them in restaurants.
It's so fun.

1576
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:08,110
It's so fucked up because they violate 
health coach saying,

1577
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:11,160
I need my dog with me.
I know.

1578
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:12,520
I saw the,
I was in New York.

1579
01:12:12,521 --> 01:12:16,200
That one was feeding a dog from a spoon 
at the table,

1580
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:19,060
like sneaking them food.
It's like,

1581
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:20,070
how's this?
How's this?

1582
01:12:20,071 --> 01:12:21,450
Okay.
It's not okay.

1583
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:23,860
I was just in a hotel in San Francisco,
people I'd,

1584
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,870
they've given dog biscuits at the,
in the lobby and people you walk through

1585
01:12:27,871 --> 01:12:28,704
the hall,
there's dogs just barking their heads 

1586
01:12:30,451 --> 01:12:33,630
off because dogs are allowed in hotels.
Well,

1587
01:12:33,631 --> 01:12:35,280
I love dogs.
I do too,

1588
01:12:35,281 --> 01:12:39,330
but you don't have to have,
I don't even mind dogs in hotels,

1589
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:40,223
but dogs and restaurants like come on,
you ever been next to a dog that's 

1590
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:44,460
barking all night?
Because the parents are,

1591
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:45,343
because the owners are out partying or 
doing whatever they're doing and leave 

1592
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:51,870
the dog really and you're then they 
should have someone come in,

1593
01:12:51,871 --> 01:12:56,871
euthanize it.
You shouldn't have even said that.

1594
01:12:58,820 --> 01:12:59,820
Right.
You're right.

1595
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:01,620
Sometimes things come out and you don't 
mean them to,

1596
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,410
sometimes you mean them and you just 
pretend that you don't.

1597
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:06,493
If some dog next door is barking,
I would like to key to the room so I 

1598
01:13:08,821 --> 01:13:09,840
could open it up and go,
dude,

1599
01:13:09,841 --> 01:13:12,210
it's going to be all right.
Relax I there's a biscuit.

1600
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:17,010
Yeah,
you relaxed.

1601
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:22,403
But this is why I'm,
I'm embracing the 21st century cause 

1602
01:13:25,441 --> 01:13:26,310
I'm,
I am on the road.

1603
01:13:26,311 --> 01:13:27,144
I mean they'll all these weird places 
and started to feel like run down and 

1604
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:31,494
stuff and I wasn't,
here's another thing is I wasn't eating 

1605
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:34,373
meat for a long time and I started 
eating meat again and I feel so much 

1606
01:13:37,741 --> 01:13:38,574
stronger.
I literally would be in the green room 

1607
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:42,780
like tired.
Like I'm like,

1608
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:43,430
oh I am,
I am,

1609
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:44,263
I'm not old.
Why am I tired to before a show at 10 

1610
01:13:47,431 --> 01:13:50,400
o'clock?
And I really think I just wasn't getting

1611
01:13:50,401 --> 01:13:51,234
enough protein.
I really was just like eating salads in 

1612
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:55,050
between.
I just,

1613
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:58,820
once I started kind of drifting back,
I interesting back.

1614
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,440
Were you vegetarian or Vegan?
Vegetarian.

1615
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:02,274
Well,
I would go back and forth but mostly 

1616
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:05,740
vegetarian.
So sometimes you were looking for like a

1617
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:06,930
yeah.
For a whole year.

1618
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,010
Yeah.
How'd that go?

1619
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:09,820
Um,
it's,

1620
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,000
you start talking,
you're sizing people.

1621
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:13,300
It's hard.
I got very snotty.

1622
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,180
Yeah.
I felt better than everyone.

1623
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:17,620
Like I thought I was better than 
everybody else.

1624
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,130
I,
uh,

1625
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:21,610
no,
it's very difficult thing to do.

1626
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:22,983
Yeah.
You got to really make sure that you 

1627
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:26,290
monitor your protein correctly.
Like people say,

1628
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:27,880
where do you get your protein from?
And they're like,

1629
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:29,170
what are the,
what about this gorilla?

1630
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:29,980
Listen,
bitch,

1631
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:31,270
you're not a gorilla.
Okay.

1632
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,450
You're not a fucking horse either.
Horses eat hay all day and they're fine.

1633
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,300
Have giant muscles,
right?

1634
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:38,500
Your body's different dummy.
Like people,

1635
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:39,363
people need certain amounts of protein 
and you certainly need a complex amino 

1636
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:46,900
acid profile and some proteins that 
you're getting from plants.

1637
01:14:46,901 --> 01:14:48,610
They don't have a full amino acid 
profile.

1638
01:14:48,611 --> 01:14:50,950
So if you're going to,
if you're going to go vegan and you want

1639
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:52,930
to really make sure that your diet is 
balanced,

1640
01:14:52,931 --> 01:14:57,490
you got to really do some reading.
Really pay attention to what I was good.

1641
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:59,770
Chemo was really good.
Hemp is one of the best.

1642
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,521
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1643
01:15:00,521 --> 01:15:02,830
Hemp protein.
There's some stuff that we sell it on it

1644
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:03,664
called hemp force protein powder and 
it's one of the best ones because it's 

1645
01:15:06,191 --> 01:15:08,760
super easy to digest a very fine 
proteins.

1646
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:12,860
It's a really expensive because I have 
to get it from fucking Canada.

1647
01:15:12,861 --> 01:15:16,840
And it's one of the goofiest laws that 
we have going today in this country that

1648
01:15:16,841 --> 01:15:19,570
you can't grow hemp still.
Yeah,

1649
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:20,523
well some states are allowing it now and
it's eventually going to roll out and 

1650
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:25,390
it's going to be nationwide.
But it's,

1651
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:29,410
it's one of the easiest things to grow.
It was like bamboo grows crazy.

1652
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:34,480
It doesn't require nearly the amount of 
a service that other plants do.

1653
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:36,520
It's essentially it's a weed.
But,

1654
01:15:36,521 --> 01:15:37,540
um,
anyway,

1655
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:40,240
the point is it's a full amino acid 
profile profile.

1656
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:41,133
Right.
And there's only a few plants that are 

1657
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:44,140
like that.
And then what other ones?

1658
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:45,123
I just couple.

1659
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,800
In all honesty,
I uh,

1660
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:49,700
I was doing it for health.
I was doing it cause I have a lot of,

1661
01:15:49,701 --> 01:15:50,534
uh,
high cholesterol and heart stuff and my 

1662
01:15:51,501 --> 01:15:52,670
family.
And I was like,

1663
01:15:52,730 --> 01:15:54,650
I didn't want to go on any drugs.
And I was like,

1664
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:56,780
I'm just going to keep it at bay and I'm
going to eat clean.

1665
01:15:56,781 --> 01:16:00,560
And I ate that way for a long time.
And eventually just this last year,

1666
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:03,590
my genetics kind of caught up to me and 
it was like,

1667
01:16:03,591 --> 01:16:06,740
I'm eating this way and I still,
my cholesterol was high,

1668
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:08,870
so I was like,
you know what,

1669
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:10,670
I'm not going to go on a stat and then 
lower it.

1670
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:14,420
Yeah.
And a exercise I exercise.

1671
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:16,520
What do you do?
I run and weights.

1672
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,890
The reason why I ask this is Anthony 
Bordain was on status and he got on stat

1673
01:16:20,891 --> 01:16:23,700
and it's just because his body was,
um,

1674
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,361
um,
he was,

1675
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:26,194
you know,
constantly going on the road and 

1676
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:28,203
traveling and drinking and eating food 
and his body wasn't responding well to 

1677
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:33,700
that.
He had real problems with blood pressure

1678
01:16:33,701 --> 01:16:34,840
and just decided,
well,

1679
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:38,980
I can either restrict my diet,
which to him is offensive,

1680
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,033
you know,
because he's a chef and it's a big part 

1681
01:16:41,741 --> 01:16:43,750
of his thing.
And especially with his job,

1682
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:46,600
he wants to get on the stat.
And so he got on the standards,

1683
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:49,770
but then he got into Jujitsu,
got obsessed with Jujitsu,

1684
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:52,030
lost 30 pounds,
got off the statens.

1685
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,290
Yeah.
Now he's super healthy.

1686
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:55,020
Well that's the thing.
I was,

1687
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:58,710
I had high cholesterol and I said,
I'm not going to go on the statens.

1688
01:16:58,920 --> 01:16:59,753
So increased how I was working out.
I went Vegan for a long time and a 

1689
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:05,993
lowered it.
I was able to lower it and keep it at 

1690
01:17:07,681 --> 01:17:10,760
bay doing that for a,
and he just started inching up,

1691
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:14,750
starting to kind of coming back and uh,
I don't know.

1692
01:17:14,751 --> 01:17:17,220
So I just figured it's the 21st century,
let me,

1693
01:17:17,221 --> 01:17:18,054
and let me embrace the technology.
But there is a negative consequences 

1694
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:23,240
with your liver,
isn't that correct?

1695
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:25,100
Well,
you have to be tested.

1696
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:26,880
You have to be,
you have to stay on top of,

1697
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,120
you got to do your blood work or is that
an issue?

1698
01:17:29,121 --> 01:17:30,770
I've only been on it for a couple 
months,

1699
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:32,870
mostly just randomly went on it.
Brand new.

1700
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:37,910
Now have you ever thought about cutting 
bread out and pasta and sugar?

1701
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:39,013
Yes.
I've thought about it and I didn't like 

1702
01:17:42,021 --> 01:17:43,700
what I was thinking while you eating a 
sandwich.

1703
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:46,610
Imagine if I couldn't have this.

1704
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:50,700
The bread thing is really new,
like I wasn't eating a lot of red.

1705
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:55,910
This is pretty new and I do love it.
The problem honestly is I grew up,

1706
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,970
food is a celebration.
Food as a way to unite people.

1707
01:17:59,971 --> 01:18:01,770
Food.
It was a big Italian family.

1708
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:04,560
Pasta was a part of it.
And uh,

1709
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:08,090
I was like at eating as a Vegan.
I walked into who?

1710
01:18:08,091 --> 01:18:08,924
A Italian grocer in Burbank and the 
Salamis and the pursuit or hanging from 

1711
01:18:14,821 --> 01:18:15,654
the ceiling next to the provolone and 
there's pastas and there's breads and 

1712
01:18:19,321 --> 01:18:20,400
this gelato.
And I'm like,

1713
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:24,360
my ancestors would just pummel me in 
the,

1714
01:18:24,361 --> 01:18:28,380
in the alley if I was like,
I'm not eating this because I'm a Vegan.

1715
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:31,140
And I'm like,
it's too much fun.

1716
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:33,800
It's too much fun to celebrate and live 
life and do the,

1717
01:18:33,801 --> 01:18:36,660
so if I could just do that once in a 
while,

1718
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:37,823
I can't say I'm going to be a vegan and 
not eat that stuff for the rest of my 

1719
01:18:40,741 --> 01:18:41,080
life.

1720
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,620
Not going to do it.
Um,

1721
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:45,740
of all the people that have ever 
suggested healthy diets too,

1722
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:50,770
no one looked at me more disgusted and 
Artie Lange when already was in here and

1723
01:18:51,831 --> 01:18:52,980
he was talking to him about his,
yeah,

1724
01:18:52,981 --> 01:18:53,814
I gotta lose weight and he's talking 
about this and I was talking to him 

1725
01:18:56,451 --> 01:18:59,490
about cutting off pastas and breads and 
all this,

1726
01:18:59,491 --> 01:19:01,700
and he looked at me like,
what the fuck are you saying?

1727
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,220
He's like,
he was like offended.

1728
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:06,200
Yeah.
Like in his eyes,

1729
01:19:06,201 --> 01:19:07,034
somehow or another he is going to 
eventually figure out how to lose all 

1730
01:19:10,701 --> 01:19:15,410
this weight without changing God damn 
thing about his lifestyle or his diet.

1731
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:16,863
But yet,
but that kind of thinking he's also why 

1732
01:19:19,461 --> 01:19:21,470
he's so hilarious.
So funny.

1733
01:19:21,471 --> 01:19:22,880
You know,
he's just so wild.

1734
01:19:22,881 --> 01:19:23,714
Motherfucker.
While mother really devours everything 

1735
01:19:25,431 --> 01:19:26,810
around them,
including gambling,

1736
01:19:26,811 --> 01:19:28,060
you ever talk to him about gambling?

1737
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:33,140
I put 500 grand on this to when you put 
what?

1738
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,033
Hold on.
How long does it take you to make that 

1739
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:39,290
500,000
you had a $500,000

1740
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:41,150
bet.
Oh my God.

1741
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:43,580
Like I hear shit like that.
My palms start sweating.

1742
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:44,983
I am terrified of gambling because I 
know way too many people that do it and 

1743
01:19:50,571 --> 01:19:52,130
rich people.
Oh yeah.

1744
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,010
I know my friend Dana White,
who was the president of the UFC,

1745
01:19:55,011 --> 01:19:55,844
he's rich and he will gamble and he's 
lost as much as a million dollars in a 

1746
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:00,943
night.
Wow.

1747
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,500
Fuck that.
$1 million.

1748
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,940
I wouldn't be able to sleep for a month.
No Way.

1749
01:20:05,941 --> 01:20:08,190
Getting the fuck out.
That'd be freaking

1750
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,120
the fuck out.
It'd be like,

1751
01:20:09,121 --> 01:20:11,370
what am I doing?
Like what's wrong with me?

1752
01:20:11,371 --> 01:20:12,870
Yeah.
Well why is that worth it?

1753
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,820
Like we won 7,000,001
night.

1754
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:17,820
What exactly?
7 million.

1755
01:20:17,821 --> 01:20:20,790
7 million won it in one night.
I wonder if what?

1756
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
How different the rushes winning $500 to
$7 million way different Tom Papa.

1757
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:30,570
Really?
6 million.

1758
01:20:30,571 --> 01:20:35,180
995,000
can you go up to the,

1759
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:37,800
can you go up to the guy like,
I want it now.

1760
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,110
I'd like to take this with me now.

1761
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:42,050
Well,
they don't like to pay you,

1762
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,093
right?
Um,

1763
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:46,410
because like they like to keep it in the
casino and million.

1764
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:50,150
They paid him in garbage bags.
They wanted to give him cash.

1765
01:20:50,151 --> 01:20:53,300
They didn't even give him a bag.
He had to go and get garbage bags.

1766
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:54,253
So they came back with those fucking 
black hefty bags and they stuff $7 

1767
01:20:58,610 --> 01:21:01,460
million in hefty bags and then left the 
casino.

1768
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:02,413
It said,
take it if you want it when you have $7 

1769
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,230
million in garbage bags and you're 
leaving,

1770
01:21:06,231 --> 01:21:07,064
you're like

1771
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,410
a small child with a sandwich walking 
through a room full of wolves.

1772
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:15,620
It's like maybe you'll make it to the 
door.

1773
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,250
Have these roles is just not going to 
listen.

1774
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,370
Like,
gee,

1775
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:23,660
how many bags would that be?
I don't know.

1776
01:21:23,661 --> 01:21:26,350
If it's hundred dollar bills,
which I assume it is right there.

1777
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,040
I know there are $1,000
bills.

1778
01:21:28,041 --> 01:21:29,750
Correct?
Have you ever seen one?

1779
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:30,740
No.
I wonder who's on it.

1780
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:33,260
Your mother.
Oh,

1781
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:36,650
hey,
mama is a $5,000

1782
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:38,930
there's a $500 bill.
Oh really?

1783
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:41,540
Recently sold.
Someone hit it to trump and he signed it

1784
01:21:41,541 --> 01:21:42,320
or some shit.
Like,

1785
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,340
really?
Huh?

1786
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:47,060
Do you feel like you're deprived when 
you eat this way?

1787
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:49,010
No.
You don't feel deprived of anything?

1788
01:21:49,011 --> 01:21:50,240
No,
because nobody can seem

1789
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:53,970
benefits are extreme.
Like physically I feel great.

1790
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:56,870
So this is like the stuff that I just 
drank the stuff in front of you.

1791
01:21:57,330 --> 01:22:00,510
This is a exogenous ketones because,
uh,

1792
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:03,390
my body's essentially in a ketogenic 
state.

1793
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,910
So I take this mineral and amino acid 
supplement.

1794
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,910
It's called key genics.
What's a ketogenic state?

1795
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:09,923
Ketogenic state means your body's 
burning fat as opposed to burning 

1796
01:22:12,121 --> 01:22:17,070
carbohydrates.
And one way to manipulate that state and

1797
01:22:17,071 --> 01:22:19,230
to make sure that your body stays cute.
Kid Keyed.

1798
01:22:19,231 --> 01:22:23,280
Atonic Ketotonic Kita Janice Ci 
Ketogenic is,

1799
01:22:23,281 --> 01:22:24,114
um,
you take exogenous ketones and this 

1800
01:22:25,981 --> 01:22:29,820
stuff allows your body to go back into a
state of Ketosis,

1801
01:22:29,821 --> 01:22:34,650
which means it's primarily using fat as 
fuel versus using.

1802
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:36,270
Meanwhile,
people right now are going,

1803
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:36,680
will

1804
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:41,680
you stop fucking talking about Jesus 
Christ?

1805
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,350
I'm interested.
Screws pop abroad folks.

1806
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:47,640
I wouldn't have said it.
You all right?

1807
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:48,650
Nothing happened.
We're good.

1808
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:49,910
No.
Um,

1809
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,560
I,
I,

1810
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:55,060
I'd like to eat lean.
I'd like to cut some of that stuff.

1811
01:22:55,120 --> 01:23:00,050
I don't eat that much bread shit buddy.
I'll do it.

1812
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:02,090
You and Artie Lange get together and 
come up with a diary.

1813
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:05,210
I'll do it called the make-believe diet 
plan.

1814
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,040
Let's make believe

1815
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,480
one day we're going to do something 
different.

1816
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:09,043
I don't feel different because I still 
eat like really healthy and really 

1817
01:23:12,371 --> 01:23:14,530
delicious foods.
How's this different from Atkins?

1818
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:16,263
Atkins is mostly protein and the problem
when that is in does kind of put you in 

1819
01:23:20,201 --> 01:23:23,710
a state of ketosis but that's not really
what your body wants.

1820
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:24,573
Apparently your body wants more fats 
than it does protein and there's huge 

1821
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:28,960
fattier.
Yeah,

1822
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,690
but what I'm eating is like a lot of 
Avocados,

1823
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:34,660
a lot of coconut oil and a lot of things
along those lines.

1824
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:38,470
Almond butter and when you eat a lot of 
nuts and things like you're getting fats

1825
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:42,490
that are healthy oils and fats that your
body processes really well.

1826
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:43,893
The biggest benefit,
and this is something that my friend 

1827
01:23:45,791 --> 01:23:48,940
Denny had said to me,
and this is thing I recognize too,

1828
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:52,300
is cognitive.
Like I'm more awake really the day.

1829
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,133
Yeah.
And I don't like the way I am right now 

1830
01:23:55,691 --> 01:23:56,320
here at,
uh,

1831
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,153
1220.
I'll be like this at seven o'clock at 

1832
01:23:58,391 --> 01:24:00,850
night.
It's even through the day.

1833
01:24:00,851 --> 01:24:03,960
I was never even before man crash in the
afternoon,

1834
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:04,803
I'd have these fucking meals.
Then I want to take a nap that's not 

1835
01:24:07,631 --> 01:24:09,250
there anymore.
So after I eat,

1836
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:10,143
when I eat,
like what I normally eat is like salads 

1837
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:16,300
with avocado and some sort of piece of 
protein,

1838
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:20,020
whether a piece of fish or chicken or 
something like that or meet when I'd eat

1839
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:21,730
like that,
I don't get tired.

1840
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:22,780
Right.
It's just,

1841
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:24,520
it's my body's telling me like,
look,

1842
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:27,430
this is way more efficient.
It's way better for us.

1843
01:24:27,431 --> 01:24:30,430
And it's not like I'm eating fucking 
cardboard and Tofu.

1844
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:32,220
It's delicious food.
Yeah.

1845
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:33,910
It's just no bread,
no pasta.

1846
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:34,893
And what about your family?
They would ever the fuck they want two 

1847
01:24:37,441 --> 01:24:37,620
weeks.

1848
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:39,800
Sit down and eat dinner with them.
Yeah,

1849
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:42,160
they do.
Well,

1850
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:43,720
I just eat different stuff.
Like,

1851
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:44,880
um,
one of the things that eat,

1852
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:47,320
if we have pasta,
I eat squash,

1853
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:49,060
I take squash,
Zucchini,

1854
01:24:49,061 --> 01:24:49,990
squash,
right.

1855
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,410
And I run it through this machines,
like this thing that spins,

1856
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:58,090
he cranked this handle and it Toros this
Zucchini through this cutter,

1857
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:58,953
right?
That makes these little swirly pasta 

1858
01:25:00,521 --> 01:25:03,580
like noodle things.
And then I put spaghetti sauce on that.

1859
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:04,420
Really?
Yeah.

1860
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:05,320
Yeah.
And your kids are like,

1861
01:25:05,321 --> 01:25:06,370
Dad,
what are you doing?

1862
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,140
They don't mind.
They even eat some of it.

1863
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,740
They're used to it.
My kids have eaten everything.

1864
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:12,280
Right.
That's,

1865
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:13,540
that's exactly what it is.
Oh,

1866
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:14,770
that's right from my,
my page.

1867
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:16,420
Um,
that's the,

1868
01:25:16,421 --> 01:25:18,670
uh,
see it twirls and into those noodles.

1869
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:22,300
And then that's a ground venison.
So Joe,

1870
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,553
if you had,
if you eat like this and then that one 

1871
01:25:25,931 --> 01:25:28,300
meal you had pasta,
does that blow the whole thing?

1872
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:29,131
No,
no,

1873
01:25:29,131 --> 01:25:29,441
no,
no.

1874
01:25:29,441 --> 01:25:32,230
But it puts you out of,
it knocks you out of Ketosis.

1875
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:34,540
But this stuff right here and knocks you
right back in.

1876
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:35,613
So like even you could have like a 
syrupy glass of soda and then have this 

1877
01:25:39,491 --> 01:25:41,550
stuff and it'll put you right back into 
ketosis.

1878
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:48,440
It's just manipulating the way your body
processes fuel.

1879
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:52,240
Right.
And I just find just for me that when my

1880
01:25:52,241 --> 01:25:54,640
boss and not just me like Shaw Brennan 
Chubb,

1881
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:58,030
my buddy who got on in a few months ago,
two months ago,

1882
01:25:58,031 --> 01:26:00,190
something like that,
he's lost a shitload of way.

1883
01:26:00,191 --> 01:26:01,024
He looks great.
Everybody I know that's done it loves 

1884
01:26:02,351 --> 01:26:03,170
it.
Really?

1885
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,003
Yeah.
I just don't think that your body's 

1886
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,850
meant to eat that much sugar in that 
many process.

1887
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:09,590
Carbohydrates.
I just don't think it is.

1888
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:10,480
No,
they're not.

1889
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,080
I'm going to do it.
You can do it.

1890
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:14,900
That's even like with this bread,
it's like,

1891
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,030
you know,
that was the only thing that you would,

1892
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,770
that would be the carb that you would 
eat.

1893
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:20,750
You know what I mean?
You would have a little b.

1894
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,240
The percentage in your diet was so 
small.

1895
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:23,990
Right.
You know,

1896
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:28,390
then you were eating vegetables,
you're eating meats and fish and nuts,

1897
01:26:28,810 --> 01:26:31,960
salads,
folks eat some fucking salad.

1898
01:26:31,961 --> 01:26:32,794
It's so important.
That's one of the things that drives me 

1899
01:26:34,271 --> 01:26:36,500
the most crazy about vegans.
Um,

1900
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:39,310
one of the things is they'll assume that
you don't eat what they do.

1901
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:40,330
Eat.
Like,

1902
01:26:40,331 --> 01:26:41,120
you know,
like Vegans,

1903
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:41,953
like that guy was like telling me like,
I'm eating all these vegetables and I'm 

1904
01:26:45,101 --> 01:26:46,780
getting all these nutrients and you're 
not.

1905
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:47,614
I go,
well actually I am because I mean all 

1906
01:26:48,761 --> 01:26:50,050
those vegetables too,
right,

1907
01:26:50,051 --> 01:26:51,640
but also have steak,
right?

1908
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,370
Like what the fuck are you to like this 
idea that they're mutually exclusive.

1909
01:26:54,371 --> 01:26:55,720
It's so stupid.
Like,

1910
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,790
yeah,
you definitely should have vegetables.

1911
01:26:57,791 --> 01:27:01,060
Everyone should eat vegetables.
But the idea that you shouldn't eat meat

1912
01:27:01,061 --> 01:27:01,894
because we're not designed for meat,
that who comes like an ideological 

1913
01:27:04,361 --> 01:27:06,460
argument.
Then they start saying things like,

1914
01:27:06,461 --> 01:27:08,650
you know,
like the body was not designed for that.

1915
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:10,450
Human beings are herbivores.
No,

1916
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,530
no,
actually we're not.

1917
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:13,660
It's not only that,
it's proof positive.

1918
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:18,250
It's been proven that one of the main 
reasons why the human brain got large is

1919
01:27:18,251 --> 01:27:19,990
because of meat consumption,
right?

1920
01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:22,300
Yeah.
I mean there's the monkeys figured out,

1921
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:23,490
look,
there's,

1922
01:27:23,491 --> 01:27:26,100
there's better protein out there.
I started eating some,

1923
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:28,660
whatever the fuck they did.
What did they

1924
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:29,641
do?
You see?

1925
01:27:29,641 --> 01:27:33,830
They just found this walt whitman guide.
Someone found it in a,

1926
01:27:33,831 --> 01:27:35,070
uh,
in a library.

1927
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:36,403
It was like this finding of a Walt 
Whitman stuff that he wrote that people 

1928
01:27:39,811 --> 01:27:40,920
hadn't seen before.
So they got excited.

1929
01:27:40,921 --> 01:27:43,590
It was about health.
It was about uh,

1930
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:44,693
a guide to being a healthy man or 
something in the first thing was eat 

1931
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:50,430
meat.
Of course that was his first thing.

1932
01:27:50,730 --> 01:27:52,800
Well that's what people thought back 
then.

1933
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:54,120
Yeah,
I mean it was,

1934
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:55,100
there was

1935
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:57,860
super important.
Did you see that thing recently?

1936
01:27:58,460 --> 01:27:59,293
They discovered the remains of a 
mastodon that had been slaughtered by 

1937
01:28:03,861 --> 01:28:04,694
people in,
I think they found it in Florida in a 

1938
01:28:08,001 --> 01:28:11,930
bog or something like that or sink hole 
and it was 14,000

1939
01:28:11,931 --> 01:28:12,764
years old.
So it threw a monkey wrench into the 

1940
01:28:14,631 --> 01:28:15,464
timeline of people being in North 
America because it pushed it back by 

1941
01:28:19,941 --> 01:28:20,774
1500 years.
So it's like a new mystery as far like 

1942
01:28:25,731 --> 01:28:26,564
they've really just,
there's a lot of just ramping 

1943
01:28:28,671 --> 01:28:31,250
speculation once you get past a couple 
of thousand years ago,

1944
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:33,470
they're like,
who the fuck knows this?

1945
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:34,550
There's like,
yeah,

1946
01:28:34,551 --> 01:28:37,490
there's current theories and they try to
work on them and they try to,

1947
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:41,390
you know,
that they're trying to decipher the past

1948
01:28:41,391 --> 01:28:42,224
based on these little small clues that 
they dig up here and there and 

1949
01:28:45,591 --> 01:28:47,750
occasionally they dig up a new clue and 
they just go,

1950
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:48,470
whoa.

1951
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:50,030
Okay.
All right everybody,

1952
01:28:50,031 --> 01:28:50,864
let's get together.
Let's get together because we'd just 

1953
01:28:52,221 --> 01:28:53,054
fucked our timeline.
We've got to go back and rewrite the 

1954
01:28:55,491 --> 01:28:56,650
whole timeline.
Yeah.

1955
01:28:56,690 --> 01:28:58,670
It's pretty cool looking though.
There it is.

1956
01:28:58,671 --> 01:29:01,100
Yeah.
They pulled it out and um,

1957
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,633
a stone knife,
mastodon bones and a fossilized dung 

1958
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,190
found in an underwater case.
Scroll that down please.

1959
01:29:08,191 --> 01:29:09,024
Young Jamie.
A underwater sinkhole shows that humans 

1960
01:29:11,701 --> 01:29:15,090
lived in north Florida about 14,500
years ago.

1961
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:15,924
According to new research suggests the 
colonization of the Americas was far 

1962
01:29:18,871 --> 01:29:19,704
more complex than originally believed.
I love stuff like this cool learning 

1963
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:24,583
about mystery culture.
I'm just unbelievably fascinated by the 

1964
01:29:28,411 --> 01:29:31,440
idea that people lived like us.
They were,

1965
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:32,363
they were like us 14,000
years ago and they lived is crazy 

1966
01:29:35,761 --> 01:29:39,810
existences where they were just hanging 
together in these little tribes and they

1967
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:40,703
relied on each other deeply and right.
And that was the only way you could 

1968
01:29:43,621 --> 01:29:44,040
survive.

1969
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:44,873
You had to get in these small groups of 
like 50 people and everybody stuck 

1970
01:29:47,401 --> 01:29:48,234
together,
had to gather food and everybody had a 

1971
01:29:50,761 --> 01:29:52,770
responsibility.
And you know,

1972
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:53,633
there's a direct connection between 
social behaviors today and a hunter 

1973
01:29:57,181 --> 01:29:58,650
gatherer,
um,

1974
01:29:58,651 --> 01:30:01,320
needs thousands and thousand,
excuse me,

1975
01:30:01,321 --> 01:30:02,154
thousands and thousands of years ago.
Like the reason why women are so 

1976
01:30:03,991 --> 01:30:04,824
talkative and social and men prefer like
people being more stoic and men don't 

1977
01:30:09,391 --> 01:30:12,870
like when men talk too much because 
those men would fuck up hunting trips.

1978
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:14,040
Oh really?
Yeah.

1979
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:14,874
I mean if you were out there hunting in 
those and the women would get together 

1980
01:30:17,551 --> 01:30:18,384
and when women were gatherers,
women's jobs were equally as hard as 

1981
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:22,014
men,
if not harder because they were in 

1982
01:30:22,831 --> 01:30:23,664
charge of farming like the men would 
wear or gathering at least vegetables 

1983
01:30:27,481 --> 01:30:30,240
and foods that you could find.
And then we'd go out and hunt hunt.

1984
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:31,103
So the hunters learned how to prize 
being stealthy and quiet and keeping 

1985
01:30:36,121 --> 01:30:38,850
your shit together under pressure called
cool.

1986
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,710
Yeah,
keeping your sh they're cool together.

1987
01:30:40,711 --> 01:30:41,544
When you're sneaking up on an animal and
all your nerves are firing in your 

1988
01:30:44,881 --> 01:30:45,714
brain,
you have to execute a shot or throw a 

1989
01:30:47,671 --> 01:30:50,730
spear and you have to get the job done.
Whereas women,

1990
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:54,480
they get together and they start talking
about this one and that one and she says

1991
01:30:54,481 --> 01:30:57,720
this and I'm not picking the vegetables 
sitting there by the river,

1992
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,250
avoiding crocodiles,
washing underwear going,

1993
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:01,093
that's fucking bitch thinks that she's 
going to take mom or does your husband 

1994
01:31:04,321 --> 01:31:05,154
come back from a Heinz and not talk?
I mean how can you be out for a whole 

1995
01:31:07,051 --> 01:31:08,690
hunt and have nothing to say when you 
come up.

1996
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:09,900
My God,
I come home and I'm just Yap,

1997
01:31:09,901 --> 01:31:10,171
Yap,
Yap,

1998
01:31:10,171 --> 01:31:10,441
Yap,
Yap,

1999
01:31:10,441 --> 01:31:10,711
Yap,
Yap,

2000
01:31:10,711 --> 01:31:11,041
Yap,
Yap.

2001
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:11,970
And he's like,
will you shut the fuck up?

2002
01:31:11,971 --> 01:31:14,440
I think I heard a stink snap stick.

2003
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:15,293
Snap.
There's,

2004
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:18,780
there's a line in the bushes,
honey.

2005
01:31:18,781 --> 01:31:20,790
I just got home.
I've been out hunting all day.

2006
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:22,710
Just give me a minute before we start 
talking.

2007
01:31:23,130 --> 01:31:24,650
I was watching this thing,
um,

2008
01:31:24,690 --> 01:31:29,490
the other night about the Mussai,
the Mussai warriors and I'm there mostly

2009
01:31:29,491 --> 01:31:30,211
herders,
you know,

2010
01:31:30,211 --> 01:31:31,044
they have all these cattle and it was 
really crazy because they had like 10 

2011
01:31:33,301 --> 01:31:38,220
year old kids helping out like these 10 
year old kids are herding cattle and uh,

2012
01:31:38,221 --> 01:31:40,410
you know,
they're just doing jobs to work,

2013
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:41,413
get to work.
Yeah.

2014
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:42,383
10 and I'm,
one of the things they had this village 

2015
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,990
that is in the middle of this incredibly
wild area.

2016
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:49,853
I mean,
there are surrounded by buffaloes and 

2017
01:31:51,811 --> 01:31:56,670
lions and all around their village.
This is a very small little village,

2018
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:59,040
which is really an extended family.
It's like the,

2019
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,903
and the fathers and their families and 
brothers and sisters and their families 

2020
01:32:04,271 --> 01:32:05,104
and everyone lives together in this one 
little extended village with all their 

2021
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:10,120
livestock,
but all around they're tiny village.

2022
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:13,900
They had thorn bushes placed to keep 
lions out.

2023
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:15,633
That's their fence.
The fence is just making it 

2024
01:32:18,401 --> 01:32:21,880
uncomfortable for lions to move in and 
killed them with cheese.

2025
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:23,920
So fucked man.
It was watching it.

2026
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:26,080
And apparently that's not their biggest 
danger.

2027
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:27,880
Their biggest dangers.
Buffalo.

2028
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,740
Oh yeah,
the air man.

2029
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,870
Those,
those fucking Cape Buffalo,

2030
01:32:31,871 --> 01:32:33,750
I guess it is.
I don't know which buffalo there's,

2031
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,570
that's what they look like.
Yeah.

2032
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:39,370
On the buffalo now that's a baby.
That's a little tiny person.

2033
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:42,650
Little tiny Mussai person.
Their buffalo are so weird there.

2034
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:48,030
They look like they were close.
You have a row walking around naked.

2035
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:50,013
It's cute,
cute little [inaudible] and they're 

2036
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:52,570
still survived today.
There's still assign.

2037
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:53,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

2038
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:54,484
So see those,
those bushes that they have set up like 

2039
01:32:55,781 --> 01:32:56,614
that,
that's how they keep the lines out and 

2040
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,870
they just make it uncomfortable for 
them.

2041
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:03,160
They set up these smart parameters or 
perimeters rather around their house.

2042
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:04,533
But the Buffalo,
I guess it's a Cape Buffalo or water 

2043
01:33:07,871 --> 01:33:12,871
buffalo or one of the buffaloes wa 
Tanzania look up dangerous buffets.

2044
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:15,933
Tanzania.
When are you going to Tanzania and the 

2045
01:33:17,441 --> 01:33:19,450
August dude,
I'm thinking about going in August.

2046
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:20,313
Are you really?
I'm thinking about going on the safari 

2047
01:33:21,461 --> 01:33:24,610
with the family log on fifth through the
16th what are you doing?

2048
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:25,803
Um,
I know a guy that runs these resorts 

2049
01:33:27,161 --> 01:33:30,010
there and you're going to go safari,
the family.

2050
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:32,130
Oh Shit,
Papa.

2051
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:35,650
Maybe we'll be there at the same time.
We'll ignore each other though.

2052
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:38,750
We can pretend we can meet.
We can meet in.

2053
01:33:38,751 --> 01:33:39,584
Pretend we're hunting for like a minute.
I gotta go back to my woman stuff for 

2054
01:33:42,101 --> 01:33:46,210
bread.
What if they don't have bread?

2055
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:48,130
Do you it right?
Yeah.

2056
01:33:48,131 --> 01:33:49,540
You gotta tell me where you're going.
Yeah.

2057
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:50,374
We haven't decided yet.
We were deciding on a family trip to 

2058
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:55,630
summer and then delete it.
Be Europe or Africa.

2059
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,020
Those are the two potential destinations
now and I haven't really,

2060
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,120
I don't know.
Wouldn't it be cool?

2061
01:34:01,121 --> 01:34:01,954
This is mine.
I'm thinking I never really had a real 

2062
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:03,874
draw to Africa,
but the idea that I could get my 

2063
01:34:05,351 --> 01:34:08,380
children to Africa,
it feels like a good thing.

2064
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:09,730
I think those are willdabeast Jamie,

2065
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:14,400
son of a bitch on those right down 
there.

2066
01:34:14,401 --> 01:34:15,990
That one right there.
See that one right down there?

2067
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,480
That guy is right in front of,
I guess that's a dead one,

2068
01:34:18,481 --> 01:34:19,680
Huh?
What is that?

2069
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:23,130
That's some sort of a buffalo,
right?

2070
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,390
Yeah,
yeah.

2071
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:26,760
That's a giant ass buffalo.
Yeah,

2072
01:34:26,761 --> 01:34:29,010
that's an enormous,
well those things,

2073
01:34:29,011 --> 01:34:31,500
apparently those buffaloes that they 
have in,

2074
01:34:31,501 --> 01:34:33,330
um,
just find out what kind of buffalo,

2075
01:34:33,331 --> 01:34:37,270
because I keep saying buffalo.
There's a,

2076
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:39,570
there's a name.
Um,

2077
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,433
but those,
those things apparently are the most 

2078
01:34:41,701 --> 01:34:42,970
dangerous thing in Africa.
Oh,

2079
01:34:42,971 --> 01:34:43,920
really?
Next to hippos.

2080
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:47,130
Hippos are the most dangerous hippos.
Cape Buffalo or African Buffalo.

2081
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:48,720
Okay,
so I was kind of right.

2082
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:50,063
But those fuckers,
when I was watching the show on the 

2083
01:34:52,201 --> 01:34:53,034
Mussai one,
one of the ladies had gone to get water 

2084
01:34:56,221 --> 01:34:58,100
and she got jacked by Buffalo.
Really?

2085
01:34:58,110 --> 01:34:59,420
They just do to close.
They go,

2086
01:34:59,421 --> 01:35:01,400
fuck you.
And they just run out here.

2087
01:35:01,401 --> 01:35:02,810
They're like,
think of a bowl.

2088
01:35:02,811 --> 01:35:05,090
Like how mean bowls are fast.
Yeah.

2089
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:06,980
I mean bull riders,
I mean,

2090
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:09,880
those bowls or just a fuck you kicking 
them off the gray.

2091
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,450
I mean,
that's what these God damn things are.

2092
01:35:11,451 --> 01:35:13,160
But Times 10.
Oh man,

2093
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:15,860
they're enormous about the hyenas.
That's what I'm worried about.

2094
01:35:15,861 --> 01:35:17,660
Dairy too.
Those things are evil.

2095
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:20,130
They're all scary.
They're mean.

2096
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:21,403
You know,
hyenas are one of the few animals where 

2097
01:35:24,321 --> 01:35:25,154
the female is larger than the male to 
keep the mail from eating the babies 

2098
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:29,430
railing,
you know?

2099
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,033
Oh,
they don't give a shit to so main and 

2100
01:35:32,971 --> 01:35:34,640
their jaws are super strong.
Yeah,

2101
01:35:34,641 --> 01:35:36,980
like some of the strongest bites in the 
world.

2102
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:40,180
I think only thing stronger.
It's like crocodiles on the safari.

2103
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:42,800
Things you can't go out like you can't 
go to the bathroom at night.

2104
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:44,600
Is this the buffaloes?
Unless you have an arm,

2105
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:45,860
you can read that.
What does it say,

2106
01:35:45,861 --> 01:35:48,260
buddy?
Oh,

2107
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:51,200
okay.
Other than the big five,

2108
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:52,063
it is known as the black death or widow 
maker and is widely regarded as a very 

2109
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:58,370
dangerous animal.
It whoa.

2110
01:35:58,371 --> 01:36:01,010
It Gores and kills over 200 people every
year.

2111
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:05,360
Jesus Christ buffaloes are sometimes 
reported to kill people in Africa.

2112
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,570
Kill more people in Africa than any 
other animal.

2113
01:36:08,890 --> 01:36:11,090
You have a look at that picture of 
Hemingway?

2114
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,193
He just killed that fellow.
Some of the kink claims are made by 

2115
01:36:13,941 --> 01:36:15,110
hippos and crocodiles.
My,

2116
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,910
yeah,
you mean you can definitely kill them.

2117
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,020
I'm totally killing it.

2118
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:21,860
They don't taste good though.
My,

2119
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:24,470
my problem would be with one of those 
things.

2120
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,960
Well,
you can absolutely eat buffalo.

2121
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:29,450
Like a buddy of mine shot one with a bow
and Arrow,

2122
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:30,284
but he said he was practicing with his 
bone out for a half an hour while 

2123
01:36:33,291 --> 01:36:36,020
chewing one piece of meat.
Oh really?

2124
01:36:36,021 --> 01:36:37,010
Yeah.
Like literally.

2125
01:36:37,011 --> 01:36:40,760
It's so tough.
I had buffalo this winter from,

2126
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:42,980
uh,
yet bios don't area.

2127
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:43,880
Oh,
that bison.

2128
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:44,773
Yeah,
that was good.

2129
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:45,740
Oh,
that's delicious.

2130
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:46,603
Yeah,
that's,

2131
01:36:46,830 --> 01:36:48,050
that's a different kind of buffalo.
Well,

2132
01:36:48,051 --> 01:36:50,160
there's a real controversy and this 
isn't a good quote.

2133
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:52,730
Good thing to bring up now because I 
found out something yesterday.

2134
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:53,863
There's a big controversy that's going 
on in yellowstone because they're 

2135
01:36:56,691 --> 01:36:57,524
calling a large number of bison from 
yellowstone and these people are 

2136
01:37:02,871 --> 01:37:03,704
freaking out about it and they're 
freaking out about it from a couple 

2137
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:08,213
different sides.
But one of the reasons why they say 

2138
01:37:09,601 --> 01:37:12,290
they're killing them is because there's 
a large population of them.

2139
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:13,123
There's no hunting and yellowstone and 
these animals are traveling to outside 

2140
01:37:17,001 --> 01:37:22,001
of yellowstone and they're using the 
land that ranchers used for cattle.

2141
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:23,443
So like there's public land that 
ranchers have rights to have their 

2142
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:27,674
cattle graze on,
but then these bison are intruding into 

2143
01:37:30,591 --> 01:37:34,940
these land and they're saying that the 
bison carry Brucellosis,

2144
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:35,953
which is apparently a very dangerous 
disease for cattle because it makes 

2145
01:37:38,361 --> 01:37:39,194
their babies stillborn.
But there's no evidence apparently that 

2146
01:37:44,541 --> 01:37:49,541
brucellosis is transferred from bison to
cattle.

2147
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:50,773
See,
one of the guys that was on the twitter 

2148
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:56,040
exchange that I was having last night 
was explaining that and a,

2149
01:37:56,041 --> 01:37:56,910
and I said,
really?

2150
01:37:56,911 --> 01:37:57,271
I said,
well,

2151
01:37:57,271 --> 01:37:58,104
why are they killing these animals the 
same that they have brucellosis and 

2152
01:38:00,361 --> 01:38:02,160
they're worried about,
I'm transferring it to cattle,

2153
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:03,203
no evidence that they've done it.
So I go and look at it and apparently 

2154
01:38:05,221 --> 01:38:06,054
it's true,
apparently elk or more likely to 

2155
01:38:07,951 --> 01:38:08,784
transfer brucellosis to cattle,
but elk don't use the same grazing 

2156
01:38:12,151 --> 01:38:12,540
ground.

2157
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:13,373
They don't,
they don't graze the same way that 

2158
01:38:14,611 --> 01:38:17,400
cattle do.
So with these buffalo do is they just,

2159
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:18,473
they're competing for grazing ground and
they're using the brucellosis as an 

2160
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:22,854
excuse to slaughter them.
And so they're just going in there and 

2161
01:38:25,471 --> 01:38:26,304
shooting them and they use all the meat.
I mean they're bringing all the meat 

2162
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:29,520
too.
I mean,

2163
01:38:29,521 --> 01:38:30,354
it all becomes either gets donated to 
native Americans or they butcher it and 

2164
01:38:34,741 --> 01:38:36,800
sell it,
so you're allowed to shoot them.

2165
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:38,243
There's,
they're allowing a call of a certain 

2166
01:38:40,411 --> 01:38:43,260
amount of it,
but apparently it's hundreds of them and

2167
01:38:43,261 --> 01:38:44,094
you know people that love seeing those 
things at yellowstone or kind of 

2168
01:38:46,411 --> 01:38:50,670
freaking out because they're doing it 
because of cattle operations.

2169
01:38:50,671 --> 01:38:51,630
Really.
It's really,

2170
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:56,960
it's really a thinly disguised like 
protection of cattle land.

2171
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:58,313
It's a strange thing because you bring 
them back and they get to a certain 

2172
01:39:03,391 --> 01:39:05,640
number and then that number becomes too 
large,

2173
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:06,923
but too large for what,
two large in large for a very small 

2174
01:39:09,601 --> 01:39:10,740
area,
right?

2175
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,620
Yeah.
For the way that the humans are living.

2176
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:15,450
Like you know in New Jersey they have 
this,

2177
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:18,510
there's so many deer you want to shoot 
more deer,

2178
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:22,380
but it's because it's the most densely 
populated state in the union.

2179
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:23,640
There's just,
well,

2180
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:26,610
they don't have a predator.
That's the real problem in deer.

2181
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:27,720
Right.
With dear,

2182
01:39:27,721 --> 01:39:31,320
dear require a prey Predator balance 
that we have in California.

2183
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:34,510
Like California has a weird thing going 
on and it's,

2184
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:36,690
I like it in some ways.
In other ways I don't like it.

2185
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:37,553
One of the things that I do like it is,
and what California has done is allowed 

2186
01:39:39,721 --> 01:39:42,710
mountain lions to kill the deer.
Right?

2187
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:45,330
And you can't kill mountain lions.
So there's no,

2188
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:47,520
there's no hunting of mountain.
That's one of the few states,

2189
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:50,780
one of the few states that has a large 
healthy mountain lion population.

2190
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,860
Hunting's not,
not regulated.

2191
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:57,090
So the problem is wildlife biologists 
don't agree with that.

2192
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:58,073
Wildlife biologist thinks that you have 
to manage the numbers of mountain lions 

2193
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:02,210
just like you manage all the other 
animals.

2194
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:06,750
But on the flip side,
because you don't hunt mountain lions,

2195
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:07,613
you see very little deer.
It's very hard to find like deer 

2196
01:40:09,511 --> 01:40:10,344
hunting.
And California is diminished radically 

2197
01:40:11,611 --> 01:40:13,950
since the 1990s when they instituted 
this.

2198
01:40:13,951 --> 01:40:14,784
No mountain lion hunting.
So the mountain lions are just eating 

2199
01:40:16,711 --> 01:40:17,910
them up.
They're going like crazy.

2200
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:20,100
And there's a lot of mountain lions.
There's a lot.

2201
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:22,400
There's a friend of mine who is a um,
uh,

2202
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:27,200
he works on a ranch called to hone ranch
and to hone ranch has this one waterhole

2203
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,700
where they have a camera set up to 
photograph whatever animals in there.

2204
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:33,540
They found 16 different mountain lions 
on one waterhole.

2205
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:37,590
Choose Jesus Christ.
Really create those breezeways like over

2206
01:40:37,591 --> 01:40:39,930
the freeways and stuff.
Well they're trying to do that.

2207
01:40:39,931 --> 01:40:41,340
I don't know if they have actually done 
that.

2208
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:43,740
We actually built it where I've seen 
him.

2209
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:44,603
Uh,
I think on the way back from palm 

2210
01:40:45,361 --> 01:40:48,000
springs I didn't go on help jog and I'm 
one of those things.

2211
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:48,923
Yeah.
Have you ever seen that video of the 

2212
01:40:49,831 --> 01:40:51,900
lady in Florida?
Well she's on like a,

2213
01:40:52,130 --> 01:40:54,010
like a small bridge.
A Panther runs

2214
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,410
buyer?
No,

2215
01:40:55,470 --> 01:40:57,400
I've never seen it.
Oh my God.

2216
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,353
It is a shit.
Your pants and a half moment cause it's 

2217
01:41:01,841 --> 01:41:03,850
big man.
Really big.

2218
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:04,713
Yeah.
Both the Florida panthers and other 

2219
01:41:05,771 --> 01:41:08,860
animal that was like on the brink of 
extinction and it's the same animal.

2220
01:41:08,910 --> 01:41:12,090
It's a mountain line.
Ooma Puma Panther,

2221
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:13,240
Mountain Lion.
Same animal.

2222
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:14,680
Just different colors.
No,

2223
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:17,600
not even different colors.
This one is mount line color outfits.

2224
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:18,703
Yes.
They have different nail Polish and 

2225
01:41:19,361 --> 01:41:20,530
stuff,
but this,

2226
01:41:20,531 --> 01:41:21,610
uh,
watch this video.

2227
01:41:21,611 --> 01:41:23,350
Look at this.
This lady's on this bridge.

2228
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:24,790
Check this shit out.
It's crazy.

2229
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:27,090
We'll hear it.
Give us some volume in.

2230
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,840
Jamey.
Look at this.

2231
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:31,660
So she's hanging out.
She's walking on this bridge.

2232
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:32,471
She's like,
look,

2233
01:41:32,471 --> 01:41:33,580
everything was so pretty.

2234
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:36,240
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

2235
01:41:37,310 --> 01:41:38,143
Oh my God.

2236
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:43,933
What?
No,

2237
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:47,110
he just wasn't interested.
What?

2238
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:50,100
Thank God.
What in the first,

2239
01:41:50,101 --> 01:41:52,020
a big cat too.
Yeah.

2240
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:55,500
It's wooden bridge and the everglades,
I think it is.

2241
01:41:55,501 --> 01:41:56,334
Yeah.

2242
01:41:56,430 --> 01:41:58,160
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

2243
01:41:59,570 --> 01:42:01,490
He got scared.
He was just a scared.

2244
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:04,460
Do you see that?
This Christ you were talking about,

2245
01:42:04,461 --> 01:42:08,210
I'm out here and they showed a guy who 
was working on in someone's house?

2246
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:09,313
Yeah,
like in the Hollywood hills and the guy 

2247
01:42:11,451 --> 01:42:13,700
just comes out and he's like doing the 
plumbing or something.

2248
01:42:13,701 --> 01:42:15,040
He's like,
ah,

2249
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:15,883
there's something in there.
It's really big that just put like a 

2250
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:23,690
flashlight on this giant stick and deep 
under the house.

2251
01:42:23,691 --> 01:42:25,370
That's where that was his den.
Oh,

2252
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:26,480
mark.
This is living in,

2253
01:42:26,481 --> 01:42:28,560
they're living under his house.
Yeah.

2254
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,440
There's another video that I posted 
yesterday,

2255
01:42:30,441 --> 01:42:31,430
Jamie,
or this guy.

2256
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:36,490
We're a bear.
A fucking huge bear comes running at him

2257
01:42:37,491 --> 01:42:42,140
full clip and the guy jumps up and down 
and screamed at the top of his lungs and

2258
01:42:42,141 --> 01:42:44,720
it turns around and bolts real.
Yeah,

2259
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:45,950
but twitter.
Yeah,

2260
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:46,784
it's on my twitter.
But like last minute got like as close 

2261
01:42:51,051 --> 01:42:53,420
as Jamie is to you.
Grisly.

2262
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:55,490
Huge.
G huge.

2263
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:59,870
I mean like 700 pounds.
It is a fucking enormous.

2264
01:42:59,871 --> 01:43:01,700
This bear.
Look how big this barris like,

2265
01:43:01,701 --> 01:43:02,780
wait,
wait to see this video.

2266
01:43:02,781 --> 01:43:05,630
You're going to shit your pants.
So it goes go fullscreen Jamie.

2267
01:43:06,530 --> 01:43:08,350
It's not going full screen.
Yeah,

2268
01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:09,620
there you go.
Wait,

2269
01:43:09,620 --> 01:43:11,510
you're going to shit your pants do 
Swedish man.

2270
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:12,403
So this guy,
he sees it in the woods and it starts 

2271
01:43:14,451 --> 01:43:16,610
running up to him.
Where's the volume buddy?

2272
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:17,530
It's all wintery.

2273
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:19,850
Okay.

2274
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:22,010
Why is no sound?
It was definitely sound.

2275
01:43:22,011 --> 01:43:23,750
We got to hear the sound because the guy
screams at it.

2276
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:25,341
Hold on.
We've got to figure it out.

2277
01:43:25,341 --> 01:43:26,210
Wow.
It worked.

2278
01:43:26,211 --> 01:43:27,950
Holy Shit.
I never saw it.

2279
01:43:28,010 --> 01:43:30,680
I never even thought that would work.
Huh?

2280
01:43:32,190 --> 01:43:34,270
What's that?
Well,

2281
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:35,113
it's definitely got sound,
so let's figure it out because you've 

2282
01:43:36,741 --> 01:43:38,980
got to hear it because the guy goes,
ah,

2283
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,650
well look,
I'll put his arms out to the side.

2284
01:43:42,830 --> 01:43:45,590
Look at the size of it.
It's running at him,

2285
01:43:45,650 --> 01:43:48,090
like running at him and he was able to 
scare it.

2286
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:51,080
He reels back like he's scared.
Well he went for,

2287
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:51,620
you know,
look,

2288
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:52,453
look

2289
01:43:54,450 --> 01:43:55,730
the bears like,
Oh shit,

2290
01:43:55,970 --> 01:43:56,803
look it up.
Look how big he is and look how much 

2291
01:43:59,571 --> 01:44:01,910
bigger that thing.
It's like four times,

2292
01:44:01,911 --> 01:44:04,040
five times bigger than him.
Oh my God.

2293
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:06,830
Oh my God.
That makes me freak out.

2294
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:08,570
If he had turned and Ronnie would have 
been eating.

2295
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:10,130
Oh yeah,
for sure.

2296
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:13,490
I mean the thing ran at him like it was 
dinnertime.

2297
01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:17,720
I was that close to a bear.
Where in Alaska and Denali.

2298
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:19,050
Jesus.
A bar.

2299
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:19,970
A grizzly.
Yup.

2300
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:23,840
What the big ass grizzly.
We woke up in the morning and,

2301
01:44:23,841 --> 01:44:24,674
uh,
we were in back country for a couple of 

2302
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:29,180
weeks just hiking and walking around.
And um,

2303
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:30,763
we got,
we woke up and we were making our 

2304
01:44:32,331 --> 01:44:37,280
breakfast and we look up on a ridge and 
there's this big ass bear.

2305
01:44:37,281 --> 01:44:38,990
This is September,
so it's like late,

2306
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:39,853
you know,
it's like they were getting ready to 

2307
01:44:40,581 --> 01:44:45,581
hibernate and he's walking down the 
ridge and as we're packing up and uh,

2308
01:44:46,610 --> 01:44:48,590
you know,
you're up to the ridge is actually where

2309
01:44:48,591 --> 01:44:49,424
we were cleaning our dishes and doing 
all this stuff and now we're back at 

2310
01:44:51,981 --> 01:44:52,814
camp,
were breaking down to hike out and we 

2311
01:44:55,071 --> 01:44:57,990
see this thing go walking down and just 
dumb asses.

2312
01:44:58,010 --> 01:45:00,140
We're so lucky we didn't get eaten.
The Guy,

2313
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:01,073
uh,
uh,

2314
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:01,993
we pack up and we just start walking in 
the same direction that the bear was 

2315
01:45:06,201 --> 01:45:06,711
going,
where like,

2316
01:45:06,711 --> 01:45:09,620
he's not going to be going.
He probably has beaten us there.

2317
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:13,040
So we're walking through these,
these reads,

2318
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:14,083
these like bamboo kind of little reads,
but there were only like six feet high 

2319
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:20,540
and there's like eight of us,
maybe six of us.

2320
01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:22,123
And we're walking with our packs on and 
you just hear and you see the reeds 

2321
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,080
separating you slowly though.
Like it's not coming fast.

2322
01:45:33,081 --> 01:45:35,750
Just I'm like,
what the hell?

2323
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:36,643
That's probably the bear.
We see that it's the bear and you know 

2324
01:45:40,581 --> 01:45:41,414
you're supposed to do what that guy did 
and put your arms up or at least freeze 

2325
01:45:44,031 --> 01:45:47,240
and don't.
Everyone in the group took off.

2326
01:45:47,330 --> 01:45:48,163
That's the one that ran and all frozen 
in the pose and me and my one friend 

2327
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:58,790
like you're not supposed to do the run 
and we're in our,

2328
01:45:59,050 --> 01:46:01,910
and then they take off with their 
backpack.

2329
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:03,440
Oh my God.
But the bear,

2330
01:46:03,441 --> 01:46:04,274
thankfully just by a stroke of luck,
this thing was so fat and tired and the 

2331
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:11,540
end of September he just wanted to go 
down low,

2332
01:46:11,541 --> 01:46:16,541
get some more berries and just take a 
snooze was not interested in us at all.

2333
01:46:16,761 --> 01:46:18,920
He was just so lucky,
so lucky.

2334
01:46:18,921 --> 01:46:22,340
But I swear to God it was from me to the
end of this table.

2335
01:46:22,610 --> 01:46:24,950
Yet.
When they're gathering up berries,

2336
01:46:24,951 --> 01:46:25,784
that's when your safest,
they get in their head that that's what 

2337
01:46:27,621 --> 01:46:29,090
they want to eat and eat a lot of 
berries,

2338
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:30,150
right?
Oh,

2339
01:46:30,151 --> 01:46:30,984
he did not.
He was not interested to fuck all of 

2340
01:46:33,521 --> 01:46:35,520
that.
So close animals.

2341
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:38,870
I said No.
I mean,

2342
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,180
I love the the there.
I think it's cool,

2343
01:46:41,181 --> 01:46:42,860
but God dammit,
they scare the shit out of me.

2344
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:43,933
He's a a video of these guys.
They're hanging out by this river and 

2345
01:46:46,551 --> 01:46:49,920
they have like a little lawn chair and 
this bear is enormous.

2346
01:46:49,921 --> 01:46:50,250
Grizzly

2347
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:53,010
bear just walks up and sits down next to
them.

2348
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:56,850
Have you seen that one Jamie?
Close encounter with grit?

2349
01:46:56,851 --> 01:47:01,680
Grizzly bear casually walks up to people
and they just had a talk to them.

2350
01:47:01,681 --> 01:47:02,191
They're like,
hey man,

2351
01:47:02,191 --> 01:47:04,080
get the fuck Outta here.
And the bear just gets up and leaves.

2352
01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:05,910
But I mean,
he's like a school bus.

2353
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:07,870
Yeah,
it's so minivan.

2354
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,140
I always describe it like a minivan.
Did you find one?

2355
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:11,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

2356
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:12,361
This is it.
This is it.

2357
01:47:12,361 --> 01:47:13,560
Look at this.
Look at this.

2358
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:16,300
Wow.
Look at the size of this.

2359
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:20,410
It just sat next to his chair.
Just pulls up to his chair.

2360
01:47:20,820 --> 01:47:23,020
Ah,
beautiful animal.

2361
01:47:23,021 --> 01:47:24,160
They'll look at that thing.
Oh my,

2362
01:47:24,161 --> 01:47:26,640
there's the gorgeous with Dex to do.
If that's you,

2363
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:28,300
um,
you can't do shit.

2364
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:32,350
Can't do shit because like you,
you don't want to provoke it.

2365
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:33,620
No,
no,

2366
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:35,290
you definitely don't want to back up 
that thing.

2367
01:47:35,291 --> 01:47:37,060
He's just chasing salmon right now.
Yeah.

2368
01:47:37,061 --> 01:47:38,830
You don't want to yell at it.
Yeah.

2369
01:47:38,831 --> 01:47:41,140
As long as you don't hit it doesn't 
think you're a threat.

2370
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:43,150
They're really dumb.
Right.

2371
01:47:43,151 --> 01:47:44,490
In their mind,
ma'am.

2372
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,970
Not that I'm like,
no,

2373
01:47:46,030 --> 01:47:47,380
I mean like,
like dumb.

2374
01:47:47,381 --> 01:47:49,060
Like if they were a person,
they'd be retarded.

2375
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,193
Right,
right.

2376
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:53,383
Okay.

2377
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:55,790
The syllable,
there's simple.

2378
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:56,870
They're predators,
you know,

2379
01:47:56,871 --> 01:47:58,550
they get in their head like what they 
want to do.

2380
01:47:58,551 --> 01:48:00,320
Oh my God,
he's just sitting down.

2381
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:03,440
This is awesome.
Just decided chill.

2382
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:05,280
What a clear shot.
Well,

2383
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:07,190
they'll look at is huge.
Look at his claws.

2384
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:08,960
Yeah.
One Swipe.

2385
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:11,180
I mean,
your face is off.

2386
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:14,180
The guys filming this is 10 feet away 
from him.

2387
01:48:15,410 --> 01:48:17,810
He's right there and the eventually 
talks to him.

2388
01:48:17,811 --> 01:48:18,171
He's like,
Hey,

2389
01:48:18,171 --> 01:48:20,150
get outta here.
Like the bear looks at him and like,

2390
01:48:20,151 --> 01:48:21,500
we really,
you,

2391
01:48:22,090 --> 01:48:27,090
hey,
look how close it is.

2392
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:30,830
The bear looks like a little annoyed for
a second.

2393
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:33,080
Do the thing.
Just wandered towards him.

2394
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:34,573
Seriously.

2395
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:36,210
God,
they're everywhere.

2396
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:38,850
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

2397
01:48:38,851 --> 01:48:41,160
Now I don't even feel bad for that guy 
back that up,

2398
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:42,323
like watch or they go to the river.
This guy's sitting with a lawn chair by 

2399
01:48:46,021 --> 01:48:47,760
the river while one,
two,

2400
01:48:47,761 --> 01:48:48,900
let's see,
three,

2401
01:48:48,901 --> 01:48:50,040
four,
five,

2402
01:48:50,041 --> 01:48:53,580
six and that one says,
oh my God.

2403
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:55,910
Oh my God,
there's a dozen.

2404
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:58,940
Bears is a dozen.
Massive grizzly bears seen it.

2405
01:48:59,370 --> 01:49:01,170
Oh my God,
I'm so scared.

2406
01:49:02,130 --> 01:49:03,470
Oh my God.
There's more.

2407
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:05,100
Look at those other two.
One,

2408
01:49:05,101 --> 01:49:05,671
two,
three,

2409
01:49:05,671 --> 01:49:06,211
four,
five,

2410
01:49:06,211 --> 01:49:06,841
six,
seven,

2411
01:49:06,841 --> 01:49:07,441
eight,
nine,

2412
01:49:07,441 --> 01:49:08,274
10,
11.

2413
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:09,390
God,
how funny.

2414
01:49:09,391 --> 01:49:12,030
If you hold back in the guy with the 
camera as a bear.

2415
01:49:15,690 --> 01:49:16,310
Oh,

2416
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:18,560
Jesus Christ.
That's amazing.

2417
01:49:18,710 --> 01:49:20,990
Oh my God.
They're the coolest animal.

2418
01:49:21,050 --> 01:49:22,480
That's my favorite animal.
Dan.

2419
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:23,540
Cool.
Until they're eating you.

2420
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:25,100
Yeah,
and not so cool.

2421
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:26,300
No.
Yeah,

2422
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:28,280
they're,
it's so at.

2423
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:31,880
They are so cool to look at it when they
get up and they're just,

2424
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:33,440
ah,
have you ever eaten bear?

2425
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:34,820
No.
It's good.

2426
01:49:35,270 --> 01:49:36,103
Brown bear is not so good.
Like those are not so good because they 

2427
01:49:38,710 --> 01:49:40,430
mostly,
they're mostly predators,

2428
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:41,700
but black bear.
Yeah,

2429
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:45,090
they eat a lot of berries and like 
little strat.

2430
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:47,920
It's traditional like hunters have been 
bear forever.

2431
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,530
I thought like when people want to hunt 
bear I,

2432
01:49:50,531 --> 01:49:52,270
before I became a hunter,
I was like,

2433
01:49:52,630 --> 01:49:54,250
why would you want to shoot a bear?
That's kind of stupid.

2434
01:49:54,251 --> 01:49:55,690
That's like a,
it's gross.

2435
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:56,121
He's like,
why?

2436
01:49:56,121 --> 01:49:56,954
I thought of it like trophy hunting.
Like someone who goes out and kills a 

2437
01:50:00,071 --> 01:50:01,090
rhino or something like that.

2438
01:50:01,090 --> 01:50:01,511
Like,
oh,

2439
01:50:01,511 --> 01:50:04,000
why are you doing that man?
You just doing that to stuff,

2440
01:50:04,001 --> 01:50:05,170
that thing or something.
Yeah.

2441
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:06,213
But no,
they eat them and who turns trying to 

2442
01:50:08,441 --> 01:50:12,290
trying to bear hunting.
My friend Cameron Hanes is a bow hunter.

2443
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:13,390
Oh yeah.
He's like,

2444
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:14,920
he's like,
they taste good,

2445
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:16,270
don't listen to anybody.
And he was like,

2446
01:50:16,271 --> 01:50:18,340
everybody has this idea in their head 
that you don't eat them.

2447
01:50:18,341 --> 01:50:19,240
And he goes,
that's not true.

2448
01:50:19,241 --> 01:50:21,610
Up in Canada in particular,
like where we hunt.

2449
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:22,473
It's traditional.
Every year people go out hunting bear 

2450
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:27,520
and a Alberta.
They're delicious man.

2451
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:29,350
The way I described it as like a deer in
a pig,

2452
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:30,970
it's like a combination of deer and 
pigs.

2453
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,680
Deer and pig.
Yeah.

2454
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:35,260
It's an interesting,
it's almost kind of like kind of a beefy

2455
01:50:35,261 --> 01:50:36,094
flavor.
They make roasts out of foam and all 

2456
01:50:37,211 --> 01:50:38,044
these different things and they have to 
keep the population down because they 

2457
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:41,884
don't have any predators,
so there's massive numbers of them and 

2458
01:50:44,411 --> 01:50:48,970
they slaughtered the moose and the deer 
and so well up there who pries moose and

2459
01:50:48,971 --> 01:50:51,370
deer,
which is like really important for their

2460
01:50:51,371 --> 01:50:51,850
food.

2461
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:53,350
That's most of what they eat,
right?

2462
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:55,000
Yeah.
I've heard of people having Mousse.

2463
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:57,220
I never heard of people having bear.
Yeah.

2464
01:50:57,460 --> 01:51:00,220
It was a lot of bear hunting.
A lot of a spring and fall.

2465
01:51:00,221 --> 01:51:03,580
Bear hunting apparently falls the best 
because when they eat berries,

2466
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:05,110
when they,
especially blueberries,

2467
01:51:05,111 --> 01:51:10,111
they actually get a blueberry tint to 
their fat and their meat smells sweet.

2468
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:12,010
Oh,
interesting.

2469
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:14,590
Well that's really weird.
But your body,

2470
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:19,000
like those grizzlies are bad to eat 
because their eating raw fish and rotten

2471
01:51:19,001 --> 01:51:21,160
fish all the time.
The carcasses.

2472
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:23,770
Like if you need a bear that's been 
eating like a dead Moose,

2473
01:51:23,771 --> 01:51:27,100
like of a moose gets killed and just eat
the carcass there.

2474
01:51:27,101 --> 01:51:28,860
That's tastes terrible.
So like you,

2475
01:51:28,861 --> 01:51:31,540
you are what you eat and you can apply 
that to yourself.

2476
01:51:31,541 --> 01:51:32,374
Like your body literally is built up as 
we were talking about earlier of the 

2477
01:51:35,801 --> 01:51:38,560
nutrients that you put in at the food 
that you put it in your dietary choices.

2478
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:39,723
That's the same thing with bears.
So these black bears that are living up 

2479
01:51:42,281 --> 01:51:44,290
there,
they're mostly eating.

2480
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:45,730
Look,
when they get a chance,

2481
01:51:45,731 --> 01:51:48,950
they eat a lot of fawns like deer fawns 
and um,

2482
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:50,500
calves,
Moose calves.

2483
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:53,680
And occasionally that can eat an actual 
dear like of a deer,

2484
01:51:53,681 --> 01:51:55,560
breaks its leg or fucks up.
Most of the time,

2485
01:51:55,580 --> 01:51:57,130
deer can get away when they're full 
grown,

2486
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:59,500
but the,
the ones that need the berries,

2487
01:51:59,501 --> 01:52:02,870
they're delicious.
And this is like a Jesus Christ set.

2488
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:05,350
The same guy that's a picture from the 
place I looked it up.

2489
01:52:05,351 --> 01:52:07,930
It's called the Mcneil's state thinks 
she wearing and Alaska.

2490
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:10,270
Oh my God.
One is apparently ever died there,

2491
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:12,730
but all these bears come in for three 
months.

2492
01:52:12,731 --> 01:52:16,210
They gather and just gorge on Salmon,
so they're not even looking for that.

2493
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:16,811
Oh,
okay.

2494
01:52:16,811 --> 01:52:17,644
That's amazing.
That's one of the cool things about 

2495
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:20,500
those bears.
Yeah.

2496
01:52:20,501 --> 01:52:22,630
They're in those situations like they 
just have it in their head like,

2497
01:52:22,631 --> 01:52:23,800
okay,
we're just eating fish now.

2498
01:52:23,830 --> 01:52:26,050
I'm eating fish.
I don't get how many of them there are.

2499
01:52:26,051 --> 01:52:28,870
That's amazing.
We're looking at a photograph and Jamie,

2500
01:52:28,871 --> 01:52:32,230
where'd you find this photo?
It just googled mcneil animals are,

2501
01:52:32,410 --> 01:52:33,670
so there's,
in this image,

2502
01:52:33,671 --> 01:52:34,451
there's three,
four,

2503
01:52:34,451 --> 01:52:35,261
five,
six,

2504
01:52:35,261 --> 01:52:40,261
78910111213 1415 61718192212 I shoot 
2124 25 bears just in this one photo.

2505
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:46,460
She's,
and they're giant.

2506
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:51,020
That is giant grizzlies.
Kodiak is the weirdest place man,

2507
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:52,063
because Kodiak is an island,
but it has the biggest brown bears in 

2508
01:52:55,371 --> 01:52:56,750
the world.
Does the brown bears,

2509
01:52:58,010 --> 01:53:01,630
brown bears and grizzlies are the same 
thing was Kodiak?

2510
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:03,380
No,
he bought it in Alaska.

2511
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:06,290
He bought in a place called the grizzly 
maze,

2512
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:07,740
which is a,
a,

2513
01:53:07,741 --> 01:53:09,140
a place where,
what does he eat?

2514
01:53:09,141 --> 01:53:11,000
And they're dumb place to go.
Is that a fish?

2515
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:13,400
Yeah.
Fish like crab,

2516
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:17,540
but um,
google the giant bears of Kodiak because

2517
01:53:17,541 --> 01:53:18,374
they're the most enormous grizzly bears 
or brown bears rather in the world when 

2518
01:53:22,671 --> 01:53:23,504
they're on the coast,
they call them brown bears when they're 

2519
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:27,170
interior that calm grizzly bears.
That's the difference.

2520
01:53:27,171 --> 01:53:30,020
It's the same exact animal.
That's a dead one.

2521
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:32,170
Look at the size of that thing that's 
mad.

2522
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:37,240
Oh,
what the fuck band does that affect?

2523
01:53:37,311 --> 01:53:38,810
I think that's a trained bear actually.

2524
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:40,511
Yeah,
the guy,

2525
01:53:40,511 --> 01:53:42,770
I see the guy and I think that's a 
trained bear.

2526
01:53:42,771 --> 01:53:45,410
I think that's like a movie bear.
Look at that one down there.

2527
01:53:45,530 --> 01:53:46,363
Look at that one right where I pulled 
out with the guy standing there with a 

2528
01:53:47,931 --> 01:53:50,880
rifle above and to the right above and 
to the right.

2529
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:52,110
Right.
That's okay.

2530
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:54,230
Yeah.
Look at that.

2531
01:53:54,230 --> 01:53:55,063
What the fuck?
We're going to have feet with the size 

2532
01:53:57,771 --> 01:54:01,220
of the biggest feeder and you know 
what's crazy?

2533
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:02,233
There was a bear that was way bigger 
than that called the short face bear 

2534
01:54:05,151 --> 01:54:05,984
that we were,
we brought up the other day that was 

2535
01:54:07,611 --> 01:54:12,611
apparently the most fearsome Predator in
North America up until like 11,000

2536
01:54:13,041 --> 01:54:14,390
years ago.
She,

2537
01:54:14,450 --> 01:54:19,450
the thing running that is so wild.
It's so crazy that this being exists.

2538
01:54:21,650 --> 01:54:22,730
I know,
you know,

2539
01:54:22,731 --> 01:54:25,340
because if you,
if you didn't have bears,

2540
01:54:25,341 --> 01:54:28,070
if they weren't real and then it was in 
a movie,

2541
01:54:28,071 --> 01:54:30,380
you'd be like a,
if those things were running around,

2542
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:33,710
but they really are running around and 
we just get so used to them.

2543
01:54:34,190 --> 01:54:36,050
When you hike in the back country like 
that,

2544
01:54:36,051 --> 01:54:38,360
you have to put all your food in these 
containers,

2545
01:54:38,630 --> 01:54:40,730
these black container and hang on first.
Yeah.

2546
01:54:40,731 --> 01:54:44,780
The first time I did it I was like,
I had all this food.

2547
01:54:44,781 --> 01:54:45,860
And it's like,
oh,

2548
01:54:45,861 --> 01:54:47,660
so you just put it in a bag and you hang
it up there.

2549
01:54:47,661 --> 01:54:48,261
They're like,
no,

2550
01:54:48,261 --> 01:54:52,130
you put it in these cylinders sealed off
and then you put them,

2551
01:54:52,131 --> 01:54:53,600
you can eat.
You don't even have to hang them.

2552
01:54:53,601 --> 01:54:55,760
You can just get them out of the way 
cause they're just completely sealed.

2553
01:54:55,910 --> 01:54:56,743
Right.
But the amount of food you can fit in 

2554
01:54:58,041 --> 01:55:01,160
that is like you'd have to bring all 
packs of stuff.

2555
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:02,433
It's like has to be so small,
you have to live so small because they 

2556
01:55:05,631 --> 01:55:06,464
just come and sometimes you're in your 
tent and you just hear Oh oh well they 

2557
01:55:13,071 --> 01:55:13,904
have,
I'm dehydrated food and freeze dried 

2558
01:55:16,101 --> 01:55:16,934
food and freeze dried food is you just 
add hot water to but dehydrated gets 

2559
01:55:21,021 --> 01:55:21,854
really,
really small so you can pack a lot of 

2560
01:55:24,501 --> 01:55:25,910
food into a very small area.

2561
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:27,680
You just have to figure out how to add 
water to it.

2562
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:29,360
It's got to be me like I haven't done 
it.

2563
01:55:29,361 --> 01:55:34,040
And probably 12 years,
the amount of improvement that must have

2564
01:55:34,041 --> 01:55:36,650
gone on in those 12 years.
It's gotta be my on the food.

2565
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:38,660
Yeah.
Just going into the camping section must

2566
01:55:38,661 --> 01:55:39,494
be like a whole futuristic thing now.
I think the big improvement is 

2567
01:55:42,261 --> 01:55:43,920
dehydration,
um,

2568
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:47,220
versus freeze drying.
I think that as far as like space,

2569
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:48,293
how much space that you save.
So when you see a bear and you're there 

2570
01:55:50,941 --> 01:55:52,590
with your little bow and Arrow,
no,

2571
01:55:52,591 --> 01:55:55,530
you're fucked.
Are you a not good?

2572
01:55:55,650 --> 01:55:57,000
Are you scared?
Oh yeah,

2573
01:55:57,001 --> 01:55:57,870
for sure,
man.

2574
01:55:58,470 --> 01:55:59,490
Yeah.
If you see bears,

2575
01:55:59,491 --> 01:56:02,610
you should be fucking nervous as shit.
I mean,

2576
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:04,680
most likely they're not going to come 
get you,

2577
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:08,700
but they might if you miss,
like if you hit it and it's knee,

2578
01:56:08,850 --> 01:56:10,260
will he be pissed and come get you?

2579
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:12,750
Perhaps most likely they were going 
away.

2580
01:56:12,990 --> 01:56:14,040
Right?
Most likely.

2581
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:15,113
Um,
I know a guy who knows a guy who's 

2582
01:56:18,511 --> 01:56:23,100
friend was attack as were many,
several steps removed.

2583
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,600
It's,
I know it's a good story.

2584
01:56:24,601 --> 01:56:27,780
The first hunting trip ever,
I think they were hunting for deer.

2585
01:56:27,781 --> 01:56:28,614
He's in his tent and he gets mauled in 
his tent by a 500 pound predatory black 

2586
01:56:33,181 --> 01:56:35,360
bear.
500 pounds,

2587
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:36,840
500 gum that black.
Oh,

2588
01:56:36,841 --> 01:56:38,460
they get bigger than that.
Do they really?

2589
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:39,480
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2590
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:42,310
I thought black bear where like the 
small bear into the know,

2591
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:45,090
sometimes small,
but that's when they're juvenile.

2592
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:48,910
Like they have a hard scrabble life man.
Most of them get eaten as cubs rather.

2593
01:56:48,930 --> 01:56:50,970
Bears.
Bears are cannibals.

2594
01:56:51,050 --> 01:56:51,660
Oh really?
Yeah.

2595
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:53,220
Especially Blackburn's.
Oh yeah.

2596
01:56:53,221 --> 01:56:54,450
Well,
brown bears too,

2597
01:56:54,451 --> 01:56:56,400
but,
but black bears get enormous.

2598
01:56:56,430 --> 01:57:00,660
A friend of mine just killed one that 
was eight and a half feet tall.

2599
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:01,980
Cheese.
Yeah.

2600
01:57:01,981 --> 01:57:02,814
Look at this picture.
I'm gonna show you a picture and you're 

2601
01:57:04,111 --> 01:57:05,010
going to go,
what?

2602
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:08,100
Lydia?
Size that.

2603
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:10,230
That's black bear.
Well,

2604
01:57:10,231 --> 01:57:12,790
it's big.
Eight and a half feet wide.

2605
01:57:12,910 --> 01:57:14,100
Eight foot,
three inches.

2606
01:57:14,290 --> 01:57:16,230
So you,
you're deep in the woods.

2607
01:57:16,710 --> 01:57:18,150
You kill this thing.
Hey,

2608
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:19,200
get it out of there.
Well,

2609
01:57:19,201 --> 01:57:21,960
you got to cut it up.
Cut it up and pack it out.

2610
01:57:21,990 --> 01:57:22,823
Yeah,
you have to.

2611
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:27,240
There's no other way,
unless you have a large suv or something

2612
01:57:27,241 --> 01:57:29,580
that you can drag it into,
but you're walking in.

2613
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:30,990
Yeah.
If you're walking in,

2614
01:57:30,991 --> 01:57:34,350
you're going to have to pack that out.
She's didn't take his head.

2615
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:36,420
They take you.
Take everything.

2616
01:57:36,450 --> 01:57:37,320
Take it all.
Yeah.

2617
01:57:37,321 --> 01:57:40,470
If you're going to kill an animal,
I think you should take everything.

2618
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:43,590
Right.
You should take all the meat for sure.

2619
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:47,310
And like these skulls that you see,
like that deer,

2620
01:57:47,790 --> 01:57:49,080
the deer,
moose,

2621
01:57:49,081 --> 01:57:51,390
and the deer over there and the elk 
that's out there,

2622
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:54,450
those are all a mean,
right?

2623
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:55,610
Those are,
that's,

2624
01:57:55,980 --> 01:58:00,050
it becomes like,
I don't want to say a decoration because

2625
01:58:00,051 --> 01:58:03,660
it's way more powerful than that.
Like if I had to choose like anything to

2626
01:58:03,661 --> 01:58:05,460
keep in this room,
it would be the skulls.

2627
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:06,373
Like regular,
like you could take a couple of things 

2628
01:58:07,351 --> 01:58:08,550
in this room.
Everything else has to go.

2629
01:58:08,551 --> 01:58:09,384
I'm like,
I'm not letting these skulls go to 

2630
01:58:10,741 --> 01:58:11,441
waste.
It's just,

2631
01:58:11,441 --> 01:58:13,620
they mean it means too much as far as 
like,

2632
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:15,740
right.
There's a spiritual level too.

2633
01:58:16,910 --> 01:58:20,540
It's a connection.
It's like these animals there.

2634
01:58:20,541 --> 01:58:22,890
Uh,
there's a bunch of things that happens.

2635
01:58:23,070 --> 01:58:24,090
You eat them,
you,

2636
01:58:24,091 --> 01:58:25,320
you shoot them,
you eat them,

2637
01:58:25,530 --> 01:58:27,900
they become food.
You have friends over I give,

2638
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:29,250
I'm going to give you some elk when you 
leave.

2639
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:30,160
Give you some ground.
Yeah.

2640
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:31,103
Yeah.
I've got a whole freezer back there for 

2641
01:58:31,810 --> 01:58:32,643
really?
Yeah.

2642
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:34,410
It's delicious.
You'll love it.

2643
01:58:34,830 --> 01:58:35,663
Can you dunk your bread in it?
He can make elk burgers with your sour 

2644
01:58:39,991 --> 01:58:41,950
dough bread.
But it's,

2645
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:45,730
I feel like there's a responsibility.
You're the caretaker of their skulls,

2646
01:58:45,810 --> 01:58:46,643
if that makes any sense.
Does it right when Vegan shoot 

2647
01:58:49,001 --> 01:58:49,960
themselves?
Like,

2648
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:51,870
I can't take this anymore.
The other jammer,

2649
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:54,100
biggest black bear.
Oh,

2650
01:58:54,110 --> 01:58:55,870
they found out,
wait up to 900 pounds.

2651
01:58:55,871 --> 01:58:56,501
They think,
oh,

2652
01:58:56,501 --> 01:59:00,160
mom is constantly does size of that 
fucking thing.

2653
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:02,070
Bear expert.
Jeff Trask,

2654
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:02,913
US saw Ted and Ted's lifelong Wisconsin 
home an estimated him at over 900 

2655
01:59:07,781 --> 01:59:09,730
pounds.
Ted then went into hibernation,

2656
01:59:09,731 --> 01:59:11,650
lost weight over winter,
20% loss,

2657
01:59:12,330 --> 01:59:14,110
18 120 pounds.
Bup,

2658
01:59:14,111 --> 01:59:14,944
Bup,
bup about Ted arrived here at the North 

2659
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:18,670
American bear center in 2007.
It's still at a huge belly.

2660
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:22,810
Uh,
he weighed 860 pounds,

2661
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:24,820
so they captured him.
Is that what happened?

2662
01:59:26,050 --> 01:59:26,883
She wasn't there.
A real popular band that just got shot 

2663
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,270
in yellowstone.
Yeah.

2664
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:34,180
He got shot outside of yellowstone by a 
poacher.

2665
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:35,590
It was a poacher.
Yeah.

2666
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:37,930
It was a bear that was dying already 
anyway,

2667
01:59:37,950 --> 01:59:41,770
had lost 50% of his body weight.
He was all scarred up.

2668
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:43,000
He was like,
people knew him.

2669
01:59:43,001 --> 01:59:45,010
Like legendary bear.
Yeah.

2670
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:46,143
He apparently had scars all over him.
That's how he could tell what he looked 

2671
01:59:48,431 --> 01:59:50,290
like from fighting with other bears,
his face.

2672
01:59:50,291 --> 01:59:52,780
It's just ripped apart.
A lot of marriage,

2673
01:59:53,540 --> 01:59:58,540
love and marriage.
Marriage get you shine bucks.

2674
02:00:02,640 --> 02:00:03,473
You and Polanski can hit the skids.
That's another thing I'm doing this 

2675
02:00:07,420 --> 02:00:08,500
summer.
I'm going to yellowstone.

2676
02:00:08,530 --> 02:00:10,210
I haven't been yellowstone since I was a
kid.

2677
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:11,380
Oh Man.
Go on.

2678
02:00:11,381 --> 02:00:12,340
I can't wait.
I want,

2679
02:00:12,341 --> 02:00:14,800
I hope we see some wolves.
That'd be the coolest shit ever.

2680
02:00:15,070 --> 02:00:16,990
It's the coolest.
Yeah.

2681
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:22,500
I saw wolves,
Moose and Bison.

2682
02:00:22,810 --> 02:00:24,850
When did you go?
Uh,

2683
02:00:24,851 --> 02:00:28,450
when my wife and I were dating first 
started dating,

2684
02:00:28,451 --> 02:00:32,470
which would be 18 years ago now.
Now on a motorcycle.

2685
02:00:32,471 --> 02:00:34,050
Wow.
You went to yellowstone.

2686
02:00:34,051 --> 02:00:35,320
Him,
you fucking rebel.

2687
02:00:35,321 --> 02:00:39,730
Cross country for five weeks.
Wild ass professional comedian.

2688
02:00:39,731 --> 02:00:42,970
You must have killed her.
I found a real man,

2689
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:46,450
wild man with a motorcycle.
Once a fucking go chase down a moose.

2690
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:48,580
I don't want to stay here.
Let's go to the days inn.

2691
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:49,810
That was me,
not her.

2692
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:55,180
And she want a camp on top of a rock,
but we can't.

2693
02:00:55,180 --> 02:00:56,710
Uh,
we did a lot of days.

2694
02:00:56,711 --> 02:00:57,730
It was across the country.
We were,

2695
02:00:57,731 --> 02:00:59,470
when we got to the tetons in 
yellowstone,

2696
02:00:59,471 --> 02:01:00,304
we camped and man in the tent and 
looking across this field at just bison 

2697
02:01:07,090 --> 02:01:08,980
like early morning,
like 5:00

2698
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:12,610
AM just watching bison do their thing 
and you're just,

2699
02:01:13,090 --> 02:01:15,970
you just woke up there too.
It's amazing.

2700
02:01:16,090 --> 02:01:16,923
You know what's so cool about that?
That that park is essentially the same 

2701
02:01:19,871 --> 02:01:22,030
way it was a hundred years ago.
Amazing gear.

2702
02:01:22,031 --> 02:01:24,010
You're sitting there and these animals 
are living.

2703
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:26,320
Look at that.
It's near old faithful.

2704
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:27,820
Oh,
it's the greatest.

2705
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:31,030
What?
Amazing animals bisons are incredible.

2706
02:01:31,031 --> 02:01:32,720
I mean just,
they don't even look real.

2707
02:01:32,721 --> 02:01:33,554
What?
They're crazy beards and big stupid 

2708
02:01:35,141 --> 02:01:37,930
heads and their high heels.
Yeah.

2709
02:01:37,940 --> 02:01:38,773
Right?
Like if you're going to have an animal 

2710
02:01:39,771 --> 02:01:40,070
that

2711
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:41,210
big,
why did it have feet?

2712
02:01:41,211 --> 02:01:46,130
So little little dainty girl,
fake Chinese foot binding and shit for a

2713
02:01:46,131 --> 02:01:50,760
giant biceps.
He's got a felonious munk t what is it?

2714
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:53,720
Why is the color of that ground,
Jamie?

2715
02:01:53,721 --> 02:01:55,760
Why is it so orange like that?
Yeah,

2716
02:01:55,761 --> 02:01:57,200
but go back to that picture,
right?

2717
02:01:57,680 --> 02:01:58,760
Is that what it is?
Probably.

2718
02:01:58,790 --> 02:02:00,170
God.
It's so beautiful.

2719
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,030
That's so crazy.
Looking at,

2720
02:02:02,060 --> 02:02:03,800
Oh,
it's the craziest,

2721
02:02:04,370 --> 02:02:08,660
crazy that that is a volcano that just 
has like a leaky spot.

2722
02:02:09,140 --> 02:02:11,810
It's so amazing.
I went when I was like,

2723
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:14,180
and there are lesser geysers as you go 
around,

2724
02:02:14,181 --> 02:02:15,130
you know,
not just faith,

2725
02:02:16,490 --> 02:02:17,323
but it's a giant volcano.
They have something like 2000 

2726
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:22,520
earthquakes a year there.
Maybe even more.

2727
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:24,080
Oh,
we have this little baby ones.

2728
02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:25,123
Is that a wolf?
That's a wolf that that population came 

2729
02:02:27,621 --> 02:02:28,950
roaring back to.
Well,

2730
02:02:28,970 --> 02:02:30,110
they really successful.
Accessible.

2731
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:32,180
They brought them back.
It wasn't,

2732
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:34,010
um,
it wasn't that they came back.

2733
02:02:34,011 --> 02:02:37,880
They brought wolves from North America.
From Canada rather.

2734
02:02:38,660 --> 02:02:39,650
They're different.
Oh,

2735
02:02:39,651 --> 02:02:41,120
they are here.
They're larger.

2736
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:44,660
They're larger wolves.
Larger Grey Wolf's from North America,

2737
02:02:44,690 --> 02:02:46,880
from North America.
Keeps saying that from Canada.

2738
02:02:46,970 --> 02:02:49,150
We get that little cute fucker.
We'll see guy.

2739
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:53,060
Is that a white talking about me fellas?
What is he a weasel,

2740
02:02:54,340 --> 02:02:56,050
but I'm a big guy too.
Cute.

2741
02:02:56,110 --> 02:02:56,720
Hey,
look at me.

2742
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:59,510
Hey fucker.
Fucker.

2743
02:02:59,511 --> 02:03:03,860
You got a sandwich for me?
That's a white weasel guy.

2744
02:03:03,861 --> 02:03:05,120
He's so adorable.
Yeah.

2745
02:03:05,121 --> 02:03:06,420
Take a look at me.
What a little,

2746
02:03:06,620 --> 02:03:08,960
isn't it funny that's a little murderer,
right?

2747
02:03:08,961 --> 02:03:11,170
Exactly.
Scavenger if our rabbits,

2748
02:03:11,171 --> 02:03:11,900
he's dad.
He's like,

2749
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:14,120
fuck,
fuck,

2750
02:03:14,121 --> 02:03:15,320
fuck,
fuck.

2751
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:22,100
What the hell are you doing?
Ferris are illegal in California,

2752
02:03:22,101 --> 02:03:25,850
but pitbulls are fuck the bears.
Come hang out with me.

2753
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:28,020
I said,
what can it be in this lot?

2754
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:34,100
I don't even know were alive.
They're practically retarded.

2755
02:03:36,410 --> 02:03:38,120
There was a fully a cute little bear 
cub.

2756
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:39,253
There was a photo that I had on my 
instagram page of a bear with a 

2757
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:47,330
groundhog in its mouth,
like completely in its mouth.

2758
02:03:47,331 --> 02:03:49,490
We just like the feet are poking out at 
the,

2759
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:51,080
they were like,
oh,

2760
02:03:51,081 --> 02:03:55,430
these fucking things are so big.
They're just eating machines,

2761
02:03:55,431 --> 02:03:56,960
man.
This is all day.

2762
02:03:57,590 --> 02:03:59,720
You know,
it's my new animal who,

2763
02:03:59,721 --> 02:04:00,554
uh,
I saw a documentary bears in my main 

2764
02:04:02,751 --> 02:04:03,620
animal,
but uh,

2765
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:07,910
this year's animal is the beaver 
beavers.

2766
02:04:07,911 --> 02:04:09,290
Cool.
Holy Cow.

2767
02:04:09,410 --> 02:04:12,590
Those things are amazing.
Weird fucking animal too,

2768
02:04:12,591 --> 02:04:13,490
Huh?
Weird.

2769
02:04:13,491 --> 02:04:15,860
A weird ass tail.
Just going to work.

2770
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:19,310
Nasty ass buck teeth changing river 
flows.

2771
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:20,353
They put these stuck some beavers in 
Nevada and they brought back a whole 

2772
02:04:24,051 --> 02:04:26,660
region.
They manage the water.

2773
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:28,160
They do some weird shit,
man.

2774
02:04:28,161 --> 02:04:28,994
They all have a weird place.
That's one of the coolest things about 

2775
02:04:30,681 --> 02:04:31,514
nature's.
He's weird places that every hat every 

2776
02:04:33,381 --> 02:04:36,920
animal has in the system.
These things are amazing.

2777
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,100
They just go in and

2778
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,400
just go to town.
They changed the whole bottom of the,

2779
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:42,473
of the lake and the river.
They just take all of the wood and they 

2780
02:04:45,091 --> 02:04:47,550
stick with their family.
They're very family oriented animals.

2781
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:48,473
What a strange animal that like 
regularly choose down trees and build 

2782
02:04:51,301 --> 02:04:54,300
structures.
Just constant.

2783
02:04:54,450 --> 02:04:55,890
What other animals like that?
None.

2784
02:04:55,891 --> 02:04:56,730
None.
Sorry.

2785
02:04:56,900 --> 02:05:00,350
Nine just goes to work with his face but
hasn't know.

2786
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:02,940
How's he known to chop down that tree?
That's what he does.

2787
02:05:02,941 --> 02:05:07,941
I'm a beaver fever.
I chew what asshole.

2788
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:11,820
Saw that and thought that's be a good 
nickname for a pussy.

2789
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:13,920
Right?
Exactly.

2790
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:16,310
And then we see a beaver.
Beaver.

2791
02:05:16,430 --> 02:05:19,200
What is your,
what is all going on within that?

2792
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:23,610
There was was one,
so I can't look shit up with your kids.

2793
02:05:24,450 --> 02:05:25,283
Oh,
that's not the kind of beaver were 

2794
02:05:25,921 --> 02:05:29,580
looking for hunting.
If I had to pick one animal that I could

2795
02:05:29,581 --> 02:05:30,900
see in the,
in the woods,

2796
02:05:30,901 --> 02:05:32,850
like accidentally say like wandering 
around.

2797
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:37,860
I think it'd be a Wolverine Wolverine 
just to see them like apparently they're

2798
02:05:37,861 --> 02:05:38,694
really rare to see.
Apparently you could like be like a 

2799
02:05:41,461 --> 02:05:45,570
woodsmen woods and never see her woods 
woman a woodsman for many years.

2800
02:05:45,630 --> 02:05:48,450
I'd like to be an admin.
What'd Ya get bored after awhile.

2801
02:05:48,630 --> 02:05:51,450
Yeah.
He smelled to share.

2802
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:54,840
You could shower or bathe in the river.
He had don't go down the stream.

2803
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:57,810
You're not doing wolverine.
That's a wolverine.

2804
02:05:58,230 --> 02:05:59,850
You don't want to see that for it.
Yeah,

2805
02:05:59,851 --> 02:06:00,684
he did.
They don't really,

2806
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:04,230
they're like,
what in the fuck?

2807
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:05,460
Look at his face.
No,

2808
02:06:05,461 --> 02:06:07,110
they're in America.
What for?

2809
02:06:07,111 --> 02:06:07,980
Yeah,
for sure.

2810
02:06:07,981 --> 02:06:09,420
Like in Yosemite.
Oh,

2811
02:06:09,421 --> 02:06:11,730
Karen tead.
They have some wolverines out there.

2812
02:06:11,780 --> 02:06:12,840
Oh,
look at that.

2813
02:06:12,870 --> 02:06:14,910
Look at those teeth.
Ferocious little animal.

2814
02:06:14,911 --> 02:06:17,790
No big as that.
They get that big,

2815
02:06:17,791 --> 02:06:19,320
I think they're like 50 pounds or so.
Oh,

2816
02:06:19,321 --> 02:06:20,490
the biggest asshole kid.

2817
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:22,710
Jesus fucking Christ kid.
Oh,

2818
02:06:22,711 --> 02:06:24,030
it's on a way.
She's on a leash.

2819
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:26,470
Wolverine on a leash.
I don't want to see that.

2820
02:06:26,810 --> 02:06:28,980
It looks gross.
Oh two based.

2821
02:06:29,070 --> 02:06:32,490
It's got like a sloth body.
Come on,

2822
02:06:32,491 --> 02:06:34,110
look at this one.
Messed up his face.

2823
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:36,240
Got a couple of them that he's holding 
onto the road.

2824
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,650
There was a door.
I don't like him.

2825
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:43,560
You don't know during the weasel family 
apparently.

2826
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:46,000
I like a nice beaver.
A Nice laid back guy.

2827
02:06:46,001 --> 02:06:47,790
He's got a tail.
He little teeth.

2828
02:06:47,791 --> 02:06:49,400
He goes to work.
He can't really talk to you.

2829
02:06:49,401 --> 02:06:51,430
He's working on this.
His projects.

2830
02:06:51,460 --> 02:06:53,550
You prefer the animals are 
nonthreatening?

2831
02:06:53,930 --> 02:06:55,050
No,
but I love the bear.

2832
02:06:55,051 --> 02:06:58,680
The bear is my main animal.
I think wolves too.

2833
02:06:58,740 --> 02:07:02,460
I think wolf would be like,
if I could see a pack of wolf take out,

2834
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:04,620
like take out a deer.
I think that'd be cool.

2835
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:06,300
Shit.
This is why we got to go to Africa.

2836
02:07:06,301 --> 02:07:07,860
We're going to see so much shit.
Whoa.

2837
02:07:08,490 --> 02:07:12,090
We're going to see a lot of stuff.
You think a lot of stuff.

2838
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:14,100
We can say everything.
Eating everything.

2839
02:07:14,780 --> 02:07:16,890
It's going to be lions,
eating bears,

2840
02:07:16,891 --> 02:07:18,650
eating zebras,
no bears.

2841
02:07:18,680 --> 02:07:19,513
There's going to be lions eating zebras.
It's going to be giraffes being ripped 

2842
02:07:21,871 --> 02:07:22,704
apart.
This has got to put everything in 

2843
02:07:24,361 --> 02:07:25,194
perspective.
How long is the flight going through 

2844
02:07:28,051 --> 02:07:31,980
Amsterdam from New York?
I'm going to go to New York first,

2845
02:07:31,981 --> 02:07:33,930
then I'm going to go from there to 
Amsterdam,

2846
02:07:33,931 --> 02:07:35,070
to Tanzania,
and that's

2847
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:36,903
I think a 16 hour ordeal.
So it's live to stop though from La to 

2848
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:45,950
what does this Jamie led in New York is 
fine.

2849
02:07:46,540 --> 02:07:47,291
Oh my God.
Again,

2850
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:49,990
chased by a giraffe.
Look at the girl's face.

2851
02:07:49,991 --> 02:07:52,450
She's fucking panicking.
Holy Shit.

2852
02:07:52,510 --> 02:07:54,000
There really aren't getting chased.
Yeah,

2853
02:07:54,070 --> 02:07:55,960
that's legit.
It's not gonna be.

2854
02:07:55,961 --> 02:07:57,100
What do they do when they catch up to 
you?

2855
02:07:57,101 --> 02:07:59,110
They spit on you.
They licked the swing.

2856
02:07:59,111 --> 02:08:01,150
Their heads like a,
like a weapon.

2857
02:08:01,180 --> 02:08:02,830
Swinging it at me.
I'll knock you the fuck out.

2858
02:08:02,970 --> 02:08:03,830
Oh,
totally.

2859
02:08:04,660 --> 02:08:08,590
I'm riding one of those things,
so I keep telling my kids I am writing a

2860
02:08:08,591 --> 02:08:09,490
giraffe like,
dad,

2861
02:08:09,491 --> 02:08:11,350
you can't ride giraffes.
Don't try.

2862
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:12,310
You can.
You can do it.

2863
02:08:12,311 --> 02:08:15,160
I'm going to do it.
That's especially wild ones.

2864
02:08:15,161 --> 02:08:18,280
Mom,
did they really argue with that?

2865
02:08:20,730 --> 02:08:22,680
So we keep it going.
I haven't pictured,

2866
02:08:22,830 --> 02:08:26,220
we were at the San Diego Zoo recently or
the Santa Barbara Zoo and I'm,

2867
02:08:26,250 --> 02:08:28,740
it's a good one.
They drafts are one of the few animals.

2868
02:08:28,741 --> 02:08:30,410
I actually had a bit about this in my 
act.

2869
02:08:30,690 --> 02:08:33,900
The one of the few animals that I think 
are better off in captivity because they

2870
02:08:33,901 --> 02:08:34,734
don't,
they don't give a fuck like other 

2871
02:08:35,911 --> 02:08:37,440
animals,
like so sad,

2872
02:08:37,680 --> 02:08:38,513
but giraffes another day with no lions 
and they just wander around like they 

2873
02:08:42,391 --> 02:08:44,790
don't seem to mind at all.
Like their behavior,

2874
02:08:45,030 --> 02:08:45,863
their behavior is so predictable that 
they let babies feed them or hold up a 

2875
02:08:50,401 --> 02:08:51,234
piece of leaf and a baby will come over 
and take it from the draft will come 

2876
02:08:55,051 --> 02:08:56,420
over and take it from the baby.
No,

2877
02:08:56,450 --> 02:08:59,220
they're just,
they're just really chilled out animals.

2878
02:09:00,270 --> 02:09:03,090
But here's the other thing,
but they,

2879
02:09:03,091 --> 02:09:06,630
they're fucking mean to other drafts.
They fight to the death.

2880
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:07,553
They beat the shit out of each other 
with those lumps on the top of their 

2881
02:09:09,151 --> 02:09:10,170
heads,
swing it.

2882
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:11,573
And one of the other things they do,
they keep food away from younger 

2883
02:09:14,281 --> 02:09:15,114
giraffes.
And the way they do it as they eat all 

2884
02:09:16,891 --> 02:09:17,724
the low hanging leaves and they do it to
try to purposely starve out other 

2885
02:09:22,411 --> 02:09:23,580
giraffes.
Really?

2886
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:25,170
Yeah.
It's kind of fucked up,

2887
02:09:25,171 --> 02:09:26,250
man.
They're arrogant.

2888
02:09:26,730 --> 02:09:27,563
Well,
they'll eat lower leaves even though 

2889
02:09:28,741 --> 02:09:29,574
they can reach the higher ones.
They eat lower leaves and it's 

2890
02:09:31,741 --> 02:09:32,574
speculated,
they do it because of competition for 

2891
02:09:33,901 --> 02:09:34,734
food that they want to like literally 
box out these giraffes and let them 

2892
02:09:37,081 --> 02:09:37,860
starve to death.

2893
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:38,870
She's,
well,

2894
02:09:38,871 --> 02:09:40,970
that's the thing that everything's been,
a friend of mine went,

2895
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:43,430
everything's mean.
A friend of mine went and,

2896
02:09:43,431 --> 02:09:45,860
uh,
they have a similar problem that I have,

2897
02:09:45,861 --> 02:09:48,050
which I have a cat that's just a killing
machine.

2898
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:51,710
Just kills.
Not every day just birds.

2899
02:09:51,711 --> 02:09:52,880
You let it out.
Birds,

2900
02:09:52,881 --> 02:09:55,220
lizards,
you can't keep it in.

2901
02:09:55,221 --> 02:09:59,200
It's a while now.
It just wants nonstop.

2902
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:01,010
It's like,
I'm going outside,

2903
02:10:01,011 --> 02:10:02,930
so,
you know,

2904
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:07,850
so we're kind of freaked out and were 
like trying to stop it and putting bells

2905
02:10:07,851 --> 02:10:08,684
on it.
And this,

2906
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:11,240
my friend had the same thing with it's 
cat.

2907
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:13,940
And uh,
went to Africa,

2908
02:10:13,941 --> 02:10:16,070
came back and said everything needs 
everything.

2909
02:10:16,071 --> 02:10:16,904
I don't care.
It's just like it put everything in 

2910
02:10:18,261 --> 02:10:19,094
perspective.
It's just like this is how the world 

2911
02:10:20,391 --> 02:10:21,070
works.

2912
02:10:21,070 --> 02:10:21,903
Well,
this is how certainly how nature got to 

2913
02:10:23,051 --> 02:10:27,760
2016 to 2016 by everybody just waiting 
in line for food.

2914
02:10:27,790 --> 02:10:28,900
Being polite.
Yeah.

2915
02:10:28,930 --> 02:10:32,050
There's a number that they put at house 
cats.

2916
02:10:32,290 --> 02:10:36,090
How many animals they kill every year.
And just in North America it's billions.

2917
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:38,780
Billions,
billions in birds and in mammals.

2918
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:39,633
Yeah.
Billions of birds and billions of 

2919
02:10:40,970 --> 02:10:42,690
mammals.
There are just ruthless little fucker ar

2920
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:43,673
and people are complaining now because 
they've heard the stats and they're 

2921
02:10:45,741 --> 02:10:47,150
like,
you shouldn't let your cats out.

2922
02:10:47,151 --> 02:10:47,984
And you guys,
it's just nature's cleanups the way it 

2923
02:10:49,671 --> 02:10:51,710
goes.
That's how nature works.

2924
02:10:51,711 --> 02:10:52,120
Loved.
He'd,

2925
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:54,380
they didn't do that though.
If they didn't have those instincts,

2926
02:10:54,410 --> 02:10:56,930
honestly like coyotes have coyotes were 
now out there doing that.

2927
02:10:56,931 --> 02:10:58,700
If all these animals were now not there 
doing that,

2928
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:00,950
we would be overrun with rodents.
First of all,

2929
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:02,113
it'd be mice everywhere cause it'd be 
nothing to eat them if it weren't for 

2930
02:11:04,821 --> 02:11:06,110
birds and hawks.

2931
02:11:06,110 --> 02:11:06,943
And it'd be like living in the bronx.
We have this issue at our house where 

2932
02:11:09,801 --> 02:11:10,640
we,
um,

2933
02:11:10,910 --> 02:11:15,830
we just recently installed this fence 
and our backyard that's glass.

2934
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:19,430
And we used to have a metal fence there,
but now it's a glass fence and the hawks

2935
02:11:19,431 --> 02:11:20,264
haven't figured it out yet.
So every now and then you hear it and 

2936
02:11:23,961 --> 02:11:25,580
we'll go out and sign in for what do you
have?

2937
02:11:25,581 --> 02:11:27,630
They're swooping down to kill Shit.
What do you got?

2938
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:29,510
Chickens.
But they're not killing the chickens,

2939
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:33,020
but one did disappear that we can't 
totally put a finger on what happened to

2940
02:11:33,021 --> 02:11:33,854
it.
Oh yeah.

2941
02:11:33,890 --> 02:11:35,240
It could have been a coyote though.
Yeah,

2942
02:11:35,241 --> 02:11:37,790
that'd be bird and bird.
We've seen the bird and bird.

2943
02:11:37,791 --> 02:11:39,020
Super Common.
Yeah.

2944
02:11:39,230 --> 02:11:40,063
Yeah.
It's like black on black crime and no 

2945
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:44,500
one wants to talk about it.
It happens.

2946
02:11:45,230 --> 02:11:48,470
But a friend of mine was sitting in his 
backyard and he watched a,

2947
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:50,900
a a hawk come down scuba dove.

2948
02:11:51,210 --> 02:11:52,043
He said a dove was just sitting there 
just chill and all of a sudden really 

2949
02:11:55,071 --> 02:11:56,510
said it happened like 20 feet from his 
face.

2950
02:11:57,520 --> 02:11:59,510
He was like,
what the fuck man,

2951
02:11:59,780 --> 02:12:04,250
this wrapped or just came down from the 
sky and they take pets,

2952
02:12:04,510 --> 02:12:06,350
but so he's hawks,
they swooped down,

2953
02:12:06,610 --> 02:12:07,443
you know when they're looking for things
and then they're looking to make their 

2954
02:12:09,021 --> 02:12:11,540
approach and they just get k the fuck 
owed.

2955
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:12,520
Oh really?
Yeah.

2956
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:14,300
Sometimes they die.
Like we've had,

2957
02:12:14,301 --> 02:12:17,660
one of them died on us,
but one of them we had to take two,

2958
02:12:17,661 --> 02:12:18,494
one of those um,
wildlife like rescue places and they 

2959
02:12:21,921 --> 02:12:22,754
fixed it up and took care of it.
And then another one recently got 

2960
02:12:25,671 --> 02:12:28,090
knocked the fuck out.
Sat there was a pretty big hawk to yeah.

2961
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:30,620
And my wife took video of it like,
hey buddy,

2962
02:12:30,621 --> 02:12:32,030
how you doing?
You Alright?

2963
02:12:32,110 --> 02:12:34,010
Back up girls.
And uh,

2964
02:12:34,011 --> 02:12:34,844
after she took video of it,
the thing eventually got ghost and Woca 

2965
02:12:37,610 --> 02:12:41,120
fuck up and flew away,
but to coyotes come after the chickens.

2966
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:41,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

2967
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:44,720
We lost one pretty recently.
I watched it happen.

2968
02:12:44,721 --> 02:12:47,480
I watched the coyote hop over the fence.
Oh really?

2969
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:49,670
It was weird.
Hopped over the fence,

2970
02:12:49,671 --> 02:12:51,020
hopped over the fence.
Fence.

2971
02:12:51,620 --> 02:12:54,530
I'm six feet.
What?

2972
02:12:54,590 --> 02:12:56,240
Yeah.
Hopped over it like it was nothing.

2973
02:12:56,420 --> 02:12:59,060
I mean,
just went right over the top there.

2974
02:12:59,061 --> 02:13:01,430
They're super,
super agile man.

2975
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:03,380
Like in a weird way.
Like you're like,

2976
02:13:03,381 --> 02:13:05,390
wait a minute.
I didn't know you could do that.

2977
02:13:06,910 --> 02:13:09,740
If it went over that fence,
like it was nothing.

2978
02:13:09,741 --> 02:13:11,060
I'm trying to find the video.
Here it is.

2979
02:13:11,390 --> 02:13:13,820
This is the one or my wife was talking 
to it.

2980
02:13:13,850 --> 02:13:18,850
Look at that thing.
That's just a hawk.

2981
02:13:22,371 --> 02:13:25,160
See it in front of the glass.
He's just chilling.

2982
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:26,930
It's a big ass fucking hawk.
Yeah,

2983
02:13:26,970 --> 02:13:27,711
it's big.
Yeah,

2984
02:13:27,711 --> 02:13:30,140
he survived.
It looks like you live in the Amazon.

2985
02:13:30,290 --> 02:13:32,070
It looks like it.
He survived,

2986
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:34,860
but he got fucking crack.
Really?

2987
02:13:34,861 --> 02:13:38,230
Just apply full speed right into this.
Doug.

2988
02:13:38,730 --> 02:13:41,760
Maybe you got to put some stickers on it
or something like if your grandma,

2989
02:13:41,761 --> 02:13:43,740
so she has to go through the slide.
Think last tour.

2990
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:48,360
Put in Marge Simpson picture on it.
Found this video.

2991
02:13:48,370 --> 02:13:51,810
I was looking for a hawks swooping.
If people let a little bunny go.

2992
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:53,290
Oh No,
I've seen that.

2993
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:55,180
Five seconds later.
Oh,

2994
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:56,033
little girl.
Little cute girl with a little bunny 

2995
02:13:58,111 --> 02:13:59,790
rabbit.
Oh No.

2996
02:14:07,390 --> 02:14:12,390
Ah God,
instantly that thing just flew in.

2997
02:14:14,721 --> 02:14:17,470
She's asking where it's mommy is and 
then a raptor.

2998
02:14:19,270 --> 02:14:23,140
I mean that's in some ways it's cool.
Some ways I think that's beautiful,

2999
02:14:23,141 --> 02:14:25,150
but in other ways like yeah,
the baby's cute,

3000
02:14:25,151 --> 02:14:25,984
but what is it about us where when we 
look at like very small versions of 

3001
02:14:30,401 --> 02:14:31,234
animals,
like I had a picture of the other day 

3002
02:14:31,991 --> 02:14:32,824
that I put up on my instagram of this 
giant grizzly bear with her three cubs 

3003
02:14:36,790 --> 02:14:37,690
and I was like,
God,

3004
02:14:37,691 --> 02:14:39,680
look how adorable those little cubs,
others,

3005
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:40,953
beautiful.
But what is going on with us where we 

3006
02:14:43,301 --> 02:14:44,960
see these little things?
What,

3007
02:14:44,980 --> 02:14:47,110
what is cute?
Like in quotes,

3008
02:14:47,111 --> 02:14:50,140
like look at that picture.
It's a genetic thing.

3009
02:14:50,450 --> 02:14:52,810
It's,
it keeps us from wanting to kill them.

3010
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:54,970
It's our genes and also to protect our 
own.

3011
02:14:54,990 --> 02:14:56,620
Yeah.
So just let them thrive.

3012
02:14:56,670 --> 02:14:59,920
I mean you see a baby,
you want to protect it,

3013
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:03,760
but like when you lose like that's why 
like whenever the,

3014
02:15:04,150 --> 02:15:04,983
when that Connecticut school shooting 
was like these tiny kids like 

3015
02:15:07,211 --> 02:15:08,050
kindergarten,
right.

3016
02:15:08,110 --> 02:15:08,943
That was such a mind blowing thing 
because those are the faces we want to 

3017
02:15:12,161 --> 02:15:13,930
protect.
You know?

3018
02:15:14,650 --> 02:15:16,750
It's just the instinct.
Yeah,

3019
02:15:16,751 --> 02:15:20,740
and there's your instinct.
There's so many crazy fuckers that don't

3020
02:15:20,741 --> 02:15:24,040
believe that that really happened play.
Have you seen any of that?

3021
02:15:24,041 --> 02:15:26,920
The like people that like thing to deny 
or is that these,

3022
02:15:26,921 --> 02:15:30,460
all these school shootings are like 
false flags.

3023
02:15:30,920 --> 02:15:31,753
Like do you really think that you can 
get all those families to lie about 

3024
02:15:34,391 --> 02:15:35,800
losing their kids?
Exactly.

3025
02:15:35,980 --> 02:15:37,900
These families are all operatives.
Yeah.

3026
02:15:37,930 --> 02:15:39,880
They're all so CIA,
please.

3027
02:15:39,881 --> 02:15:42,970
People are so shitty.
People always talk always.

3028
02:15:43,390 --> 02:15:45,570
There's no way you can organize them.
Maybe that's me,

3029
02:15:45,930 --> 02:15:46,763
but to keep a secret,
but it's just amazing that people 

3030
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:52,780
actually would believe that that would 
be something they would entertain there.

3031
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:57,520
Mutans that's against nature to see this
thing and not like,

3032
02:15:57,521 --> 02:15:59,920
how do we make sure this doesn't happen 
again?

3033
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:02,110
When your head goes to,
it's a lie.

3034
02:16:02,111 --> 02:16:04,060
We're going to go to fleet.
This.

3035
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:04,933
There's a weird thing with people.
They want to believe that a lot of 

3036
02:16:06,911 --> 02:16:08,980
things are lies.
Like a lot of things.

3037
02:16:09,110 --> 02:16:10,750
Yeah.
Because the eye,

3038
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:14,710
the admitting that it happens is 
admitting it's chaos.

3039
02:16:14,740 --> 02:16:17,860
But this weird shit going on today,
like because of the Internet,

3040
02:16:18,370 --> 02:16:19,203
people have these forums and these 
youtube pages where they make up this 

3041
02:16:22,031 --> 02:16:25,720
nonsense.
I saw a guy the other day was who was a,

3042
02:16:25,930 --> 02:16:29,860
he's a flat earth guy and uh,
he had a video about how are a hoax?

3043
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:32,660
2016.
Yeah.

3044
02:16:32,830 --> 02:16:34,540
Video about dinosaurs being a hug.
So I'm like,

3045
02:16:34,541 --> 02:16:35,380
wait a minute,
wait a minute,

3046
02:16:35,381 --> 02:16:36,010
wait a minute,
wait in,

3047
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:36,843
wait and wait and wait and went away.
So all these paleontologists for like 

3048
02:16:39,941 --> 02:16:42,480
what 150 years have all been foolish.

3049
02:16:42,580 --> 02:16:43,480
Yeah.
All in on it.

3050
02:16:43,610 --> 02:16:44,670
All in all,
my name's Darren,

3051
02:16:44,810 --> 02:16:45,820
generation to generation

3052
02:16:46,030 --> 02:16:48,190
also doesn't believe that satellites are
real,

3053
02:16:48,270 --> 02:16:50,350
right?
Satellites are not real.

3054
02:16:50,380 --> 02:16:53,200
They're really what's going on.
We have planes and the planes are flying

3055
02:16:53,201 --> 02:16:55,300
very high and they stay in orbit and 
those are,

3056
02:16:55,301 --> 02:16:56,740
they're transmitting the signal

3057
02:16:58,670 --> 02:17:01,790
lord and the world's flat.
This is a real problem though.

3058
02:17:01,850 --> 02:17:02,780
And no,
I mean,

3059
02:17:02,781 --> 02:17:05,960
because that's the extreme part of it.
Like those people really believe that.

3060
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:07,190
And well,
majority of people do,

3061
02:17:07,670 --> 02:17:10,610
but just basic thing,
there is no truth.

3062
02:17:10,640 --> 02:17:11,473
The Internet is,
is devouring truth sort of that there 

3063
02:17:14,650 --> 02:17:15,483
that you can literally have real 
intelligent people just talking about 

3064
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:21,050
unemployment rates.
Just talking about the government,

3065
02:17:21,051 --> 02:17:23,270
just talking about how the economy's 
doing,

3066
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:25,840
right,
and you can have people saying be there,

3067
02:17:26,090 --> 02:17:26,923
it's been lowered to below 5% of 
unemployment and other people are 

3068
02:17:30,381 --> 02:17:31,640
saying,
no,

3069
02:17:31,641 --> 02:17:35,060
that is completely wrong and flight.
These numbers are complete and these are

3070
02:17:35,180 --> 02:17:40,180
two groups of intelligent people with 
degrees and putting out these facts.

3071
02:17:43,881 --> 02:17:45,440
It's the same thing as the official hill
thing.

3072
02:17:45,620 --> 02:17:49,160
It's like I can look up,
you can any fact you want to bring up,

3073
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:50,353
you go on the Internet and you'll find 
the opposite and not from like what 

3074
02:17:53,871 --> 02:17:57,440
looks like crazy people.
The truth is,

3075
02:17:57,441 --> 02:17:58,520
I mean what is the truth?

3076
02:17:58,710 --> 02:18:03,710
I think right now what's happening is 
virtually anybody can start a website or

3077
02:18:06,010 --> 02:18:06,843
a twitter page or whatever and say 
anything they want and they don't have 

3078
02:18:09,761 --> 02:18:10,880
to be correct.
Right?

3079
02:18:10,990 --> 02:18:14,980
But if they convince enough people,
they'll get a following and then through

3080
02:18:14,981 --> 02:18:15,814
that following they can get a bunch of 
people that get confirmation bias and 

3081
02:18:19,271 --> 02:18:22,540
only look into the information that 
supports all this craziness.

3082
02:18:22,950 --> 02:18:26,020
No satellites and the earth is flat,
all that nonsense.

3083
02:18:26,290 --> 02:18:27,123
But I think this is almost like a 
temporary blip in our road to absorbing 

3084
02:18:30,701 --> 02:18:31,534
information.
I think right now information is coming 

3085
02:18:33,701 --> 02:18:36,460
from a bunch of different sources.
Lots of them legit,

3086
02:18:36,461 --> 02:18:37,294
most of them are legit,
but then some of them that are just 

3087
02:18:38,531 --> 02:18:39,364
really wacky like this where it gets the
sidetrack thing where people just start 

3088
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:43,593
thinking about chem trails are thinking 
about ufo abductions and getting 

3089
02:18:46,390 --> 02:18:47,223
absorbed in it.

3090
02:18:47,470 --> 02:18:48,303
But I think one of the next stages of 
disbursement of information is going to 

3091
02:18:52,271 --> 02:18:57,271
be direct brain to brain and I think 
we're going to share information in some

3092
02:18:58,001 --> 02:18:58,834
way that is as alien to us as the 
Internet would have been to people that 

3093
02:19:01,451 --> 02:19:02,284
live to 150 years ago.
Like if you tried to explain google to 

3094
02:19:05,451 --> 02:19:07,330
someone who lived to 150 years ago,
they'd be like,

3095
02:19:07,331 --> 02:19:10,200
you're out of your fucking mind.
That is never going to happen forever.

3096
02:19:10,300 --> 02:19:11,470
But to us it's like,
well,

3097
02:19:11,471 --> 02:19:13,090
Google at Jamie,
you know,

3098
02:19:13,091 --> 02:19:14,820
it's like it becomes normal,
right?

3099
02:19:15,070 --> 02:19:18,670
Well,
I think the next stage of that is you're

3100
02:19:18,671 --> 02:19:19,504
going to be able to access information 
that directly comes from someone's mind 

3101
02:19:23,470 --> 02:19:27,500
and meaning that you're going to be able
to share thoughts.

3102
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:28,513
I think thoughts are going to be,
they're going to figure out a way to 

3103
02:19:31,641 --> 02:19:32,474
take whatever frequency and whatever 
signal that a thought is and you're 

3104
02:19:37,281 --> 02:19:38,114
going to be able to condense it and 
project it and send it to people and 

3105
02:19:41,810 --> 02:19:44,870
you're going to be able to access other 
people's thoughts and you're going to be

3106
02:19:44,871 --> 02:19:47,810
able to know what's truthful and what's 
not.

3107
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:49,190
It's not going to be a matter of,
boy,

3108
02:19:49,191 --> 02:19:50,900
I hope this guy's telling the truth.
You're going to,

3109
02:19:50,901 --> 02:19:55,220
you're going to be able to know like 
pretty pretty much instantaneously.

3110
02:19:55,430 --> 02:19:59,180
I think that's whether it's a hundred 
years from now or 200 years from now,

3111
02:19:59,270 --> 02:20:00,103
but all in all,
if you look at like the Roman empire or 

3112
02:20:02,890 --> 02:20:03,723
you know,
look at like long periods of time where 

3113
02:20:06,261 --> 02:20:09,080
one group dominated one aspect of 
civilization,

3114
02:20:09,350 --> 02:20:12,680
a hundred years ain't shit,
but to us a hundred years ago,

3115
02:20:12,681 --> 02:20:15,500
1916 it's like,
might as well be Mars.

3116
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:17,660
They might as well be from another 
world,

3117
02:20:18,020 --> 02:20:18,853
you know?
But that go back to your marriage thing 

3118
02:20:20,991 --> 02:20:24,170
of what your wife is thinking when she's
having sex with you.

3119
02:20:24,230 --> 02:20:25,140
You're going to no,
no,

3120
02:20:25,141 --> 02:20:27,170
no.
You got to see the crazy people can send

3121
02:20:27,171 --> 02:20:28,004
their thoughts just as easily is a no 
because you don't necessarily have to 

3122
02:20:32,260 --> 02:20:35,330
share in those thoughts,
but I just think that you'll,

3123
02:20:35,331 --> 02:20:36,164
you'll be able to look,
these are obviously science fiction 

3124
02:20:37,911 --> 02:20:38,744
notions right now,
but I think that when you send a text 

3125
02:20:43,221 --> 02:20:46,760
message to someone or put out a tweet or
a facebook message,

3126
02:20:47,150 --> 02:20:47,983
you're essentially condensing a thought 
into some sort of a digital 

3127
02:20:50,631 --> 02:20:52,130
representation of that thought.

3128
02:20:52,130 --> 02:20:54,040
And then you know,
you use the right language,

3129
02:20:54,070 --> 02:20:54,903
then you send it out there.
I think that what's going to happen is 

3130
02:20:57,201 --> 02:20:58,034
it's going to be direct thought to 
thought we're going to be able to 

3131
02:20:59,901 --> 02:21:03,050
interpret thoughts and then we're gonna 
just,

3132
02:21:03,140 --> 02:21:03,973
we're going to be able to know whether 
or not someone is actually being honest 

3133
02:21:06,951 --> 02:21:07,940
or they're,
they're bullshitting,

3134
02:21:07,970 --> 02:21:09,710
right?
I think,

3135
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:11,270
I mean,
I think in our careers,

3136
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:14,420
well that's what they say.
This is an extension of your brain.

3137
02:21:14,421 --> 02:21:17,060
This is my brain to this brain,
to your brain.

3138
02:21:17,090 --> 02:21:17,810
Right?
Right.

3139
02:21:17,810 --> 02:21:18,643
Yeah.
So it makes sense that you're going to 

3140
02:21:19,641 --> 02:21:21,200
bridge that gap.
That is a bridge,

3141
02:21:21,290 --> 02:21:22,123
right?
It's a bridge to minds and information 

3142
02:21:24,381 --> 02:21:25,970
and ideas.
It really is,

3143
02:21:25,971 --> 02:21:28,550
and a lot of ways,
and I think this is just one step.

3144
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:29,653
As technology exponentially grows,
we're not just gonna accept typing 

3145
02:21:33,891 --> 02:21:34,724
things into a glass screen that will 
eventually be send and then put it up 

3146
02:21:38,031 --> 02:21:38,210
there.

3147
02:21:38,210 --> 02:21:40,340
It's going to be more complex.
It's going to get better.

3148
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:41,353
They're going to figure out new ways to 
integrate that technology into human 

3149
02:21:44,361 --> 02:21:46,490
bodies.
That's going to be really weird,

3150
02:21:46,491 --> 02:21:49,130
like neural implants.
And things along those lines going to be

3151
02:21:49,131 --> 02:21:51,110
really wild because when they figured 
out like,

3152
02:21:51,140 --> 02:21:52,280
see,
you wear glasses,

3153
02:21:52,310 --> 02:21:53,990
right?
One day they're going to say,

3154
02:21:53,991 --> 02:21:57,020
listen Tom,
you don't have to wear glasses.

3155
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:01,160
All we have to do is install one of 
these new internet neural apps.

3156
02:22:01,550 --> 02:22:04,460
And once we do do that,
you'll be able to see crystal clear.

3157
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:08,120
There's a way that this neural APP 
reworks the synapses,

3158
02:22:08,190 --> 02:22:09,023
right?
It changes the way your eyeballs 

3159
02:22:11,030 --> 02:22:11,863
interpret the cones and rods interpret 
the world around you and you gonna be 

3160
02:22:15,021 --> 02:22:16,050
able to change it.
Yeah,

3161
02:22:16,051 --> 02:22:18,170
but I think they look good in glasses.
Look awesome.

3162
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:21,080
You look smarter.
It's true.

3163
02:22:21,230 --> 02:22:22,760
Why don't you look smarter when you have
glasses?

3164
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:24,380
Um,
I don't know.

3165
02:22:24,410 --> 02:22:26,010
Everybody does like chicks.
Chicks

3166
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:26,990
look way smarter.
Yeah.

3167
02:22:27,450 --> 02:22:30,180
I don't know why that is.
Dante though.

3168
02:22:30,990 --> 02:22:32,790
It depends on the glasses.
Dudes look,

3169
02:22:32,791 --> 02:22:33,990
look you,
you know,

3170
02:22:34,330 --> 02:22:39,330
when you can't see good crosses,
smarter throws a glass.

3171
02:22:40,050 --> 02:22:41,910
I don't assume that they have something 
wrong with her eyes,

3172
02:22:41,911 --> 02:22:42,750
I assume.
Oh,

3173
02:22:42,751 --> 02:22:45,840
she's smart.
She's clever.

3174
02:22:46,050 --> 02:22:47,850
But then Sarah Pailin fucked all that 
up.

3175
02:22:47,880 --> 02:22:49,400
Yeah.
She says,

3176
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:50,910
oh,
check glasses.

3177
02:22:50,940 --> 02:22:52,170
Yeah.
And she's more on,

3178
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:53,910
yeah,
she just dumps that bear.

3179
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:58,150
No,
but don't do the,

3180
02:22:59,370 --> 02:23:02,820
she's a trump supporter.
She's a real trump supporter.

3181
02:23:03,450 --> 02:23:07,110
I fucking trump supporter you liberal 
piece of shit.

3182
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:09,230
Do you think he's going to win?
I,

3183
02:23:09,340 --> 02:23:10,560
I,
you know what,

3184
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:15,390
I talked to a lot of people who think 
it's an impossibility,

3185
02:23:16,140 --> 02:23:19,530
but the further we go down the road,
I think he's coming.

3186
02:23:19,531 --> 02:23:21,570
And I think that it's a real 
possibility.

3187
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:23,030
It's a real possibility.
But you know,

3188
02:23:23,031 --> 02:23:25,140
and I think if I was a conspiracy 
theorist,

3189
02:23:25,141 --> 02:23:25,974
but I'm not,
I would say that what Donald Trump is 

3190
02:23:27,661 --> 02:23:32,661
doing is making us happy about Hillary 
Clinton being president because it's the

3191
02:23:33,661 --> 02:23:37,890
only way we're going to be happy about 
Hillary Clinton being president.

3192
02:23:37,890 --> 02:23:38,723
Right?
Like Hillary Clinton represents the 

3193
02:23:40,171 --> 02:23:45,030
establishment in about as clear a form 
as we've ever seen before.

3194
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:46,290
Right.
No question.

3195
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:47,251
No.
And you know,

3196
02:23:47,251 --> 02:23:48,084
she's,
she's intelligent and when she was 

3197
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:52,110
secretary of state,
both sides liked her.

3198
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:52,993
They was like,
she was really positive reviews from 

3199
02:23:54,091 --> 02:23:55,560
everybody.
But you're right,

3200
02:23:55,561 --> 02:23:58,380
it's exactly the same old,
same old you ever talk about,

3201
02:23:58,381 --> 02:24:01,530
or you ever read the Secret Service?
Talk about guarding her.

3202
02:24:02,370 --> 02:24:04,440
They think she's a sociopath.
I said,

3203
02:24:04,460 --> 02:24:05,310
Shit.
Yeah.

3204
02:24:05,311 --> 02:24:06,270
They said,
first of all,

3205
02:24:06,271 --> 02:24:10,650
she doesn't thank anyone and she doesn't
talk to them that guard her 24,

3206
02:24:10,651 --> 02:24:13,650
seven and she doesn't talk to them.
They say there's a guy who,

3207
02:24:13,651 --> 02:24:15,040
uh,
was one of her secrets.

3208
02:24:15,041 --> 02:24:16,830
I mean,
he bought be a fucking idiot.

3209
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:19,380
Who knows?
He might be in one guy's report.

3210
02:24:19,770 --> 02:24:20,603
Yeah,
right.

3211
02:24:20,850 --> 02:24:21,683
I think there's more than one,
but the reports were that she's just 

3212
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:25,950
some creepy about her.

3213
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:26,881
Right.
Well,

3214
02:24:26,881 --> 02:24:28,950
there's some creepy about everybody.
That's another thing.

3215
02:24:28,980 --> 02:24:29,813
Problem with the idea that you're gonna 
find one perfect person is so off the 

3216
02:24:34,201 --> 02:24:35,034
charts.
I mean,

3217
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:36,690
everybody's flawed.
Everybody's,

3218
02:24:36,691 --> 02:24:38,670
you know,
and especially if you play that game for

3219
02:24:38,671 --> 02:24:40,380
that long,
you're going to be dirty.

3220
02:24:40,381 --> 02:24:41,214
You're going to be duplicitous.
But that's part of what you've got to 

3221
02:24:43,441 --> 02:24:44,120
be.
Yeah.

3222
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:45,870
That game.
That's a dark game.

3223
02:24:45,871 --> 02:24:46,704
It's a dark game.
Did you ever see the video of her 

3224
02:24:48,151 --> 02:24:51,150
talking about Kadafi she's laughing.
We came,

3225
02:24:51,151 --> 02:24:53,220
we conquered.
He died or came,

3226
02:24:53,221 --> 02:24:54,690
we saw he died.
Really?

3227
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:56,250
Yeah.
And she's laughing.

3228
02:24:56,251 --> 02:24:59,670
She's doing an interview in off camera 
before they interview or they're rolling

3229
02:24:59,671 --> 02:25:00,504
the camera while they're talking to her 
and she's laughing about Kadafi dying 

3230
02:25:04,801 --> 02:25:05,640
and you're like,
Whoa,

3231
02:25:05,670 --> 02:25:06,600
wait,
what?

3232
02:25:07,350 --> 02:25:09,750
Hold on.
Who is the person that we see that's all

3233
02:25:09,751 --> 02:25:10,584
measured and calm?
Like that's not you for real cause that 

3234
02:25:13,011 --> 02:25:13,860
a act.
Right.

3235
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:17,100
Cause she was like throwing her head 
back laughing.

3236
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:19,590
Oh boy.
And this is really weird way.

3237
02:25:19,591 --> 02:25:20,640
Like watch this,
watch this.

3238
02:25:21,330 --> 02:25:22,890
Hold on.
Go all the way from the beginning.

3239
02:25:23,670 --> 02:25:24,010
So

3240
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:26,620
I mean that is the land of unconfirmed.
Yes,

3241
02:25:26,650 --> 02:25:29,410
we came,
we saw he died.

3242
02:25:30,950 --> 02:25:32,680
Did it have anything to do with your 
visit?

3243
02:25:32,770 --> 02:25:34,080
No.
I'm sure it yet.

3244
02:25:36,030 --> 02:25:38,010
Whoa,
that's a little weird.

3245
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:39,013
Well it's not jazz or weird.
It's strange what the Hillary Clinton 

3246
02:25:41,581 --> 02:25:46,470
lying for 13 minutes straight.
We're sad about play that real quick.

3247
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:48,473
But I think what you said so far,
it's super important that no one's 

3248
02:25:51,511 --> 02:25:52,500
perfect.
Yeah.

3249
02:25:52,550 --> 02:25:53,940
And,
and not only that,

3250
02:25:53,941 --> 02:25:56,010
this business.
Yeah.

3251
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:58,970
Mama's the immigration policies.
Now you say they're too harsh.

3252
02:25:59,220 --> 02:26:01,310
You supported his trade deal dozens of 
times.

3253
02:26:01,311 --> 02:26:04,190
You even called it the gold standard.
Now suddenly last week,

3254
02:26:04,191 --> 02:26:06,470
you're against it.
Will you say anything to get elected?

3255
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:07,553
Well,
actually I have been very consistent 

3256
02:26:08,611 --> 02:26:12,630
over the course of my entire life.
I have always fought for the same values

3257
02:26:12,631 --> 02:26:14,010
and principles.
Looking at him.

3258
02:26:15,170 --> 02:26:17,430
Do you think New York state should 
recognize gay?

3259
02:26:18,010 --> 02:26:20,070
Oh No.
Okay.

3260
02:26:23,070 --> 02:26:28,070
I believe that marriage is not just a 
bond,

3261
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:31,740
but a sacred bond between a man and a 
woman.

3262
02:26:31,741 --> 02:26:33,760
2004.
I have uh,

3263
02:26:33,810 --> 02:26:38,460
not to support it.
Same sex marriage and civil partnerships

3264
02:26:38,490 --> 02:26:39,323
and a contractual relationships.
I support marriage for lesbian and gay 

3265
02:26:43,891 --> 02:26:44,724
couples,
2013 Ford it personally and as a matter 

3266
02:26:47,941 --> 02:26:48,774
of policy and law.
So you're saying your opinion on gay 

3267
02:26:50,881 --> 02:26:54,780
marriage changed or you changed your 
mind because you know,

3268
02:26:54,781 --> 02:26:57,060
I really,
I have to say I think you are,

3269
02:26:57,090 --> 02:26:58,860
um,
it was very persistent,

3270
02:26:58,890 --> 02:26:59,723
but you are playing with my words and 
playing with what is such and I'm just 

3271
02:27:03,271 --> 02:27:05,010
trying to clarify so I can understand.

3272
02:27:05,010 --> 02:27:06,840
No,
I don't think you are trying to clarify.

3273
02:27:06,841 --> 02:27:08,310
I think you're trying to say that,
you know,

3274
02:27:08,311 --> 02:27:13,230
I used to be a opposed and now I'm in 
favor and I did it for political reasons

3275
02:27:13,231 --> 02:27:14,064
and that's just flat wrong.
So let me just state what I feel like 

3276
02:27:15,841 --> 02:27:20,700
you are implying and repudiate it.
I have a strong record.

3277
02:27:20,730 --> 02:27:25,730
I have a great commitment to this issue 
and I am proud of what I've done and the

3278
02:27:26,641 --> 02:27:27,990
progress we're making.
No,

3279
02:27:27,991 --> 02:27:28,824
I'm just saying I'm sorry.
I just want to clarify what I was 

3280
02:27:30,451 --> 02:27:31,060
saying.
No,

3281
02:27:31,060 --> 02:27:33,750
I was saying that you maybe really 
believe this all along,

3282
02:27:33,751 --> 02:27:35,460
but you know,
believed in gay marriage all along,

3283
02:27:35,461 --> 02:27:36,294
but fault for political reasons.
America wasn't ready yet and you 

3284
02:27:38,521 --> 02:27:39,980
couldn't say it.
That's what I was saying.

3285
02:27:39,981 --> 02:27:41,130
No that,
no,

3286
02:27:41,250 --> 02:27:42,110
that is not true.
Okay.

3287
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:43,193
It really is great.
How long you've supported great gay 

3288
02:27:44,971 --> 02:27:46,020
marriage.
Yes.

3289
02:27:46,510 --> 02:27:48,330
I,
I could have supported it sooner.

3290
02:27:48,990 --> 02:27:52,380
Well you did it pretty soon.
It could have been sooner.

3291
02:27:52,930 --> 02:27:53,763
Fair point.

3292
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,440
Okay.
I think we've seen enough,

3293
02:27:57,500 --> 02:28:00,290
but you know,
so that's just a liar.

3294
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:02,430
No,
really,

3295
02:28:02,480 --> 02:28:05,000
that's a liar for sure.
You're alive.

3296
02:28:05,060 --> 02:28:06,680
But who is mine?
Terry Gross.

3297
02:28:06,681 --> 02:28:09,620
She was lying like in that interview was
she was saying that she always,

3298
02:28:09,710 --> 02:28:10,543
always supported that.
And I think old people forget that 

3299
02:28:13,041 --> 02:28:15,890
there's the internet.
They forget.

3300
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:19,010
They forget that when they said 
something in 2003 there's a videotape of

3301
02:28:19,011 --> 02:28:20,540
it.
You'd much rather hear,

3302
02:28:20,541 --> 02:28:21,800
just say,
yeah,

3303
02:28:21,801 --> 02:28:22,340
it was,

3304
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:23,173
yeah,
I was always,

3305
02:28:23,500 --> 02:28:26,180
I was against it because I didn't think 
America was ready for it.

3306
02:28:26,260 --> 02:28:26,600
And

3307
02:28:26,600 --> 02:28:28,560
or that she changed her own mind.
Right.

3308
02:28:28,561 --> 02:28:31,040
Changed my mind.
Just say you changed your mind.

3309
02:28:31,130 --> 02:28:34,010
I hate the term flip flopper right.
Because you can't evolve.

3310
02:28:34,100 --> 02:28:35,870
Everybody's a flip flopper.
Right.

3311
02:28:35,990 --> 02:28:36,823
If you're not,
then you're the same person you were 

3312
02:28:37,551 --> 02:28:38,750
when you were five.
Right?

3313
02:28:40,190 --> 02:28:41,023
That's right.
Let me tell you where I stand on the 

3314
02:28:43,791 --> 02:28:48,240
Santa thing.
No,

3315
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:49,520
you're right.
Right.

3316
02:28:49,521 --> 02:28:51,320
I mean,
so it's the end of the day like,

3317
02:28:51,321 --> 02:28:51,790
fuck,

3318
02:28:51,790 --> 02:28:54,550
but look at what you were now.
So now look what we're faced with.

3319
02:28:54,551 --> 02:28:55,384
You're faced with,
that's the big thing on her is that 

3320
02:28:57,521 --> 02:29:00,940
she's a liar and the,
and trump,

3321
02:29:01,450 --> 02:29:04,720
who is the biggest liar.
Right.

3322
02:29:05,350 --> 02:29:06,490
But you know what I mean?
But he,

3323
02:29:06,491 --> 02:29:08,860
but he at least says he,
he admits he's a liar.

3324
02:29:10,510 --> 02:29:11,343
What does he lied about?
Like what's been proven that he's lied 

3325
02:29:12,621 --> 02:29:13,700
about?
I'm sure there's been something,

3326
02:29:13,701 --> 02:29:16,070
but what has been,
he goes back and forth on everything and

3327
02:29:16,071 --> 02:29:17,390
he goes,
he'll about Mexicans.

3328
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:19,730
He's pretty strong on that.
Is Pretty strong in that,

3329
02:29:19,731 --> 02:29:21,500
but then says that,
uh,

3330
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:24,110
maybe that was just an idea.
Maybe that was just an idea.

3331
02:29:24,460 --> 02:29:26,030
So when he says recently,
yeah,

3332
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:27,650
maybe it was just an idea to put up the 
wall.

3333
02:29:27,950 --> 02:29:30,690
That was the thing that he sent in a,
well now he's in the home.

3334
02:29:30,691 --> 02:29:31,640
These tracks,
right?

3335
02:29:31,700 --> 02:29:33,430
Or at least he's rounding third.
Yeah,

3336
02:29:33,620 --> 02:29:34,970
he's rounding third.
Right.

3337
02:29:35,080 --> 02:29:37,250
And more approved.
Donald Trump is a serial liar.

3338
02:29:37,770 --> 02:29:39,200
It's how you what though?
He's got a hot wife,

3339
02:29:39,770 --> 02:29:44,770
so I don't know what to say because I am
a piece of shit.

3340
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:48,770
Like all man,
I'm a piece of shit.

3341
02:29:49,370 --> 02:29:54,000
Who's that broad you're with?
They keep one because his wife is hot.

3342
02:29:54,700 --> 02:29:56,360
I wouldn't mind that dame in the White 
House.

3343
02:29:56,361 --> 02:29:57,350
Okay.
Then right now,

3344
02:29:57,370 --> 02:29:59,840
hey,
Laurie Clinton's built like a box.

3345
02:30:01,150 --> 02:30:05,960
There are of course look lying to me.
Lying politician in linings.

3346
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:10,340
What kind of a baby are you that you 
think that these people don't lie?

3347
02:30:11,060 --> 02:30:13,310
Tell me one president other than Jimmy 
Carter,

3348
02:30:13,311 --> 02:30:17,300
perhaps that isn't a liar.
I don't think Obama is a lie.

3349
02:30:17,400 --> 02:30:20,580
I don't think Obama is a liar.
I do not think he's a liar.

3350
02:30:20,790 --> 02:30:21,623
I think that he has changed his position
on some things and I think that he said 

3351
02:30:23,941 --> 02:30:24,774
some things before he got into office 
that he wasn't really supporting or he 

3352
02:30:28,201 --> 02:30:29,820
didn't really support once he got in 
there.

3353
02:30:29,821 --> 02:30:33,270
But I think he is a remarkable person in
that.

3354
02:30:33,660 --> 02:30:37,650
As far as guys that have ever run for 
president or been present,

3355
02:30:38,130 --> 02:30:38,963
I like listening to him talk and I like 
his personality mall more than I think 

3356
02:30:42,271 --> 02:30:44,340
anybody that's ever run for president.
I've been president.

3357
02:30:44,360 --> 02:30:45,193
Yeah.
And people get mad at me for saying 

3358
02:30:45,721 --> 02:30:46,750
that.
Boom was,

3359
02:30:46,770 --> 02:30:47,880
what?
About what he's talking about?

3360
02:30:47,881 --> 02:30:49,210
Free speech.
Ooh Mama,

3361
02:30:50,400 --> 02:30:52,180
he did about whistleblowers.
Ooh,

3362
02:30:52,190 --> 02:30:54,030
boom.
I get it.

3363
02:30:54,060 --> 02:30:55,290
Yes.
Yes,

3364
02:30:55,291 --> 02:30:56,610
you're right.
Not Perfect.

3365
02:30:56,611 --> 02:30:57,444
Not,
not,

3366
02:30:57,930 --> 02:31:00,270
not even what I'm looking for.
He's not what I'm looking for.

3367
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:02,490
But right out of all the other people 
that have done it,

3368
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:03,450
I'm like,
man,

3369
02:31:03,640 --> 02:31:06,210
fuck.
Remarkably thoughtful and measured,

3370
02:31:06,270 --> 02:31:07,500
thoughtful.
His speech,

3371
02:31:07,560 --> 02:31:10,560
he just gave it a Howard University.
Amazing.

3372
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:12,180
It wasn't,
I didn't really listen to it.

3373
02:31:12,310 --> 02:31:16,900
Nobody,
nobody speaks with such clarity.

3374
02:31:17,860 --> 02:31:18,693
I don't understand the rage.
I really don't understand the anger and 

3375
02:31:21,871 --> 02:31:22,830
the rage.
First of all,

3376
02:31:22,831 --> 02:31:25,120
we don't rely on blunt man run this fair
nation,

3377
02:31:25,130 --> 02:31:27,480
especially when it's a Muslim was born 
in Kenya.

3378
02:31:27,930 --> 02:31:28,763
Can you understand that?
You're about to go against those people 

3379
02:31:30,961 --> 02:31:33,600
are just going to go to Africa.
Once you go look where he's born.

3380
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:36,390
You'll know once you get there,
because the spot,

3381
02:31:37,290 --> 02:31:39,720
here's a spot.
We're going to miss him.

3382
02:31:39,810 --> 02:31:42,450
I'll tell you what,
when he drifts off shore,

3383
02:31:42,480 --> 02:31:44,730
left with one of these guys,
it's going to be like,

3384
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:45,593
wow.
Remember when someone was at the helm 

3385
02:31:47,610 --> 02:31:51,210
who was just at least calm and my 
perspective,

3386
02:31:51,580 --> 02:31:52,413
that's the thing about trump that makes 
me the most nervous is just knee jerk 

3387
02:31:54,901 --> 02:31:57,990
reactions.
Just knee jerk reactions,

3388
02:31:57,991 --> 02:32:01,270
which can have real consequences that we
saw not too long ago with.

3389
02:32:02,100 --> 02:32:03,050
Yeah,
for sure.

3390
02:32:03,051 --> 02:32:04,780
The presidents.
Um,

3391
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:08,970
trump was a birther,
remember he was the birther.

3392
02:32:09,080 --> 02:32:10,470
Yeah.
Another lie.

3393
02:32:10,920 --> 02:32:14,460
Another calculated lie.
You don't tell me he believed that.

3394
02:32:14,580 --> 02:32:16,500
You don't think he believed it.
Now why was he saying it?

3395
02:32:16,501 --> 02:32:19,020
Because he was,
he was taking him down.

3396
02:32:19,021 --> 02:32:20,940
He was using it.
He caught it.

3397
02:32:20,941 --> 02:32:23,470
Caught fire.
But why was he like,

3398
02:32:23,580 --> 02:32:27,060
what was the whole point behind that for
where he is now?

3399
02:32:27,480 --> 02:32:29,490
You think?
Like he was thinking even back then when

3400
02:32:29,491 --> 02:32:30,720
he was being,
being a birther,

3401
02:32:30,790 --> 02:32:32,250
he was thinking that he was going to be 
president.

3402
02:32:32,251 --> 02:32:34,050
Yeah.
He ran before this.

3403
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:35,760
He did never caught,
yeah,

3404
02:32:35,970 --> 02:32:37,260
I don't remember that.
Did he?

3405
02:32:37,261 --> 02:32:38,910
Yeah,
he declared that he was going to,

3406
02:32:38,970 --> 02:32:41,250
that he was going to go and it never 
really caught,

3407
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:44,490
he would always come out at least a 
flirt with the idea.

3408
02:32:44,730 --> 02:32:45,510
And that's what,
uh,

3409
02:32:45,510 --> 02:32:47,190
what kind of puzzled me with this one.

3410
02:32:47,190 --> 02:32:47,731
It was like,
oh,

3411
02:32:47,731 --> 02:32:49,710
he's just doing it again.
He's getting some Pr.

3412
02:32:50,010 --> 02:32:50,843
Here's the presidential campaign.
He's attaching himself to it and then 

3413
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:57,060
this time it went further.
God,

3414
02:32:57,240 --> 02:32:58,500
Hey,
try pretty hard in 2000,

3415
02:32:58,501 --> 02:32:59,490
I think.
Yeah.

3416
02:32:59,580 --> 02:33:00,750
Wow.
That's so weird.

3417
02:33:00,751 --> 02:33:02,400
I forgot about that.
I blocked it out.

3418
02:33:02,401 --> 02:33:05,880
Implicit bias.
Say whatever you can.

3419
02:33:06,760 --> 02:33:07,593
The thing about him that really scares 
me is that he's the kind of guy that 

3420
02:33:10,861 --> 02:33:14,040
takes the bait.
He is very sensitive and takes the bait.

3421
02:33:14,430 --> 02:33:16,340
And whenever you're dealing with 
terrorism,

3422
02:33:16,360 --> 02:33:18,480
I think this is the thing that bushes I,
that,

3423
02:33:18,481 --> 02:33:19,314
uh,
Obama is doing more correctly is he's 

3424
02:33:22,771 --> 02:33:23,604
not anything that happens.
He doesn't just freak out and say we've 

3425
02:33:27,331 --> 02:33:29,790
got to act right because that's what 
they want.

3426
02:33:29,820 --> 02:33:30,653
These are small entities and they do 
things to draw this big power in and 

3427
02:33:35,641 --> 02:33:37,020
that's how they diminish your power.

3428
02:33:37,440 --> 02:33:40,230
And Obama's be cool.
This is,

3429
02:33:40,290 --> 02:33:41,190
there's another,
you know,

3430
02:33:41,191 --> 02:33:44,130
he caught shit for saying,
there's a lot of ways that we can die.

3431
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:47,220
Terrorism is only one of them and it's a
small one of them.

3432
02:33:47,610 --> 02:33:50,130
Small way,
don't take the bait,

3433
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:51,173
diminish their power by not reacting.
Trump is a guy in every aspect of life 

3434
02:33:55,920 --> 02:33:56,753
that he's reacts,
he's sensitive and freaks out and 

3435
02:33:59,491 --> 02:34:01,970
reacts.
And I don't want that kind of,

3436
02:34:01,971 --> 02:34:04,470
uh,
unsettled energy,

3437
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:09,270
that unsettled person to be in charge.
And that's going to,

3438
02:34:09,300 --> 02:34:11,730
that's going to create a frenetic way 
of,

3439
02:34:11,970 --> 02:34:12,803
of being for the country.
That's what bothers me the most about 

3440
02:34:15,601 --> 02:34:16,860
them.
That's a really good point.

3441
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:23,040
And I think also that the president,
he represents a standard of behavior.

3442
02:34:23,590 --> 02:34:25,600
Yes.
When did we lose that?

3443
02:34:25,720 --> 02:34:26,553
Yeah.

3444
02:34:27,450 --> 02:34:30,450
Say what you will about Reagan.
Bush.

3445
02:34:30,870 --> 02:34:33,990
Lbj.
They carried themselves like adults.

3446
02:34:34,130 --> 02:34:35,640
Yeah.
They carried themselves.

3447
02:34:35,641 --> 02:34:39,170
Where you they demanded your respect.
Yeah.

3448
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:40,073
Obama talks shit.
I mean I'm trump rather talk shit about 

3449
02:34:42,541 --> 02:34:45,390
people that don't support him.
Like for no reason.

3450
02:34:45,391 --> 02:34:48,360
Like one of the things that he did when 
Ronda Rousey got knocked out,

3451
02:34:49,100 --> 02:34:50,070
he uh,
said,

3452
02:34:50,071 --> 02:34:51,720
uh,
I'm happy she lost.

3453
02:34:51,780 --> 02:34:55,140
Not a good person.
Like he tweeted that,

3454
02:34:55,440 --> 02:34:57,480
that's like a teenage girl.
Yeah.

3455
02:34:57,540 --> 02:35:01,590
You want a teenage girl to be in control
of the country girl who's like 70.

3456
02:35:03,440 --> 02:35:04,530
Yeah.
Old Z.

3457
02:35:04,770 --> 02:35:05,603
How old is trump?
I'm going to put him at 65 I'm going to 

3458
02:35:08,551 --> 02:35:10,440
put them at 64

3459
02:35:15,090 --> 02:35:15,923
sorry.

3460
02:35:16,040 --> 02:35:18,890
He's up.
Erased it from the Internet is angels.

3461
02:35:18,950 --> 02:35:19,783
Well that's the other thing.
The way he talks to 46 is when he was 

3462
02:35:22,101 --> 02:35:23,540
born.
So 70 this year.

3463
02:35:23,570 --> 02:35:25,610
[inaudible] 70 this year.
So he,

3464
02:35:25,790 --> 02:35:28,730
the way he attacks,
the way he did with with her,

3465
02:35:29,270 --> 02:35:30,103
he goes after reporters.
Anyone that has any different view that 

3466
02:35:32,871 --> 02:35:34,190
worm.
Yeah.

3467
02:35:34,340 --> 02:35:36,350
Not a good person.
This is a sad,

3468
02:35:36,740 --> 02:35:38,930
that's how you're going rating sad.
Yeah.

3469
02:35:39,380 --> 02:35:40,213
So you don't think a guy like that is 
going to try and do something about the 

3470
02:35:42,921 --> 02:35:44,510
press when he's in?
Oh yeah.

3471
02:35:44,511 --> 02:35:46,070
That's going to be spooky.
Shit.

3472
02:35:46,071 --> 02:35:46,904
It's gonna be spooky because it's,
it's weird that he has the time to do 

3473
02:35:48,921 --> 02:35:49,754
these things while he's still a 
multibillionaire running all these 

3474
02:35:51,561 --> 02:35:54,770
companies.
Reality TV star running for president,

3475
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:56,353
2000 campaign chance I'll run 
millionaire considering reform party 

3476
02:35:59,361 --> 02:36:01,400
nomination.
That was the millionaire days.

3477
02:36:01,610 --> 02:36:03,080
He wasn't even a billionaire back then.

3478
02:36:03,100 --> 02:36:03,933
Yeah.
He was just a millionaire where it was 

3479
02:36:05,481 --> 02:36:08,120
worth 100 million.
I used to put out $100 million.

3480
02:36:08,240 --> 02:36:09,073
Who's going to put together a hundred 
million dollar campaign just flirting 

3481
02:36:10,971 --> 02:36:12,130
with it,
putting it out there.

3482
02:36:12,150 --> 02:36:14,030
He's been thinking about it forever.
All right.

3483
02:36:14,070 --> 02:36:14,903
Right here.
And it always seemed to me like this is 

3484
02:36:16,251 --> 02:36:18,920
a smart pr move.
Him and Jesse Ventura.

3485
02:36:18,950 --> 02:36:19,783
Yeah.
I have a class act that year in January 

3486
02:36:22,940 --> 02:36:23,773
1st about,
uh,

3487
02:36:24,020 --> 02:36:25,800
how to run the country.
It's called [inaudible].

3488
02:36:25,801 --> 02:36:27,460
It's a good title.
Uh,

3489
02:36:27,560 --> 02:36:30,500
Jesse Ventura was talking to him about 
tower seven even before nine 11.

3490
02:36:31,130 --> 02:36:31,920
Yeah.
No,

3491
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:36,920
I love the American wholesome Newton 
side job towers,

3492
02:36:38,840 --> 02:36:39,790
the America.
We change.

3493
02:36:40,370 --> 02:36:42,440
Trump releasing a book.
The America we deserve.

3494
02:36:42,680 --> 02:36:45,950
We're well,
he's right.

3495
02:36:46,220 --> 02:36:48,790
This is the America we deserve.
No Shit.

3496
02:36:49,250 --> 02:36:52,580
I just hope that what's going to happen 
is if he does get into office,

3497
02:36:52,910 --> 02:36:57,910
we'll realize that we really do need to 
be smart about how we govern ourselves.

3498
02:36:58,400 --> 02:36:59,233
We really do need to consider it.
We're really new dean to make some real 

3499
02:37:01,641 --> 02:37:04,550
steps to try to reform politics in this 
country.

3500
02:37:04,551 --> 02:37:05,384
And hopefully like someone who is really
a qualified leader or someone who's 

3501
02:37:08,871 --> 02:37:11,630
really smart and measured is looking at 
this and it's going,

3502
02:37:11,631 --> 02:37:13,100
okay,
I've got to step in.

3503
02:37:13,790 --> 02:37:18,790
You know what I at this,
he's making me really Miss Romney.

3504
02:37:19,520 --> 02:37:21,200
Mm.
Really?

3505
02:37:21,230 --> 02:37:22,063
Wow.
Yeah.

3506
02:37:22,220 --> 02:37:26,010
He's making me Miss Romney.
At least he was us,

3507
02:37:26,140 --> 02:37:30,290
uh,
measured thoughtful person.

3508
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:34,310
That's all.
I don't care when you hit what you think

3509
02:37:34,311 --> 02:37:35,144
about Obama care,
what your religion is or I don't worry 

3510
02:37:37,731 --> 02:37:38,564
about someone who thinks they're going 
to get on their own planet when they 

3511
02:37:39,861 --> 02:37:40,920
die.
Wow.

3512
02:37:40,921 --> 02:37:43,730
That maybe that part is it.
They get a planet again Joe.

3513
02:37:43,731 --> 02:37:47,090
No one's perfect.
But you know what I mean.

3514
02:37:47,091 --> 02:37:50,210
Just someone who shows up and is 
respectful to other people of course and

3515
02:37:50,211 --> 02:37:51,044
carries himself.

3516
02:37:51,050 --> 02:37:53,750
You're the day.
Yeah you're the guy,

3517
02:37:54,170 --> 02:37:55,003
you're the guy.
But what don would trump is doing is 

3518
02:37:57,981 --> 02:38:02,300
like a exciting douche bags,
cause a lot of Douche bags out there and

3519
02:38:02,301 --> 02:38:04,640
they didn't have anybody that 
represented them in government.

3520
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:07,670
And then all of a sudden he's got them 
fired up there.

3521
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:08,780
His,
he's their guy,

3522
02:38:09,090 --> 02:38:09,923
which was fine until now when other 
people who are not purportedly 

3523
02:38:16,100 --> 02:38:16,933
douchebags who are intelligent people in
the government and in the press and 

3524
02:38:22,010 --> 02:38:25,250
business leaders who are coming over and
saying,

3525
02:38:25,251 --> 02:38:27,200
okay now he's my guy.
Really?

3526
02:38:27,201 --> 02:38:28,034
So that's when it becomes dangerous.
That's when they lose sight of it and 

3527
02:38:31,251 --> 02:38:32,960
start rationalizing it and say,
well,

3528
02:38:32,961 --> 02:38:35,180
he's not hilary,
so I'm going to go with this guy.

3529
02:38:35,240 --> 02:38:36,073
Did you ever see the video address of 
Ted Cruz who is even more dangerous by 

3530
02:38:38,991 --> 02:38:40,040
the way?
Ted Cruz,

3531
02:38:40,041 --> 02:38:40,874
the most dangerous.
He scares the fuck out of me cause he's 

3532
02:38:43,011 --> 02:38:43,844
so dumb.

3533
02:38:44,030 --> 02:38:49,030
He saw what he represents is just 
fucking flatline thinking and he is.

3534
02:38:49,821 --> 02:38:50,654
I'm standing at this rally and there's a
trump supporter in front of them with 

3535
02:38:53,301 --> 02:38:55,970
sunglasses on,
like feet away from him.

3536
02:38:55,971 --> 02:38:58,250
Tell him quit drop out.
I saw that.

3537
02:38:58,430 --> 02:39:00,200
Yeah.
And it's just like that.

3538
02:39:00,201 --> 02:39:04,850
Is that that kind of a support or like 
that's a new kind of supporter.

3539
02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:05,713
The bully,
the really aggressive man who shows up 

3540
02:39:08,331 --> 02:39:11,570
with a sign stands in front of you with 
sunglasses on.

3541
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:13,880
Yeah.
Let's go tells you yet it's time to drop

3542
02:39:13,881 --> 02:39:15,320
out Tom Dropout.
Yeah.

3543
02:39:15,510 --> 02:39:17,000
And he goes,
what do you like about trump,

3544
02:39:17,001 --> 02:39:18,020
sir?
Everything.

3545
02:39:18,800 --> 02:39:19,633
Everything.
Like he probably doesn't even know 

3546
02:39:20,541 --> 02:39:23,000
anything.
Nothing that trump is supporting.

3547
02:39:23,001 --> 02:39:24,410
Nothing.
It's weird.

3548
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:26,090
Nothing.
It's just bravado.

3549
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:27,260
Well,
it's just weird.

3550
02:39:27,261 --> 02:39:28,910
I mean,
we have this culture that we're,

3551
02:39:28,911 --> 02:39:33,260
we're,
we're consuming nonsense all the time.

3552
02:39:33,480 --> 02:39:34,313
We're consuming nonsense in the form of 
transformers and sitcoms and TV shows 

3553
02:39:39,081 --> 02:39:40,020
and just,
we're,

3554
02:39:40,030 --> 02:39:43,220
we're constantly eating nonsense with 
very little substance.

3555
02:39:43,610 --> 02:39:48,050
And then this guy comes along who 
represents for the first time,

3556
02:39:48,051 --> 02:39:50,880
like a guy who's like,
why did I make America great again?

3557
02:39:50,881 --> 02:39:51,714
And you know,
throw your fists up in the air and that 

3558
02:39:52,881 --> 02:39:54,260
kind of rhetoric and the,
these,

3559
02:39:54,350 --> 02:39:58,310
these guys just hop onto it and he's a 
familiar face from the nonsense.

3560
02:39:58,311 --> 02:39:59,480
Exactly.
Yeah.

3561
02:39:59,870 --> 02:40:02,240
Reality TV's guy that you've listened to
before.

3562
02:40:02,570 --> 02:40:04,040
So strange.
Yeah.

3563
02:40:04,380 --> 02:40:05,990
Scary.
It's a really,

3564
02:40:05,991 --> 02:40:06,824
it's a,
it's a real telling thing of where we 

3565
02:40:08,001 --> 02:40:08,834
are with the media,
but how much power does the president 

3566
02:40:11,571 --> 02:40:12,404
actually have?
A little will highlight it once he gets 

3567
02:40:14,461 --> 02:40:15,570
into office,
like the,

3568
02:40:15,571 --> 02:40:16,980
what would congress and

3569
02:40:17,330 --> 02:40:20,030
yeah,
because look,

3570
02:40:20,300 --> 02:40:21,133
Iraq,
which is arguably one of the greatest 

3571
02:40:23,211 --> 02:40:24,044
mistakes in centuries of just all the 
evidence of what's happening over there 

3572
02:40:28,851 --> 02:40:30,920
to those poor people.
Uh,

3573
02:40:31,700 --> 02:40:33,980
that happens because that guy is in 
charge.

3574
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:35,593
So yeah,
there are real global consequences to 

3575
02:40:39,560 --> 02:40:40,460
who's ever in that office.

3576
02:40:40,550 --> 02:40:41,383
And he's bringing in like real political
masterminds to try to organize his 

3577
02:40:44,901 --> 02:40:46,470
campaign from here on out.
Yeah.

3578
02:40:46,490 --> 02:40:49,160
So I feel like he got to the dance.
He's essentially,

3579
02:40:49,161 --> 02:40:50,990
they haven't made him the Republican 
nominee,

3580
02:40:50,991 --> 02:40:52,340
but there's no one else.
Nope.

3581
02:40:52,520 --> 02:40:54,380
No one's stepping up.
How would that happen?

3582
02:40:54,381 --> 02:40:56,930
Like is there a,
is there a possibility that he could not

3583
02:40:56,931 --> 02:40:58,430
be the nominee?
Is there any way?

3584
02:40:58,460 --> 02:41:00,170
Not any longer.
No.

3585
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:01,580
No.
Wow.

3586
02:41:02,020 --> 02:41:05,590
The only car,
the only curve ball could be that.

3587
02:41:05,591 --> 02:41:06,490
Um,
and this is,

3588
02:41:06,550 --> 02:41:07,630
well,
there's a couple of curve balls.

3589
02:41:07,690 --> 02:41:09,010
There's many curve balls.
But,

3590
02:41:09,130 --> 02:41:09,963
uh,
a third party candidate could arise and 

3591
02:41:12,851 --> 02:41:13,684
say that they're going to go for,
it was another scary curve ball is that 

3592
02:41:17,561 --> 02:41:21,940
it stays the way that it is.
And Hillary gets past Bernie and it's,

3593
02:41:22,360 --> 02:41:24,820
it's Hillary and trump and they start 
going to battle.

3594
02:41:25,450 --> 02:41:27,340
And then this,
uh,

3595
02:41:27,610 --> 02:41:28,443
the Bengazi reports and everything that 
she's being investigated for their 

3596
02:41:33,011 --> 02:41:35,470
sailing in the New York Times today that
they're holding,

3597
02:41:35,710 --> 02:41:36,543
they're slowing down that process so 
that she shit comes out about her like 

3598
02:41:40,631 --> 02:41:42,580
on the eve of the election.
Really?

3599
02:41:42,620 --> 02:41:43,453
Yeah.

3600
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:45,073
You like that stuff?
The Republican House who's 

3601
02:41:48,111 --> 02:41:48,944
investigating?
So they're virtually guaranteeing that 

3602
02:41:52,101 --> 02:41:52,920
she,
they,

3603
02:41:52,920 --> 02:41:55,110
it's almost like they have a bomb,
right?

3604
02:41:55,250 --> 02:41:56,660
They're going to drop it at the proper 
time.

3605
02:41:56,690 --> 02:41:59,060
It's their one shot,
not just Ben Gazi.

3606
02:41:59,061 --> 02:41:59,894
It's also the email server,
the email and cloud sending classified 

3607
02:42:02,931 --> 02:42:04,550
emails.
I had Mike Baker on,

3608
02:42:04,551 --> 02:42:08,030
he's a former CIA operative and he's 
pretty blake blunt about it.

3609
02:42:08,270 --> 02:42:08,990
He said,
look,

3610
02:42:08,990 --> 02:42:11,150
if I did what she did,
I'd be in jail.

3611
02:42:11,220 --> 02:42:12,050
Right.
And he's like,

3612
02:42:12,050 --> 02:42:15,050
we have top secret,
secret clearances,

3613
02:42:15,051 --> 02:42:17,150
all those different levels for a reason.
Yeah.

3614
02:42:17,151 --> 02:42:17,984
You're responsible.
Take information from those emails that 

3615
02:42:20,751 --> 02:42:21,584
are top secret and then just cut and 
paste and put them in emails that are 

3616
02:42:24,321 --> 02:42:26,210
going through a regular server.
You can't do it.

3617
02:42:26,270 --> 02:42:27,103
Right.
And the fact that this guy in Romania 

3618
02:42:28,971 --> 02:42:29,804
who some hacker character,
he's like reading all her emails like 

3619
02:42:32,841 --> 02:42:33,890
wow.
Crazy.

3620
02:42:34,700 --> 02:42:36,590
Very scary.
So the,

3621
02:42:36,680 --> 02:42:39,860
so back to your original question.
Yeah,

3622
02:42:40,100 --> 02:42:41,240
he could be your president.

3623
02:42:41,350 --> 02:42:42,820
I think he might be.
What's going on.

3624
02:42:43,360 --> 02:42:45,070
Did you see this got announced 
yesterday?

3625
02:42:45,700 --> 02:42:49,120
What does it take the power back power 
back to all over La.

3626
02:42:49,121 --> 02:42:51,190
Yesterday there was a,
these,

3627
02:42:51,480 --> 02:42:53,770
I don't know,
posters were posted all around with this

3628
02:42:53,771 --> 02:42:54,604
Hashtag and profits of rage.com
was the website to go to and there's 

3629
02:42:57,941 --> 02:43:02,050
just a countdown on this website that 
goes to June 1st which I'm not 100% sure

3630
02:43:02,051 --> 02:43:05,190
of is that if that's the date of the RNC
in Cleveland I think.

3631
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:06,910
I think it's pretty close to it.
Either way.

3632
02:43:07,240 --> 02:43:08,073
What has been announced I think has been
coming out of the last 24 hours is that 

3633
02:43:10,301 --> 02:43:11,680
members of rage,
the machine,

3634
02:43:11,681 --> 02:43:12,010
public

3635
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:12,843
enemy and Cypress Hill are getting back 
together and they're going to start 

3636
02:43:15,521 --> 02:43:16,354
doing some political concerts.
It seems like and concert with the RNC 

3637
02:43:20,590 --> 02:43:21,970
against the RNC.
I mean,

3638
02:43:21,971 --> 02:43:23,920
that's what Reggie gets machine was 
doing a long time ago.

3639
02:43:24,580 --> 02:43:26,750
Here's the thing,
if it's not the Republicans,

3640
02:43:26,780 --> 02:43:30,190
then it's the Democrats.
And is Hillary Clinton much better?

3641
02:43:30,550 --> 02:43:32,290
Yes.
Is she much better than him?

3642
02:43:32,360 --> 02:43:34,640
Yes.
Just because of stability.

3643
02:43:34,670 --> 02:43:36,020
I mean,
she's not perfect.

3644
02:43:36,380 --> 02:43:39,810
I'm not a democrat or a Republican,
but there,

3645
02:43:40,100 --> 02:43:45,100
that man is an irrational television 
star.

3646
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:49,190
He's a bad guy.
You don't want that.

3647
02:43:49,400 --> 02:43:51,560
You don't want that.
She's not perfect.

3648
02:43:51,830 --> 02:43:55,130
But there's stability and is,
I just want calm uptime.

3649
02:43:55,390 --> 02:43:57,440
Gimme calm.
Give me people who have been there.

3650
02:43:57,530 --> 02:43:58,363
He's bringing in these like real estate 
thugs from Atlantic city to be his 

3651
02:44:01,191 --> 02:44:02,024
advisor.
He's a nut bag who goes on twitter like 

3652
02:44:04,281 --> 02:44:07,040
a 12 year old girl and starts getting in
fights with people.

3653
02:44:07,100 --> 02:44:09,710
Not the president of the United States.
Entertaining.

3654
02:44:09,711 --> 02:44:11,240
Sure.
But come on.

3655
02:44:11,780 --> 02:44:16,780
Well now that he's sort of achieved the 
helm of the Republican Party,

3656
02:44:17,150 --> 02:44:20,000
um,
did you see that Megan Kelly thing now,

3657
02:44:20,090 --> 02:44:22,520
Megan Kelly,
they did an interview recently of a kiss

3658
02:44:22,521 --> 02:44:24,500
and makeup.
She kissed his ass.

3659
02:44:24,501 --> 02:44:25,251
Really?
Yeah.

3660
02:44:25,251 --> 02:44:26,084
That's by all means by all accounts.
She kissed his ass and they made it 

3661
02:44:29,781 --> 02:44:31,480
about the two of them.
Right.

3662
02:44:31,540 --> 02:44:33,830
Made it about there.
The little relationship together,

3663
02:44:33,831 --> 02:44:35,150
their,
their interactions together.

3664
02:44:35,151 --> 02:44:37,460
But he's been shitting on our culinary a
hack forever.

3665
02:44:37,461 --> 02:44:39,430
Look at this.
It's what he does believe for who?

3666
02:44:39,431 --> 02:44:41,630
Megan Kelly interview of Donald Trump 
made it clear.

3667
02:44:41,631 --> 02:44:44,140
Once again,
the definition of bullying has extended,

3668
02:44:44,180 --> 02:44:47,000
expanded almost to the point of 
meaninglessness.

3669
02:44:47,060 --> 02:44:47,893
Yeah.
It kind of has like whenever someone 

3670
02:44:49,581 --> 02:44:51,410
like gets upset at someone,
they're a bully.

3671
02:44:51,630 --> 02:44:53,120
Now it's a bully,
right?

3672
02:44:53,900 --> 02:44:55,430
Yeah.
If you have power,

3673
02:44:55,850 --> 02:44:58,340
you're a bully.
He's the most scary to me.

3674
02:44:58,341 --> 02:44:59,210
When he gets calm.

3675
02:44:59,210 --> 02:45:02,580
Like that just starts talking like 
pretending to be a grownup.

3676
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:04,940
Hold on.
The liquid is saying here,

3677
02:45:04,990 --> 02:45:06,380
all my exclusive.
Look at this.

3678
02:45:06,740 --> 02:45:09,860
They didn't use the occasion.
Talk about politics or policy.

3679
02:45:09,861 --> 02:45:10,694
Instead,
they talked almost exclusively in the 

3680
02:45:11,961 --> 02:45:14,480
[inaudible] version of the conversation 
about bullying.

3681
02:45:14,840 --> 02:45:18,710
What most kids between the age of six 
and 16 had been bullied at some point in

3682
02:45:18,711 --> 02:45:19,830
their life,
uh,

3683
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:22,160
lives.
Kelly's told trump she paused.

3684
02:45:22,280 --> 02:45:23,660
Were you ever bullied?
No,

3685
02:45:23,661 --> 02:45:27,800
I wasn't trump reply.
But I have seen bullying and bullying.

3686
02:45:27,801 --> 02:45:30,500
Doesn't have to be as a child,
just have to be as a child.

3687
02:45:30,740 --> 02:45:31,573
I mean,
I know people were bullied when they're 

3688
02:45:32,241 --> 02:45:36,200
55 it can have when you're 45 Kelly 
replied,

3689
02:45:36,230 --> 02:45:37,460
Oh hey,
what about 44

3690
02:45:37,500 --> 02:45:40,950
what about talking about opioids?
Killing Americans.

3691
02:45:40,951 --> 02:45:42,570
How about talking about about 
cigarettes.

3692
02:45:42,630 --> 02:45:44,970
How about talking about how you're going
to take millions,

3693
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:49,100
11 million people and try and push them 
down to Mexico on Day One?

3694
02:45:49,180 --> 02:45:50,560
Well,
she was insinuating,

3695
02:45:50,561 --> 02:45:55,420
I guess that she had 45 was being 
bullied by trump because of tweets.

3696
02:45:55,720 --> 02:46:00,550
But when someone,
he said he continued simply it happens,

3697
02:46:00,551 --> 02:46:02,200
we've got to get over it,
fight back,

3698
02:46:02,201 --> 02:46:03,034
do whatever you have to do.
But it when someone criticizes you and 

3699
02:46:05,801 --> 02:46:06,634
then you criticize them and they are a 
national newscaster and near a national 

3700
02:46:11,901 --> 02:46:13,580
figure too.
What's bullying?

3701
02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:14,660
Like?
Where is it?

3702
02:46:14,660 --> 02:46:17,620
Where's that bullying?
Whereas that someone who is insulting,

3703
02:46:17,740 --> 02:46:18,573
it's insulting someone.
Bullying is shitting on someone 

3704
02:46:20,511 --> 02:46:21,344
bullying.
Like when does it like that word 

3705
02:46:22,701 --> 02:46:27,701
bullying to me is like a bigger person 
picking on a smaller person with a small

3706
02:46:27,981 --> 02:46:29,220
person can't do anything.
Right.

3707
02:46:29,420 --> 02:46:30,253
Well,
she clearly has a voice of her own 

3708
02:46:32,090 --> 02:46:35,300
right,
and she clearly is a person of power and

3709
02:46:35,330 --> 02:46:37,100
influence and she's on television.

3710
02:46:37,130 --> 02:46:38,120
Yeah,
I'm confused.

3711
02:46:38,121 --> 02:46:39,920
Even who's bullying who in that 
scenario,

3712
02:46:39,921 --> 02:46:41,810
because she is powerful because she has 
a,

3713
02:46:41,870 --> 02:46:46,810
she has the media.
He's powerful because he had the mic.

3714
02:46:46,840 --> 02:46:47,240
Yeah,

3715
02:46:47,240 --> 02:46:49,430
well she's way more classy about it for 
sure.

3716
02:46:49,730 --> 02:46:50,563
And her criticisms are fairly valid and 
it's all things that she believes need 

3717
02:46:54,051 --> 02:46:57,050
to be addressed.
So I don't think she's bullying him,

3718
02:46:57,440 --> 02:46:59,840
but as he bullying her by insulting her.
How's that?

3719
02:47:00,050 --> 02:47:02,780
Is that bullying or is it just insult.
Okay.

3720
02:47:02,790 --> 02:47:03,623
Leah,
this saying,

3721
02:47:04,100 --> 02:47:07,220
let me ask you about that.
Because most American parents are trying

3722
02:47:07,221 --> 02:47:09,650
to raise their kids to not believe,
to name,

3723
02:47:09,651 --> 02:47:10,580
call,
not tease,

3724
02:47:10,581 --> 02:47:11,414
not taunt.
How can they effectively bring that 

3725
02:47:13,641 --> 02:47:15,200
message to the front runner?
Oh,

3726
02:47:15,201 --> 02:47:18,380
when the front runner for the Republican
nomination does all of those things,

3727
02:47:18,920 --> 02:47:19,641
he says,
well,

3728
02:47:19,641 --> 02:47:20,990
I do it really,
you know,

3729
02:47:21,320 --> 02:47:24,740
I've been saying during this whole 
campaign that I'm a counterpuncher.

3730
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:29,760
You understand that I'm responding now.
I then respond times may be 10 what?

3731
02:47:31,100 --> 02:47:32,180
Okay.
I don't know.

3732
02:47:32,450 --> 02:47:35,360
I respond pretty strongly,
but in just about all cases,

3733
02:47:35,361 --> 02:47:37,670
I've been responding to what they did to
me.

3734
02:47:37,850 --> 02:47:39,260
So it's not a one way street.

3735
02:47:39,350 --> 02:47:40,610
Okay.
Uh Huh.

3736
02:47:41,810 --> 02:47:44,870
I don't know if this is brilliance.
You're talking about all of this instead

3737
02:47:44,871 --> 02:47:46,220
of yeah.
Right.

3738
02:47:47,140 --> 02:47:48,840
So crazy that,
yeah.

3739
02:47:49,100 --> 02:47:54,100
So she's essentially painting herself as
a victim and wanting to talk to this guy

3740
02:47:55,100 --> 02:47:55,933
who bullied her and wanting him to 
address the idea and concept of 

3741
02:47:58,821 --> 02:47:59,654
bullying.
Yeah.

3742
02:47:59,990 --> 02:48:01,340
And uh,
he's like,

3743
02:48:01,341 --> 02:48:02,250
Hey,
I'm a counter puncher.

3744
02:48:02,270 --> 02:48:03,350
Fuck with me.
I fuck you back.

3745
02:48:04,070 --> 02:48:04,581
Well,
his,

3746
02:48:04,581 --> 02:48:07,190
his thing is you do,
you do come out and bully.

3747
02:48:07,400 --> 02:48:09,350
He beats the shit out of boom.
And then it was like,

3748
02:48:09,680 --> 02:48:11,120
Hey,
Ted Cruz is a nice guy.

3749
02:48:12,830 --> 02:48:13,663
Oh good.
He's been acting nice to me for a 

3750
02:48:14,601 --> 02:48:16,070
second.
He's going to be his running mate.

3751
02:48:16,780 --> 02:48:19,190
I don't know how about that.
Fat Guy from New Jersey,

3752
02:48:19,220 --> 02:48:20,510
he might go with,
uh,

3753
02:48:20,970 --> 02:48:22,790
um,
the fat guy from New Jersey.

3754
02:48:22,820 --> 02:48:24,530
They,
they've been together a lot.

3755
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:25,393
He told the fat guy from New Jersey that
he's going to be the guy in charge of 

3756
02:48:28,341 --> 02:48:31,730
his transition team to the White House.
Did you see the fat guy in New Jersey,

3757
02:48:31,731 --> 02:48:32,421
porn,
m,

3758
02:48:32,421 --> 02:48:34,280
and m's into his bag of M and.
M's?

3759
02:48:34,710 --> 02:48:36,200
I had two bags of M and.
M's.

3760
02:48:36,201 --> 02:48:38,720
He had a large bag of m and m's in a 
small bag of M and.

3761
02:48:38,721 --> 02:48:39,554
M's and he poured the large,
the small bag into the large bag that 

3762
02:48:43,911 --> 02:48:45,780
fucking tried to,
Oh,

3763
02:48:45,781 --> 02:48:47,100
a bit of credit for that.
Like this,

3764
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:51,240
the way it's packaged and it's just a 
box of m and ms with a small one inside,

3765
02:48:52,170 --> 02:48:54,620
whatever that might get.
The rose is a monster.

3766
02:48:54,650 --> 02:48:59,030
I think m and m meeting monster,
I would think he probably goes with,

3767
02:48:59,031 --> 02:49:01,670
um,
was the governor of Arizona.

3768
02:49:02,090 --> 02:49:05,450
The woman who was yelling at Jan brewer.
No fucking way.

3769
02:49:05,630 --> 02:49:07,530
I don't think so.
She's way too dumb.

3770
02:49:07,740 --> 02:49:08,040
She's

3771
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:09,000
scary.
Scary,

3772
02:49:09,001 --> 02:49:09,691
scary.
Dom.

3773
02:49:09,691 --> 02:49:14,280
Have you ever seen her interrogated or,
or an interview if someone questions are

3774
02:49:14,281 --> 02:49:15,990
and gives her a hard time.
I just see her yelling.

3775
02:49:16,800 --> 02:49:19,650
She just represents scared old people 
live in Arizona.

3776
02:49:19,980 --> 02:49:21,480
You know,
that's how they scooped her up.

3777
02:49:21,481 --> 02:49:26,100
Scare old people is you know,
good group to go for right now.

3778
02:49:26,130 --> 02:49:27,450
Tom Papa,
you worried about the world.

3779
02:49:27,720 --> 02:49:29,720
You're a bright guy,
a thoughtful guy.

3780
02:49:29,870 --> 02:49:31,860
I'm pretty optimistic about the world 
actually.

3781
02:49:31,861 --> 02:49:33,540
What's going to happen,
uh,

3782
02:49:33,870 --> 02:49:34,703
to the world and with this whole 
election thing with his election to 

3783
02:49:37,021 --> 02:49:37,854
learn from this.
I don't know if we're going to learn 

3784
02:49:39,361 --> 02:49:41,930
from this.
I don't think we learned from uh,

3785
02:49:42,250 --> 02:49:45,300
the Bush era.
I don't think we've learned that much.

3786
02:49:45,330 --> 02:49:46,820
I think we're going through a little bit
of a,

3787
02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:50,760
a dark time where you know,
people that make a lot of noise,

3788
02:49:50,761 --> 02:49:54,770
you have someone thoughtful like Obama 
who wants to just have people discussing

3789
02:49:54,780 --> 02:49:55,613
if people embraced and we're able to 
debate with him rather than just block 

3790
02:49:58,561 --> 02:49:59,070
him.

3791
02:49:59,070 --> 02:49:59,903
He wouldn't have won all of his things,
but the other side would have been more 

3792
02:50:01,621 --> 02:50:04,920
thoughtful as well and we would have,
wouldn't be in the place we are now.

3793
02:50:05,250 --> 02:50:06,083
I think we're in this new media,
this new way of digesting information 

3794
02:50:08,761 --> 02:50:12,210
that's very confusing to people.
And some bad people are taking advantage

3795
02:50:12,211 --> 02:50:13,044
of it,
but I think ultimately we're going to 

3796
02:50:15,601 --> 02:50:19,710
sift through and uh,
and good people and good ideas will come

3797
02:50:19,711 --> 02:50:21,300
to the,
to the forefront.

3798
02:50:21,390 --> 02:50:22,223
I don't know how,
but I'm pretty optimistic that that's 

3799
02:50:24,001 --> 02:50:24,834
the way it goes.
Heavy evil ways tend to die off and go 

3800
02:50:28,951 --> 02:50:30,560
away.
So I'm,

3801
02:50:30,630 --> 02:50:33,660
I'm pretty optimistic.
A powerful message from Tom.

3802
02:50:33,661 --> 02:50:36,350
Bob,
I hope you write more piano.

3803
02:50:36,560 --> 02:50:38,850
I think people are nicer now than 
they've ever been before.

3804
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:39,713
I really do.
And I think one of the things about it 

3805
02:50:40,470 --> 02:50:43,110
is billy discussion,
this discussion is a,

3806
02:50:43,111 --> 02:50:43,944
is an important discussion.
Bullying is a real problem and it 

3807
02:50:46,291 --> 02:50:47,124
wouldn't,
that discussion wouldn't be taken place 

3808
02:50:48,930 --> 02:50:50,340
10 years ago,
20 years ago.

3809
02:50:50,370 --> 02:50:52,530
Nobody give a fuck about bullying.
Like suck it up,

3810
02:50:52,531 --> 02:50:53,760
bitch.
We all got bullied.

3811
02:50:54,300 --> 02:50:55,110
No,
you're right.

3812
02:50:55,110 --> 02:50:57,320
I mean pretty quickly that's happened,
right?

3813
02:50:57,330 --> 02:50:58,950
I just can't believe he said he never 
got bullied.

3814
02:50:59,160 --> 02:51:01,920
How'd you never got bullied?
If you're the bully I guess.

3815
02:51:01,921 --> 02:51:03,870
But he's always been the bullies.
Whole light show.

3816
02:51:04,500 --> 02:51:05,333
He needs someone to bully him.
I bet if someone came out and bullied 

3817
02:51:07,111 --> 02:51:08,580
him,
like one of them Koch brothers,

3818
02:51:09,090 --> 02:51:09,923
that'd be funny.

3819
02:51:10,210 --> 02:51:13,940
Like I used to bully him fucking pussy.
You Suck my Dick.

3820
02:51:13,941 --> 02:51:17,540
When he owed me a million,
we survive up balls on his face in sixth

3821
02:51:17,541 --> 02:51:18,860
grade.
He would cry.

3822
02:51:18,861 --> 02:51:19,694
It was hilarious.
We fuck his hair out and then he starts 

3823
02:51:24,801 --> 02:51:28,590
tweeting back.
Sad exclamation point,

3824
02:51:28,950 --> 02:51:31,340
smelling balls,
hit balls.

3825
02:51:31,341 --> 02:51:32,630
Always smelled sad.

3826
02:51:34,920 --> 02:51:35,753
No,
but I'm pretty optimistic and you know 

3827
02:51:36,811 --> 02:51:37,170
what,
it's,

3828
02:51:37,170 --> 02:51:38,610
you know,
it's interesting and I think,

3829
02:51:38,730 --> 02:51:40,680
I don't know,
I'm talking out of my ass,

3830
02:51:40,681 --> 02:51:41,700
but I,
we all are.

3831
02:51:41,850 --> 02:51:43,870
But I do feel like,
uh,

3832
02:51:44,550 --> 02:51:46,890
when you travel around and you do your 
shows and stuff,

3833
02:51:47,750 --> 02:51:51,000
there's the thing that's lost and all of
this discussion is there's,

3834
02:51:51,270 --> 02:51:52,103
there's Americans,
there's just plain old Americans who 

3835
02:51:54,451 --> 02:51:55,284
don't say,
I'm purely Republican and purely 

3836
02:51:57,450 --> 02:51:58,283
Democrat.
I'm just screw the other side at all 

3837
02:52:00,151 --> 02:52:00,984
costs.
There are just working people that are 

3838
02:52:02,701 --> 02:52:04,620
just,
just Americans.

3839
02:52:04,680 --> 02:52:08,980
Like what happened to America being the 
thing that we're all working towards and

3840
02:52:09,250 --> 02:52:10,083
suss these people out for what's going 
to be better for our kids and for the 

3841
02:52:12,341 --> 02:52:13,174
country.
I feel like the Internet is going to 

3842
02:52:16,090 --> 02:52:16,923
sift through this bullshit.
I mean what we're seeing really with 

3843
02:52:18,731 --> 02:52:23,731
trump in a way is kind of this implosion
of that party because they let the crazy

3844
02:52:24,190 --> 02:52:28,780
tea party right wing part of it devour 
it and now they're in chaos.

3845
02:52:29,290 --> 02:52:34,150
Maybe that's a sign that people that are
extreme won't survive.

3846
02:52:34,151 --> 02:52:37,240
They'll kind of devour and devolve into 
something else.

3847
02:52:37,270 --> 02:52:38,140
Well,
not only that,

3848
02:52:38,170 --> 02:52:39,003
there were people were ganging up to try
to stop trump in the party like Marco 

3849
02:52:44,890 --> 02:52:45,723
Rubio and Ted Cruz.
They had like this pack they were going 

3850
02:52:47,081 --> 02:52:51,700
to like try to figure out a way to stop 
trump from moving forward.

3851
02:52:51,720 --> 02:52:52,810
Right.
And trump,

3852
02:52:53,080 --> 02:52:55,150
in my eyes,
at least if I'm looking at it,

3853
02:52:55,180 --> 02:52:57,730
I think he's looking at this as like an 
accomplishment.

3854
02:52:57,910 --> 02:53:00,370
This is Mount Everest to climb to become
the president.

3855
02:53:00,760 --> 02:53:01,593
Whereas I don't think he's looking at in
terms of really serving the United 

3856
02:53:05,800 --> 02:53:07,390
States people.
I don't think he's that guy.

3857
02:53:07,450 --> 02:53:08,930
No,
I don't think that's,

3858
02:53:09,280 --> 02:53:11,650
I mean that's not why he's so 
successful.

3859
02:53:11,800 --> 02:53:14,980
He's so successful because he,
he represents his own shit.

3860
02:53:15,250 --> 02:53:17,350
He knows how to do it.
He gets it done.

3861
02:53:17,380 --> 02:53:18,213
He's easy,
egocentric comic who doesn't have much 

3862
02:53:20,301 --> 02:53:24,200
of an act but becomes really successful 
cause he believes in him so much.

3863
02:53:24,290 --> 02:53:26,560
I know who you're talking about.
I'm talking about that guys,

3864
02:53:26,570 --> 02:53:28,760
a couple of them.
But no,

3865
02:53:28,761 --> 02:53:29,594
it's,
that'd be listening right now when 

3866
02:53:30,411 --> 02:53:32,420
there's that narcissistic thing,
right.

3867
02:53:32,450 --> 02:53:37,450
You do become successful because you 
want it more than anyone wants you to go

3868
02:53:37,821 --> 02:53:38,440
away.

3869
02:53:38,440 --> 02:53:39,280
Yeah.
We certainly,

3870
02:53:39,400 --> 02:53:41,230
it can be done.
I mean,

3871
02:53:41,231 --> 02:53:44,090
he's showing that he can get so close.
Yeah.

3872
02:53:44,290 --> 02:53:46,390
But I don't still know if Hillary can 
beat him.

3873
02:53:47,200 --> 02:53:48,033
And Bernie's,

3874
02:53:48,110 --> 02:53:50,270
I know that's kind of the thing.
Do you like Bernie?

3875
02:53:51,200 --> 02:53:52,033
I like him as a character.
I followed him on twitter just because 

3876
02:53:54,201 --> 02:53:56,900
he was an independent when he was an 
independent.

3877
02:53:57,800 --> 02:53:59,900
He was just like this little rebel from 
Vermont.

3878
02:53:59,901 --> 02:54:00,734
And he just seemed like a cool,
I've always loved Vermont and it seemed 

3879
02:54:02,691 --> 02:54:03,524
like this free thinking area.
I liked him more of just following him 

3880
02:54:06,651 --> 02:54:08,890
that way.
His ideas of,

3881
02:54:09,080 --> 02:54:12,500
you know,
of socialism and uh,

3882
02:54:12,501 --> 02:54:14,570
and I don't say that as a,
as a real,

3883
02:54:14,930 --> 02:54:17,630
you know,
democratic socialist is not a scary,

3884
02:54:17,631 --> 02:54:19,940
like mindless thing.
But,

3885
02:54:19,941 --> 02:54:20,774
uh,
I don't see him being that good of a 

3886
02:54:24,231 --> 02:54:26,240
leader.
I don't see him being,

3887
02:54:26,570 --> 02:54:28,640
he's,
he is pretty extreme.

3888
02:54:28,910 --> 02:54:30,920
He is pretty extreme and it,
I it,

3889
02:54:31,430 --> 02:54:32,263
I don't see him as a PR.
I loved him as like a senator from 

3890
02:54:33,831 --> 02:54:34,664
Vermont.
I like the idea of trying someone to 

3891
02:54:36,951 --> 02:54:37,784
extreme,
just who we can see what's wrong with 

3892
02:54:38,601 --> 02:54:40,430
it.
Well that's the trump thing.

3893
02:54:40,700 --> 02:54:43,910
That is the trump thing.
I voted for parole at one point.

3894
02:54:43,940 --> 02:54:44,450
Oh,
did you?

3895
02:54:44,450 --> 02:54:45,680
Yeah,
I did too.

3896
02:54:45,710 --> 02:54:48,050
I just wanted this,
this guy who was making some sense,

3897
02:54:48,051 --> 02:54:49,190
he's not perfect,
but fuck,

3898
02:54:49,191 --> 02:54:50,210
let's,
let's,

3899
02:54:50,990 --> 02:54:54,020
let's throw the card table up in the air
and see where we're at.

3900
02:54:54,550 --> 02:54:56,300
There's a new game at the end of the 
day.

3901
02:54:56,330 --> 02:54:57,163
Do you remember when Perot had that ad 
on television or he took out an entire 

3902
02:55:00,560 --> 02:55:02,380
half hour of television and bought it?
Yes.

3903
02:55:02,540 --> 02:55:05,000
And then explain why the irs is fucking 
you.

3904
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:06,350
Yeah.
Ooh,

3905
02:55:06,410 --> 02:55:09,080
I know.
I remember like my jaw dropping.

3906
02:55:09,090 --> 02:55:10,680
I don't watch that going.
Why?

3907
02:55:11,510 --> 02:55:12,343
I know it wasn't,
wasn't totally off base and that's why 

3908
02:55:15,650 --> 02:55:16,483
honestly that's why I get why people 
want trump without even knowing that 

3909
02:55:20,661 --> 02:55:23,360
much opposition of the issues.
It's like,

3910
02:55:23,361 --> 02:55:24,410
let's,
let's rock this.

3911
02:55:24,510 --> 02:55:25,343
Let's,
let's,

3912
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:28,400
let's blow this thing up.
Just it was not serving me.

3913
02:55:29,420 --> 02:55:31,790
When you want a loss in their boys hair,
nails,

3914
02:55:31,820 --> 02:55:33,730
ladies and gentlemen,
what does he say?

3915
02:55:33,790 --> 02:55:34,790
Good.
Crank it up there.

3916
02:55:34,990 --> 02:55:39,050
Maybe now's the time for me to waive the
voters deck and get rid of the heck,

3917
02:55:39,290 --> 02:55:40,123
but it'll take a lot more than that.
It would take millions of years showing 

3918
02:55:42,421 --> 02:55:44,850
up on November the third to get rid of 
this hex.

3919
02:55:45,570 --> 02:55:48,000
He'd been mind.
The value of the dollar is going down.

3920
02:55:48,030 --> 02:55:50,340
The number of people making less than 
$12,000

3921
02:55:50,341 --> 02:55:51,174
is going up.
I don't want to bore you with this 

3922
02:55:53,741 --> 02:55:57,840
statement that trickled down,
didn't trickle work.

3923
02:55:58,590 --> 02:56:03,420
We have 19th century century capitalism 
and this kind of cree are successful.

3924
02:56:03,421 --> 02:56:07,170
International competitors are practicing
modern day capitalism.

3925
02:56:07,380 --> 02:56:10,620
We need to practice 21st century 
capitalism.

3926
02:56:11,160 --> 02:56:11,993
We need an intelligent,
supportive relationship between 

3927
02:56:14,161 --> 02:56:17,430
government and business.
We need longterm thinking.

3928
02:56:17,640 --> 02:56:18,473
We need to target the industries of the 
future and make sure they are here and 

3929
02:56:23,071 --> 02:56:25,110
the words made in the USA or written 
across them.

3930
02:56:25,650 --> 02:56:26,483
We need to have the most rapidly growing
small business society in the world 

3931
02:56:30,210 --> 02:56:32,430
because we can create more jobs more 
quickly.

3932
02:56:32,431 --> 02:56:34,380
They're all of this can be done.

3933
02:56:36,240 --> 02:56:38,250
Kidnap his daughter.
They did.

3934
02:56:38,550 --> 02:56:41,580
They threatened to who did some fucking 
bad people.

3935
02:56:41,930 --> 02:56:43,140
Yeah,
those ever here.

3936
02:56:43,141 --> 02:56:43,974
He dropped out.
Remember when he was running for 

3937
02:56:45,391 --> 02:56:46,224
president and he dropped out and then 
reentered back in late in the race and 

3938
02:56:49,591 --> 02:56:50,424
it was too late,
but he dropped out based on credible 

3939
02:56:53,491 --> 02:56:56,600
threats to the security of his family.
I'm like,

3940
02:56:56,870 --> 02:56:59,280
those are the days that they could just 
scoop your kids up.

3941
02:56:59,310 --> 02:57:00,143
Shit.
You know back in the 80s they can get 

3942
02:57:01,501 --> 02:57:03,720
away with something like that.
They get to actually pull it off.

3943
02:57:03,721 --> 02:57:05,730
Was it the eighties or was it the 
nineties back then?

3944
02:57:06,220 --> 02:57:07,053
[inaudible] 90 I think he ran in 
[inaudible] 90 but anything pre 

3945
02:57:09,510 --> 02:57:11,070
internet.
Well,

3946
02:57:11,130 --> 02:57:12,100
let's see what it is.
And He,

3947
02:57:12,210 --> 02:57:13,043
Jamie,
1992 campaign Dol Perot says he quit in 

3948
02:57:16,171 --> 02:57:21,171
July to thwart g gop dirty tricks 
decision July in a matter of a campaign.

3949
02:57:21,271 --> 02:57:22,020
But bubba,
I said,

3950
02:57:22,020 --> 02:57:22,853
had withdrawn hearing,
President Bush's campaign was scheming 

3951
02:57:24,601 --> 02:57:25,434
to smear his daughter with a computer 
altered photograph and to disrupt her 

3952
02:57:28,950 --> 02:57:29,783
wedding.

3953
02:57:30,030 --> 02:57:30,863
Mr Pro offered no evidence,
but I thought it was also worried about 

3954
02:57:33,361 --> 02:57:35,880
kidnapping.
Can't prove any of it today.

3955
02:57:36,170 --> 02:57:38,940
I said on tonight's CBS news program,
60 minutes,

3956
02:57:39,540 --> 02:57:40,373
but it was a risk and a risk.
I did not have to take my daughter's 

3957
02:57:44,430 --> 02:57:47,460
concerned and a risk I would not take 
where my daughter's concerned.

3958
02:57:48,190 --> 02:57:49,470
Hmm.
Who knows,

3959
02:57:49,471 --> 02:57:50,320
man?
Well,

3960
02:57:50,340 --> 02:57:52,550
it scared him and he's a tough,
he was a tough guy.

3961
02:57:52,640 --> 02:57:54,320
There's no,
he's still alive with,

3962
02:57:54,360 --> 02:57:56,940
we need a prototype character.
So Richard Branson,

3963
02:57:56,941 --> 02:57:57,840
American,
no,

3964
02:57:58,470 --> 02:57:59,221
dammit.
But that's,

3965
02:57:59,221 --> 02:58:00,780
you know,
trump has a little of that,

3966
02:58:00,810 --> 02:58:02,100
right?
Trump is saying,

3967
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:04,170
why are we sending these jobs over here 
and why?

3968
02:58:04,180 --> 02:58:05,013
Right.
So he's that he's garnering up some of 

3969
02:58:07,111 --> 02:58:08,020
that.
If it works,

3970
02:58:08,190 --> 02:58:09,930
what did he gets in and he actually does
a good job.

3971
02:58:11,020 --> 02:58:11,920
Yeah.
What if,

3972
02:58:12,140 --> 02:58:14,280
what if he gets in and just has everyone
suck his dick?

3973
02:58:14,281 --> 02:58:15,750
Shut up.
Fuck off.

3974
02:58:15,870 --> 02:58:17,010
Well,
the rest of you're fired.

3975
02:58:17,220 --> 02:58:18,780
Everyone's fired.
Well that's kind of,

3976
02:58:18,810 --> 02:58:19,643
that's why,
that's why the Republican establishment 

3977
02:58:21,630 --> 02:58:23,070
doesn't like,
doesn't like him.

3978
02:58:23,250 --> 02:58:24,930
It's not that he's reckless.
It's that he's,

3979
02:58:25,290 --> 02:58:30,290
he's rich and he also holds views in the
past that were more left than right.

3980
02:58:30,970 --> 02:58:32,400
Yeah.
You know,

3981
02:58:32,910 --> 02:58:36,120
he's a complex dude.
His complex dude who farted me.

3982
02:58:36,780 --> 02:58:38,580
It smells like bear.
It's not that bad.

3983
02:58:40,520 --> 02:58:42,480
Um,
Tom Papa,

3984
02:58:42,481 --> 02:58:44,070
where you next man?
Where can people see ya?

3985
02:58:44,180 --> 02:58:45,660
Um,

3986
02:58:45,661 --> 02:58:50,240
I am going to a levity live.
Which one is not Yak.

3987
02:58:50,310 --> 02:58:50,910
Oh,
that's a good one.

3988
02:58:50,910 --> 02:58:52,590
I act in New York.
I'm going there soon.

3989
02:58:52,591 --> 02:58:53,580
Thanks.
Yeah,

3990
02:58:53,581 --> 02:58:55,140
it's a good club.
It's a good spot.

3991
02:58:55,620 --> 02:58:59,820
And I'm a shooting my special in a,
the end of June.

3992
02:58:59,821 --> 02:59:00,960
It looks like,
what are you doing it for?

3993
02:59:01,510 --> 02:59:03,630
A epics,
Hulu and Amazon.

3994
02:59:03,690 --> 02:59:04,760
Excellent.
Yeah.

3995
02:59:04,900 --> 02:59:05,733
How Amazon's getting into things the 
same way a Netflix says they went their 

3996
02:59:07,891 --> 02:59:10,560
own original programming and yeah,
that's cool man.

3997
02:59:10,590 --> 02:59:11,970
Yeah,
this show that I'm,

3998
02:59:12,660 --> 02:59:14,850
I a,
I write on the show called Red Oaks,

3999
02:59:14,851 --> 02:59:17,490
which is Amazon show that Paul risers in
red oaks.

4000
02:59:17,640 --> 02:59:19,710
It's all heard of it.
So it's good to brand new.

4001
02:59:20,250 --> 02:59:22,960
One season's out and we're shooting the 
next season.

4002
02:59:22,961 --> 02:59:25,260
There's so much content today.
It's amazing.

4003
02:59:25,261 --> 02:59:26,550
Crazy.
It's amazing.

4004
02:59:26,610 --> 02:59:27,630
I know.
I'm going to shoot,

4005
02:59:27,660 --> 02:59:31,530
I'm going to do a,
a role in it too in a couple of weeks.

4006
02:59:31,570 --> 02:59:32,730
Nice.
And uh,

4007
02:59:33,250 --> 02:59:33,991
yeah,
it's on Amazon.

4008
02:59:33,991 --> 02:59:34,824
You'd like it.
It's all about a country club in the 

4009
02:59:36,660 --> 02:59:36,660
80s.

4010
02:59:36,660 --> 02:59:37,493
It's just like an eighties caddyshack 
kind of a show and polarizers in it and 

4011
02:59:40,891 --> 02:59:41,724
uh,
Richard kind and you really funny the 

4012
02:59:43,741 --> 02:59:47,670
Amazon has the new version of top gear.
Oh really?

4013
02:59:47,700 --> 02:59:48,533
Yeah.
You want with that I'm on with Jeremy 

4014
02:59:50,850 --> 02:59:52,650
Clarkson and Richard May and James 
Hammond,

4015
02:59:52,890 --> 02:59:55,920
the original crew were top gear.
Do you know the whole story behind it?

4016
02:59:56,280 --> 02:59:58,530
The guy punched one of the producers.
They fired him.

4017
02:59:58,531 --> 02:59:59,340
Jeremy Clarkson.
Yeah,

4018
02:59:59,340 --> 03:00:00,180
it's pretty great.
Yeah,

4019
03:00:00,181 --> 03:00:01,530
he's awesome.
But,

4020
03:00:01,540 --> 03:00:03,990
uh,
yeah,

4021
03:00:03,991 --> 03:00:06,120
him and the producer like get along 
fine.

4022
03:00:06,121 --> 03:00:06,661
They just,
you know,

4023
03:00:06,661 --> 03:00:09,980
they had a blow up and in the what to do
with the English BBC,

4024
03:00:10,020 --> 03:00:11,820
they had a bit of a row,
bit of a row,

4025
03:00:11,910 --> 03:00:13,170
knocked him out,
you know,

4026
03:00:13,290 --> 03:00:14,123
it probably would have to be fine now 
and something happened and they fired 

4027
03:00:15,961 --> 03:00:17,050
him.
And um,

4028
03:00:17,310 --> 03:00:19,020
the other two guys were like,
we're with you dude.

4029
03:00:19,080 --> 03:00:23,040
We're not going anywhere.
And so they recast top gear right now.

4030
03:00:23,041 --> 03:00:25,770
Top in the UTA Ucas,
like five new hosts.

4031
03:00:26,790 --> 03:00:27,960
Yeah.
So it's uh,

4032
03:00:28,020 --> 03:00:31,530
one of them being my friend Richard 
Harris who's amazing or Chris Harris.

4033
03:00:31,590 --> 03:00:32,750
I shouldn't,
he's really my friend.

4034
03:00:32,751 --> 03:00:35,040
I should actually name good name though.
I think of Richard Hammond,

4035
03:00:35,041 --> 03:00:36,480
Chris,
this 20 fucking English people,

4036
03:00:36,780 --> 03:00:40,110
but Chris Harris is my favorite,
a British Carter Mum,

4037
03:00:40,130 --> 03:00:41,790
one of my favorite journalists,
period.

4038
03:00:42,230 --> 03:00:43,370
Car Journalist.
Oh yeah.

4039
03:00:43,380 --> 03:00:44,213
He's awesome at it.
And he's just one of the new top gear 

4040
03:00:45,271 --> 03:00:46,260
guys.
Chris Harris,

4041
03:00:46,290 --> 03:00:47,840
Chris Harris,
and um,

4042
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:49,310
but Richard Hat,
Richard Hunt,

4043
03:00:49,530 --> 03:00:50,363
Richard Hammond and James May and Jeremy
Clarkson or the original Dream Team and 

4044
03:00:54,360 --> 03:00:55,193
those guys together were,
there was the most popular show in the 

4045
03:00:57,931 --> 03:00:59,410
whole world.
They were awesome.

4046
03:00:59,440 --> 03:01:00,010
The world,

4047
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:02,650
the whole world.
And when it got canceled,

4048
03:01:02,710 --> 03:01:05,230
you know,
they moved over to Amazon so they had to

4049
03:01:05,231 --> 03:01:06,064
wait a certain amount of time.
I think it's been over a year and now 

4050
03:01:09,191 --> 03:01:11,890
they're going to do it on Amazon.
So that's great.

4051
03:01:12,160 --> 03:01:14,230
It'll boost Amazon for sure.
For sure.

4052
03:01:14,231 --> 03:01:16,040
And uh,
maybe it'll boost Tom Paul.

4053
03:01:16,150 --> 03:01:17,650
Yeah.
Maybe my little special be good.

4054
03:01:17,980 --> 03:01:21,370
And I'm still cranking out my podcasts,
my come to Papa podcast.

4055
03:01:21,580 --> 03:01:22,413
It's a little endeavor and that's it.
Do you have a little studio set up at 

4056
03:01:26,141 --> 03:01:28,540
your place?
I just have like this little,

4057
03:01:28,541 --> 03:01:29,374
uh,
h four recorder and he's bring it 

4058
03:01:32,281 --> 03:01:33,490
places.
I just have it.

4059
03:01:33,520 --> 03:01:34,353
No,
I do it.

4060
03:01:34,360 --> 03:01:38,290
Well,
I do the Sirius Xm show and uh,

4061
03:01:38,320 --> 03:01:42,070
I do that in the studio and then it 
moves on raw dog.

4062
03:01:42,460 --> 03:01:44,290
Okay.
I've been doing that for a long time and

4063
03:01:44,291 --> 03:01:46,180
then he leaves live.
Come to papa shows,

4064
03:01:46,181 --> 03:01:50,150
which are like a prairie home companion.
You should do it sometime.

4065
03:01:50,230 --> 03:01:52,900
It's really good.
It's like scripted old classic radio.

4066
03:01:52,901 --> 03:01:53,734
We do sketch stuff.
He just read on stage and then some 

4067
03:01:55,840 --> 03:01:58,420
comedians do a set,
he'd do it in the audio music.

4068
03:01:58,660 --> 03:02:01,420
We do it at Largo and then we do it in a
village underground.

4069
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:03,600
And do you have comics to actual stand 
up?

4070
03:02:03,630 --> 03:02:05,640
Yeah,
they do their act on your podcast?

4071
03:02:05,670 --> 03:02:07,350
Yeah.
Why would anybody do that though?

4072
03:02:07,351 --> 03:02:09,000
Because then that releases their 
material.

4073
03:02:09,660 --> 03:02:14,660
Ah.
Who hears it of fucking podcast.

4074
03:02:15,751 --> 03:02:17,550
Is this how many people are living?

4075
03:02:17,690 --> 03:02:18,111
Well,
you know,

4076
03:02:18,111 --> 03:02:18,944
they do older material or they just try 
stuff out or it's only like a five 

4077
03:02:21,081 --> 03:02:22,220
minute set.
Okay.

4078
03:02:22,400 --> 03:02:23,420
Okay.
I don't know.

4079
03:02:23,430 --> 03:02:26,690
Darnt you beyond being so precious with 
your material,

4080
03:02:26,720 --> 03:02:28,180
like don't you want so precious?
Yeah.

4081
03:02:28,200 --> 03:02:29,033
Like people hear it.
I don't care where I do my act at this 

4082
03:02:30,501 --> 03:02:30,871
point.
It's,

4083
03:02:30,871 --> 03:02:32,040
you know,
yeah.

4084
03:02:32,900 --> 03:02:34,250
People want to hear it all the time

4085
03:02:34,600 --> 03:02:35,433
or sitting in front of you with a,
with a camera pointing at you while 

4086
03:02:37,121 --> 03:02:39,670
you're on stage doesn't work out.
If you're working on some new shit,

4087
03:02:39,840 --> 03:02:43,140
it weirds me out,
but I don't care.

4088
03:02:43,230 --> 03:02:44,360
Wow.
Tom Pop.

4089
03:02:44,361 --> 03:02:45,480
You still relaxed?
No.

4090
03:02:45,481 --> 03:02:48,600
But why?
What's the regular foot massages?

4091
03:02:48,900 --> 03:02:51,720
What do you do that keeps you so calm?
I really,

4092
03:02:51,721 --> 03:02:53,850
I kind of stopped worrying about that 
stuff.

4093
03:02:53,870 --> 03:02:54,840
That's good.
Cause I mean,

4094
03:02:54,841 --> 03:02:56,790
everything's everywhere.
Everything's everywhere.

4095
03:02:56,820 --> 03:02:58,470
I put,
so I'm going to put this special out.

4096
03:02:58,800 --> 03:03:01,200
The day it comes out.
Kids are going to rip it,

4097
03:03:01,380 --> 03:03:02,850
put it around for free.
Hopefully.

4098
03:03:03,120 --> 03:03:04,140
Yeah,
hopefully.

4099
03:03:04,200 --> 03:03:05,033
Right.
So you actually want people to steal 

4100
03:03:06,511 --> 03:03:07,344
your stuff in some ways.
So like if you had a show at the ice 

4101
03:03:10,591 --> 03:03:13,650
house and they're like,
they're going to record it.

4102
03:03:14,010 --> 03:03:15,570
I would just shift my thinking like,
all right,

4103
03:03:15,571 --> 03:03:17,280
so I'm not going to do that one bit.
I'll,

4104
03:03:17,400 --> 03:03:19,560
I'll do this other bid or whatever.
You know?

4105
03:03:21,060 --> 03:03:23,340
The point is that people can see it all 
the time,

4106
03:03:23,341 --> 03:03:26,550
everywhere.
So who cares if it's on a podcast,

4107
03:03:27,710 --> 03:03:30,280
I guess,
I guess you can look at it that way.

4108
03:03:30,310 --> 03:03:32,710
I always look at it like when you see it
live,

4109
03:03:33,110 --> 03:03:35,560
leading up to the filming was special.
It's a work in progress.

4110
03:03:35,670 --> 03:03:36,710
Yeah.
And uh,

4111
03:03:36,780 --> 03:03:37,613
if you see it,
it's like you could read spoiler alerts 

4112
03:03:39,221 --> 03:03:41,140
about game of thrones online if you want
to.

4113
03:03:41,200 --> 03:03:42,033
Sure.
But it'll kind of fuck up the story for 

4114
03:03:43,301 --> 03:03:43,790
you.
Right.

4115
03:03:43,790 --> 03:03:48,250
So if you see like bits that are a work 
in progress like six months ago and then

4116
03:03:48,251 --> 03:03:50,680
you see him again,
you get to see the work that's been done

4117
03:03:50,681 --> 03:03:53,020
so you could look at it that way.
Like I see the progress and it's kind of

4118
03:03:53,021 --> 03:03:54,910
cool as a fan of comedy,
do you watch that?

4119
03:03:54,940 --> 03:03:57,670
Like I like watching other people work 
stuff I like,

4120
03:03:57,671 --> 03:03:58,520
like Tony Hinchcliffe

4121
03:03:58,520 --> 03:04:00,350
as this new bit.
I don't want to give away the premise,

4122
03:04:00,590 --> 03:04:03,470
but I've been watching this bit grow and
he comes off and he's like,

4123
03:04:03,471 --> 03:04:05,200
super pumped dude.
You see the new version?

4124
03:04:05,201 --> 03:04:05,931
I'm like,
I love it.

4125
03:04:05,931 --> 03:04:07,010
I love that new thing.
And you know,

4126
03:04:07,011 --> 03:04:08,660
we start talking about it,
but that's,

4127
03:04:08,930 --> 03:04:10,970
I'm a comedy Geek.
I'm,

4128
03:04:11,080 --> 03:04:11,913
I'm,
I like the process itself where some 

4129
03:04:13,851 --> 03:04:16,460
people just want to see the actual bit 
when it's done,

4130
03:04:16,520 --> 03:04:20,280
but that's how I feel like the comedy 
geeks will know my,

4131
03:04:20,670 --> 03:04:24,550
my me do my bit on the podcast and then 
see it in my special ed.

4132
03:04:24,890 --> 03:04:27,110
But the regular fans,
they're just going to see the special.

4133
03:04:27,170 --> 03:04:28,490
I see what you're saying.
You know what I mean?

4134
03:04:28,820 --> 03:04:29,653
I Dunno.
I just feel like it's our job now and 

4135
03:04:32,290 --> 03:04:35,090
the way that,
the way that people can digest material,

4136
03:04:35,360 --> 03:04:38,600
it's our job to crank stuff out and be 
making stuff,

4137
03:04:38,780 --> 03:04:41,600
doing podcasts and doing your material 
and writing books and just,

4138
03:04:41,810 --> 03:04:43,670
just crank and create and put it out 
there.

4139
03:04:43,671 --> 03:04:46,850
So if you see my Ra said at Largo,
that's what you,

4140
03:04:47,090 --> 03:04:50,870
that's what I put out today.
And if I'm going to do my special or I'm

4141
03:04:50,871 --> 03:04:53,990
going to do a thing in red oaks and 
that's that thing,

4142
03:04:54,050 --> 03:04:54,910
you know,
so it's,

4143
03:04:55,020 --> 03:04:57,950
it's just all output from the Papa 
compound,

4144
03:04:58,010 --> 03:04:59,930
the Papa compound,
ladies and gentleman,

4145
03:04:59,931 --> 03:05:01,780
Tom Papa folks.
So great.

4146
03:05:01,870 --> 03:05:03,200
It was fun.
I enjoyed it.

4147
03:05:03,230 --> 03:05:08,210
Nice watching eat bread.
I never thought anybody ever say that by

4148
03:05:08,211 --> 03:05:09,044
fuckers.

4149
03:05:18,840 --> 03:05:19,673
Okay.

4150
03:05:22,020 --> 03:05:22,853
Yeah.
