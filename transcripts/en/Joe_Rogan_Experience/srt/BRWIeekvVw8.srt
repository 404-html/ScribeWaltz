1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:03,270
Ari Mother fucking Shit.

3
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:04,590
Fear has a billboard.

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,750
If there was a movie about your life,

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,590
um,

6
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,870
and then this happened
the way it happened,

7
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,610
I would go,

8
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,220
ah,

9
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,530
they,

10
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:11,681
it,

11
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:12,240
I was too much.

12
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,460
Yeah,

13
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:12,921
too true.

14
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:13,530
Try it.

15
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,363
No Way.

16
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:14,821
Oh,

17
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:18,630
I had a billboard above where he lived
for 10 years as he struggled as he was

18
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:20,430
fucking destitute,

19
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,760
living in this little
shitty area of Hollywood.

20
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,790
13 x a year right next
to the comedy store.

21
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,550
Right down the street from the comedy
store is the cheapest housing near the

22
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:30,210
comedy store.

23
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:30,680
Yeah.

24
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,170
Yeah.

25
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:31,680
It was cool.

26
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,570
I remember every time I'd
visit you and be like,

27
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,411
safe here,

28
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:35,800
can we walk through this thing?

29
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,863
All right.

30
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,011
You live with,

31
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:38,821
it wasn't dangerous,

32
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:39,654
but it was bad.

33
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,670
And then eventually the homeless
people started moving in.

34
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,533
Yeah.

35
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,190
You lived with some sketchy folk.

36
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,191
There was a,

37
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:46,650
like a few people were like,

38
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:48,180
I didn't walk through your halls.

39
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,720
Like I would walk through
the Ritz Carlton's pillow,

40
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,410
like I was on a,

41
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,770
I wouldn't say I'm a code red,

42
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:59,040
but I was on code yellow or whatever
the fuck the Tamarisk code is.

43
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,050
I had a little bit of,

44
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:00,580
we had this,

45
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,030
these,

46
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,621
these horns.

47
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:02,371
It's kind of like that.

48
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:03,360
That bet Brady,

49
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,000
that chain you have there with the beads.

50
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:06,390
Yeah,

51
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,390
it was hanging up with this weird horn
thing like on the railing in a corner and

52
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:12,211
I asked my friend there,

53
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:12,640
I was like,

54
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,361
how long has it been there?

55
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:15,630
It was before I moved in and were like,

56
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:16,200
do you wanna move it?

57
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,130
You fucking move it.

58
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,710
It just looked like Voodoo
Jewish and we were like,

59
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,370
maybe it's keeping the place up and that
thing was there for 10 12 years and you

60
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:27,690
haven't touched it and you had this
great deal where this apartment,

61
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,470
like they wanted to turn it into something
else and they want to sell it's prime

62
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:35,000
real estate sunset and Luciana
go Sansone loss you to get,

63
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,140
if they put a dope apartment
building up in there,

64
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:38,700
people would just kind of want to do.

65
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,200
But everyone above and the hill.

66
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,730
The Richie's got mad though.

67
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,930
Like you're going to block our view.

68
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,260
They're rich and they blocked it forever.

69
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:45,631
Plus,

70
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:46,381
even if it was like,

71
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:46,591
all right,

72
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:48,660
all the new ones that
be no blockage of view,

73
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:50,460
I'm going to put a
rooftop garden on there.

74
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:54,140
So all you'll see is greenery
and flowers say about that.

75
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,563
Still not.

76
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,930
It's going to mess up traffic
while you're building.

77
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,101
He goes,

78
00:01:59,101 --> 00:01:59,311
yeah,

79
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,630
it is gonna mess up traffic a little.

80
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:01,890
And then he got a deal with pink dye goes,

81
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:03,960
how about we only enter through
the pink dot parking lot?

82
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,423
And they were like,

83
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,953
still not.

84
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:07,830
Yeah,

85
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,760
that takes years,

86
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,001
right?

87
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:09,211
Yeah.

88
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:10,470
So then he finally got the okay.

89
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:12,030
People were moving out one by one.

90
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,130
He was given deals to people
and he gave you a deal.

91
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,671
Gave me a deal.

92
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:15,210
I got the deal.

93
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,650
I think I might have been
the last one to get the deal.

94
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,340
And there's a billboard.

95
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,630
This is not Ari's idea.

96
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,830
He didn't ask for this.

97
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,950
There's a billboard above his old fucking
apartment and the billboard above your

98
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:30,090
old fucking apartment.

99
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,090
This is not happening with you.

100
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,070
Got Brow Fun.

101
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,110
I have pictures of me.

102
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,970
Fuck an eagle.

103
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,470
This is America.

104
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,490
We will you will.

105
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,370
You are in that picture on my Instagram.

106
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,750
Look at that picture
because you can see them.

107
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,250
They could see the window of my old,

108
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,240
of my old apartment.

109
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,410
Look at that picture.

110
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:49,591
I,

111
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:51,690
that's one of my favorite
pictures of all time.

112
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,100
Look at that fucking picture.

113
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:53,700
Man.

114
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,460
You're so happy you did it.

115
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,331
That is,

116
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:58,870
that's officially you did it.

117
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,670
Was that last night Jeremy?

118
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,240
No.

119
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,690
Oh,

120
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,010
I mean if you go off
the wall crazy and uh,

121
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,440
jump off a fucking building.

122
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,810
I had a billboard in my feet.

123
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,220
Did it?

124
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,670
Yeah.

125
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,230
That's pretty,

126
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,591
I don't know.

127
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:11,231
I've gotten so much.

128
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,700
People are so much more
excited about this.

129
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:14,200
Then the show or the special,

130
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:14,441
well,

131
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:15,670
the show's awesome.

132
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:16,691
You know,

133
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:17,860
shows awesome.

134
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:18,550
It's great.

135
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,550
But there's something so nutty about the
visual of that billboard above your old

136
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,370
apartment.

137
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,700
The fact that it's right
there is so god damn crazy.

138
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,290
That's your fucking apartment.

139
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,831
Look at that.

140
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:30,730
Where my head is sticking out.

141
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:31,181
That's mine.

142
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,830
That's my bedroom window.

143
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,970
This is insane.

144
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:37,060
This is like some real
weird simulation shit

145
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,300
that's so fucking weird.

146
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,020
It's amazing.

147
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,201
Yeah.

148
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,070
You wouldn't think in a movie.

149
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:42,401
You'd be like,

150
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,360
no fucking way.

151
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,090
I've never been happier for someone else.

152
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,360
Thanks that then watching
this happen to you.

153
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,410
I've never been happier.

154
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:50,980
It's,

155
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,030
it's amazing to see,

156
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:52,361
dude.

157
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,260
It's so cool.

158
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,050
It's so fucking cool.

159
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,980
It's wild.

160
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,710
It's just stuff that
doesn't even seem like,

161
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,741
like again,

162
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:00,940
if that was in a movie and be like,

163
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:01,840
come on,

164
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,810
they put a fucking billboard right
next to the apartment and he'd be like,

165
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,471
no way man.

166
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:05,771
Come on.

167
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:06,604
Make it down the street.

168
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,690
That would still be something.

169
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,961
Yeah,

170
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:10,030
and it would be like a conspiracy theory.

171
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,241
Oh,

172
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:11,230
he fucking course.

173
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:14,320
He told them he wanted the
billboard above his old apartment.

174
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:15,751
It's,

175
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:16,750
it's the comedy central bill,

176
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:19,720
but they bought it like five years ago
and they've been putting stuff up there.

177
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,231
By the way.

178
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:22,480
You lived there way before that.

179
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,643
Exactly.

180
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,690
Do it that,

181
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,021
but man,

182
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:26,471
it sucked.

183
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:27,850
Also walking under it going like,

184
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,684
fuck,

185
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,170
oh,

186
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:29,890
show billboard.

187
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,930
I wished I could get one one day.

188
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,293
Wow.

189
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,350
What a fucking crazy

190
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,121
be alive.

191
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:36,954
That must've been,

192
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,640
you have to give him to religion or die

193
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,910
easy and she shows you that people have
always had that weird desire to have

194
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:51,810
everyone else think exactly the way
they thought and it makes them feel more

195
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:52,350
secure.

196
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,183
Christians,

197
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,230
more Christmas.

198
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,990
It's more Christians.

199
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,580
Jews actually never proselytized don't.

200
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,631
That's amazing,

201
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,020
isn't it?

202
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,470
Yeah.

203
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,180
Why is that?

204
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,020
Because your religion,

205
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,141
it's silly.

206
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:02,740
Is anybody else's based
in the same things?

207
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,020
Yeah,

208
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,660
it was a question.

209
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,990
How come they figured out to like keep
to themselves and you don't have to do

210
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:07,560
this.

211
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,640
There's no reason you should.

212
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,661
If you want to,

213
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:10,081
you can,

214
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,190
but we're not going to try to push it.

215
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:11,401
I was like,

216
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:12,234
do whatever you want.

217
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,051
But time of David,

218
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:13,740
they outlawed it.

219
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,573
Outlawed conversion.

220
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,540
Wow.

221
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,373
It was too popular.

222
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,401
Too popular.

223
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,360
But he wanted to be a judge.

224
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:18,661
You just,

225
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:20,880
because it was like they
were the ruling party really.

226
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:21,870
Damn.

227
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,740
So they outlawed it.

228
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,510
So they said no conversion
during this time.

229
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,600
God for how long was your no,

230
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,241
please.

231
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:27,701
I'm fucking,

232
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:27,831
yeah,

233
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:28,380
I don't know.

234
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,131
Now you have to do that.

235
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:30,050
You have to ask a bunch of times.

236
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,380
I'm just hanging out.

237
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,860
I don't like these people to that.

238
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:34,980
Most of the whites.

239
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,551
I don't want to be that.

240
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:36,690
Every,

241
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,523
you pretty much have to do that.

242
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,460
The Rabi I'll tell you like,

243
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:38,821
don't,

244
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:39,301
don't do this.

245
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:41,420
You don't want to do
it really any big macs.

246
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,181
We can't just trust me.

247
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:45,900
You don't want to do those 20 big macs
if you're had Judy can't eat big MACs,

248
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,793
religious Jew,

249
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,180
you know you're supposed to eat hamburger.

250
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,751
Is that what it is?

251
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:49,620
It's not pushing me.

252
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,320
And it's cheese on there too.

253
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:51,780
Oh,

254
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,340
so just that in general.

255
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:55,500
But you could have kosher beef burgers.

256
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,160
You could have a kosher
beef burger with soy cheese.

257
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,611
Oh,

258
00:05:58,611 --> 00:05:59,444
the cheese.

259
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,050
What does it,

260
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,460
you can't combine milk and meat.

261
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,294
Is that what it is?

262
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,380
What's that all about?

263
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,420
It's pretty much a stupidity.

264
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
It's just like all the religions.

265
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,323
But uh,

266
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,670
it's based on a passage that says you
shall not mix the meat of the mother or

267
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:15,890
the milk of the milk of the
mother with the meat of the calf.

268
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,080
Huh?

269
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,913
Yeah.

270
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,390
Horn instead or anything else?

271
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:22,170
Some sex tech that just to be that it's,

272
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,990
it's that actual mother and calf.

273
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,231
Yeah,

274
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,041
but that's the case.

275
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,010
Why can't you get the milk from the mother
and then kill the mother and he heard

276
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,570
some milk of the mother
and the meat of the mother.

277
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,350
That's all right.

278
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:30,861
I don't run it.

279
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:31,101
Really.

280
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:31,790
Got It.

281
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,460
They just no meat and milk.

282
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,431
You have to wait.

283
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:35,570
If you eat pizza,

284
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,070
you have to wait 30 minutes for you meet.

285
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,210
What are the odds though,

286
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:41,420
if I have a fucking piece of meat that
the nugs going to come from the same?

287
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:41,661
No,

288
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:42,021
it's not.

289
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:45,050
They said that means they said that
passage means don't mix it two at all.

290
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,011
Fuck you.

291
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:46,731
Linen and cotton.

292
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:47,564
You can't mix.

293
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,470
Yeah,

294
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,303
but you can't.

295
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:49,671
If you're,

296
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:50,210
if you have a,

297
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,100
if you have like a a woolen the linen,

298
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,000
that's what it is.

299
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,410
If you have a wool jacket,

300
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,430
you can't have linen things tying in the
buttons cause that's evil and you'll go

301
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:01,200
to hell for now.

302
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,210
My favorite one.

303
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,750
My favorite one that you told me to this
day was that you were told that when

304
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:07,250
you masturbate for that,

305
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:08,330
people don't really know.

306
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,920
Ari grew up extremely religious
to the point where he lived.

307
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,800
You lived on lives in Israel
and your show for two years.

308
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,111
Yeah,

309
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:18,500
I mean that's the Torah all day long.

310
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,380
Nine p on the 10 9:00 AM
to 10:00 PM I mean dad is,

311
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,090
that's some pretty intense shit.

312
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:27,760
And they told you when you masturbated
that you were impregnating a demon and

313
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,320
let's just say you're
on your back lying down.

314
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,470
They didn't really do positions
back then in our shower anyway,

315
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,251
but when you're doing it,

316
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:35,360
some demon comes and like,

317
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:39,350
she's like a round you fucking
you as you're fucking your hand.

318
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,113
Yeah.

319
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,720
And then you make like demon babies and
they have some writer uses the phage.

320
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,260
There was some like maybe
Dean Koontz sh everything.

321
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,350
Coons use it in a movie or
some deep know in a book.

322
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:51,830
There's some,

323
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,900
some demon was like writing
them and had anyway,

324
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:56,480
but then you get her pregnant and she
has babies every time you do that.

325
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,970
Every time you're 100% as babies.

326
00:07:58,971 --> 00:07:59,900
Never going to be one on earth.

327
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:02,840
They only live in this demon
world and Delta formed and gross.

328
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:03,890
Wow.

329
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,910
I forgot about this.

330
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,740
And then when you get to go to heaven,

331
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:07,574
when you die,

332
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,110
you have to meet those demons.

333
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,130
Oh my God.

334
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:10,581
And they got,

335
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:11,870
Why dad?

336
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,870
Why couldn't we born
on the regular planet?

337
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,710
Wow.

338
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,690
Why are we like this dad?

339
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,250
So did you masturbate to,

340
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,701
anyway,

341
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:20,690
even knowing all this,

342
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,570
and what did you think was,

343
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:24,291
was this going on?

344
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,570
Why you were living in this like
really religious environment?

345
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,280
You were asking me and you
never saw him masturbating.

346
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,060
You never stop.

347
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,301
I mean,

348
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:29,991
I slowed down.

349
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:31,460
I thought it was evil for doing it.

350
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,380
Well,

351
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:32,870
like,

352
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,860
so you're doing this,

353
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:36,530
you're there 9:00 AM to
9:00 PM did you think,

354
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:37,820
well that part's bullshit.

355
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,200
You,

356
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,700
you're studying like
this intense religious,

357
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,121
well there's,

358
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,150
I think there's two types of scents.

359
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:42,461
Literally.

360
00:08:42,461 --> 00:08:43,870
This is how it is since 2000 since there,

361
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:45,290
since you plan out and say fuck it.

362
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:45,490
I don't,

363
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,460
I don't agree with that.

364
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,010
And this types like gossip
where it just happens.

365
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,520
You're not thinking about it like fuck,

366
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,670
I shouldn't have done that.

367
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,950
Right.

368
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,710
Talking about about somebody's
masturbation is one that
it just overcomes you,

369
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,380
but it's one,

370
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,360
I guess it's one that you do plan out
cause you could just not do it this time.

371
00:08:59,380 --> 00:08:59,500
Oh,

372
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,600
you accidentally touched it.

373
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,310
Women I don't think have the same.

374
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,841
It's not theirs.

375
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:04,050
They don't have that backup.

376
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,940
You know women want to have sex,

377
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,960
they get itchy.

378
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,860
They want do they want it to be touched?

379
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:10,020
They want affection to get horny.

380
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,530
But we have like a backup of sperm
where like your Dick is like,

381
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:14,700
come on,

382
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,170
let's go.

383
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,450
It's like you got to get rid of this shit.

384
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:19,320
Jesus Christ.

385
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:22,470
We can't even think you can
sour milk from everywhere here.

386
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,880
Come on Jesus.

387
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,930
What did you,

388
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,850
when you beat off did you like fuck?

389
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:27,990
What about those babies?

390
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,160
Did you believe that part?

391
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,140
That part was more like fables is wasn't
like the written Toro was like this is

392
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:34,560
what's,

393
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,600
this is what like the extra curricular,

394
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,130
stuff like that.

395
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,660
So when would they bring that up?

396
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,220
How'd you they barely brought that up.

397
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,840
Did they bring it up in class ever?

398
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,411
Yeah,

399
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:44,051
it would come up.

400
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,720
We're in discussions with rabbis
who studied all that stuff that the,

401
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,850
the um,

402
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,330
the Zahar Zahar when just
like the mystical book,

403
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,910
but you're not supposed to say
that until you're married and 35,

404
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,260
what is it?

405
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,950
Second Mystical Book and said you can't
sell it until you're married and 35 at

406
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:00,784
least set up about it.

407
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,240
It's got all the stuff
about ghosts and weird shit.

408
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,100
Ghosts does go Siemens crossing dude,

409
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:08,611
Judaism.

410
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:09,540
Sounds like fun.

411
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,171
Sounds like fun.

412
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:10,501
Literate.

413
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,580
You don't get to read it very much.

414
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:12,590
I never read the translations.

415
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,321
I was just so hard.

416
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,130
Maybe I should read it.

417
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,090
Can you get it online?

418
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:15,990
Can you babied by now?

419
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,540
It's probably all written
down somewhere actually,

420
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,490
but a lot of it would
be the exact language.

421
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:21,710
You wouldn't get that from transaction.

422
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,643
You look at clothes.

423
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,513
Yeah.

424
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,451
There was this piece,

425
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:26,550
there was this one piece
and a in the Talmud,

426
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,800
which is like a respect to like
you're supposed to study apart.

427
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,701
And they said this,

428
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:30,030
rob,

429
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,531
this rabbi,

430
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:35,531
I went to his students who were living
in like a dormitory altogether because

431
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:40,800
there was a snake or a dragon that was
attacking them every night and killing

432
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:41,634
his students.

433
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,490
So he had his sleep and only the rabbi,

434
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:45,390
it was one who gets to feed it.

435
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:47,250
So he had to sleep
under one of their beds,

436
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,510
um,

437
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,830
so that he could kill this dragon.

438
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,893
It was a dragon.

439
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,320
And I asked my rabbi about that.

440
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:52,531
I'm like,

441
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:53,910
what the fuck is this all about?

442
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,233
Uh,

443
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,280
it's my way.

444
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,061
What's going on?

445
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:58,290
Does not seconds dragons.

446
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,300
This is all under this
bed to suck your cock.

447
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:01,380
And that's how I killed the Dragon.

448
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:01,651
Yeah.

449
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:03,000
He said there was a rash,

450
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,160
there was a rash of jerk offs going on.

451
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,140
And the only way that he did,

452
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,970
they can't really write
that out in the Talmud.

453
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,230
So they had a metaphor.

454
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:11,850
It was a rash of jerk offs.

455
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:12,690
And the only way I could stop it.

456
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:14,870
It's a rabbi hiding under the bed saying,

457
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,713
I call you.

458
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,040
You're masturbating.

459
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,180
Wow.

460
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:22,750
So the dragon that was killing off the
children was just them masturbating,

461
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,030
desire to masturbate.

462
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,520
Oh my God.

463
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:26,730
Their spiritual selves.

464
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,960
Holy Shit.

465
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:28,920
That's Hilarious,

466
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,310
Mia.

467
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,390
But it's not written.

468
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:31,800
That metaphor is not explained.

469
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:32,310
It's just,

470
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:37,080
it's just assumed and you have to ask
someone who understands the tax or Rashi,

471
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:38,910
but it looked quite stuff about it.

472
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:39,690
If you can understand that.

473
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,371
That's so crazy,

474
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:40,860
man.

475
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,011
Well,

476
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:42,510
how would that in the future,

477
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:44,130
people would just think
it's just craziness.

478
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:45,370
This was an oral tradition too,

479
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,500
so it wasn't even written down.

480
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,940
Someone just had to tell you that story.

481
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:48,840
Wow.

482
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,490
That's what they wrote down when they
thought they were going to lose it all.

483
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,170
That's amazing.

484
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,733
Wow.

485
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:53,980
That

486
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,660
is a great fucking story,

487
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,620
I think to be making that up,

488
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:57,454
but I'm really not.

489
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,570
It's hilarious.

490
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,730
We're so crazy.

491
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,470
Have you had your man period lately?

492
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,200
No.

493
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,500
What's that?

494
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,610
And I have this theory that when we shit,

495
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,000
then it's all bloody in there that
it's possible that he does it.

496
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:11,770
At the same time like
it's based on the moon.

497
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,151
How often do you guys,

498
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:14,230
shit when you get the one year,

499
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,330
shit happens,

500
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,450
happens every couple of months.

501
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:18,670
It goes for like a week week.

502
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,070
Those are the hemorrhoid thing.

503
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,550
Oh my God.

504
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,720
And then you wipe and you just like,

505
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,951
ah,

506
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:26,960
I'm still wiping a lot of shit.

507
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:27,220
You're like,

508
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,381
no,

509
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:28,960
it's just soaking red blood.

510
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:29,291
That's all.

511
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,041
There's no shame in it.

512
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,790
Die On your hand and go straight
through the toilet paper.

513
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,490
You guys both need to go to a doctor
together and find out what aliens are

514
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:38,110
raping you in the [inaudible] Shit study.

515
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,050
Imagine what you a fucking
camera over your bed.

516
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,110
That's what really watched aliens come
in the room and take you through the

517
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:45,080
walls in the middle of the night.

518
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,140
Return you later.

519
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,760
It's sometimes when you
stand up at your toilet seat.

520
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:49,690
Looks like Dexter,

521
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:49,940
like,

522
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,131
like,

523
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:51,690
like the blood spots that you know from.

524
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,380
It didn't go in the water if you have
too low and if you guys are both shit,

525
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:56,530
not that much blood.

526
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,310
Yeah,

527
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,143
I mean it pours.

528
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,060
It's the warmth.

529
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,240
It's like a warm faucet,

530
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,510
just take a beaker and turn it over real
beaker and turn it over like about that

531
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:08,900
amount of the shot for the shot girls.

532
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,820
Those like about that much water.

533
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,380
Not something to be proud of.

534
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,990
You guys are both really sick.

535
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:14,360
Jamie.

536
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,250
You okay over there?

537
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,910
Are you and I in the same boat?

538
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,320
I can tell you this though.

539
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:21,800
I did have a massive
diarrhea problem last week.

540
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,590
It was really worst diarrhea
problem a long time.

541
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:27,860
I do not know multiple days
or one diarrhea multiple days.

542
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,660
I don't know if it was a stomach cold.

543
00:13:29,661 --> 00:13:32,930
I don't know if it was something that I
ate that didn't agree with me but it was

544
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:35,710
like one day I had a headache and my my,

545
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,531
I was like wow,

546
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:40,280
I feel so I think it's
like a food poisoning issue
cause I had an ha a headache

547
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:40,701
and I was like,

548
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:41,061
man,

549
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:41,894
I feel weak.

550
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,950
It was the Hannibal.

551
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:43,701
No,

552
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:44,534
definitely not.

553
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,433
Definitely for that.

554
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,490
Yeah it was.

555
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:46,900
Um,

556
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,300
no it was,

557
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,480
it was post ham but I
hadn't eaten a ham for days.

558
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,530
But it definitely wasn't that.

559
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:55,160
It was something that it had I think
that day or before that day anyways,

560
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,150
diarrhea.

561
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,290
Oh my goodness mean it was more
than a week after I'd eaten the Ham.

562
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,190
Now that I think about it.

563
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,520
Did you mix it with the regular
dump and have like a no dude,

564
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:05,354
it was just over the,

565
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,180
this is what happened or
whatever was going on inside.

566
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,370
My stomach was converting everything.

567
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:14,360
I ate into this liquid and
I didn't even make sense.

568
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:15,860
It was like defined physics.

569
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:16,850
How solidified was it?

570
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,290
It was water.

571
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:23,210
If you dropped it on a UN inclined
table at a 40 degree in client,

572
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:24,500
would it go straight off the table?

573
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,770
Take a minute to go ride like a fucking
great wave straight through great brown

574
00:14:29,931 --> 00:14:31,250
wave of destruction.

575
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:31,851
Dude.

576
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:32,601
It would rumble.

577
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:34,400
My stomach would rumble
and then I would go,

578
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,190
oh shit and I'd have to really bathroom.

579
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,801
Then I'd get to the,

580
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:39,350
and I would hold it up in
commercials like listen,

581
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,010
I would,

582
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,750
there's no way I was brave enough to fart.

583
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,100
There was no way.

584
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,640
There was no way cause I would get into
that tub or get it all over the bowl

585
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:49,720
rather and it would just hear whoosh,

586
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,260
uh,

587
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,470
just water tub shooting out of my ass.

588
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,130
Wow.

589
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,150
Complete water for like two days and
then it became like very untrustworthy

590
00:14:59,151 --> 00:14:59,984
shit.

591
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,230
I feel solid swarth day.

592
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,293
Yeah.

593
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,230
And I got hemorrhoids.

594
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:11,231
I had to go get preparation h oh no
I bought squeezing it and pushing it,

595
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,860
trying to get it to come out for so long,

596
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:13,880
which is really bad.

597
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,380
Pushed air bubbles into your asshole.

598
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,041
Well I think,

599
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:16,191
you know,

600
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,170
squeezing your ass like that,

601
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:20,750
trying to poop is very bad for you.

602
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:21,590
You're not supposed to do that.

603
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:23,870
And that's apparently one of the
things that causes hemorrhoids.

604
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,620
Log dumps.

605
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,041
So then,

606
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,960
but the preparation h
is a mother fucker dude.

607
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,100
Cause one day of that
cleared it right up really,

608
00:15:29,101 --> 00:15:31,130
really quickly to get the
cooling like cool ranch.

609
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,360
When are the cool

610
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,250
for cool ranch sense?

611
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,360
Smell refreshing.

612
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,340
Find out people are
like putting it on food.

613
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,790
You can't eat that sir.

614
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,710
It tastes just like it.

615
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,950
Preparation h measured
preparation h was totally edible.

616
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,163
Yeah.

617
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,270
Whatever it does it,

618
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,320
it really works good at fixing any
sort of a hemorrhoid situation.

619
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:54,381
He got down there,

620
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:55,670
they went away like within a day.

621
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,890
But man for fucking days,

622
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,650
four days of totally untrustworthy shits,

623
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,980
the pasty shit where it's like
you could spread it on brick.

624
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,550
Oh I could spread it.

625
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,320
Yeah it was like leaves in there and
shit cause I still eat healthy but it was

626
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:10,310
like a lot of liquid.

627
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,620
It was some sort of a stomach bug,

628
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,790
whatever it was.

629
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,331
Um,

630
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:18,650
I don't have any idea where it came
from food or whether it came from just

631
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:20,150
catching a cold and you know,

632
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,460
that this cold manifested
itself as a stomach bug,

633
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,960
but whatever it was,

634
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:24,261
man,

635
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:26,780
it was crazy for a few
day and I felt real weak.

636
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,010
Like I'd go to pull my bow back and it
was like kind of difficult to pull the

637
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:31,760
bow back.

638
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,840
Cause you're waiting from stumping.

639
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,913
Yeah,

640
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,570
I was weak.

641
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,590
I was weak.

642
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,370
Like I would like pick things out having,

643
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:38,751
yeah,

644
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:39,321
I could feel it.

645
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:40,154
Her friends.

646
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:40,700
Yeah,

647
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,130
definitely dehydrated but also
just I wasn't eating right.

648
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:44,510
Like I was scared.

649
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:44,710
No,

650
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,920
I wasn't getting hungry either.

651
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,360
I mean I was eating right in that I was
to having like lettuce and salads and

652
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:50,691
stuff like that,

653
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:52,010
but I wasn't eating very much.

654
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,390
I wasn't eating like,

655
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:53,650
uh,

656
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,570
like light meals during the day because
my stomach was so untrustworthy.

657
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,760
When that happened with diarrhea,

658
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,640
what is it?

659
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,120
What's happening?

660
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,751
I don't know man,

661
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,210
but whatever it was just
digesting it just too much.

662
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,380
I would eat like a steak.

663
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:06,560
I would have steak and some salad
and it would turn it a water.

664
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,500
Like how does steak and a salad become?

665
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,130
I mean my,

666
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,480
my body was liquefying it and
they would come out just whoa,

667
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:15,550
what is that?

668
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,110
That's,

669
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,270
is it too much stomach acid that just
breaking down and write everything and Mel

670
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:19,850
session,

671
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,830
I don't know the process.

672
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:24,500
I should probably know that you should
have shut shit on your hand a little bit

673
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,210
and sort of smelled it right
then and see if it was that well,

674
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,440
I took us some on it.

675
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:31,110
Enzymes on enzymes are
all in a digestion on it.

676
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:31,970
Pippy piles.

677
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,290
That's how it got me out of it.

678
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,413
God.

679
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,170
I just had to do the time.

680
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,740
I just had to let my body process.

681
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:40,070
It sounds you just drink a
lot of water put in the Reps.

682
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,521
Yeah,

683
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:40,820
it was.

684
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,120
I was definitely thinking that I was
probably getting dehydrated from,

685
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,090
I was like so much water's coming out
of my ass like I better make sure I just

686
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,510
drink a lot to go with it.

687
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,321
All right.

688
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:51,750
Does your hemorrhoid it happens is
do you even feel that the hemorrhage,

689
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:52,810
cause I can still feel it.

690
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,460
I feel like it's like,

691
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,120
oh I still have,

692
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,250
there's still some stuff I've
got to wipe off really like,

693
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,040
oh it's just my mind.

694
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,090
Just a little while.

695
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,480
My bleeds I go away
cause like a giant tour.

696
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,920
That's just my ass now my,

697
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,990
that's my shit right there.

698
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:08,130
It feels like what leads out.

699
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,390
It doesn't even feel anything.

700
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:10,050
It just,

701
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,560
that's that wheel that exploded
inside or isn't it in a way inside.

702
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:14,091
Don't even feel it.

703
00:18:14,091 --> 00:18:14,924
Mindset.

704
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,040
They're a diet that you can
take stops that from happening.

705
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,420
Probably stopped behind hemorrhoids.

706
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:22,260
Finding foods.

707
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,060
Stop eating from Jack's

708
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,060
lodge up inside your anal binding foods
and stay away from them or eat a lot of

709
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:30,181
them.

710
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:30,960
I forget what it is.

711
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,600
Oh well you should probably
know it's one of those two.

712
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:34,770
So rice was in that group.

713
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,350
Binding foods are definitely away
from him or keep eat a lot of them.

714
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,710
I don't really go by the regimen,

715
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,450
but if you do do that it would
help prevent hemorrhoids.

716
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,853
Um,

717
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:46,950
yes,

718
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,850
that's my dogs don't want to.

719
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:48,210
Got It.

720
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:48,810
And um,

721
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,460
that's the knights.

722
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,610
Do you need a lot of salads?

723
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:51,444
Research?

724
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:51,871
Um,

725
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:52,470
yeah.

726
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,870
Yeah.

727
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,880
Does that help at all?

728
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,361
I don't know.

729
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:55,710
I feel like it makes you shit more often.

730
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:56,401
Yeah.

731
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,060
But if you,

732
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,480
um,

733
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,800
if you doesn't it come out
like we need a lot of salads.

734
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:00,840
It comes out real easy.

735
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,440
Woo.

736
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,010
Oh right.

737
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:02,131
Yeah.

738
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:03,360
That's I guess a scraping,

739
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,260
pushing.

740
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,510
I used to pray it was so jacket,

741
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,430
it'd be so jacket that I would pray to
have it come out cause it hurts so bad.

742
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,400
Oh that's horrible.

743
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,100
That was so inflamed in there.

744
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,900
Cause I was just wasn't dumping
because I knew it would be bad.

745
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:16,231
So I was like,

746
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:17,280
let me hold it for another few days.

747
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,121
Oh my God.

748
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:19,040
Days of dumping

749
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,320
held off from days at a time.

750
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,750
That's insane.

751
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,000
Shit.

752
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,833
Every week.

753
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,230
Dude.

754
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,470
That is so insane.

755
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,020
That's so insane.

756
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,120
I've never even heard that's toxic.

757
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,160
I guess so for sure.

758
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:34,290
You're containing all
that stuff in your body.

759
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,640
It's supposed to be evacuated.

760
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,900
Well it's in that spot.

761
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,531
Whatever.

762
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:38,131
That spot is.

763
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:38,964
Not Rubber.

764
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,500
It fucking filled up dump,

765
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,730
but it we become too big for my ow.

766
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,360
Ow.

767
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,130
Jesus separate.

768
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,330
It's like your first time,

769
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,040
your first time doing it.

770
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:49,350
Ain't no,

771
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,400
you fucked men go.

772
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,480
It's like,

773
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,530
that's pretty much what it was.

774
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,040
Might use the asshole and it was
probably all dried up in there.

775
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:56,211
Right?

776
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:56,850
Right up.

777
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,391
Oh yeah,

778
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:57,680
try.

779
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,110
Yeah.

780
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,700
Pizza.

781
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,200
Jagat Chuck Tearing
you apart is your shit.

782
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,820
I would have to reach
in some times in terror.

783
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,520
Oh,

784
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:05,354
you had to do that.

785
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,170
Oh my God.

786
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,281
This is a,

787
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:11,080
Jamie's been top five William Deval songs.

788
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,300
Last couple of why that looks.

789
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,830
Where with the three d glasses on.

790
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,420
I'm not happy with these

791
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,163
positive.

792
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:23,850
We get it.

793
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,530
We get it sounds like a white guy.

794
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,250
Yeah.

795
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,083
Sounds like planes.

796
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,833
But yeah,

797
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,813
we got it.

798
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,600
How's your ball's been Ari?

799
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,720
Everything down style because we
never write to you about your,

800
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,430
your balls and your butts
and stuff like that.

801
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,940
Thought I had herpes.

802
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,313
Oh that's right.

803
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,280
Really positive.

804
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,114
I had herpes.

805
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,130
I mean really positive.

806
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,770
Like what was the symptom log on
to one is 10 at 10 I was in nine.

807
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,111
I go,

808
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:48,701
it was like fuck.

809
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:49,570
Well I got herpes,

810
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:54,250
the Sims is where I saw a scab
on my dick and I was like,

811
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,791
well that's,

812
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,340
and then I looked it
up on Google on images.

813
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,511
What else do you think it is?

814
00:20:58,511 --> 00:20:58,960
Herpes,

815
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,530
herpes,

816
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,880
herpes scars or whatever.

817
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:03,220
Herpes outbreaks and it
didn't look like most of them.

818
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:06,070
It looked about like one out of
like 10 of them are real life case.

819
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,240
Never had them before,

820
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:07,661
but I was like,

821
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:08,494
look,

822
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,330
I'm not the most careful guy in the world.

823
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,723
I mean condoms,

824
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,990
condoms.

825
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,030
Uh,

826
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,870
so I was like,

827
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:17,590
well look,

828
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,460
it's caught up to me.

829
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,360
I guess this is,

830
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,051
this is fucking,

831
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:20,321
you know,

832
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:20,801
get it now.

833
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:22,300
It's better than I got when I was 25.

834
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,470
I wish right now we could play.

835
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:23,741
Damn,

836
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,940
it feels good to be a gangster.

837
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,810
See in 10 different countries at least.

838
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,070
Oh is it a bunch of countries.

839
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,731
And I was like,

840
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:30,911
look,

841
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:32,050
this could have happened at any point,

842
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:34,990
but I narrowed it down to who
I thought he probably was.

843
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:37,680
I called like three or
four girls or girls.

844
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:37,990
Hey,

845
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,010
I think I have herpes.

846
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,993
Uh,

847
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,841
uh,

848
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,260
you should,

849
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,950
you should go get tested
and stop fucking Damon.

850
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,520
Like why am I have a outbreak?

851
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,181
I have a herpes out,

852
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:47,320
but there's no way there's anything else.

853
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,190
I have a herpes outbreak.

854
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,001
Yeah.

855
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:50,050
Cause what else could it be?

856
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,700
You just don't wake up and have a scab.

857
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,563
Exactly.

858
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,190
And um,

859
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,770
so I scheduled the blood work,

860
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,320
get everything taken care of and in the
meantime we can know what's going to

861
00:21:59,321 --> 00:21:59,501
take us.

862
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:00,550
It's over Christmas weekend,

863
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:01,510
so it's going to take longer.

864
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,550
And then while I was hanging out,

865
00:22:04,551 --> 00:22:05,430
I was hanging out the stand.

866
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,713
How many club?

867
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,230
Maybe the best club in New York,

868
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,820
but I'm talking to the owner and Pete Lee,

869
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:15,070
this comedian and tell them my problem.

870
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,940
And Pete was like,

871
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,480
you know I had,

872
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,760
where is it like right
underneath the hood of Your Dick?

873
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,001
I'm like,

874
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:19,241
yeah,

875
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,074
right there.

876
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,311
He's like,

877
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:23,200
I had something like this once.

878
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,580
It was like a penile tear.

879
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,190
Have you done anything like rough lately?

880
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:28,751
And I was like,

881
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:29,320
yeah,

882
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,410
actually I noticed it right
after unlubricated anal sex.

883
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,770
That's when I first noticed it,

884
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,650
but it just didn't go away.

885
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,030
And lucky you're alive.

886
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,020
I'm lucky I'm alive.

887
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,430
And that's what it turned out to be.

888
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,620
How do you have unlubricated anal sex?

889
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:46,030
That's like fucking hard,

890
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,740
bro.

891
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,141
Hard.

892
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:47,330
I mean,

893
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,070
I know spit,

894
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,050
you didn't spit on the task force was wet.

895
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,000
It was wet or duck.

896
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,040
And that jug is delayed.

897
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,581
Yeah,

898
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:59,230
you get it wet and then
you can fucking go for it.

899
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:00,200
I don't know this,

900
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,091
but yeah,

901
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:01,924
when she got to do,

902
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,370
but you just believed
commercial lubricate.

903
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:05,260
So relieved.

904
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:05,950
Yeah.

905
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,970
And I'm telling you,

906
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,710
if you think your wife has been
happy when you've called before,

907
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,530
after fucking three days on the
road and not being able to call,

908
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,300
you've never heard.

909
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,350
You tell a girl,

910
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,640
oh I was wrong.

911
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,260
You don't have herpes.

912
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,210
They get elated overcome with joy.

913
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,810
Now do you think maybe you should have
just waited till the results came back

914
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,750
showing these guys and you just didn't
want them to fuck somebody else in the

915
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:35,110
meantime and then while I'm waiting to
side some other guy's life is ruined.

916
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,010
Right?

917
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,610
Well I heard this is the Mesil suck it
up and take my lumps also on the other

918
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:40,120
level,

919
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,520
I figured I could tell them I'm
90% sure it was like a cop out.

920
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,990
So I'm not like fully saying,

921
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,201
look,

922
00:23:44,201 --> 00:23:44,710
I have it.

923
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,530
We fucked.

924
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,400
I thought that,

925
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:46,790
uh,

926
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,050
from what I understood when I got tested
was that you can only test herpes while

927
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:51,950
the outbreaks happen.

928
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:56,270
Then the act actually spoon a little out
of the outbursts that you can't really,

929
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:57,830
it's really hard to test for herpes.

930
00:23:57,831 --> 00:24:01,820
So a lot of times you can get tested
during like not an outbreak and be like,

931
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:02,121
oh yeah.

932
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:02,450
And you wanted,

933
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,530
which was positive for herpes?

934
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:03,950
No,

935
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,000
I think it was an old tests.

936
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,470
I think that was like 15 years ago.

937
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:07,304
Toast.

938
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,990
They need Olympic style.

939
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,833
Herbie's tough

940
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,510
for serious overcome his boy.

941
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,363
And

942
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,720
I'd heard if you do pop it like
you could actually taste it.

943
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:20,420
It tastes herpes.

944
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:20,600
Yeah.

945
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,680
It's like a sweetness.

946
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,030
How many different fucking
woes before herpes is like,

947
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:26,750
I got it.

948
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:26,961
Yeah.

949
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:30,270
You can't just say it's the ones that
might just be that buzz Sauvignon blog.

950
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,410
This person has had it
for a while and treated,

951
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,600
it's a burgundy

952
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,200
burgundy's the on

953
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:44,570
culture swiffer around
like a penis in your hand.

954
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,070
Look at the legs and that Herbie,

955
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,513
ah,

956
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,400
how?

957
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,831
How many,

958
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:51,560
how many herpes is you have to build
a taste to be able to taste herpes.

959
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,650
They figured out a way to
train dogs to smell cancer.

960
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,563
Yeah.

961
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,680
That's awesome.

962
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:07,990
Okay.
