1

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,763
Here's in the house

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,260
dropping mad accountant type science on,
you

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,620
know,
stereotype there.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,580
Keep on rocking in the free world.
Ladies and gentlemen, this weekend, this,

13
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,760
this uh,
Friday night at Mandalay Bay theater.

14
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,130
I will be joined by none other bin.

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,770
Thanks man. I love that place. It's an
awesome place. We ran the liberty theater.

16
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:59,090
Gummy bears can be Cherries, the cherries,
the diary bootcamps, savage, delicious,

17
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,090
terrible for your liver. Right?
Did these have the Gel in them?

18
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:05,810
Cause I got me turned onto gummies
with Gel and that's not squishy.

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,660
We are willing to eat anything as
long as it as a fucking flavor.

20
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:11,900
There's nothing in nature like this. No.
You found something in nature like this,

21
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:16,340
this is bad. This is bad. It's like it
looks radioactive or something. Yeah.

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,230
Like what is this? This is a, this
is pus out of some rhinos ball sack.

23
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,220
You know there's not
supposed to be this chewy,

24
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:23,820
they're not flavored like cherries.

25
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,160
They're shaped like cherries
designing the look jewelry.

26
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:29,930
So that texture is nothing,
uh, nothing in nature.

27
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,250
And they just pretended cherry flavor
tastes like Cherry Cherry play doesn't his

28
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,920
nothing like cherries. It tastes
like cherry flavor. Yeah. Yeah.

29
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:39,860
It was just a specific thing like
gray, gray drink, grape drink,

30
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:43,850
don't taste like grapes. It's
so good though. Yeah, it's
so good. I like the color.

31
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,720
Great. Well green juice, grape
juice tastes like grapes of course.

32
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:51,940
But grape drink actually a different
thing. I went to Dan to Davin,

33
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:54,210
he's the other day.
Have you seen those fountains?

34
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,950
So does that have the extra syrup
shots that yeah, the Americano. Yeah.

35
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,930
I went to Daphne's,

36
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:02,330
which is like this Greek place
and they just have like a regular,

37
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,420
you know like ice and then coke,
sprite thing,

38
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,640
but still chewing a stupid piece of shit.

39
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,730
And not try and get rid of it right now.

40
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:14,330
It's like they have extra shots where
you can add like you can have your diet

41
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:17,500
coke and you're like, oh, I think I
want some grape in orange jumpsuits,

42
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,020
grape flavored caffeine,
free coke, zero, uh,

43
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,140
Orange Cherry flavor, caffeine,
everything with anything.

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,210
I was watching one of those
episodes have no reservation.

45
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:30,020
I think there were in Chicago and they
were eating that some crazy hot dog type

46
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:34,430
place. It was like they have like meat
inside, like wrapped in some other thing.

47
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:38,270
There was, I don't know what the fuck it
was. It's in a bond and anyway, they uh,

48
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,090
they had a suicide run there
would deal with a soda.

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,790
They would just hit every
single stop along the way.

50
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,740
Like a little bit of sprite
and a little bit of root beer,

51
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:46,760
a little bit of dog coke,

52
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:50,150
a little bit of Dr Pepper and
just fill it up like gross.

53
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,040
It's disgusting that
it's like the mixture.

54
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,990
You don't know what you're getting less.
It's Mr Misty,

55
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:58,400
which I agree with Mr Misty suicides,
but it was this to misty suicide.

56
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,720
Mr Missy from dairy queen is
totally legit. Really? Yeah.

57
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,800
Try it out sometime. But when
it's winter, misty suicide,

58
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,260
Mr Misty suicides and if
you get it with the cream,

59
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,450
whatever it's called and
[inaudible] are there,

60
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,290
how many different flavors to Derek rose?
I Dunno. Supposed to must be used to be.

61
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,990
I mean when I was a kid it used
to be on the like you know,

62
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,300
12 different kinds or the
whole run of them. Yeah.

63
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:22,420
Cause it tastes like a fruit punch and
it was sloshy and they'd get the ice

64
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:24,430
cream in it and it kind of
tastes like a dairy queen.

65
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:28,320
Serve Mr mysteries are not like
coke and sprite. No, no, no it,

66
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,260
Mr Misty is a one of their drinks,
which is like a bunch of slushed ice.

67
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:37,160
Like an like a slush ice.
Like a nice, a nice, yeah.

68
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,250
Wow. Check it out. I will. Just a weird,

69
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,640
that shit feels so good
to us when we first eat.

70
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,520
It's so bad for your body when
you're eating like a slushie,

71
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,230
you're just drinking sugar syrup.
That's blue for some fucking reason.

72
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:53,500
Like you needed to be blue to
have that extra special kick.

73
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:56,080
You know you want a visual kick
as well as like a taste bud kick.

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,210
It doesn't taste like anything in nature.
Just takes another reason why. Shit.

75
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,820
That's another reason why God's an
asshole. You're like, you made us love it.

76
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,290
It's nature as horrible stuff you made
us. Our bodies react so well to it. Yeah.

77
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,750
It's so weird. It's not supposed to
be there the way it's supposed to

78
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,860
be. As fruit. It's supposed to be
processed in its natural form by the body.

79
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:14,311
You eat it,

80
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:18,870
you chew it not broken down to some high
fructose corn Syrup Shit and you know

81
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:21,000
where your body like is it like,
what is this this?

82
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:23,190
I'm thinking there's some
minerals in this. There must be.

83
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:25,440
It's like you know when
your body Taissa an orange,

84
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:28,470
that orange tastes delicious
because it's really good for you.

85
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:30,420
It's one of those things.
It's a natural thing.

86
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,470
We have created shift that tastes really
good but is not really good for you,

87
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,180
which it doesn't even exist in nature.

88
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,810
What would our red meat have? Red
Meat, red meats. Awesome. Oh cool.

89
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,843
I'll be willing to take that.

90
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,700
What I'd love for other road be more
excited before you all the fat and stuff.

91
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,310
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

92
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,380
You know what's terrible? Eating
red meat and no, not exercising.

93
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,990
When you eat red meat and you exercise,
it's not bad.

94
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:56,110
Especially if you're eating good meat,
like organic meat. Hopefully grass fed.

95
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,590
You know most folks,
if you get me for real,

96
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,170
that's how you're supposed to do it
and what they serve in and out at all.

97
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:02,460
They don't serve it anywhere,
man.

98
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,400
Even if you go to a nice place
that's a really good butcher shop.

99
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:09,330
That nice steaks. The ones with all the
marbling or the grain fed ones, what's it?

100
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,040
Why does, why does it change their meat
to productive or not productive as fuck?

101
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,120
That's what it does.
See,

102
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:18,810
they're not supposed to be eating
grain cows in the wild eat grass.

103
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,200
They roam around the eat grass,
but when we pen them up,

104
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:26,150
we forced them to eat corn because it
makes them fatter and that fat or make

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,840
some more delicious. That's why a Ribeye
is the shits on. Oh, it's all good.

106
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,080
When you get a eye,
if you knew what the fuck you're doing,

107
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,760
you get that lump charcoal,
lay that shit down.

108
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,550
You don't use it too much lighter fluid
just to touch just enough to get the

109
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,780
paper light under the, the,
the one of those, you know,
those things, those um, um,

110
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,980
they're like chimneys,
little fireplace chimneys and then yeah.

111
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,530
Oh yeah. They could tell it got one
of those fish shit go on so fast.

112
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,730
Oh, it's awesome. 20 minutes.
You've got full white hot coals.

113
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,960
You dump that shit out.

114
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,130
Make sure you got the ride distance
between the grill and the time.

115
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:02,000
That should correctly trial and error.
Get it right. Huh? That chimney is great.

116
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:05,620
It lights all the Coles at once. Yeah.
Rib Eyes are fucking have to buy new car.

117
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,600
It's like 25 bucks as a side thing that
you hold and you just dump out all these

118
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,180
hot coals and cows are not supposed
to taste as good as a ribeye.

119
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:15,350
We fucked them to make them taste that
good because it's all that fat in it when

120
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:19,760
you cook it and all that fat mixes
with all that meat and oh God damn,

121
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:22,460
it's delicious. And it's not
supposed to be that delicious.

122
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,770
I get grass fed rib eyes, man, and
they're not nearly as delicious.

123
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,020
They're not good.
I mean there's a,

124
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,840
it's a different sort of a thing and
you get a sort of a bit of satisfaction

125
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:32,630
knowing that this animal lived a natural,
healthy life.

126
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,160
And I think that's the right way to do it.

127
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,940
And I think if I had to choose between
having delicious steaks are having pretty

128
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:40,130
fucking delicious steaks
but not as delicious,

129
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,220
but I don't have to think about this
animal being forced to eat something

130
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:44,570
unnatural,
I'll go that way.

131
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,190
So I buy grass fed just to have a clearer
conscience when it comes to how my

132
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:54,110
animals are murdered for their murdered,
who sounds ridiculous and very critical.

133
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,850
It sounds ridiculous and
hypocritical, but I there, you know,

134
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,030
I'd prefer that they'd be grass fed,
but God damn,

135
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:00,050
it tastes awesome when they're not.

136
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,241
Yeah.

137
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:03,780
But what if these grass fed ones are just
like fucking like the farmers are just

138
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:07,080
completely assholes to them.
Like they get slapped all day long.

139
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,900
Cow Cow.
It's more difficult to grasp feed them.

140
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:17,580
So I don't think that that, that
would be the case. It's more costly.

141
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,500
Your yields aren't as big.

142
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,710
I mean those hippies probably don't get
laid that are probably fucking all these

143
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:23,371
cows.
So you were,

144
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:27,540
you're probably eating cows that had been
fucked in the ass by hippie vegetarian

145
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:32,130
farmers that what they're doing
being vegans and fucking car

146
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,250
parks. This is probably
someone who's fucked a cow,
right? Yeah, for sure. Right.

147
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,970
It's gotta be,
you've seen those videos from the um,

148
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,190
on the Internet about
the Colombian problem.

149
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:47,220
Like there's a lot of dudes in the
mountains, the fuck donkeys disgusting it.

150
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,110
We talk about testing that you have to
have her do that to make it a problem.

151
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,950
But there's a lot, a lot of them are
doing it. They had those guys from um, uh,

152
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,640
what, what does that, uh, that went
to website again? Shit, vice squad,

Dot. TV is the yard. Anyway,

155
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,070
these guys are awesome and they do all
these fucking crazy documentaries about

156
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:14,740
going to all these really
different fucked up locations.

157
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,100
They're fucking donkeys and
then we'll go to Columbia. Yeah.

158
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,160
It was normal for kids to first test out
sex on donkeys in this town before they

159
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:25,140
have families. Like people all
knew about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

160
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:27,120
He's fucking a donkey now.
You know, he's getting,

161
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,140

162
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,970
Like a pussy.

163
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,810
Could you imagine if it was all a troll
and that was a really brilliant sketch

164
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:40,590
that they lived together completely and
totally. Colombians are going, Holy Shit,

165
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,130
Huggies dude.
What if B Vbs TV,

166
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,350
the whole thing was like owned by the
green onion or something like that.

167
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:49,110
And this is all bullshit to
say, hey man, even if they,

168
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,620
if they are just what they've uncovered,
that really is

169
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,040
real VBS. Dot. TV is brilliant man.
Those vice to travel, the one on

170

look at the world, man. It is
terrifying stuff. And they,

171
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:03,100
they've, they've done a
bunch of brilliant one man's,

172
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,390
if they had guys going to
the jungle and do an Iowasca,

173
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,200
we've had guys going to Liberia,
they've got guys going to North Korea.

174
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,020
Just see what,
what it's like in those places.

175
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:16,020
You fucking scan it and see what
going on. Yeah. The real story.

176
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:19,590
They go to Thailand and hanging out with
ladyboys guys like hanging out in his

177
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:21,190
hotel room with a bunch of lady boys.

178
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,200
This guy climbed into a
tub this bad motherfucker.

179
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,350
I wish I knew his name cause I'm, I'm,
I'm pissed now that I don't know his name,

180
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,060
but this bad motherfucker climbed into
a tub with a bunch of lady boys. Really?

181
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,120
Yeah. He's afraid he didn't give a fuck.
He did it on the Internet. I love him.

182
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,990
I need to find out all the
internet stuff. Yeah. Wow.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,860
See a spots is enough to pay
for those trips and things.
Yeah. Wow. That's amazing.

184
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,190
I don't know who pays for it. Um,
but it was fucking incredible.

185
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:50,370
It just goes to North Korea just goes
different places and it just says fuck it.

186
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:51,204
I'll just grab it

187
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:51,771
guys.

188
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:55,900
I watched short circuit last night and
short circuit to remember that movie in

189
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,830
the 80s about a robot that
was like Ang Johnny, I

190
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,090
need input. And he like takes a
book and he reads through it like,

191
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,600
like really fast and it goes next book
that's done out of my mind at south by

192
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:11,270
southwest was here.
Isn't it hilarious?

193
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:13,850
Like there's one point where it goes out
in the cities like looking at all this

194
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:17,390
shit and he goes, look at all
this inputs, megabytes of input.

195
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,650
Here's the funniest part.
Here's the funniest part.
You know the Indian guy? Yes.

196
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,880
Good young American white person.
I know that's something Fisher.

197
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,080
I know that's how much Indians
were mocked in like 85 yeah,

198
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:31,130
you want to do it that long ago.

199
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,680
All the only jokes were
just that he had an accent.

200
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,130
And what's really creepy if
you watch short circuit too,

201
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,050
is that it's one of those movies where
like the main characters aren't even in

202
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:41,560
it. You know, cause they're like,
fuck, I'm not making a sequel.

203
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,610
And so like they was horrible and they
filmed it in Toronto but the whole movie

204
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:47,680
looked like it was a neat,

205
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,380
it was supposed to be New York City so
it was like all gray skies and really

206
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:52,340
small buildings.

207
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:56,150
And then there's like guy wearing a
New York hat and it looks so fake.

208
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,140
It was like to fake cause looking
New York, New York Yankees.

209
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,360
It was hilarious. But I, yeah
it's outdated as fuck so much.

210
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:08,750
But they need to Redo that movie but
make like make it r rated and make like

211
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,810
Michael Bay or something that attached
to it and make it a transformer maybe.

212
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,670
Cause that that had some funny shit in it.

213
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,090
Transformers.
It was a really good movie that goes.

214
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,470
Some people find that guys name. No, I
can't find it. I'm, I'm on the website.

215
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,820
I just don't want to
keep looking and just,

216
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,130
I dunno what the fuck you guys just
talked about for flavor song circuit. No,

217
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:30,680
I totally tuned out because I was trying
to find this dude's name cause he's

218
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:34,550
such a bad motherfucker. I apologize to
you sir. I will. I will find out. I don't,

219
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,550
I don't like Google in the middle
of a podcast. It's very distracting,

220
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,190
but I just did it just because this
guy is such a bad mother fucker.

221
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:42,260
I wanted to give him his propers.

222
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,230
What does it have to do with
getting me some of those?

223
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,830
How many bears back? Oh, you dog.

224
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,030
Ari's diet is hilarious.
So bad.

225
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,070
How do I stay in shape possible?
It's

226
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,810
not fair,
Bro.

227
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,800
Fucking eating a chopped salad with my
fork dipping and ranch the other day and

228
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:00,101
I'm like,

229
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:04,000
he's eating gummy bears are the people
who are aggressive about you not eating

230
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:04,840
certain things.

231
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,320
You know like people who like get a
actually angry at you if you're eating

232
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:11,260
shitty food, like, oh my God,
do you even know what's in that?

233
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,570
If you're eating a hot dog or something
and they'll fuck with you like that

234
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,850
because people are dying all over
constantly from these hot dogs,

235
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,790
this crazy cancer causing
things relax a little bit.

236
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,730
Definitely ain't good for it. You mean
you shouldn't be eating them all the time,

237
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:27,740
but if you want to eat them, if
you can't appreciate it, a hot dog,

238
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,030
you're missing out on a
lot of shit hooker. This,

239
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,420
you're missing out a lot of shit.

240
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,170
He can't just be all vegetables and you
know this a certain time when you have

241
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,730
to say fuck it and go old school and get
a dirty water hot dog on the corner in

242
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:40,564
New York City.

243
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,810
And then we've got a moist bond and they
slap some sauerkraut on that bitch and

244
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:46,840
some brown mustard Sha Zam
you don't know this dude.

245
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:51,190
This dude is probably a fucking terrorist,
you know, just take a lot of vitamin C.

246
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,280
This is probably like a scam,
this thing open. But there's, uh,

247
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,140
some of them are really cool. I
shouldn't say that. Terrorist.

248
00:12:58,141 --> 00:13:00,730
They're really nice guys. There's
one guy, he's got a falafel thing.

249
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,940
It's near a where Sussman has his office.

250
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,660
Remember when we went there with Tom
Jr got damn right near where all in ar.

251
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,820
God Damn, this guy's got some good food.
Fucking hot sauce. Legitimately. Ah,

252
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,090
Oh yeah, I remember it right and
you can't tell me not to eat that.

253
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:17,390
You can go fuck yourself.
Yeah,

254
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,520
it's two o'clock in the morning and you
know we just got done drinking and been

255
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:24,760
playing pool and drinking beer
and I'm eating that stupid.

256
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,780
Shut your mouth cops some vegetables in
the morning, but I'm going to be fine.

257
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,290
Okay? I've got good constitution.
I come from peasant jeans.

258
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,070
I can eat this hot dog. If you get killed
by a hot dog, you're a fucking pussy.

259
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,320
I'm not going to eat vegetables
in the morning, but I'll be fine.

260
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,430
I just wished there would only make,
they would have hot dogs.

261
00:13:41,431 --> 00:13:44,980
You get by the costs a little more and
we're only made with douchebag cows.

262
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,010
They would show you videos here. He's
being a Dick Right here. I look at him.

263
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,590
He steps on the baby cow.
What a fucking asshole.

264
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,900
He's stealing the food from everybody.

265
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:55,930
Knocks everybody out of the way because
he pissed on that little baby kap.

266
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:59,200
Did you see him do that? Fuck
this cow. Now here he is.

267
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:03,040
Here he is in in Strip
loin. You have your, uh,

268
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,510
your ribeye biting thing? Yeah.
It's just some shit that account,

269
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,493
if you can prove it,

270
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,640
you can document from the moment he gets
shot in the head to the moment he's on

271
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:16,000
your plate. Like, yeah, fuck you cow.
If you're asked by FDA, get involved,

272
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,660
get involved in this. Let's
go with, I will pay 25% more.

273
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:23,440
If I know that my cow was a Douche bag,
I will feel slightly better.

274
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,660
But then again, you've got to
think why was he a Douche bag man?

275
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,290
He's living in a prison system. Okay.
It's two courses. A douchebag cow.

276
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,860
He's being unfairly treated.
Oh,

277
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,790
that's not recommend art can argue
the other side. Yes, please. Well,

278
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,560
why aren't the other counselor specs they
are they just too stupid to act on it

279
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:42,280
and this guy's the fucking release it.
Indiana Jones. He's the neo in the matrix.

280
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,110
He's the one who rallies
against the system.

281
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:46,680
He's not a Douche bag where the
Douche bags. How about that? Ari,

282
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,560
you want to Jack in a box like a two
o'clock in the morning are feeding the

283
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,520
beast.
You're imprisoning

284
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,510
these poor cows.

285
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,880
Get some crazy lady on stage last night
showing her badge and stuff. Nice.

286
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,850
Let's not say what club because we
don't want anybody to stop doing that.

287
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:04,820
That's a good point. But uh,
afterwards these two girls,

288
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,500
one comic and our Australian friend,

289
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,930
they were like trying to help the
girl and get her to the hospital.

290
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,630
And it was like, she
was like, I just can't,

291
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,510
Australia should look down on everybody.
She was like, I just can't look away.

292
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:16,800
I'm going to care so I have to get
her some help. It was like, that's,

293
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,430
that's total it out. You know, I
don't care so I won't get any help.

294
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,950
And then she goes, yeah, it's
better than what you're doing.

295
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:24,380
Just laughing and taking pictures.
And I'm like,

296
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,780
don't think you're better than me.
First of all isn't taking pictures.

297
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,090
I was laughing though,
but I just don't give a fuck.

298
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,030
There's thousands of those people
across the city. It's unfortunate,

299
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:35,000
but some of it is funny, especially
if you're in the right state of mind,

300
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,290
you know? Especially if you
can prove again that this girl,

301
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,640
we were trying to get her off stage
and she took out a wet nap. Whoa.

302
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,750
Put it upside up inside of her
vagina. Whoa. Is that good for him?

303
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:48,030
Put it in her mouth. No, I don't
think if I can find it for you.

304
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,790
It's like putting it in your mouth.

305
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,400
That's like taking a wet nap and
putting it in your mouth. Right?

306
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:54,540
Doesn't that your body
absorb all the chemicals?

307
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,160
She put it in her mouth after it. The
Vagina. So either way. Either way. Yeah.

308
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:01,160
That bitch is toxic.
She's circulating her own toxicity,

309
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:06,550
vaginal to mouth in a big
tornado of herpes and aids
because she was so directly

310
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,840
mount moist white boy.

311
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,780
She's like that snake that swells. It's
tailed at Eddie had on a shirt yesterday.

312
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,180
That's what she was, man.
Sorry, were you say I lost it.

313
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,070
I just remembered that
if I was really rich,

314
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:26,960
I would buy the gold plated short circuit.
Short answer. That would be like, dude,

315
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,280
I don't have any nobody.
Then you're,

316
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,790
you're talking about what is
short term five came to life.

317
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,650
I remember in the Eighties
Dodge that bullet,

318
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,570
Steve 22 that instead of like 14 yeah,
I was fighting for survival.

319
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:41,630
Then it was time to feed myself
and it's pretty children.

320
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,470
It's terrible movie and so racist,

321
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,330
really short circuit is racing about race.
The fact that he has an accent.

322
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,120
I know, but it's not even an
Indian guy that's doing it.

323
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:56,050
It's a white guy that they
darken up. He, he was like, oh,

324
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,140
this woman at that one part. If number
two guys, hey, so where's your factory?

325
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:01,760
Where do you live? And you go, oh, I,

326
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:06,761
I live in my van and it looks like a
suicide bomber van right in front of the

327
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:11,720
shit. It's the lace is Steve
Gutenberg. Yeah, that was a good bird.

328
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,593
Remember the vehicle?

329
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,860
Gutenberg is a strange cat man.
I've told his story before.

330
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,980
I've told his story about when Phil
Hartman died. What happened to him?

331
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,150
It was very strange.

332
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:26,800
Steve Gutenberg dressed up in a suit and
went to Phil Hartman's house and stood

333
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:29,200
in front of the house
and act as if act as if,

334
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:34,201
and he was in an artist's representative
to the media and that he was asking to

335
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,010
please treat this with respect and,
but it was so clear.

336
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,050
Exactly. It seems, it just, it seemed
like he was doing it to become relevant.

337
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:47,560
Like people fell out. People
felt like it was a move. It was.

338
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,360
It was really weird and I've thought
about it, I'm like, look man,

339
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,570
I think a lot of actors border on the
brink of losing their fucking mind all the

340
00:17:57,391 --> 00:18:01,110
time. They're just keeping it
together, but as they get older,

341
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,710
their grip on together much like
Mel Gibson, Mel Gibson didn't just,

342
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:09,480
do you think he just became crazy.
He had to be crazy when he was young too.

343
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,130
He was just keeping it together.

344
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,470
He was just keeping it as also you allow
yourself because no one tells me no.

345
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,070
Everything just gets worse and
worse and worse. Way Worse.

346
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,570
It becomes what you can completely
lose track of who the fuck you are.

347
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,280
If you become some kind of a king like
superstar Mel Gibson type character,

348
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:30,870
I mean Mel Gibson made some ungodly
amount of money on that fucking religious

349
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:34,320
movie. Some insane. Any builders
thought he was a black belt in karate.

350
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,400
It's not a new thing. It's like if you're
a star and everybody's telling you yes,

351
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,670
he lives at grip. Yeah, you
could completely lose a grip.

352
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,830
I think a lot of actors
though in particular,

353
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:48,390
because acting is such a
weird and emotionally draining
occupations related to

354
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:49,620
age,
it's going to go away.

355
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,380
Especially if you want to be
that Megan Fox type character.

356
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,050
You've got a couple of years of
that hook or good luck, you know,

357
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,280
that's a grind and the girl,

358
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:59,820
the few girls that if Cameron Diaz is
that make it like decades later, like wow,

359
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:01,380
more power to you.
You know,

360
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:04,680
she's obviously a badass bitch
if she's able to pull that off.

361
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,220
But for a lot of them it does a short
ride or they say the first line or a

362
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:11,790
wrinkle and look go, oh well not only
that man, the whole idea of auditioning.

363
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,410
It's so bizarre.

364
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,660
The one of the weirdest
things about acting is that
to get a role where you act,

365
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:19,500
you have to prove,

366
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:24,501
you can act in a situation that's way
more stressful and bizarre and your actual

367
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:28,530
job. It's a little demeaning. It's a
little harder, like flaky after awhile.

368
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,760
Once you have the Gig man and you know
the words, then it's an easy thing.

369
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,390
Then it's just running over it.
You run it.

370
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,500
We would run our lines together and
then you would go into it and I'm,

371
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,400
and then they aren't thinking becomes
really easy and I'm talking obviously like

372
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:44,340
Sitcom acting, which is only shit and
they get to know your character too.

373
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,180
But I want to just say, I mean it's
not like Gary Oldman type, you know?

374
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,710
You know like what's his name from,
but no,

375
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:52,470
even with those guys drink your milkshake
Daniel Day Lewis that those guys

376
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:56,100
auditioning is a different art then. I
don't think they have to do that anymore.

377
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,520
I don't think anybody auditions.
Daniel Day Lewis, if you do you,

378
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:03,480
someone should kick you in the balls. How
dare you. Just that guy's body of work.

379
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:06,930
If there's any ever an actor whose
body of work just speaks for it,

380
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:09,570
just to let them do whatever the
fuck he wants to do. It's that guy.

381
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,720
Everything he's done, man, that
movie where he played a boxer,

382
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,170
if you ever watch that movie, I've never
watched any day. Now Daniel Taylor,

383
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,960
he is without a doubt the baddest
motherfucker who has ever acted for sure.

384
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,170
He's so fucking good.
He's so good.

385
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,000
He's not just a different person, but
you, you buy it, hook, line and sinker.

386
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,370
There's never a fake moment.
Watch that movie.

387
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:35,910
Gangs of New York when he plays that
crazy. What does it build? A butcher?

388
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,770
He plays that savage guy was fucking
people up with meat. Cleavers Dude,

389
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,220
you buy that shit 1000% yeah,
he plays insane.

390
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:47,800
So close to being insane
that it makes you nervous.

391
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,040
Like he might lose his fucking mind
and kill somebody in a movie because he

392
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,310
really falls so far and it was character.
But I think about this, that guy,

393
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:55,144
when he started,

394
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,860
he had to read two pages of something
and decide how with no idea who the

395
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:03,820
characters are and what the time period
during the conference room in front of

396
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,510
like some video camera and some p
at you like you're reading with a PA

397
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,150
oftentimes,
and the person is not an actor at all,

398
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,680
so their words sounds so artificial
and false. They'll like, tell me Ari,

399
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,140
if this is what you really want to do,

400
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,180
will you be me when you don't want to do
this anymore? And you're like, oh my God,

401
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,230
I have to pretend this is real.

402
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,120
Like you're supposed to be crying and
yelling at me. You sold last month.

403
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,790
That was a bad mother fucker in that too.

404
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,060
He's a bad mother fucker and everything.
Dude, that movie where he's a boxer,

405
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:34,090
he's literally the new world. No,
no, no. It was a long time ago.

406
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,340
He used to play at an Irish guy who's
like went to jail and became a boxer,

407
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,200
but he was like a legit boxer.
If you watched him in that movie,

408
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,730
he looked like a real boxer. Like there's
guys that play like, like Mark Walberg.

409
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:48,940
I'm sure he probably really does know how
to box. I mean everybody says he does,

410
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,850
but when you watch him in that
movie, the fighter, you're like,

411
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:56,170
this doesn't seem like a real fight to me.
This seems like a boxing movie,

412
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:59,470
boxing scene. It doesn't look real to
me. Whereas I'm watching Daniel Day,

413
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:03,610
Lewis and his hands are in
perfect position. The way
he gets hit, it looks real.

414
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:07,870
He's moving correctly. He's boxing
man. He's the waste throwing punches.

415
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,540
He's throwing punches exactly
the way you're supposed to do it.

416
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,690
There's no holes in his technique.
His technique is picture perfect,

417
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,670
which is better than
most professional boxers.

418
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:18,370
A lot of boxers have hitches and their
technique and they get away with it.

419
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,320
Like Roy Jones Jr always
had terrible technique,

420
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:22,630
but he was so athletic and
his timing was so brilliant.

421
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,300
He could get away with putting his
hands down real low and that's why he's

422
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:29,770
getting fucked up now. Yeah, he's getting
fucked up now because he had all these,

423
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,270
these skills that were based,

424
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:34,030
they were like reflex based
when he was really fast,

425
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:36,670
like faster than anybody by far.
And he was,

426
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:41,770
he had his technique was not correct but
he was so effective at it that he could

427
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:46,030
get away with it. He's was so powerful
in his, his punches were so fast.

428
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,090
He caught guys with things that they never
saw coming and he was able to do that

429
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:50,080
for the longest time.

430
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,580
But it was all based on him being able
to cover great distance. Like real fast.

431
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,250
And what soon as you got to hold
that shit went away man. Wow.

432
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,370
And then just left himself open. Yeah.
That's what's up. That's what happens.

433
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:05,180
[inaudible] it's what other movies
was in cause I really want to see it.

434
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,510
No, no Daniel Day later.
But the big, big one,

435
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:13,330
there will be blood or look them in the,
I say I haven't seen any of these.

436
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:16,450
I'm just, I wonder if I have something
against him cause I had to have to,

437
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,410
you have to see his movies. I loved
there will be blood. I loved it, man.

438
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,910
I loved it. I thought that
would be brilliant. I thought
it was, it was intense,

439
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:26,200
man. He's just, he was,

440
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,190
he so believable and believable is that
guy that was a complicated guy that that

441
00:23:31,191 --> 00:23:33,100
was all kinds of fucked up.
You know,

442
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:37,410
the way he took in that kid and yeah,
I don't want to,

443
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,630
I don't want to feed you anything, but
you need to see that. No you don't.

444
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:42,120
You don't need which one's
the best one and wait,

445
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,840
when people tell me that that's the
latest one, I don't need to see it. Go for

446
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,440
it. So it was probably like a really good
acting scene. If you want to look up.

447
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,550
That makes me not want to see a movie.
Especially if it's in subtitles. Oh,

448
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,380
you're got to. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God.

449
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,360
You haven't seen our launch Vaughn
dish though. I want to see that.

450
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,580
That dancing wine,

451
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,450
Portuguese cheesemakers it's brilliant
blocks. Water's amazing movie is it?

452
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,070
It's an amazing movie for any artists.
It's about performance.

453
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,710
Like a horrible,
you should watch that movie as a conduct.

454
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:15,710
You'll appreciate the same stuff that
strive for perfection in your art.

455
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,740
So one's in love.
Johnny Ma'am,

456
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,750
she love it. Natalie Portman. That
movie is just not good. Holy Shit.

457
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,020
Can you hear about Tracy Morgan?
Completely off subject,

458
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,810
but he got in trouble
again for saying retard,

459
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,960
but what he said was part of his act man.
I know you said that,

460
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,950
that he said retarded kids. Uh,
strong. They're like baby chimps.

461
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,820
It's funny man. It's funny shit. It's
a part of a character, but he's also,

462
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,310
he's also using to the
right. It might sense. Yeah,

463
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,890
but I mean it looked to say retarded kid.
Is there a better term than that?

464
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,451
There needs to be,

465
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:50,440
he needs to just fucking figure out if
he wants to do stand up or if you went to

466
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,360
a TV show because he's like
completely in the right,

467
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:56,750
but like he needs to really just say,
you know what, fuck this is my act.

468
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:59,620
But if he does that, then he
loses his TV show. You know?

469
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,630
It's just like you should
have to censor himself at all.

470
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:06,110
And I know you have to see what's what,
what the tone was,

471
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:10,730
what else was going on in
the room. There's something
to his act that satirical.

472
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,480
It's satire. It doesn't seem a
hundred percent real when he goes way,

473
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,580
way over the top like
that. I'm thinking, yeah,

474
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,600
I'm laughing because I know he's saying
the most ridiculous shit possible when

475
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,300
you know when, when he's talking
about, we're taught to kids.

476
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,700
John's like boob with chimps.
You know what he's doing?

477
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:28,790
He's trying to make people laugh
at how ridiculous he is. He's like,

478
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:30,770
he's trying to make people go
with this guy's a fucking great.

479
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,210
You have to get the tone was
earlier on the set. Look, dude,

480
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:37,790
I don't care what you say. That's
fucking funny. It is funny.

481
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,180
It's terrible that pill children
have down syndrome. It is horrible,

482
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,740
but it doesn't mean it's not funny.

483
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,580
When someone talks about a little down
syndrome, kids be strong like baby chimps.

484
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,790
Look, it's kind of funny. Over sensitive.

485
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,400
It's just everyone is just needs to
chill the fuck out. It's more like,

486
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,300
or they're not supposed to be
recalled. Retarded. You can,

487
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,110
you're not supposed to say retarded
anymore. I would say I'm retired.

488
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,130
You have different problems like down
syndrome and there was different,

489
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,780
it was different specs,

490
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:09,530
specific ailments that some of these
kids have and I appreciate that.

491
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,670
But you can't say that.

492
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:14,000
I can't use the word retarded because
retarded does not mean down syndrome.

493
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:19,010
They're retarded means you're
being a retard. You're being
slow, you're retarding.

494
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:23,750
It means slowing down. You cannot tell
me I can't tell someone they're slow.

495
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,460
Fuck you. I'm wicked. That's what
we're, then I feel tired today.

496
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,170
That doesn't,
it's like saying the word gay their side,

497
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,040
because you're using that
somebody, but you're not. Look,

498
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,380
there is something wrong with them.

499
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,200
It doesn't mean that it's not a terrible
thing that there's something wrong.

500
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:41,630
But how are you gonna pretend like
they're talking about us? All of us.

501
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,320
But let explain. I'm, let me explain. When

502
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,220
you talk about a friend, like I say,
Oh Ari, God, you're such a retard.

503
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,100
I don't mean you are a
kid with down syndrome.

504
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:55,170
I mean you're a step behind where you
should be. You go few were retarded.

505
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:57,720
You are slowed down.
That's what it means.

506
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,910
And if you call someone a
retard that's high school,

507
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,020
why don't we use the word retarded
was to say you're a retard.

508
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,973
Well there's that too.

509
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,850
I do think that that steak was retarded.

510
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,900
Do you think that's going to use it good?

511
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,750
Use It as good, like Oh my God. Yeah.

512
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:20,630
Avatar was fucking retarded changes.

513
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,790
Meaning isn't that funny how you,

514
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:24,580
I'd say retarded as being
really good all the time.

515
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,310
Like avatars is a perfect example.
I remember clearly saying, dude,

516
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:32,200
that movie is fucking retarded. It's so
good. It's so good. It's, it's insane.

517
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:36,010
And, and you know, you can't say
that. You can't use it that way.

518
00:27:36,011 --> 00:27:38,130
You can't use it at [inaudible].
I was so high. It was,

519
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:40,120
it's harder not to see this.
Here's my point.

520
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:44,600
I totally understand saying that you
shouldn't be making fun of, you know,

521
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,620
people who have an ailment but
completely removing a word that doesn't

522
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:52,870
necessarily mean that it's not
going to cure that ailment.

523
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,710
The real issue is the fact that there
are children who have to suffer with this

524
00:27:56,711 --> 00:27:58,060
terrible roll of the dice.

525
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,720
And that that is really a horrible
thing and we all feel that, man,

526
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,090
I've been around children that have
down syndrome. You're like, man,

527
00:28:04,091 --> 00:28:08,860
this is kids in this state where
he's never going to be like us ever.

528
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,160
He's going to be in this state and it's
a terrible roll of the dice for that kid

529
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,330
and it's very unfortunate,

530
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:17,410
but that doesn't mean that when your
friend trips and his beer flies and hit

531
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:20,260
someone in the head and you're
like, retard, okay, it's not,

532
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:24,220
it's not what that means.
You're not calling him someone
with down syndrome. We,

533
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,340
we have to acknowledge that
there's a bunch of different,

534
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,020
like when I say you're retarded dude,

535
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:33,070
I don't mean that you have down syndrome
and I remember when when that you

536
00:28:33,071 --> 00:28:35,330
spilled your beer,
it would be like you were totally booked.

537
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,640
That would go along with it. You're
clearly, it comes from that same place.

538
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,300
There's some of that there. You know I
used to do that bit about Noah's Ark.

539
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,420
If you tell the story to an
eight year old retarded boy,

540
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,720
he's going to have some questions.
I probably wouldn't do that bit today.

541
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,221
Yeah,

542
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:52,230
and when you would call your thought of
when you're calling your friends with

543
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,650
target, it was building a beer. You're
calling. I'm that guy. That character was

544
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,480
making fun of religion and were making
fun of the idea that tell you something's

545
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,610
insane story and you just buy it.

546
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,530
And then if you ask an
eight year old retarded kid,

547
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:06,630
he's going to have some
questions and that was the thing.

548
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,160
They sat down and sends it to neglect.

549
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,980
That's just complete [inaudible].

550
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,140
I apologize, but you don't
really mean that. I call my cat.

551
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,150
Probably should stop doing that.
Does that mean anything bad? Shoot.

552
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,690
You know what that means
on the only attention?

553
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:31,610
I think it's a funny sounding name,
but yeah.

554
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:33,590
How about if someone calls you
a girlfriend? A cunt balls?

555
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:35,990
I don't think that would be hilarious.

556
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:38,690
If somebody called my girlfriend a
cunt ball, I would laugh and giggle.

557
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,553
That's okay.

558
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,840
You should use the word negligent.
That's just me. Is that like a real word,

559
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:46,130
baby nigger? That's what your sense,
what you're saying. All right.

560
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,570
You better stop saying that. This is,
I'm going to be on NBC again. Dude,

561
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:54,180
you can't shop for me. You what if your
factory announced today? Oh, bad ass.

562
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,680
I can talk about it. Cause entertainment
we clean sweep. They broke the story.

563
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,010
Yeah, I had a fucking think
about it man. But ultimately,

564
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,540
ultimately arm a now is there
any change you couldn't,

565
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:10,660
I couldn't sit back and watch somebody
else do it. It would be bummed out.

566
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,140
I was watching on TV and you know David
Spade was hosting a fear factor but

567
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:19,090
dammit Mccartney show up in my car and
shit's going down. Is there any changes?

568
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,970
Is there any changes to the show at all?

569
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:26,750
It's going to be more awesome or awesome
or cause I'm fucking smarter now. Uh,

570
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,070
I think it's going to be pretty much the
same thing but high definition cameras,

571
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,990
the same total setup. Three stents.
There's going to be, the way do,

572
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,200
we're going to do eight of them, eight
episodes. We're going to do eight of them.

573
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,160
Two of them are going to be two hours.
So it's six regular ones and then two,

574
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:44,170
two hour on.
Are you going to make it interactive?

575
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,280
Are you going to have like a fear factor
application with behind the scenes

576
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,930
footage? Oh, I'm sure. Yeah.

577
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,070
Maybe you should get involved
with some of that shit son.

578
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,610
Are you going to do that? We could
probably make some money, dude.

579
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:58,000
Fuck some behind the scenes ringtone.
Let's make an APP.

580
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,260
So people contacted me because
I talked about this. Uh,

581
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,390
there's an APP for mixed martial
arts.com. It's fucking bad ass. And uh,

582
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,020
they asked me to check it
out and I checked it out and
I always try to help that

583
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,300
side out cause it's a really good site
and the people who run it are cool.

584
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,140
So I put a, I put it up on,
on Twitter and you know,

585
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:16,960
all these people checking it out and I got
it. I was like, God damn, I need an APP.

586
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:19,650
Like this thing is that shit probably
Kelly isn't, oh I need an APP.

587
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,170
I kind of went through Libsyn but that's
like adjust the podcast, right? Yeah.

588
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,180
What I need to come up with. So with all
the stuff that's just to the logs in it,

589
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,130
everything.
I want to have my blogs,

590
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:31,960
all those blogs that I
wrote years and years ago,

591
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,730
I wouldn't be able to update it.
So if you're bored,

592
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:36,520
you can read that shit on a train.
I said number one, I think there's,

593
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,150
there's millions of people that know
how to do apps now. Actually have it.

594
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,580
I know a company that that I'll get you
in touch with called the APP company

595
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:43,600
here in Santa Monica.

596
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,850
I should take my old blogs and read
them and make MP three files of them and

597
00:31:48,851 --> 00:31:53,530
make it available for download
for sale. Yes. No, no, no,
no. It just put it fucker.

598
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,220
You got to give people things.
Son is important. Trust me.

599
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:59,950
I know we're moving this bitch into a
studio. We have at least one a week.

600
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:00,521
We're going to,

601
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:03,910
we're going to put this place in a studio
now we're going to get some bad ass

602
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:08,800
space and so that guests don't feel
weird about coming over my house and plus

603
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,350
I'm tired of telling my daughters to
be quiet while we're doing the podcast.

604
00:32:11,351 --> 00:32:14,320
I think that's rude.
You know they have to hide.

605
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,450
They have to hide down there
when the podcast is going on.

606
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:20,380
So I'm thinking of getting some,
a bad ass space so we look legit.

607
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:23,080
So easier for people to get through to.
I'm sure it'll be not as far as those.

608
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,000
Yeah, this is tricky. And
plus we're going to be on,

609
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,360
we're not serious about going
harder to be the other way.

610
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,370
Not what you're going the other way.
No,

611
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:38,170
I'm going to go to Zuma beach please guys.
Come on up here.

612
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:40,070
It's a short half hour drive.
You want to leave yesterday?

613
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,030
How bad ass. What are you
talking about? Cause I got to

614
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,420
Joe, I'm asleep at the studio
and you know long day of work.

615
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,890
Find yourself like a gangster
when you said that there's some,

616
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,220
there's some fucking people
in Malibu that have I,

617
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,840
have you ever seen like those aerial view
photos of some of the houses in Malibu

618
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,230
that was like huge plunge. Johnny
Carson's a state up there and all these,

619
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:02,270
just some super,
super rich.

620
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:07,890
These GI to fucking yards in Malibu where
they have acres and acres of land on a

621
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:14,290
hilltop in Malibu. The SPEC
acular estates. It's like there's,

622
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,570
there must be some of the richest people
in the world by your taxes in that area.

623
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,480
Yeah. Fire targets for
sure. He lost his place.

624
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:24,110
A lot of people have red hot chili
peppers. Man, that's a danger zone.

625
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,810
I know some stuff.

626
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:28,430
I remember when we lived over there when
I lived in across the street from that

627
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:31,730
shit and we were like on the road
and my ex fiance was like, ah,

628
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,150
they're telling us we need to
evacuate the house. And I'm like, oh,

629
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,940
just grab my computer. And I'm like,
what the what? What else do I grab?

630
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,380
We have a cat say the technology evacuated
once and I've been evacuated twice

631
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,780
from, from fires, the fires. But Dude,

632
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:49,340
they're insane when you see it coming up
the fucking hill and you can't believe

633
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:53,060
that there's an attic control fire within
eyesight and there's helicopters are

634
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:55,240
constantly flying over and the
dropping water on it and you're like,

635
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,230
that thing's out of control. They can't
stop this. Yeah, you can smell it now.

636
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,940
Hollywood 20, 30 miles away. You could
smell this to ash. Dude, we went,

637
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,470
we had an episode of fear factor that we
shot and we shot it out a place where I

638
00:34:05,471 --> 00:34:09,940
think it's called Lake t Haun Tai,
I forget where it is. It's way out.

639
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,480
Way Up north. Right? It's like
an hour, hour plus away. Uh,

640
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,730
once you get on the highway. Yeah, I'm a
way up there on the way. So anyway, uh,

641
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,180
maybe, maybe it's an hour and a
half from the city, so maybe um,

642
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,580
we get there, it's like 10 o'clock in
the morning. We set up, we start filming.

643
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:30,470
We had to, we got the stunt done, but
we got to stunt done barely in time.

644
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:34,670
Now when I left,
the fire was in Santa Clarita,

645
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,980
which was over an hour driving by car.
Okay.

646
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,320
That's when I left my house. That's
where the fire was. When I came back,

647
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:45,290
when I was leaving, going
home, the fire was where I was.

648
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,420
It just spreads out,

649
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:52,100
spread an hour's driving
three or four hours.

650
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:56,140
It was going 2020 miles an hour,
probably spreading at 20 miles an hour

651
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,520
at 20 miles an hour. It had to be
because if I think about all the,

652
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,760
all the miles that it covered and it
covered them and only a couple hours,

653
00:35:04,761 --> 00:35:05,900
it was a really quick stunt.

654
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,510
Like a lot of times we have a stunt
and it's not that big of a deal.

655
00:35:08,511 --> 00:35:11,630
It only takes like a couple hours for the
first through last contestant to do it.

656
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,210
And this was one of those, cause I
remember we got out in, everybody's like,

657
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:15,920
we need to get the fuck outta here.

658
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,410
You could see it coming over the hill
and dude driving home. This isn't it.

659
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,260
This is what an hour for
one solid hour driving home,

660
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:28,460
going at a normal pace. 50 to 60 miles an
hour. Not Fast. No one was driving fast.

661
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,110
The entire right side from my passenger
window out the entire right side of the

662
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:37,510
world. It was on fire. That's crazy.
The road right there on the road.

663
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:38,040
The road on the

664
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,880
road. Yeah. Pitch on the road too. I
remember you posted on the road. Yes,

665
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:44,130
you could feel the heat, you can feel
the heat. If you roll down the window,

666
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:48,090
you could feel the fire. Okay. And
you could see ash falling everywhere,

667
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:51,900
like it was snowing and while we're
driving and we're just hoping that somehow

668
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:54,750
or another, this fire can't get us, but
it can't get you when you're on the road.

669
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,560
The only way can get you as if there's a
firestorm with a heavy wind and there's

670
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,500
literally tornadoes of fire.

671
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:04,020
So we're both like rip it across and
they could catch your car on fire.

672
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,340
And that is possible.

673
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,360
It is possible that that could happen if
there's enough fuel near the road that

674
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:10,560
it catches and runs to it.

675
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:13,110
It's like one of the reasons why
you're supposed to clear off the brush,

676
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,830
like near your house and around your house
so that it doesn't mean they probably

677
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:21,210
have rules for the road too. So for over
an hour we're driving and it's like,

678
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,100
it's like lord of the rings,
Bro.

679
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,940
What you remember when the fucking tower
came alive and all the goblins came out,

680
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,590
dude. Yeah, exactly. The eye. It's insane.
It's all fire. It doesn't seem real.

681
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:36,660
It seemed so artificial. And everyone
was driving around like slack. Jawed Oh,

682
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:40,100
and that's right. Some guy got hit by
a fucking car. I forgot about this.

683
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,420
He's not looking because he's looking
at, the guy died. Yeah, he died.

684
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:43,560
He got hit by a fucking car.

685
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,620
He's something happened to his car and
he tried to run across the highway and he

686
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,230
got nailed. And you've got
nail. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

687
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,170
How would it get away from
the fire? Something? Yeah.

688
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:55,620
I don't know the exact specifics of why
he was trying to run across the highway,

689
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:56,580
but he didn't make it.

690
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,020
And I believe one of the producers
of the show actually saw it happen.

691
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,260
It was like several cars ahead.
He actually saw the guy get hit,

692
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,570
he got out of his car and
try to run across. Yes.

693
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,600
He tried to run across the road and they,
you know,

694
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:13,970
and he got fucking crushed. It's
so terrifying. And then, you know,

695
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,730
so you see this thing where there's
cops and ambulances and everything and

696
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:18,451
they're, you know, they're,

697
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:20,340
they're tending to this guy and
you're trying to rubber neck.

698
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:21,720
And then after you get past that,

699
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:26,870
it's just like literally you're waiting
for demons on black horses to come

700
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:32,340
rolling over the top of the
mountain. Wow. Dude. It's insane.

701
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,240
And you can't stop it. You know, that
Shit's going on right now in Arizona.

702
00:37:36,241 --> 00:37:39,300
It's completely out of control or it
was at least a couple of days ago.

703
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:43,410
It's completely under control in San Diego
for the fires down there. Yeah, I did.

704
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:47,610
Yeah. Well, you know what happened? Um,
I was booked at a theater out there.

705
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:48,660
I forgot the name of the place.

706
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,290
So it would alternate between doing the
house of Blues and San Diego and this

707
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:55,710
other place, which was really cool. Yeah,
that's it. Yeah. Fourth and be right.

708
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:59,250
That's what it's called. That's what
it's called. Right. So, um, anyway, um,

709
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,170
white before I was
supposed to go down there,

710
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:04,260
the fires hit San Diego and
San Diego got fucked up.

711
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,510
So many people lost their houses.

712
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,500
So I didn't feel right about just going
in there and not giving them something

713
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:14,730
and not, not saying, hey, you know, you
guys just got fucked up. You know, I,

714
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:18,100
I want to send you some appreciation.
Give you some love. So I,

715
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:20,830
I gave them all the money that
I made. Like a concert. Yeah.

716
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:24,930
Give it all to the Red Cross. So it
was cool. So I felt good, you know,

717
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,460
and so like I to his point,

718
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,360
well it's like I did the show
cause I wanted to do the show,

719
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,200
not because anybody was, you know,
everybody who paid money, they didn't,

720
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:36,010
none of that shit went
to me, not a sin. It

721
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,890
all went to the Red Cross and it was,
it was fun.

722
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,360
And so that way that felt like I have
like a moral compass when it comes to shit

723
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:45,670
like that. And if I feel like, Ooh,

724
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:49,150
I'm pulling money out of this and this
is like a place that just got hit with

725
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:51,880
some natural disaster. Like I shouldn't
be pulling any money out of this area,

726
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:55,780
I should be giving that money right back.
Right. So, you know, it's, I feel like,

727
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,450
look,
these people lost everything.

728
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:03,250
At the very least I can lose my
salary for a show to help, you know,

729
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:07,330
just to say thank you.
This is important, man.

730
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:09,900
You have to go on those instincts.
Mpr there,

731
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,300
this study wants about giving and the
endorphins, it releases inside you.

732
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,160
You actually feel happy. Yeah.
Just like after sex, you know,

733
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,970
and after certain things, just chemically,
your body enjoys giving. Some people,

734
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:24,920
they say they don't. Some people
say, I fuck them, I'm from Fargo,

735
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,890
I'm out from me Bro.
And they'll laugh about it.

736
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
But I get that and that's
what the owl thinking it.

737
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:32,290
But the actual act of doing when
you do it helps you in some way.

738
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,890
It's not stronger to do that.
There's people that think
that it's stronger. I go,

739
00:39:35,891 --> 00:39:37,780
fuck, fuck everybody
else. I'm out from me.

740
00:39:37,781 --> 00:39:40,960
And then it's like this hard ass to
approach is pragmatic approach to life.

741
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,720
No one's going to fuck me over. I'm going
to fuck them over. Fuck you. But that,

742
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:49,750
that approach is really the weak persons
way out. It's really, you know, yes.

743
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:51,690
You're going to run into a
lot of douchebags in his life.

744
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,140
How about help each other. That's why
he took his son and Jen so long to um,

745
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,530
meet everybody else on the island.

746
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,323
Oh

747
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,860
Wow. Yeah, man. They made that Asian
girl. I have to be a dirty whore.

748
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:13,730
Demean her out there having an affair
on that. Nice man. You put your,

749
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,570
but it's okay. He drove her to it. Yeah.
He drove her to it. Yeah, he was. He was,

750
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:21,710
he was, he was a monster. I guess that's
how they was just trying to get by. Yeah.

751
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,230
He had to beat that guy.
He'd beat that guy off so that he'd be,

752
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:26,550
it became a bad guy now.

753
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,380
Yeah. Have you heard a theanine, theanine,

754
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,280
serene lift? Where? Laura here,
here's what you're talking about.

755
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:39,020
Is it a supplement? Yeah, it's, yeah,
it's a, a Dunkin turned me onto it.

756
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:43,790
It's AI thing. I think it's found in
green tea a lot really? But he says like,

757
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:47,530
you know, you take a couple of them and
spell it for the folks at home. All right.

758
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:51,650
UH, t h. E a. N. I n. E.

759
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,720
Next word is s. E r e n.
E. N. N with low Aurora,

760
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,750
R e l o. R. A. And what
is it supposed to do?

761
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,030
He says it's like a natural relaxer,

762
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,900
like it takes stress away and kind of
calms you down and stuff like that.

763
00:41:05,901 --> 00:41:08,060
And he's like,
I took three and I felt like I had,

764
00:41:08,061 --> 00:41:09,890
it was like on Vicodin
or something like that.

765
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,870
So I bought some and I took four
yesterday and it was, it was very nice.

766
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,850
Kind of like a chill,
relaxing kind of moot.

767
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,750
Do you want to Joey Diaz mode? Fucking
mama off the joint. You shut the fuck up.

768
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,990
What are you going to want?
Shit on amazon.com I go down a Cushman.

769
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:29,250
I stepped back, I gave him $40.
We say hi, I'm about my business.

770
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,820
You know you're doing with that fucking,
you buy on amazon.com

771
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,970
it would not work, Brian. It would
not work on him. Where's television

772
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,470
Brian?
But would,

773
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,230
what would it be like if you ever feel
irritable or anything like that with they

774
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:47,420
of that kind of like anxious
edge and stuff like that?

775
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,710
It seems like it'd be great for that.
Yeah.

776
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,410
I like some Endeca for that
because I had that, I had the, uh,

777
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:56,690
yesterday and the jeopardy Tosha, yeah.
Drop. Not all the time for me man.

778
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,560
Like sometimes it just amplifies that
shit. So you like to try this stuff now?

779
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,740
Yeah. Well I W I used it
yesterday or did use it, so yeah.

780
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,610
And it totally just took that away.
I had that question.

781
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:09,810
It's like kind of on the edge or two days
ago. I'm sorry, I have a question. So,

782
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,881
so dark.
He goes,

783
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:13,340
I took three of them felt like
biking or whatever and you're like,

784
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,750
I'm going straight for for,
well,

785
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:19,280
I did research on it and then on the
bottle it says recommended dose two.

786
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,880
And I'm like, well, I'm going to
do twice the recommended fuck that.

787
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,030
I'm not going to die,
die off green tea.

788
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:31,190
Do you want to try it and see what
drugs start low and then move up slowly?

789
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,350
It's not really a drug, right? Isn't it
a drug? No, it's not. It's like, well,

790
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,240
let's explain that then, because if it's
altering your mood, it's gotta be a drug.

791
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,770
Um, it's uh, it's not an illegal narcotic.

792
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:46,670
Holy Basil Leaf extract and I saw all
you're going to get fucked up on basil

793
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:51,290
where you're gonna die. Uh, be careful.

794
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,480
Can Be Amino acid.

795
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,580
L theanine I guess is what to support
one of those trees in my backyard. Yeah.

796
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:04,460
You know when you get a Mozzarella
Caprese Mozzarella, like the good stuff,

797
00:43:04,461 --> 00:43:07,880
especially that burrata stuff or
grotto that you get from Italy,

798
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:11,570
that real juicy Mozzarella and
then you have those beef steak,

799
00:43:11,571 --> 00:43:15,910
tomatoes and then they put basil on
it. I eat the basil to Bro. Really?

800
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,910
Cause that's how I roll.

801
00:43:16,911 --> 00:43:20,690
I don't give a fuck the law plucked that
Bazell off and they'll actually aside,

802
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,750
I eat the shit out of that base.
What about that little green thing?

803
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:28,520
I'm a savage show. Green. What's
that? Just trying to like a gorilla.

804
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:32,790
That's that green thing that sometime
they add that's the hawks dick that up

805
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:37,970
like garnish. Oh what is it like put
it on top of like an orange sometimes.

806
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,270
Yeah.
Or like Danny's parse.

807
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:43,790
It's like something like it's more
just for looks. It's not deal.

808
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:46,400
Looks like the leaves of a deal.
Just like it's like green.

809
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:49,640
It just makes it cheap. Diners
use it cheap. Diners do it.

810
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:53,730
When you buy like a blue fish,
you buy the grain thing

811
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,800
fucking clear. So you know we're
talking about what is that thing?

812
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:00,520
How do we not know the word for this?
This is a store in a word.

813
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:05,310
Is it really Italian garnish but I don't
know. Green Shit, not parsley. Parsley.

814
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,930
You sure? I'm not sure. Honestly.
I'm not sure. I don't know.

815
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,210
I always thought it was partially that
you throw on Shit when you want it to

816
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:13,670
look pretty. And Greg
is parsley. Well fancy.

817
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:17,330
I think that's more like fancy place
where we're talking about like old diner

818
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:20,140
where they have like that green thing and
not even edible. Like you're like, Ooh,

819
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,760
oh really? What is that?
It's just shitty person.

820
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,080
It's weird where there's some
shit that Chinese Kale, Kale,

821
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:32,030
Kale is the shit that
I make my, my, my lean

822
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,680
shakes out. It look it up. There's
no way it's Kale, Kale, bro.

823
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,460
Kale is like a lettuce. Stupid
idiot cow. Fuck it through a bit.

824
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,740
But I guess you could if
you went to a vegan place.

825
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:44,100
It's very possible that get sprinkled
Kale and your food if they really shredded

826
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:47,820
it, but it's pretty uncommon. That's
not what we're thinking. I know.

827
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:51,510
It's delicious though, man. They have
like a, like a dried Kale, like big,

828
00:44:51,511 --> 00:44:54,810
they make Kale chips. Oh yeah.
These are like Vegan Kale chips.

829
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:58,320
They're fucking delicious, man. There's
so good. It's hard to believe that.

830
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:01,970
They're like sort of like super
hippie, healthy. Oh yeah, man.

831
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,270
It tastes awesome there. There's not a
lot of bang for the volume. Whatever.

832
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,120
It's like light bags. Yeah,
like, well, you have a big bag,

833
00:45:09,121 --> 00:45:13,950
but they dissolve so quick in your
mouth. It's like, yeah, it's weird.

834
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,380
It's like as you eat it, it
dissolves really quick, but fuck.

835
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:17,310
They're delicious man.

836
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,270
And plus you get to feel really
good about the environment.

837
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:25,020
Why Kale? Man? I'm eating Kale.

838
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:29,100
I'm like helping when you eat kale. Kale
is like saying, I do yoga, really Kale.

839
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:32,430
I'm going to kill them into yoga. I'm into
Buddhism. Very spiritual. A lot of Kale.

840
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,450
Yeah. Construction workers
don't talk to you about Kale.

841
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,580
What are you eating for lunch,
Tommy? I got a Kale Salad.

842
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,080
Posters it up a little delicious,
Bro.

843
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:48,300
It's got organic coop
gumballs in this thing.

844
00:45:48,301 --> 00:45:51,450
Load it when you start calling a fear
factor there. Go the end of the month.

845
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:55,750
The end of this month. Yep. Bam. So out
this month, July, July. Are You Angela?

846
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,070
The party roles? Don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't. I can't it all job.

847
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:04,140
You want story storyteller
show in Montreal. Are you
doing one when fuck stories?

848
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:07,050
We're doing a four days.
All about sex club. Good.

849
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:09,720
Because you can mix in some
material on that. Yeah.

850
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:13,530
Well some of my stories that turn into
that, definitely. Yeah. I, when I do your,

851
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:14,490
your storytellers show,

852
00:46:14,491 --> 00:46:18,660
I just figured out what material did I
have that covers the subject and I just

853
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:22,290
do that.
I'll tell a little bit of a story.

854
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,500
I'll fuck around a little bit. It's like
this one time. Does that make it a story?

855
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:27,690
If I said I'm gonna go right into my bits,

856
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,710
I just feel like if I'm in front
of a large audience talking,

857
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:36,500
I'm way better when I'm just doing comedy.
What bill burr did last time. Yeah,

858
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:40,770
he did it also did a story that was a
from the podcast too. It was really,

859
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,060
really good at Ranson stuff. He's
hilarious man. He's a fucking monster.

860
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,180
He's one of those guys. There's, there's
a few of those guys out there that,

861
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:51,570
you know, I, I really enjoy going
to watch cause it gives me like, uh,

862
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,570
an inspirational creative.
Joel Chapelle was always like that.

863
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:57,090
Like I would see him and you know,
a Nick Depaulo.

864
00:46:57,091 --> 00:47:00,890
I saw him in New York and it gave
me like a big jolt want Norton.

865
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,610
When I saw Norton in Austin, he
gave me a big jolt. You know,

866
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,540
you see a guy who's really good,
you go, Ooh man, that was fun.

867
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:09,540
I want to go fucking right again and
going on stage right now. You know,

868
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:12,310
it makes you really excited about him.
It's where he's filter you up.

869
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:14,040
Cities when I was like, Ooh,
I want to go roll tonight.

870
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:18,330
Something you need to get back in
and dude, don't, don't, don't listen.

871
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,270
I can help you out, man. This
is what we're going to do.

872
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:23,940
We're going to get you on a weightlifting
program for a good solid six months

873
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,400
before we throw it in there.
Take us kettlebells. Kinda
fucked my knee up. Yeah,

874
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,780
because, well, you know what?

875
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:34,660
Now that have been working with Steven
Maximal exercise, Steve Maxwell,

876
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,060
world renowned fitness coach,

877
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:39,370
he straightened me out on a bunch of
different shit and how to do things

878
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:40,870
correctly.
He made like a,

879
00:47:40,871 --> 00:47:43,710
a bunch of little videos from me on my
iPhone like he would do the elaborate

880
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,550
technique. Yeah, it helps. It helps.

881
00:47:45,551 --> 00:47:48,340
Having somebody who study with the
Charles Atlas School of weightlifting.

882
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,190
Well we can do for you though, Dude. It
start you out with no weights at all.

883
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:55,780
I can, I can devise a really good
routine. That's all bodyweight shit.

884
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,410
All Body weight squats. You'd be amazed
at how hard bodyweight squats are there.

885
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:04,300
Easy for for three or four and then maybe
for 10 but when you get to 30 and 40

886
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:08,530
and 50 and you start doing
102 hundred know my dad is,

887
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,520
you know the guy who was the ms who's
the the wrestling champion now and I've

888
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:16,690
heard of WWE wrestling champion. He
was a contestant on fear factor. Yeah.

889
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:20,090
And even back then he had been on it so
he was, yeah, he was a reality show guy.

890
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This was he
on road rules. Piper's pit.

891
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:27,580
What was the reality show you get
whatever he was on. Cool asphalt,

892
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:29,640
the road rules, something like that.
Maybe it was a real world. I don't know.

893
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:32,110
Cool ass fucking guy. Very, very cool guy.

894
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:35,290
He and really impressive
athlete like dude,

895
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:38,290
he was the most impressive athlete
in the history of fear factor by far.

896
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,970
It was a stunt that they had to do.

897
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:44,440
We had a dive underwater and you had a
see like you had to like go through all

898
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:45,850
these things and get all these different,

899
00:48:45,851 --> 00:48:49,720
I think it was like flags like retrieved
flags and sugar water and no one came

900
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:52,690
close to what he could do.
He went and dove under,

901
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:54,760
held his breath for like
more than two minutes,

902
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:57,730
accomplish the whole thing
faster than anybody. He's like a,

903
00:48:57,731 --> 00:49:01,510
he's a freak athlete and what he would
do is bodyweight squats every day.

904
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:02,380
He would say that,

905
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:04,810
you know when he was learning how
to wrestle they would have them.

906
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:07,840
One of the conditioning things they did
is like Karl gotch is like this famous

907
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,560
wrestling conditioning guy and he would
advocate these bodyweight squats to,

908
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:15,820
they're called Hindu squats and
they do 500 of them every day. Dude,

909
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,600
you will have tree trunk legs
and without any weights at all.

910
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:22,480
You don't have to lift any weights.
Just straight pushups man.

911
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:26,290
We'll get you in some serious condition.
Yeah, I was the chip collect college.

912
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:28,780
I would do like just push
us before showers sit ups,

913
00:49:28,781 --> 00:49:32,350
push ups and push ups like yourself on
like a real routine where you're going to

914
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:36,010
do three sets of 53 sets of 50 pushups,

915
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,750
three t you're going to build up to it.

916
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:41,740
But this is going to be the eventual
routine. Three sets of 50 uh, you know,

917
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:46,300
depths three sets of 1500. If
I could even do it now, yeah,

918
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:47,170
you probably could,

919
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,740
but we want to build up to 50 where
you can really give yourself a couple

920
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,520
minutes break and get right back in there
and try to bang out 50 and if you've

921
00:49:53,521 --> 00:49:56,400
got to get on your knees for a couple
seconds and then dive back in just but

922
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,750
finish that fucking set first,
that set. And then dude,

923
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:02,350
you'd be an incredible shape.
You don't have to lift weights.

924
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,910
There's a bunch of guys who advocate just
all body weight exercises and there's

925
00:50:06,911 --> 00:50:08,020
a bunch of them on the Internet.

926
00:50:08,021 --> 00:50:09,940
I don't want to say their names because
I think some of them are crooks,

927
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:15,400
but there's some good enough ones that
you could find some shit online. And, and,

928
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,860
and, you know, without
paying anybody, you know,

929
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,130
when released these exercises as a
result of his time, you really shouldn't.

930
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,940
Everybody should be,
I totally believe in paying for a trainer,

931
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,010
but I also taught to believe if you're
doing some shit that everybody already

932
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:32,140
should know, like how to do a pushup,
you know, fucking put that online master,

933
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:34,430
keeping that shit to yourself.
It's a system, I guess,

934
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,530
that they're putting out over
those things. He's having parks.

935
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:40,520
We can do the exercise stations do. Those
are awesome. People used to do those.

936
00:50:40,521 --> 00:50:43,850
I think I did them once ever once ever.
I did it once when I was fighting.

937
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,920
I was like, well, he's always said
that this is what I'm gonna do.

938
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:49,040
I'm going to get in real good shape by
doing this every day before sparring and

939
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,590
I just go in to all my sit ups and
Chin ups and pushups and Brian,

940
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,020
just check the fuck out.

941
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:58,920
Notice that we started talking about
fitness and Brian's like done nap time.

942
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,790
I do that sometimes because you guys
talked about technology. I just like,

943
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,450
it's not even, I'll just, my mind wanders
to things that I have any idea. Look,

944
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:08,270
we completely lost Eddie yesterday.
Eddie told a story about,

945
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:12,590
it's a boy that he thought was his son
and he completely checked out to the best

946
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:17,210
of the blood. Gas and Ufo is man. Yeah,

947
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,950
fucked up.
That was the real story.

948
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:22,130
It was very sad and it was like I was
almost checked out of it, but I was like,

949
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:25,910
oh, I was just thinking about it. He's
got some shit that I knew this story.

950
00:51:25,911 --> 00:51:27,020
I knew the story already.

951
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:31,820
Obviously eddies one of my closest
people on this planet. But, uh,

952
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:35,420
yeah, I really think that in order
to be a guy like catty, you know,

953
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:38,540
in order to be like one of these
super creative weirdo types,

954
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,720
you almost have to have like a really
fucking completely just jacked life as a

955
00:51:45,621 --> 00:51:50,540
child, you know, in order to be
bro, all of us that have, you know,

956
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,340
the,
that I know that I hang out with,

957
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:56,900
all of us have come from some
fucking bizarro childhood situation,

958
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,670
like every single one of us where it's
almost like you have to have some shit

959
00:52:01,671 --> 00:52:05,600
parents every now and then in a
culture to jolt people out of the norm.

960
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,770
Definitely will. There's plenty of
people come out of those. But yeah,

961
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:12,710
there's a lot of people that come out
of that and they become Super Christian.

962
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,270
Yeah. A lot of people that come out of
Shitty childhoods and they, you know,

963
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,150
just fine. Yeah. They,

964
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,670
they've managed to deal with it or they
have a drink every night and try to

965
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:24,070
forget it. But, you know,
I think Alex on people,

966
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,420
but I think everyone that I
know that's really brilliant.

967
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:30,380
All my brilliant friends have like a
weird, some fucking nutty childhood.

968
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,950
What we're looking at me and like
bill burrs, like I don't know.

969
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,490
Well I know Bill Byrd was violence
with his brother and like talks,

970
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:40,350
he's got some great stories about it.
They did it. Your storytellers show. Yeah.

971
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,790
You know, and he's talking about
about how to shake their hands. Yeah.

972
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:45,430
I believe he's Irish.
You know,

973
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:49,340
the Irish in Boston are fucking
savages and that is just a fact.

974
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,460
And I don't think people can really
wrap their head around how nutty those

975
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:53,590
fucking people.
You know.

976
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,870
And I can say that cause that's where I
grew up and I'm one quarter Irish and I

977
00:52:56,871 --> 00:52:59,840
understand it 100% but they're
like a double negative of site.

978
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,310
It's a hard town son. And you
know, you grow up with your,

979
00:53:03,311 --> 00:53:05,720
your son and who knows what his,
you know, his dad was like that.

980
00:53:05,721 --> 00:53:07,700
These kids were getting away
with this behavior. You know,

981
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:08,750
who knows what the fuck was happening.

982
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:10,460
But it seems like the whole
family likes to argue.

983
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:12,680
That's why bill's birth
such a brilliant comedian.

984
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,550
Cause he became amazing at arguing when
he was the youngest guy in the smallest

985
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:18,410
guy. So he had to be
the quickest wit. Yeah,

986
00:53:18,411 --> 00:53:20,210
they do that are basketball
players whenever they're like,

987
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:23,450
I need to be forced to the dinner table.
I didn't get any food like up did.

988
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:23,991
He told,

989
00:53:23,991 --> 00:53:28,380
he told a brilliant story about the
first time he beat his brother in a fight

990
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,640
and then he felt his brother quit and
then it just killed him and he was like 35

991
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:34,950
or something and he was like,
Oh I shouldn't be beating you up.

992
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,190
You're my older brothers. I think. No, I
think it was younger when that happened.

993
00:53:38,191 --> 00:53:41,550
Then there was a fight when he was
older we grabbed onto it and held him.

994
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:42,920
He said he wasn't going to fight him.
He wasn't going to,

995
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:43,950
his brother was trying to find them,

996
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:46,830
but then his brother got winded cause he
was a suit. He was really a funny story.

997
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:51,090
I used to be five minutes, 50 seconds,
just no, we'd round twos and five minutes.

998
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,560
He's like sitting there holding his knee
and breathing but just still burns this

999
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:56,190
five minutes, you know, and look man,

1000
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,440
look how brilliant Pilbara
bill burrs you got to,

1001
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:02,790
you almost like have to go through
something to be that guy, you know,

1002
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:05,730
to be very few comics that
I know that I hang out with.

1003
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:10,140
Have parents that are together
or have any sort of like,

1004
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:15,360
well my mom and my Stepdad are actually
very happy and they've been happy since

1005
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:17,460
I was seven years old.
It's real weird.

1006
00:54:17,461 --> 00:54:21,880
All my damage shit came
from my real father and all
before you were seven? Yeah,

1007
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:24,210
before I was seven. That's all
the damaging shit. My father,

1008
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,650
my real father was crazy. He was like
a psychotic person. Really? Yeah.

1009
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,240
He was be beat the fuck out of him.

1010
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:33,580
Like he would be the type of come up
with the fuck out of my cousin. Yeah.

1011
00:54:33,581 --> 00:54:38,380
He'd beat my cousin up. He
picked my cousin. I'm buying
his hair dude drugs. Oh No,

1012
00:54:38,381 --> 00:54:40,860
no, no, no, no. My cousin had
done something. He had hurt.

1013
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:44,640
Somebody was playing hard and hurt
somebody and he was a bigger kid.

1014
00:54:44,641 --> 00:54:48,540
He was like 16, and my dad picked
him up by his fucking hair on,

1015
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:52,170
never forget the rue him and
he was a big guy, big scary,

1016
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,960
crazy cop from New Jersey.
Oh yeah.

1017
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:58,590
So that was all my shit from when I
was like really young. I got to see,

1018
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:01,740
I got to see worst case scenario,
someone who just can't keep it together,

1019
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:05,820
smacks women to shit out of kids,
uh, beats the shit out of them.

1020
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,330
So I got to see that really early. But
then my dad, my Stepdad is a hippie.

1021
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:12,600
My stepdad was a computer programmer,
computer programmer,

1022
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:13,890
and he was an architect.

1023
00:55:13,891 --> 00:55:16,620
He went to school for architecture after
he stopped doing computer programming.

1024
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,970
That's why we lived in San Francisco.
But that's weird.

1025
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,140
You're too well in a negative way,

1026
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:25,830
but it's like your dad's a Weirdo hippie
like that Kibo was raised by lesbians

1027
00:55:25,831 --> 00:55:26,300
and all that.

1028
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,830
Like people would make fun of me when I
went to school because my dad had long

1029
00:55:28,831 --> 00:55:31,710
hair. Yeah, yeah. He's my Stepdad.
His hair would go down to his ass.

1030
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:35,250
And I still wasn't accepting him as a
father because I was a little snotty cause

1031
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:38,990
I was seven years old and my dad was my
real dad and my real dad was in this bad

1032
00:55:38,991 --> 00:55:41,200
ass guy and know that you
didn't know any better.

1033
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:45,120
It was a stupid kid because my
father wanted me to be like him,

1034
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,021
so he would do shit.

1035
00:55:46,021 --> 00:55:49,940
Like one time I had a fight with
my cousin because I liked Godzilla.

1036
00:55:49,941 --> 00:55:54,450
He like King Kong, one of those fucking
things instead of going like great, great.

1037
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:57,650
I guess I like King Kong and he like
Godzilla and he wouldn't stop saying that

1038
00:55:57,651 --> 00:56:01,400
God's Zillow would fucking hung up. So it
turned into a fight somehow or another,

1039
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:05,610
you know, kids, kids are retarded, you
know, full Q when you're King Kong,

1040
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,660
we were sweating, you know, it got
broken up by someone's mom. And then, uh,

1041
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:14,250
you know, my, my dad pulled me aside and
just pull me in a room, shut the door.

1042
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,520
I'll never forget this because I
was five years old and he, you know,

1043
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:20,220
and there's a very few things that I
remember about him. This is one of them.

1044
00:56:20,221 --> 00:56:21,960
I remember what the dresser looked like.

1045
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:25,240
I remember what the fuck and the sheets
look like on the bed. And he goes,

1046
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:28,890
what happened? And I said, you
could not lie to him. There was no,

1047
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,930
there was no lines. Just, you know, this
sounds like the beginning of a rape story.

1048
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:36,880
Yeah. Okay. Conveyed. It's mine. Mine
rape. What happened? And I said, uh,

1049
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:39,880
me and Mikey got in a
fight. What happened? I go,

1050
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:42,940
we were talking about King Kong
versus Godzilla and you know,

1051
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:46,030
I liked one and he liked the other and
we've got in a fight. You didn't cry,

1052
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:49,680
did you? I go, no, I didn't cry.
He goes, don't ever cry. Oh.

1053
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,173
And that was the hook.

1054
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:53,470
And he patted me on the head and
he walked out of the room though.

1055
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,120
You didn't give a fuck
that I was in a fight.

1056
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:59,990
He just wanted to make sure there was
no crime bitches in the street. Ah,

1057
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,570
yeah. It was his hack, right.

1058
00:57:02,571 --> 00:57:05,710
Advice for a five year old was punching
everybody after that, I was like,

1059
00:57:05,711 --> 00:57:08,680
all right, you're getting punched.
Talk some shit. I'm punching her cry.

1060
00:57:08,681 --> 00:57:10,570
I got the green light,
I get the green light to punch kids.

1061
00:57:10,571 --> 00:57:14,020
As long as they keep it dry.
It was so stupid.

1062
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:17,500
It was like the worst way of raising
a child ever. Especially boys.

1063
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:21,640
The worst thing you can ever do to
boys is encouraged amongst, oh my God,

1064
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:25,000
it's the worst thing you can ever do.
My friend has a boy and a,

1065
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:27,990
it's really fascinating to watch
this little guy grow up and he's a,

1066
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,590
he's like two now and his personality
is fucking hilarious cause he's like a

1067
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:34,300
little bad ass,
you know?

1068
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:39,190
And he hits things and pushes things
around and it's naturally in him.

1069
00:57:39,191 --> 00:57:42,730
You could see it. He picks the
sticks up and wacks him on things.

1070
00:57:42,731 --> 00:57:47,140
Like that's what he wants to do. He's
two, he's fucking to Matt violent breed.

1071
00:57:47,141 --> 00:57:50,650
Yeah. And when he gets older. If that
kid have a dad, like my dad who was like,

1072
00:57:50,651 --> 00:57:53,110
you know, you know this is how
you fucking hold your hands up.

1073
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:56,110
If somebody gives you any shit,
he hit him with the jab first.

1074
00:57:56,111 --> 00:57:57,420
That way they don't see
the right hand comment.

1075
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:01,270
I was like four he was teaching
me how to fuck people up crazy.

1076
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:06,160
Just ignore police. They'll go away. Oh
No. My Dad wanted me, he was a karate guy,

1077
00:58:06,161 --> 00:58:08,800
so he wanted me to enroll in
karate to when I got older,

1078
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:10,630
but there was no karate
classes for four year olds,

1079
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:14,500
so I had to wait it out and he would
like show him some shit watching

1080
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,820
beat up on. I would watch
him beat guys up at this bar.

1081
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,830
He owned a bar and I was five and I got
to hang out at the bar when I was five.

1082
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,780
When I was five. I would sit there and I
would, I would put money in the jukebox.

1083
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:30,530
They would let me put money in the
jukebox and everything and then I'd watch

1084
00:58:30,531 --> 00:58:34,600
them beat the fuck out of somebody.
That was fine.

1085
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,940
Those are all my memories of my father.

1086
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:42,810
So I go from that to this other dude who's
like super nice and he smokes pot and

1087
00:58:42,971 --> 00:58:45,820
he's really smart.
He's a mathematical genius.

1088
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:49,120
He's a computer programmer and he
decides to computer program is not

1089
00:58:49,121 --> 00:58:50,290
artistically satisfying.

1090
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:53,650
So he wants to go to school and he takes
my mom and he marries her and we move

1091
00:58:53,651 --> 00:58:56,500
across the country and all a sudden I
have this new dad and it's like this hippy

1092
00:58:56,501 --> 00:59:00,820
guy and you know, and he was only
24 years old. Oh yeah. So you know,

1093
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:05,710
my mom was like 30 you know, not even
know. My mom wasn't even 30 what's the,

1094
00:59:05,711 --> 00:59:10,600
I was seven. So my mom was, yeah, she
was like 27 or something like that,

1095
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:15,601
or 28 cause she had me when she was like
2021 so everybody was very young and no

1096
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:16,990
one knew what the fuck was going on.

1097
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:20,410
And then all of a sudden I'm living with
this hippy guy in San Francisco around

1098
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:25,400
a bunch of gay people. That's when I
went from an hour we then right there.

1099
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:29,390
Okay. Then, so I went from
living around these Italian,

1100
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:34,870
New Jersey psychopaths to all of a sudden
I'm in San Francisco and it's all like

1101
00:59:35,181 --> 00:59:36,950
peace and love.
It's the 70s man.

1102
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:41,630
This the 70s everybody had long hair
in San Francisco. Not really man. No.

1103
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:46,670
Carry over at all. No, no. I was pretty,
I was pretty humbled and really shy,

1104
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,940
you know, real nervous and I didn't have
a father anymore. All of a sudden end.

1105
00:59:49,941 --> 00:59:51,490
He wasn't contacting me anymore.
Yeah.

1106
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:54,470
So all of a sudden I'm like out here
going on with a fuck is life. You know,

1107
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:55,071
what am I doing?

1108
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:58,910
I was very insecure and that's when I
really got into drawing from then from

1109
00:59:58,911 --> 01:00:03,050
like seven until like til high school
to my high school art teacher was a

1110
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:06,140
Douchebag, killed my
dreams. But up until then,

1111
01:00:06,141 --> 01:00:10,370
from seven on that was just doing
art constantly, constantly drawing.

1112
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:14,450
That was like my, my outlet. It's my high
school. People used to always tell me,

1113
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:16,650
they were like, I bet you'd really
be good at art if you tried.

1114
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:19,970
That'd be good for anybody who's never
done it. You could do anything, Dude.

1115
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:23,010
You could do anything. You
know, if you're, it's the,

1116
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,160
the Miyamoto Musashi quote that I always,

1117
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:29,000
they always talk about once you become,
once you know,

1118
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:31,490
the way broadly you can
see it in all things.

1119
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:34,100
Once you become really good at something,
you figure something out.

1120
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:37,130
Like you figured out, stand up, you
figured out a way to construct a bit,

1121
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,830
you figured out a way to go on there
and just kill in front of a group of

1122
01:00:39,831 --> 01:00:42,140
strangers can be figured out.
Yeah, you can do anything man.

1123
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,560
You just need to have the
love and passion for it.

1124
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:47,660
It doesn't mean you can do anything that
sucks, you know, you might not want to,

1125
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:52,190
you part of like being good at
anything is being excited about it.

1126
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:56,900
I was talking about, and he's
pretty much just writing now and um,

1127
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:59,480
and he's like, I'm trying to write
like sitcoms or script and it's like,

1128
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:00,950
it's tough,
but he understands.

1129
01:01:00,951 --> 01:01:04,130
It's like I'm going to write a few that
aren't going to be good so that they

1130
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:07,760
will then get good. That's the
path to make something good. Yeah.

1131
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:11,810
You've got to suffer, you
know, to get good at anything.
It's sucks man. You know,

1132
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:16,400
I just started doing Jujitsu again because
my, I took like two months off man.

1133
01:01:16,401 --> 01:01:19,610
I kept reinjuring this part of
my back like over and over again.

1134
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,430
But then I started getting,
um,

1135
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:26,030
a cold laser therapy on it and
I went to deep tissue massage.

1136
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:31,760
Massage by a dude was just first time
ever I got massaged by a dude once back

1137
01:01:31,761 --> 01:01:33,700
when I was fighting. That
was really good. Wait,

1138
01:01:33,701 --> 01:01:38,090
why didn't you just tap out right there?
No, no, no, because this guy is a,

1139
01:01:38,091 --> 01:01:42,740
he's an expert in, um, it's called,
I'll tell you what it's called. Shit.

1140
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:47,330
It's like neuromuscular education.
I was like neuromuscular reeducation.

1141
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:52,040
It's a specific type of stretching and
deep tissue massage. At the same time,

1142
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,640
there was developed by these people who
are strengthened for fitness trainers

1143
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,600
and this guy was the former head
strength and fitness coach for Purdue

1144
01:01:59,600 --> 01:01:59,750
University.

1145
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:03,320
He's got like all these cutting edge
techniques and it hurts like fucking shit.

1146
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,750
It's like,
it's not like to go and get a massage.

1147
01:02:05,751 --> 01:02:07,470
You go to a chiropractor's office,
you know,

1148
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,810
just like out of the phobia keeps us
from getting a massage with stronger next

1149
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,080
to this guy. This is clearly not
gay. I'm not trying to get there.

1150
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:20,010
But the dude dude who breaks
me down is like, he's two 60.

1151
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,530
He's a fucking crowd.
He's like six foot three.

1152
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:26,010
So one of those 50 year old dude's, it
looks like you beat the fuck out of you.

1153
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:28,770
He's like 50 years old. These
giant hands, these giant arms.

1154
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:31,560
You need a dude like the
sounds gay as fuck somebody.

1155
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:36,090
Please do not make this an animated little
clip and put it on the internet or me

1156
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:41,190
getting a boner. But I'll tell this
guy, it should be fucking do shit.

1157
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:44,370
He can do shit that those little
Thailand women can't do. Man.

1158
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:48,150
He can hurt you dude. And the breaks
all your scar tissue up. And the, the,

1159
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:52,530
the key is when, as I understand it, when
you, um, anytime you do any activity, any,

1160
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:55,740
any physical straining exercise,
when you're sore,

1161
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:59,880
it's lactic acid and it's also a muscle
tears, little, little tiny muscle tears.

1162
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:01,140
And that's what makes you stronger.

1163
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:04,530
Your muscles have a little little tears
and they heal up and becomes stronger

1164
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:07,680
though. So, but in the process of
doing that, it's been explained to me,

1165
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,890
you develop scar tissue in there and
you have to break it up in order to get

1166
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:13,110
full movement of the muscles.
If you don't,

1167
01:03:13,111 --> 01:03:17,400
it results in injuries and when you
exercise a lot but you don't get your scar

1168
01:03:17,401 --> 01:03:21,030
tissue broken down and broke, you are
more likely to suffer from injuries,

1169
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:22,950
from being tight injuries
from being locked up.

1170
01:03:22,951 --> 01:03:26,640
And I was having that until I started
going and I gave in and started getting

1171
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:27,510
massaged by a dude.

1172
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:32,420
This is the reasons why I'm not going to
go back to digit to know all about this.

1173
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:36,870
I enjoy a Jujitsu man. When I'm doing
Jujitsu, I don't think about shit.

1174
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,950
I just think I try to do that when I'm
playing pool. But when I'm playing pool,

1175
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:42,900
it's up to me. You know,
when I'm playing pool,

1176
01:03:42,901 --> 01:03:46,490
it's up to me to zone out and focus on
a thing. But when you're doing Jujitsu,

1177
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:47,610
you have no choice,
man.

1178
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,420
I just don't like the risk of me limping
when Adler for I know what you mean.

1179
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:54,150
I'm willing to deal with. Again,
I'm not worried about it, man.

1180
01:03:54,151 --> 01:03:57,900
I know a lot of people. I know a lot
of people do it. You can get hurt.

1181
01:03:57,901 --> 01:04:01,080
It is possible, but if you roll
a smart people and you, you,

1182
01:04:01,081 --> 01:04:02,340
you roll intelligently.

1183
01:04:02,341 --> 01:04:05,550
You don't try to use too much physical
strength and willing to tap out.

1184
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:08,280
If you're in a bad situation,
you're not really in danger, man.

1185
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:10,440
As long as you're rolling with
friends, you know. I mean,

1186
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:13,950
I haven't the hurt somebody else.
Every falls last time. Yeah.

1187
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:18,060
The last time I heard somebody was an
accident, complete accident. A guy was a,

1188
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:20,520
I was passing his guard and
something popped on his leg.

1189
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:23,160
He tried to post up and his leg gave
out like a ligament came out. Well,

1190
01:04:23,161 --> 01:04:26,190
good to hear it pop. I felt
terrible, but it was nothing I did.

1191
01:04:26,191 --> 01:04:28,110
It was just part of rolling your,

1192
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:32,220
you'd try to get a grip and that doesn't
work was on my back and my foot was

1193
01:04:32,221 --> 01:04:35,310
down and it just, he was heavy. He didn't
jump on me or anything. He was just,

1194
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:37,430
and then just buckled over
my foot and I'm like, no,

1195
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,280
that's just to stop immediately.
But it was like, it happens Ruth.

1196
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,270
But you know what,
man,

1197
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:46,170
I think there's so much benefit in
doing it for me at least everybody's

1198
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,280
different, Brian. I don't,

1199
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:50,190
I really believe him when he says he
doesn't need it because everybody's got

1200
01:04:50,191 --> 01:04:53,970
their own physical requirement for
them. Yeah. It's not just that,

1201
01:04:53,971 --> 01:04:55,970
it's physical requirements.
You know,

1202
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:58,590
like some people they have
to blow off steam. Oh right.

1203
01:04:58,770 --> 01:04:59,800
You know some people like and,

1204
01:04:59,801 --> 01:05:02,160
and they're intense people and
they have to blow off that steam.

1205
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:04,290
And if they don't blow
off that steam in the gym,

1206
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:07,830
it can leak out into everyday
life and make them unreasonable.

1207
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:10,410
And then they'll blow up about
things that don't make sense.

1208
01:05:10,411 --> 01:05:11,250
Like they get mad at things.

1209
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:14,190
There's only one reason to get mad
at something that doesn't make sense.

1210
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,160
You have some extra tension.
Sleep. Yeah. And you're approaching

1211
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,280
the situation. You're already at a five
before you walk into the door. Yeah.

1212
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:24,910
It's first here to irritability goes.
So this person comes at you with a two,

1213
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,530
which should be like, Oh man, really?

1214
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:31,060
Oh what instead of you like this is the
same fucking shit with you owe to him.

1215
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:34,270
And really you're raging
against is your own shit life.

1216
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:35,710
That's what you're raging against.

1217
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:38,410
But everybody else gets caught
in the fucking crossfire. Yeah.

1218
01:05:38,411 --> 01:05:42,250
Norton talked about that as unmasked
interview without [inaudible]. Yeah,

1219
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:44,550
he was like when he was off on break he,

1220
01:05:44,551 --> 01:05:48,610
it's so much thinner cause he needed to
fucking pull off Craig's team. You know?

1221
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,730
But if he had ona, he can
do that every morning. Yeah.

1222
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:55,270
He used to write great blogs too, man.
Norton road, some hilarious blog entries.

1223
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:58,840
But he stopped doing that also when he
was doing ona all the time cause he feels

1224
01:05:58,841 --> 01:06:00,520
like creatively fulfilled.
And you know what,

1225
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:02,560
that's an important thing
about being creative, man.

1226
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:05,140
You don't want to work too
hard and it sounds ridiculous,

1227
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:08,710
but there's a certain amount of time
where you should be dedicating to having

1228
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:12,550
fun as well. Building up new members
to write about. And, and not only that,

1229
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,760
just living your life
man, you know, and you,

1230
01:06:14,761 --> 01:06:18,220
you can only spend a certain amount
of time, you know, working on,

1231
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,860
on anything that you know is,

1232
01:06:19,861 --> 01:06:22,480
is it like a creative venture and we'll
are doing like radio show and you're

1233
01:06:22,481 --> 01:06:26,290
doing four or five hours a day and then
you're doing standup at night and you're

1234
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:30,070
writing this, you don't have much
downtime in the middle there. You know.

1235
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:31,150
And a guy like Norton,

1236
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:34,990
it's probably way better for his happiness
to just chill out and those hours,

1237
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:39,190
I'm sure he's not chilling eyes getting
hookers and doing some dirty now more

1238
01:06:39,191 --> 01:06:42,280
and more lately if I had like a spot at
the store and it's like a late spot and

1239
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:44,560
like I'm doing something fun
like I'm at a party or something,

1240
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:45,880
I'm like no I should be here.

1241
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:49,360
I'll get more creative like out of here
that I will just rehearsing in front of

1242
01:06:49,361 --> 01:06:51,700
eight people.
It's a part of your job.

1243
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,330
I mean one of the reasons why I moved
to Colorado. Absolutely true. It was,

1244
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:59,830
I'm like, I am getting some
fucking material out of this
for sure. And I did. Yeah.

1245
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:04,700
And you know, at a cost, but
you know, sacrifice. No matter.

1246
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:07,420
I mean, I think about that all
the time. Like I put myself,

1247
01:07:07,421 --> 01:07:09,950
that's why I wanted to meet some
of those ferries. That's why I'm,

1248
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:13,150
I'm thinking about, uh, I
went to a furry convention.

1249
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,760
Oh, furry. I talking to Eric to

1250
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:22,900
get a flying around all the time, giving
me advice. It's size from Tim Ferris. Not,

1251
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:25,320
not that kind of fairy. This guy is
not, I'm not like that. How dare you?

1252
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,480
How dare you? I'm sorry. Don't
put those thoughts in my mind. Um,

1253
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:34,020
what the fuck were we just talking about?
Furries for convention? The shining,

1254
01:07:34,021 --> 01:07:38,970
that one scene that somebody posts that
I remember it. Was that the first furry,

1255
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:43,380
I don't know. Maybe that'd be furry.
Something that existed like forever. Yeah,

1256
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:45,780
late seventies,
early eighties,

1257
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:50,700
something like that where somebody sent
me a photo of, you forgot about that.

1258
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:52,830
Somebody sent me a photo of Osu,

1259
01:07:52,831 --> 01:07:56,220
like this furry people at night
and it was like seven of them.

1260
01:07:56,221 --> 01:07:59,940
And they looked like scary kind
of distant. It was in Cleveland.

1261
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:03,030
It was in Cincinnati, Columbus. But yeah,
there's a Columbus. Yeah, I thought so.

1262
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:05,580
We're wherever it is. I heard about
it. I didn't see the photo though.

1263
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,810
It was a crazy, yeah, it's weird.
What was it? What was going on? We,

1264
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:08,820
we're talking about this yesterday.
Yes sir.

1265
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:11,580
On the podcast.
So people that have already heard this,

1266
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:14,850
I'll just give you the brief version of
it. There's a thing called being a furry,

1267
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,010
and I know people that

1268
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,810
are sexually attracted to,
you know about it.

1269
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,100
There was a convention of
them in Pittsburgh last week.

1270
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,520
And so what were they doing there? What
was that at Ohio state. Well, they have,

1271
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:27,040
somebody came and somebody sent me a
photo of them just across the street. Oh,

1272
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:30,230
just hang out in a barn. No, we
haven't been Columbus, Ohio too.

1273
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:33,320
And they all hang out on the streets
and stuff together. It's kind of like a,

1274
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:37,370
like a gang of mascot stuffed
animals are so weird, dude.

1275
01:08:37,371 --> 01:08:40,790
And you don't know what's, you can't read
them at all. And it's all sexual. Yeah.

1276
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:43,670
Well, it's sexual, but it's
also just fantasy. You know,

1277
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:47,000
they'll get together and they actually
play like dungeons and dragons and shit.

1278
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:50,980
Like this is like the recreating like
the like a like whatever like Giles and

1279
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:55,120
stuff. No, no. Their version of
that like well sort of. Yeah, yeah,

1280
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,530
yeah.
I wrote a blog entry about that too,

1281
01:08:57,531 --> 01:09:00,470
about going to the renaissance fair
and it seen how fucking strange it was.

1282
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:04,460
And there was a one particular thing that
was really strange. Most of the people,

1283
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,210
it was really kind of admirable because
most of the people stayed in character.

1284
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,170
Most of the dam,

1285
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:14,390
no standing here having a
pound your chest at the world,

1286
01:09:14,391 --> 01:09:16,130
you know,
I wish I wasn't too cool for that,

1287
01:09:16,131 --> 01:09:18,800
but I just couldn't bring myself
to the puck and go full out.

1288
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:22,490
Well it would probably be a good test
of your ability to act, you know?

1289
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,610
Because if you could go there
and just throw yourself into it,

1290
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:29,000
like really be zen about
being one of those guys.

1291
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,780
I thought it'd be probably a good exercise
if you like a crazy person wanting to

1292
01:09:32,781 --> 01:09:36,450
act. But when we were there, um, one
of the things that was fascinating,

1293
01:09:36,451 --> 01:09:40,250
it was most of the people
were in character, but this
one lady, man, this one lady,

1294
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:43,220
you could tell she's only in the
renaissance faire because she's like,

1295
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,650
she needs to be in some sort of a group.
It's like,

1296
01:09:45,651 --> 01:09:47,690
when is she going know you're
going to play Bingo? Okay,

1297
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,360
I'll be down with the renaissance fair.
So this,

1298
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:54,470
this woman was sitting there and the
woman was all in character and shit and

1299
01:09:54,471 --> 01:09:56,810
this other lady was talking
to her about her problems,

1300
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:00,530
but she was talking to her or
like in normal terms, she's like,

1301
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:05,390
so now Mike has to figure out which
prescription to take the one doctor.

1302
01:10:05,391 --> 01:10:09,710
Like she's, you know, to do it like
that one lady that doom and gloom.

1303
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:14,000
And so, um, the other woman
won't, won't crack. She goes,

1304
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:18,710
what tough my lady mean by prescription.
So word I've never heard before,

1305
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:20,870
you know? And so she starts, you know,

1306
01:10:20,871 --> 01:10:23,540
fucking weather while this chick
is trying to complain to her.

1307
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:25,340
How would she react when she really,
well,

1308
01:10:25,341 --> 01:10:28,460
she followed her and then they walked
away and I didn't want to follow them and

1309
01:10:28,461 --> 01:10:31,010
be that obvious listening
in on the conversation.

1310
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:34,100
But it was obvious that one chick was
being a little cunty and she was bringing

1311
01:10:34,101 --> 01:10:37,490
her boring shit into this
beautiful land of make believe.

1312
01:10:37,491 --> 01:10:40,720
And I'm pretending I'm a maiden here and
you're talking to me about, you know,

1313
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:43,330
your, your, your, your husband,
Mike's Prescriptions, you know,

1314
01:10:43,331 --> 01:10:46,250
you do what the fuck we need to do, lady,
you know, this is not the time for this.

1315
01:10:46,251 --> 01:10:48,830
Maybe afterwards if we're going to go
have a drink and a cigarette, you know,

1316
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:51,590
you want to sit down and talk to me about
your life, that's cool. But right now,

1317
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,320
you know, all this God damn maiden,
their work at renaissance fairs,

1318
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,860
they're all fucking at night. Oh,
they just get together and bang.

1319
01:10:57,890 --> 01:11:00,310
I talked to people. One of the guys
just work the breakdown prop, uh,

1320
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:03,610
always quit for those two weeks
while they're here and I'm there.

1321
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:07,820
So I asked them questions for two weeks
to go hang out with them. Yeah, awesome.

1322
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,833
That is awesome.

1323
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:11,590
And he'd go through Lizard works there
every year and I'd like to think people

1324
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,980
like it's her fucking going on. He
goes, that's all that's going on.

1325
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:18,090
See that's seven o'clock you can do
that when you don't have kids. Oh yeah,

1326
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:21,670
you can go to renaissance fair. I fucked
the shit out of everybody. When you're,

1327
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:24,540
when you're totally single,
I know you don't have a girlfriend.

1328
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:27,960
Just going to have been a science fair
and just clean up knocking out of the

1329
01:11:27,961 --> 01:11:31,020
ballpark because they're supposed to
have origins. They had origins back then.

1330
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:32,910
No one's got a cell phone.
It's Renaissance Times.

1331
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:37,190
Put that fucking cell phone away right
away and complete this train. Yes.

1332
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,120
You don't have to worry about
like getting on the Internet.

1333
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,140
Everybody's like sticking to the code.
This is the color.

1334
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:46,620
It must be so easy to be a whore back then
he uses lie, you know, like just bang.

1335
01:11:46,621 --> 01:11:50,760
All kinds of dudes everywhere in the
little pictures from back then you would

1336
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:54,410
have sex with your cousins and sisters
too. They just fuck everybody back then.

1337
01:11:54,411 --> 01:11:56,480
Yeah. I don't think there
was a bad thing. It really,

1338
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:00,060
when do you think that incest
becomes a bad no, that was our,

1339
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,400
they had Christians in the renaissance.

1340
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,600
How common is it assessing the animal
world? It's common with dogs, right?

1341
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:10,470
Zero incest. Incest in the animal world.
Yeah. In the animal world. Pretty common.

1342
01:12:10,471 --> 01:12:13,710
Right. They bang their,
their cousins for sure.

1343
01:12:13,711 --> 01:12:15,840
The banging his sisters because
they don't know any better.

1344
01:12:15,841 --> 01:12:17,180
They'll bang their sisters. Right? Yeah.

1345
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:20,950
If you leave them alone under
bite was created. Yeah. It's like

1346
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:27,700
stay away from their own exact
siblings. I'm like, Woah,

1347
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,370
don't they go off on their own?
I don't know how that works.

1348
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:32,430
I'm not sure if they do it
or not. Hmm. I think, uh,

1349
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:35,460
that's one of the things that they say
about certain Labrador retrievers is that

1350
01:12:35,461 --> 01:12:38,740
they are inbred. Yeah. That's what
they say about a, a bad genetic,

1351
01:12:38,741 --> 01:12:40,140
what you mean what they say it about them?

1352
01:12:40,141 --> 01:12:42,690
That means most of them that
don't do that or wouldn't do that.

1353
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:45,150
I think most of them,
most of them don't,

1354
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:47,790
but there are a few would in the
puppy mills and stuff like that.

1355
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:49,290
I'd be surprised who know
I'm talking to my ass.

1356
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:51,390
I don't know what the actual number.
So tiger and a lion wants,

1357
01:12:51,391 --> 01:12:55,140
but it's like that'll never
happen in nature. Yeah. I wonder.

1358
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:59,610
Hmm could it? Yeah, sure. But is there
a place where there's lions and tigers?

1359
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:03,590
Is there a place Zeus. Oh, both
of them together. You Man. Yeah,

1360
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:09,970
cause I think tigers are in Asia and
you know in Africa is where lions are,

1361
01:13:10,741 --> 01:13:14,070
right? Siberian tigers through. They're
all over. Yeah. Siberia is though.

1362
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:17,960
Isn't that Kinda like Asia Ish is Europe.
What is it? Where Europe and Asia.

1363
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,190
Russia, my geography slash.
Afghanistan. What is this?

1364
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:26,670
Where you fuck up? That's all I know.
When we were kids, when you fuck up,

1365
01:13:26,671 --> 01:13:31,020
they sent you to Siberia.
Siberia is the worst place you gets.

1366
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:34,620
Get all cold notes. It.
No clothes or anything.

1367
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,520
You done fucked up son. You got to
go to site. Ever wrap my head around.

1368
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:40,990
How do people not just die outside?

1369
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,930
Remember when rocky was training in
Siberia to prove how bad ass he was.

1370
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:48,230
He was lifting weird. That's how he's
trained lifting. We're tire up though.

1371
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:51,660
He was running out in the snow and he
wasn't doing any boxing and all we had for

1372
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:53,490
motivation or was a picture of Drago.

1373
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:59,280
He was going to completely olds glue
throwing logs and the snow and running

1374
01:13:59,281 --> 01:14:01,020
uphill in the snow.
It's hard. It ended up,

1375
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:04,110
the crowd starts chanting his named
switching over from the home tab.

1376
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,060
Now we want a brilliant film.
Awesome.

1377
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:10,950
This awesome this and its purest American
rechargeable killed Apollo creed. Okay.

1378
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:12,070
A perfect example.
That

1379
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,730
movie is retarded. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
I like the knitting of the word. Yeah,

1380
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:20,080
that's what it is, man. You know, look,
we shouldn't be mean to people for sure,

1381
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:23,620
but you shouldn't make words off use
when they have a bunch of different uses.

1382
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:25,170
I think a bunch of
different matters really,

1383
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,360
but it's definitely come from making
fun of the idea of being retarded,

1384
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:32,080
but honestly it's worse. Yeah.
I don't want to be retarded.

1385
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:34,930
I wouldn't mind being two
inches shorter or taller,

1386
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,170
but I definitely don't want to be
retarded. It's worse for sure. Yeah.

1387
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,020
You make a comparison of that
to say that's a bad thing. Yeah.

1388
01:14:41,021 --> 01:14:44,170
What you shouldn't do is like make fun
of them. The same things about them,

1389
01:14:44,171 --> 01:14:46,960
but to use the word, but they all laugh
with them and stuff. That's different.

1390
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:51,670
I guess if you were standing next to
someone, here's the argument though.

1391
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,850
I guess if you're standing next to someone
and they had [inaudible] syndrome kid

1392
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:57,610
and it wouldn't be on the phone going,
dude, you're being such a retard.

1393
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:01,780
You wouldn't say that because you would
feel bad that that people could hear

1394
01:15:01,781 --> 01:15:04,430
that. So my argument just
fucking shit the bed. Yeah.

1395
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:07,630
My argument is it's totally feel bad
about it. Now that you've read it.

1396
01:15:07,631 --> 01:15:08,800
You're right.
You shouldn't say it,

1397
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:13,350
but that's stupid because you should
definitely make sure there's no, um,

1398
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:17,580
to say to retard takes away the idea
that we ever call them retarded.

1399
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:19,160
That's work.
You know,

1400
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:23,170
Thompson chorus had real problems with
that bit that he does about midgets.

1401
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:26,460
Oh yeah. Real problems. Like people
are mad or like don't say it. Yeah.

1402
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:28,030
People don't want him to
say they don't want them.

1403
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:30,790
They certainly don't want to making
fun of midgets and it's a funny bit but

1404
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:31,810
supposed to fuck her funny.

1405
01:15:31,811 --> 01:15:34,550
But it's like I get it doing it in
Kara Haughey midgets but it's like yeah

1406
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,460
that's the bit and you know,

1407
01:15:36,461 --> 01:15:40,620
people have come to these shows and then
like cried and yelled at the manager.

1408
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:45,100
Really have a son that you know has
just leave

1409
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,810
with ridiculous as that family
guy gets away with it every week,

1410
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:51,530
every week they got everything.
I got in some trouble.

1411
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:54,500
You think I never hear about family guy
getting in trouble and they pretty much

1412
01:15:54,501 --> 01:15:55,780
do. They have that it's
harder character on it.

1413
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:58,810
They got an a little bit trouble trouble

1414
01:15:58,860 --> 01:15:59,950
cause they'll never remember.

1415
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:02,890
It's Tracy Morgan the most in trouble
that you can ever remember right now.

1416
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:04,790
A celebrity or celebrity or comment.

1417
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:09,760
Mel Gibson was one murder obviously Oj
assumption. Uh, Charlie Sheen. Yeah.

1418
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,400
It's like those bigger ones than that.
But like little things like go, I'm sorry,

1419
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:16,660
I just hit the guy in trouble for what
he said. Oh, that guy, the other guy,

1420
01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:19,730
a faggot and wouldn't back down off.
It really? Is that what happened?

1421
01:16:19,731 --> 01:16:23,130
How he did it? That kind of it.
Tim Hardaway, who's Tim Hardaway,

1422
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,260
the basketball player. I went
to Utep. You tips to step.

1423
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:30,310
He was really good and he played for
the heat I think, and a bunch of it.

1424
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,590
And they were interviewing him.
This is the late eighties, I think,

1425
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:37,660
maybe nine days. Um, but anyway,
and they were like, you know,

1426
01:16:37,661 --> 01:16:39,670
what do you think about that
might be gay NBA players.

1427
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,620
And that was like a big
thing, right? And it goes, oh,

1428
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:44,530
I don't want to play with them. I
don't like, because I don't like them.

1429
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:48,190
I don't want gays around me. I want him
in the locker room. And they're like, uh,

1430
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,930
the guy who was interviewing was
giving him a chance, like, okay,

1431
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,980
you don't want to get misquoted
here. So try not to, I mean,

1432
01:16:53,981 --> 01:16:56,140
you'd obviously don't mean, you
know, like it as it goes. Oh No,

1433
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,510
I don't like homosexuals.
Whoa.

1434
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:01,270
It was like really bad and he
never did another endorsement ever.

1435
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:05,570
It was like he was going after that. I
shouldn't say ever, but like he was just

1436
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:10,030
now you can't do that alone.
Yup.

1437
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:13,400
Funny people got in trouble for it. Yeah.
Things have changed. People are, well,

1438
01:17:13,401 --> 01:17:17,330
I say that's, it's gotta be a good thing
even if I don't believe in some of it.

1439
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:20,920
I think that, uh, you know, here's
where I like idea behind it is good.

1440
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:24,200
I like about the gay community because
whenever somebody says that what they do

1441
01:17:24,201 --> 01:17:26,630
is they take, give a donation
and be a spokesman. No,

1442
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:29,360
they don't hold this shit against you. Or
they're like, it's okay, you fucked up,

1443
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,910
but one you won't fuck up anymore
public and you're going to help.

1444
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:35,600
You're going to use your celebrity to
help kids feel normalized. Well, you know,

1445
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:38,240
I mean, look, that's always a good,
they'll do it. That's always a good thing.

1446
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:40,910
But you know, when we get back
to that Tracy Morgan thing,

1447
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:41,751
it seems like people are,

1448
01:17:41,751 --> 01:17:45,590
everyone's getting mad at Tracy Morgan
now because they can get away with it

1449
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:49,940
because he'll apologize. Yeah, fuck, it's
so bad. I can't, I'm terrible about this.

1450
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:53,210
I mean I really hate it. Brian Holtzman
say shit a thousand times worse.

1451
01:17:53,211 --> 01:17:56,300
The Tracy Morgan, but nobody knows
Brian holds cause nobody knows him.

1452
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:58,430
I remember this one time,
this guy, and it's context,

1453
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,870
there's one guy in the audience,

1454
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:04,580
I was doing something about using the
n word as like Jews were the original

1455
01:18:04,581 --> 01:18:05,630
niggers.
I said whatever,

1456
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,350
but I wanted to use it as is and the guy
does a jovial black guy in the audience

1457
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:12,980
like fun and big and goes, no, no it's
Nigga you got to say Nigga with an a.

1458
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,740
And I was like, okay, so no matter what,
then it's okay. And he goes, yeah, yeah,

1459
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:18,370
totally cool. And I started
saying, so you degenerate,

1460
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:22,700
Niggas are taking all of our money
from the government. You Niggas,

1461
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:26,660
I don't want to Nick God dating my
daughter. And he was dying laughing.

1462
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,170
We were all okay, but if you put that
on paper and take it out of context,

1463
01:18:30,171 --> 01:18:32,630
it's towns and seems so much worse.
Yeah.

1464
01:18:32,631 --> 01:18:36,770
There's a button pushing thing that you
do on stage where you say this shed that

1465
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:41,240
somebody thinks but would never say and
you know saying cause you believe in it

1466
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:45,830
because St cloud is a ridiculous thing
to say because it's like Louis Ck has a

1467
01:18:45,831 --> 01:18:49,250
bit, I think about hitting his kid, you
know, a punch you in the fucking face.

1468
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:53,210
Like I believe that's a line. Somebody
what did that in a message board recently?

1469
01:18:53,211 --> 01:18:56,000
You know, did I get to see somebody going,
you shouldn't advocate child beating.

1470
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:59,930
They were comparing the satire of him
saying that to what Tracy Morgan said,

1471
01:18:59,931 --> 01:19:01,420
that it's obvious that somebody he's not,

1472
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:04,790
he doesn't really mean that he's saying
it because it's a ridiculous thing to

1473
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:09,590
say and that's fun to do. You can't
hold a comic hostage, you know,

1474
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:13,910
or hold them accountable for the meaning
of something that's said in a standup

1475
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:17,960
comic way as if it was their actual
true thought. Because if you do that,

1476
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:22,160
you're restricting that kind of outrageous
comedy that I think is really funny.

1477
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,620
But the only way you can create that
training a bald eagle to land on his head,

1478
01:19:26,621 --> 01:19:29,450
his head, he only way you can
do that type of comedy though,

1479
01:19:29,451 --> 01:19:33,380
is to have the freedom to say really
offensive shit and know that people are

1480
01:19:33,381 --> 01:19:34,370
gonna know it's satire.

1481
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,570
There other people are gonna
know that you're fucking
around. Yeah. You know? Yeah.

1482
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:41,300
So if you don't allow a guy like
Tracy Morgan to say fucked up shit,

1483
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,180
you're going to kill a whole
genre of awesome comedy.

1484
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:48,920
You know the Jim Norton Genre of comedy,
like his, some of his shit. I mean, dude,

1485
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:52,310
he's, it's really offensive
to a lot of people I'm sure,

1486
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:54,950
but fucking hilarious.
I like to say this.

1487
01:19:54,951 --> 01:19:59,270
If Sam Kinison was coming up in la now
and comic, he wouldn't get staged. Right,

1488
01:19:59,271 --> 01:20:02,030
man, you're white. You're right.
Nobody put that guy on too.

1489
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:06,710
How about his bit about aids? Yeah. He
goes, cause some fags fucked a monkey.

1490
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,590
No, I got to wear a condom. But honestly
that's what people thought of it.

1491
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:14,520
Then it was the only gay disease.
Yeah. I would never, I would never see,

1492
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:16,160
I've never,
I stopped using the word Faggot,

1493
01:20:16,161 --> 01:20:17,910
but I would never use it for a gay person.

1494
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:20,850
I use it to describe the
fact that I don't use it.

1495
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:24,540
I need to bring up,

1496
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:30,290
I just like to hear the crystals,
how it cracks off of your tongue,

1497
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,070
but like a hack. Here's the problem.
Your own roles. Here's a pop.

1498
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:37,800
We've been saying this for a six
and seven, but I don't, it's hard.

1499
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:40,210
I don't just take it for so long.
Well,

1500
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,210
unless like Louis Ck says that give a
fuck. They did anyway. Kind of really,

1501
01:20:44,211 --> 01:20:48,530
that's another brilliant Louis C K bit
about if they're being faggots are people

1502
01:20:48,531 --> 01:20:53,380
from Phoenix Venetians. Cause like
you're being a faggot. It was uh,

1503
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:57,170
a bit about the correct use of
the word. You know, look man,

1504
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:00,910
we all know what the fuck it is. It's
context. Context is what matters little.

1505
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:04,310
We've, we've created these
a hot button words man,

1506
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:08,540
and they're undeniable power to them.
Yeah. Undeniable Improv. It have power.

1507
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:13,070
There's hypercharged you
know, and I forget all the
time. I forget all the time.

1508
01:21:13,071 --> 01:21:16,280
I'll say something and I'll see someone
get shocked and I'm okay, I guess.

1509
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:17,580
I guess you don't think the way?

1510
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:20,630
I think all the time somebody
drops an f bomb or says, yeah,

1511
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:24,560
I guess an f bomb or whatever.
Then it's a, you see a crowd.

1512
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,690
People turn around and get quiet.
Fuck yeah.

1513
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:31,080
If two gay guys adopt a kid and
a little babies that a fig lit,

1514
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:36,220
oh dare you. How dare you?
What is a word for this?

1515
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:39,560
You don't say fag. It would be fabulous.
It would be family. It would be fashion.

1516
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:44,350
Rogatory term for it is not nearly as
offensive camp. It's a bat preposterous.

1517
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:47,800
What? Black Baby? A black
gay baby. Yeah. Dare you.

1518
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:52,250
How dare you Brian. This is not
funny. I'm fucking gonna lose my Gig.

1519
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:56,330
We hard obviously can fuck it all up.

1520
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:01,500
Fucking Goddamn Prague. But that's
the problem. The money man does it.

1521
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:05,270
Yeah, exactly. Here we are.
Three people, three friends,

1522
01:22:05,271 --> 01:22:08,330
three great friends sitting
around shooting the shit.
How many a conversation,

1523
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:12,680
obviously with no malice towards anyone.
A lot of the shit that we've said today,

1524
01:22:12,681 --> 01:22:15,230
especially if you take it out of context
like that holds the thing that you did

1525
01:22:15,231 --> 01:22:18,270
about Nigga though do it.
If someone took that out of context,

1526
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,210
I'm pretty terrible and I
wouldn't want look terrible.

1527
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:23,300
They will turn and then we would have
who would have to go back and get the raw

1528
01:22:23,301 --> 01:22:26,180
video and edit, if you will. The
youtube thing. And here's the context.

1529
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:29,850
I think I was quoted to that. They're all
saying like nuts, not the exact quote,

1530
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:32,370
the quote they put out there
as if I had a gay baby,

1531
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:35,390
I would take out a knife
and stabbed to death. Right.

1532
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:38,370
But he said something like way
different than that. Really? Yeah.

1533
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:41,380
I kind of wish I knew what it was. That
context of it though, was that the, the,

1534
01:22:41,381 --> 01:22:44,670
the, that's what the guy wrote
when he left the show and got mad,

1535
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:47,170
wrote off Facebook and started
cutting everything up in arms.

1536
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:49,260
Guys been popped without a video.

1537
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:52,530
Cause it doesn't seem like there's
a video of it. There's not. Yeah.

1538
01:22:52,531 --> 01:22:56,850
That's kind of weird. I've never seen
anybody, one person did not film that.

1539
01:22:57,570 --> 01:22:59,850
Mel Gibson. Yeah, that's all cops.

1540
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:03,390
But they have leased officers stating
what he said. It sounds more real.

1541
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:06,040
That's true. Yeah, it must. Well everybody

1542
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,440
thought it was a possibly bullshit though.

1543
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,900
It's like maybe these officers
were Dick heads. Right. You know,

1544
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:13,810
maybe they just being an asshole and
they don't like him for whatever reason.

1545
01:23:13,811 --> 01:23:17,350
So they put it, but then when he went on
that crazy, but it did it another time.

1546
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:20,650
That crazy rant that he did on that
chick's answer machines is answered all

1547
01:23:20,651 --> 01:23:25,180
questions real. And that was like, no
one's ever going to hear this shit. Ooh.

1548
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:29,080
That was, that was intense,
man. That was some intense shit.

1549
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:33,490
It's like you see that and you
realize you want to become a star.

1550
01:23:33,491 --> 01:23:37,150
So girls like all galleys girls and
they'll stop driving me crazy and it never

1551
01:23:37,151 --> 01:23:38,440
gets any better.

1552
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:43,580
It's because what are you
looking to change things?
Well, it's what you get. It's,

1553
01:23:43,581 --> 01:23:45,160
it's, yeah, it's what, what
are you putting out there?

1554
01:23:45,161 --> 01:23:47,370
That's exactly what you're going
to give back. You know, if,

1555
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,000
and especially with him,

1556
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:52,600
I think Mel Gibson has got something
wrong with his brain. That's what I think,

1557
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:56,410
you know, I think there's,
there's a, there's a pathology
there. There's an issue,

1558
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,670
there's an imbalance.

1559
01:23:57,671 --> 01:24:02,020
It doesn't seem to be just as simple
as he believes wacky shit. You know,

1560
01:24:02,021 --> 01:24:06,100
like his dad didn't, doesn't believe in
the Holocaust. It's not as simple as that.

1561
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:10,780
There's a programming situation.
Yeah, there's a chemical situation.

1562
01:24:10,781 --> 01:24:13,290
There's something wrong. He's
a crazy person, you know,

1563
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,750
which is why that fucking beaver movie
was so bizarre because it was about,

1564
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,580
I mean,
what a crazy fucking idea for a movie.

1565
01:24:21,581 --> 01:24:25,310
And then imagine talking people into
making this movie and then this mother

1566
01:24:25,311 --> 01:24:29,140
fucker goes crazy right before the movie
gets released. Sort of perfect for it.

1567
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:33,400
Not really though, because nobody
wanted it. They didn't like him anymore.

1568
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:37,570
People are done with Mel Gibson. That's
second, second strike. They're like,

1569
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:41,100
it's what just mistake man know
the eyes are on you. Again, when,

1570
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,300
when people talk about
like knowing somebody,

1571
01:24:43,301 --> 01:24:47,350
and one of the beautiful things about
this podcast is that this is a kind of a

1572
01:24:47,351 --> 01:24:47,771
format,

1573
01:24:47,771 --> 01:24:50,530
and you and I were talking about this
for we're playing pool where you really

1574
01:24:50,531 --> 01:24:54,190
completely get to know somebody. You know,
it wasn't up talk. You're talking two,

1575
01:24:54,191 --> 01:24:57,340
three hours a day, you know several
times it, that is who you are,

1576
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:01,000
you know that that is who you are.
But for most people they're shooting,

1577
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:04,960
they're shielded from anybody ever seen
who they really are. And because of that,

1578
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:05,561
we're like,

1579
01:25:05,561 --> 01:25:08,380
we were talking about celebrities getting
crazy and going nuts because they have

1580
01:25:08,381 --> 01:25:12,800
all this power. It's almost like that's
like the norm. It's like then they need,

1581
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:15,460
they never show you who they really are.

1582
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:20,580
So every calculated interview is carving
out this completely artificial idea of

1583
01:25:21,611 --> 01:25:24,370
who this person is. And he's been
pulling this off. It's called life.

1584
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:27,190
So he probably doesn't even
fucking know who he is anymore.

1585
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:32,140
So when he gets alone and he's wishing
this fucking Russian bitch was over there

1586
01:25:32,141 --> 01:25:33,820
blowing him. So He's like, what?

1587
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,900
You get over here and blow or your job.

1588
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:41,620
That's the real Mel Gibson. That's
the, that's the heart of the beast.

1589
01:25:41,621 --> 01:25:43,870
And that's why people are
like, Dude, you can't act.

1590
01:25:43,871 --> 01:25:45,790
You need to get your shit together.
And people say,

1591
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:48,010
well you shouldn't have to fire
somebody just because he does it.

1592
01:25:48,011 --> 01:25:51,670
He's not getting fired. People just
don't watch her go to his movies anymore.

1593
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:55,890
Used to watch it because he
was cool. Yeah. He's not a
viable commodity. And Yeah,

1594
01:25:56,110 --> 01:26:00,850
when he was mad max, he was the
shit when he was brave heart dude.

1595
01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:04,220
Could you, do you remember how
powerful that fucking movies

1596
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:07,550
and there was another movie that he
directed, right? Mel Gibson in Braveheart,

1597
01:26:07,551 --> 01:26:10,730
the shit. Wow. Mel
Gibson was the shit son.

1598
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,920
It just cause someone's crazy doesn't
mean they can't be good at an art form,

1599
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,990
bro.
I got out of that Braveheart movie.

1600
01:26:14,991 --> 01:26:19,220
I wanted to grab a sword and join the
battle. That movie was incredible.

1601
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,180
It was incredible.

1602
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:25,330
And it ushered in an era of movies where
giant groups of dudes will run at other

1603
01:26:26,391 --> 01:26:29,090
giant dudes who agree to meet on a field.

1604
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:34,190
We did the same movie and called
it the Patriot and it was like they

1605
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,210
just
did it.

1606
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:43,520
A different time period is a shit.
He did Redo the same shit. Yeah.

1607
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:47,140
It was like a mannequin. A mannequin
too. It was like the same mood

1608
01:26:49,810 --> 01:26:53,360
was mannequin the mannequin to both
have the same woman? No different woman.

1609
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:57,510
Only thing the same Hollywood. That black
guy that was like the Gay Black Guy,

1610
01:26:57,950 --> 01:27:01,450
I think it was a comic. The Gay Black
Guy was in the corner that made it.

1611
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:02,370
He made it again,

1612
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:05,450
but it was just a different city
mannequin coming to life again and a guy

1613
01:27:05,451 --> 01:27:09,310
falling in love in a window dressing.
It was like, what is that other stupid?

1614
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:12,230
His premise of all time,
oh,

1615
01:27:12,231 --> 01:27:16,250
some loser is in a store for some reason
after dark and the mannequin comes

1616
01:27:16,251 --> 01:27:17,210
alive and he does.
He,

1617
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:22,240
he doesn't even bone her
movie saw what happened there.

1618
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:26,480
Did they really kiss him?
He's just got a kiss and it wasn't like,

1619
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:29,870
it was like just something that
happens in a movie man. Just kissing,

1620
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:32,390
just kissing happens in movies.
Everybody's happy.

1621
01:27:32,391 --> 01:27:34,330
The dude doesn't date
rape you to have his bit,

1622
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:37,180
but I could never make it work where
it's like where it's like in the movies,

1623
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:40,430
whatever reality cause you go for that
first kiss and beautiful and magical and

1624
01:27:40,431 --> 01:27:42,230
you're like right,
you lean in and I'm dunes out,

1625
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,170
you find the go and you
just kiss for awhile.

1626
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:48,470
Right after that almost every guy it'd
be like you got to go back to my place.

1627
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,220
But they never do that and
that was the kiss the enough.

1628
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:56,000
You want to see how far you could get it.
Some dude's though are careful.

1629
01:27:56,001 --> 01:27:57,260
I know dudes who like,

1630
01:27:57,290 --> 01:28:01,460
especially as they get older and they've
been in a few loony toon relationships,

1631
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:01,971
Dell,

1632
01:28:01,971 --> 01:28:05,760
Dell should go slow with a check to try
to figure out what the fuck's going on

1633
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,630
behind that icing.
You know?

1634
01:28:08,631 --> 01:28:11,720
Cause there's some people that can put
on an awesome show of being a really

1635
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:15,560
special person for a few weeks. Even,
you know when you're dating him,

1636
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:16,970
like this is the greatest person ever.

1637
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:21,890
But then as they get tired of playing
their acts or eventually they order what

1638
01:28:21,891 --> 01:28:25,580
they order at restaurants. If you dive
right in and start banging all the time,

1639
01:28:25,581 --> 01:28:28,580
then the problem is those bitches
are usually a really good in bed.

1640
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:29,840
The crazier they are.

1641
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,690
And I've always said that my
friend Tony Zara says this best,

1642
01:28:32,691 --> 01:28:35,450
he said psychotic and erotic
are next door neighbors.

1643
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,010
The more psychotic that CIC is,
the more erotic they are in bed.

1644
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:44,000
And this motherfucker would purposely
date crazy girls just because he would get

1645
01:28:44,001 --> 01:28:47,750
that rush out of banging
these like incredibly crazy
broads. I just want to bone.

1646
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:49,710
It's like that's gotta be first
and then I can get to know you.

1647
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:50,810
We can have some fun.
Yeah,

1648
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:55,130
but what I'm saying is you gotta be
careful who you connect with because once

1649
01:28:55,131 --> 01:28:58,760
you start fucking a little bit,
you need each other all the time.

1650
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:01,500
No Man,
you need to know.

1651
01:29:01,501 --> 01:29:04,290
You need to be careful who you connect
yourself with in your life. Man,

1652
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:07,410
it's one of the most important things.
I agree. Dude's dive into relationships,

1653
01:29:07,411 --> 01:29:11,550
and I have guilty as charged
cause girls are hot. Oh, you see,

1654
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:14,750
he doesn't do relationships
are see what he wants. He,

1655
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:17,430
but he thinks that that's normal.
That's what's hilarious most.

1656
01:29:17,431 --> 01:29:19,320
Most people get into relationships,
but he's like,

1657
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:22,020
oh no time for the good way for
her to follow her. If a weapon,

1658
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,930
I used to be married showed up,
I've been there.

1659
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:27,540
You can't tell me how to live my life.
Go Away, please. God just seems so bad.

1660
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:30,270
Not Man, it's great when it's great,
but you have to have the right person.

1661
01:29:30,271 --> 01:29:32,320
That's the key. You have
to really, he's got it.

1662
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:35,640
I just don't have any desire by now,
but I got to tell you,

1663
01:29:35,641 --> 01:29:37,830
if I didn't have children,
it wouldn't be nearly as appealing.

1664
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:41,070
And one of the most appealing things
about it is the little babies and this

1665
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:44,100
little connection that you make with
this woman and you have this new life

1666
01:29:44,101 --> 01:29:47,220
together. It's a completely different
trip. But if there's no wimp,

1667
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:48,600
if there's no babies in charge,

1668
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:53,070
then the human animal goes into this
mode of fucking all kinds of different

1669
01:29:53,071 --> 01:29:55,170
things, which is where you're
at right now. And I just,

1670
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,380
I just kind of like my alone time,
but a lot. Well, yeah, you're,

1671
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:00,780
you're also an artist, you
know, and you need weird time.

1672
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:02,490
You can't be on it like a rigid schedule.

1673
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,860
You need time to sit down and
reflect about things like I,

1674
01:30:04,861 --> 01:30:08,770
I think there's an equal part discipline
involved in creating things, but,

1675
01:30:08,771 --> 01:30:09,780
and then life experience.

1676
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:12,810
I think you have to have both to be able
to sit down and write things out and

1677
01:30:12,811 --> 01:30:15,630
you have to, you have to have a work
ethic. I think that's very important.

1678
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:18,960
But you also have to have fun, you know?
I think that that's a part of your job.

1679
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,550
Yeah.
I like to have experiences with women.

1680
01:30:20,551 --> 01:30:23,570
I like to enjoy them and really get to
know them and like them a lot and fuck.

1681
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,050
And it might be different
than pedestrian lights off,

1682
01:30:25,051 --> 01:30:28,010
off to any of those experiences.
Nothing wrong with that dude. Yeah.

1683
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:30,030
Until she starts shitting out kids.

1684
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,730
Then little Ari Juniors run around
the house and you're like, oh my God,

1685
01:30:32,731 --> 01:30:35,760
I don't want to fuck this kid up.
I don't want this kid to be like me.

1686
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:38,500
That's where I get caught up. I don't
want my kid to be a comic. Is there,

1687
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:40,830
there's an Alpine is sure.

1688
01:30:40,831 --> 01:30:45,831
Of course there are black or on some
weird white hair and red resize white

1689
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:48,180
iPhone or they would look like some like,

1690
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:53,400
like snow Ninja robot in a video game.
Yeah. I really have one red eyes today.

1691
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,740
Albinos. Some do they have
red eyes? It sounds like,

1692
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,160
like something in mortal combat.

1693
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:02,850
You know you're playing some Albino
Asians that live in like northern area of

1694
01:31:02,851 --> 01:31:06,620
China. They could ever get away with
making an albino care. Yeah. They could.

1695
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:09,120
Might not represent them.
You know, they found,

1696
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:14,990
they found weed on some Chinese dude
from like some insane amount of thousands

1697
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:17,760
of years ago. I thought an Egyptian tomb.
Was it a Chinese to him? Maybe that too.

1698
01:31:17,761 --> 01:31:19,380
I know they found weed
in Egyptian tombs too,

1699
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:23,820
but they found a Chinese guy with weed
and his stash. He had like a little bag,

1700
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:28,420
really thousands of year old weed,
little Ziploc made everybody lawyers.

1701
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,810
That's the way it smells.

1702
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:34,560
Gross people that are trying to exume
William Shakespeare because they want to

1703
01:31:34,561 --> 01:31:38,130
test his body for cannabis because
they want to test is to luck with that.

1704
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:42,870
I'm going to do, how important
is it to you to prove a point?

1705
01:31:42,871 --> 01:31:45,720
You fuck does this scientists
live in a Volkswagen, if you will?

1706
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:55,470
That was a very funny line.
That was steel opening Anthony's bit.

1707
01:31:55,471 --> 01:31:56,460
That was the line of the day.

1708
01:31:57,530 --> 01:32:00,100
It's so true because when you
think teeth are long gone,

1709
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,560
right?
I mean it's not going to happen.

1710
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:04,750
Say I can see the DNA being
able to test that shit,

1711
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:09,310
but that they're never going to French
medical sciences. Crazy. I got a purse.

1712
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,490
I just got French. You
should watch it. It's fun.

1713
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:15,080
It's why x files.

1714
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,940
William Shakespeare,

1715
01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:21,650
1564 God damn son,

1716
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:26,720
1585 and 1592 we began a successful
career in London as an actor,

1717
01:32:26,721 --> 01:32:29,720
writer and 15 hundreds see,

1718
01:32:29,721 --> 01:32:33,590
that's some shit that you get when you
go to England that you just can't even

1719
01:32:33,591 --> 01:32:36,890
fathom. Here in America.
You can get it a little bit.

1720
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:40,370
If you go to Boston and go on
like one of those little tours,

1721
01:32:40,371 --> 01:32:43,070
it takes you to these houses from
like the 16 hundreds like there's a,

1722
01:32:43,071 --> 01:32:46,700
there's a bunch of really old buildings
that are still around and especially

1723
01:32:46,701 --> 01:32:47,630
tombstones.

1724
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:51,350
There's a bunch of fucking really old
tombstones in Boston that I like from the

1725
01:32:51,351 --> 01:32:54,710
17 hundreds and everything. It's
a really, it's a trip to look at,

1726
01:32:55,280 --> 01:33:00,280
but this is 15 hundreds man and this guy
was out there writing things and then

1727
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:04,300
people would perform what he wrote
in front of a group of people.

1728
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:05,930
There's no microphones,
man.

1729
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:08,100
Here it is. Here it is. He just talking

1730
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:14,110
and they believe apparently that he
was a stoner. I have of course he was.

1731
01:33:14,111 --> 01:33:15,760
I think everybody back then was they

1732
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,860
tested his pipe apparently as this
what I've read on the Internet,

1733
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:25,020
that they apparently tested Shakespeare's
pipe and found residue of the

1734
01:33:25,021 --> 01:33:27,750
marijuana. And why do they want
to test to see if he was doing,

1735
01:33:27,751 --> 01:33:29,340
just to see if he was doing it because,
well,

1736
01:33:29,341 --> 01:33:32,730
because of what we all know that
it enhances creativity. You know,

1737
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:37,530
Carl Sagan wrote a brilliant piece on
marijuana and why he uses marijuana and

1738
01:33:37,531 --> 01:33:39,690
just look up if you want
to find it, just, yeah,

1739
01:33:39,691 --> 01:33:43,650
just look up for the people listening
at home. Carl Sagan, marijuana.

1740
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:48,480
And it was a sort of a lifelong ode
to marijuana and that he was a daily

1741
01:33:48,481 --> 01:33:50,190
cannabis smoker.
Yeah.

1742
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:54,630
And that he said that what he had
learned from marijuana, that there was,

1743
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:58,470
there was some real lessons that
he brought back from that state of

1744
01:33:58,471 --> 01:34:02,880
consciousness that he could
apply to, uh, to other, uh,

1745
01:34:02,910 --> 01:34:07,380
aspects of his life that he could actually
learn things that he believed weren't

1746
01:34:07,381 --> 01:34:10,170
learnable. Like, well, we're,
we're an available to him.

1747
01:34:10,171 --> 01:34:14,250
This thought was not available to him
without cannabis. This is his, his belief.

1748
01:34:14,251 --> 01:34:18,360
And this is, you know, Carl
Sagan is a great mind, a
fascinating person. You know,

1749
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:22,020
a guy who turns so many people
onto cosmology and his, you know,

1750
01:34:22,021 --> 01:34:23,580
his words were so,
you know,

1751
01:34:23,581 --> 01:34:26,160
there's so much of what he said
was so appealing that they've,

1752
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:30,030
they've taken a lot of it and put it on
videos where they show like space and

1753
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:34,380
then he'll be like going on some rant
about the size of the cosmos or some

1754
01:34:34,381 --> 01:34:39,330
incredible yeah. And you know, and there'd
be so hypnotic. So guys like that are,

1755
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:40,860
you know,
and then people will argue with that.

1756
01:34:40,861 --> 01:34:42,660
He wasn't the most
brilliant scientist ever.

1757
01:34:42,661 --> 01:34:44,400
And what did he actually
accomplished is science.

1758
01:34:44,401 --> 01:34:48,140
There was any scientist is smarter
than you. Yeah. For most people. Yeah.

1759
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:49,290
And on top of that,

1760
01:34:49,291 --> 01:34:53,100
like you can't deny his contribution by
getting people excited about astronomy.

1761
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:56,790
You know, people know, I know his name.
How many scientist named do I know? Yeah.

1762
01:34:56,791 --> 01:34:58,480
Jesus Christ. You know, Steven Lock

1763
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:03,220
door. Yeah. I could have made
ted butter. Yeah. There's,

1764
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:05,600
there's not that many men.
This is a small amount.

1765
01:35:05,601 --> 01:35:09,470
So he says he couldn't have done
certain things without his exact quote.

1766
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:10,650
I would bring it buttoned.
Right.

1767
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:14,360
Your version of that is a flying
squirrel posted people. No Way.

1768
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:19,250
I can come up with that without weed.
It's true. I am a, I believe that there's,

1769
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:23,060
there's reasons why all this stuff
is around. That's what I believe.

1770
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:26,030
I believe there's reasons why there's,
you know,

1771
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:28,940
every different substance
that exists on the planet.

1772
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,250
There's reasons why there's
coffee. Beans, I believe does to,

1773
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,360
everything has to be good for you.
There's reasons. No, it's just,

1774
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:39,560
there's things that are terrible for you.
You know, strict nine. There's, there's,

1775
01:35:39,561 --> 01:35:41,780
there's plants that are, that'll
kill you. You eat those plants,

1776
01:35:41,781 --> 01:35:42,530
you'll fucking die.

1777
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:45,920
So what are the reasons for the open
ecosystem is probably not connected to me,

1778
01:35:45,921 --> 01:35:49,130
man. You know? But everything
else that is connected to you,

1779
01:35:49,131 --> 01:35:51,170
you should be aware of.
And when, when someone,

1780
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:54,590
like Carl Sagan tells you that cannabis
connects you to the universe and it

1781
01:35:54,591 --> 01:35:57,890
makes you look at things in a different
light and it makes you, you know,

1782
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:00,920
a more sensitive person, it makes
you more creative. And it, you know,

1783
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:03,080
it's helped him,
I think a million different thoughts.

1784
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:06,110
I think it's easy for people to just blow
off of those people. So like whatever,

1785
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,830
but then it's like, okay, but
think what if a guy was right?

1786
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:12,720
What did he possibly be a scientist
that everyone's heard of? Well, that's,

1787
01:36:12,730 --> 01:36:16,630
see these right people will get upset
at me if I talk about Ponte too much and

1788
01:36:16,631 --> 01:36:18,040
like to,
you're always talking about pot like,

1789
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:19,670
and you need to lay off the pot talk.
Look,

1790
01:36:19,730 --> 01:36:23,990
I'm only telling you this because
it's of benefit. It helps.

1791
01:36:23,991 --> 01:36:27,980
And it's helped me. And I think that if
you just approach it with discipline,

1792
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:30,440
it can be spectacular for your life.

1793
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,230
And I think that what it can do
is that it can enhance your life.

1794
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:36,200
And I really truly believe that,
man,

1795
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:39,383
nothing.
Oh,

1796
01:36:39,430 --> 01:36:42,100
I was just gonna say it. Don't you
love it how people tell you what? No,

1797
01:36:42,101 --> 01:36:44,800
you should not talk about this. You should
not talk about that. I'm like, dude,

1798
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:49,270
listen to us.
Who are you to judge what we talk about?

1799
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:51,880
If you want to listen in to what
we're talking about, listen then,

1800
01:36:51,881 --> 01:36:56,470
but don't think that you have the
control of what they have access.

1801
01:36:56,471 --> 01:36:59,250
But it's like if you had a sitcom or
you're like more Newman or less Newman.

1802
01:36:59,270 --> 01:37:00,730
Yeah. But it's like they're
not gonna listen to you,

1803
01:37:00,731 --> 01:37:02,740
but I can just send you
liking something more or less.

1804
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:05,830
I can understand you're voicing your
opinion and just don't be a Douche bag.

1805
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:10,120
It's all that simple. You
don't have to here. Yeah.

1806
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:12,730
How about Justin Moore, Joey
Diaz and people, you know,

1807
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,350
there's a lot of people to
give Brian a hard a hard

1808
01:37:14,350 --> 01:37:18,970
time. You get, you get a lot of shit on
that message board dude course. And uh,

1809
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:21,430
you know, people don't
appreciate, you know,

1810
01:37:21,431 --> 01:37:25,540
you and I have a very unusual relationship
and I think sometimes people don't

1811
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:28,750
appreciate that.
I think there's a,

1812
01:37:28,751 --> 01:37:31,990
there's a reason for everybody
and there's, there's a,

1813
01:37:31,991 --> 01:37:36,940
a method to having fun and to,
to, to good times. There's a,

1814
01:37:36,941 --> 01:37:39,760
there's a, there's a method to
like keep that ship on track.

1815
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:44,320
And one of the methods with our friends
is that we're all, we're kind of silly,

1816
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:48,880
we're all kind of silly and I go off
and get dark sometimes and I go off on

1817
01:37:48,881 --> 01:37:50,890
weird tangents and I go,
you know,

1818
01:37:50,891 --> 01:37:55,000
I'll go on these strange
rants and apocalyptic ideas
that I take to the fucking

1819
01:37:55,190 --> 01:37:56,550
the ant most degree.
Yeah.

1820
01:37:56,670 --> 01:38:01,110
And then Brian will bring up some ass
spray that he got that he makes people

1821
01:38:01,111 --> 01:38:04,080
stick their finger in and it all sort
of balances out different styles.

1822
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:06,580
It's like, no, I think
everything, you know?

1823
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:14,490
Yeah. So I like Brian, don't be
hating. Stop being so negative online.

1824
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,400
There's certain things you're not going
to like about every fucking show. I,

1825
01:38:17,401 --> 01:38:19,680
I can't, you know, look, I'm a
huge fan of the Howard stern show,

1826
01:38:19,681 --> 01:38:21,790
but everything on that, I'll
change the channel. It does study.

1827
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:24,450
It's just the way it goes. It's taught
me if I said this on the podcast before,

1828
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:27,440
but there's a study that
they did that showed how a,

1829
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:30,630
when you're negative online or whatever
you do online and leads over to your

1830
01:38:30,631 --> 01:38:32,890
regular life. Yeah. So you feel like
I can get it. They go but I want,

1831
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:35,220
nobody even knows me here.
But that kind of behavior,

1832
01:38:35,221 --> 01:38:36,780
that's actual behavior that you're doing,

1833
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,310
you being mean to someone
and so when you're normally,

1834
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:42,000
you just get a little meaner when
you actually see them face to face,

1835
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:43,150
like you're affecting it.

1836
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:46,290
So if it gets super positive online
that'll affect you at the other way.

1837
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:47,010
It's up to you.

1838
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:51,450
You clearly identify yourself with the
way you behave and how your behavior

1839
01:38:51,451 --> 01:38:53,040
affects people.
Even if you only,

1840
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:55,710
it's implied like you know
that if you said some chick,

1841
01:38:55,711 --> 01:38:58,440
I hope you get watched in your current
and your fucking pussy falls out your

1842
01:38:58,441 --> 01:39:02,090
asshole. You sitting there saying, send
her a message on Twitter to [inaudible].

1843
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:03,600
You know,
say it like that.

1844
01:39:03,601 --> 01:39:07,710
Your rip rob nine six two you can
say the most fucked up shit hospital,

1845
01:39:07,711 --> 01:39:10,440
but don't think that you're
getting away with that for free.

1846
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:13,380
Somewhere in the back of your mind you're
going to know that you're a piece of

1847
01:39:13,381 --> 01:39:14,151
shit.
You're going to,

1848
01:39:14,151 --> 01:39:16,680
you're going to define yourself by your
own actions and you're going to also

1849
01:39:16,681 --> 01:39:21,440
think, how would I judge me
if I wasn't me? You know?
Got Great. You're a jerk. Oh,

1850
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:24,220
congratulations. It's not hard to
do that. Anyone can just be a jerk.

1851
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:28,050
Just terrible. Easy. It's very
easy. It's really being an asshole.

1852
01:39:28,051 --> 01:39:30,090
And we evolved all done it.
I have done it. I'm not,

1853
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:34,200
I was clearly an asshole
for a good chunk of my life.

1854
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:38,010
We've all been there. We were, we
were caught up in our own bullshit.

1855
01:39:38,011 --> 01:39:41,520
And sometimes we'll take it out on other
people, but it doesn't mean you're,

1856
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:45,060
you're unfixable. So what we're saying
is not that people are unfixable.

1857
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:48,480
I don't even mind the people in line are
real mean that they would make a joke

1858
01:39:48,481 --> 01:39:51,270
about it because that's gotta be really
funny. It's got to be really funny.

1859
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,400
And it couldn't be,
it shouldn't be something where you just,

1860
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:56,310
you feel like someone's just trying
to take somebody down for no reason.

1861
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:57,960
Like you should have
something funny to say stupid.

1862
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:00,910
And if you don't have something funny to
say, stop being such a cunt, you know,

1863
01:40:00,911 --> 01:40:03,820
like what, what is your issue?
You're, you're creepy man. You're,

1864
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:07,050
you're angry all the time. There's
so many God damn angry people online.

1865
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,510
I view it as a way like
trying to get attention.

1866
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:14,400
It's just like trying to get life in some
way and you see a gazelle when it gets

1867
01:40:14,401 --> 01:40:17,730
killed by like a lion and it's being
held onto or mountain lion or anything,

1868
01:40:17,731 --> 01:40:17,970
you know?

1869
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:20,460
And it'll just like sort of stopped and
the kicks a few more times real quick,

1870
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,110
like just a last ditch effort for those
people are doing that for attention.

1871
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:30,060
So like here's main, yeah,
show me attention. But it
just, if it doesn't work,

1872
01:40:30,061 --> 01:40:32,250
they'll try something else.
It's definitely a lot of that man.

1873
01:40:32,251 --> 01:40:34,110
There's a lot of people
being shit for no reason.

1874
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:37,860
But my experience online is obviously
very different than most people's because

1875
01:40:37,861 --> 01:40:40,380
I always post as myself.
I never,

1876
01:40:40,381 --> 01:40:42,630
I never go on a forum with
some sort of a fake name,

1877
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:45,600
but I have thought about doing it
before just to see like how would I be

1878
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:48,960
accepted in this community? Even
in my own website. I thought like,

1879
01:40:48,961 --> 01:40:51,690
what would I be like if I
was skippy 12 six you know,

1880
01:40:51,790 --> 01:40:53,980
instead of a Rogan cause then everything,

1881
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,380
I'm Joe Rogan and the underground.
I post as Joe Rogan. I'm the,

1882
01:40:56,670 --> 01:40:59,680
the pool side I go to is Joe Roth know
where you're getting a completely honest

1883
01:40:59,681 --> 01:41:02,170
version of of people.
Everybody's nice to me.

1884
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,370
I've ever wanted your
thoughts on the or somewhere.

1885
01:41:04,371 --> 01:41:07,360
It's some comedy club and
someone was like, oh, I heard
that an astral yuck. Yeah,

1886
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:09,370
they were an asshole to me and someone
else like, yeah, and you're like,

1887
01:41:09,371 --> 01:41:11,860
well they'd never been anything
but nice to me. He's like, yeah,

1888
01:41:11,861 --> 01:41:12,820
you're a sellout guy.

1889
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:17,040
It's a nice deal. I wish it were
simulations and things like,

1890
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:21,240
like like life experiences. Like what
if you could just simulate like, hey,

1891
01:41:21,570 --> 01:41:24,180
let's make molestation popular and legal.

1892
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:27,810
Then see how many youtube
comments I was thinking of.

1893
01:41:27,811 --> 01:41:32,220
Let's simulate being a jet fighter pilot
and you're flying through the mountain

1894
01:41:32,221 --> 01:41:33,410
range.
That's what I would like.

1895
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:38,440
I wouldn't want to simulate incest
to fucking Weirdo or comment.

1896
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:40,050
Anger goes up by like,

1897
01:41:40,051 --> 01:41:44,490
it's gross thousand percent don't bring
that shit up when they have those videos.

1898
01:41:44,491 --> 01:41:45,061
But what I'm saying,

1899
01:41:45,061 --> 01:41:48,420
what I'm saying is that that it's almost
like you have to remember half these

1900
01:41:48,421 --> 01:41:51,810
fucking angry people are just young
kids to it and that it, it, it's like,

1901
01:41:52,010 --> 01:41:56,100
like I get so upset with people on Twitter
and message boards and stuff and then

1902
01:41:56,101 --> 01:41:59,040
I got a lot of, oh yeah, this
kid's probably like 12 years old.

1903
01:41:59,041 --> 01:42:02,430
He probably fucking got molested by an
uncle and he's fucking being angry to

1904
01:42:02,431 --> 01:42:05,790
everybody, you know, maybe or you
know, like it just be an asshole.

1905
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:08,790
There's mom wasn't very strong.

1906
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:11,550
Let them get away with a lot when he was
young and I always become a big client

1907
01:42:11,970 --> 01:42:16,050
and he's older. In my head
it's a molester kid. All right.

1908
01:42:18,290 --> 01:42:22,680
Kids molested. He gets Dick on
other, when somebody's mean to me,

1909
01:42:22,681 --> 01:42:24,390
if it wasn't molested a child.

1910
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:29,170
All right, Brian. By the
way, that Tracy Morgan thing,

1911
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,640
we say people will really show
themselves like Mel Gibson,

1912
01:42:31,641 --> 01:42:33,140
like on tape or whatever,
right?

1913
01:42:33,530 --> 01:42:37,490
That's why sports casters and newscasters
love Twitter because they're getting

1914
01:42:37,491 --> 01:42:41,300
an actual feed into the real them so
that like we're, we're countering.

1915
01:42:41,301 --> 01:42:44,570
This is a real new source,
right? You know? Well, it
isn't real news source to them.

1916
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:47,330
So our message boards now,
the stories are written about,

1917
01:42:47,331 --> 01:42:48,760
people say things like message boards,
do it.

1918
01:42:48,770 --> 01:42:51,470
If you were of celebrity and what you
had just said would really get you in

1919
01:42:51,471 --> 01:42:56,150
trouble, let's say if you were celebrity,
somebody could quote you saying,

1920
01:42:56,151 --> 01:42:56,601
yeah,

1921
01:42:56,601 --> 01:43:01,040
this Molesey they're getting disheartened
and how you're laughing about kids

1922
01:43:01,041 --> 01:43:01,874
getting fucked.

1923
01:43:01,950 --> 01:43:05,520
I would have photo ops with black babies,
me kissing black babies,

1924
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:09,300
please stop fucking digging
yourself in trouble.

1925
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:14,030
You heard about that? It was a, he was a
running back for the giants for awhile.

1926
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:17,250
Retired kind of early to be a
sportscaster for a couple of years.

1927
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:20,130
Now he's going back to a football.
So He's in training.

1928
01:43:20,430 --> 01:43:21,510
So before he made this announcement,

1929
01:43:21,511 --> 01:43:25,080
it was like big news to his
agent was hiding him, was like,

1930
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:28,240
you can stay at my place. It was like
some nice, polite, whatever. He goes,

1931
01:43:28,241 --> 01:43:30,250
I got a guiding him. Why?
Because he didn't want anybody,

1932
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:31,380
the media talking to them at all.

1933
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:34,860
It was like he needed to be away from
them for like two weeks. So he's like,

1934
01:43:34,861 --> 01:43:36,630
I got a guest bedroom upstairs,
you can take that.

1935
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:40,200
So he was stuck in an attic and he
goes, Anne, a Jew was keeping him there.

1936
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,900
And he goes, yeah, I kind of
understand what and frank was doing.

1937
01:43:42,901 --> 01:43:45,690
I've got to be stuck up there all the
time and the Uja or whatever it was.

1938
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:49,720
Who'd nodded? Jewish defense league. Maybe
they jumped all over them. Just make it,

1939
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:51,410
yeah, it's like it's making light. It

1940
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:55,400
like it's not making light.
It's using her as an example.

1941
01:43:55,790 --> 01:43:59,120
What's a better example that I'm
stuck in an attic for two weeks.

1942
01:43:59,121 --> 01:44:00,860
I'm a hostage in an attic.
Like,

1943
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:03,200
show me a better example of
that would stand up a line.

1944
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:05,000
And you know what if you said it,

1945
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:07,190
if you were there you could
say it in a heartbeat.

1946
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:09,390
They can get away with it cause it gives
you a character or nothing cause right.

1947
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:11,360
Cause I'm a Jew and no want to
said anything. They can't say shit.

1948
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:15,230
They couldn't say shit. You, you could
totally get away with that. You can.

1949
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:18,710
You got like at least
three giu references.

1950
01:44:18,711 --> 01:44:23,480
I can go pretty deep before anybody gets
upset. No, come on man enough you can go.

1951
01:44:23,481 --> 01:44:25,790
You can get a cheap one in there.
You can get,

1952
01:44:25,791 --> 01:44:29,090
you can get a bunch of them in there.
I'll pick on Jews because you are Jewish.

1953
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:30,650
That's a crazy thing.

1954
01:44:30,651 --> 01:44:33,460
We've always allowed people a nice green
light to make fun of their own kind.

1955
01:44:33,970 --> 01:44:37,700
You know, I could say the most
mean shit about Italians. You know,

1956
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:43,130
housewives. I want to talk about
real housewives of New Jersey.

1957
01:44:43,131 --> 01:44:45,230
I talk about them being savages,

1958
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:50,420
that they are just more
ronic growing thinking apes,

1959
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:52,280
they're savage of the
women are based women.

1960
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,800
Could you imagine if I said
that about black people?

1961
01:44:55,130 --> 01:44:57,350
Could you imagine if I said
what I said about my own people?

1962
01:44:57,351 --> 01:45:00,920
If I just decided to say that about
black people, Holy Shit. I would be,

1963
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:03,710
I would be straight Tracy Morgan and
right now in front of a bunch of black

1964
01:45:03,711 --> 01:45:07,400
people saying, I'm so sorry. I did not
mean that. I was only joking around.

1965
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:09,770
I don't think that you're savages,
but my people,

1966
01:45:09,771 --> 01:45:12,020
I can say you're a fucking savages.
You dirty,

1967
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:15,380
greasy fucking stone cobbler workers,

1968
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:20,190
peasant monkey people.
They're all the same short.

1969
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:25,060
Why savages? I don't know. I do. I
get a free pass. I'm Italian. I can,

1970
01:45:25,090 --> 01:45:27,210
I can tell you for sure.
I know exact grew up with them.

1971
01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:30,800
My grandmother screamed at my fucking
grandfather every day he was alive.

1972
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:35,870
Dow there fucking savages growed
eggplants and monsters eaten beef,

1973
01:45:39,261 --> 01:45:44,150
steak, tomatoes and screaming
at each other monsters.

1974
01:45:44,151 --> 01:45:46,790
If you live there, you'd be a monster
too. He'd be caught right up in that.

1975
01:45:46,791 --> 01:45:49,200
Co Does Zeitgeists of that.
That area is.

1976
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:52,790
There's a reason why that Jersey shore
is a fucking popular show because their

1977
01:45:52,791 --> 01:45:56,840
behavior is so extremely horrible. Whoa.
You're like, what the fuck is going on?

1978
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,970
How common is this? And
you want to know, oh,

1979
01:45:58,971 --> 01:46:01,740
there's a whole goddamn enterprise
of them. There's, there's a,

1980
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:05,540
there's a whole Goddamn crew of people
that live like that, plus worse.

1981
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:09,540
Those are the intellectuals of the Jersey
shore movement. You know those people,

1982
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:11,480
they can handle themselves on television.

1983
01:46:11,481 --> 01:46:13,460
They can go on dancing with the star talk,

1984
01:46:13,461 --> 01:46:16,960
literally don't answer interviews and
Shit. That fucking situation guy, he said,

1985
01:46:16,961 --> 01:46:21,220
God damn genius when it
comes to the Jersey shore,
there's some animals live in,

1986
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:25,220
in that state. Dude, that's a, that's
a savage state of monkey people.

1987
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:29,570
All my relatives, man, they're
savages. I see them. I'm like,

1988
01:46:29,571 --> 01:46:32,300
you people would just here feeding
off of each other. It get out.

1989
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:36,650
Get out now before you kill yourselves.
So over the top,

1990
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:40,130
I'm allowed to say that. Yeah, I
would say that because it's me.

1991
01:46:40,190 --> 01:46:43,610
It's my own relatives called Janet
Jackson Nipple. It's fault two.

1992
01:46:43,611 --> 01:46:46,370
That's when it started, right?
Well, it's already started with Pc.

1993
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:50,010
It started turning a rabbit relative
point. I have a relative that sent me a

1994
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,560
photo of some of my cousins
that I've never met before,

1995
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:58,380
and it's all gold chains, slicked back
hair, and everyone's neck is this wide.

1996
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,680
And everyone's sitting there like this
and they all have gold chains and they're

1997
01:47:01,681 --> 01:47:03,540
all like,
wear their Sunday best suit.

1998
01:47:03,541 --> 01:47:05,850
And it's one of those weird
backgrounds where they get,

1999
01:47:05,851 --> 01:47:09,030
tell them what they went to the mall and
went to this little photograph studios

2000
01:47:09,031 --> 01:47:11,460
where it's like the blue and
white speckled background.

2001
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,990
They're savages hot sandwiches
with their shirts, their gold.

2002
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:19,830
What is that type of the flat la like,
I want to say a leaf,

2003
01:47:19,831 --> 01:47:22,710
some sort of a leaf parsley.

2004
01:47:22,790 --> 01:47:25,680
You know,
I think

2005
01:47:28,730 --> 01:47:33,110
the type of, um, uh, chain
type of gold chain there,

2006
01:47:33,111 --> 01:47:37,430
where that flat, here's the thing,
describing them, hating them. Like,

2007
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:42,120
yes, I would agree with all my, God would
say that those are my God, their melody.

2008
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:43,570
Remember when we meet,

2009
01:47:43,571 --> 01:47:47,800
we always talk about this when me and
you were at the sky bar with Joe and uh,

2010
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:51,250
we're with Brett arthritis in this town.

2011
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:55,200
He just comes out of them and
we're been while you drink good.

2012
01:47:56,910 --> 01:47:59,990
I'm doing price for some reason you
got a lot better. He got better.

2013
01:47:59,991 --> 01:48:03,020
He just doesn't sound like that anymore.
But this was a long time ago.

2014
01:48:03,650 --> 01:48:07,700
He Italians it up really amazing. Super
Italian. Now he'll unbuttoned a short,

2015
01:48:07,701 --> 01:48:11,180
a couple more buttons. I love Brent ours.
We've got to bring him on the podcast.

2016
01:48:11,730 --> 01:48:12,890
I've never had him on here.
No,

2017
01:48:12,891 --> 01:48:16,010
he hasn't been on her grandparents is
awesome too because he'll go off on some

2018
01:48:16,011 --> 01:48:18,050
fucking crazy,
you know when Thomas Jefferson,

2019
01:48:18,051 --> 01:48:20,750
when he originally wrote this and
he'll tell you some shit. You're like,

2020
01:48:20,751 --> 01:48:24,160
what the fuck are you holding me
hostage with this history lesson son,

2021
01:48:24,161 --> 01:48:25,880
the steroid a Superbowl party wants.

2022
01:48:25,881 --> 01:48:28,910
Because if for some reason he got on it
that Irish people in this country had it

2023
01:48:28,911 --> 01:48:33,340
worse than blacks and we're like, oh
my God, whatever you read this report,

2024
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:35,810
we're like,
we didn't stop talking about it.

2025
01:48:35,811 --> 01:48:40,070
And everyone was gone within 10 minutes.
You refuse to give at all,

2026
01:48:40,071 --> 01:48:43,700
and it was like, just shut the fuck.
No one cares. He and I got into it

2027
01:48:43,710 --> 01:48:48,180
once about the Bible, some
crazy rants about the Bible,
and he was like, you know,

2028
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:49,021
it's been proven.

2029
01:48:49,021 --> 01:48:53,730
The factual fact that Jesus did
exist has been proven by scholars.

2030
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:57,300
Fuck, are you talking about he's
fully aware of it now, by the way,

2031
01:48:57,301 --> 01:48:59,850
that everyone says like cotton,
an Ernst black hole.

2032
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:04,590
He's just talking at you, but like
this walked away from him. I'm like,

2033
01:49:04,591 --> 01:49:07,380
I'm not going to argue with you about
this. You, you believe in, what?

2034
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:10,480
Did you even research the history
of the fucking Bible he called?

2035
01:49:10,481 --> 01:49:13,400
He knows how many other versions
of those same stories exist.

2036
01:49:13,401 --> 01:49:16,250
All if you've ever heard of are
like, okay, I get, I don't know.

2037
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:18,050
You're just telling about this
information right now. Hey,

2038
01:49:18,110 --> 01:49:21,200
I saw a documentary and I must ask
you about this because I know that you

2039
01:49:21,201 --> 01:49:22,040
studied the Torah.

2040
01:49:22,041 --> 01:49:25,070
I saw documentary and I've been quoting
this documentary ever since I saw it

2041
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:29,510
where they were talking about ciphering
the Dead Sea Scrolls and the real issue

2042
01:49:29,511 --> 01:49:31,970
is that they know so little deciphering,

2043
01:49:31,971 --> 01:49:35,120
not dead sea scrolls rather than the
old whatever the oldest ancient Hebrew

2044
01:49:35,121 --> 01:49:38,560
version of the Bible is that the,
the real issue was that they,

2045
01:49:38,670 --> 01:49:43,430
they didn't know all of the words that
they can only lost some of them that he,

2046
01:49:43,550 --> 01:49:46,900
they were saying in this documentary that
it was three quarters of the words had

2047
01:49:46,901 --> 01:49:50,650
been, but 25% are still up to debate.
Does that, is that accurate? Well,

2048
01:49:50,651 --> 01:49:51,580
here's what the debate is.

2049
01:49:51,780 --> 01:49:55,480
It's like when you get a word in the
English language and you look at all the

2050
01:49:55,481 --> 01:49:59,020
definitions and you see way
back down, it's like fag, right.

2051
01:49:59,021 --> 01:50:01,120
And met some sticks put
together. Right. Okay.

2052
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:05,070
That is one of the usages of the word.
So if you really do the English language,

2053
01:50:05,071 --> 01:50:06,940
we will be aware of that
usage of the word fag.

2054
01:50:06,970 --> 01:50:11,050
And also the fact that if I get that
also cigarettes like you should know,

2055
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:16,690
but I think a faggot is a bundle of sticks
and that's why they would call a, um,

2056
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:20,140
uh,
like they would call a man who was weak.

2057
01:50:20,141 --> 01:50:24,440
They would call him a faggot because he
was like a woman because he was like, oh,

2058
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:27,760
is that a woman was like a bird.
Yeah. It was like a bundle of sticks.

2059
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,800
Like it was a burden that you would carry,

2060
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:31,780
you would carry this
bundle of sticks around.

2061
01:50:31,970 --> 01:50:34,730
And that's how it started with
calling gay guys. Yes. That's,

2062
01:50:34,731 --> 01:50:37,540
that's the original word.
It's not that you would burn them,

2063
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:40,840
it's that they would be like,
like hard to have around.

2064
01:50:40,841 --> 01:50:42,790
They're very flammable
and they're flamers.

2065
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,480
And then you get words like love
or enthralled or, or, or lust.

2066
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:49,390
They're very disabled. We're absolutely
correctly, cause I don't know,

2067
01:50:49,391 --> 01:50:53,480
I feel like I'm missing something in
my translation of it, but the words,

2068
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,200
they know, they're only sort
of aware of their meetings.

2069
01:50:56,201 --> 01:50:57,850
They're not aware fully of their meetings.

2070
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:00,240
There was a whole thing
about the entomology of it.

2071
01:51:00,241 --> 01:51:03,700
It was correcting people that were saying
that it was because a bundle of sticks

2072
01:51:03,701 --> 01:51:06,640
was easy to light on fire and
they were saying that's not true,

2073
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:10,300
that that is not the uh,
the, the original. Uh,

2074
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:15,250
that's like all the reasons why for 20
as a thing, that's like a part time.

2075
01:51:15,740 --> 01:51:19,180
That's what it's called. For the
CAHSEE unsubstantiated associations,

2076
01:51:19,181 --> 01:51:23,170
it's sometimes claim the modern slang
meaning a developed from the standard

2077
01:51:23,171 --> 01:51:24,820
meaning of Faggot as
to a bundle of sticks,

2078
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:27,100
presumably with reference
to burning at the stake.

2079
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:29,920
Like this was even on
Louis' show and I knew,

2080
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:32,320
I had heard before I saw it on his show.
I was like,

2081
01:51:32,321 --> 01:51:33,850
I don't think that's true anymore.

2082
01:51:33,851 --> 01:51:36,820
I think they mean nothing to say
that people haven't burnt gay people.

2083
01:51:36,821 --> 01:51:39,580
Of course they have, of course, people
doing terrible things to gay people,

2084
01:51:39,730 --> 01:51:42,160
but that the,
just the actual entomology,

2085
01:51:42,161 --> 01:51:46,260
I believe that's the correct word of the
word, is not that it was, it was, it was,

2086
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:50,230
it was a bundle of sticks and that
carrying a bundle of sticks was like

2087
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:54,010
uncomfortable. You know what I'm just
realizing that's why now as you said,

2088
01:51:54,011 --> 01:51:56,590
like you wouldn't say the word retard
or about somebody who had a retard.

2089
01:51:56,591 --> 01:52:00,880
It's Stalin or doubts or whatever
because it would hurt them. Right. I,

2090
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:04,690
I really got to get that word and
the f word out of my, my dialogue.

2091
01:52:05,230 --> 01:52:07,620
The faggot word. Yeah.
Because you don't want to,

2092
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:10,100
you wouldn't say it if
there's a gay guy or as true,

2093
01:52:10,270 --> 01:52:13,120
if somebody is struggling with it and
they hear you say it, it's like, yeah,

2094
01:52:13,121 --> 01:52:14,530
you got to feel worse about yourself.

2095
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:18,120
Yeah. But you know, it's better. I
can think of other words like that.

2096
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:22,740
It's weird because we had, uh, this girl
on, on the desk squad podcasts and her,

2097
01:52:23,010 --> 01:52:23,850
she was talking about how your,

2098
01:52:23,851 --> 01:52:28,851
her younger sister is
a special needs and oh,

2099
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:34,260
just start sounding like hermit for a
second. I get out of my throat anyways,

2100
01:52:34,261 --> 01:52:34,830
but she,

2101
01:52:34,830 --> 01:52:38,550
she caught her retarded and it was her
daughter or her sister and you know,

2102
01:52:38,551 --> 01:52:42,870
that the whole family kind of did and
it was kind of like accepted still.

2103
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:47,410
They still talk color and like
the whatever. Yeah. But listen to,

2104
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:50,240
it's kind of interesting.
Yeah. I would, I would say a,

2105
01:52:50,241 --> 01:52:54,280
I should probably only do it when I'm
calling the word for or actually saying

2106
01:52:54,610 --> 01:52:57,050
right over the word actually
means. Yeah. But only that,

2107
01:52:57,530 --> 01:52:58,970
I think everyone just needs to calm down.

2108
01:52:58,971 --> 01:53:02,120
Just don't obviously don't call
it [inaudible]. The point is,

2109
01:53:02,121 --> 01:53:04,250
what we talked about earlier is that
you don't want someone to feel bad.

2110
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:08,030
People feel bad. Right. And it's like not
that should have to calm down. I should,

2111
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:10,370
I should be able to,
I'm a writer with a better word.

2112
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:15,140
Like we've been talking about the words
and teasing now today. I, you know,

2113
01:53:15,141 --> 01:53:18,700
we've been talking about the words, he
should still be allowed to talk. Oh,

2114
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:22,700
the actual words. If you're
on the stage, you know,

2115
01:53:22,701 --> 01:53:25,100
calling people retards and stuff,
and they had the assured,

2116
01:53:25,110 --> 01:53:26,090
then you don't do that.

2117
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:29,720
Here's, here's the argument against,
here's the argument against it.

2118
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:33,650
The reason why it's closing in the
reason why people are closing in on these

2119
01:53:33,651 --> 01:53:38,651
offensive words is because everyone
can have an impact on a large group of

2120
01:53:38,811 --> 01:53:42,480
people. Now by putting something online,
Twitter and stuff like that, people,

2121
01:53:42,490 --> 01:53:45,240
Twitter, and even this podcast,
you know what we're, we're,

2122
01:53:45,241 --> 01:53:46,400
we're saying on the spot,

2123
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:50,690
you have an impact on a lot more people
than you had before where it was just

2124
01:53:50,691 --> 01:53:55,400
you and your friends in a bar. And you
know, and someone says the n Word Ha,

2125
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:57,020
and you'll laugh.
And that's the end of it.

2126
01:53:57,230 --> 01:54:00,140
But if you say that shit in a
tweet and then put that online,

2127
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:03,440
there's a reason why everybody's closing
in on this shit is because we are

2128
01:54:03,441 --> 01:54:07,910
trying to stop people from lashing out
and causing negative energy and hurting

2129
01:54:07,911 --> 01:54:10,310
people. And even though you feel
like you're not doing anything wrong,

2130
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:13,790
I'm not saying anything wrong,
that the energy behind that,

2131
01:54:13,791 --> 01:54:16,550
what you're doing ultimately
winds up being a negative force.

2132
01:54:16,570 --> 01:54:20,630
I was the lines of making people feel
like shit. So even though like this,

2133
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:24,680
this rush to PC is a bad thing because
there's a lot of people that are just on

2134
01:54:24,681 --> 01:54:25,500
the bandwagon.

2135
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:28,580
They're looking to point a finger at
somebody and the reason why they're upset

2136
01:54:28,581 --> 01:54:31,700
about this is because they have the
license to be upset about this and if it

2137
01:54:31,701 --> 01:54:33,650
wasn't this, there'll be something
else that pissed them off.

2138
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:36,620
They're looking for something to be
mad at and so their take on it is not

2139
01:54:36,621 --> 01:54:39,950
reasonable or it's not, you know,
it's, it's, it's not charitable.

2140
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:43,340
Their take on it is aggressive and they
want you to apologize. They want to win,

2141
01:54:43,341 --> 01:54:44,174
they want to get you.

2142
01:54:44,590 --> 01:54:48,830
It's like half of the fund for them
is getting you to feel like shit.

2143
01:54:48,860 --> 01:54:52,280
But some people will say like, well how
come the blood can use Edward? No camp?

2144
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:55,850
It's like a contest man. There's no
winning or losing it. They shouldn't.

2145
01:54:55,851 --> 01:54:58,610
Maybe use it either, but you don't
want to make someone feel bad. Exactly.

2146
01:54:58,670 --> 01:55:00,530
Exactly what you do and
then fucking go for it.

2147
01:55:00,531 --> 01:55:04,850
I guess it's the reason why it's
all happening. It's all natural.

2148
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:08,270
It's all natural and it's a byproduct
of our integration with each other,

2149
01:55:08,271 --> 01:55:12,380
which is unprecedented with social media
and Twitter and Facebook and you know,

2150
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:13,250
all this shit.
Now.

2151
01:55:13,251 --> 01:55:17,270
The r integration with each other is
deeper than ever before and in response to

2152
01:55:17,271 --> 01:55:18,650
that,
people have gotten more sensitive.

2153
01:55:18,651 --> 01:55:20,480
I think if people wholeheartedly
like all the time,

2154
01:55:20,490 --> 01:55:23,510
use the word Judah mean bargain
like they use to a long time ago,

2155
01:55:23,630 --> 01:55:26,780
don't you be down? I think that would
probably make me at least start,

2156
01:55:26,781 --> 01:55:29,990
like if I heard it at a table next to me,
like I'd be like, uh, no. Okay, I'll come.

2157
01:55:29,991 --> 01:55:31,380
Okay.
It was weird.

2158
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:35,120
I said that in front of a friend once
and he got really bummed out at me.

2159
01:55:35,121 --> 01:55:37,700
I forgot it was Jewish.
I didn't think it was a big deal.

2160
01:55:38,030 --> 01:55:39,820
I wouldn't get bummed out just
because I'm like, oh, Yep,

2161
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:43,230
that's using that as a joke. It's a joke.
People would have thought it was funny,

2162
01:55:43,231 --> 01:55:44,010
but he did not think it

2163
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:46,800
was funny. It was very funny because when
they use it was very sensitive rather.

2164
01:55:46,890 --> 01:55:51,270
Yeah. I said, um, I saw, I just tried to
Jew me down and then after I sat out like,

2165
01:55:51,490 --> 01:55:55,020
oh, like, I'm sorry I shouldn't say
that. He's like, you shouldn't say that.

2166
01:55:55,021 --> 01:55:58,380
Why do you say that you're upset that
you said it because I'm around. I'm like,

2167
01:55:58,381 --> 01:56:00,870
you're right, but you're right.
Also that, I shouldn't say it

2168
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:03,900
so weird to say I'm, I'm the
same way because I, we didn't,

2169
01:56:03,950 --> 01:56:06,600
like I've talked about before we
hit didn't grow about or we didn't,

2170
01:56:06,601 --> 01:56:10,200
I didn't grow up with it like black
people, Asian people, Jewish people,

2171
01:56:10,201 --> 01:56:10,830
all that said we'd like,

2172
01:56:10,830 --> 01:56:14,430
we have one Indian person and he farted
all the time and they had to like pull

2173
01:56:14,431 --> 01:56:17,880
us aside and like know school was
all white mashed potato people. Yeah,

2174
01:56:17,881 --> 01:56:20,730
for the most part. But we weren't
racist like that one Indian guy.

2175
01:56:20,731 --> 01:56:23,430
We were just like kind of more like,
oh, he's different than all of us.

2176
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,160
But it's weird like when
you say the Jewish thing,

2177
01:56:26,161 --> 01:56:30,260
like I didn't know what a Jew was for a
long time. And I used to always say like,

2178
01:56:30,270 --> 01:56:31,740
don't be a Jew or be Jewish,

2179
01:56:31,741 --> 01:56:34,110
but I didn't know you didn't even
know what it meant and what I meant.

2180
01:56:34,140 --> 01:56:38,640
I thought it was a term. How old were
you at 40 I'm coming like 1312 you know,

2181
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:41,340
I used to use it as a term.
I didn't know what Jews were.

2182
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:45,580
I was like some Jew hearing that and know
being a little idea that we're feeling

2183
01:56:45,581 --> 01:56:47,300
a weird, can you imagine
though, if they were on,

2184
01:56:47,410 --> 01:56:51,030
if some 12 year old kid heard next
at the table, so yeah, absolutely.

2185
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:53,160
Might feel weird. Absolutely. Faggot.

2186
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:56,830
Retard does to someone who
knows those people. Yup. Yeah,

2187
01:56:57,930 --> 01:57:01,520
it is. It is the same shit. And until
we can get rid of fags and retard,

2188
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:06,250
so what we're saying is rotten them
off. Not My fault. This, listen,

2189
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,990
these are just jokes. Ladies and
gentlemen. You do not feel this way.

2190
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,050
I thought we were on.
No.

2191
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:14,640
Ultimately,
I think we're,

2192
01:57:14,641 --> 01:57:17,760
we're both right about this because
what we're saying is that we know,

2193
01:57:17,761 --> 01:57:19,230
and what I said earlier,

2194
01:57:19,231 --> 01:57:22,830
that if someone was around me and I knew
that they had a child and the child,

2195
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:25,380
I wouldn't say that word.
So really,

2196
01:57:25,381 --> 01:57:27,810
I probably just shouldn't say that word
because there just going to move people

2197
01:57:27,811 --> 01:57:29,460
around you that you don't know.

2198
01:57:29,550 --> 01:57:33,000
I should come up with a word that I use
in response or in replacement like idiot,

2199
01:57:33,150 --> 01:57:36,450
but the, you know, but then
people will rage up and
they'll say, no man, fuck that.

2200
01:57:36,451 --> 01:57:39,120
We're losing all our words,
man. Don't give up retard too,

2201
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:41,820
but don't stop retard too. It's
like, yeah, let's stop it. It's okay

2202
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:45,760
man. I thought I made up that word earlier
that I use. I don't want to use now.

2203
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:49,260
I didn't know that, that you guys all,
it was a real word, but you shouldn't.

2204
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:53,320
Cute man. No, no, no. I'm being
serious. I'm being serious.

2205
01:57:53,321 --> 01:57:55,780
How could you make up that word? You've
heard that word of her. Maybe I have.

2206
01:57:55,781 --> 01:57:58,070
Maybe I have,
but I would call my cats that I,

2207
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:02,050
and I think it's just a funny sounding
word that's based off a bad word,

2208
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:04,910
but I didn't know that
actually people use the shop.

2209
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:09,380
Shut the fuck up, let it go, let
it go, let it go. Shut the fuck up.

2210
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:14,060
They would have this note when you go
into a black going to chant is going to be

2211
01:58:14,061 --> 01:58:17,180
jail. Eventually he say
something bad about black people.

2212
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:18,830
They're going to be able to
take that clip and then you go,

2213
01:58:18,831 --> 01:58:20,490
this motherfucker needs 30 days.

2214
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:24,340
That really they're going to have you 30
days locked up for crimes against black

2215
01:58:24,341 --> 01:58:28,510
folks. What people did, it's
like, you know when you do
any sort of a sexual thing,

2216
01:58:28,511 --> 01:58:31,660
like if you get caught peeing outside
and it's like within a hundred yards,

2217
01:58:32,260 --> 01:58:36,070
you're on the APP. You could be a
sex offender on the APP forever.

2218
01:58:36,350 --> 01:58:37,840
So that's what's going to happen with you.

2219
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:42,070
Trying to think of other
words you get and they put

2220
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:45,460
you in a crimes against
black category in jail.

2221
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:48,340
So just like someone who
goes to jail for sex crimes,

2222
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:53,020
some shit thing by accident. My mom says
I'm about luck. When I was little, little,

2223
01:58:53,021 --> 01:58:55,960
I was like, look, schmuck. I was trying
to imitate like daffy duck. Right?

2224
01:58:55,990 --> 01:58:57,280
And she's like, don't
use that word. I'm like,

2225
01:58:57,570 --> 01:58:59,950
there's Glauco weird Jewish thing
that we're not allowed to talk about.

2226
01:58:59,951 --> 01:59:02,890
What is schmuck mean exactly,
but it's like,

2227
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:05,560
it's an app that the other day talk
soccer. It's like it's just an insole.

2228
01:59:05,561 --> 01:59:08,700
It doesn't mean exactly what it means.
The new about schmuck is that.

2229
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:10,870
That's something that Lenny
Bruce used to use all the time.

2230
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:13,780
We used to turn the schmuck if the
Schmuck, it's like a, it's like a sort of,

2231
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:16,990
it's not that harsh and Jewish homes.
I got in trouble, they bastard,

2232
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:21,640
but really my mom wanted me and my mom
pulled me aside because I was you playing

2233
01:59:21,641 --> 01:59:25,510
Atari 2,600 I'm like, die, you
bastards. She goes, Whoa, what the,

2234
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:29,740
that's a bad word. Where I fuck you
can't say that Brian. Wow. You know,

2235
01:59:29,741 --> 01:59:32,180
and fear factor. It used to be
able to say hell and I can't.

2236
01:59:32,230 --> 01:59:36,070
Then somewhere along the line hell became
a bad word while we were doing fear

2237
01:59:36,071 --> 01:59:39,490
factor because at the end of the day have,
after we're all done with the stunts,

2238
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:41,230
I, Brian, congratulations.

2239
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:44,290
Let's get the hell out of here and I
would leave it and people started writing

2240
01:59:44,291 --> 01:59:47,410
letters or you shouldn't bring up David
writing letters saying that I shouldn't

2241
01:59:47,411 --> 01:59:52,411
be talking about the imaginary place
where everybody burns and fire because we

2242
01:59:52,481 --> 01:59:56,170
don't want people thinking about how
while we're watching our nice TV show,

2243
01:59:56,320 --> 02:00:00,170
he's up there cussing
you. He, he said, hell,

2244
02:00:00,370 --> 02:00:03,790
I remember when I lived in Florida too.
They would say that that hell was a cost

2245
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:09,400
cross hockey days. H E
double hockey sticks. Yeah.

2246
02:00:09,401 --> 02:00:13,600
Hell was a curse. How fucking dumb or
that's amazing that it was okay then.

2247
02:00:13,601 --> 02:00:16,720
It wasn't just like South Park where
they showed Mohamad and they shut it.

2248
02:00:16,721 --> 02:00:17,710
We can't show you episode,

2249
02:00:17,711 --> 02:00:19,780
but we'll show you an old episode
that we were allowed to show them on.

2250
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:24,220
We'll just block them out. What
the fuck? It's like things,

2251
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:26,890
but it's all the interconnectivity.
That's what it is.

2252
02:00:27,730 --> 02:00:30,730
Things are becoming only people are
becoming more and more sensitive.

2253
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:31,830
They're aware and I always,
yeah,

2254
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:35,260
I always feel like that's probably a
natural cycle. I think there's less,

2255
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:35,831
you know how people,

2256
02:00:35,831 --> 02:00:38,200
like you say like people from Pittsburgh
or like this and people from Boston and

2257
02:00:38,201 --> 02:00:40,900
like this. I think with the
Internet, with TV especially,

2258
02:00:41,590 --> 02:00:42,990
there's less and less of that,
right?

2259
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:46,780
Because you're exposed to more and
more things as the world is, you know,

2260
02:00:47,170 --> 02:00:49,240
so you don't have to have it.
This kind of accent you don't have,

2261
02:00:49,270 --> 02:00:52,270
you can see other forms,
but except when laws are applied,

2262
02:00:52,271 --> 02:00:54,370
like California pot laws are
different than somewhere else.

2263
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:56,860
Did you ever look at someone that's
doing something like someone,

2264
02:00:56,861 --> 02:01:00,220
there's a surgeon or something that's
incredibly difficult and you go, okay,

2265
02:01:00,221 --> 02:01:02,770
what if I just started all over?

2266
02:01:02,771 --> 02:01:05,230
How long would it take
before I could be this guy,

2267
02:01:05,670 --> 02:01:09,880
this 50 year old dude who
specializes in replacing, you know,

2268
02:01:10,370 --> 02:01:11,440
fuck a lot of work.

2269
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:16,560
Nick neck spacers know one of those
dudes that fixes bulging discs with

2270
02:01:16,661 --> 02:01:17,880
artificial spacers.
Like,

2271
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:20,950
like what if you had to go starting
from about all the training with tech

2272
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:24,400
fucking Amen. Do you ever think
about like live in someone's life?

2273
02:01:24,401 --> 02:01:29,050
Like how difficult it is to get to him
to get to be who the fuck you are at 50

2274
02:01:29,051 --> 02:01:31,780
or 40 or whatever the fuck you are.
You know,

2275
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:34,120
like if you had to start all
over and go from scratch,

2276
02:01:34,420 --> 02:01:38,320
that's probably the most terrifying
thought about the universe. What is that?

2277
02:01:38,321 --> 02:01:40,220
What it, what this all is, is some

2278
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:45,050
endless cycle that just keeps continuing
over and over again and you live this

2279
02:01:45,051 --> 02:01:47,750
life over and over and over again.

2280
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:52,760
Imagine till you get it absolutely right
until every step of the way you do the

2281
02:01:53,811 --> 02:01:57,110
right thing every time you receive
enlightenment and then you move on to the

2282
02:01:57,111 --> 02:02:00,000
next stage of existence.
But that is one of the, uh,

2283
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:03,010
the idea is attached to eastern
mysticism that this, this,

2284
02:02:03,110 --> 02:02:07,190
there is a possibility that this life
will be repeated until you get it correct.

2285
02:02:08,290 --> 02:02:11,680
Which is a pretty fascinating, you know,
you just keep trying over and over again.

2286
02:02:12,570 --> 02:02:17,090
The same eastern religious character
that said enlightenment is achievable in

2287
02:02:17,091 --> 02:02:18,200
this deck in this lifetime,

2288
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:21,950
that it is possible to
achieve enlightenment in this
lifetime, but you have to,

2289
02:02:22,190 --> 02:02:24,570
you have to get to a state
where I want to get along.

2290
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:28,560
You gotta be perfect for like 20 minutes.
Like what are we talking about?

2291
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:31,850
Is there a certain shit that you did
like that you can never recover from?

2292
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:35,300
You know, how much can you bounce back
from? I think when people say things like,

2293
02:02:35,330 --> 02:02:37,740
like those people just have to calm them
down. Like about people liking them,

2294
02:02:37,820 --> 02:02:40,850
whatever. Like those people are getting
too crazy about racing or a piece they,

2295
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:43,400
I think that's just like we didn't grow
up around them and we don't understand

2296
02:02:43,401 --> 02:02:48,310
their expanse, so they'll look well
I would never be racist against both.

2297
02:02:48,630 --> 02:02:52,850
In the Midwest of course it's both because
the hate that all these other people

2298
02:02:52,851 --> 02:02:53,684
jump in,

2299
02:02:53,930 --> 02:02:57,200
jump in hate where something happens
and someone like Tracy mark and says

2300
02:02:57,201 --> 02:03:00,630
something and everyone decides to
be angry at Tracy Morgan. There's,

2301
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:05,420
there's a bandwagon stuff and stuff.
Is it direct imbalance to it?

2302
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:09,440
It seems to me like some
piling on bullshit and that's
what I don't like about

2303
02:03:09,441 --> 02:03:11,930
it. And that's what everybody is
railing against. And they say,

2304
02:03:11,931 --> 02:03:15,560
fuck all this piece. He Shit
because they're railing at
all these self righteous.

2305
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:19,850
He fucking Prius driving cigarette
thrown out the window con I would say no,

2306
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:21,260
you shouldn't say these things,

2307
02:03:21,290 --> 02:03:25,430
but you shouldn't be put on a steak
when you say exactly. It's like relax.

2308
02:03:25,431 --> 02:03:28,130
The punishment shouldn't be that hard.
Dot. I was asked to get fire forever.

2309
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:31,070
We should decide. Yeah,
don't listen. Right.

2310
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:34,490
I don't like hearing those words and we
should describe what we find offensive

2311
02:03:34,491 --> 02:03:37,880
about them and debate it and sit down
and talk about it reasonably like human

2312
02:03:37,881 --> 02:03:41,210
beings. And you know, if a guy fucks up
and said something on stage like that,

2313
02:03:41,211 --> 02:03:42,050
it's different between,

2314
02:03:42,350 --> 02:03:44,690
there's a difference between that and
the guy actually going out and stabbing

2315
02:03:44,691 --> 02:03:45,321
some gay people.

2316
02:03:45,321 --> 02:03:47,930
Well that obviously is a criminal and
you got to remove them from society.

2317
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:50,580
He's a danger. You're like, I'm in
jail fighting and rewriting some words.

2318
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:53,090
Just like come on. Yeah,
but, but to, to say it,

2319
02:03:53,091 --> 02:03:57,980
you've got to somehow or another you got
to let him know peaceably and in a more

2320
02:03:57,981 --> 02:04:00,440
enlightened place then he's coming from,
you've got to,

2321
02:04:00,441 --> 02:04:02,480
or from a more enlightened place,
you got to let him know, hey man,

2322
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:05,340
this is what's wrong with what you're
doing. And then once he just saw,

2323
02:04:06,290 --> 02:04:08,600
once he acknowledges that and he
steps forcing it talks about it, look,

2324
02:04:08,601 --> 02:04:11,240
I'm just onstage. I'm sorry. It's
okay. We accept it. We move on.

2325
02:04:11,241 --> 02:04:15,890
But all his extra piling on all those
people that are just railing and forth and

2326
02:04:15,891 --> 02:04:19,340
it's become like this main focus
of their life for a few weeks.

2327
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:22,170
Those people are comments.
Those are all cons. Like I said,

2328
02:04:22,171 --> 02:04:23,330
it was problem in Israel when I,

2329
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:26,330
when we talked about explaining to
your non religious friends what you've

2330
02:04:26,331 --> 02:04:28,460
discovered about Judaism
or whatever and you're,

2331
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,920
you're sort of not judging the same scale.

2332
02:04:30,921 --> 02:04:33,530
If you weren't raised with
being orthodox Jewish,

2333
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:36,350
you were raised as conservative and so
you don't think you have to get kosher

2334
02:04:36,351 --> 02:04:38,190
outside.
Do we didn't finish

2335
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:42,710
that, that thought about, you were
talking about, um, the differences in,

2336
02:04:42,711 --> 02:04:46,020
in the words. Oh yeah. It's the nuances.
They don't fully understand it. Okay.

2337
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:48,960
The worst three always means
tree, let's just say. Okay.

2338
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:53,240
But the word love can mean a lot of like
slightly different things depending if

2339
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:57,690
you use the word love or if you use the
word, um, and Namor mint, I don't know.

2340
02:04:57,750 --> 02:04:59,790
So whenever there's a debate,
like,

2341
02:04:59,791 --> 02:05:02,520
so if they say three quarters of the
words in ancient Hebrew have been

2342
02:05:02,521 --> 02:05:05,340
translated,
but the other 24 are still up for debate.

2343
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:08,160
The debate is based on a bunch of
things that were really similar.

2344
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:11,680
They know it could be one of these
things. I love hamburgers. They're like,

2345
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:16,140
does that mean that he's, that he has a
lust for hamburgers or I hate Mondays,

2346
02:05:16,190 --> 02:05:18,980
right? There's a slightly different
use to describe your Dick and new,

2347
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:23,400
we understand those slight differences.
They're still trying to understand them,

2348
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:25,460
right? So they get that. It
means something positive.

2349
02:05:25,461 --> 02:05:28,770
Like love would mean something positive.
But I don't quite know how positive.

2350
02:05:29,370 --> 02:05:32,660
Like, you remember when Russell
Peters told us that, uh, he, uh,

2351
02:05:32,670 --> 02:05:36,300
someone told him that he the, oh
it's the Mondays. And he was like,

2352
02:05:36,301 --> 02:05:39,450
what the fuck does that mean? I'm
using that all the time. I love it.

2353
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:41,470
Russell Peters was talking
about some guy understanding,

2354
02:05:41,471 --> 02:05:45,060
understand about the Monday Mondays, you
know, the Mondays go there and he goes,

2355
02:05:45,061 --> 02:05:48,270
what's the Mondays and the guy who was
black people, oh, I've never heard that.

2356
02:05:48,271 --> 02:05:52,940
He goes, yeah, he goes, he goes, cause
nobody likes Mondays. Oh. And so we were

2357
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:59,430
how they were like, Oh shit. And so
now, once that's out there, you know,

2358
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:04,200
out in the lexicon, you know, if you wrote
something in the blog, you know, like Oh,

2359
02:06:04,201 --> 02:06:06,160
and then we went to the club
and they're with a Monday,

2360
02:06:06,690 --> 02:06:08,610
then it would make sense
because otherwise you'd be like,

2361
02:06:08,611 --> 02:06:12,270
what the fuck are you talking about? So
that shit was in the Bible. Oh look there.

2362
02:06:12,271 --> 02:06:15,260
And went to the, we went to the
desert and it's filled with Mondays.

2363
02:06:15,261 --> 02:06:18,800
Like the fuck did they mean by that?
They meant a Syrian.

2364
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:20,570
It's nobody wants to hang
out with those people.

2365
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:23,490
Was this homeless person sleeping in the
other day and I was with my girlfriend.

2366
02:06:23,491 --> 02:06:27,630
I'm like, oh, look, a Monday fell
down. Oh Dude. That's just like,

2367
02:06:27,690 --> 02:06:30,090
what the fuck are you talking to,
man? You'd go to the wrong place.

2368
02:06:30,091 --> 02:06:34,170
Brian actually had no idea what it went
to the wrong place. You actually used it.

2369
02:06:34,190 --> 02:06:37,770
All right? Who's Day fell
down? Don't do it. Don't do it.

2370
02:06:38,550 --> 02:06:41,640
Don't try to defend yourself, son.
You're not bright enough for this job.

2371
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:45,570
You're going to hurt your career. It
can hurt your future. You're lucky.

2372
02:06:45,571 --> 02:06:50,250
You're lucky you start him. It's
all been achieved on a podcast.

2373
02:06:50,610 --> 02:06:52,720
It's you to have a fake image too,

2374
02:06:52,820 --> 02:06:55,110
of like someone who was like
wholesome Christian first one.

2375
02:06:55,111 --> 02:06:57,660
You're not those people
that read the news.

2376
02:06:57,810 --> 02:07:01,410
I always look at girls that read the
news and they turned me on whenever I see

2377
02:07:01,411 --> 02:07:03,300
pitches, read the news
because I know, first of all,

2378
02:07:03,301 --> 02:07:06,000
they're not creatively fulfilled and
they're probably bored and they're looking

2379
02:07:06,001 --> 02:07:08,900
for things to do so they're probably
just thinking about Dick. You know,

2380
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:11,160
whenever I read,
see some chick or reading the news,

2381
02:07:11,161 --> 02:07:15,420
I read that girl's probably just behind
the scenes is just a fucking freak.

2382
02:07:15,421 --> 02:07:18,780
She's probably freak tastic you know,
she's all buttoned down,

2383
02:07:18,810 --> 02:07:22,620
acting all unnatural and that TV show
for 90 minutes every day. Listen,

2384
02:07:22,621 --> 02:07:24,100
there's some give and take to this world.

2385
02:07:24,101 --> 02:07:26,580
There's a yin and a Yang and
if you get it up all day,

2386
02:07:26,581 --> 02:07:29,130
you got to Yangon up all night. You know
what I'm talking about? What the fuck?

2387
02:07:29,131 --> 02:07:30,780
Cock sucker. Fuck yeah. What I'm saying,

2388
02:07:30,781 --> 02:07:34,440
that was a total Joey Diaz logic moment
and I'm saying this Yin and Yang,

2389
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:39,160
you fucking unit ended up all day with
that fucking suit on Yang it down at

2390
02:07:39,161 --> 02:07:42,760
night, right dog. And he would go like
that. He make you touch, knock right dog,

2391
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,710
right. To understand what
you're talking about. The yes,

2392
02:07:44,711 --> 02:07:48,160
but I'm not positive and you're
like, I'm, yeah, yeah, that sort of,

2393
02:07:48,170 --> 02:07:50,740
but I couldn't explain it.
I let him talk about anything.

2394
02:07:50,741 --> 02:07:54,430
He doesn't have to make sense. Every now
and then I asked for some clarification,

2395
02:07:54,431 --> 02:07:57,190
but if you don't even have to do that,
you know what I'm talking about bro?

2396
02:07:57,280 --> 02:08:00,880
The Meat Sandwich at fucking that Deli
in Philly, right? Dog. You remember that,

2397
02:08:00,881 --> 02:08:05,020
right? What does that mean and
just go, it doesn't really matter.

2398
02:08:05,021 --> 02:08:07,110
It doesn't matter.
It's Joey Diaz colloquially

2399
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:12,930
just pollution will be this
Friday night joining us in Vegas.

2400
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:13,900
I'm really excited for this show.

2401
02:08:13,901 --> 02:08:16,180
That was so good last time
and taken a road trip there.

2402
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:20,260
Shazamm are you going to drive you
crazy answer cause I think it might look

2403
02:08:20,261 --> 02:08:23,380
around with the salt mines and stuff
also. He's the salt and see. Yeah.

2404
02:08:23,620 --> 02:08:27,110
Well we're going to do that
podcast. Got killed. Police

2405
02:08:29,350 --> 02:08:32,890
killed and eaten. I just want to
check it out. Yeah, I like road trips.

2406
02:08:32,891 --> 02:08:34,420
Then we're going to do this.

2407
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:36,970
We've talked about this yesterday and
we're going to do this and Ari's down to,

2408
02:08:37,330 --> 02:08:38,163
we're going to drive,

2409
02:08:38,290 --> 02:08:41,230
we're going to take my truck and we're
all going to pile into the truck and

2410
02:08:41,231 --> 02:08:43,900
we're going to drive out the salt and
seat and we're going to make a video and

2411
02:08:43,901 --> 02:08:46,590
we're going to film it and then we're
going to do a podcast from out there at

2412
02:08:46,591 --> 02:08:50,080
the salt and say, I just think that'd
be an awesome thing to do. Sit down.

2413
02:08:50,081 --> 02:08:52,840
Maybe we'll get a shave motel room
up there. How about a good one?

2414
02:08:53,350 --> 02:08:56,950
I don't think there are any.
There might not be one and a gun.

2415
02:08:57,010 --> 02:08:59,740
Let's find that gun. The pest, I
don't want to say I'm bringing a gun,

2416
02:09:00,970 --> 02:09:02,380
but I'm bringing a gun. Is it? It goes to,

2417
02:09:02,381 --> 02:09:05,800
but there's still places nearby
there just in case in Saturday,

2418
02:09:05,801 --> 02:09:09,610
like Joshua tree where it's like Eddie
Bravo says there's 400 people live in

2419
02:09:09,611 --> 02:09:12,520
there. I have not researched that
so I'm just repeating what he said.

2420
02:09:12,521 --> 02:09:16,210
But that John Waters a documentary
right there. Plagues, what does it say?

2421
02:09:16,230 --> 02:09:19,510
The bottom one plagues and lakes and
pleasures. On the salt on city. Yeah.

2422
02:09:19,511 --> 02:09:23,530
Well I'm going to watch that tonight.
I want to, I want to go there.

2423
02:09:23,531 --> 02:09:24,364
One experiences,

2424
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:28,540
it sounds incredibly bizarre
and apparently it's like
a post apocalyptic world

2425
02:09:28,541 --> 02:09:33,541
surrounded by an outpost of just a few
hundred stragglers that decide to live

2426
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:36,250
near this crazy lake that's like ultra,

2427
02:09:36,251 --> 02:09:40,090
ultra salty and has mass fist die offs
and we're going to be getting there in

2428
02:09:40,091 --> 02:09:42,670
the summer. So probably there'd
be a bunch of fish die offs. Oh,

2429
02:09:42,710 --> 02:09:44,380
it keeps happening. Yeah, every year.

2430
02:09:44,410 --> 02:09:46,300
But I thought they millions
of them die every year.

2431
02:09:46,301 --> 02:09:50,750
Whole place smells like dovish.
A lot survive. Yes. That's like,

2432
02:09:51,070 --> 02:09:53,530
apparently there's like 10
million fish in this lake,

2433
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:56,170
but every like couple of years
a million of them will die.

2434
02:09:56,690 --> 02:09:59,190
It's probably like nothing's
getting new ones in there though.

2435
02:09:59,290 --> 02:10:01,750
It's probably like we're going to be
at this shitty hotel and we're probably

2436
02:10:01,751 --> 02:10:05,140
like five minutes and going,
okay, this was a really bad
idea. Why the fuck are we?

2437
02:10:05,141 --> 02:10:08,250
You know, we'll be like,
we're going to tie cancer.

2438
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:13,600
One of the reasons why I want to go there
is because I want to have like I want

2439
02:10:13,601 --> 02:10:18,601
to internalize the idea that things
can completely fall apart and you can,

2440
02:10:18,791 --> 02:10:23,791
you can see it like within a lifetime and
the salt and seeing the 1950s was this

2441
02:10:23,951 --> 02:10:28,951
incredible resort inland and now here we
are visiting in 2011 barely a lifetime

2442
02:10:30,311 --> 02:10:34,350
being only three quarters of a lifetime
later and there's nothing. It's,

2443
02:10:34,351 --> 02:10:38,240
it's crazy. It's odd that lift it
have been like 2025 and gone like, oh,

2444
02:10:38,241 --> 02:10:40,910
it's a fun place to go on the sound
of the winter or whatever. Yeah.

2445
02:10:41,230 --> 02:10:44,660
It's the amazing thing to be. When you
see places like that you can see scale,

2446
02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:47,480
you can find the understand how big
they are in relation to you and your own

2447
02:10:47,481 --> 02:10:50,960
eyes as opposed to pictures. We're
sort of guessing. Right, right, right.

2448
02:10:50,961 --> 02:10:53,150
You got to go there and see it.
The Coliseum.

2449
02:10:53,210 --> 02:10:57,230
I don't really understand quite where
I would be in a scale model of that.

2450
02:10:57,231 --> 02:10:58,580
How small it would be.
Well,

2451
02:10:58,581 --> 02:11:01,880
I think you get to see that because you
see cars driving around the coliseum,

2452
02:11:01,881 --> 02:11:05,780
which is so strange. Like the,
they put the road right next to it.

2453
02:11:05,990 --> 02:11:08,900
Like the Colosseum in Rome. Yeah.
The fucking road is like right there.

2454
02:11:08,990 --> 02:11:12,950
So people are just driving right by the
coliseum and was going to collapse one

2455
02:11:12,951 --> 02:11:16,850
day. Like a bridge. Oh my God. Humble
people think so man. It's pretty bad acid.

2456
02:11:16,851 --> 02:11:17,750
It's lasted this long.

2457
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:21,770
You're at the Mandalay Bay theaters
are still tickets and everything.

2458
02:11:21,771 --> 02:11:23,750
Like there's some, there's
some, but it's going quick.

2459
02:11:23,751 --> 02:11:26,480
We would put it on the Twitter and yeah,
it's going to be sold out last time.

2460
02:11:26,780 --> 02:11:29,510
Why is it that shit? Oh my God, he's
gonna. It's gonna be a good time.

2461
02:11:29,540 --> 02:11:32,300
It's going to be crazy ideas. Had One of
the best sets I've ever seen last time.

2462
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:37,010
Yeah. Well he's, Joey is a rise to the
occasion type of motherfucker. And when,

2463
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:38,690
you know,
when there's a giant crowd,

2464
02:11:38,691 --> 02:11:41,780
like Joey deals will throw it out and he
fucking threw down in Pittsburgh. Dude.

2465
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:46,670
God Damn, he fucking destroyed
in Pittsburgh. He's so crazy.

2466
02:11:47,030 --> 02:11:50,270
He's so crazy. And he's always doing
new shit and it's always like just he's,

2467
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:54,170
he's a 15 minutes of fury
type of comedian and he'll,

2468
02:11:54,330 --> 02:11:58,300
he'll stretch it out for 30. I'll kill
pace himself, you know more. But those,

2469
02:11:58,310 --> 02:12:00,020
those 15 minutes of fury sets,

2470
02:12:00,021 --> 02:12:03,230
there's not a fucking human alive that
can fuck with Joey Diaz when he's in full

2471
02:12:03,231 --> 02:12:07,610
clown. When he's red in the
face and sweating, you know,
just still going to hell.

2472
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,500
You're going to hell the fuck are you?
You know,

2473
02:12:12,410 --> 02:12:13,440
he'll be there.
Uh,

2474
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:17,110
Doug Benson is going to stop in and do a
guest set and then everybody's going to

2475
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:19,550
be at the UFC the next day
cause it's going to be the shit.

2476
02:12:19,551 --> 02:12:23,450
It's an office or Saulteaux. Ralphie
may be across town, like the duties.

2477
02:12:23,451 --> 02:12:26,920
Ralphie may follow new, everybody's
going to be in Vegas. This is crazy.

2478
02:12:26,930 --> 02:12:30,380
This weekend Ralphie may was just to
believe that he was a Pittsburgh while we

2479
02:12:30,381 --> 02:12:34,040
were in Pittsburgh. We got offstage at
art show, signed a bunch of autographs,

2480
02:12:34,041 --> 02:12:37,910
took a bunch of pictures for like an hour
and then went to Ralphie show and hung

2481
02:12:37,911 --> 02:12:41,600
out with Ralphie there. That's cool. Yeah,
we went to watch Ralphie and you know,

2482
02:12:41,601 --> 02:12:43,820
um, there's uh, who else
is going to be there?

2483
02:12:43,850 --> 02:12:47,540
Sam Aaa Naughty show at that strip club.
This club is awesome.

2484
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:51,560
Uh, fuck I to go there bro.
And girls and Milligan.

2485
02:12:51,590 --> 02:12:53,870
It's like sapphires or something.
Something like that. Yes. Sapphire,

2486
02:12:53,871 --> 02:12:57,800
I might have just made something up.
Got Some company cause some other place.

2487
02:12:57,830 --> 02:13:02,820
Their, their um, their attendance.
It's a treasures treasure.

2488
02:13:02,870 --> 02:13:05,600
That's right. Don't go to south
or do, maybe it's awesome.

2489
02:13:05,601 --> 02:13:08,090
I don't want to be a hater
treasures is where Sam shuffle,

2490
02:13:08,091 --> 02:13:11,960
who's going to be though, so we're going
to be, we're going to be Friday night,

2491
02:13:11,961 --> 02:13:15,500
Mandalay bay 9:00 PM show nine.
That's a good time.

2492
02:13:15,650 --> 02:13:20,420
If you can get, just Google it, you
can get tickets online and you can go,

2493
02:13:20,530 --> 02:13:22,790
this is a link on my
website and Joe rogan.net.

2494
02:13:23,290 --> 02:13:26,060
Click on the calendar and I and click
on the event. It'll take you to,

2495
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:29,090
I believe it's just Mandalay Bay
dot. Or don't go to stub. Okay.

2496
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:30,060
I'm telling you it out.

2497
02:13:30,060 --> 02:13:33,180
Stub hub buys a bunch of tickets
and there are scalping sore site.

2498
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:37,140
Really just Jack shut up on that shit.
It's like 160 towards your bucks.

2499
02:13:37,230 --> 02:13:40,560
There's still tickets available for
40 or 50 and these places are already

2500
02:13:40,561 --> 02:13:42,180
selling it for four or five times as much.

2501
02:13:42,270 --> 02:13:45,100
And you think that's the only place
as good as you can get them. Yeah.

2502
02:13:45,210 --> 02:13:50,040
Don't go to [inaudible]. They're
owned by Ticketmaster. Whoa.

2503
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:51,360
They're already evil empire.

2504
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:55,110
The only thing left is lab
stub until they sell to fucking

2505
02:13:57,460 --> 02:14:00,610
sell tickets. Use. He uses brown. No,

2506
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:02,320
but I think Ticketmaster has
got a piece of them tonight.

2507
02:14:02,670 --> 02:14:05,610
I think that what that is,
that's like the Ebay of ticket sales.

2508
02:14:05,611 --> 02:14:08,490
Like meaning dogs actually putting
it on Brown paper bags or something.

2509
02:14:10,670 --> 02:14:12,360
That's the way they do when
these companies get big enough,

2510
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:15,420
ticket master comes in and fucking
change them slightly. So there's Nope,

2511
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:17,790
we'll get it. No, I think the content
was still tickets left and right.

2512
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:20,050
You better stop talking shit
about the evil empire son.

2513
02:14:20,090 --> 02:14:21,810
They're going to fucking there.
Come down on you.

2514
02:14:21,811 --> 02:14:24,020
Just like they did on the left though.

2515
02:14:24,330 --> 02:14:28,710
It's a band that came down on Pearl
Jam came down on Pearl Jam. Right.

2516
02:14:28,740 --> 02:14:31,680
Until Jim refuse to go.
Unless you're charging 20% extra,

2517
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:33,720
we're not allowing you to take that off.
Our fans,

2518
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:36,750
they went to Congress and what happened?
How'd that work out?

2519
02:14:37,610 --> 02:14:41,970
Program kind of fell off the
map for a long time. Yeah.

2520
02:14:44,330 --> 02:14:47,130
Fucking albums. Songs to
shit. Half era, you know.

2521
02:14:47,131 --> 02:14:51,540
I mean after that there wasn't had at
their height they weren't 20 live because

2522
02:14:51,541 --> 02:14:53,790
they could only sell tickets
on Ticketmaster and it was low.

2523
02:14:53,830 --> 02:14:56,220
We don't want to gouge our fans.
I think green day,

2524
02:14:56,330 --> 02:14:58,230
I remember somebody ingredients.
I like how you said it best.

2525
02:14:58,231 --> 02:15:01,320
Why don't you just lower your charge list,
but no one should have to do that.

2526
02:15:01,321 --> 02:15:03,860
That should not be the reason
why Ticketmaster's. Okay. Yeah,

2527
02:15:04,120 --> 02:15:08,520
but master till he's asleep. They
shouldn't be selling tickets for free.

2528
02:15:08,521 --> 02:15:10,020
They shouldn't get 20%
though, right? Yeah.

2529
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:15,440
$2 $2 and $50 ticket
getting 20% service charge.

2530
02:15:15,510 --> 02:15:18,200
That's a computer.
There's no service. Yeah.

2531
02:15:18,201 --> 02:15:21,420
Well they have an infrastructure
to sell. Take a monopoly. Yeah.

2532
02:15:21,421 --> 02:15:24,210
It is kind of a monopoly because you
can't choose to do well now that you would

2533
02:15:24,211 --> 02:15:26,910
think with the Internet it would be pretty
easy to set up some sort of a virtual

2534
02:15:26,911 --> 02:15:29,370
shop and have everything the
tickets available online.

2535
02:15:29,430 --> 02:15:31,500
Like some places like the
Atlantic theater, it doesn't sell.

2536
02:15:31,501 --> 02:15:34,110
There's the Fandango and stuff. They
just sell the arclight side. Okay.

2537
02:15:34,111 --> 02:15:34,861
But let me ask you this.

2538
02:15:34,861 --> 02:15:38,430
Say if you wanted to rent out a place you
wanted to rent out the Orpheum theater

2539
02:15:38,431 --> 02:15:41,630
and he wanted to, uh, you
know, to, to put up with bull,

2540
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:44,300
you can rent out the Hollywood bowl
and you could sell your own tickets,

2541
02:15:44,301 --> 02:15:48,450
show your own tape. It's hard to
get where you want to do. It's like,

2542
02:15:48,451 --> 02:15:50,370
how would you get the letter
by the printed online,

2543
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:53,980
but they would have to go to the planes.
It works with airplanes. If you're,

2544
02:15:54,010 --> 02:15:55,680
I mean,
you can get a ticket printed online.

2545
02:15:55,681 --> 02:15:58,560
I would imagine you can get a ticket for
a comedy show printed online with some

2546
02:15:58,561 --> 02:16:01,790
sort of a barcode. But the, why
is everyone using Ticketmaster?

2547
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:03,180
What's the advantage to the venue?

2548
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:06,660
Because it's easy and you reach more
people though and you take credit cards.

2549
02:16:06,661 --> 02:16:09,960
Bam. There you go. Maybe
it's just the end, you know?
It's like it's happening now.

2550
02:16:09,961 --> 02:16:13,680
Like I see people a lot of times now
I'm at the airport when they don't even

2551
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:15,000
print their ticket up,

2552
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:18,120
they actually have it on their own
and then they scan their iPhone.

2553
02:16:18,150 --> 02:16:20,130
It was just pretty wild.
My friend at whoop,

2554
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:23,890
I just told me that there's this
application. Yeah, that, that, that,

2555
02:16:23,950 --> 02:16:27,330
that you know there's little things we
were talking about yesterday with that,

2556
02:16:27,331 --> 02:16:29,650
that you put her, any key chains
for like the grocery stores,

2557
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:31,960
grocery stores have all,

2558
02:16:32,090 --> 02:16:36,130
you just have all your information in
there and then they scan that dormitory

2559
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:38,680
keeps your phone up. Three of them,
they don't work. What do you mean?

2560
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:42,070
I've tried three of them and they don't
work from it. That keep your numbers.

2561
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:45,240
All you have to do is type in your number.
Like, oh, when you scan the barcode,

2562
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:48,220
you don't have to scan it in.
What it does is it saves all your numbers,

2563
02:16:48,221 --> 02:16:50,390
like a key chain.
So if that doesn't work with scanning and,

2564
02:16:50,391 --> 02:16:51,310
and he just sit there and go,
all right,

2565
02:16:51,311 --> 02:16:54,280
my number is one eight oh four seven two
five you can do that. But the scanning,

2566
02:16:54,290 --> 02:16:57,910
should we just write your number down
unlike your notebook and not have to

2567
02:16:57,911 --> 02:17:01,260
download some silly fucking
application notebook around here.

2568
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:03,290
All your notebook on your phone.
Yeah, you could do that too.

2569
02:17:03,300 --> 02:17:06,320
I know book on my phone has all
sorts of great notes, but I use,

2570
02:17:07,300 --> 02:17:09,910
this was supposed to be the barcode,
the UPC Barcode we're supposed to work.

2571
02:17:09,911 --> 02:17:12,580
Like if you get your Ralph's
Clower cvs card and whatever.

2572
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:14,290
So you just find that one
on the APP and just scan it.

2573
02:17:14,770 --> 02:17:19,030
It works rarely and not very really.
I used to Starbucks a application.

2574
02:17:19,031 --> 02:17:20,560
I wear it every single day.

2575
02:17:20,740 --> 02:17:23,640
But all you have to do is know your number
and then you can enter your numbers.

2576
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:25,360
But that's not the same as
being able to scan it. Right.

2577
02:17:25,410 --> 02:17:28,600
But why would I get an application when
you just fucking write down your number

2578
02:17:29,010 --> 02:17:33,220
means it's just one sec.
Cause it's easier because you just,

2579
02:17:33,221 --> 02:17:35,750
you just go to your car.
Right. But that's in there.

2580
02:17:35,890 --> 02:17:39,170
How many digits is your number?
I mean it's,

2581
02:17:39,560 --> 02:17:41,920
he's what he's saying is this application
you're supposed to be able to be like,

2582
02:17:41,950 --> 02:17:44,080
oh you got the great,
right. Yeah, but it depends.

2583
02:17:44,081 --> 02:17:46,690
If it's seven like a phone number,
you should be able to remember it easily.

2584
02:17:46,691 --> 02:17:51,150
Or if it's a hundred
cvs card at Barnes and nobles car.

2585
02:17:52,360 --> 02:17:55,360
True. But if you have a little
fucking notepad on your phone,

2586
02:17:55,390 --> 02:17:59,230
like that notepad feature on the iPhone
because on that do you write comedy on

2587
02:17:59,231 --> 02:18:03,280
that thing? I write on the other. Oh
yeah. Sears. That's a pretty big number.

2588
02:18:03,281 --> 02:18:03,790
That's like,

2589
02:18:03,790 --> 02:18:08,500
that's like a social security number or
number 10 numbers where the APP worked.

2590
02:18:08,501 --> 02:18:11,770
It'd be great just as a fully work,
a little thrifty bastard you,

2591
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:13,900
he had a bunch of little
key chains on that thing.

2592
02:18:13,980 --> 02:18:18,250
Do you collect your words for
Kush Mart and all that stuff?

2593
02:18:18,251 --> 02:18:21,760
You got money back? I took
already to my spot today. Zam Son.

2594
02:18:21,790 --> 02:18:23,850
I got some tanks shock. I tried to
text her for the first time though.

2595
02:18:23,890 --> 02:18:28,090
You were in the, uh, the card system,
man. They got rewards cards lately.

2596
02:18:29,390 --> 02:18:34,120
You should have come with us dean calmly.
You're right, you're right. I apologize.

2597
02:18:34,210 --> 02:18:35,930
I can't really just throw
this specific one. Sure.

2598
02:18:36,010 --> 02:18:38,350
For the folks who were eliciting and
going, what the fuck you're talking about?

2599
02:18:38,590 --> 02:18:40,970
It's like a liquid. You drop
it, a little liquid drop code,

2600
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:44,140
Glycerin Toe and it puts you on pollute.
Oh,

2601
02:18:44,940 --> 02:18:49,170
Eddie Bravo wrote a whole movie.
He,

2602
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:54,380
he drank a whole bottle of that stuff.
Did he really serene? Yes. No, no,

2603
02:18:54,381 --> 02:18:58,680
no, no wheat. The wheat oil or
whatever the fuck it is. It's merit.

2604
02:18:58,720 --> 02:19:00,460
It's marijuana and some
sort of a liquid form.

2605
02:19:01,030 --> 02:19:04,420
And he drank the whole bottle of it on
an airplane and he said he had the most

2606
02:19:04,421 --> 02:19:09,160
intense dream and he watched a movie play
out in the movie was called Shit Baby.

2607
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:09,761
And it was,

2608
02:19:09,761 --> 02:19:14,761
the movie was about a guy fucks this
girl in the ass and the shitty loads leak

2609
02:19:15,131 --> 02:19:18,550
out of her asshole and goes into
her vagina and she gets pregnant.

2610
02:19:19,210 --> 02:19:22,270
She smells like shit. It's a shitty
babies. You said you watched it play out.

2611
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:24,640
Was this in his head? He watched
it. He said he watched a whole,

2612
02:19:25,070 --> 02:19:27,980
the whole like shit baby going to

2613
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:29,870
school and everybody hates shift baby.

2614
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:33,050
He like watched this whole
movie play out in his mind.

2615
02:19:33,710 --> 02:19:34,910
He wrote it down when he got home,

2616
02:19:34,911 --> 02:19:38,630
but he said that it was like
the most intense like this,

2617
02:19:38,631 --> 02:19:41,960
this hallucination that he was under
because he was so high from this.

2618
02:19:41,961 --> 02:19:45,970
You can go for it man.
It's like Jesus, man.

2619
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:51,110
No fear. Just die. Well, he
didn't know what would happen.
He drank the whole thing.

2620
02:19:51,111 --> 02:19:54,050
It didn't know what, what happened. He
had it on him. He brought this little,

2621
02:19:54,051 --> 02:19:56,990
little tiny liquid. This is bad.
Just to keep this in context,

2622
02:19:57,020 --> 02:20:01,700
they told me one or two drops will
requeue drops. I've eye eyedropper.

2623
02:20:01,820 --> 02:20:05,240
Well they said one drop is about a
half a breath strip and half of breast

2624
02:20:05,241 --> 02:20:08,360
tripled. Fucking nothing.
Like half a cookie.

2625
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:11,660
Half a cookie will knock you on your
ass depending on the cookie, but yeah,

2626
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:14,630
you get the real shit.
They got the real shit at that place.

2627
02:20:14,631 --> 02:20:17,390
You got the kind of guy made us in
Chicago and then I place that I go to,

2628
02:20:17,391 --> 02:20:18,930
everyone's so nice,
you know,

2629
02:20:18,931 --> 02:20:20,810
and that's what I love going to
do when you go to the weed store,

2630
02:20:20,811 --> 02:20:24,690
everyone's so friendly. They are always so
friendly. Yeah. Hey, what's up? What's up?

2631
02:20:24,691 --> 02:20:26,420
You high five and what's going on?
What's up dude?

2632
02:20:27,020 --> 02:20:31,160
Dude's telling us about his employment
history and homes are tough and we're all,

2633
02:20:31,310 --> 02:20:33,440
we're all just sitting there
shooting the shit, watching a little,

2634
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:37,310
the news is on and people come in and
everyone's friendly placing orders.

2635
02:20:37,670 --> 02:20:41,630
This is how it's supposed to be. You can
ask the questions but like, you know,

2636
02:20:41,631 --> 02:20:43,940
I want something for munchies. What
do you got for that? Like I need,

2637
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,280
and they'll tell you, they'll help
you through it, help you through it.

2638
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:50,690
There's showman. You haven't you
poor bastards living in Nebraska.

2639
02:20:51,140 --> 02:20:54,110
Just get you get a masters.
You poor bastards.

2640
02:20:54,140 --> 02:20:57,170
They're just trying to get weed from
some Indian Dude who works at the casino.

2641
02:20:58,440 --> 02:21:01,220
Ruined my land. Okay. Can I just get
the way you did? Just give it to me bro.

2642
02:21:01,250 --> 02:21:03,920
Please. Can I get the weed? It's
great if you're a good customer,

2643
02:21:03,930 --> 02:21:06,240
have to weld like, oh, you gotta try this
new strain here for your APP. Just take,

2644
02:21:06,590 --> 02:21:09,180
they always given away free
shit, man. You are joint prayer.

2645
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:12,510
It's very rare that anybody
gives you free alcohol. You know,

2646
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:15,620
nobody gives you a free McDonald's
fries at Mcdonald's for two years.

2647
02:21:15,621 --> 02:21:19,340
I never get free ice cream because you
bought maybe do maybe just ice cream

2648
02:21:19,341 --> 02:21:21,590
rewards,
whatever bitches Friday night,

2649
02:21:21,591 --> 02:21:26,591
Mandalay bay 9:00 PM that people
know this shit is going down.

2650
02:21:26,870 --> 02:21:31,070
It's Joe Diaz. It's all Recia
fear. Doug Benson will stop in.

2651
02:21:31,220 --> 02:21:34,820
I will be there to let us know.
Uh,

2652
02:21:35,310 --> 02:21:38,620
UFC hunt for the edible on a
Oh, that's right. On Saturday.

2653
02:21:38,621 --> 02:21:42,140
The UFC Humphrey edible. So the way to
get a part of this is through Twitter.

2654
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:47,320
If you follow Ari shift fear at a r I s
h a f f I r follow Ari and Ari will be

2655
02:21:49,701 --> 02:21:54,080
hiding marijuana edibles,
allegedly, allegedly, allegedly.

2656
02:21:54,090 --> 02:21:58,010
This might be just a joke throughout
the casino. This may be just a joke.

2657
02:21:58,040 --> 02:22:00,950
If you're a police officer, I'm going
to tell you right now, this is a joke.

2658
02:22:01,460 --> 02:22:06,260
This is not real. So for you,
it's not real. For everybody
else, it might be real.

2659
02:22:06,380 --> 02:22:10,790
And so nothing to do with this
person.

2660
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:15,230
I barely know him. I know very little
about his past. I can't vouch for him.

2661
02:22:15,620 --> 02:22:18,230
I wouldn't be willing to sign for
him to get some sort of a passport.

2662
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:20,540
I've got to write a letter.
Joe India is really,

2663
02:22:20,650 --> 02:22:23,770
I'm gonna write a letter for Joey Diaz
to get a package out to where? Dog,

2664
02:22:23,780 --> 02:22:26,380
I want to go to England anywhere.
Talk those pitches off. Yeah, right.

2665
02:22:26,390 --> 02:22:28,950
A little bit about, I
don't know, criminal.

2666
02:22:29,150 --> 02:22:31,200
And a lot of people get to
look at him and go, Damn Dude,

2667
02:22:31,201 --> 02:22:34,590
what did you do when you're here for
what? That was months ago. Listen dog,

2668
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:38,100
I'm a new man. I'm a
new man. Friday night,

2669
02:22:38,101 --> 02:22:41,670
Joey Diaz will be with us pitches.
The shit is going to be epic.

2670
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:46,410
We're doing these shows now on a regular
basis in Vegas and they're fun as fuck.

2671
02:22:46,411 --> 02:22:50,490
I really, cause now we're getting
all the podcast fan. Yeah,

2672
02:22:50,730 --> 02:22:54,300

awesome. It gets up later. Yeah,

2673
02:22:54,360 --> 02:22:56,790

then get drunk. We'll get drunk with you.

2674
02:22:56,790 --> 02:22:58,080
How about that?
Beers while you're there,

2675
02:22:59,960 --> 02:23:02,970
we're going to be there and we'll
take pictures and answer uncomfortable

2676
02:23:02,971 --> 02:23:07,230
questions and you could put your sweaty
armpits over people's shoulders and take

2677
02:23:07,231 --> 02:23:11,560
photos. He, is this a loop or is this a
cell phone and it's just a ticket? Listen,

2678
02:23:11,620 --> 02:23:16,620
this fucking show is over tomorrow
depending on how sick my friend yon is who

2679
02:23:17,881 --> 02:23:19,980
wrote the crazy books about him.
Mushrooms.

2680
02:23:19,981 --> 02:23:22,440
We're going to have to call him
up and find out what's up. Yeah,

2681
02:23:22,441 --> 02:23:25,980
but he's a fascinating dude and he
wrote a lot of books about religion and

2682
02:23:25,981 --> 02:23:29,580
mushroom. Two books. Not a lot. It's not a
lot. It's a lot. If you don't write books,

2683
02:23:29,790 --> 02:23:31,920
what the fuck am I rambling for?

2684
02:23:32,090 --> 02:23:35,700

2688
02:23:46,110 --> 02:23:49,800
I wonder if NBC is going to have a
problem with my endorsement of this number

2689
02:23:49,801 --> 02:23:54,160
one sex toy. You are who you pretend you
are. I am who I am. I should make a chai.

2690
02:23:54,200 --> 02:23:58,650
I'm like, Popeye, bitch. I got mud. I
am. And that's all. But Hey, by the way,

2691
02:23:58,651 --> 02:24:02,910
let me just say this. Yuk Yuks in Toronto,
uh, July 20th through the 23rd Oh shit.

2692
02:24:02,940 --> 02:24:07,260

2693
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:09,840
He's been with me several
times up there in Canada.

2694
02:24:09,841 --> 02:24:14,550
Is the shit so fun in the zone and that's
it. It's fucking shows over. All right,

2695
02:24:14,551 --> 02:24:18,660

probably back tomorrow if John's not sick.

2696
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:23,830
But if he is sick and dice clay
apparently wants to do the podcast. Yes.

2697
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:28,800
Oh, big fat fucking ace. Oh.
