1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,540
Oh sweet. Jesus were added again. Yeah.
These headphones, they're a little tight.

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,170
Yeah. I need something a little more
relaxing. I need something fuzzy,

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,970
more Mexican, less Asian. Something
with like fuzzy, like a fuzzy ear.

4
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:19,140
Things like ear muffs.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,820
They'll do make that like some like
fuzzy comfort that I need to make one day

6
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:24,810
and like pillows that are like set carpet.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,530
They should make one out of like coyote
skin. Ooh, you don't like coyotes?

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,000
I don't like how you have these people.

9
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,920
Like why don't you like
Cody's man tell you why?

10
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:33,390
Cause they live in the
country and they eat cats.

11
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:36,240
He fuck silly pitches to people.

12
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:39,030
Like coyotes don't have to
deal with coyote stealing.

13
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:40,830
They're fucking animals from their,

14
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:43,980
from their leash and looking
at your kids like their dinner.

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,040
One of them attacked a fucking
little kid in big bear last year.

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,220
Five year old kid gets attacked in
front of his dad. Buy a fucking coyote.

17
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:53,910
Coyote can suck my Dick and if I
can make ear muffs out of those Fox,

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,450
I'll do it all day.
Make cat ears that are headphones.

19
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:02,160
They're really comfortable like soft
ones. Not like cat. I like cats. No,

20
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:06,240
I mean just make work. Coyote years. Yeah.
Coyote gets pretty much the same thing,

21
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:09,260
right? No. You want this side,
the pelt where you know the,

22
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:12,360
the thicker stuff on the side.
That's what you want on your ears.

23
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,200
That'd be pretty bad ass. Can
they do that? Yeah, absolutely.
Heated would be upset.

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,100
They'd be like, look at this fucked
up show. They have coyote ears on it.

25
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,080
This episode of the Joe Rogan's Franz
podcast is brought to you by audible.com

26
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,410
if you go to audible.com
forward slash Joe,

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,270
you can try audible free for 30 days

28
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:37,350
used audible. It is an excellent service
and I can recommend it very highly.

29
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:42,351
They have more than a hundred thousand
books and I have for years been a big fan

30
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,560
of books on tape,
way back to audio cassette books.

31
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:49,860
I used to listen to back when I was
a loser and I was living in revere

32
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:50,671
Massachusetts.

33
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:54,760
So I'd sit by the pool and I was trying
to jazz my future and I listen to

34
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:59,520
Anthony Robbins books on tape for
real. Seriously fuck yeah. Yeah.

35
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,620
I learned a lot of shit
that didn't apply any of it,

36
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,150
but I learned a lot of
shit from that dude.

37
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,830
I had to figure out my own sort
of path through this life. But um,

38
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,190
I became a big fan of audio books
then and back then they, you know,

39
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:14,070
used to have on cassette and uh,
get them,

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,150
but don't get Stephen King when he's
reading his own books. Just don't do it.

41
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,650
The motherfucker is so boring.
He drones on,

42
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,000
he's the one of my favorite
writers of all time,

43
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,050
but God damn does he suck when he's
reading his books. His books are awesome.

44
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:30,470
If they hire like a professional
actor really knows how to read it.

45
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,210
An audio book. But if you get
one that Stephen King writes,

46
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:36,240
what's the best reading you've heard of
someone else reading one of his books?

47
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,170
That's a good question.

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,140
I would have to go over them and
let Steve Martin and I immediately,

49
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:43,820
Steve Martin, uh, hit him reading
his comedy book was amazing. Uh,

50
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,490
born standing up or they have a lot
of history books like, uh, you know,

51
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,710
like this woman on audible.com,
uh,

52
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,370
listening to a history book about
World War II. Uh, I've never got,

53
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:57,510
I need to get into this because I'm an
auditory learner. You know, as they say,

54
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,680
it's like hard for me to listen
and people are like, who's that?

55
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,570
That's been Hoffman bitches respect.
Hey.

56
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,390
Then often you're in the
middle of an ad for audible,

57
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,690
but I want to get into books on tape.
Yeah.

58
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,290
Or now they call it books on whatever
self audio books and I w I, man,

59
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,810
you just sold, you just sold a
subscription. They're really, um,

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,480
it's great for traffic for,
you know,

61
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,420
if you're on an elliptical machine for
half an hour, what are you going to do?

62
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:23,500
Are you gonna Watch fucking Charlie's
angels on some repeat on that stupid four

63
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:27,850
inch screen in front of you and be bored
out of your head or listen to a book on

64
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:31,930
tape and get sort of an
educational experience that
are fun experience, you know,

65
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,410
if it's fiction, you know,
enjoy yourself and uh, you know,

66
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:38,770
reading does something
weird man. Um, you know,

67
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:42,970
like there's some enriching creative
aspect to reading that doesn't get

68
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:46,390
duplicated when you're just watching
things. I don't know what it is,

69
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,300
I don't understand it.
But reading like when you really,

70
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:50,560
like you read a great book,

71
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,570
like if you read Lord of the
rings or something like that,

72
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:56,320
the descriptive nature of the pros
just does something to you, man.

73
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,640
I don't know if it's the same listening
to it as it is actually reading it and

74
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,400
like sort of making the
inflections in your own head,

75
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,460
but I think it's way better than
just being stuck in traffic.

76
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,470
You're still getting that
knowledge into your brain,

77
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,900
getting that knowledge and your Dome Sun.

78
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,260
And if you go to audible.com
forward slash Joe,

79
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,440
you can get a free audio book and you
can also get 30 free days of audible

80
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:22,480
service. Again, it was more than a
hundred thousand titles on there.

81
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,660
So what was the book about?
World War II that you were checking out?

82
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,080
It's called Pearl Harbor.
Pearl Harbor. Yeah. Um,

83
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:32,390
another one I can recommend that I've
been recommended to people that have them

84
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:35,740
been, uh, coming back to me,
telling me that it's really,

85
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:39,490
really helped them is the war
of art by Steven Pressfield.

86
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,030
Steven Pressfield, uh, I've
recommended this before,

87
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:45,430
but I can't recommend it or not.
If you're a creative person,

88
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:48,340
it's one of the most amazing
and inspirational books ever.

89
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,690
But in Steven Pressfield was a guy who
was kind of a loser by the time he was 40,

90
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,930
and then he really got it all
together and he's gotten two bucks.

91
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:59,980
One of them was called the war of art and
the other one's called going pro and a

92
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,230
man, I love this book so much. I,

93
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,530
I used to buy like 10 and 12 at a time
from Amazon and I would just stack them

94
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,460
up in my house and kill people.
Yeah.

95
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,620
Ryan Kelly have it and
she's still at dirty bitch.

96
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:14,620
She ain't got no respect for you.

97
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:18,220
So you're going to go over and take her
and then Cox lab or just to let it just

98
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:22,090
to regain your territory tonight.
Yeah. You got to mark your, uh,

99
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,200
the Front Door to pee on her front
door. I took pitch, no done that.

100
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,950
You see that thing there that says
whisper sync for voice in that Ad.

101
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:34,060
And that's an amazing app
that they have for um, it's a,

102
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:38,060
an Amazon app that works with audible.com.
It's,

103
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,080
it's fucking incredible. Um, the,
the whisper sync for audible.com, uh,

104
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,400
not an Amazon zone. It's
a android rather. And um,

105
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,200
it also works on the
Amazon kindle fire HD,

106
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:54,850
which was their beautiful high
end HD tablet. Works on there. Um,

107
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,760
but it works on Amazon phones to our
Google phones right there. And what it is,

108
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:02,930
is as you're reading it, whisper sync.
You read the book and say you shut the,

109
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:04,570
shut it off at night.
Um,

110
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,540
when you go back in the
morning and get in your car,

111
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,860
it's sinked up to where you left
it on, on your, your reader.

112
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,580
So
what'd you get that far?

113
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,310
Because you're listening to your
whisper sank. Then your car. Oh,

114
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,390
well you're okay listening. You're
not okay dialing phones. I'm like,

115
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,500
why are you promoting crashes when people
as if a good book is going to make you

116
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,350
drive into a fucking corner point of
audio book? So you don't do that. Yeah,

117
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:34,130
you dumb ass. That's not
something a kid about your fucks.

118
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,980
There's times to use the crash. That's
not one of them. Um, anyway, uh,

119
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:45,010
whisper sync starts the audio companion
book to whatever book you're reading.

120
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:48,830
It starts it exactly where you
left off. It's a really cool, uh,

121
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,570
application and that's available.

122
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,140
So go audible.com page and open Anthony's.

123
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,880
Every single one of their
shows is on there. So if you,

124
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,940
if you will hear something cool about,
you should get into opening the Anthony.

125
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,330
I'll be in Anthony's the greatest show
on radio. They want it tomorrow morning.

126
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,150
Really? Yeah. Good. First Time. Are
you flying the red eye tonight? No,

127
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,921
I'm just going to call it.
Oh,

128
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:09,560
you're calling it for a baby bird
when you were there. They're great.

129
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,880
They're great.
They're the,

130
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,790
they're the easiest guys to
hang out with on radio ever.

131
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,970
You'd go in there and it's just like a
bunch of dudes sitting around talking and

132
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:20,030
everybody's just having fun and
everybody's, it's great. Like,

133
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,190
I didn't want it for myself, a plug about
myself into the intros here, but, well,

134
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,910

This is the first of many of our,
uh,

142
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,480
crazy sculpted artistically
rendered kettle bells.

143
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:02,280
I want to collect these and I don't
even know if I'll use it, but I want it.

144
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,900
I want to collect. These are,
these are, they are so bad ass.

145
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:10,520
The first one is almost sold out
already. It's um, it's a chimpanzee.

146
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,360
It's just a binary lick and
chimpanzee. Um, but we, uh,

147
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:17,090
we have other ones on the
way as well. We have, um,

148
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,600
I can't even tell you what they are.
I think we have to keep it a secret,

149
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,620
but they're all equally bad
ass. Um, various things,

150
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,200
not just chimps but various fucked up
cool things that are also kettle bells.

151
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,460
They're also balanced.

152
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,490
One of the things that
was really important about
making these is we monitor,

153
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:39,491
make sure that if we produced an artistic
kettle bell that it was also exactly

154
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:43,310
functional because there's some
kettle bells that look cool,

155
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,250
but like people have done designs
on them before, but they're,

156
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,190
they're not balanced correctly.
So when you use them,

157
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:52,400
they're not like universally
or uniformly balanced.

158
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,160
And we had to a specially
designed this to make sure

159
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,150
that it works really
well as the kettlebells.

160
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,120
And one of the things that works really
well is it has a nice wide base and it's

161
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:07,950
flat. So it's great for doing like
renegade rows and pushups. And um,

162
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,810
this is, um, only this is the first one
and it's only a 35 pound kettle bell,

163
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,370
which a lot of people like, Yo, bro,
you don't know how much I lift. Okay,

164
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,200
I totally understand if that's your thing.

165
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:23,030
But you can get a ferocious workout
from a 35 pound kettle bells,

166
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:26,040
especially if you use that
Kettlebell DVD that we sell,

167
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,160
which is the extreme kettlebell
cardio workout by Keith Weber.

168
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:33,360
Fucking tremendous Kettlebell DVD.
And that one is,

169
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,630
I use it a 35 pounder and
he kicks my ass every time.

170
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,070
But we've got some big ones coming up,

171
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:42,720
including a gorilla wait to you see
the gorilla. So the people that,

172
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,210
oh shit, they're fucking
fans like gorillas. Awesome.

173
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,920
You need to make a tick to a giant tit.
That wouldn't motivate you though.

174
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,750
I'd work out.
He just starts sucking on it.

175
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,270
It's just jacking off and
sucking on a metal tit.

176
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,260
We'll make it a blackboard and you won't,
what the fuck are you saying?

177
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,550
If it's too black doesn't look realistic.
It looks like a gorilla tit, you know.

178
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,710
That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Okay. I
got you. Nice recovery sort of anyway,

179
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:10,620
if you've made it flashcard. Yeah. You
don't want to make it sexy so you're like,

180
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:14,610
oh I want it. Yeah. Okay.
Anyway, primal bells,

181
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,790
they start today.
We,

182
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,800
I believe we were almost sold out
as of like an hour ago. So if uh,

183
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,880
if you want to buy one right?

184
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,780
They buy one right now because I
think that's pregnant dude. Alright.

185
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,030
You won cause that really
do want to collect these.
Yeah, they're pretty bad ass.

186
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,180
Look, if these things can actually
force Brian into working out,

187
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,400
it would be the most amazing
creation we've ever come up.

188
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,710
I'm just thinking at
home alone type thing.

189
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:39,110
Like somebody breaks in my house and I
have these like hang in and then knocking

190
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:43,340
them on the head type thing. Yeah. That's
a good, that's a good weapon. Yeah.

191
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:45,470
If you could fuck somebody up,
if you've got good technique,

192
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,750
if you know how to deliver a kettle bell,
yeah,

193
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,480
but if you don't know how to sling it
right, he might just take it from you,

194
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,670
stuff it up your ass. You got to think
about that too. Fair. These can't imagine

195
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,620
another web.
If anyone makes a cartoon about your job,

196
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,000
they have to use all your on
it. Uh, weapons. Like that's,

197
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,840
it has to have kettlebells,
battle ropes, suicide.

198
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,990
These are now ladies and gentlemen,
these are not welcome weapons.

199
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,400
All of these things that we sell are just
pieces of fitness equipment that could

200
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:15,480
double as weapons.

201
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,740
But the most important aspect of it
is the fitness aspect of you. Uh,

202
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,010
go to the website. You'll
see the different things.
We have like a battle ropes,

203
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:23,611
which are,

204
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:27,300
if you've never seen like videos of MMA
fighters doing strength and conditioning

205
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:31,080
training, they use these gigantic heavy
ropes and you whip them up and down.

206
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:34,890
And I've been using them a lot lately.
My new trainer, Justin, Milo, Suze.

207
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:39,120
I'm also a fellow student at 10th Planet
Jiu Jitsu has been training me and one

208
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:40,950
of the things we've been doing is a,
uh,

209
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,130
a lot of kettle bell battle ropes,

210
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,450
a lot of like box jumps and shit like
that, all stuff for functional fitness.

211
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,250
That's what I'm really into.
And uh,

212
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,640
that's the kind of things
that we concentrate on a at,

213
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:55,990
on it along with the best
supplements we can possibly buy,

214
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,870
whether it's food like
the, uh, the Tonka bars,

215
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:02,980
which are these delicious buffalo bars
with cranberry animal or hemp force

216
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:07,840
protein, the most, the most expensive
protein powder that we can buy,

217
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:12,580
the highest in protein content, the
most easily digestible, the smoothest.

218
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,900
It's, it's delicious. It's
got rom raw cocoa in it.

219
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,630
It's also gotten Maca and
it's sweetened with Stevia.

220
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,470
It's the best tasting protein
powder you'll ever try.

221
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:27,540
And it has like one gram of sugar and
it's super healthy. I started off, um,

222
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,970
a or a rather end off every
workout with a glass of that stuff.

223
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,070
It's fantastic pitches.
Check it out,

224
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,090
use a codename Rogan and you will save
10% off any supplements. All right.

225
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:40,660
You have fucks. Ben Hoffman is here.

230
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,420
Indiana so that it is an Indiana. Yeah,
but that's pretty unspecific. Kevin,

231
00:12:57,421 --> 00:13:00,730
somewhere in the state. Kevin Christie
is going to be joining us. Awesome.

232
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,080
Kevin Christie and Alison Shula. It's
going to be back. I don't know. She's,

233
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,850
she was on this episode one side.

234
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,460
She almost died and so we're going to
talk to her about that and she had like a

235
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:10,350
crazy staph infection. Yes. You got crazy.

236
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,750
They didn't even know what was wrong
with her. It's crazy. Staph infection.

237
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,130
It wasn't she in the hospital about a
month and so it's now just getting back to

238
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,830
doing comedy. She, she also was in a,

239
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,950
she is a musician now has I have a CD
out and a book that was in the top 10 of

240
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:26,460
iTunes. So she's like no fucking kicking
ass. And they have books on iTunes.

241
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,930
Ebooks. Oh, audio books. Audio books.
I'm sorry. Oh No, no, no, no, no.

242
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,330
She had a book. Itunes. Yeah. Uh, I
mean the still owe the iTunes store. Oh,

243
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,700
I see. Okay. The APP stores what
it is, write that book thing.

244
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,240
So she considered iTunes. What is
that considered? Yeah, movies, books.

245
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,640
Very cool person and a, anybody else? Uh,

246
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,670
there's some other people that I'm just
waiting on. Yeah, there's a lot of 'em,

247
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,490
a big name guys that already
in La this weekend was.

248
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:55,220
So most likely we'll have some tests.
They'll have some guests.

249
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,960
I will not be there. I'll be in Nashville
with a great Tamisa girl. Mommy. Yeah,

250
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,740
my pal and a hilarious comic.
You never seen Thompson Aurora.

251
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:05,180
This is really two headliners.

252
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,510
Tom is not by any stretch of the
imagination and opening acts.

253
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:12,590
He's opening for me just because we're
buddies and he had the weekend off and I

254
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:16,250
tried to take the best guys I can
with me. Like if I, if I can get Joey,

255
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:20,030
I get Joey. But Joey is almost always
busy now because he's too fucking popular.

256
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:20,864
Yeah.

257
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,833
Yeah.

258
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,000
You know Ari's so popular now too.
He's doing really well. But um,

259
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,110
but Thompson girls, it's always a treat
to work with them cause he's really like,

260
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,430
he's a super top level stand up. He's
a, and he's a super good guy too.

261
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:37,400
Just a sweetheart.
And he has his own podcast with his wife,

262
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:40,390
Christina P who's also funny as shit.
Yeah.

263
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,860
And it's called your mom's house and
you can end up, she's awesome. Yeah,

264
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:46,400
she's awesome. Very funny. Um,
and for a chick that shit's rare.

265
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:48,040
Yo Harlow,

266
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,010
did he just say, Oh yes
I did. It just means that

267
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,460
the ones who do it, it was there.
They're even better. Um, all right,

268
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,430

Cue The music.

270
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,253
Okay.

Powerful Ben Hoffman.
What? Joining us buddy.

274
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,350
What's up guys?
How about that fucking David Lee Roth.

275
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,540
Did you like that? Dude?
Here's what I loved about that.
I'm not saying this to me.

276
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:30,380
I didn't want to start with the ass
kissing, but I'll do it anyway. David,

277
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:33,650
isn't he the kind of the king of the,
just like the interviews were just like,

278
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,330
again,
nothing against him,

279
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:39,530
but like he is his normal interviews or
just like kind of one liners and like,

280
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,830
yeah, he's, he's covering up
for something. He doesn't know.

281
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,280
You prepare in this kind of scenario.
He can't, yeah. For two hours.

282
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:50,000
You can't just sit here and do like
Stephanie Bop and stick stick is the word

283
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:51,170
I'm looking for.
He just does.

284
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,950
I've seen a million David
Lee Roth interviews and he
just does his fucking stick.

285
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,730
I'm like, who is this man? You
don't know anything. Right, right.

286
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,050
But he came in and you're stuck
here for two hours, you know,

287
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,780
like in a good way or bad way.
But God,

288
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,760
that was a great fucking
David Lee Roth interview.

289
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,710
Yeah. We found that the,
yeah, it was, first of all,
it was surreal as fuck. Yeah.

290
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,960
Just sitting there and
talking to David Lee Roth it,

291
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,530
that's really David Lee Roth
shows up by himself. Okay.

292
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:16,810
Zero entourage kind of Ben Hoffman style.

293
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,150
Are those things called the
suspenders? Oh No. Um, overall.

294
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,530
Overall I used to wear that
shit and no underwear. Dude,

295
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:27,430
he's cool as fuck.

296
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,880
He's just a regular guy that happens to
be one of the greatest rock stars the

297
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:32,570
world has ever known. I mean, he, the,

298
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:36,550
the things he's seen men and when you say
it to him, you know, like, well, you know,

299
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,241
listen man,

300
00:16:37,241 --> 00:16:40,630
you're one of the greatest rock stars
the world's ever known was like, yeah,

301
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,760
I guess, you know, he's like,
I mean, he's not a fool.

302
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,050
He's well aware of who he is, but he
doesn't let it get in the way of anything.

303
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,310
But it is what in Japan.

304
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,330
Yeah, that's what he was saying on
thing, but it was just weird to see him.

305
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,790
It was almost like out of character. It
was like seeing him as a human, which I,

306
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,050
you don't think of him as, he's like, he's
like a superhero. Right? I know. Yeah.

307
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,400
This is

308
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,051
co well,

309
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:04,860
I was really fortunate that I hung out
with him one night at the comedy store,

310
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,680
so I got to see the Real David Lee Roth.
He came,

311
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,620
it was one of the weirdest things ever.
Like you don't even know who's in,

312
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,600
who's in the crowd when you're on stage
because the lights are bright and he'd

313
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:17,910
get off stage and all of sudden
you see someone and you go, Oh wow,

314
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:21,810
you just watched that, you know, and David
Lee Roth comes up and he goes, hey man,

315
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:24,240
I just want to tell you I didn't
think you were going to be funny.

316
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:27,720
Like what the fuck man? He blew my mind.
He was like, it was so nice. He goes,

317
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:30,990
I just assume like that's not a fear
factor guy. Seems like a nice fellow.

318
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,120
How funny can you be?
Holy Shit.

319
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:36,600
And he was like just super
like charismatic and hilarious.

320
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,960
We hung out with them for fucking
hours, right? Yeah. Like two hours.

321
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:42,930
Just chip away at the store a
few years back and we have it.

322
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,180
Actually I have it all on video.
The conversation,

323
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:48,560
the whole entire thing is on video
somewhere in this humongous pile.

324
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,080
The are on a lunch.

325
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,190
Yeah, we should get that. So I went
back. I don't think we, he wanted that.

326
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:57,440
I don't know. His manager contacted
like that shit on fire actually. Yeah.

327
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,550
Oh yeah.
It was already just I take it back,

328
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,370
do a little compensation.
Margaret talked about Paul, her

329
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,410
Joe your shirt.

330
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:08,970
It's so bad and you can show your
boss real quick if I can see the shirt

331
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,350
house Rogan. I got this from game of
Thrones today. They sent me this box.

332
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,270
It says a house Rogan on it and uh,

333
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,660
I guess they're sending these to all
the supporters of the game of Thrones

334
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:25,800
people who are like super fans and I
couldn't stop talking about the show ever

335
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:26,760
since I started watching it.

336
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:29,670
I had been tweeting it like crazy
and apparently it got back to them.

337
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:34,410
So they sent me this fucking amazing
box that says house Rogan on it.

338
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:35,700
And when you open it up,

339
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,700
it plays the theme song

340
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,320
and it has two DVDs in there too,
right

341
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,400
to the first season in the second season,

342
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:50,240
which I already showed the Scooby Doo
Doo Scooby Doo. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

343
00:18:50,241 --> 00:18:51,050
There's a secret.
Yeah.

344
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,270
Button.
When you press a button,

345
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,530
this thing pops out in a
scroll kind of HBO boner.

346
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,540
I guess you would,

347
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,160
you would hide your drugs there after
he got rid of the DVDs if you want.

348
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,870
By the way,
just to clarify,

349
00:19:05,871 --> 00:19:08,270
I'm guessing they're not
sending it to all super fans.

350
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,780
Just the top tier of superfans
probably get the giant. Right.

351
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,980
I know patent got one.
Patton Oswald.

352
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,810
That's how I knew what it was before I
opened the box because I looked like a

353
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:24,680
cigar humidor. And then I remember
seeing patents photo and I was, I was,

354
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,130
I said to my wife, I'm like, I told
her what it was before I open it,

355
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:32,630
but I was like, God, if I'm wrong, I'll be
so sad. Right. So, uh, this is the scroll.

356
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,480
They, they, they, they put a
scroll in a secret compartment.

357
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:39,750
They have to press a button.
It says loyalist of House Rogan.

358
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,180

362
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:58,680
March 31st cannot come soon enough.
Wow. Yeah, pretty bad. Awesome.

363
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,220
Coolest Symia girls use
panties or something and
that show girls big fans that

364
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,270
show girls. It's like sex in
the city for us. Younger Age,

365
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:13,140
sex and the city for girls.
Yeah. Is it good for younger,

366
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,180
younger crowds?
Entourage for girls on sex in it though?

367
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,140
Entourage with sex in the city. The
guys. Oh right. And this is this.

368
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:23,010
His entourage for girls

369
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,290
entourage never did a goddamn thing
for me. I don't know what it was.

370
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,640
I tried to give it a shot, but I
would watch entourage Hong Ago. Okay.

371
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,650
I like the scenery.
May everybody looked pretty.

372
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,970
Girls had straight up porn in it though.
Like it's pretty much watching a porn.

373
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,850
Yeah, they got, they wouldn't, they
would show shooting on the, on the chest,

374
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:44,120
like loads on the chest and everything.
You know what? I'm going to go buy that.

375
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,810
They show loads on the chest. What?
Wait a minute. How did they do that?

376
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,280
I don't know.
Cause it's a,

377
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,670
so like the girls coming her
tits and you see like Jesse,

378
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:58,420
the afterwards of aftermath
of him shooting on her chest.

379
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,960
You actually see it hit a,
I can't remember. I think
it was just on the chest.

380
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,740
So you just see it. You see her tits,
raw tits. I can't, I can't remember.

381
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:09,350
I'll find your acting like he didn't
rewind. It ain't your fucking dredging.

382
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,540
Good bets here. What happened?
What really happened?

383
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:17,650
Did you see loads on Ted's saw?
Look, you see loads on tits.

384
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,760
I don't remember if he was showing it
shot on the her tits or if it was just

385
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:22,360
after.

386
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,330
And so this is just about
a bunch of freaks lived
together and fuck the shit out

387
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:29,590
of everybody and pretty much is
it good? Yeah, just got into it.

388
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,780
So it's just,
uh,

389
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,620
you heard the part about loads on
chest all over the Internet, man,

390
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:36,760
that's 90% of the Internet.

391
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,670
It's funny how little that's
represented in the real world.

392
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,560
It's like finally loads are starting
to represent and then modern media,

393
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,780
it's a big part of people's life.

394
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:51,490
Online loads are a huge part of
people's life online. But, and you know,

395
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:53,620
on comedy central you rarely,
rarely see loads.

396
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,100
Do you think it would screw you up if
you were a kid not watching all this

397
00:21:57,101 --> 00:22:00,760
internet porn and you would think that's
how every, how sex is supposed to end?

398
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,850
Well they say that a lot of girls are
having anal sex now because of that.

399
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,470
That it wasn't really nearly as common
in the eighties, nineties. What have you.

400
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,221
It's crazy.

401
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:12,580
It's just crazy to me to think like it
doesn't every porn you watch basically

402
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,570
and like in the face, most of them
do. Yeah. Like if you're a kid,

403
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:19,970
if I was watching it, I'm like, that's how
babies are made, I guess. You know? Well,

404
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,020
I don't think they're
thinking about making babies.

405
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:24,340
I think that thinking about fucking,

406
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,660
and the problem with that is you're
watching people don't fuck like people

407
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:29,720
really fuck,
you know,

408
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:33,160
like it's not normal for a girl to spit
on your Dick and then you just shove it

409
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:37,030
in her ass. Right. That is pretty real.
Sam. Sandy, weird to be a kid nowadays.

410
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:40,240
I wonder how that would feel it pin it
fucks with your hardcore, well look,

411
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:44,470
porn has made one dominant victory in
our culture and that's in the world of

412
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:48,280
pubic hair poring through
dominated crabs is going away.

413
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,110
Did you hear about that really?
Because of that?

414
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:54,580
Because everyone's shaving
no more crabs that STDs.

415
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:59,530
You're more likely to catch STDs when
uh, when everyone's shaved. Really?

416
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,820
Yeah. So crabs over STDs. I think
it'll take crabs. I guess you're right.

417
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:06,640
Why is that? Because you're closer
and more contact and stuff. Yes,

418
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:11,670
I gas then maybe the natural flora and
your pubic hair access some sort of a

419
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,530
preventative barrier. Like while
you're supposed to have eyebrows,

420
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:17,830
it keeps the sweat out of your eyes. Yeah.
That's what it's there for. Right? Yeah.

421
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,030
So yeah. And I don't know if that metaphor
works, but that's what it's for, right?

422
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,880
I mean, that's exactly why
it's above your fucking four.

423
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,630
I'm not sure if that's the pubic hair
metaphor works and people that are in from

424
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:31,210
really funky climates.
That's why they have that unit brow.

425
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,880
It's for the whole face.
They don't want it on the nose.

426
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,470
You don't want it rolling
down into your eyes.

427
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,440
You don't get the unit brow and the blonde
communities because they're freezing

428
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:42,730
their dicks off up in Iceland. Okay.
Right, but you want to go to Persia.

429
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,010
Those motherfuckers are
hot. It's hot there. I never

430
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,750
thought about it like that.
That makes perfect sense. Yeah.

431
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,580
I'm dropping science on you,
Ben Hoffman.

432
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:53,240
I had no idea pubic hair was
supposed to attract birds. Actually,

433
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:55,970
I was saying before, I need to learn
more about eyebrows and pubic hair.

434
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,180
Pubic hair was supposed to attract birds
and they were supposed to make me an s

435
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:00,014
on your crotch.

436
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,070
You need to think about some of the shit
before you sat and wonder if it's worth

437
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:08,750
doing because that one wasn't. I say
no, don't you want to ever meet? Fuck,

438
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,980
save that shit from muffs set. Okay.
And this podcast and once your a game,

439
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,470
I'm so game of Thrones,
they also send you a, hey,

440
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,430
I'm a flash drive with a bunch
of images and social media.

441
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,170
They give you like a banner that you
could put on your Twitter page that says

442
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:32,020
house Rogan. That's pretty bad ass.
Oh, it's got your name on it. Yeah.

443
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,650
Crazy. Yeah. I'll throw that
shit up before the premiere
should have the premiere.

444
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:40,190
It's doing its job too. Yeah,
they're fucking bad ass man.

445
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:44,540
That is a really clever use of marketing.
Hbo Knocking it out of the park.

446
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,850
Yeah,
HBO is on top of Shit.

447
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,390
They have so many fucking good shows
and they show loads on the chest to

448
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,550
apparently allegedly I'm not buying it.
I got it. I would have heard about that.

449
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,350
This motherfucker Suntan Lotion.
He thinks it's loads,

450
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,880
loads of sex and hits his head right
straight over here and gets on the Mike.

451
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,920
Did you hear a little research?

452
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,480
Did you hear about that kid in
Ohio that weren't wearing the Ohio,

453
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,750
that killer shirt and
all that shit shut up.

454
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,750
He shot up and killed I think
three people in a, in a school.

455
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,830
And then he got a life and
he's getting life in prison.

456
00:25:19,831 --> 00:25:23,580
But what he did is he took off his shirt,
he had like outside collar shirt on.

457
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,360
And during the like hearing the last
hearing he took off his shirt and it said

458
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,600
killer. And then he like looked at the
victim's eyes, like his last words.

459
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:33,750
It's like, I want you to know like
this hand that shot your kids.

460
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,210
I used to masturbate every
night or something like that and

461
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,550
thinking about them,
you know. And they said,

462
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,680
well look at this fucked up kid man.
When was this? This was yesterday.

463
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,290
And uh, and yeah, it's this big thing
right now because now that, you know,

464
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,124
like they're getting,

465
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,930
oh the people are getting in trouble
cause how did he get that shirt past the

466
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:59,160
security guards and stuff like that.
And I guess, you know, just uh,

467
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,850
just cause you know, all the families
to burst out in tears and all this.

468
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:05,330
I mean this kid is a fucking
piece of shit and his sister,

469
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,390
are you talking about this?

470
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,510
Because we were talking about it like
how porn was affecting kids earlier and

471
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:12,720
I'm just talking about like how kids
have been like these crazy kids now.

472
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,270
Crazy. Yeah, man, I don't really don't
want to dwell on this guy though.

473
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,350
I don't like talking about this kind of
shit. I think the worst, not only that,

474
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:23,740
this whole serial killer thing,
it feeds off of you talking about it.

475
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,680
That's how these guys get
this idea in the first place.

476
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:30,100
It'd become special because they know
that if they do something really fucked up

477
00:26:30,101 --> 00:26:33,070
a bunch of people, we'll talk
about it. And that's an inevitable.

478
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:36,550
But there's a lot of things to concentrate
in this life if you want to start

479
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:39,610
concentrating every day and how many
fucked up people the wrong in the world.

480
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:40,660
You Become Nancy grace.

481
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,470
Yeah. I'm just saying this is what's
hitting the news. If you heard it yet.

482
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:44,090
That's fucking,

483
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,230
that's what I talking about porn though.
No,

484
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,630
I'm just saying how how
fucked up kids are nowadays.

485
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,790
Most kids are not with the school.

486
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:54,150
She was the greatest time to
live ever as far as violence.

487
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,580
There's some people that are fucked up,

488
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,510
but the amount of them in comparison
to the rest of the human population,

489
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,200
it's way less. There's, this is
the safest time to ever be alive.

490
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,770
It's 300 million fucking people in this
country and every now and then one of

491
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:12,000
them blows a fuse. I like your view
though, of not giving him the coverage.

492
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,560
That's an interesting way of doing it.

493
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:17,940
Don't give them the the fucking
a time of day. Well, you can,

494
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,770
you can concentrate on
that for every show,

495
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:25,800
every day if you want it to.
There's enough out there.

496
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,250
There's constantly fucked
up things out there,

497
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,130
but that kind of shit like someone trying
to fuck with the family after he kills

498
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:36,540
him. I don't want to talk about that
guy that that's not, I don't like that.

499
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,190
I don't like hearing about it.

500
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,750
It's the whole idea behind it that this
kid can get away with something like

501
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:47,010
that. If we, if we live in
a world that makes sense,

502
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,120
when someone does anything
remotely fucked up like that,

503
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,000
you beat them to death.
You don't,

504
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,800
you don't bother feeding them and
housing them and taking care of them.

505
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:03,600
You beat them to death. That's what you
do and you, you saved money doing it.

506
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:08,550
You do it with a fucking club and he
just smashes diseased brain and then you

507
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:09,384
move on.

508
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,830
But we live in this pussified world where
a cut like that can say that in front

509
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:18,180
of those people and not have the normal
re normal, healthy, relaxed reaction,

510
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:21,400
which is just killing him.
He's broken. That's a damage.

511
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,300
Human being that will never get
better and you have to kill them.

512
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,880
You don't house them,
you don't feed them.

513
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:30,030
You don't put him in a fucking special
room and they can't touch other people.

514
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,840
You kill him because there's no
reason for them to be around.

515
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,970
There's nothing you're
going to learn from them.

516
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,590
All you're going to do is find out what
made them fucked up and you're not going

517
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:43,080
to prevent that unless you got fucking
cameras and everyone's bedroom from the

518
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:46,680
time of kids born to the time they
finally escaped their current parents and

519
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:49,320
become a psychopath and go
roaming through the streets,

520
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:53,010
killing people to try to fill some hole
inside of them or whatever the fuck is

521
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:55,710
wrong with them,
but we don't do that and that.

522
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,110
That's what drives me the most
crazy about watching those things.

523
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:02,110
It's not just that people like that exist
is that people like that only exists

524
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:05,460
because we don't have community anymore.
Our system of government,

525
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:08,160
our system of laws,
when it set up to deal with bad people,

526
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,380
we for whatever fucking reason,

527
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,390
when someone's a horrible
piece of shit like that,

528
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,190
want to show that were humane
and show that we have, you know,

529
00:29:16,191 --> 00:29:21,191
we have a morals and we have laws and
we have a a certain way you shouldn't do

530
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:22,291
that.

531
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:25,860
You should beat that guy to death and
let everybody know that you can't do that

532
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:28,230
to people.
You can't torture and kill people.

533
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,070
You can't try to hurt the victim's family
by saying something fucked up because

534
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:34,560
you're a mass.
Just get that thing dead,

535
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,730
get that thing dead and off the planet
and let's say I'm with you on that one.

536
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,020
You got to do with all of them,
all pieces of shit. You gotta.

537
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,310
There's gotta be a real reason
to not be a piece of shit.

538
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:50,550
The problem is they're raised by horrible
people and then the other problem is

539
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,640
who's to say whether or
not a person's guilty.

540
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:57,100
Who's to say whether or not
a person really did do this.

541
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,370
When you have a case like that where not
only did you do you know the guy did it,

542
00:30:00,371 --> 00:30:02,590
he's joking around about it.
Just talking about it. Yeah,

543
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,530
that's a dead man and
if he's not a dead man,

544
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:08,950
we live in a pussified society that's
allowing people like that to exist.

545
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,750
They should never let
them get to that point.

546
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:13,150
Somebody probably knew he was
fucked up a long time ago.

547
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,480
They should have got together,
had a little conversation
and put his lights out.

548
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,450
You seem to staircase.

549
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,920
No one is that this documentary
about this guy who killed basically,

550
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:27,270
it's not definitive, but he basically
killed his wife. You got to see it.

551
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:31,160
It's the best fucking documentary. It's
like this what? Like think eight part.

552
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,260
No one here seen it. This eight part
documentary that was on Sundance,

553
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,810
he claimed his wife fell down the stairs.

554
00:30:36,811 --> 00:30:40,740
I don't want to give it away because you
have to watch it and it's like you find

555
00:30:40,741 --> 00:30:45,600
it all this crazy shit. But he
says his wife fell down the stairs.

556
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,360
It turns out, actually, I'm not going
to say the next part is the same.

557
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,650
It turns out he had it.

558
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:53,610
He had another woman he knew years before
who also fell accidentally fell down

559
00:30:53,611 --> 00:30:57,870
the stairs.
Mr. Well to do like a really wealthy man,

560
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,140
a novelist who like you
would never suspect,

561
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,060
but they had cameras
running the whole time.

562
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,230
It was foots fucking and they just aired
a special to hidden camera's running.

563
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:10,760
When they interviewed him, you mean? No
cameras running in his house. The whole,

564
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,380
so there's a whole trial.
They the first thing,

565
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,630
as soon as they found out about
it, they went to his house. Can we,

566
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,860
can we document the whole process?
Whoa. And they have the whole thing.

567
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,860
It's the staircase you can get
on Amazon. It's, it's awesome.

568
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,770
So do you think he's innocent at first
and then towards the end you start

569
00:31:25,771 --> 00:31:26,604
thinking that it's good.

570
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,980
It, it's enough. He throws you man. Cause
I have friends who've seen in store like,

571
00:31:31,981 --> 00:31:35,100
you know, I think he's innocent so it's,
there's enough up in the air that maybe,

572
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,510
but there's too much coincidence for me
personally. Two wives fall down a store.

573
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:42,960
The first one wasn't a why it was a
friend. It's one of his best friends.

574
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:47,340
It's the whole thing. I mean there's
just, it was a girl. Yes. Both girls. Yes.

575
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:50,890
And one was one he adopted.
Again, I'm giving away too much.

576
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,510
Probably kill someone pretty easy by
throwing them down a flight of stairs.

577
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,890
I bet most people would die.

578
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,030
But of course it looks like kicked him
down a flight of stairs but need guests.

579
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,950
Why do you want to know the ending?
Sure. He's off. Really. Yeah.

580
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:09,210
Whoa. They had just this, this
documentary aired like my five years ago.

581
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,080
So you believe he's guilty?
I do is my belief. But,

582
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:18,060
and he was in jail until like a year ago
and they aired the special addendum to

583
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,890
it. Then you go, wow.

584
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,050
Yeah. People get away with Shit, man.

585
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:25,410
There's some psychos out there and there's
also people that live with horrible

586
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:29,520
people and that you fucking just feed
off each other's hate and you get to the

587
00:32:29,521 --> 00:32:30,090
point where

588
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,640
it's, the thing that throws, throws you
about this documentary is his family.

589
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:36,150
Seems like all great people. It
throws you, especially the kids.

590
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,130
What was the white flight though, Wayne?
I never saw she, she was, she was dead.

591
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,450
Who knows?
Maybe the wife was a problem.

592
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,300
He had to kick her down a flight of
stairs. Yeah. I mean, yeah, maybe.

593
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,890
Maybe you had a good reason. I don't
have to smell good reason to do that.

594
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,740
They hire you. I'm Jake. I'm J K
and these are just jokes. Fine.

595
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,690
We're just trying to find a way to talk
about this. Um, yeah, there was a show.

596
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:59,540
Do you remember HP pose?
I'm Dr. Michael Baton.

597
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:02,960
The autopsy shows number does,
do you ever see those bright?

598
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,400
Yeah, it's disgusting. I mean, I didn't

599
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,300
watch full episodes, but I will
try to watch him. Well, he,

600
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,630
he busted a lot of murderers
because he would, uh, you know,

601
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,030
through friends and Kevin and
they'd find like one small thing.

602
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,710
Oh man,
it was seven years ago,

603
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,030
several years ago.
A lot of really creepy shit on it.

604
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,730
But one of them was this
guy's wives just kept dying.

605
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,300
He's fucking people,
man. It's like they got,

606
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,770
and my lucky day got away with it once
and he figured, well, fuck it man.

607
00:33:34,771 --> 00:33:38,010
I know how to do this and probably
wet your appetite, I'm sure.

608
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:42,030
And I bet they also feel like as
long as they don't go to jail for it,

609
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,840
no one's even going to look into it. Like,
oh look, they said it was an accident.

610
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,890
She died. Oops. And then also the next
one dies and it was, I don't know.

611
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,890
The other one was an accident.
Okay. I told you it was an accident.

612
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,000
There's one was an accident
too. Like, Ooh, that's when
people closing on your son.

613
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,550
But these kind of documentaries
too, when you see, cause you get,

614
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,120
you get thrown cause you
see the prosecution and the
defense and you hate them.

615
00:34:03,121 --> 00:34:06,000
Both. Both lawyers send, you're
like, who the fuck is right?

616
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:10,850
Because both of the lawyers are so fucking
annoying. It's like which side do I,

617
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,120
I hate them both kind of.

618
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,820
It's gotta be hard to be a person that
operates in the legal system and tries to

619
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:19,950
get bad people off.
That's your job.

620
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:25,260
And then you got to go out and face the
world knowing that like what if he got

621
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:28,680
that kid with the tee shirt? What if he
got that kid off to be that kids lawyer?

622
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,060
Right. That's what if somebody got that
kid off on a technicality. You know,

623
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:36,810
what if there was like some contamination
of evidence or what have you and that

624
00:34:36,811 --> 00:34:39,460
that fucking kid got free.
At what point do you like to say like,

625
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,313
I just can't do this.

626
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,520
I don't know if that kid had,
it was on prescription medicine,

627
00:34:42,521 --> 00:34:43,840
like all the other ones.
I want it.

628
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,010
And there's fucking girls supposedly that
are tweeting that they're in love with

629
00:34:48,011 --> 00:34:49,000
him cause he,
I think he's cute.

630
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:53,940
Oh that happens a lot, man. Yeah.
That guy, the um, Richard Ramirez,

631
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:58,080
he got married in jail or people
love fan. Yeah. He's the night stock.

632
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:02,670
He would stomp girls' heads in and crush
their skulls and he's got people that

633
00:35:02,671 --> 00:35:03,504
visited him in jail.

634
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,020
Mickey Mallory Knox.

635
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:10,310
Who is that you meant that the movie
natural born killers where they glorified

636
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,640
as superstars on this.

637
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,350
Well,

638
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,950
to a lot of people that live in a world
of shit and that that is a problem with

639
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:21,580
our society, that lack of community
that we talked about. That's,

640
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,500
that's a big problem.

641
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:25,600
And when people are allowed to
grow up living in a world of shit,

642
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:30,250
when there's not enough people to be
around, to be friends, to love, to,

643
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,480
you know,
to,

644
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,230
to support people when you're just on
your own living in a world of shit and

645
00:35:35,231 --> 00:35:38,190
abuse and he grew up to be a monster.
You know,

646
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,470
we are this disconnection that we have
with our neighbors and disconnection we

647
00:35:43,471 --> 00:35:46,230
have with our coworkers.
And you know, this,

648
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:51,260
this lack of like real deep being full
friendships that so many people out in

649
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,730
this life that's a,

650
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:57,510
that's one of the big holes that people
have over and over and over again.

651
00:35:57,511 --> 00:36:00,450
If you find like really angry people,
you find out that they're loners,

652
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,870
you find out that they're rejected.
They don't have loved ones,

653
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:07,050
they don't have good friends.
It's ran kind of a loner.

654
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:08,400
Now I'm getting worried about myself.

655
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,980
I'm glad I got you from the
moment I met some friends.

656
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,620
I'm not one of these crazy, you're not a
loner. You know what I'm talking about?

657
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,580
Like being alone with the people that
are just like keep themselves at work.

658
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:18,810
Don't have conversations.
We will.

659
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:21,060
That's the guy who's going to come in
with a gun and shoot everybody. Right?

660
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,760
There's something about humans where we
desperately require each other and we

661
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:32,100
have to be aware of that. It's, it's,
you can say, you know what, man, I don't,

662
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,190
I like to be alone. People Annoy
me. Know you'd like to be alone.

663
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,750
Sometimes we all like to be
alone. Sometimes you do not
want to be alone forever.

664
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:43,770
You don't. You'll be horrified. You'll
be terrified. You'll be miserable.

665
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,710
You can live where people
are around you all day,

666
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,260
every day for the rest of your life.
You can live fine.

667
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,810
Maybe it will be annoying sometimes,
you know?

668
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:55,080
Maybe you'll be looking for some peace
and quiet and you won't get it as much as

669
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:58,320
you need it, but you'll be
fine. If you live by yourself,

670
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:02,250
you'll go fucking crazy. You'll commit
suicide to jump off a cliff. You'll,

671
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,610
you'll become friends with the
volleyball. Yeah, like Tom Cruise,

672
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,690
Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise manager
of Tom Cruise was in that.

673
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,340
I feel a lot more screaming, I guess.
Say it again. It'd be 20% 20% more gay,

674
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,090
at least at volleyball would have been
popped a long time ago if I brought,

675
00:37:18,091 --> 00:37:22,870
would have lipstick on it and
holes in it. Not all your name. Oh,

676
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,390
why don't you put lipstick on your bubble?

677
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,260
What was teaching it? What did they
teach you over at comedy central Sun.

678
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,600
I don't know.
That takes me crazy

679
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:36,660
teaching and crazy shit. Um, so thank
you to HBO for this, this hookup.

680
00:37:36,661 --> 00:37:39,510
It's what the coolest thing I've ever
gotten ever. This game of Thrones thing,

681
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:42,070
and thank you for the tee shirt.
It's pretty bad ass. That's,

682
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,200
that's how I promote things.

683
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,430
The other way to promote things is
come on this podcast, Ben Hoffman.

684
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,910
Oh Shit. What is science? What an
intro. That's a segue side show.

685
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,540
Thursdays at 10 on comedy central.
We got nothing like this.

686
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,220
How many have you done so far?
The, the third aired last week.

687
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:03,360
So people are watching this live, right?
Some people are watching this live.

688
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,030
People are getting this.
If you're watching this live,

689
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:11,040
there's a special sneak peek tonight at
10 30 after workaholic, but on Itunes,

690
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:14,090
this is going to be nothing to you because
it's going to get it tomorrow morning

691
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,120
on it's on tomorrow.

692
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,490
It's on Thursdays at 10 for everyone else
and we got five more episodes left and

693
00:38:20,491 --> 00:38:23,400
I think they're funny, but actually
I've, I have mixed feelings.

694
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,730
I'm not a big Ben Hopp and fan,
but overall I think it's pretty good.

695
00:38:26,731 --> 00:38:30,880
How many of you aired so far? We've heard
three and there's five more and it's a,

696
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,540
um,
I'm trying to,

697
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:36,880
it's like a sketch comedy show mixed
in with like may on the street.

698
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,090
So you see me in my real life.
If like we were shooting right now,

699
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:40,990
I'd be shooting this.

700
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,080
There's a clip gangsta granny.
So you would come in and do it.

701
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,710
We'd be shooting this if this is yeah,
if I was shooting the show.

702
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,070
So it blurs the lines. This,
yeah, this is a fake audition.

703
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,760
So they can they watch this, right? Sure.
Tough talk. You're a gangster granny.

704
00:38:55,761 --> 00:38:59,060
You're pissed off and uh,
let's do it.

705
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,280
He's a real old ladies trying
to audition for a part.

706
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,290
Listen Up.

707
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:13,000
And they asked how goes because
the guy was coming for us.

708
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:18,220
They're going to cover this place
with their run up to the ground.

709
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,760
Well,
fucking big money business company.

710
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,220
Ah, sit here, you know,

711
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,500
shitty diapers.

712
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,740
Or we can exercise our second amendment
rights and get some mother fucking guns.

713
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,840
Wow.
That was really good

714
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:47,050
bro, bro, bro, bro, Bro. Respect
the elderly mother fucker.

715
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,200
Perfect.
Got to turn my hearing aid off.

716
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:54,180
Shit's about to get loud fuckers.

717
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,030
Time to move into a home.

718
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,300
That was great. Really Great. And the
last one is I came here to do two things,

719
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,800
handout hard candy and blow some mother
fucking dicks off and I'm all out of

720
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:18,634
hard candy.

721
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:23,030
I came here for two things
to suck some hard candy.

722
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,440
Perfect.
Okay.

723
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,060
Yes. So we put that out.
We put out this kit,

724
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,700
we put out this cast and call little
over la that we're looking for this new,

725
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,010
we're doing a new movie. We didn't
tell him it was comedy central show.

726
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:55,810
We said this new movie
called gangster granny,

727
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,920
but a tough talking grandma and we need
old ladies to come in and audition and

728
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,510
we gave him sides like,
you know,

729
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:03,550
I don't know if they're going to read
this and every fucking, you know,

730
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:07,480
people want to work. They all read this
fucking thing and then so we felt bad.

731
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:11,140
So then we shot a scene from the movie
when you got to realize that the grandmas

732
00:41:11,141 --> 00:41:14,770
have today, if you're dealing
with a 67 year old lady of today,

733
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,390
that lady was like rocking it in
the 70s you know what I'm saying?

734
00:41:19,391 --> 00:41:23,720
That not the grandmas of when we were
children who were like in the 50s there

735
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,910
was a seventies grantees, so they parted
their dicks off. Ready? They were like,

736
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:31,480
haven't they were all, they were having
a blast. That was the weird thing.

737
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,520
Every audition he said like that exposes

738
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,500
just how fucking easy acting really is.

739
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,840
Oh did we did,
we did,

740
00:41:37,841 --> 00:41:41,500
we did four different fake audition
things throughout the series and cause

741
00:41:41,501 --> 00:41:41,761
listen,

742
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:46,761
I've been a million of those auditions
and I as as bad as they were and as funny

743
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:48,850
as it was,
they were no better or worse to me.

744
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:54,070
Like they would have beaten me in any
role. I mean I just got lucky and got the,

745
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:58,280
a lot of people out there that auditioning
for parts that could do it easily.

746
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,090
That's why I love when someone like
Justin Timberlake becomes a big actor

747
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,280
because he's not an actor.
He's a fucking singer.

748
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,110
I love when like an athlete does,

749
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:09,740
it becomes a really good actor
because it shows you it is not hard.

750
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,990
It's one of the easiest things to do ever.

751
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,230
You're a member of the words and then
you pretend and it's not that hard to do

752
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:18,980
and some people do it better than famous
people and they easily could be famous.

753
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:19,501
Yeah.

754
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:21,990
That's why I wanted to put a lot of real
stuff in the show cause I'm just like,

755
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,090
aren't real people just as
funny as fucking most of my
actors. Yeah. There's all,

756
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,350
there's all a lot of funny
fucking people out there.

757
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,160
They just have never figured out how
to make a living off of it. Totally.

758
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,670
Growing up like didn't I always tell my
friends like were you the funniest kid

759
00:42:35,671 --> 00:42:39,480
growing up? No, exactly. Like I
was. I hung out a lot of funny kids,

760
00:42:39,481 --> 00:42:42,260
but all my friends were funny. I just,
for some reason decided to get into it.

761
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,300
I wasn't even close. Yeah. But there was
so many funny kids who were just like,

762
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,920
what they wanted to be a doctor or
work at a bank or, you know, whatever,

763
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,040
whatever it was.

764
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,550
The funniest person I ever met in my
life was a private investigator. Really?

765
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,820
Yeah. This is still as, his name's Dave
Dolan. Dynamite. Dick was Dave Dolan.

766
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,570
I worked for him when he lost his Dick.
He used to call himself

767
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:03,680
crazy dynamite ticklish.
Dave Dolan, who's, oh,

768
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,680
he's crazy and sober too, by the way. When
I met him, he had just lost his license,

769
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,870
uh,
from drinking and driving crashes,

770
00:43:09,871 --> 00:43:14,010
car a tunnel and try to run on and flip
from the cops. Holy Fuck. It's crazy.

771
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,570
And he was a private investigator,

772
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:18,660
so he needed someone to drive him
around because he lost his license.

773
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,960
There's this, is that not
a Sitcom right there? Yeah.

774
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,010
Fire investigator who can't drive and,
yeah.

775
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,310
Well, I, uh, I responded
to the job, you know,

776
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:30,120
it was like some newspaper or something
like that, and I called him up,

777
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:34,740
asked him what it was all about, what the
hell we're supposed to be doing. And, uh,

778
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,920
I started working for him,
so I worked for him for whatever it was,

779
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,700
90 days or something like that until
his license was, uh, brought back.

780
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:43,010
Might've been six months.
Uh,

781
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,140
but then he got his license
back and didn't need me anymore.

782
00:43:46,141 --> 00:43:48,630
And that was by then I was
sort of starting to get gigs.

783
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,550
He started it.
But you still hang out with him?

784
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,200
Yeah, yeah. I'm still friends with
them. I, I go back and, you know,

785
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,820
talk to him whenever I'm in Boston,
the kind of tickets to the UFC.

786
00:43:56,821 --> 00:44:00,660
He's a great guy. He's an awesome
dude, but he's fucking hilarious.

787
00:44:00,661 --> 00:44:01,920
He was always hilarious.

788
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,650
We would go on these things and
most of what the insurance, um,

789
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,170
or most of what the private investigation
businesses is insurance cases.

790
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:14,240
It's a people that are, they're getting
workman's compensation and they're, uh,

791
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:18,270
they're lying and working on the side
and you catch them working. Uh, that's,

792
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,420
you know, or they're suing and they
say, Oh, my back is horribly injured.

793
00:44:22,421 --> 00:44:26,520
And you catch them doing something like
carrying something heavy. And so we,

794
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,800
that's a lot of money. They're saving if
they busted. Yeah. Well a lot of people,

795
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:31,920
they'll claim to be injured if on the job,

796
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,310
you know they have some sort of a job
and so we would have to sit in front of

797
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:35,941
people's houses.

798
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:38,160
We would get there at like four o'clock
in the morning when it was dark out,

799
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:41,840
parked the car and sit and wait for this
guy to go to work cause we had a follow

800
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:42,780
the guy to go to work.

801
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,160
So we'd be in this car bored out of our
heads and we just start talking shit.

802
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,960
And then you know,
it'd be like,

803
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:52,770
yeah I knew this one girl and she was
so fucking crazy and he would tell some

804
00:44:52,771 --> 00:44:56,460
story about a girl he dated. We
would just start howling. And I,

805
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,700
I remember thinking like
crying in his car. He, me,

806
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,530
he and I just sitting there
five o'clock in the morning.

807
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:04,550
I was already doing it at the time.
Yeah.

808
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,830
That was one of the reasons
why I needed a another job.

809
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,520
It's because when I was right when I
was working for him is when I stopped

810
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,720
teaching martial arts and I
stopped competing as well. I,

811
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,970
I got to this point where I was like,
you know what,

812
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,290
I got to pick one thing or the other
and this comedy comedy is what I really

813
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:26,250
want to do and I don't fighting,
it's just going to give any brain damage.

814
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:29,370
Like I got to get away from that and I
got to really focus my energies on this.

815
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,010
I need some sort of a job.
So I quit teaching.

816
00:45:32,011 --> 00:45:36,150
I was teaching at a school
and I was teaching at Boston
University and so I quit

817
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:38,530
all that and then got this
private investigation chop.

818
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,430
What was the craziest thing you
saw on the junk? Nothing crazy.

819
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:46,950
It really wasn't that crazy at all. We
never, we never really were in danger.

820
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:50,400
We never really saw God work in you get
to like confront him or anything? No,

821
00:45:50,401 --> 00:45:52,440
it was that you never would confront them,
you know,

822
00:45:52,441 --> 00:45:54,910
you would just take a picture
of him or you would uh,

823
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:58,020
confirmed that it's them or you know,
it was kind of sad.

824
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,760
Like one time we got this one lady,

825
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:04,680
if I were told the story in the podcast
before about we had this lady and one of

826
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:09,240
the ways he would get information was
he would find someone's address and you

827
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:10,920
know,
like he would know who they were,

828
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,510
he would know like from the
insurance company. Wonderful.

829
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:17,520
Was a woman who was injured
on the job working for Delta.

830
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:22,050
And there was a reason to suspect that
she was still working while she was

831
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:24,630
collecting a workman's compensation.

832
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,710
So we got her address and her license
plate number and then he wrote on a piece

833
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:33,060
of paper her license plate number followed
by a bunch of license plates numbers

834
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:36,720
that were similar to it, close to it. And
then he knocks on the door and he said,

835
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,810
oh yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm
hoping you can help me out.

836
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,690
My girlfriend was in a
car accident and the cops,

837
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,780
they wrote down the license
plate number for the witness,

838
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,000
but someone's spilled some coffee on it.

839
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:52,170
So it's either one of these four numbers
and we checked these two and I'm hoping

840
00:46:52,171 --> 00:46:54,490
it's you. And uh, she would,

841
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:58,110
he would describe an injury that was the
exact same injury is the one this woman

842
00:46:58,111 --> 00:47:01,740
had like, you know, Shashi
herniated a disk and this,

843
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,850
I just recently had that. You're
kidding. Wow. So the woman goes,

844
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:09,300
which you guys like to come
in and have some coffee.
Okay. We're fucking men. Okay.

845
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:12,840
Two men and you know, and I, I, I don't,

846
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,270
I would have never trusted
me at 21 years old.

847
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:19,080
I looked like a fucking psychopath
and he was a nut, you know,

848
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:22,680
he was this crazy nut. It was one to
crash his car and I'll fucking tunnel.

849
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:26,040
And then Ron foot and this nice
lady just invites us into her home.

850
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,280
So we're sitting in a kitchen,
but you like some coffee.
Sure. Thank you very much.

851
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,730
Uh, really, I really hope you can help
me here. You know, because uh, you know,

852
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:37,450
Katie or whatever the girl's name was
that he made up, you know, she's a,

853
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:40,810
she's such a good person and
a, you know, I this, this,

854
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:44,080
this whole thing is just such a tragedy
and she's, well, you know what, honey,

855
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:47,380
I've been through that exact same injury
and I think she's going to be okay.

856
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:51,250
What happened to you? Oh, I fell on the
job. You know, all you're getting paid,

857
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:53,740
right? Oh yes, yes. Not
only am I getting paid,

858
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,950
but I started working for another
airline and my maiden name.

859
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:00,400
So she gives up the ghost, right. And
I'm just sitting there shaking my head.

860
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,310
And so we leave, we get in the car
and I go, you can't turn that lady.

861
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:07,750
And she's too nice. Goes
Fall car. He goes, fuck her.

862
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:11,530
She goes, that's what he kept
saying. I go, really? He goes, fuck.

863
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:14,950
She'd go, she's a fucking crook. He goes,

864
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:18,790
that Nice lady is costing that company
money because she's lying to them about

865
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:22,850
being, Gosh, I'm working with him.
That's a shitty thing to do. She,

866
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,520
she's such a nice lady.

867
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:28,900
I felt I still to this day feel kind of
clever way of doing it. He was a wizard.

868
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,450
He was so good at that. He
was so good. And we would,

869
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,580
it would be different
things for different people.

870
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,240
Like if it was a younger woman,
I would talk to her and you know,

871
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:39,910
he would say like, you know, like,
you know, make it like, you know,

872
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:43,510
you're interested in her and then get some
information out of her. Like we would,

873
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,320
would find out things about like, people
that work there. Do you know Mike?

874
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,950
Are you Mike's Friend and
like, um, do I know you,

875
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,610
I'm Joe a Mike's Friend. I know
you. You're Mike's Friend, right?

876
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,640
I never saw you with Mike.
I not fuck where do I know?

877
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,110
I'm know you from somewhere is
Michael k? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:05,390
Mike's okay. Yeah. Is He, did he
get compensated for that? Yeah.

879
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,660
Or they're taking care of them.
Oh, that's good. That's good.

880
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:09,400
But I already was working for his brother.
She goes,

881
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:13,270
I think that's under the table.
Oh, all right. Yeah. Well fuck.

882
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,490
Tell him I said hi Tom.

883
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:18,220
Joe Says Hi and then the next thing you
know you know about Mike working under

884
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,840
the table.
That sounds like a fun.

885
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,020
I know it probably wasn't at the time
cause no jobs are fun but that sounds like

886
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:26,590
a fun job. It was not the worst
job. It was fun because look,

887
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:29,980
any job could be awesome if you
work with awesome people, you know?

888
00:49:29,981 --> 00:49:34,981
I mean I remember I had a job at Newport
creamery when I was in high school and

889
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:37,180
so like an ice cream place
that flipped hamburgers.

890
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,680
But the boss was a fucking funny guy.
He was a cool guy like,

891
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:44,470
and what I knew he was working
like a certain manager.

892
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:47,410
I'd be psyched to go to work
because it was going to be fun.

893
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,490
You're going to get to have fun.
I always had this shit.

894
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,660
I don't think I've ever had a fun
job ever. I've met quite a few.

895
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:57,280
I've been real lucky and, but this was a
really fun one. That is, you know, it was,

896
00:49:57,281 --> 00:50:01,240
it wasn't like these had to be up at
four o'clock in the morning because you

897
00:50:01,241 --> 00:50:02,790
have to catch people
before they get in the car.

898
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,880
The funny guy being a private investigator
would be like the most fun job.

899
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:10,660
It's scary though. I mean, he's
been attacked before. Um, you know,

900
00:50:10,661 --> 00:50:15,420
I think he got attacked in a case. I don't
remember the story. I think it was, uh,

901
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:20,920
a wife thing. Oh, that was one really
fucked up one. There was this one guy, um,

902
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,880
we, uh, we went to uh,
investigate his, uh,

903
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,830
his girlfriend or his wife.

904
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,420
He had a feeling that his
girlfriend was cheating on him.

905
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:35,140
So he hires Dave and Dave goes and gets
pictures of the girlfriend with this

906
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,470
fucking stud.
This guy's just of gorilla,

907
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:43,370
just some super athlete.
I don't know what the fuck the guy did.

908
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,410
Six foot three, 240 pounds, solid muscle.

909
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:50,690
Looks like he lives in the gym.
Okay.

910
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:54,320
And he's making out with the girl
was squeezing our, picking her up,

911
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:56,690
she's wrapping her legs around,
gets all these pictures,

912
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:59,420
brings him back to the guy.
And the guy starts crying,

913
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:03,380
he starts crying and he was like,
cheaters. Yeah, yeah. And he goes, okay,

914
00:51:03,381 --> 00:51:06,770
keep following him. And he was
like, what? She goes, he goes,

915
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:09,050
I just want to know that this
has happened more than once.

916
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,560
It wasn't just a one time. Thank
you. So then he gets pictures,

917
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:15,650
this guy just gorilla fucking this
shit. God just, just, uh, and he goes,

918
00:51:15,651 --> 00:51:18,440
I want you to keep, he goes,
listen, you sick. Fuck. He goes,

919
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:21,380
I'm not going to keep following
them. And he goes, you look,

920
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:26,360
you got to do what you gotta do, but this
is, I'm done here. You crazy as hell.

921
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,860
You're not, that sounds like a fun job.
I don't know. I wasn't a part of that.

922
00:51:29,861 --> 00:51:33,200
I want, I wasn't a part of it. That was
like wow was working for him. I was,

923
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:36,350
you know, it was in transition and
then like it was like, oh fuck,

924
00:51:36,351 --> 00:51:40,400
I do that for free on the Internet.
But this was the crazy one. You know,

925
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,040
where he could've gotten, you
know, somebody catches it ticket,

926
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:47,640
that would be a more popular one then
the insurance claims. But I guess,

927
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,830
you know, know his well, his, that was,

928
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:56,310
I believe that one came because he was
referred to them by one of the companies

929
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:59,450
that he was,
that he had been successful with.

930
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,620
And so a guy either that worked for the
company or owned the company was the guy

931
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:07,670
who was, it was a rich guy who
he was using and this woman,

932
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,140
he had taken care of her,

933
00:52:09,141 --> 00:52:12,950
he put her up in this beautiful place and
the guy was like super, super wealthy,

934
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:16,730
but he couldn't stop at giant Alpha
Dick from getting in there and said,

935
00:52:16,731 --> 00:52:21,380
he just got fucked. He wanted
us to, well, we want a Dave.

936
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:24,170
This was like, it was like right
when I started working for him.

937
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:26,720
Like I'm maybe hadn't actually
started working for him,

938
00:52:26,721 --> 00:52:30,230
but it was like when we started hanging
out together and it just happened.

939
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,080
And He,
uh,

940
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,250
he had given me that if that's a weird
fetish that he wanted the guy to keep

941
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:38,300
filming it, the Guy Definitely had,
uh, he had a kink going on. There was,

942
00:52:38,301 --> 00:52:42,280
there was a little something he wanted
Dave to keep taking pictures of them.

943
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:46,700
It tastes like, Hey, fuck you. You
know, this is all third job is over.

944
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,170
I'm not giving you jerk off material.
You know,

945
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,390
he's just picture this guy with a finger
up his ass just screaming as he comes

946
00:52:53,391 --> 00:52:57,660
looking at those photos again,
you're just pitching movies here.

947
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,340
It's pretty, yeah, it's
pretty solid script.

948
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:06,740
I'm thinking of add Werewolf who plays
the guy who fingers is his ass. Um,

949
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:11,350
Oh, who's the guy that played um,
pig vomit and how it turned blue. Oh,

950
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:14,200
I sat next to him on a plane recently.
He's awesome. What's his best

951
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:21,140
fucking the guy from sideways?
Come on. You know, I know it.

952
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:26,160
I know it's on the tip of my tongue.
I'll pull up sideways. I just sat

953
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,210
on that like literally sat on
a fucking plane with the gun,

954
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,590
but he would be a good guy for
screaming as he was coming.

955
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,190
I don't want to talk bad about him.
What's wrong with that?

956
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:39,330
It's not bad about them at all. Paul
Giamatti I blanked on that. He's,

957
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:44,190
he's fucking amazing. That guy is, he's
like my favorite pissed off guy ever.

958
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,090
I was sent on a plane with,
I didn't really talk to him,
but a friend of mine who,

959
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,860
who knows him, I emailed
afterwards like, Hey, you know,

960
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:54,300
I sat next to your friend on, on the,
uh, on a flight home and she's like,

961
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,570
emails back. She's like, she said
that you were a very nice gentlemen.

962
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,770
So I bragged all my friends and they
told me that was the lamest thing to brag

963
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:04,800
about. Did they ever heard that
I was just a polite guy? Like,

964
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,470
I'm not supposed to be
an asshole because I do.

965
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:11,820
Paul Giamatti thinks I'm a real nice
gentlemen. That's a good thing. You know,

966
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:14,840
it's probably one of the things that he
says. He was a nice gentleman, basically.

967
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,580
Basically what he's saying
is he didn't remember me. Oh,

968
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,050
you're probably nice to him. And I was
listening to stern in my headphones.

969
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:25,470
That's hilarious. The odds. And so I go,
you know, it just, I didn't want to go.

970
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:28,050
I didn't want to say anything,
but you know, you're great.
And that certain movie.

971
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,160
He's like, oh thank you. He's like, it
was, it was a click in his ear to like,

972
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:36,510
all right gotta stop talking to this guy.
This guy knows who I am, let me know.

973
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:37,344
But he was very nice.

974
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,150
Well I'm sure it gets annoying every now
and then when people associated with it.

975
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,450
You are the character that you played
two called pig vomit and super asshole

976
00:54:45,451 --> 00:54:48,230
boss. You are the best asshole ever. Yeah,

977
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:50,870
he was so fucking great.
And he was,

978
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,900
he was good at being that piston sideways
to this whole train of thought came

979
00:54:56,911 --> 00:55:01,050
from uh, the uh, the question of whether
or not you were funny in high school,

980
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,370
whether you were the funny guy.

981
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,270
That's where we got to my friend Dave
and all this shit that I was saying that

982
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:07,104
too.
Like,

983
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,200
cause that seems to be the question is
everyone thinks if you're a comedian,

984
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,140
like you can listen to me right now
and know that I'm not that funny.

985
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,580
But you could, but you could also like,
I think if you ask my friends back home,

986
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:20,280
you'd be like, Oh yeah, Ben was funny.
But they wouldn't go like, dude,

987
00:55:20,281 --> 00:55:24,410
he was the funniest fuck gun from
Kentucky. Right. Um, I'm, well,

988
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,640
I'm wearing the UK hat to,

989
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:29,310
to a problem for the UK to promote the
fact that they lost in the opening round

990
00:55:29,311 --> 00:55:33,540
of the nit yesterday and are completely
out of March madness. But by the way,

991
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:36,000
I don't even know what the fuck. And even
what you just said me, you don't know.

992
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:40,170
You Watch college basketball. Well,
there's people listening right now.

993
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:43,390
We're talking shit about me. So I decided
to show some, they were now there.

994
00:55:43,391 --> 00:55:46,470
There'll be talking shit when they hear
him hear this. Well how rude of them.

995
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,920
Yeah. Those fuckers up. I was going to
ask before to, not to not talk about me,

996
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:54,270
but you're a, you're going to
Nashville. How do you go there much? No,

997
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:56,640
I haven't been there in a while.
That's when my mom's from.

998
00:55:56,641 --> 00:56:00,410
I go there all the time. I love it.
I love it there. But there's, I've,

999
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:04,220
I've just put out a new special
about a couple months ago, September,

1000
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:07,290
something like five bucks, right?
Yeah. Five bucks on Joe rogan.net.

1001
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,290
It's called live from the Tabernacle.
And uh,

1002
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:13,380
I basically put together
the next hour or running,

1003
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:16,140
but I have a bunch of new
shit that I want to work out.

1004
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,070
And so the best way for me to do that
is to do a club that I don't go to very

1005
00:56:20,071 --> 00:56:24,220
often. Cool. And I haven't been to
this place and like more than a year,

1006
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,320
like I think it's like two years
since the last time at van.

1007
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:31,520
And this club's Zane, he's in Nashville.
You ever been there? I remember I just, I,

1008
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:34,310
I go to my grandma's house and
shit. I don't really, again,

1009
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,350
Zany is fucking awesome comedy club.
It's like really tight seating.

1010
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:42,220
There's a balcony but it's low.
It's like they're right on top of you.

1011
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:46,870
It's an amazing club. And Nashville
is like, it's a rare town man.

1012
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:48,400
Cause it's really smart.

1013
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:53,490
It's a weird combination of southern
and smart and hip and a lot of musicians

1014
00:56:54,401 --> 00:56:58,810
and artists and in Nashville it's bad ass.
Ralphie may lives there now,

1015
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:01,240
doesn't he? Like he splits
time. I think he goes back.

1016
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,410
There's a lot of rock stars living there
now. Did you know that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1017
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:09,970
Well honey, honey just moved there too
and black keys there and all those people.

1018
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:14,460
Yeah. Yeah. Well it's a great creative
environment for that and I don't know man,

1019
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:18,640
I guess for comedy to you all you need
for comedies like one club, that's good.

1020
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:22,540
And they have that. They got Zucchinis,
which has been there for 30 years,

1021
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:22,990
you know,

1022
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:26,680
I think they just saw addicted a whiskey
and they just have to be near Jack

1023
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,390
Daniels or something. You can
get that shit everywhere. So on.

1024
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:29,380
That's not difficult to get.

1025
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:34,180
You wouldn't have to move close to get
anybody here hear like old country level

1026
00:57:34,181 --> 00:57:37,630
country Merle haggard. You been to the
country Music Hall of fame there? No,

1027
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,320
I had never been, but I was there
one time. Usually I stay with family,

1028
00:57:41,321 --> 00:57:44,320
but it was a family member's wedding,
so there was no place for me to say.

1029
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:46,150
So I had to stay at a hotel
and I had the day off.

1030
00:57:46,151 --> 00:57:49,270
So I went to the country music hall of
fame next door. It was fucking awesome.

1031
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:51,550
Wasn't really, it was. I thought I
was going to be stupid, you know,

1032
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:55,030
and Garth Brooks Shit and all that.
It was like old school Hank Williams,

1033
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,340
like a lot of the old, it was really cool.
If you've got time I would go to the,

1034
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:01,990
Brooks is slowly becoming
some classic so like you know,

1035
00:58:01,991 --> 00:58:06,090
hey you have classic rock. I got
friends in low places. Could be a car.

1036
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,580
It's weird you say that.
Cause I was,

1037
00:58:08,581 --> 00:58:10,900
I was at the capitol records
building a while ago,

1038
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:12,540
just kind of friend and worked
there and they had this,

1039
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:16,510
these plaques on the wall of like every
album that has sold 10 million copies.

1040
00:58:16,511 --> 00:58:19,630
Right. Which is not that many.
So you go to the capitol records,

1041
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:21,820
they were like four Beatles records,

1042
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:25,360
dark side of the moon and
just a wall of gardens.

1043
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:29,050
Like you don't realize how
many fucking albums, his stuff.

1044
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:32,880
So he had like six albums that sold 10
like you wonder why you don't hear from

1045
00:58:32,881 --> 00:58:37,300
him anymore because he's got more fucking
money than any music in Vegas now.

1046
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:39,620
I think he's started doing
concerts in Vegas like,

1047
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:40,840
but just with an acoustic guitar.

1048
00:58:40,841 --> 00:58:45,280
I think really like it's just him with a
guitar. Yeah. Listen, he's a weird fuck,

1049
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,320
but he's undeniably talented.
Oh,

1050
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,260
you can't sell that many records
and not have something going on.

1051
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:53,530
I got friends in low places
is a great fucking song.

1052
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:56,950
If you've got a buzz on and that song
comes on and you don't get happy,

1053
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:00,910
you're a cunt. Well, if you're that,
that's a little harsh, but I, I agree,

1054
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,260
but know where I'm from.
If you're,

1055
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,690
if you're drinking and somebody
doesn't put that on the Jukebox,

1056
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:08,020
like something's wrong.
CanNot take that. So

1057
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,730
of course he can't. You're from Ohio. You
probably heard it every day. Your Life.

1058
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,430
Where in Ohio,
your alarm clock every day.

1059
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,560
Do you remember when he
did that weird thing?

1060
00:59:17,561 --> 00:59:21,950
Garth Brooks stood where he put on a
wig and pretend to be a different dude.

1061
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,320
He was Chris. Chris Gaines.
Yeah, something like that. God,

1062
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:28,920
that was the weirdest thing ever.
Fuck was that about when I see

1063
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,080
plaques on the wall at Capitol records,
I'm like, no wonder he did that.

1064
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:32,690
He was just,

1065
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:35,860
yeah, look at that. Come on, man. Who Let,

1066
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:40,700
who let you do that? Garth Brooks,
he grew a little flavor saver.

1067
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,800
He little flavor saver
under the lower lip.

1068
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:46,370
Any went total emo Weirdo,

1069
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,030
like brooding that looks like he was in
an argument with his label. He's like,

1070
00:59:50,031 --> 00:59:52,430
look, you fuckers, I could sell
albums doing anything. I'll fuck.

1071
00:59:52,431 --> 00:59:56,030
I want changed my name. Put a Goto
and then that's what he thought.

1072
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,450
He really did believe that. I think
that wasn't it. Was that his last album?

1073
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,890
Boy, that's a shitty way to
go out. If that's his last.

1074
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:08,290
That was like the does fix yourself.
I'm all with the hair just perfectly.

1075
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:12,710
That's fine. If we don't
know it's a fucking wig man.
You can't just wear a wig.

1076
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:14,420
Okay.
That's ridiculous.

1077
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:18,550
That looks, but remember for a while
and SNL that was like the Goto joke.

1078
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,900
What it was doing weekend update was
like every joke has like a Chris.

1079
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,520
He's like,
go fucking silly.

1080
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:29,521
He is the idea that he thought that he
could pretend to be someone different,

1081
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:33,080
a different personality.
I'm not the happy country guy anymore,

1082
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:36,980
even though it's the same guy inside my
heart. When I'm Chris Gaines, I'm Moody's.

1083
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,000
Fuck, okay. I'm all dressed in black
and white flavor. Say Rive died.

1084
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:45,020
That and my hair. It's all thick and
heavy even though you know I'm going bald.

1085
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:48,650
Don't think about that. Don't
think about the wig, man.

1086
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:53,300
Think about the persona. I'm trying
to sell a persona. I got this down.

1087
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:56,510
It's God damn character.
You're going to love my new CD.

1088
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,630
It's Chris Gaines is moody as fuck.
That's what it's called.

1089
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,930
I want you to concentrate. I want you
to concentrate on the shitty music.

1090
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:06,300
This time. My shitty looks
to of me, but one hire.

1091
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:13,600
Who Do we become when mood and
like who wrote these shitty songs?

1092
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:17,480
Chris Gaines. Brooks. Yeah.

1093
01:01:17,481 --> 01:01:20,570
He became like one of those Stephen
King characters were fucking,

1094
01:01:20,571 --> 01:01:24,830
his eyes glaze over when he starts
writing and he starts going to gloss over

1095
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:26,530
Lelea and writing a bunch of shit down,

1096
01:01:26,531 --> 01:01:29,000
like the dark half memory had
a tumor or something like that.

1097
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:32,240
Yeah. I wonder if he's one of those
guys like you know Michael Jackson,

1098
01:01:32,241 --> 01:01:34,610
like someone who goes super
crazy when they get super famous.

1099
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:35,480
I wonder if he did that,

1100
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:38,540
but just did it out of the spotlight
because he was as famous as those guys in

1101
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:41,210
his hay day and you never
heard of a freak out from him.

1102
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:43,210
Oh, maybe that Alpha, this version.

1103
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:47,140
He left his wife for a while and got
some new hottie or something like that.

1104
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:51,850
Another singer for something. But that
shit's normal. That's impossible to avoid.

1105
01:01:51,851 --> 01:01:54,670
When you got the kind of Garth
Brooks Pussy, you going your way?

1106
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,870
What are you going to count? Pussy.
They're thrown at him. Pre-Internet son.

1107
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,950
All my goodness. It was just
tsunamis. Pussy and country.

1108
01:02:02,951 --> 01:02:07,890
Pussy is hard to avoid man.
Sweet girls with like [inaudible] son.

1109
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:11,890
Don't lie to me. Ben Hoffman was
coming your way. Country my way. Yeah.

1110
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,720
Solid d natural tits that defy gravity.
What am I saying son?

1111
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:21,510
I grew up in Kentucky and with that all
around me, none of it offered to me.

1112
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,450
Not once. How about now? How
about you got a little TV show.

1113
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:26,130
You got a little little
sun coming your way.

1114
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:29,250
It's not helping as much as I was hoping
it would. You don't have a regular gal?

1115
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:32,670
No. Um, Ben Hoffman. That's
ridiculous. Hey handsome fellow.

1116
01:02:32,671 --> 01:02:37,110
You're quick with your wit. Hey ladies,
if you're on Ustream and you're not to be,

1117
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:40,080
I got to live tweet my show tonight
so I'm busy to like till like eight,

1118
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:43,220
but after that we'll meet up and we'll

1119
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:49,740
have a few beverages drinks on me. Whoa.
Drinks on him. Yeah, he got my own show.

1120
01:02:49,741 --> 01:02:51,960
I got money for drinks. Yeah. And
you could find them on Twitter.

1121
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:55,200
What's your Twitter handle at the Ben
Show? Which is a mistake by the way.

1122
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,210
Just cause I realized now I shouldn't
have my Twitter name be the name of the

1123
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:04,560
show because it will show people say,
well no I don't care about that.

1124
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:07,890
Which why would you not care about that?
Because I think dementia is quit.

1125
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:11,850
That'd be cool. Yeah. No, I don't
want, I don't want to shake it. No,

1126
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,050
I'm just saying people say follow or
it's like watch at the bench show and

1127
01:03:16,051 --> 01:03:19,770
they're, what they're saying is watch
Ben Hoffman. You know what I'm saying?

1128
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:24,210
So it gets confusing. Watch the watch at
the bench show on the bencher. Ooh. Yeah.

1129
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:27,500
I'd never thought about that. Change
it. I know people changed it before,

1130
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:28,700
but then I changed.
Mine acts,

1131
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:33,660
there's some loser who has been Hoffman
and he's got 30,000 followers and he

1132
01:03:33,661 --> 01:03:37,790
follows 50,000 people. How does he have
30,000 followers? Because he fought.

1133
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,530
I'm sure he followed all those bots
who followed and followed them back or

1134
01:03:40,531 --> 01:03:44,220
something. I tried to get his name from
him, but I, he won't give it to you.

1135
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,290
Twitter.
It'll give it to,

1136
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,660
do you know that Twitter will
just steal it from that guy? Yeah,

1137
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:49,650
they do that for celebrities.

1138
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,940
We got to see if we get a season two
before we start stealing Twitter.

1139
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:56,370
I think I knew. I think I need some
more power before I get that season two,

1140
01:03:56,430 --> 01:04:00,110
what you need is Ben Hoffman's name
you got, that's your name, right? Yeah.

1141
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:03,660
You're Ben Hoffman. Yeah. Fuck is
this guy really been bad than an hour?

1142
01:04:03,661 --> 01:04:08,070
And he asked my name. Huh? No, I'm
kidding. Is this Guy Really Ben Hoffman?

1143
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:09,670
Is that his real name?
He's,

1144
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:14,190
he claims he's been Hoffman got to
find out when we take care of this.

1145
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,740
I've got my people get on it right
now. People move in on him. Yeah.

1146
01:04:17,741 --> 01:04:20,720
Cause you're right. At least making them
uncomfortable with a few emails. Yeah,

1147
01:04:20,721 --> 01:04:21,331
I did that once.

1148
01:04:21,331 --> 01:04:24,930
Someone had Ben hoffman.com
and I threatened to sue
him and he's like bring it

1149
01:04:24,931 --> 01:04:26,160
on. And I didn't have lawyers. Right.

1150
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:28,770
Cause I guess like I guess
his name Ben Hoffman. Yeah.

1151
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,340
Oh then you can't sell them. I know.
I threatened to out him that funny.

1152
01:04:32,341 --> 01:04:34,110
Like you would think they
will because you're famous.

1153
01:04:34,111 --> 01:04:37,080
You're Ben Hoffman name was worth more
than his. Well I check the ratings.

1154
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:41,190
I'm not sure how famous I am. You know
how long ago was this? How famous I am?

1155
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:44,550
How long ago was this that the guy
had been hopping before I had a show.

1156
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,520
So you weren't famous at all? I
was nuts. Thread is trolling paper.

1157
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,110
But that was back when I was, it didn't
have a show. I pretended to be famous.

1158
01:04:52,111 --> 01:04:54,820
I would email him like, listen, I'm a big
celebrity and you can't have my website.

1159
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:59,370
I was on another show at the time, so
I was like, listen, I have, I'm on TV.

1160
01:04:59,371 --> 01:05:02,410
Belbin they're like, we don't give a
fuck. I don't care who you are. And like,

1161
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,200
and then I did you think you actually had
to like a, like you could do something.

1162
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,210
I knew I was talking shit.

1163
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:10,110
I was just hoping that he would get
scared and be like, Oh shit, it's yours.

1164
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:13,470
And he was like, had half a brain and
it was like, damn it. Leave me alone.

1165
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:17,410
Half a brain. Shit. That's fucking half
brain. I mean, he had the brain I have,

1166
01:05:17,411 --> 01:05:18,244
which is,
you know,

1167
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:18,680
you have,

1168
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:23,230
there's a guy that's on the Joe rogan.com
and apparently I did not ask for this

1169
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:24,430
and please stop doing it.

1170
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:29,320
But people send him horrible things
and including like someone brought some

1171
01:05:29,321 --> 01:05:31,720
whole thing about him. He's a
real estate agent. Wait a second.

1172
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:33,670
He has Joe rogan.com
[inaudible] name's Joe Rogan.

1173
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,760
Joe rogan.com it says name
your Joe rogan.net. Yes. All
right. It's his name. Yeah,

1174
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:39,611
you wanted to sell it to me,

1175
01:05:39,611 --> 01:05:43,810
but he wanted just some fucking ridiculous
amount of money rides. How much?

1176
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,230
It was more than $80,000 or something like
fuck off. Something crazy. It was like,

1177
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:50,920
what I, it's not hard to find me.

1178
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,820
You know Madonna one that
lost find me through Google,
but that, no, it's his name.

1179
01:05:54,821 --> 01:05:57,490
His name is Joe Rogan,
but people sent him,

1180
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,580
if they wrote something up about
don't do that pride and take that off.

1181
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,720
Take that off. Come on. I
don't want to pick on the guy.

1182
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:07,660
It's just his name.
You know the guy is a real estate guy,

1183
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:10,780
but people send them rude shit. Whoever
sending him rude shit, please stop.

1184
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:13,090
It's not a bad guy.
Just doesn't want to give up his thing.

1185
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:16,120
So he said he would give it up for a
shitload of money and he doesn't have to

1186
01:06:16,121 --> 01:06:18,910
give it up at all. Why should he do it
for less than that? He doesn't want to,

1187
01:06:18,911 --> 01:06:21,730
it's this business, you know, I don't
have a problem with it. I'm with you.

1188
01:06:21,731 --> 01:06:24,670
But that, but saying that large
amount is to me I knowing,

1189
01:06:24,671 --> 01:06:27,760
but I get what he's saying is I
don't want to give it up. Yeah,

1190
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:29,270
he doesn't wanna give it up.
So he says,

1191
01:06:29,271 --> 01:06:32,890
oh I'll give it up but I want like a
year salary. That's like, you know,

1192
01:06:32,891 --> 01:06:33,650
there's nothing wrong with it.

1193
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:36,280
I guess it makes sense cause he's like
this is how I could make my money,

1194
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:39,050
my business. If you're going to pay for
my business, I'll give you the name.

1195
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,960
And as far as like website domains go,

1196
01:06:40,961 --> 01:06:44,500
like there's been website domain names
like business.com it wasn't that sold for

1197
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:45,550
like millions of dollars.

1198
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:48,220
Oh there was a bunch of people right when
the Internet started who made millions

1199
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:50,290
like before that was became
because that's illegal now.

1200
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,880
How did you not do that Brian?

1201
01:06:51,881 --> 01:06:55,690
It seems like something you would be
jumped on a bunch of cool domain names and

1202
01:06:55,691 --> 01:06:56,330
sell them.

1203
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:59,660
I have like 30 domain names.
I just don't sell them. Yeah.

1204
01:06:59,661 --> 01:07:02,840
But I mean like a really cool one
that's valuable. I have a bunch,

1205
01:07:02,841 --> 01:07:05,200
I have a Coca-Cola dot com yeah,

1206
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:08,090
but why wouldn't you like put them
up for sale if you have a bunch that,

1207
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:08,870
cause I think,

1208
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:13,520
I think it's something that it's fun to
collect kind of like like a old comic

1209
01:07:13,521 --> 01:07:14,000
books,

1210
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,940
but I'm not really sure yet if any that
you think could make some serious cash.

1211
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,760
Yeah, I think so. Well one of the
funniest lines with Brian ever did was it

1212
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:22,490
then called Pepsi Spice. Do
you remember? Pepsi spies?

1213
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:28,080
Pepsi spice was some fucking bizarre
idea that someone at Pepsi came out with

1214
01:07:29,631 --> 01:07:32,880
where it's like it was
like a holiday Pepsi. Yeah.

1215
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:37,220
It was like just the name sounds gross.
It was gross. It was gross. So anyway,

1216
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:43,040
Brian Buys Pepsi spice.com and puts up
this daily blog of him slowly darn of

1217
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:46,830
horrible disease.
Ease

1218
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:52,840
these spice for 30 days. Pepsi's spice
for 30 days. It was one of my favorite,

1219
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:55,410
like things supersize me,

1220
01:07:55,411 --> 01:07:59,940
but with Pepsi Spice Spice and this was
probably before supersize and this was

1221
01:07:59,941 --> 01:08:04,290
right during supersize me cause I
actually got it based off that. Oh,

1222
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:06,420
you got the idea from that. Okay.
Yeah, because I was like, all right,

1223
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:10,400
I might do something where he's
Dad, what you was supersize me? Uh,

1224
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:15,500
I think it was, well this is a, that came
out, this was like 2002, right? Yeah,

1225
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:16,610
it was 2004.

1226
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,770
2004. Yeah. And, and I,
you know, if there was,

1227
01:08:18,771 --> 01:08:21,860
it was on like all the websites I got
interviewed and rate for radio stations

1228
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:25,070
and then it got to the point
at the very end where, uh,

1229
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,360
the girl I was living with, which was
the Lindsey Lohan at the time, uh,

1230
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:32,810
she said she was saying that
it was a really sick and
dying. Lindsay Lohan. No, no,

1231
01:08:32,811 --> 01:08:34,460
that's what I said in the,
in the blog

1232
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:40,980
I had about 50 questions clarify that
Lindsay's people on the phone right now.

1233
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,350
Lindsay says, hi, Lindsey is over and she
is helping me drink my 10th, two liters.

1234
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:49,190
Ended up coming to La for the day,
right over some mo cane,

1235
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:53,420
which was when I used to say
that I used to break up, uh,

1236
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,700
mushrooms and mix it with
cocaine and snort it.

1237
01:08:55,701 --> 01:08:57,380
And I used to call it and cocaine.
I mean,

1238
01:08:57,381 --> 01:09:01,820
Lindsay would sit around and do mo cane
all the time. Pepsi Spice Blog. Yeah.

1239
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,760
And then I ended up just dying and I
started getting like clogged armpits

1240
01:09:04,761 --> 01:09:08,810
because there was so much Pepsi spice
that armpit started getting this huge rash

1241
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:12,800
and they're getting clogged and then
bow wow was helping me out with money or

1242
01:09:12,801 --> 01:09:15,120
something. Like I can't
remember, but it was really fun.

1243
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:18,140
Here's why I liked that so much too.

1244
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,140
Why is that any different
than supersize me really?

1245
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:24,200
Because why would you think eating
nothing but Mcdonald's is any more or less

1246
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:27,810
healthy than Pepsi spice? It's
almost mocking that movie. You know,

1247
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,890
a lot of people have disputed that
supersize me guys claims I know a lot of

1248
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,080
interesting. Um, I want an, you know, I,

1249
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:38,830
I would have thought that there's no way.
Like he wouldn't be bullshitting.

1250
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,390
Like the,
there's the results wouldn't be that bad.

1251
01:09:41,391 --> 01:09:44,240
I mean it seems similar or
would definitely be that bad.

1252
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:49,160
But then I watched a show, Marie had
that show 30 days. Yeah. It was kind of,

1253
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:51,010
I saw some fuckery in that show.
No,

1254
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,330
I felt bullshit when I was
watching the documentary.

1255
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,360
Like what he threw up very early in
the film. I don't know if you remember,

1256
01:09:56,361 --> 01:09:59,870
you were studying it to build. Yeah. Yeah.
I, you know, I never really thought of it,

1257
01:09:59,871 --> 01:10:02,990
if any of the show being fake because I
actually watched all of his shows like

1258
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:05,090
the 30 day shows and I
actually enjoy all of them.

1259
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:08,120
I never really looked at him like,
oh, this is fake. No, I know. I know.

1260
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:10,300
One of them is fake and
this is how I know it. He,

1261
01:10:10,301 --> 01:10:13,860
he did one on hormone
replacement therapy and he used,

1262
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:18,890
while he tried to use a doctor
that I know and the doctor said,

1263
01:10:18,891 --> 01:10:20,900
there's no way I would ever do that.
He goes,

1264
01:10:20,901 --> 01:10:23,540
do you're asking for something
completely unethical? He goes,

1265
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:26,630
if a guy wants to get on hormone
replacement therapy, first of all,

1266
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:30,710
why would he want to do that in his
thirties he guys like 33 years old in this

1267
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:34,040
television show and he goes, and second
of all, you don't do it in 30 days.

1268
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:34,401
He goes,
he,

1269
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:38,660
he wouldn't even start it from months
like before you do anything where you give

1270
01:10:38,661 --> 01:10:40,220
the guy hormones,

1271
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:44,300
you got to figure out a way how to
optimize his own body's production of

1272
01:10:44,301 --> 01:10:46,340
hormones. That's the most,
the only way to do it,

1273
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:50,240
but I'm sure there's doctors that would
do it. You know Hollywood doctors.

1274
01:10:50,241 --> 01:10:52,520
I know how the doctor that
does not listening to me,

1275
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:57,230
but the reason why it's
bullshit is because the only
types of doctors that were

1276
01:10:57,231 --> 01:11:00,890
willing to do what he was asking them
to do, we're completely unethical.

1277
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:05,690
So they made these conclusions on the
show about what replacing your hormones

1278
01:11:05,691 --> 01:11:06,524
are all about.

1279
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:10,700
Completely based on unethical doctors
willing to fit within their production

1280
01:11:10,701 --> 01:11:14,160
schedule. That's an unethical show.
That's a show. That's bullshit. Because

1281
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,390
the dot. Yeah, exactly what you're saying.

1282
01:11:15,391 --> 01:11:19,440
The doctor who did it is fueling
lies to me to be on TV, to get more,

1283
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:22,610
and you're spewing lies in
order to produce a show.

1284
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:26,960
Then the parameters of your 30 day
time limit, it's stupid. I watched it.

1285
01:11:26,961 --> 01:11:30,170
I was gone. No doctor would
just give you testosterone.

1286
01:11:30,171 --> 01:11:33,130
They don't look at your test levels
and say, oh, your levels are low. Uh,

1287
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,600
you're 35 years old. What's
going on? Do you sleep?

1288
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:38,120
They would start looking at
you. You're fat. First of all,

1289
01:11:38,121 --> 01:11:41,900
you've got to get all this
shit out of your body. Okay,
what are you eating? Okay,

1290
01:11:41,901 --> 01:11:46,720
stop eating that. Starting this. You
need to eat spinach. Do drink water. Oh,

1291
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:49,370
they would be crazy to do that.
You're going to break the guy's system.

1292
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,290
You would never do that.
And so in the show,

1293
01:11:51,291 --> 01:11:53,600
the guy that gets angry
and starts fucking throat,

1294
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,240
well there's somebody just shot
him up with testosterone. I'm like,

1295
01:11:56,241 --> 01:11:57,480
he doesn't know what the fuck is going on.

1296
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:00,080
This is not a balanced that in his body.
And he doesn't even know.

1297
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,810
I remember watching that. I mean,
I dunno if he could be a good guy.

1298
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,470
I mean Nice Guy, you know,
whatever. With music,

1299
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:09,740
I started watching like
watching the movie, like some
Mcdonald's is bad for you.

1300
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:12,170
That's the, that's the takeaway
from this film. I mean,

1301
01:12:12,171 --> 01:12:14,510
that's why I like the Pepsi Spice thing.
It's like no shit.

1302
01:12:14,511 --> 01:12:17,020
If you just live on mcdonalds,
you'll vote on Pepsi spice.

1303
01:12:17,021 --> 01:12:18,370
You're going to fucking, exactly. It's,

1304
01:12:18,371 --> 01:12:20,250
you're not supposed to be something
that you live on every month.

1305
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:23,000
I don't think the President Mcdonald
would say eat at every meal every day for

1306
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:23,140
it.

1307
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:27,980
30. But the, uh, the, the
idea that his whole life,

1308
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:31,030
he was like ready to die because
of it. Man. I'm not buying that.

1309
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:33,170
No. Well, I was, a
friend of mine was like,

1310
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:36,980
I was going to go see the movie and
he's like, no, that's bullshit. I said,

1311
01:12:36,981 --> 01:12:38,390
well how do you know?
He's like, cause I was,

1312
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:42,170
I lived in this apartment once and my
dad had a job out of nowhere and I didn't

1313
01:12:42,171 --> 01:12:42,890
have a car.

1314
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:46,100
So I had to live right by Mcdonald's and
I ate McDonald's every meal every day

1315
01:12:46,101 --> 01:12:47,120
for like 60 days,

1316
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,430
and I'm here to talk about it because
of what the fuck are you talking?

1317
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:54,070
Yeah. Okay. There's, there actually
is quite a bit of criticism

1318
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:58,770
of that online of the, that
movie. Yeah. Oh, I'm sure.

1319
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:03,480
Yeah. Supersize me is not the scathing
and factual indictment of the fast food

1320
01:13:03,481 --> 01:13:06,630
industry that Morgan Spurlock
wants it to be. Yeah. There's a,

1321
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:10,020
there's quite a few people that, that
looked at this and said that this doesn't,

1322
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:14,220
doesn't align up sponsored by Mcdonald's.
Yeah. Look, it's interesting, you know,

1323
01:13:14,221 --> 01:13:17,100
it's always interesting when you
find out how little nutrition is in

1324
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:22,170
positives. If it gets the word out, the
fat, you shouldn't eat a lot of fast food.

1325
01:13:22,171 --> 01:13:25,460
That's a good thing. But you don't
want it to do it through. Right.

1326
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:29,700
Bullshit. We have a real sickness in
the society where we, we need fast food.

1327
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:31,710
You know, when you're
in your car, I fucking,

1328
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:33,360
he was pulling and grab a
burger real quick. Like,

1329
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:37,200
I mean it's nice that you can do that.
But man,

1330
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:40,770
we need to figure out a way to
fucking relax a little. You know, the,

1331
01:13:40,771 --> 01:13:44,490
the older I get, especially when I'm
running around, I need to get a coffee.

1332
01:13:44,491 --> 01:13:47,040
I gotta be here on time.
Do I really need to be there on time?

1333
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:50,130
Do I really need to get a cup of coffee?
What I really need to do is not be,

1334
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:51,950
it's fucking busy like this,

1335
01:13:51,951 --> 01:13:55,320
this craziness of being stuck in traffic
and not being able to get home for two

1336
01:13:55,321 --> 01:13:57,150
hours.
So you pull into in and out Burger,

1337
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:00,660
whatever we all really need to do is
figure out a way to never be in fucking

1338
01:14:00,661 --> 01:14:03,930
traffic for two hours every day of
the week. Cause that's craziness.

1339
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,470
And that's a big part of everybody's
reality. And if that's your reality,

1340
01:14:07,471 --> 01:14:10,950
then it's also possible that your reality
is cheeseburgers that grab a quick

1341
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,160
meal,
coffee

1342
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,440
in the morning because you're
fucking sleeping. You know,

1343
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:17,680
you got to throw down a 20 ounce coffee
on the way to work just to wake the fuck

1344
01:14:17,681 --> 01:14:20,800
up that damned espresso machine I was
telling you about that my parents got me.

1345
01:14:20,801 --> 01:14:24,070
That's ruining my life. My wife got me
one for Christmas a couple years ago.

1346
01:14:24,071 --> 01:14:27,040
I use it more than anything anybody's
ever bought me ever except this game of

1347
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:27,874
Thrones box

1348
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:35,210
your luck. It's bad
ass. That's really cool.

1349
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:39,530
Sorry. It's pretty, you're
a bed show box show up yet.

1350
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:44,690
Not yet. It will be there. So what's that?
Um, not season two. It's all the calm.

1351
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:48,290
They scraped off from that show.
Girls put her in a mayonnaise jar.

1352
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,770
It's imagine if you saved all your com.

1353
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:55,820
Has anyone ever done that from the time
they were like a young man tough today?

1354
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:59,540
Like no, it's mine. Just have a
jug by the bed. He Jack off into it

1355
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,800
cause I, I, I've done that
and that weird that I'm here.

1356
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:07,240
I've done it for a couple of weeks.
It's a kid a couple of weeks. Yeah.

1357
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:09,680
Where you would to like
have like a mountain dew can
not when you're a kid you'd

1358
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:13,450
just like to throw it in. By the way, are
you not joking now when I was younger,

1359
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:17,530
when I was younger, like when I'm
saying 38 something like that,

1360
01:15:17,531 --> 01:15:21,130
like I remember you and you're fine with
this on iTunes and Ustream long as it

1361
01:15:21,131 --> 01:15:22,960
doesn't get on stitcher and other thing.

1362
01:15:22,961 --> 01:15:27,430
Is that what was even grocer is that I
even have a bit about how I used to fuck

1363
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:30,820
pillows and I would fuck my pillows all
the time and then my mom would have to

1364
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:35,110
take my pillowcases off and I just
remember looking at my pillow cases like,

1365
01:15:35,111 --> 01:15:38,930
man that looks so gross. It's just like
covered yellow and it's gotten hard.

1366
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:42,130
My housekeeper found one of my old
tee shirts wants that wasn't a fun

1367
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:46,100
conversation. What did she
say to you? Yes. She's like, I

1368
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:54,370
know she, she just cleaned it. She was
like, here's your shirt. I was like,

1369
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:58,000
I don't want to wear the shirts.
Good to me. That's it. You're scared.

1370
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:03,610
He's scared of the loads. Know, but that's
not a shirt you wear to high school.

1371
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:06,520
I always thought it'd be a funny thing
if like you're in a hurry in the morning

1372
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:09,580
and you just grabbed a shirt real fast
and you get to school and realize it's

1373
01:16:09,581 --> 01:16:13,110
your comrade. You have to,
where are we playing games?

1374
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:16,720
Jerk off. We're pretending he
doesn't jerk off. We all jerk off.

1375
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,250
You might as well go to school with a
fucking load stained shirt. Who Cares?

1376
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:23,910
I think I might have one on right now.
That's a new cool thing.

1377
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,670
I'm going to come on this house Rogan
shirt and bring it back tomorrow.

1378
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:29,790
I don't give a shit.
We should wear each other's shirts.

1379
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:36,670
Fuck you man. He just creeped me out.
You're wearing a higher prime nature,

1380
01:16:36,671 --> 01:16:37,310
by the way.

1381
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:40,740
Those who have been restocked higher
prime at all of them had been restocked.

1382
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:44,560
Yeah. That's a dope one. Cool. Sure. Yeah.
I got a tee shirt company. It's small.

1383
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:47,860
Mostly monkeys and psychedelics.
That's the whole thing.

1384
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:52,300
I love to call higher
primates, higher-primate.com
not on the website. Yeah.

1385
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:55,760
Then you do real estate too,
right? No, not anymore. Now I'm,

1386
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:59,110
I catered only to the gay community.
That's somewhat something someone created,

1387
01:16:59,111 --> 01:17:02,230
like the whole pamphlet about this kind
of catering only to the gay community or

1388
01:17:02,231 --> 01:17:03,640
they put it out online.

1389
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:05,810
Jayda pull your new
kicking ass on that pole.

1390
01:17:05,811 --> 01:17:09,470
I think since we talked about the poll
yesterday, you're, you're now up, oh,

1391
01:17:09,471 --> 01:17:10,304
let's hold,

1392
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:12,900
oh,
Annie's the training MMA fighter.

1393
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:15,690
Okay. Okay. Can I get your back
on that for one second? Again,

1394
01:17:15,691 --> 01:17:18,240
I don't like to kiss ass,
but I saw that interview

1395
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,620
because I was listening to that one.
But I also saw there was with the hands,

1396
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:25,160
but I was watching the clip that they
were apparently who was somebody was

1397
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:27,570
pissed at you about that. I
don't know. But you were very,

1398
01:17:27,571 --> 01:17:32,010
you were almost like knew that the clip
was going to get out on most and you

1399
01:17:32,011 --> 01:17:34,980
were like very politically correct.
And what you said in a weird way,

1400
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:37,080
like you don't forget,
you said transgender.

1401
01:17:37,081 --> 01:17:41,520
Even like there's nothing controversial
about what you said. Well,

1402
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:45,650
I'm not, you know, I'm not an
insensitive person. You know,

1403
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:48,990
even though I'm a comedian, when I'm
talking seriously about a subject,

1404
01:17:48,991 --> 01:17:50,670
if I was on stage,
I might say tranny,

1405
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:53,730
but I don't want to be disrespectful
to what someone's choices.

1406
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:57,470
If I call you a tranny, I wish we were
good enough friends. We could fuck it.

1407
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:02,310
Take it. Okay. I wish that
I could call you a trainee
and you would, uh, you would,

1408
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:04,940
you would laugh it off and
just be happy to be who are,

1409
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,390
but just the fact that you knew to say,

1410
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:09,370
cause I'm learning this on comedy
central through standards and practices,

1411
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:12,760
what you're supposed to say and that
suppose not trying to say training,

1412
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,720
but I was impressed.

1413
01:18:14,721 --> 01:18:18,990
He said transgender and
all you said was that, uh,

1414
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,750
they shouldn't be this woman.

1415
01:18:21,751 --> 01:18:25,920
You even called her a woman shouldn't
be allowed to fight or this, this, no,

1416
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,410
you called her woman. You said she,
she shouldn't be allowed to fight men.

1417
01:18:28,411 --> 01:18:29,840
That's not fair.
Well,

1418
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:32,390
no, she shouldn't be allowed to fight.
We'll fight women. Yeah, I'm sorry.

1419
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:36,820
And by the way, she fought women without
disclosing the fact that she used again.

1420
01:18:36,821 --> 01:18:39,080
So that's lying.
And there's doctors that are saying,

1421
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:43,010
this is something that we talked about
this yesterday, but just in the, you know,

1422
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,280
the possibility that no one
heard that or people listening,

1423
01:18:46,281 --> 01:18:50,210
some of you haven't heard that there's
a mechanical advantages to being a man

1424
01:18:50,211 --> 01:18:53,410
that are absolutely undeniable.
The size of the hands, the,

1425
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,930
the width of the shoulders,
the,

1426
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:58,430
the fact that you've had testosterone
freely flowing through your body for 30

1427
01:18:58,431 --> 01:19:02,750
years. 30 years. Yes. When
you go on hormone replacement
therapy and take estrogen,

1428
01:19:02,751 --> 01:19:07,130
you lose bone mass. You, you most
certainly lose some muscle mass.

1429
01:19:07,131 --> 01:19:10,490
You definitely change physiologically
and become closer to a woman,

1430
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,710
but it's not a woman. And
people will say, well,

1431
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:14,690
what about a woman who's
just naturally strong?

1432
01:19:14,691 --> 01:19:17,810
What about like a Serena Williams,
like a super athlete woman? Okay,

1433
01:19:17,811 --> 01:19:19,430
that is who she is.

1434
01:19:19,550 --> 01:19:24,550
We're not talking about allowing
someone to go from the most vicious and

1435
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:26,480
powerful sex,

1436
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:31,510
the mail sacks and compete in a
violent sport against the softer sex.

1437
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:33,110
There's an aberration people.

1438
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,370
But what, but what year, just
to clear it up, you were saying,

1439
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,590
you were saying nothing about
the transgender community.

1440
01:19:38,591 --> 01:19:42,670
You were not saying that this particular
person should not be allowed to fight

1441
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:43,533
women fight

1442
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,980
women. That's it. Even if it's a race,
if it's a big game of basketball even we,

1443
01:19:47,981 --> 01:19:51,550
we joked around about it. There's
a 50 year old man, um, in um,

1444
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,060
California that's a,

1445
01:19:53,061 --> 01:19:57,900
a transgender and has joined this college
basketball team and is playing women's

1446
01:19:57,901 --> 01:20:02,490
college basketball as a six foot six,
220 pound man.

1447
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:06,990
He's enormous. That's insane. It is
insane. But I don't have a problem with,

1448
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:10,650
no one's getting hurt as
long as he doesn't start
like hard fouling or bullying

1449
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:13,320
people or something like that and using
his size and it seems like they all like

1450
01:20:13,321 --> 01:20:14,990
him.
I don't have a problem with it.

1451
01:20:14,991 --> 01:20:17,760
If it was my daughter and she got hurt
playing with him cause he knocked her

1452
01:20:17,761 --> 01:20:18,750
over, I might be like, hey man,

1453
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:22,170
that's kind of fucked up or
something along those lines.

1454
01:20:22,171 --> 01:20:27,171
But for the most part I think in
non contact sports it's probably,

1455
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:31,950
you know, I mean I think the Olympic
should probably have a standard,

1456
01:20:31,951 --> 01:20:34,580
I don't know what it is. If they've even
figured it out yet. I think they do.

1457
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,360
I think they do have it.
I think it's two years.

1458
01:20:36,361 --> 01:20:38,340
You have to have two years
of hormone replacement.

1459
01:20:38,341 --> 01:20:42,120
But I do not think that that should apply
to violent combat sports. I just don't,

1460
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:46,710
what if, if like Rhonda Rousey was like,
look, I want to fight this trigger.

1461
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,420
You know what,
which drainage or transgender women

1462
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:57,600
or I don't even know what I mean.
Yeah. That's his safe words. And I say,

1463
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,710
do you think,
do you think she should be out?

1464
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:08,790
Shit, shit should be, should
that be allowed though? Like
if Ron, Ron, first of all,

1465
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:13,760
Ronda Rousey is obviously,
if you're looking at the
spectrum of powerful female,

1466
01:21:13,761 --> 01:21:15,360
she's at the very top of the spectrum.

1467
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:19,080
She's a world champion woman's
cage fighter, you know,

1468
01:21:19,081 --> 01:21:22,560
she is a fucking legit certified Badass.

1469
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:27,860
So this guy that became a woman was never
as skilled as Ronda Rousey when he was

1470
01:21:29,881 --> 01:21:33,690
a man. And the, the strength and
the skill that Ronda Rousey has,

1471
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:36,880
I'm pretty sure she'd be
able to overcome some, uh,

1472
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:40,560
transgender average person.
But you know what,

1473
01:21:40,561 --> 01:21:44,490
if you found out that Ronda Rousey used
to be a man and that's why she was so

1474
01:21:44,491 --> 01:21:49,491
bad ass and flipping people around this
transgender has knocked three women

1475
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:55,130
brutally unconscious in cage fights that
did not know that she used to be a man

1476
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:59,310
and she's stopping them like
inside of 30 seconds. Okay,

1477
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:03,000
that I've watched the fight.
That is not the way a woman moves.

1478
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:04,230
That's the way a man moves.

1479
01:22:04,231 --> 01:22:07,050
I'm watching the way she's
beating up on these people.

1480
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,540
The mechanical advantage is still there.
If you look at her,

1481
01:22:09,541 --> 01:22:11,710
her fucking shoulders are wide.
Her.

1482
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:17,460
The deception is a part of it because
you should be able to say who you are.

1483
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:18,390
That's a thing.

1484
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:22,620
This is that there's a real problem in
the transgender community and in the

1485
01:22:22,621 --> 01:22:25,020
super progressive community
that supports transgenders.

1486
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:28,650
They don't believe you should even
have to disclose that used to be a

1487
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:31,900
transgender. When you attain
it, they don't think that
you should be able to just,

1488
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:33,450
you have to disclose it for work.

1489
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:35,940
They don't think you should have
to disclose it for competition.

1490
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,640
And I say bullshit
because it's not a woman.

1491
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:42,180
You're saying it's a woman because
they've changed into a woman and they're

1492
01:22:42,181 --> 01:22:43,740
injecting woman's hormones into it.

1493
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:48,380
But if you look at them chromosomally that
is an x, y chromosome. That's a man. If,

1494
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,030
if you talk to them individually,
they, for the most part,

1495
01:22:51,031 --> 01:22:54,810
they don't like my brother's gay and
knows a lot of transgenders who he calls

1496
01:22:54,811 --> 01:22:55,231
trainees,

1497
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:57,930
but I'm not allowed to say training
because I'm not gay because they know

1498
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:01,270
because it was, yeah, exactly. But it
suck a cock just so he could say, yeah,

1499
01:23:01,271 --> 01:23:05,430
I should unclos talking brothers
Cock and then you're done. Listen,

1500
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,470
to be honest with you.
Exactly. How do you know?

1501
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:10,390
You don't know my or my mouth has been,

1502
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:15,070
but like every transgender who
I've met through my brother,

1503
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:18,460
totally cool. They always joke about
they, they say trainee, you know,

1504
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:22,120
they say like, ah, it used
to be, it's a joke, right?

1505
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,760
I guarantee you all these people I'm
talking about wouldn't give a shit about

1506
01:23:24,761 --> 01:23:27,730
what you're saying is a lot of the people
that are getting super upset or not

1507
01:23:27,731 --> 01:23:31,530
even transgenders, that that's what I'm
saying. We're more more of those angers.

1508
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,100
I don't think the anger is
coming from Huc community.

1509
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:36,490
There's this weird left wing
anger thing going on. You know?

1510
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:41,230
That is where people think that if you're
not progressive and you disagree with

1511
01:23:41,231 --> 01:23:41,891
them in some way,

1512
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:45,760
that it's cool to call you an asshole
or a caveman or a piece of shit or

1513
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:48,640
whatever, and I haven't taken
a lot of this on Twitter.

1514
01:23:48,641 --> 01:23:52,570
It's hilarious from people where I
have been nothing but supportive of

1515
01:23:52,571 --> 01:23:56,500
everything except of man who
used to be a man fighting women.

1516
01:23:56,501 --> 01:23:58,330
That's what I'm supporting you.
That's you.

1517
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:03,360
Because you went out of your way to just
say this specific person and you ain't,

1518
01:24:03,511 --> 01:24:06,580
she even called her a woman.
Yeah. Well she's not a woman,

1519
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:09,640
but if she wants to be a woman, I'm
cool with that. If you want to be a her,

1520
01:24:09,641 --> 01:24:11,920
that's cool.
You are a transgender.

1521
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:16,720
That's what you are and
you're a transgender woman
and I am totally okay with

1522
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:20,110
whatever you want to do for a living,
whatever you want to call yourself.

1523
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:21,220
I'm okay with all of that.

1524
01:24:21,221 --> 01:24:25,180
As long as you can't beat up women because
I really don't think that it's fair.

1525
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:28,330
So why wouldn't women's groups come
to your aid and say we don't want,

1526
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,880
I think this is a relatively new issue.
First of all,

1527
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,160
this is a relatively new issue,
but Misha Tate,

1528
01:24:33,161 --> 01:24:37,120
who's a high level women's MMA fighter
has already said she's going to be the

1529
01:24:37,121 --> 01:24:39,040
coaches on the next ultimate fighter.

1530
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:41,880
She just said she would never fight
this check. And she just said, you know,

1531
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:42,610
she wants to,

1532
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:47,530
she would need to hear more about genetics
and test or a body composition and

1533
01:24:47,531 --> 01:24:49,710
testing. I have, you know,
like on that same token,

1534
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:53,320
like I have gay friends who like hate,
glad, they're like, they're just taking,

1535
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:55,950
they're put in to making us sound
like we're proved and stuck.

1536
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:59,500
I think they just take it too
far. So like, it's like, you know,

1537
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:01,430
just everyone needs to
come to, well this, this,

1538
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,710
there's this thing in the progressive
community where they're really aggressive

1539
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:09,760
and shitty with people that has an
opposing opinion and they like immediate,

1540
01:25:09,761 --> 01:25:14,030
like one of the, like I've had
disagreements with people, uh,

1541
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:18,820
about rules and regulations regarding
cage fighting about decisions for cage

1542
01:25:18,821 --> 01:25:23,821
fights and have many more people be way
more polite about their disagreements or

1543
01:25:23,891 --> 01:25:27,550
I felt that he won because of this
reason. But Hey, thanks for the, uh,

1544
01:25:27,551 --> 01:25:31,180
the forum to discuss this are people
pretty fucking cool and rational,

1545
01:25:31,181 --> 01:25:32,620
but it comes cage fighting fans.

1546
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:37,240
But people that are upset with me that
disagree with me about this trainee thing

1547
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:41,110
universally have been
insulting almost universally.

1548
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:44,470
And I looked at how many tweets you
think you've gotten about it? Hundreds.

1549
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:48,420
Hundreds. Just, I don't know. No, no,
no. Put it away. I don't even care.

1550
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:52,340
But if this has been less than
how long? Um, I dunno. Well, we,

1551
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:55,740
the David Lee Roth thing was last
week, but less than a week. Yeah. Well,

1552
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:57,820
whatever it is. Um, it's,

1553
01:25:58,270 --> 01:26:03,270
it's interesting that so many people who
consider themselves sensitive left wing

1554
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:09,230
are also like really quick to
insult you for no fucking reason.

1555
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,240
Like really quick.
Even if you,

1556
01:26:11,241 --> 01:26:14,450
and even when I've responded
to them without insults,

1557
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:16,250
you get more back,

1558
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:20,150
asshole shit had Dick Wad just
over and over and over again.

1559
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:23,060
You fucking insensitive
pig. You know, like,

1560
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:24,830
like I'm an honorary.

1561
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:28,380
I'd be the first to tell you if I thought
you were being insensitive or if like

1562
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:32,540
if you were saying shit about, you
know, certain know I would say,

1563
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:34,190
I would say I wouldn't
bullshit you if you,

1564
01:26:34,191 --> 01:26:37,350
if I thought you were making fun of gay
people or transgenders or whatever it is,

1565
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:39,780
but that was not what you were doing.
That's what I'm sticking up for you.

1566
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:41,540
Well thank you.
But that's sort of my point.

1567
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:45,380
My point is that there's a bunch of
people in this society that aren't really

1568
01:26:45,381 --> 01:26:46,214
outraged.

1569
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:49,730
What they're doing is choosing to be
outraged and they're outraged about a lot

1570
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:52,010
of shit. They're outraged about
the state of their own life.

1571
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:54,970
They're outraged about the progress
they have in their career, their,

1572
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,520
their romance there, whatever the
fuck it is, their weight loss program,

1573
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:03,260
they're outraged about a lot of shit and
when something comes along where they

1574
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:05,870
have the green light to
be upset about things,

1575
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:10,700
then they feel like it's
on Twitter waiting to get
upset and they feel like it's

1576
01:27:10,701 --> 01:27:15,110
cool to like lash out. It's
cool. It's cool to like let,

1577
01:27:15,111 --> 01:27:19,130
I'm taking a stand,
fuck this and fuck that and fuck you.

1578
01:27:19,131 --> 01:27:20,300
And whoa.

1579
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:25,330
Like we're just talking about a guy who
gets an operation and now is allowed to

1580
01:27:25,941 --> 01:27:27,410
beat the fuck out of girls.

1581
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:31,790
And I'm just saying that I know a lot
about beating the fuck out of people.

1582
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:34,550
I'm a professional cage
fighting commentary.

1583
01:27:34,551 --> 01:27:38,840
I've been involved in martial arts my
entire life and I know a lot of trainees

1584
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:42,800
and I know trainees that look like girls.
I met a trainee once,

1585
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:45,950
she was tiny,
she weighed like a hundred pounds and you,

1586
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,910
you would never know that this was a,
this was a girl or it wasn't a girl.

1587
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:52,880
This was born a guy and I made
that mistake a couple of times.

1588
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:55,220
I've had it happen a bunch of times.
We had one on the man show,

1589
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:59,810
she called herself vanity and
she was a beautiful man. Really,

1590
01:27:59,811 --> 01:28:00,740
really pretty.

1591
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:05,690
And she also had a dick that looked
like a plays and monkey cock.

1592
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:09,650
It was like black and it was like she
was slowly poisoning it by feeding an

1593
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:13,580
estrogen tastes the same. I don't know.
I didn't even, I was drunk at the time.

1594
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,380
The um, this woman, what we had,
we did, we had this show called,

1595
01:28:18,381 --> 01:28:20,480
this is one of the things about
working for comedy central.

1596
01:28:20,481 --> 01:28:23,180
I'm sure your experience is probably
more positive than ours because we were

1597
01:28:23,181 --> 01:28:26,760
coming in sort of to a preexisting show.
Yeah.

1598
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:29,360
And they had a lot of ideas about
what it shouldn't, shouldn't be.

1599
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:33,240
One of the things was we had a show
called make previous regime. Yeah.

1600
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:37,680
Those fucks, they're done.
They're done yet dead. The, um,

1601
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:42,050
we had a show called make me hard
and make me hard was we would put a,

1602
01:28:42,051 --> 01:28:45,140
like a box onto your cock
that was supposed to like
recognize when you've got a

1603
01:28:45,141 --> 01:28:48,620
boner and there was a light bulb on it
and light bulb would flash red whenever

1604
01:28:48,621 --> 01:28:51,830
your dick out heart. So we would have
things like major seat and bananas.

1605
01:28:51,831 --> 01:28:55,190
Of course you dick would get hard
and just really ridiculous shit.

1606
01:28:55,370 --> 01:29:00,230
So we had this woman who was, yeah, she
was in a bikini and I'm telling you,

1607
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:01,980
there's no way you would not know that

1608
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,920
she was born a man.
She hot as fuck.

1609
01:29:04,921 --> 01:29:06,630
If you were stuck on a
deserted island with her,

1610
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:09,710
you wouldn't even care that much as
long as she kept her pants. Dot. Yeah,

1611
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:12,870
she's preop. Okay. So she's, uh,

1612
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:16,920
she's on top of this guy and she's pouring
whipped cream all over her enhanced

1613
01:29:16,921 --> 01:29:21,860
breasts, which looked amazing. Um, the
guys suck in the whip cream off of her,

1614
01:29:21,861 --> 01:29:24,570
her breasts.
Everyone's going fucking crazy.

1615
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:29,810
Then she pulls her fake or pulls
her pants down to reveal her poison.

1616
01:29:31,141 --> 01:29:36,030
Dick is withered. Bonobo. Monkey. Dick
looks like mine. And of course then the,

1617
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:37,890
the light starts flashing like crazy.

1618
01:29:37,891 --> 01:29:42,060
The guy's Dick a hard as a rock and the
audience let out the one of the most

1619
01:29:42,061 --> 01:29:46,410
tangible moans I've ever heard,
like one of the most like visceral,

1620
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:50,800
like down to your DNA, Moen. It was like
as soon as the, the, the cock came out,

1621
01:29:50,801 --> 01:29:51,890
I was like,
oh.

1622
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:57,330
It was just like thinking about the fact
that this guy just been sucking on this

1623
01:29:57,331 --> 01:30:01,290
girl's tits, whipping know
whip cream, sucking lip cream.

1624
01:30:01,291 --> 01:30:04,740
I for tents like seconds ago, all
the way. By the way, he's tied up.

1625
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,590
He can't move his boxes on his cock.

1626
01:30:08,210 --> 01:30:12,860
It's crazy. It's crazy. Cause I might, my
show, they have to, is it up there? No,

1627
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:14,340
we're not talking to you that they,
they,

1628
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:18,530
we did audience testing of our show and
one of the first bits I did on my show

1629
01:30:18,531 --> 01:30:22,560
was my buddy Brian, who's gay. I get you.

1630
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:25,790
You're not as bad as other Brian's in
the world. You fuck. Yeah, exactly.

1631
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:30,260
You're my buddy now. But he was
my buddy still. He, uh, he's gay.

1632
01:30:30,261 --> 01:30:34,530
So we this, that APP Grindr where you meet
guys, uh, you know the APP. Grindr. Yeah.

1633
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,970
So I get on Grindr. I tried to get
him late through the APP. Right.

1634
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:39,680
So we send that the show,
the audience test.

1635
01:30:39,681 --> 01:30:41,190
This is what I heard cause
I'd never saw the results.

1636
01:30:41,191 --> 01:30:45,110
It's like once the audience
saw that scene, they were done.

1637
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,480
Like they will not watch this show.
Like they just,

1638
01:30:47,481 --> 01:30:49,610
they thought the whole show was like,

1639
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:53,870
it almost made me not go to air because
the lights just like this is a gay show

1640
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:58,940
in that crazy to think that like, like
they couldn't, what happened? What I,

1641
01:30:58,941 --> 01:31:02,240
what I heard was that the, you know,
people stopped, you know, they,

1642
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:04,910
they move the meters and I'll let shit,
people just tune like they're done.

1643
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,400
Like there was funny stuff after I
thought that piece is really funny,

1644
01:31:07,401 --> 01:31:10,730
which is actually airing.
Wow. It's going to air. It is.

1645
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:14,270
So I give him credit for airing it, but
they just stay too. They're just like,

1646
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:17,990
this is gay and I don't want the
testing people to think I'm gay,

1647
01:31:17,991 --> 01:31:22,520
so I'm not going to say I liked this show.
It's not even, it wasn't even, you know,

1648
01:31:22,521 --> 01:31:22,870
just

1649
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:24,880
me trying to get my buddy let you,
first of all,

1650
01:31:24,881 --> 01:31:26,710
you have to think who's testing the show.

1651
01:31:26,711 --> 01:31:29,890
Those are the people that don't have
jobs that they pay to sit down and watch

1652
01:31:29,891 --> 01:31:31,690
these things.
And a lot of those people are crazy.

1653
01:31:31,691 --> 01:31:34,420
I give credit to the network
for ignoring that data. Yeah.

1654
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,280
That just cool of them to say,
listen,

1655
01:31:36,281 --> 01:31:38,980
these guys didn't like the
show cause they thought it was,

1656
01:31:38,981 --> 01:31:40,490
there's a gay scenes of buckets.

1657
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:44,920
I think one of the things that we've
learned is that there's only one way for a

1658
01:31:44,921 --> 01:31:47,290
unique vision to get on to television,

1659
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:51,070
whether it's or in any form,
whether it's a movie or,

1660
01:31:51,071 --> 01:31:54,070
I mean it's gotta be this one
person's idea. Ben Hoffman,

1661
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:58,170
what do you think is funny? Go with
it. And if you're good and if you,

1662
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,350
you understand boundaries

1663
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:04,580
and if you understand how to display
something that might be controversial and

1664
01:32:04,581 --> 01:32:06,860
allow people to sort of see
where you're coming from,

1665
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:10,730
they'll accept it or enough people
will accept it and then also they'll

1666
01:32:10,731 --> 01:32:13,430
gravitate towards it. They'll go, hey,
this Ben Hoffman, this guy's for real,

1667
01:32:13,431 --> 01:32:14,264
his shows.

1668
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,350
I appreciate that.
That was the whole vision of the show,

1669
01:32:17,351 --> 01:32:20,260
which is people always ask me like,
how'd you get this show on the,

1670
01:32:20,261 --> 01:32:22,480
it's crazy you got this fucking
thing on the or how would you do it?

1671
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:26,290
And I'm not making this up when I
say this, the goal of the pilot,

1672
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:29,290
because I was getting a lot of starting
to get more writing gigs and I wanted to

1673
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:31,840
get better, right. And Gates, so I
decided I'm going to make a pilot.

1674
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:36,220
That's just to get me better. Right. I'm
saying this to be completely honesty.

1675
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:39,850
I don't want the show to get picked
up. That was my mode of thinking. I go,

1676
01:32:39,851 --> 01:32:43,930
I want to make the most of the craziest
pilot ever that people will see in the

1677
01:32:43,931 --> 01:32:47,560
industry and say, who the fuck is it?
I gotta meet this guy, we can't air,

1678
01:32:47,561 --> 01:32:50,170
this is unairable.
But I got that note at one point.

1679
01:32:50,171 --> 01:32:53,860
This is an Arab oil and it was, it was,
it was not like, it was not for air,

1680
01:32:53,861 --> 01:32:56,800
just going to be totally me. So instead
of having to send writing samples,

1681
01:32:57,070 --> 01:32:59,950
I could send this comedy central pilot
out to people and then he'd make me seem

1682
01:32:59,951 --> 01:33:03,760
more legit than I get a call. Like, Oh
shit man, you're not gonna believe this.

1683
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:06,490
They fucking love the Bible is
that they need, which is great.

1684
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:08,980
But at the time it was
not even a goal of mine,

1685
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:11,890
which is almost the best way to do it,
which is I'm just,

1686
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:16,300
I'm not going to listen to fucking
anything there. I, you know,

1687
01:33:16,301 --> 01:33:17,350
can't as it got,
you know,

1688
01:33:17,351 --> 01:33:20,320
guy running things over there and
he's really into an individual voices,

1689
01:33:20,321 --> 01:33:23,050
which is, I'm hoping that's
why I'm hoping the show were.

1690
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:27,320
And there's a lot of that stuff going on
over there. And I again, I Kent Alterman,

1691
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:30,690
he's been fucking great.
He's like, do your thing.

1692
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:35,620
He gives me notes that make the show
and I'm not saying this cause that's,

1693
01:33:35,621 --> 01:33:36,850
cause he's not little,
he's probably not listening,

1694
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,400
although hopefully someone
will give this to him. Um,

1695
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:43,030
he's given me notes that makes
the show more me, you know,

1696
01:33:43,031 --> 01:33:46,280
so he's going through the thing. So
it's, it's, I was, I'm really in a,

1697
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:49,450
I'm hoping people watch the show
obviously, so I can keep doing it,

1698
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:52,510
but I'm really in a rare place
where I can do the exact,

1699
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:54,970
there is nothing I've done on
the show they don't want to do.

1700
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:57,280
That's perfect. That's the
only way to do a show, right.

1701
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:59,670
Wants to get you think you're talented

1702
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:01,090
and then support you.
The problem.

1703
01:34:01,091 --> 01:34:05,060
The only downside is when like these
Twitter things and that it's extra per,

1704
01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:09,370
it's I gotta I have to ignore it of
course. But they really are insulting you.

1705
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:12,310
Like if you've gone when you go on stage
and do your standup and they had people

1706
01:34:12,311 --> 01:34:15,640
don't like it. It's harder for different
than you because people are coming in,

1707
01:34:15,641 --> 01:34:17,200
they're paying Mital cause
they liked your show.

1708
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:21,040
But if you put yourself out there like
on your like standup specials you've done

1709
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:24,940
and people don't like it, they are
insulting you as a person. It's like when,

1710
01:34:24,941 --> 01:34:29,410
if they insult my show, they're insulting
me. Like my, my actual dad's on the show,

1711
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,120
you know. But that's good. I love it.

1712
01:34:31,121 --> 01:34:32,800
I mean it took me a couple
of weeks to get used to it.

1713
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:36,580
I'm not going to lie to read that Shit
and get used to personal cause it,

1714
01:34:36,581 --> 01:34:39,940
all this stuff I'd done was like,
I was part of a show or writing on a show,

1715
01:34:39,941 --> 01:34:42,190
producing show being having
a small part in a show.

1716
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:46,570
So to have my name in the show and have
you don't think about the time cause

1717
01:34:46,571 --> 01:34:49,590
there's no live studio audience,
but to do a show, you know,

1718
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,950
kind of with my friends and kind of on my
own, do my own, put myself up, you know,

1719
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:59,120
you know, out there for everyone to see
without again, without a live audience,

1720
01:34:59,121 --> 01:35:02,330
you just don't know. And
then it like month, a couple
months later dare. It's like,

1721
01:35:02,331 --> 01:35:04,670
wait a second,
I really fucking put myself out there

1722
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:07,090
to do that though.
Because that's the honest reaction.

1723
01:35:07,091 --> 01:35:09,690
That's the people that aren't paid and
some of them are going to be assholes,

1724
01:35:09,691 --> 01:35:10,511
they're going to hate everything.

1725
01:35:10,511 --> 01:35:12,590
But the other ones have good
points and then be better.

1726
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:13,670
Exactly.
And also,

1727
01:35:13,671 --> 01:35:18,500
but if if let's say a 60% of the
people like it, that's still,

1728
01:35:18,501 --> 01:35:21,740
it's plenty audience. Oh yeah. It's
more than enough. He's more than plenty.

1729
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:25,540
40% hate it. You can't make
everybody happy. Exactly. What I've,

1730
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:26,600
I've learned that at the heart,
right?

1731
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:30,040
There's music that I love that I've
talked about on this, on the podcast,

1732
01:35:30,041 --> 01:35:34,600
and I'll get people fucking hate
tweeting me that fucking pussy shit.

1733
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:37,060
One of my favorite bands,

1734
01:35:37,061 --> 01:35:39,160
honey honey that we've had on
the podcast a bunch of times,

1735
01:35:39,161 --> 01:35:40,210
every time we have them on,

1736
01:35:40,211 --> 01:35:44,350
I get a fucking hundred on the tween
from a punch of people out there.

1737
01:35:44,351 --> 01:35:45,370
They're just miserable.

1738
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:47,600
And the crazy thing is these
are people who listen to you,

1739
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:50,640
who just listened to your show
and they want to just get,

1740
01:35:50,930 --> 01:35:55,250
so their fans insulting one particular,
there's always gonna be that.

1741
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:56,450
And especially because the

1742
01:35:56,530 --> 01:36:00,130
anonymity of the Internet and the fact
that they can just interact with you

1743
01:36:00,131 --> 01:36:02,280
through text on the screen.
This,

1744
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:06,200
there's very little like reason to
be kind. There's very little to,

1745
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:10,580
it's weird. I saw one of your tweets the
other day and it stuck with me. I was,

1746
01:36:10,581 --> 01:36:14,570
cause I was reading like, you know, I
got a separate in this shit I think.

1747
01:36:14,571 --> 01:36:18,050
Although it's sometimes fun to read
even insult, but your, what'd you say?

1748
01:36:18,051 --> 01:36:22,310
You saw Oz, the wizard of
Oz, the new eyes, blue eyes.

1749
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,970
And you're like got bad reviews.
Just a reminder that uh,

1750
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:28,730
most critics are said cons.
Isn't that weird?

1751
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:32,090
You said something like that.
It just reinforced my notion,

1752
01:36:32,091 --> 01:36:35,300
my belief that most critics are sad.
That makes me feel bad.

1753
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:37,880
Like that tweet calm me down
for about 30 to 35 seconds.

1754
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:43,330
The reality is most people are critics
who are critics because they don't have

1755
01:36:43,431 --> 01:36:46,520
anything to contribute. They're not
artists. They wanted to be artists.

1756
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:49,790
Almost every critic wanted
to be something artistic,

1757
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:53,810
whether it's a writer or whether it's
they want to do screenplays are novels and

1758
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:57,770
in fact some of them have and failed.
They're not the right people for the job.

1759
01:36:57,950 --> 01:37:00,760
The only right people for the
job or regular people. Not yet.

1760
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:02,930
We get paid well and don't get me wrong,

1761
01:37:02,931 --> 01:37:06,230
I wasn't making like when an Asian woman
crosses a street and you hear me see me

1762
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:09,740
hit a gong, like I wasn't
going. This is critics gold man.

1763
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:12,340
This is like when people are
going to be funny. All I'm,

1764
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:14,540
the whole point of show is just calming.
It's all it is.

1765
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:20,060
W we do that in stand up and we do that.
And you know, on a podcast you don't,

1766
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:22,790
you're not always saying things because
it's supposed to be the most brilliant

1767
01:37:22,791 --> 01:37:25,580
thing ever. He just, you know
what the funny thing to say is,

1768
01:37:25,581 --> 01:37:26,690
you know what the funny thing to do is?

1769
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:29,170
Yeah. I mean this is, I
like these kind of like von,

1770
01:37:29,190 --> 01:37:31,870
these kinds of podcasts where I don't
have to be funny all the time. Again, I'm,

1771
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:35,370
I'm, I'm not going to dead if
that's the case. But you know,

1772
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:38,310
like when you have time, you want to make
a show, you just want it to be funny.

1773
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:40,920
You're not thinking about like,
well, this reached the artistic,

1774
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:42,070
it's just like fucking be fun

1775
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:44,310
playing to the back of the room like that.
A super dangerous,

1776
01:37:44,311 --> 01:37:47,970
that's like some UCB shit where you
see comics that will survive there,

1777
01:37:47,971 --> 01:37:50,220
but they go anywhere else and
they eat a fat, played a decks.

1778
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:55,020
The reason why is because you're
trying to be this like, you know,

1779
01:37:55,350 --> 01:38:00,330
really eccentric playing to the
back of the room inside joke,

1780
01:38:00,331 --> 01:38:02,700
you know, very verbose,
you know, very articulate.

1781
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:05,150
You're trying to appeal to the critics.
You're trying,

1782
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:09,930
well, I think I've noticed that recently
to meet the death of comedy is cool.

1783
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:12,030
Yeah.
People trying to be cool.

1784
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:15,180
It's killing comic and that's just
so much of that shit nowadays.

1785
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:17,840
It's like those cool indie bands,
you know, these cool indie car.

1786
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:20,970
There's just so much
coolness trying to be cool.

1787
01:38:21,150 --> 01:38:24,690
There are certain people that are just
cool and it's just who they are. Like,

1788
01:38:24,691 --> 01:38:28,080
you know, Chris Rock is cool, right? What
are you going to do about it? Exactly.

1789
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:32,820
But he Chappelle's cool. He's a cool
guy, but he knows how to bring con.

1790
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:36,270
I'm not saying you can't be cool. I'm
just saying can try to be cool. That's,

1791
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:37,200
that's what the,
the,

1792
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:41,670
these people are worried about making
an ass out of themselves. Right.

1793
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:44,300
They're getting in the way of their
comedy by trying to be cool. Well,

1794
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:47,490
there's that thing too
where they show some cool

1795
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:50,920
does that thing too where they criticized
physical comedy and they criticize

1796
01:38:50,921 --> 01:38:54,550
anybody who tries too hard or they
criticize anybody who's animated on stage.

1797
01:38:54,551 --> 01:38:58,000
Like, oh, he's one of those comics.
And you're like, what an entertainer.

1798
01:38:58,050 --> 01:38:58,883
But someone's actually,
yeah,

1799
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:02,520
I was watching Jim Carrey
on this interview the other
day and he was this inside

1800
01:39:02,521 --> 01:39:04,140
comedy show on showtime
is actually pretty good.

1801
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:07,640
And he was talking about how like
ace Ventura came out and like have,

1802
01:39:07,730 --> 01:39:11,040
obviously it's not the critics. Critics
don't go, hey, go see ace Ventura.

1803
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:11,491
But he gets,

1804
01:39:11,491 --> 01:39:15,060
he got calls from Steve Martin and all
his favorite comics were coming up to him

1805
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,390
and telling him like other comics were
saying, God, this movie is brilliant.

1806
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,940
And he was like, I can, who gives
a fuck about what that critic,

1807
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:22,680
you know Steve Martin
called me on my phone.

1808
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,500
Like my favorite comedian
called me and said, he called,

1809
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:28,140
you know what he's saying?
You have to talk. I was,

1810
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:32,570
I'm carrying Jim Carrey right now.
Jesus Christ. Brian, no cheap.

1811
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:35,270
Martin didn't call me, but it would
be called people tuned in. Right?

1812
01:39:35,290 --> 01:39:39,780
You just woke up. See Martin called
you. Who are you? That's what happens.

1813
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,150
You fucking playing solitaire over there.
You're following whatever.

1814
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:45,060
But now I take it personally.
Maybe I'm being so fucking boring.

1815
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:49,430
Listen man, you're not going
to your art, whatever it is,

1816
01:39:49,431 --> 01:39:52,970
whether it's a TV show or a stand up
comedy act, it's a work in progress.

1817
01:39:52,971 --> 01:39:53,361
It's always,

1818
01:39:53,361 --> 01:39:55,790
you're always improving it and you're
constantly getting better and part of the

1819
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:59,750
input is criticism,
whether it's a positive or negative,

1820
01:39:59,751 --> 01:40:00,800
the input of the audience,

1821
01:40:00,801 --> 01:40:03,320
whether it's laughter or people
sending you a text message.

1822
01:40:03,321 --> 01:40:05,480
Just saying racism hurts
you the most though.

1823
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:08,030
Is there any that hurts you at this
point or no? It shouldn't hurt you.

1824
01:40:08,031 --> 01:40:12,920
If it hurts me, I'm telling you
what hurts me is when they're right.

1825
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,690
That's what hurts me. Yeah. If I,

1826
01:40:14,691 --> 01:40:18,470
if I did something where I knew it was
lazy or I did something where it half

1827
01:40:18,471 --> 01:40:22,170
assed it, if you tell me something sucked
and I'm like, okay, you say it. Sorry,

1828
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:26,750
I just heard a thousand people laugh
their asses off and they enjoyed it and I

1829
01:40:26,751 --> 01:40:29,390
liked that kind of comedy. The
okay, that's how fine. You know,

1830
01:40:29,391 --> 01:40:32,690
you could say it sucks. This is not
your style. I know what I'm doing.

1831
01:40:32,691 --> 01:40:35,400
I know my style, I know
what I enjoyed doing. What?

1832
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:38,960
What would bother me and what has in
the past is when someone would say

1833
01:40:38,961 --> 01:40:40,960
something and I knew that they were right.
You know,

1834
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:44,650
I hadn't been working hard enough at
something or it was lazy or the bit was,

1835
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:47,930
you know, it was a cheap ending to the
bid or whatever, something like that. So,

1836
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:50,210
but those have been super
important over the years.

1837
01:40:50,230 --> 01:40:54,490
Like that negative criticism oftentimes
helps you more than anything.

1838
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:55,301
That's interesting.

1839
01:40:55,301 --> 01:40:58,210
I never thought about it like that
because that I'll bet there are some that

1840
01:40:58,211 --> 01:41:02,130
really stung and got me really pissed
because they were probably going to stand

1841
01:41:02,131 --> 01:41:03,230
up. Do you do, I don't do standup.

1842
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:05,780
Okay. That's the thing you see
when you're doing stand up,

1843
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:08,630
you're constantly getting
reactions from the crowd.

1844
01:41:08,631 --> 01:41:10,400
You're constantly getting in plenty.
I did a lot of,

1845
01:41:10,430 --> 01:41:12,650
you know I did sketch all
the time so I was, you know,

1846
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:16,190
I've been in front of those non laughing
audiences. So that's just an important,

1847
01:41:16,191 --> 01:41:19,010
similar, the difference being of
course, that when you're standing up,

1848
01:41:19,011 --> 01:41:23,690
you're completely on your own up there
and you've got nothing to talk about

1849
01:41:23,691 --> 01:41:27,470
other than what's inside your head
and trying to relay these ideas to the

1850
01:41:27,471 --> 01:41:30,080
audience. And some people can
do it and some people can't.

1851
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:33,340
Some people can do it some days and
can't do it the other days and wouldn't,

1852
01:41:33,341 --> 01:41:34,280
especially when you start out,

1853
01:41:34,281 --> 01:41:37,990
there's a long process from the time
you first started out to the time when

1854
01:41:37,991 --> 01:41:40,460
you're like a legit
headline or a 10 years plus.

1855
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:44,150
And along the way you have
to bomb you literally,

1856
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:47,630
there's no way to do it right.
Every time you're going to fuck up,

1857
01:41:47,631 --> 01:41:48,710
you're going to be insecure.

1858
01:41:48,890 --> 01:41:51,230
You're going to get in a fight with your
girlfriend and you're going to fucking

1859
01:41:51,231 --> 01:41:53,300
have a bill that you have
to pay that's on your mind.

1860
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:56,900
He's going to be a lot of shit and you're
going to have to learn how to navigate

1861
01:41:56,901 --> 01:41:59,600
and negotiate every one of
those particular situations.

1862
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:02,690
Yeah, I mean that's kind of why I didn't
get into state and I just, cause I just,

1863
01:42:02,930 --> 01:42:05,420
I just knew, first of all, I didn't
want, it's not what I wanted to do.

1864
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:06,530
I knew I wanted to do TV,

1865
01:42:06,531 --> 01:42:10,310
so I didn't want to be one of those
guys who did stand up to try to get

1866
01:42:10,311 --> 01:42:15,180
something else out of it. But like
I just knew I wouldn't be good at,

1867
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:17,900
you know, it wasn't my thing.
So that's why he started.

1868
01:42:17,901 --> 01:42:20,690
You don't do it in the writing and all
that. I wanted to work my way into TV,

1869
01:42:20,691 --> 01:42:23,780
although my, my TV is kind of,
you know, that's my standup,

1870
01:42:23,781 --> 01:42:25,520
which is me putting myself out there.

1871
01:42:25,670 --> 01:42:28,510
Well there's a lot of people that have
become like sort of Internet stand,

1872
01:42:28,730 --> 01:42:31,840
you know, like they do like youtube
videos and shit and they like,

1873
01:42:31,841 --> 01:42:34,100
they'll have like a million hits
on them and you'll find it and,

1874
01:42:34,350 --> 01:42:37,640
and they're just a funny guy who's got
to take on something going to the movies

1875
01:42:37,641 --> 01:42:38,391
or this or that.

1876
01:42:38,391 --> 01:42:43,280
And I think you don't need to only do
it live in front of an audience with a

1877
01:42:43,281 --> 01:42:47,900
microphone. It's just, that's what
I like. That's my, I enjoy it.

1878
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:52,930
But I could totally see a
bunch of different outlets
for kind of the same thing.

1879
01:42:53,451 --> 01:42:56,960
It's like what is, what is your
point of view? What is your or your,

1880
01:42:57,140 --> 01:43:00,830
your way to create a product,
whether it's a video or an audio clip,

1881
01:43:00,831 --> 01:43:02,210
whatever it is that you think is good.

1882
01:43:02,810 --> 01:43:05,830
I just, I, when I, when people ask
me to do live stuff, I just do it.

1883
01:43:05,831 --> 01:43:07,690
This one bit that I have
from my show life and that's,

1884
01:43:07,691 --> 01:43:08,860
I went until standup Saturday.

1885
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:14,110
Like I forgot how fun it is to watch
like funny standup. It's fucking great.

1886
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:17,200
I just go very rarely.
I mean my favorite, uh,

1887
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:21,250
I don't know that I've ever laughed
harder than watching norm macdonald do

1888
01:43:21,330 --> 01:43:23,170
standup. He's, he's, he's,

1889
01:43:23,710 --> 01:43:26,380
he's my favorite standup to
watch prior to finally guy,

1890
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:30,120
awesome guys and new podcast to
with Adam from Tempe Improv. Oh,

1891
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:32,740
it doesn't really? Yeah. Oh, that's
great man. He wants to come on the show.

1892
01:43:32,741 --> 01:43:36,640
I think he's on the bench.
Oh, by the way. Um, and uh,

1893
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:38,710
but just watching,

1894
01:43:38,711 --> 01:43:41,530
just knowing I can't do or let go as
a kid watching Richard Pryor movies,

1895
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:44,770
like I can never fucking do that.
You could do that. Yeah. That's

1896
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:47,340
not true. It's just a
matter of time, you know?

1897
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:50,590
But I asked Richard Pryor wasn't good
when he started out either. I, nobody was,

1898
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:52,130
you start out and you

1899
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:55,640
still figure it out. Yeah. You
know, it's like anything else.

1900
01:43:55,790 --> 01:44:00,080
Like what do you choose? I'm
happy where I am, so don't,

1901
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,360
I don't want people to think
like I'm bitching and moaning.

1902
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:06,500
I don't think anybody does.
Well, I kind of do. Do you? Yeah.

1903
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:10,190
The thing about you receiving
feedback though from the audience,

1904
01:44:10,191 --> 01:44:14,810
it's just you don't, you're not getting
that feedback every weekend in a club,

1905
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:16,550
you know?
So when you're doing it,

1906
01:44:16,551 --> 01:44:18,230
you're putting together
your editing it and boom,

1907
01:44:18,231 --> 01:44:19,820
throwing it out there and
then you get the feedback.

1908
01:44:19,821 --> 01:44:23,690
So it's more of a slow reaction
to the work you're getting any,

1909
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:24,770
but you get it all at once.

1910
01:44:24,771 --> 01:44:28,550
You get that night and then it kind of
slows down and every Thursday night I get,

1911
01:44:28,810 --> 01:44:31,580
we need all saw a new guy to
the new guy thing. It's like,

1912
01:44:31,581 --> 01:44:34,160
who's this fucking new guy? Yeah.
And I've noticed that over the,

1913
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:38,030
even over three weeks I've watched it
dissipate, which is very good sign for me.

1914
01:44:38,031 --> 01:44:41,180
I've watched it like the haters leave.
They don't watch every week.

1915
01:44:41,181 --> 01:44:41,750
They were just like,

1916
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:44,810
you interrupted my fucking favorite
show with your dumb shit. I hate you.

1917
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:47,960
They go laid and the new then the
people who like it sticker. I just,

1918
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:52,040
even even me, it's hard for me to get used
to a new show, you know, in a new guy.

1919
01:44:52,041 --> 01:44:57,020
It's hard. Yeah. It's um, it's, it's
really hard to get into new shows.

1920
01:44:57,021 --> 01:44:57,930
There's not that there's,

1921
01:44:58,010 --> 01:45:01,030
there's a better selection
of shows to watch now though,

1922
01:45:01,031 --> 01:45:02,570
that I think I've ever been before.

1923
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:05,800
And also is that there's a new show
after mine called Nathan for you starting

1924
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:08,570
Nathan fielder, which is another
really funny show. Same kind of thing.

1925
01:45:08,571 --> 01:45:13,070
He's just being himself and uh,
we're both kind of in the same boat,

1926
01:45:13,071 --> 01:45:17,090
which is a new night, you know, new faces,
new comedian. What's it called? Nathan.

1927
01:45:17,091 --> 01:45:20,560
Nathan for you. It's really
funny you for you. He takes,

1928
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:24,530
he takes on to small businesses and gives
them business advice that he kind of

1929
01:45:24,531 --> 01:45:29,060
doesn't know what he's doing. It's really,
yeah, you should, we should watch it.

1930
01:45:29,061 --> 01:45:32,660
It's really good. So his name is, last
name is Nathan fielder fielder. Yeah.

1931
01:45:32,661 --> 01:45:37,100
So me and him have are,
are, you know, I'm at 10,

1932
01:45:37,101 --> 01:45:38,240
he's a 10 30 Thursday.

1933
01:45:38,241 --> 01:45:41,780
So it's Kinda this new night of comedy
for comedy central have to unknown guys.

1934
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:44,610
So it's a slow build but
they're bringing back the cause.

1935
01:45:45,670 --> 01:45:48,230
I think that it's so
important to have new faces.

1936
01:45:48,231 --> 01:45:53,110
I think it's so important to new ideas
and new like, like your show, like the,

1937
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:57,980
I love the idea of the hybrid between
a reality show and like strip mugshot

1938
01:45:58,190 --> 01:46:00,350
shit. But funny, like that clip was great.

1939
01:46:00,351 --> 01:46:03,110
I'm really looking forward to watching
your show now because of that one clip.

1940
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:06,380
Like, that's like, well, you,
you, you, you, you showed a cliff,

1941
01:46:06,410 --> 01:46:08,990
you tweeted a clip about my, I don't
even know if you knew it was my show.

1942
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:12,030
That last text ad thing.
Didn't you tweet that? Uh,

1943
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:17,390
the wheelchair tweeting, talking
about, uh, the last texts he ever sent.

1944
01:46:17,450 --> 01:46:21,380
Did you send that at least
not the titties? Yes. That
was my, that's for my show.

1945
01:46:21,850 --> 01:46:24,470
I know. So you're watching it. You don't
even know you're watching it. That's good.

1946
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:28,160
Um, yeah. So you're a good sign. Yeah. So
people are watching it and tweeting about,

1947
01:46:28,161 --> 01:46:31,490
and they don't even know my name. That's
awesome man. Yeah, that's really cool.

1948
01:46:31,491 --> 01:46:34,070
Including Joe Rogan. Well, it's
beginning, you know, I mean that's,

1949
01:46:34,071 --> 01:46:37,500
everybody starts from a beginning
point and you're, you're,

1950
01:46:37,501 --> 01:46:40,220
you're off to the races.
So I'm psyched about it.

1951
01:46:40,221 --> 01:46:43,670
But I think it's cool that comedy central
is trying like new ideas and taking

1952
01:46:43,671 --> 01:46:46,370
new chances like that for what
the new regime, it's, yeah.

1953
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:49,710
It's like a lot of the same guys over and
over again and were getting like a lot

1954
01:46:49,711 --> 01:46:50,160
of stale

1955
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:50,620
shit,

1956
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:53,840
you know? Yeah. I mean, I, you know that
old regime, but I didn't know anybody,

1957
01:46:53,890 --> 01:46:54,650
those people,
but

1958
01:46:54,650 --> 01:46:58,010
this is how bad it was. You know the show
make me hard that I told you about it.

1959
01:46:58,011 --> 01:46:59,900
Yeah.
They wouldn't let us use the word hard.

1960
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:04,610
The argument was it's
too mean or too vulgar.

1961
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:08,840
Let's make it make me Steph. And I
go, are you fucking serious? I go,

1962
01:47:08,841 --> 01:47:12,230
are we really having this conversation?
You're really telling me that make me,

1963
01:47:12,231 --> 01:47:16,190
Steph is less offensive than make me hard.
You would like us to change the sign.

1964
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:21,050
Yes. That's how we feel. Women. Nutty.

1965
01:47:21,051 --> 01:47:25,820
Crazy fucks. This is post nine
11 boners right though it was.

1966
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:28,910
That was even before
the Janet Jackson thing.

1967
01:47:28,911 --> 01:47:32,180
The Janet Jackson thing happened in the
middle of Doug and I do in the Manchild.

1968
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:35,420
Oh, that was the craziest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1969
01:47:35,421 --> 01:47:37,340
I thought that was going to
have no effect. I was like,

1970
01:47:37,341 --> 01:47:40,090
why would anybody give him a Fox?
She pulls her tit out in the Superbowl,

1971
01:47:40,130 --> 01:47:44,420
whatever. But meanwhile,
these people were scrambling.

1972
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:47,030
We showed up on the
set on Monday and they,

1973
01:47:47,031 --> 01:47:50,780
we had to have a special meeting where
they killed like half of our fucking

1974
01:47:50,781 --> 01:47:54,620
monologues, half of our thousand
crazy time. Just cause you know,

1975
01:47:54,621 --> 01:47:57,890
it was a bunch of weasels who were
worried about losing their jobs.

1976
01:47:57,891 --> 01:48:01,610
So they start scrambling to appease the
world and then the advertiser going,

1977
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:03,770
what is the way the people,

1978
01:48:03,771 --> 01:48:07,730
the American people are
outraged at television. Oh,

1979
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:09,610
we're going to show off and everything up.
Well,

1980
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:13,550
I want to keep my job and I want to keep
my nice house and I want to buy a boat.

1981
01:48:13,551 --> 01:48:15,230
So we're going to polish
it up and we're gonna,

1982
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:17,410
we're gonna give the American people what
they bought. What do they want them on?

1983
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:19,050
No tests, no tests, no tests.

1984
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:23,360
So we had the man show and we had all
these nutty fucking sketches that we

1985
01:48:23,361 --> 01:48:27,830
wanted to do. I was craziness and naked
people and shit. No, no, no, no, no.

1986
01:48:27,831 --> 01:48:31,280
They started, they started to hacking
at it. Everything controversial.

1987
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:35,780
That's crazy. I remember at that Lou
Reed, while walk on the wild side,

1988
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:39,860
they edited that song for radio
after the Janet Jackson thing.

1989
01:48:39,861 --> 01:48:43,020
That song been airing for 30
for 30 years on the radio.

1990
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:47,480
God took out a line from that song on the
radio and Lou Reed fucking flipped the

1991
01:48:47,481 --> 01:48:49,440
line.
There's a line,

1992
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:53,550
it's slipped in there that
that's something about
something giving head. Yeah,

1993
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:58,100
and it was his given head. It's
never, it had never been given head.

1994
01:48:58,880 --> 01:48:59,790
Hey Babe,
take a while.

1995
01:49:00,170 --> 01:49:03,800
And He'd been erring on the
radio on regular rock stations.

1996
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:07,700
Perfectly fine for 30 years after
Janet Jackson's Boob. They edit it.

1997
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:12,740
Yeah, there's a crazy, there's a weird
clamp down in this, this world today.

1998
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:16,340
And I think part of it has
to be attributed to the
fact that people know that

1999
01:49:16,341 --> 01:49:18,210
the world is insane and the,

2000
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:23,310
the more they can sort of tighten
things down and regulate and stop and no

2001
01:49:24,321 --> 01:49:29,321
assault guns and no drugs and no swearing
and know and the more like control

2002
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:34,310
that they can have over over people,
what they do,

2003
01:49:34,311 --> 01:49:38,870
what they say or what,
what sort of ideology gets broadcast.

2004
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:39,920
The more they can do that,

2005
01:49:39,921 --> 01:49:44,200
the better because then it allows
them to believe somehow or another,

2006
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:48,580
they've got at least a small
hold on this fucking craziness

2007
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:51,360
that's in front of them, which is
the human species right now. I mean,

2008
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:54,130
you look at the Internet and you see what
the fuck people are really all about.

2009
01:49:54,150 --> 01:49:55,300
Yeah. Trust me, I've been there.

2010
01:49:55,660 --> 01:50:00,250
It's loads and head's getting cut off and
car accidents and fucking lion attacks.

2011
01:50:00,251 --> 01:50:04,390
That's the Internet. Goddamn, it's 30%
porn. My first buddy you've got got the,

2012
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:06,220
got the Internet. I remember
going and he's like, dude,

2013
01:50:06,221 --> 01:50:09,700
the first thing I saw in there, just look
at this a guy's head inside a vagina.

2014
01:50:09,990 --> 01:50:13,780
Yeah. I'm like, dude, I don't know what
the Internet is, but I'm already on board.

2015
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:18,340
I like this. I like where this, where
this business going. I want stock. Yeah.

2016
01:50:18,341 --> 01:50:20,980
You can find out a lot of things that
are possible that you would like.

2017
01:50:20,981 --> 01:50:24,430
There's no way. Come on. Porn, uh,

2018
01:50:24,431 --> 01:50:27,250
represents 30% of the Internet.

2019
01:50:27,820 --> 01:50:32,800
I find that that even sounds a
little bit small, but that's a lot.

2020
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:36,810
No, someone gave me a list.
Someone gave me a list of the uh,

2021
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:39,760
the top I think it was,
and we were doing,

2022
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:42,160
trying to figure out marketing
or something for the show
and the list of the top

2023
01:50:42,161 --> 01:50:46,120
websites in the world.
It was the craziest,

2024
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:49,630
I knew everyone. It was like, I'm
not even kidding. 12 of the 20,

2025
01:50:49,631 --> 01:50:54,631
it was like porn hub and then be
like five down cnn.com it was like,

2026
01:50:55,570 --> 01:50:57,790
like stuff that I found out about later,
like x hamster.

2027
01:50:57,850 --> 01:50:59,100
If you ever heard of x Hammes yes.

2028
01:50:59,350 --> 01:51:02,950
X Hamster was like number three
or something and like, you know,

2029
01:51:02,951 --> 01:51:07,660
a Google was below, like it was insane.
The real porn or the real internet,

2030
01:51:07,730 --> 01:51:11,050
that's where the real money is quite
charging the have the internet.

2031
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:14,350
If you think about it is more,
I mean 30% is like a weird number,

2032
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:16,720
but if you stop and think
about what it really means,

2033
01:51:16,721 --> 01:51:21,190
it's almost a third 3% I still think
that's a conservative number, but even,

2034
01:51:21,191 --> 01:51:24,970
let's say it is a third,
he said you really do one at a three.

2035
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:28,750
I think it's higher than that.
Most Internet traffic,

2036
01:51:28,751 --> 01:51:31,830
more than one a three is porn just
from the numbers I've seen before,

2037
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:35,770
but I'm saying, yeah, for me it's 90
but you, but you know you're wrong,

2038
01:51:35,930 --> 01:51:39,360
but something wrong with you. Of course.
I know I've got, I've got issues man.

2039
01:51:39,370 --> 01:51:42,800
But you know that you don't represent
most people? No, I think I see.

2040
01:51:42,910 --> 01:51:45,180
I think because I'm open about it,
I'm probably not as,

2041
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:47,680
I'm probably not as dark as
the most people. Most people,

2042
01:51:47,681 --> 01:51:51,340
it's probably 98 comedians are one of
the few that are allowed to talk freely

2043
01:51:51,341 --> 01:51:55,020
about beating off without fear of losing
our jobs to that's true, but let's say,

2044
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:58,240
let's see, let's say it is, it
is a third. You're not even,

2045
01:51:58,241 --> 01:52:01,090
that's crazy to think that one third
of the time spent on the Internet is

2046
01:52:01,091 --> 01:52:05,170
looking at porn. Yeah, that's
insane. That I think it is a third.

2047
01:52:05,171 --> 01:52:09,310
I think a third is probably pretty well
the or 30% good if you think about it,

2048
01:52:09,311 --> 01:52:12,880
that you have to use her so much for
email or work stuff and there is a lot of

2049
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:15,430
regular stuff you have to do. So
maybe that is right. I don't know.

2050
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:20,680
We were definitely entering tane entering
into some weird area where people are

2051
01:52:20,681 --> 01:52:25,120
trying to like slow down like
free expression. I think. Oh,

2052
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:26,530
there's some debauchery out there,
man.

2053
01:52:26,531 --> 01:52:29,590
I mean I listened when you go on those
porn sites and you hit the wrong button,

2054
01:52:29,591 --> 01:52:32,060
which I've done many times
or maybe maybe the right,

2055
01:52:32,130 --> 01:52:33,820
but how's he going to
say a lot of the night,

2056
01:52:33,850 --> 01:52:37,060
some nights it's the right button
hole. The man, if I seen some,

2057
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:42,610
like I didn't curse on that one.
Yeah, I've seen crazy shit on,

2058
01:52:42,611 --> 01:52:46,010
uh, uh, most of which, uh,
you know, I'd rather not talk

2059
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:50,720
about, but yeah, because, well, it led to
masturbation. It's, it's interesting how,

2060
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:54,780
okay, if that's true, that's
30% of the Internet. Um,

2061
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,270
which let's assume that's true.

2062
01:52:56,510 --> 01:53:01,510
And then those people who are watching
this porn on this massive amounts of

2063
01:53:01,791 --> 01:53:02,900
downloads and all this stuff,

2064
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:05,390
they're going to regular jobs
where they have to be restricted.

2065
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:08,780
They're going to regular jobs with Amy
the 30th right, but again, that's a lot.

2066
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:09,680
It's a lot.

2067
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:13,160
But the idea is that when they're at
work or when they're interacting with

2068
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:17,150
people for the majority of the time,
they have to suppress all of that.

2069
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,220
Like all of that is inside of their head,

2070
01:53:19,221 --> 01:53:22,610
but the internet doesn't represent how
you communicate in the corporate world.

2071
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:23,840
It doesn't communicate.

2072
01:53:23,841 --> 01:53:27,860
It doesn't represent how you communicate
in in your average everyday experience.

2073
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:32,120
You're like way more like conservative,
way more buttoned down,

2074
01:53:32,121 --> 01:53:33,890
way more like suppressed.

2075
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:36,410
That's why I love comedy because
not to go back to my show,

2076
01:53:36,411 --> 01:53:39,420
but we do a bit on the show.
We have a barbershop quartet countdown,

2077
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:41,060
the top internet porn videos of the week,

2078
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:44,810
so like you would come into our office
and the writers and the prisoner all

2079
01:53:44,811 --> 01:53:49,040
around just look watching porn to find
the best titles. That's a job, right?

2080
01:53:49,070 --> 01:53:52,550
We get paid for that. Just to look
at, just to look at funny porn titles.

2081
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,920
I fucking love it. Yeah, it's a, there's,

2082
01:53:54,921 --> 01:53:57,530
and there's some really fucking
funny ones, man. We, we pull,

2083
01:53:57,540 --> 01:54:01,600
we were talking about Annabella
Chong yesterday, who was
the first woman to do a,

2084
01:54:01,601 --> 01:54:04,910
a gang bang. And she,
uh, she actually, yeah,

2085
01:54:04,911 --> 01:54:08,650
she actually did it because
she was, um, she was a, uh,

2086
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:11,900
a woman's studies, uh, students,

2087
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:16,900
I believe at a USC. And
she was, uh, trying to, uh,

2088
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:21,740
trying to figure out like,
like what's,

2089
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:25,670
she wanted to be like a female stud,
like the female version of a stud.

2090
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:28,970
So she fucked like 69
dudes and a in movies.

2091
01:54:28,971 --> 01:54:30,980
But when you look at like this,

2092
01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:35,820
it wasn't that many years ago.
Uh,

2093
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:37,760
95 at the age of 22,

2094
01:54:37,761 --> 01:54:42,761
she became famous by engaging in 251
sex acts with 69 women are six 69 men

2095
01:54:43,191 --> 01:54:47,300
rather over a 10 hour period with the
resulting footage being promoted as the

2096
01:54:47,301 --> 01:54:50,810
world's biggest gang. Bang,
Huh? Yeah. But they're,

2097
01:54:50,811 --> 01:54:55,450
the names of the titles were
fucking hilarious. Um, yeah, no,

2098
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:59,600
we have some, my favorite
was, um, my favorite one that
we, of course, I don't know,

2099
01:54:59,601 --> 01:55:02,300
he'd have to bleep it.
It was chubby honey has a bushy pussy.

2100
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:07,080
Not chubby honey has a bush and
hearing a barbershop quartet singing,

2101
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:10,250
it's pretty great. But just, I mean, you
can't write anything funnier than that.

2102
01:55:10,490 --> 01:55:14,120
Yeah. I'm trying to find her,
uh, when I was in San Diego,

2103
01:55:14,121 --> 01:55:18,700
this is what was on the TV at the
Hoover tower room. Joe Ass factor.

2104
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:24,080
Oh No.
Is that Eisa Assa probably as harsh.

2105
01:55:24,090 --> 01:55:26,000
She takes it up the butter all the time.
Yeah.

2106
01:55:26,001 --> 01:55:29,420
They could probably go to jail for that.
That you stealing fear factors thing.

2107
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:33,140
But that's a, they always, um,
have really funny names. Like,

2108
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:35,690
here's one that she was in.
Uh, Annabella [inaudible],

2109
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:38,540
sergeant pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Gang Bang.

2110
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:42,410
I would watch that right now.
Here's another one.

2111
01:55:42,411 --> 01:55:44,160
What's a nice girl like you doing it?
An anal

2112
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:44,993
movie?

2113
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,190
Legitimate question.
Yeah.

2114
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:52,710
Um, anal queen. I can't
believe I did the whole team.

2115
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:57,520
Whoops.
Yeah.

2116
01:55:57,690 --> 01:55:59,670
When there was no gang
bangs and I was a kid,

2117
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:01,870
there's a really good
porn I would recommend.

2118
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:06,640
It's called tonight's girlfriend and
it's this guy that just like pays porn

2119
01:56:06,641 --> 01:56:08,200
stars to be hookers for the night.

2120
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:09,870
Wow.
And he makes a video on it.

2121
01:56:10,010 --> 01:56:10,670
Yeah.

2122
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:13,680
That sounds a little bit like that Boogie
nights scene a little bit where she'd

2123
01:56:13,681 --> 01:56:17,390
stops in the limo on the side of the right
on the street. Yeah. It's Kinda like,

2124
01:56:17,391 --> 01:56:21,650
uh, like he makes some shower, uh, at
the beginning of every thing really.

2125
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:24,620
What's it called? It's called, I believe
it's called tonight's girlfriend.

2126
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:26,930
And the reason I like it is
not that because of that,

2127
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:29,540
it's just filling the rather,
he does a good job of filming it.

2128
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:33,710
So what do you like the way it's like
the cinematography? Yeah. It's, I mean,

2129
01:56:33,711 --> 01:56:36,680
some people just have better, I like good
cinematography, so I'll check it out.

2130
01:56:36,970 --> 01:56:40,540
Yeah. Wow. And this
guy a, is it a website?

2131
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:44,150
I don't know if it's a website.
I've just seen a few of the videos online.

2132
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:48,000
So a lot of those girls will work as
escorts. Right. Is that how it works?

2133
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:52,850
I think he, he, I think the
idea is that they're not really,

2134
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:55,970
they're playing escorts for the
movie or at least most of them.

2135
01:56:55,971 --> 01:56:58,870
But then if you think about that they're
actually getting paid to have sex and

2136
01:56:58,871 --> 01:57:03,460
they're actually being so kind
of a prostitute. Anyone? Yeah.

2137
01:57:03,461 --> 01:57:04,440
So kind of,

2138
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:09,630
well, I read one girl saying that she
was, I read an article about a, um, uh,

2139
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:10,540
a brothel,

2140
01:57:10,570 --> 01:57:13,240
one of those Nevada brothels and there
was a porn star started working at the

2141
01:57:13,241 --> 01:57:14,980
brothel and her attitude was,
well,

2142
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:19,210
porn is just sort of like a revolving
brothel anyway. And I was like, Ooh,

2143
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:22,970
it's true. How is it not true? Yeah.

2144
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:26,980
And it was weird like listening to her
talk about her attitude towards it.

2145
01:57:26,981 --> 01:57:29,800
Like as long as she gets to go
home to her man, she was fine.

2146
01:57:29,801 --> 01:57:32,420
She was talking about that, like,
so then the guy was asking me, well,

2147
01:57:32,421 --> 01:57:35,920
do you do like weekend trips?
Do we who do? Well, you'll
do that. And she goes, well,

2148
01:57:35,921 --> 01:57:38,620
it would have to be a ridiculous
amount of money to keep me from my man.

2149
01:57:38,710 --> 01:57:42,190
I was like, oh honey, I'm sorry.

2150
01:57:42,191 --> 01:57:46,330
I got to go make a couple of couple
of g's suck in some cock. But uh,

2151
01:57:46,331 --> 01:57:48,040
when I come back,
I'm going to buy a motorcycle.

2152
01:57:49,930 --> 01:57:54,500
I would take that deal with Jim.
You say that now? I wouldn't,

2153
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:55,840
I would not be able to do that now.

2154
01:57:55,841 --> 01:57:58,330
We had an escort on the show
and I was asking her like,

2155
01:57:58,331 --> 01:58:01,480
what the differences between escorting
a prostitute in which you say,

2156
01:58:01,870 --> 01:58:05,290
and she's like, nothing. Well, this
escort that they blur out her face. No,

2157
01:58:05,291 --> 01:58:08,470
we got to be showed her and she said,
I'm, if I'm a, basically she goes,

2158
01:58:08,471 --> 01:58:12,860
I'm just a prostitute. Wow.
Differences a camera man. Yeah, yeah.

2159
01:58:13,130 --> 01:58:15,040
She's allowing you to film that week.
But we got it.

2160
01:58:15,041 --> 01:58:18,100
But we got her number through
legitimate sources. You know,

2161
01:58:18,101 --> 01:58:22,930
it was like online legit prostitutes
source. No, no escorts. Escorts are legit.

2162
01:58:23,410 --> 01:58:26,100
Oh yes. We've got an escort. She comes
over, says she's just like, yell,

2163
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:30,460
fuck you for whatever. She was
attractive. I wet chatted with her,

2164
01:58:30,461 --> 01:58:33,250
with my dad on the show, showed her
to my dad. My Dad's like, you know,

2165
01:58:33,251 --> 01:58:36,700
that's a very attractive. So you never
met her in person, you just web? No, no,

2166
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:41,080
me and her are web web chat with my
called my dad back in Kentucky. Oh,

2167
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:42,090
you were there right next

2168
01:58:42,090 --> 01:58:42,970
door and you called your dad?

2169
01:58:43,150 --> 01:58:46,590
She was attractive and my dad even
said as much and she was a prostitute.

2170
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:49,850
She tried to hook it up with, you know,
she knew I didn't have, she didn't,

2171
01:58:49,851 --> 01:58:50,800
she knew it was,
it was,

2172
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:53,530
it was a young show and I didn't have
the cash that she was looking for.

2173
01:58:53,590 --> 01:58:57,130
How much cash you looking for? What
did she say? Well, here's the thing,

2174
01:58:57,131 --> 01:58:59,890
you don't want to go down that road
because all of a sudden you were chipping

2175
01:58:59,891 --> 01:59:03,820
Norton. I can't speak for
him, but I'll speak for him.

2176
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:08,440
I'm not shy. I, uh, it,
it felt like, it felt,

2177
01:59:08,510 --> 01:59:12,280
it would, it would have been odd. I'm
kind of a pussy. I didn't want to do it.

2178
01:59:12,580 --> 01:59:15,340
I get freaked out by like germs
and stuff. So I thought, Oh,

2179
01:59:15,341 --> 01:59:18,300
you're one of those guys. I thought
it'd be weird to have sex with him.

2180
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:21,490
When you first meet a girl and before
you get busy do you started asking

2181
01:59:21,491 --> 01:59:25,570
questions?
So I asked him like in subtle ways,

2182
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:29,590
I don't ask him like if you asked a girl
that you get kind of a slap if you're

2183
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:33,910
really not slap, but apparently you don't.
But you know like just kind of like,

2184
01:59:33,911 --> 01:59:38,710
you know like, like you know like
do you like to party or like coke?

2185
01:59:38,770 --> 01:59:40,630
Yeah, exactly. Like I
tried to figure it out.

2186
01:59:40,631 --> 01:59:44,830
Like you just smoke or like other things
that would like lead them to a road of

2187
01:59:44,831 --> 01:59:45,664
debauchery.

2188
01:59:46,370 --> 01:59:49,420
What would you feel like if you were
with a girl for a long time and then you

2189
01:59:49,421 --> 01:59:52,660
found out a few years back just to
the gang bang movie but she quit.

2190
01:59:52,690 --> 01:59:57,070
It was bad experience. I would just let
down. I mean what about I would flip out.

2191
01:59:57,300 --> 02:00:00,550
You would flip out and totally. Would you
be mad at her? No, not mad. I would just,

2192
02:00:00,551 --> 02:00:03,130
I don't know that I can be with her
if she was awesome. Other than that.

2193
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:05,830
What if like up until that moment,
like this chick's perfect check.

2194
02:00:05,890 --> 02:00:08,200
I mean did she go through a lot
of therapy after the gang? Nope.

2195
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:12,100
She just realized, you know what gang
bangs or not for me, I'm moving on,

2196
02:00:12,650 --> 02:00:15,240
I'm going to time to start
teaching Yoga Gang Bang.

2197
02:00:15,530 --> 02:00:18,640
Like you just don't wake up some morning
gang bangs or not for me. Maybe you do.

2198
02:00:18,641 --> 02:00:21,640
You know what I mean? People, my friend
Dave, I told you he crashed his car,

2199
02:00:21,641 --> 02:00:24,160
never had a drink again. You know,
went to a little bit of court,

2200
02:00:24,161 --> 02:00:26,760
ordered a alcoholics anonymous.
But I think other than that,

2201
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:30,340
you know what in your scenario and your
this scenario that she's a completely

2202
02:00:30,341 --> 02:00:34,090
new person, I'm going to give her the
benefit of the doubt. I mean not really,

2203
02:00:34,091 --> 02:00:35,690
but I just in theoretically,
yeah,

2204
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:39,280
but if you went down on a little extra
salty would you worry that's just some

2205
02:00:39,281 --> 02:00:42,570
load creeping out and go to the gang gang
had been camping up there for a while

2206
02:00:42,571 --> 02:00:44,770
and I would check myself into an
emergency room and stay there.

2207
02:00:44,890 --> 02:00:49,000
I stayed there for probably two years
and I would pay for it on my all myself.

2208
02:00:49,630 --> 02:00:52,180
You couldn't watch, right? You
wouldn't want to watch the gang bang.

2209
02:00:53,170 --> 02:00:54,910
But someone told you about
it and they sent you show.

2210
02:00:54,970 --> 02:00:59,020
Even watching gang bangs in general
me numb. Yeah. It's not a gang banger.

2211
02:00:59,080 --> 02:01:01,870
I'm not even a two on one sort of a guy.
I don't like watching that either.

2212
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:07,420
I think it'd be able to talk to these
guys like us who are more open talking

2213
02:01:07,421 --> 02:01:11,380
about porn, who probably watch it
the least. Maybe. I don't know.

2214
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,440
Miami. I think it's the same
people who were quiet about it,

2215
02:01:14,441 --> 02:01:17,440
who are the real sickos probably
the least fucked up watching it.

2216
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:19,990
But then I have daughters.

2217
02:01:19,991 --> 02:01:24,070
So porn took on a completely
different dimension since uh,

2218
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:29,110
since I've had kids. It's, this is a weird
thing where you're looking at a porn,

2219
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:32,130
like you know for a fact that
that used to be a baby. Yeah.

2220
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:33,400
That was someone's little girl.

2221
02:01:33,401 --> 02:01:36,790
There was some oh daddy and hugging on
to and now she's getting plugged in the

2222
02:01:36,791 --> 02:01:40,460
ass and the mouth and she's
gagging and that's reality man.

2223
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:45,080
I mean that girl you putting it up and
she's got her tongue out now on some Jews

2224
02:01:45,081 --> 02:01:49,070
just fucking jizzing all over her face.
That used to be a baby girl.

2225
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:52,690
There's no way to get around
that and then babies of your own,

2226
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:55,130
it totally fucks with your,
your, your vision of it.

2227
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:56,900
I guess so. Yeah, so that, that's,

2228
02:01:57,140 --> 02:01:59,510
that's why I don't want to have kids
because I want to keep watching.

2229
02:01:59,660 --> 02:02:00,890
Like you want to keep
checking off the porch.

2230
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:05,500
That's when dudes move on to milfs see
the four guys who were really in the east.

2231
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:08,530
It's like you can't even think about
them being a baby anymore because it just

2232
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:12,810
like 40 and only likes black guys now
have you noticed that when you watch porn

2233
02:02:12,811 --> 02:02:13,644
though that's like,

2234
02:02:13,670 --> 02:02:18,670
it's like every video was a different
girl but it's like four or five guys

2235
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:22,510
total and all of the same guys,
the same guys over and over.

2236
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,310
They say a lot of that is because
it's hard to do like it's hard to,

2237
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:29,380
I'm sure guys to get it up in front of
strangers and cameras like and know that

2238
02:02:29,381 --> 02:02:33,970
people are going to watch your Dick and
be comfortable and you say you could.

2239
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:37,780
You think you could seriously please.
You panic when you stand up.

2240
02:02:37,820 --> 02:02:41,800
Little half of black little, a little
bit of black power in me. I'm fine. Yeah.

2241
02:02:41,830 --> 02:02:42,663
You say that

2242
02:02:43,230 --> 02:02:46,710
people find out small. Your Dick really
is. They would go, what the Fuck Brian,

2243
02:02:46,711 --> 02:02:50,280
you said it was big. Jesus. What's wrong?
You don't tell the truth about anything.

2244
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:52,470
Ever said it was big.
That's all I've been in here.

2245
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:57,480
He can do pour certainly said it
was big. No please. That's big.

2246
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:01,140
Yeah, that's big. I just said
a little bit. What's average?

2247
02:03:02,150 --> 02:03:03,480
What's the average ticket you've socked?

2248
02:03:05,110 --> 02:03:06,870
I would say like five,

2249
02:03:07,180 --> 02:03:09,310
but honestly though,
not even as a joke.

2250
02:03:09,550 --> 02:03:10,960
How would you know what averages nowadays?

2251
02:03:10,961 --> 02:03:13,390
Because all the only gets you see are
on porn and those are guys who are

2252
02:03:13,391 --> 02:03:15,160
professional.
The only things that you see,

2253
02:03:15,580 --> 02:03:17,590
this dude is always asking
people to show their tech.

2254
02:03:17,591 --> 02:03:20,920
So he's got some constantly
going around measuring. No, no,

2255
02:03:20,950 --> 02:03:24,670
I definitely not my tape. I definitely
have the Internet, so I've seen all sides.

2256
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:27,140
That's what I'm saying. And your
defense and your defense, the Dicks,

2257
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:29,990
you're seeing the cream of
the crop. Don't to know. No,

2258
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:31,600
you're seeing the best dicks in the world.

2259
02:03:31,601 --> 02:03:34,630
If you ever know the juiciest
most delicious, you're seeing,

2260
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:36,910
you're seeing the guys who
get paid for those dicks.

2261
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:40,620
Don't compare yourself to that. Talk
amongst yourselves. I gotta pee mostly

2262
02:03:40,620 --> 02:03:45,570
comics dicks nowadays. Those are
probably smaller than yeah, yeah.

2263
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:49,140
I don't know. So, uh, you, uh,

2264
02:03:49,570 --> 02:03:53,460
you're on your fifth or sixth episode of
the show. You've really been listening,

2265
02:03:53,461 --> 02:03:57,810
man. Jesus Christ. You
know, how many third,

2266
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:02,970
third episode, three episode five more.
Uh, but how many of you recorded, oh,

2267
02:04:02,971 --> 02:04:03,804
we're done.

2268
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:08,940
I actually came from the editing
studio just now to wrap the last one.

2269
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:12,270
Like we're wrapped as of today,
right? And we're done with all aid.

2270
02:04:12,390 --> 02:04:15,330
Now you with the clip that we
saw was completely uncensored.

2271
02:04:15,331 --> 02:04:18,960
Like the language and everything like
that. Are you getting the beat treatment?

2272
02:04:18,970 --> 02:04:22,600
We're getting the bleeps but um,
you can watch them all on a little.

2273
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:24,390
Most of the clips around censored online.

2274
02:04:24,490 --> 02:04:28,560
I wasn't talking to them like most of
the clips are uncensored online and um,

2275
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:30,180
there's a pos,
there's some talk,

2276
02:04:30,181 --> 02:04:34,680
I don't want to say yet that we may be
able to show some uncensored versions

2277
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,920
late at night or midnight
or I don't what the rule is,

2278
02:04:37,921 --> 02:04:39,420
but I don't want to promise anything.

2279
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:43,110
But there has been chatter about that
so I want to get a buzz going about it.

2280
02:04:43,370 --> 02:04:47,100
Right. But I don't want it to
be official, you know? Yeah.

2281
02:04:47,470 --> 02:04:51,330
Well I mean South Park did
it, you know, they are moving
south park, you know, they,

2282
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:52,830
and also south park

2283
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:57,030
is TVMA cause they were
just like we don't want it.

2284
02:04:57,150 --> 02:05:00,120
You can't Air TV and
maybe before 10 which is,

2285
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:03,990
you know when they say shit and fucking
stuff so that you can only air the new

2286
02:05:03,991 --> 02:05:06,930
South Park's after 10.
But they said they don't give you no,

2287
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:11,880
we don't care because those early,
those early reruns are,

2288
02:05:11,881 --> 02:05:14,040
uh, um, what's going on,

2289
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:17,570
Joe of get through the curtain and we
have these new curtains in the studio and

2290
02:05:17,571 --> 02:05:21,770
like, it's just like, you
know, have to try to find the
opening of a curtain. Yeah.

2291
02:05:21,771 --> 02:05:26,160
The Joe Rogan experience without Joe
Rogan's it'll get a little weird. Um,

2292
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:29,280
are you, are you, like
you said you're, are you,

2293
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:32,810
are you like the kind of person you don't
like to shake people's hands and stuff

2294
02:05:32,811 --> 02:05:34,510
like that doesn't bother
me as much anymore. I mean,

2295
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:38,330
it used to a little ass play as play is
different because that's a nice clean

2296
02:05:38,331 --> 02:05:41,450
ass. You've wiped it and everything
maybe I did is not really cleaning it.

2297
02:05:41,451 --> 02:05:44,330
Well imagine if someone's smooth shit
on your face and you just took a little

2298
02:05:44,331 --> 02:05:47,550
piece of toilet paper and wipe it off.
No, that wouldn't really work. Yeah,

2299
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:50,310
really clean that shit. Really. It's,

2300
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:52,430
it's really a shower is the only
thing that way to clean it up.

2301
02:05:52,750 --> 02:05:55,040
We've got to get in there. Well, I
got one of those Japanese toilets.

2302
02:05:55,041 --> 02:05:57,800
I still have him fucking installed
it. Yeah, cause I'm so God damn busy.

2303
02:05:57,801 --> 02:06:02,750
But one of the ones that you
and I experienced, right. I
always wanted to try one.

2304
02:06:02,751 --> 02:06:05,060
It's the best I should
have had it here for you.

2305
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:06,800
You just stay on the toilet longer though.

2306
02:06:06,801 --> 02:06:09,590
Like you find yourself and you
just want to feel the water shit,

2307
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:12,410
squirt it in your ass and you just
don't want to stop it. I need,

2308
02:06:12,580 --> 02:06:15,500
what if I get a season two
that's my first charge.

2309
02:06:15,610 --> 02:06:20,310
Warm the seats warm and it blows air
on your asshole after cleans megahertz.

2310
02:06:20,330 --> 02:06:21,290
Stern talking about that.

2311
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:24,020
It's a whole thing where it like
goes up and the whole thing.

2312
02:06:24,510 --> 02:06:27,250
Some ladies that finds her butthole and
that shoots it right in there. Yeah.

2313
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:30,950
This has reminded me to go get that
fucking thing out of my garage and having

2314
02:06:30,951 --> 02:06:34,550
installed installed here. Yeah. You
got the be, if you've got it installed,

2315
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:38,450
we're almost a studio's almost done.
We've got the curtains up now, Ben,

2316
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:41,030
and you're here to break in the curtains.
Yeah. I'm here at this exciting,

2317
02:06:41,031 --> 02:06:43,760
it feels like show business, right?
Curtains. Something about show business.

2318
02:06:43,761 --> 02:06:46,630
It's about time with the big,
we've got the big animal outside and uh,

2319
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:49,100
that's a werewolf buddy. It's on
animal. It's a werewolf. Look, sorry,

2320
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:52,880
we got everything. It's cool. There's
a song that I really want to play,

2321
02:06:52,881 --> 02:06:56,500
but I don't know if we should play by ear.
You remember the dance floor Dale?

2322
02:06:56,620 --> 02:07:00,170
Yeah. There's another guy,
uh, that makes us made a song.

2323
02:07:00,230 --> 02:07:05,230
His name is Mike Diva and it's called
I'm on crack and it's just like that and

2324
02:07:05,331 --> 02:07:10,270
it's so fucking good song
that's like registered like,
or is it on the, you know,

2325
02:07:10,280 --> 02:07:13,130
I think he's just one of those guys that's
on youtube that just makes these cute

2326
02:07:13,131 --> 02:07:14,960
little like minute videos
based on really good.

2327
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:18,920
As long as it's not like on like
universal records or something like that.

2328
02:07:18,921 --> 02:07:22,790
You know, were some big record
company. Say what it's from.

2329
02:07:23,330 --> 02:07:27,260
He just does like a weekly
video. Everything. We can do
it. I think we would like,

2330
02:07:27,270 --> 02:07:31,700
it was just, well, what's his name again?
His name is on Youtube. It's Mike Diva.

2331
02:07:31,730 --> 02:07:35,410
It's all one word, you know, a million
people going to listen to us easy.

2332
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:38,890
So it's kind of fucked up that we even
have to, you know, like we should,

2333
02:07:38,891 --> 02:07:41,950
we should be good. We're
helping, we're helping people.

2334
02:07:41,951 --> 02:07:45,940
But you have to worry the Internet.
Isn't this, have you had problems? No,

2335
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,720
but we have insurance for it and we
have, um, we also have lawyers now. Oh,

2336
02:07:49,721 --> 02:07:52,240
here we'll play, we'll
play. Let's play half of it.

2337
02:07:52,241 --> 02:07:54,760
So you would show something of
it? Yeah. Okay. So we're, we're,

2338
02:07:54,761 --> 02:07:56,710
we're also signing up
to a couple of programs

2339
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:04,790
back
to

2340
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:10,110
the club will feel master. I said fuck
that shit on. Went back to the bullying.

2341
02:08:12,430 --> 02:08:13,670
I kept that

2342
02:08:17,850 --> 02:08:21,610
right, right, right, right.

2343
02:08:32,620 --> 02:08:33,670
Okay. Hold on. Hold on.

2344
02:08:33,930 --> 02:08:38,010
This show is,
this music is unless inable it's so bad,

2345
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:41,860
but the video is really fast. I actually,
Mike Diva just made the video. Uh,

2346
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:46,910
that song is by a side project called
the left rights mindless self indulgence

2347
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:52,440
side project. Oh, okay. I mean,
in this particular environment,

2348
02:08:52,441 --> 02:08:56,190
it's mainly visual videos. Impossible
to listen to. It's got cats and crack.

2349
02:08:56,191 --> 02:09:00,120
I love it. It sounds hilarious. I can't
stop living around how many views?

2350
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:03,930
A 1.8 million.
Oh yeah.

2351
02:09:03,931 --> 02:09:07,680
I just loved the doctors possible that a
guy could just put out a video and it's

2352
02:09:07,890 --> 02:09:10,980
why does it have 1.8 million? Because a
bunch of people said, you got to see this.

2353
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:15,570
It's pretty wild to watch. Yeah,
let's do it, Mario. Yeah, it's great.

2354
02:09:15,571 --> 02:09:18,660
It's a great video, man. It's a great
video. I liked the song. I might buy it.

2355
02:09:19,140 --> 02:09:22,890
When you go to a video and you see
it's got 18 million views and like,

2356
02:09:22,891 --> 02:09:25,530
what the fuck? How do I not know about
this? How are these people? Well,

2357
02:09:25,531 --> 02:09:28,290
I've seen the ones with the
hundred million views and
I'm like, oh, how's that?

2358
02:09:28,291 --> 02:09:32,770
How's that even possible? I am style. What
did that get up to? A billion, billion,

2359
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:35,400
billion, billion. This is Mike
Diva. Actually. All his videos,

2360
02:09:35,550 --> 02:09:39,480
I have a lot of hits because he hit
that really has a billion views. Yeah.

2361
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:45,540
What are we now at 2.5 billion about
total humans? Yeah. Whoa. More than that.

2362
02:09:45,541 --> 02:09:50,160
Seven. We're at seven. Seven, 7 billion.
Yeah. What'd I get? No, 2.5 in no dice.

2363
02:09:50,250 --> 02:09:53,070
I was thinking maybe America
write no America, 300 million.

2364
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:56,430
Where do I get 2.5 minutes laughing at me.
You made it up.

2365
02:09:56,490 --> 02:10:01,350
Unless you live in the fifties I'm from
the fifties I mean you just gave up

2366
02:10:01,630 --> 02:10:05,700
million people in the world. Yes.
Well there's a billion in China alone.

2367
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:08,880
There's more than a billion in Africa.
Africa is 1.5 billion.

2368
02:10:08,910 --> 02:10:11,820
I didn't know there was a building.
Yeah. So okay, I fucked up. Yeah,

2369
02:10:11,821 --> 02:10:13,400
it's getting at least to start,
we're going to lose.

2370
02:10:13,410 --> 02:10:17,510
You won't be recorded for
life. It's getting crowded.
Lack a mind. Fuck. And yeah,

2371
02:10:17,700 --> 02:10:20,610
that's a lot of people.
Maybe Gangam style is not that popular.

2372
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:25,260
Well what's really funny, really a
billion people. It's 500,000 assholes.

2373
02:10:25,261 --> 02:10:27,380
We've watched it repeatedly ad nauseum.
No,

2374
02:10:27,390 --> 02:10:29,430
but on different computers though
cause he has to be different.

2375
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:34,160
I think it has to be different servers
really do you think really gives a fuck

2376
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:35,180
where the hell are coming from?

2377
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:38,240
It would want to elevate that had that
problem before because people were

2378
02:10:38,241 --> 02:10:42,010
putting their videos up and just pressing
refresh all day and night to get their,

2379
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:45,780
their counselor. It attracts
the IP address. So like it,

2380
02:10:46,180 --> 02:10:48,590
it counts as one view.
If you go to it,

2381
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:52,760
like if you watched the here and ain't
at home, it would count as two. Oh, okay.

2382
02:10:52,820 --> 02:10:57,260
But if we have different computers at
this Ip address, it would count as one.

2383
02:10:57,290 --> 02:11:01,320
Correct. Okay. And the head of you.
So that is, so that's a very pop.

2384
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:06,250
There's ways around that though. How
do you get around, uh, you use, uh,

2385
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:09,340
use proxies, proxies. You just
get this list of priorities.

2386
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:11,750
They must have had to do that
though for advertising purposes.

2387
02:11:11,751 --> 02:11:15,260
Because I sell advertisement now that
makes sense because they do it by CPM,

2388
02:11:15,261 --> 02:11:18,240
but how many downloads I get?
Totally. Yeah. Well if you buy it,

2389
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:22,250
if you say you've got millions of views
and some company buys your shit and it's

2390
02:11:22,251 --> 02:11:25,100
just some dude click it over and over,
they're going to be pissed, you know?

2391
02:11:25,101 --> 02:11:30,080
Have you thought about doing a podcast
at all? I thought about, I don't know,

2392
02:11:30,081 --> 02:11:33,110
I'd be a good accompaniment to your show
and that some people are telling me I

2393
02:11:33,111 --> 02:11:37,130
just, I'm not really a talker I think.
Are you talking about, I mean I dunno.

2394
02:11:37,970 --> 02:11:40,600
Yeah,
I don't feel like I would.

2395
02:11:41,980 --> 02:11:42,540
Okay.

2396
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:44,440
It's, I'm the wrong guy to ask
because again, like I said,

2397
02:11:44,441 --> 02:11:47,090
not a Ben Hoffman Fan so I'm the wrong
person to be asking you about this.

2398
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:50,600
But I just feel like I've kind of talked
out and I don't really like even on

2399
02:11:50,601 --> 02:11:54,080
this show I feel like I was done. I was
done in an hour. What do you do at home?

2400
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:55,810
Like when you get,
when you get home tonight or you do,

2401
02:11:55,811 --> 02:11:58,970
you just watch a lot of movies?
Hobby tonight. Cause I have,

2402
02:11:59,070 --> 02:12:03,620
we have an airing tonight so I have
to live tweet a new episode tonight.

2403
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:07,030
That's a new thing is you tweet along
with the show. Like that's nice. Yeah.

2404
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:10,400
Which is fine I guess. But, so I have
to go, but I don't have direct TV,

2405
02:12:10,430 --> 02:12:13,100
so I'll have to go to my friend's house
who has direct TV so I can watch the

2406
02:12:13,101 --> 02:12:15,200
east coast feed to live tweeted.

2407
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:19,040
A couple writers will show up and will
live tweet the shows. So that'll be fun.

2408
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:24,290
But uh, what was the question? I mean
like what do you do you have a girlfriend?

2409
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:28,790
[inaudible] listen question. I've
been talking to you with my therapist.

2410
02:12:29,210 --> 02:12:32,850
What the fuck am I doing
with my team? Yeah, yeah.

2411
02:12:33,400 --> 02:12:38,200
Even going to a therapist
10 years. Really? Yeah. Wow.

2412
02:12:38,230 --> 02:12:41,440
Oh Dude, I got issues. What's the
number one? Do you, can you tell us?

2413
02:12:41,730 --> 02:12:44,970
The number one would probably be OCD,
but what you're showing your hand.

2414
02:12:45,150 --> 02:12:46,360
I got to say like even today,

2415
02:12:46,390 --> 02:12:49,990
like I did shake your guys' hands when
I came in here and I just now remembered

2416
02:12:49,991 --> 02:12:50,471
that I did.

2417
02:12:50,471 --> 02:12:55,471
So it's working I guess because you dealt
with the fact that he shook our hands.

2418
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:57,250
Didn't go immediately wash yourself.

2419
02:12:57,280 --> 02:13:02,280
I'm saying not a big step for me is just
now remembering that two hours ago I

2420
02:13:02,321 --> 02:13:05,020
shook your hands in the old days,
I would've thought about at the time,

2421
02:13:05,230 --> 02:13:07,950
like my hands are like toxic or something.
Not that you're,

2422
02:13:08,010 --> 02:13:11,590
it's has nothing to do with the person.
Do a meet and greets after shows,

2423
02:13:11,740 --> 02:13:15,250
like theaters and I'll shake a
thousand people's hands. It never,

2424
02:13:15,410 --> 02:13:17,680
it never occurs to you, you
know, then I go eat. Really,

2425
02:13:17,681 --> 02:13:20,400
you don't wash your hands before
you were a case. You're, you,

2426
02:13:20,410 --> 02:13:24,310
you look at you need to and you shouldn't
be scared because there's nothing,

2427
02:13:25,540 --> 02:13:29,170
there's nothing bad about it. I'm going
to kill me with your sweat, but uh, no,

2428
02:13:29,171 --> 02:13:31,950
but see, I'm cured. I'm not
that cured, but getting closer,

2429
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:34,950
I'm, no, I tried to wash my hands
after I do that, but I have,

2430
02:13:35,010 --> 02:13:37,260
there's been times where I
haven't, you know, for sure,

2431
02:13:37,261 --> 02:13:39,660
especially if I've got a buzz on, I'm
like, yeah, fuck it. Let's go eat.

2432
02:13:39,970 --> 02:13:43,050
You know? I mean, literally, I've been to,

2433
02:13:43,140 --> 02:13:46,710
I was talking about this on another place.
I don't want to get into it too much,

2434
02:13:46,711 --> 02:13:48,840
but I had been to behavior
therapy where they actually,

2435
02:13:48,870 --> 02:13:52,530
where you literally get your hands dirty
and touch your face, touch yourself.

2436
02:13:52,640 --> 02:13:54,780
That's how they teach. Telly.
Telly teach you to do it.

2437
02:13:54,810 --> 02:13:58,350
What made you feel like you needed this?
It was interfering with my life.

2438
02:13:58,351 --> 02:14:01,350
Literally. Like I went to go
to the, I would be in my car,

2439
02:14:01,351 --> 02:14:05,100
I'd go get gas and that would be going
out to get my meet my friends and I had

2440
02:14:05,101 --> 02:14:09,630
to go back home to wash my hands.
Wow. Home couldn't go to a bathroom.

2441
02:14:10,310 --> 02:14:14,060
So then by the time you get through all
that shit, your day's gone. You know,

2442
02:14:14,330 --> 02:14:16,020
it interferes with anything.

2443
02:14:16,050 --> 02:14:18,360
All I care about is anything
that's interfering with my life.

2444
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:22,160
Do you have like hand sanitizer?
I don't, I don't touch this.

2445
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:25,610
I need to get your guy to Howie Mendell.
You know how he's, yeah, I know he's like,

2446
02:14:25,790 --> 02:14:29,160
but heroes. But he, he sounds
like he's not dealing with it,

2447
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:34,260
but he talks about it though. He talks
about it, but do it. I did work past it,

2448
02:14:35,550 --> 02:14:36,600
dealing with my issues.

2449
02:14:37,930 --> 02:14:40,150
You know what I like about that?
What you're dealing with,

2450
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:41,960
that you're willing to talk about it.
I think that's Super,

2451
02:14:42,310 --> 02:14:44,500
oh, that's the thing is it
was never shy about it, but I,

2452
02:14:44,790 --> 02:14:48,690
but that's huge shooting people,
but I had no issues. I like to,

2453
02:14:49,240 --> 02:14:53,140
to be open about it and deal with them
and that helps me kind of get rid of them.

2454
02:14:53,170 --> 02:14:56,080
Well, it also helps by gauging
other people's reactions,

2455
02:14:56,081 --> 02:14:58,240
whether or not it's a real
issue or whether or not it's,

2456
02:14:58,380 --> 02:15:02,280
well it was so bad, but yeah, family
members noticed it. That's how I knew it.

2457
02:15:02,281 --> 02:15:04,850
And I'm like, maybe this is because
I didn't know what OCD was. Right.

2458
02:15:05,070 --> 02:15:07,680
And I'm like, I read about
it and I'm like, shit,

2459
02:15:07,681 --> 02:15:11,670
I have this time to a hundred you
know, this is bad. And like there is a,

2460
02:15:12,330 --> 02:15:16,080
I can fix this and improve my life. I'm
like, that sounds interesting to me.

2461
02:15:16,210 --> 02:15:16,671
Yeah.
It's,

2462
02:15:16,671 --> 02:15:19,900
it's really bad to keep that stuff to
yourself if something's really fucking

2463
02:15:19,901 --> 02:15:20,201
with you.

2464
02:15:20,201 --> 02:15:24,310
Because I think that there's a lot of
insight that you get just from talking to

2465
02:15:24,311 --> 02:15:24,641
people.

2466
02:15:24,641 --> 02:15:27,400
Like I've had conversations with people
where they tell me something about

2467
02:15:27,401 --> 02:15:29,620
something fucked up about themselves
and they go, you know what?

2468
02:15:29,621 --> 02:15:31,960
I realize I'm not fucking doing
that anymore, man. I've, I've,

2469
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:32,950
I've seen people do though.

2470
02:15:33,020 --> 02:15:36,280
A friend of mine quit smoking in front
of me once he was, um, he was smoking.

2471
02:15:36,281 --> 02:15:39,970
We were about to go do a Gig and a, I
go, you are you smoking? And he goes,

2472
02:15:39,971 --> 02:15:41,560
I only smoked before shows.
I go,

2473
02:15:41,561 --> 02:15:44,920
but do you do shows like fucking four
days a week? And he goes, yeah. He goes,

2474
02:15:44,921 --> 02:15:47,440
I go with some, it seems like
you're smoking. And he goes, well,

2475
02:15:47,441 --> 02:15:51,400
I like a cigarette right before I
do a show. And I go, um, does it,

2476
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:54,370
have you done many shows without
it? And he goes, yeah, I mean,

2477
02:15:54,371 --> 02:15:57,250
I just started doing this. I go, God damn,
man. He goes, you know what? You're right.

2478
02:15:57,251 --> 02:15:59,230
What the fuck am I doing? I'm like,
well, yeah, what are you doing?

2479
02:15:59,430 --> 02:16:02,380
And so then he put his cigarette out and
he quit and he tells me like every time

2480
02:16:02,381 --> 02:16:05,770
I see him, I haven't smoked since.
No, it wasn't even that I helped him.

2481
02:16:05,771 --> 02:16:09,520
It's just that having that conversation
in front of somebody who reacts to it.

2482
02:16:09,521 --> 02:16:10,840
Like if someone says,
Hey Ben,

2483
02:16:10,841 --> 02:16:14,230
stop washing your fucking hands every
10 minutes you need to go see a doctor.

2484
02:16:14,231 --> 02:16:17,500
There's something crazy about that. And
you're right. You know what? Yeah, I do.

2485
02:16:17,580 --> 02:16:18,360
You like the,

2486
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:21,670
basically what you're saying is exactly
what happened and just opening up and

2487
02:16:21,671 --> 02:16:25,210
talking to a doctor about it. It's
like fucking fix it. You asshole.

2488
02:16:25,630 --> 02:16:28,300
Like you don't want to do this your whole
life. Like someone like Hyman again,

2489
02:16:28,301 --> 02:16:31,570
I don't know how met Adele,
but wouldn't that get in your,

2490
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:33,550
wouldn't that be annoying
when you want to get it fixed?

2491
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:34,051
Well,

2492
02:16:34,051 --> 02:16:37,830
I'm on the subs to the opposite end of
the spectrum cause I've done Jujitsu for

2493
02:16:37,831 --> 02:16:41,400
like 16 years.
Jujitsu is men sweating in your mouth.

2494
02:16:41,710 --> 02:16:45,300
You Girls Hassles. Well, I mean
I'm not averse to that either.

2495
02:16:45,301 --> 02:16:48,390
If the young ladies willing to
clean herself up. Right. But my,

2496
02:16:48,450 --> 02:16:53,400
my throne other subject. But you put your
OCD, you saw that is not healthy either.

2497
02:16:53,401 --> 02:16:55,230
I wonder how many people have
gotten sick from eating ass.

2498
02:16:55,520 --> 02:17:00,110
You eat raw horse meat, so that's
like, I'm way more chimpanzee than you.

2499
02:17:00,130 --> 02:17:02,430
My Body can digest that
horse meat without a problem.

2500
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:06,670
I very rarely get stomach aches.
Um, is that true? Yeah. Yeah. I,

2501
02:17:06,940 --> 02:17:10,390
I ate me. Yeah. I was in a restaurant.
They served us raw horse meat.

2502
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:12,800
I was going to say didn't enter the new,
the new thing.

2503
02:17:12,850 --> 02:17:15,610
Like apparently we're all eating
horse meat. No, no. That was a,

2504
02:17:15,630 --> 02:17:18,590
in the UK there was uh,
some food company got,

2505
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:20,320
it was like a Lasagna
or something like this.

2506
02:17:20,330 --> 02:17:23,550
Like he had kissed Swedish meatballs.
Yeah. And they had pushed me to them.

2507
02:17:24,030 --> 02:17:26,460
By the way. The horse meat.
Delicious. It's really good for you.

2508
02:17:26,640 --> 02:17:31,110
And people looked through [inaudible]
horse meat. Yes and no. I mean,

2509
02:17:31,111 --> 02:17:34,360
isn't it fucked up to eat a cow? Isn't
it fucked up to get a goat? Yeah.

2510
02:17:34,380 --> 02:17:36,660
I'm from Kentucky where they
take their horses very seriously,

2511
02:17:36,661 --> 02:17:39,760
but I wouldn't if I was hungry, you
know, what am I going to this one?

2512
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:43,560
Most people throughout history
have eaten horses. It's been,

2513
02:17:43,590 --> 02:17:46,400
it's been a guarantee.
Yeah.

2514
02:17:46,560 --> 02:17:49,710
I mean the Mongols eight,
their horses. I mean,

2515
02:17:49,711 --> 02:17:53,130
people have always eaten horses at
Ikea once, so I'm sure I should really

2516
02:17:55,240 --> 02:17:59,190
was the sweetest. I thought that was
in the UK. Wasn't that over there?

2517
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:01,680
I don't know. It might've been over
there, but I heard it was here too.

2518
02:18:01,681 --> 02:18:05,760
I think it was, well, they're
just starting to, um, I think
it was, there's an Amish,

2519
02:18:06,060 --> 02:18:11,060
a horse company company that deals with
the Amish where they're getting horses

2520
02:18:13,141 --> 02:18:14,130
in.
They're slaughtering them now,

2521
02:18:14,131 --> 02:18:17,700
like older horses and they're
slaughtering them for meat. And uh,

2522
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:20,340
the idea is they're doing it
through the Amish because the Amish,

2523
02:18:20,370 --> 02:18:23,910
they don't believe in the steroids or
any of the things that you would worry

2524
02:18:23,911 --> 02:18:27,150
about a horse having in its
body if you ate it. Yeah,

2525
02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:29,490
that'd be more people are fucking super,

2526
02:18:29,530 --> 02:18:33,030
you have a Pete do you have to pay
or something? I just look anxious.

2527
02:18:34,710 --> 02:18:37,710
People are super attached to
their horses though, man. I live,

2528
02:18:37,770 --> 02:18:41,790
I live near and this a question center
and I'm taking my daughter to go ride

2529
02:18:41,791 --> 02:18:45,750
around on horses and shit. And there's
a lot of people there that would like,

2530
02:18:45,751 --> 02:18:48,810
I mean if you told them that you were
going to serve people some horse meat,

2531
02:18:48,840 --> 02:18:50,240
they would,
they would fuck

2532
02:18:50,510 --> 02:18:54,560
freedive. I again, being from Kentucky,
I live friends who make their living,

2533
02:18:54,590 --> 02:18:57,890
you know, doing that kind of it so
I know where they're coming from.

2534
02:18:57,891 --> 02:18:59,000
Are you a horse person now?

2535
02:18:59,610 --> 02:19:02,640
No, not particularly. I mean, I
don't hate horses. I liked horses.

2536
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:04,650
I was never that interested in like,

2537
02:19:05,130 --> 02:19:09,120
I mean I think it's a fun way to travel,

2538
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:14,160
get on a horse and go on a trail. It's all
good. I like it, but it's not something,

2539
02:19:14,190 --> 02:19:15,420
I mean,
I could get into it.

2540
02:19:15,421 --> 02:19:18,240
I could see fallen in love with a horse
and taking it, you know, like, oh,

2541
02:19:18,241 --> 02:19:19,170
this is such a great horse.

2542
02:19:19,171 --> 02:19:22,500
I love having this horse and cleaned it
up and brush it and feed it and he'd be

2543
02:19:22,501 --> 02:19:26,550
your buddy. I could totally see that, but
I haven't had that personal experience.

2544
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:27,853
And I feel like

2545
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:31,040
at the end of the day that
the justification of eating
animals is pretty sketchy

2546
02:19:31,041 --> 02:19:31,874
at best anyway.

2547
02:19:32,270 --> 02:19:36,290
And then really we're just
fucking murdering all these
animals and eating them

2548
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:38,660
eyes.
It really matter if it's a horse or a cow

2549
02:19:38,950 --> 02:19:41,800
Vegan for one year for no
reason. I wasn't like, you know,

2550
02:19:41,801 --> 02:19:43,760
like an animal rights person
and I just like, I wanted to,

2551
02:19:43,770 --> 02:19:47,700
I wanted to see what I just, for some
reason it was kind of during my OCD,

2552
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:51,760
just like animals or like filthy and
Phillip Bacteria. So I stopped eating.

2553
02:19:52,210 --> 02:19:55,240
It's not healthy. I don't
like I was, I got really,

2554
02:19:55,241 --> 02:20:00,070
really thin and like really tired all
the time. Like I didn't do it correctly,

2555
02:20:00,071 --> 02:20:00,660
probably.

2556
02:20:00,660 --> 02:20:04,140
Well because of that I'm sure.
But there's also, there's,

2557
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:07,820
there's certain needs that we
have and one of them is, uh, the,

2558
02:20:07,930 --> 02:20:12,630
the function that cholesterol has and
brain function, you know, cholesterol,

2559
02:20:12,650 --> 02:20:16,680
like it's not all bad for you as a
matter of fact. And they do. The test

2560
02:20:17,100 --> 02:20:19,660
doctor gives you the test, he tells
you your good cholesterol in your bag.

2561
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:20,610
Yeah.

2562
02:20:20,610 --> 02:20:24,960
But the good cholesterol comes from
animal protein comes from fish.

2563
02:20:24,990 --> 02:20:28,770
I felt like shit, most of that time,
some of it's from plants you can get,

2564
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:31,230
you can balance it out if
you're really diligent.

2565
02:20:31,660 --> 02:20:35,500
Two are vegans who know how to do it
correctly, but it's a lot of work.

2566
02:20:35,910 --> 02:20:38,970
Yeah. Um, there's very few high
level athletes that have done it.

2567
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:42,240
That's what I was, I was gonna say
there's gotta be none. The only, I mean,

2568
02:20:42,241 --> 02:20:43,170
the only person I can think of,

2569
02:20:43,171 --> 02:20:47,450
well known didn't Clinton built in Bill
Clinton become vegan because it's hard

2570
02:20:47,490 --> 02:20:49,080
heart issues and he was about to die.

2571
02:20:49,380 --> 02:20:52,890
That fat fuck was just fucking eating
cheeseburgers constantly. Yeah.

2572
02:20:52,891 --> 02:20:57,891
Cholesterol plays a critical role in PR
and brain function and cholesterol comes

2573
02:20:58,381 --> 02:21:00,330
from animals.
I mean that's where it comes from.

2574
02:21:00,331 --> 02:21:04,300
I don't know of cholesterol was
even available in the, um, in,

2575
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:08,730
in the plant community. The plant
kingdom. Is it? I don't think so.

2576
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:11,700
You're asking the wrong guy. I think
cholesterol only comes from animals.

2577
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:14,250
I'm pretty sure I'm
cholesterol is a substance.

2578
02:21:14,251 --> 02:21:18,990
Genetically I'm painted as black by
the medical and scientific community.

2579
02:21:18,991 --> 02:21:22,560
But the fact remains that is a substance
that is innate to the body and forms a

2580
02:21:22,561 --> 02:21:26,040
critical part of, among
other things, key hormones,

2581
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:28,590
vitamin D and cell membranes.
It also,

2582
02:21:28,890 --> 02:21:33,000
it's also very concentrated in the brain
where it contributes to the functioning

2583
02:21:33,001 --> 02:21:34,140
of synapses,

2584
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:38,100
tiny gaps between the cells which allow
the nerves to communicate with each

2585
02:21:38,101 --> 02:21:41,250
other. That's one of the things
that we had with um, um, uh,

2586
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:45,300
Dave Asprey talked about this
and uh, Rob Wolf from, uh,

2587
02:21:45,570 --> 02:21:50,370
Rob Wolf who's a primal diet
advocate. He's a advocate of the, uh,

2588
02:21:51,530 --> 02:21:56,180
um, well it's uh, his, his
whole, I, it's all the um,

2589
02:21:56,310 --> 02:22:01,170
uh, Paleo. The idea. Yeah. Look, there's,

2590
02:22:01,230 --> 02:22:05,610
there's a lot of logic behind Paleo
diets when it comes to the human body not

2591
02:22:05,611 --> 02:22:07,230
being designed to consume wheat,

2592
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:12,440
not beings designed to eat pastas
and designed to eat lean grass,

2593
02:22:12,511 --> 02:22:15,340
fed protein and vegetables.
Like, that's really what,

2594
02:22:16,400 --> 02:22:18,180
what's the date where you can,
it's all has to be the stuff.

2595
02:22:18,181 --> 02:22:20,430
Stuff that you eat with. Use your hands
to eat. Is that what I'm thinking?

2596
02:22:20,630 --> 02:22:24,530
No. Paleo. You can use forks.
Yeah, but they're so funny, man.

2597
02:22:24,531 --> 02:22:26,010
He lends itself some new die.
It's like

2598
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:29,070
the caveman diet where you, it's the only
things you can eat. The caveman would,

2599
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:31,800
he's probably an idiot.
I didn't say he wasn't an idiot.

2600
02:22:31,830 --> 02:22:36,440
No reason to not use a fork. The forks or
so on nutritious, I think. I think he's,

2601
02:22:36,510 --> 02:22:38,520
I think he was like the idea of anything.

2602
02:22:38,521 --> 02:22:41,550
Like you only eat stuff
that cavemen woody. Oh yeah.

2603
02:22:41,551 --> 02:22:43,780
Well I think you're misreading
what he's saying. That's Paleo.

2604
02:22:43,781 --> 02:22:47,280
That's fairly Olympic error. That's crazy,
man. I'm thinking about the right thing.

2605
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:51,420
I just, I just said it incorrectly. Well,
no, this is not about utensils is what

2606
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:56,010
he's using that as a way to
explain it to me. Oh, okay. I see.

2607
02:22:56,220 --> 02:22:57,090
Because I don't understand things,

2608
02:22:57,091 --> 02:23:01,020
but the idea is that genetically we're
not much different from the people that

2609
02:23:01,021 --> 02:23:04,740
live 40 50,000 years ago. In fact,
we're probably exactly the same.

2610
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:07,620
You could take a guy from 50,000
years ago was a Homosapien,

2611
02:23:07,621 --> 02:23:10,920
dress him up in clothes and stick them
in a movie theater and before the movie

2612
02:23:10,921 --> 02:23:13,200
starts, you wouldn't even be able
to figure out who the caveman is.

2613
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:16,470
It's just once the movie begins and he
starts fucking screaming and running out

2614
02:23:16,471 --> 02:23:19,180
of the room, then you know that's
the case. But depending on the movie,

2615
02:23:19,181 --> 02:23:22,500
you might be me. Yeah. You
think that's screaming and yeah.

2616
02:23:22,620 --> 02:23:25,740
More than a caveman who's never seen
a movie before. Yeah. If I write,

2617
02:23:25,770 --> 02:23:29,130
what would be the one movie that
would make you scream like Les Miz?

2618
02:23:29,131 --> 02:23:32,040
Probably Miss. Yeah. I don't know.
I saw that lame ass thing. I'm like,

2619
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:36,900
if I had to choose between Kona jail
where nobody talked to me for 24 hours or

2620
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:40,650
watching Les Ms for 24 hours straight.
I think you did cite it.

2621
02:23:40,660 --> 02:23:44,370
So take solitary for a day. How was
it? I have a thing. I don't know.

2622
02:23:44,371 --> 02:23:46,830
I have no idea. There's no way
I'm going to see that. Okay.

2623
02:23:46,860 --> 02:23:48,150
Now I want to see a movie.

2624
02:23:48,151 --> 02:23:51,240
About a bunch of people crying that
lived in the day where there was no TV or

2625
02:23:51,241 --> 02:23:55,540
internet and they were all fucking singing
everything and crying. I was draining.

2626
02:23:56,030 --> 02:23:58,910
A friend told me that it was so bad that
you should maybe see it then. I'm like,

2627
02:23:59,510 --> 02:24:02,700
but I'm, I'm, I don't know about you
guys. I'm not one of those guys who likes,

2628
02:24:03,090 --> 02:24:05,220
I don't get enjoyment out of things
that are so bad. They're good.

2629
02:24:05,221 --> 02:24:09,260
That's not fun for me. I do out
of some things like, um, the,

2630
02:24:09,430 --> 02:24:11,340
do you ever see the day after tomorrow?
No.

2631
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:14,920
It's that really bad movie
about global warming where a,

2632
02:24:14,940 --> 02:24:19,680
it becomes like this crazy snow storm
that covers north America and everybody

2633
02:24:19,681 --> 02:24:23,670
dies except Dennis Quaid who
goes camping. Uh, he's outside.

2634
02:24:23,671 --> 02:24:25,410
It's fucking a hundred
million degrees below zero.

2635
02:24:25,411 --> 02:24:30,000
He's got a 10 east fines sipping coffee
and shit. It's like, get over here guys.

2636
02:24:30,030 --> 02:24:33,360
That's his voice through the whole movie.
Weird voice.

2637
02:24:33,361 --> 02:24:36,510
Like it sounded like a
South Park character and I
thought talking about watch

2638
02:24:36,511 --> 02:24:40,050
that movie and think of South Park
and top sounds so much like a self.

2639
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:42,930
Totally making something. I'll pull
up. Pull up a scene. All right.

2640
02:24:43,020 --> 02:24:46,080
Hold up a scene desk. Wait, you just
totally made that up. Oh yes. Yeah.

2641
02:24:46,081 --> 02:24:46,591
First of all,

2642
02:24:46,591 --> 02:24:50,830
he's a fine actor and you are disparaging
that man's name and reputation. Uh,

2643
02:24:50,850 --> 02:24:54,360
the day after tomorrow, Sky's
got insurance. You can't
disparage his name. Yeah,

2644
02:24:54,361 --> 02:24:57,160
you can't do that, bro. I have a
fucking podcast look out for it.

2645
02:24:57,170 --> 02:25:00,120
Can't just be making shit up.
I just think, shut up man.

2646
02:25:00,121 --> 02:25:02,460
Stop it with the gay voice.
Stop at Gay Voice. Listen,

2647
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:05,880
Paris Hilton is already mad at me
or the other one that Perez Hilton,

2648
02:25:06,810 --> 02:25:09,290
one of those guys, check this out and
tell me if this does not sound like a,

2649
02:25:09,390 --> 02:25:11,070
like somebody from South Park's is doing.

2650
02:25:11,071 --> 02:25:14,570
Dennis Quaid voice is better not be a
parody site. You took me til you fuck.

2651
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:15,473
Got It.

2652
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:21,330
Century Fox presents 10,000 years ago,

2653
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:25,013
one store

2654
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:29,830
change the face of our planet.

2655
02:25:31,690 --> 02:25:35,560
That is true this year. Maybe not a
store. Maybe it's an asteroid impact.

2656
02:25:35,930 --> 02:25:36,763
It's pretty short.

2657
02:25:39,860 --> 02:25:40,770
You see is

2658
02:25:45,650 --> 02:25:47,330
JPL was battered by the loggers?

2659
02:26:02,930 --> 02:26:03,763
Yeah.

2660
02:26:11,330 --> 02:26:13,640
If you're listening to this at home,

2661
02:26:14,450 --> 02:26:17,000
this is not nearly as interesting
as watching. What can we do

2662
02:26:19,140 --> 02:26:22,730
there? Go. The safer they'll be
DT for him to suggest this plan.

2663
02:26:22,780 --> 02:26:25,460
What's happening here in Washington.
His son is a Manhattan.

2664
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:32,450
I'm the director of still,
so that's it.

2665
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:36,530
That's his voice. What should we do? I
will come for you. Do you understand me?

2666
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:39,270
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

2667
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:42,273
Shut it off.

2668
02:26:45,340 --> 02:26:49,630
He made things up again. Turn it back
on. You may turn my voice on you made it,

2669
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:51,760
made it up again. You're fucked.
There's nothing wrong with that guys.

2670
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:56,690
I will shut the fuck I'm for you
not to go with Joe Rogan on this.

2671
02:26:57,050 --> 02:27:01,250
Just wasted our time. I'm just
saying that my opinion, Dennis Quaid,

2672
02:27:01,251 --> 02:27:04,250
his voice sounds like he sounds like
Trey Parker. That's what I'm saying.

2673
02:27:04,510 --> 02:27:05,280
That's all I'm saying.

2674
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:09,020
You just take it to that level and for
some reason you are absolutely incorrect.

2675
02:27:09,050 --> 02:27:13,580
He does not sound like treat you with
that. That's my opinion. Oh my God, Brian,

2676
02:27:13,581 --> 02:27:16,930
we all heard, hey, if he sounded
totally normal, you're like, hi guy.

2677
02:27:16,931 --> 02:27:21,110
If that is not what he sounded like and
we, we, we, we listened to one sentence.

2678
02:27:21,111 --> 02:27:25,580
By the way, if you don't put
on some headphones and you
play it and you find me a

2679
02:27:25,581 --> 02:27:29,000
representative of what the fuck you
were saying and if it's not true,

2680
02:27:29,210 --> 02:27:32,990
we're going to hold you down.
True thing. I'm just saying,

2681
02:27:32,991 --> 02:27:35,450
I think Dennis Quaid his voice sounds
like Trey Parker doing south park.

2682
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:38,210
That's all I'm saying. I'm saying
you might have brain damage. No,

2683
02:27:39,210 --> 02:27:40,130
I agree with me on that.
Yeah,

2684
02:27:40,140 --> 02:27:44,790
that'd be a mediator on this three or four
crazy fucks out there going, yeah. Bam.

2685
02:27:44,900 --> 02:27:46,100
I'm on your thigh.

2686
02:27:46,310 --> 02:27:50,840
Your persecuted on I show you're totally
correct in your assumption that he

2687
02:27:50,850 --> 02:27:55,040
throws like pre park and you said
when you do you sell just like,

2688
02:27:55,041 --> 02:27:56,600
don't you sound like Dennis Coy?
You just know

2689
02:27:57,590 --> 02:28:02,420
like what I wanted to sound like the,
but that's a good,

2690
02:28:02,510 --> 02:28:06,950
uh, a good example of a movie
that's so bad that it becomes funny.

2691
02:28:07,460 --> 02:28:09,980
See, I haven't seen it all now after
seeing that Promo, I do one on one.

2692
02:28:09,981 --> 02:28:13,130
Have you ever seen either you show
girls? Yeah, that's a good, that's,

2693
02:28:13,390 --> 02:28:16,160
that's an example of a good movie.
That's fine. Have you seen the room?

2694
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:20,240
What is the room? You don't know? You guys
know about the rule. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah.

2695
02:28:20,241 --> 02:28:22,010
I have that.
Have that on video.

2696
02:28:22,220 --> 02:28:25,640
It's made me buy it. It's the
best. It's hilarious. It's so bad.

2697
02:28:25,641 --> 02:28:26,660
I can't get through it though.

2698
02:28:26,920 --> 02:28:29,170
It's tough. But I, in the
theaters it's, it's almost like,

2699
02:28:29,710 --> 02:28:32,110
I never saw a rocky horror picture show
or anything like that in the theaters.

2700
02:28:32,111 --> 02:28:33,520
But this is like,
you go there.

2701
02:28:33,880 --> 02:28:35,730
I think the theater's gone
actually where they use to be.

2702
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:37,370
Well,
the one in sunset or it's there.

2703
02:28:37,371 --> 02:28:39,440
It's now it's different
theaters or something. Yeah.

2704
02:28:39,441 --> 02:28:42,080
For folks who don't know what
we're talking about, the room,

2705
02:28:42,350 --> 02:28:46,000
there was a billboard on La
Cienega. No, no, on the brayer.

2706
02:28:46,310 --> 02:28:49,910
And the billboard was up for years.
That was the room, the movie,

2707
02:28:49,911 --> 02:28:52,310
and it was this guy's face,
Tommy Wiseau,

2708
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:56,390
who's this weird looking dude who
looks like like a monster or something.

2709
02:28:56,391 --> 02:29:00,680
It looks like strange and it gets
naked in the film. Well in the movie,

2710
02:29:00,681 --> 02:29:03,470
he like gets to fuck all the girls
and he's like the star of the movie.

2711
02:29:03,471 --> 02:29:05,140
He wrote the movie for himself,
apparently

2712
02:29:05,320 --> 02:29:10,210
paid for it all apparently.
And he uh, um, yeah,

2713
02:29:10,211 --> 02:29:13,420
paid for the whole thing.
It was what happened.

2714
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:15,760
Here's the story I was
told was that he put it,

2715
02:29:15,761 --> 02:29:19,450
he put it in all these film festivals
and some stone kid at Ucla went to like

2716
02:29:19,451 --> 02:29:23,260
the UCLA film festival by himself and
just walked into this film and he comes

2717
02:29:23,261 --> 02:29:26,860
back to his dorm room. He
goes, Dude's, I'm not positive,

2718
02:29:26,861 --> 02:29:28,770
but I think I just saw the
best film ever made it.

2719
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:30,550
Will you guys come back to tonight?

2720
02:29:30,551 --> 02:29:32,980
They're playing it again and like went
back to the 10 friends and they all

2721
02:29:32,981 --> 02:29:36,040
thought it was fucking, that's
the ad. Is that ad still up?

2722
02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:40,750
But he paid to have it, uh,
you know, to put it, it was,

2723
02:29:40,900 --> 02:29:43,840
he paid the money to make it
in competition for the Oscars.

2724
02:29:44,170 --> 02:29:46,240
The unit costs a lot of money
to like make your movie.

2725
02:29:46,540 --> 02:29:50,610
Did he try to get nominated?
And it is. I remember, uh,

2726
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:54,100
but I used to go to the screenings when
they had like a few years ago and it was

2727
02:29:54,101 --> 02:29:54,551
a funny thing.

2728
02:29:54,551 --> 02:29:57,250
He would do Q and A's before he would
go to every screening and while people

2729
02:29:57,251 --> 02:30:00,370
laughed at his film and he would
go do a Q and a beforehand,

2730
02:30:00,371 --> 02:30:03,290
I remember one guy goes,
they would make up questions secret,

2731
02:30:03,370 --> 02:30:06,460
see what kind of crazy answers he
would come with. And this guy goes,

2732
02:30:06,910 --> 02:30:09,580
is it true that your film
was funded by Nazi gold?

2733
02:30:10,030 --> 02:30:14,920
And it's so crazy the guy he was, and
he goes, he gets goes, no comment.

2734
02:30:16,420 --> 02:30:21,310
Wow. Like he like, you're supposed
to say no dude. Yeah. Like he did.

2735
02:30:21,370 --> 02:30:23,140
Obviously the answer's no,
but he just doesn't,

2736
02:30:23,180 --> 02:30:24,220
I don't really understand the question

2737
02:30:24,290 --> 02:30:27,510
is that he doesn't understand it or is it,
he's just so fucking stupid.

2738
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:29,520
He's so dumb and then a play cool.

2739
02:30:29,610 --> 02:30:32,250
Cause I, uh, I, uh, I went there for my,

2740
02:30:32,310 --> 02:30:36,780
with my friends for my birthday and he
signed my poster, don't, happy birthday.

2741
02:30:36,781 --> 02:30:40,050
Ben and I was walking, I went to the
bathroom with the poster man. He goes,

2742
02:30:40,620 --> 02:30:43,290
you want me to tell? I'll do
graph for your poster. I'm like,

2743
02:30:43,560 --> 02:30:46,590
you just did five minutes ago.
He's like, I'll all right.

2744
02:30:46,620 --> 02:30:47,780
And he picks it out and you autographs.

2745
02:30:47,850 --> 02:30:49,560
I have a poster of him
with the autograph twice.

2746
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:51,520
Wow.
So there's something wrong with them.

2747
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:55,080
There's something really wrong,
but he's got a lot of money and his money.

2748
02:30:55,620 --> 02:30:59,610
That's the thing. No one
knows. Hmm. Not, not. Well,

2749
02:30:59,611 --> 02:31:01,020
it could be not to go if we don't know.
He didn't.

2750
02:31:01,190 --> 02:31:03,530
Whoa. So maybe he's on
your vampire or something.

2751
02:31:04,290 --> 02:31:05,160
It had had the vamp,

2752
02:31:05,190 --> 02:31:09,000
like people are trying to find pictures
of him in the daylight because people

2753
02:31:09,001 --> 02:31:09,834
claim he's available.

2754
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:13,630
Well, he looks like a vampire that's got
a very, your empire. Look at the movie.

2755
02:31:13,631 --> 02:31:17,230
The, the poster rather the, the room.
The movie. When I was on the road,

2756
02:31:17,231 --> 02:31:20,040
I thought it was a horror movie.
It looks like a horse because he's

2757
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:23,010
brooding is his hair is long.
He looks like Chris Gaines.

2758
02:31:23,220 --> 02:31:28,080
He claimed his gains if he was, yeah,
he was the whole time. Garth Brooks,

2759
02:31:28,090 --> 02:31:31,680
his new role that I think a fucked up
when I told them it was Garth Brooks,

2760
02:31:32,070 --> 02:31:36,420
if I just make movies as this new dude,
I'm telling you man,

2761
02:31:36,930 --> 02:31:40,230
we didn't,
they remake and Moody sometimes it didn't.

2762
02:31:40,231 --> 02:31:42,840
They remake the trailers of the
room and turn it into like a comedy.

2763
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:44,910
You wouldn't be found out. People
were laughing. They made it.

2764
02:31:45,230 --> 02:31:49,350
Apparently he tried to pretend that he
meant to do everything wrong with the

2765
02:31:49,351 --> 02:31:53,340
room and eight minutes or less spoilers.
The Oh, awesome. This is great.

2766
02:31:53,550 --> 02:31:58,250
Written by Tommy was and the
Holy Ghost look the weird. Okay.

2767
02:31:58,260 --> 02:32:02,880
He comes in and there's a really
hot girl this time Tommy said yes.

2768
02:32:05,190 --> 02:32:07,160
Hi Doug. Hi Babe. Oh Hi mark.

2769
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:11,560
Hi to everyone.

2770
02:32:13,190 --> 02:32:18,150
He's got this weird look too. Guys
got long, obviously dyed black

2771
02:32:18,220 --> 02:32:23,220
care and he looks like he's probably in
his like late forties but like really

2772
02:32:24,281 --> 02:32:27,260
like a harsh features. But he's
playing like a 23 year olds. Yeah,

2773
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:30,730
but he's playing like this stud and so
he hooks up with all these girls in this

2774
02:32:30,731 --> 02:32:32,290
movie.
So he's always like banging.

2775
02:32:32,560 --> 02:32:34,770
He's like banging left and
right and this movie, Oh,

2776
02:32:34,771 --> 02:32:37,480
I love this song from laying down
the soundtrack. The record skipped.

2777
02:32:40,060 --> 02:32:42,550
The flower shop owner doesn't know
what's Johnny even though no one on the

2778
02:32:42,551 --> 02:32:45,070
entire earth looks like Johnny,
you're my favorite custom.

2779
02:32:45,071 --> 02:32:47,910
So what was up with not recognizing me?
You're my favorite cup.

2780
02:32:48,590 --> 02:32:52,410
That wholly at Denny is a creepy
bastard. It's just kidding. Holy Shit.

2781
02:32:52,430 --> 02:32:54,790
Denny is a grumpy bastard.
Tawny was El reads lines.

2782
02:32:54,791 --> 02:32:57,730
He wrote like he doesn't understand them.
Think I will ever get it.

2783
02:32:58,300 --> 02:33:00,580
They betray me,
but they didn't keep their promise.

2784
02:33:00,630 --> 02:33:02,350
They tricked me and I don't care anymore.

2785
02:33:02,830 --> 02:33:05,940
The best way to be someone who doesn't
drink is a combination of scotch or vodka.

2786
02:33:07,230 --> 02:33:11,710
Scott's in fact, that was
his drinking scotch. Scotch.

2787
02:33:13,450 --> 02:33:14,980
Scotch gun is not your mother's cooking.

2788
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:19,270
You do not need to lie about
Scotchgard at some. No cane, no cane.

2789
02:33:20,650 --> 02:33:24,670
Yeah, it is a weird, I recommend that
movie to everyone. It's the fucking best.

2790
02:33:24,730 --> 02:33:26,200
As someone who doesn't
like that kind of stuff,

2791
02:33:26,540 --> 02:33:29,190
they had screenings all the time
still I guess. Where are they now?

2792
02:33:29,980 --> 02:33:33,160
I began invited all the time and I
think maybe the silent movie theater or

2793
02:33:33,161 --> 02:33:34,770
somewhere like that.
That's probably where it is.

2794
02:33:34,771 --> 02:33:38,230
It cause it was at that sunset five and
now that's like Robert Redford theater.

2795
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:40,720
Yeah, it seems like it would
be a good thing to go to get,

2796
02:33:40,721 --> 02:33:44,290
get a little drunk and go with a
bunch of friends. It is. It's fine.

2797
02:33:44,920 --> 02:33:48,670
Until that theater closed, they would
have like four room. No, no point.

2798
02:33:48,671 --> 02:33:52,150
You're like four different screens going
on at once and pack the place for the

2799
02:33:52,151 --> 02:33:55,300
room and people and the,
and he would be there.

2800
02:33:55,330 --> 02:33:58,090
Why people are laughing at
his moody. It's crazy. Wow.

2801
02:33:58,091 --> 02:34:02,320
Well I guess for a guy like that he
must be so torn because it's obviously

2802
02:34:02,321 --> 02:34:04,230
getting a lot of a tank,
getting his money. Man,

2803
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:08,160
he's getting his money back and he's
becoming famous yet I feel like it's fee.

2804
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:09,130
Don't you feel like it's famous?

2805
02:34:09,131 --> 02:34:11,320
It's like died down that
like it's Kinda old news.

2806
02:34:11,380 --> 02:34:14,350
Maybe he'll come back again because he
was telling people he's doing a new movie

2807
02:34:14,351 --> 02:34:18,070
with De Niro, which is
obviously made up, but I haven't

2808
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:18,903
heard what he's up to

2809
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:21,640
as always. You never know. Man.
Deniro has been doing some fucking,

2810
02:34:22,170 --> 02:34:24,880
I think he's doing movies lately.
I don't know.

2811
02:34:24,881 --> 02:34:28,630
That's that one that he did with with
Sharon Stone where he's a wizard or

2812
02:34:28,631 --> 02:34:33,400
something like that. No, it was,
that was that movie pull up the,

2813
02:34:33,620 --> 02:34:35,440
the, the photo. Just the,

2814
02:34:35,620 --> 02:34:39,550
he's done some fucking
clearly gets paid movies.

2815
02:34:39,630 --> 02:34:42,000
I guess the DVD of the
room that they did that,

2816
02:34:42,090 --> 02:34:45,180
the commentary that director's
commentaries gold really.

2817
02:34:45,181 --> 02:34:47,910
I can only imagine.

2818
02:34:48,030 --> 02:34:51,500
I'm sure talking about his
motivation and each individual scene,

2819
02:34:52,390 --> 02:34:56,610
someone posted online to the
auditions for this, for the movie,

2820
02:34:57,930 --> 02:35:02,070
which I can't watch. Well, one of
the things about moving to Hollywood,

2821
02:35:02,490 --> 02:35:06,780
I moved here in [inaudible] 94 I had
no experience whatsoever with actors.

2822
02:35:06,781 --> 02:35:07,680
I didn't know any.

2823
02:35:07,860 --> 02:35:12,210
I knew comics who a lot of people will
say that comics are a lot like actors

2824
02:35:12,211 --> 02:35:14,880
because they're very needy and
they're very self centered,

2825
02:35:14,881 --> 02:35:17,730
but I don't find that to be true.

2826
02:35:18,030 --> 02:35:21,750
I think the really good comics especially,
they're really interesting people.

2827
02:35:21,751 --> 02:35:24,810
They're fun to hang out with and talk to,
but actors,

2828
02:35:25,140 --> 02:35:30,140
I've met some actors that
were so bizarrely self
centered and so bizarrely like

2829
02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:36,500
unaware of how a normal person would look
at them and how they behave that this

2830
02:35:36,691 --> 02:35:39,480
kind of the room movie
thing makes sense to me.

2831
02:35:39,660 --> 02:35:41,860
If you didn't live here and
didn't know these people, right?

2832
02:35:41,930 --> 02:35:45,590
Real life we have you say that. I wonder
if you were not in La, if, if he would,

2833
02:35:46,100 --> 02:35:46,850
it would be.

2834
02:35:46,850 --> 02:35:51,850
It's funny you're laughing at it because
it's because you live in Hollywood and

2835
02:35:52,401 --> 02:35:57,040
this is worst representative of that
guy. Know that guy. Totally. Yeah,

2836
02:35:57,200 --> 02:36:00,140
and it's probably a piece of me and
that guy, a very small piece, but still,

2837
02:36:00,141 --> 02:36:03,560
you know, like I would, I've sure I've
auditioned for shit worse than that.

2838
02:36:03,590 --> 02:36:05,950
I'm actually not worse than that.
But you know of a district or some shit

2839
02:36:06,370 --> 02:36:10,930
met people that were completely crazy
that were making their own movies and

2840
02:36:10,931 --> 02:36:13,030
coming up to you with the,
I know object or trying to do,

2841
02:36:13,290 --> 02:36:16,650
I know a lot of people still, Mike,
if you ever seen when he said heat,

2842
02:36:16,870 --> 02:36:19,070
it's just going to say the same thing.
Reminds me of windy city.

2843
02:36:19,560 --> 02:36:23,040
What the fuck is funnier than windy
city? What's funnier? Well that guy,

2844
02:36:23,041 --> 02:36:24,420
the problem with when he said he is,
I know

2845
02:36:24,650 --> 02:36:27,260
God that guy is always around.
He was always around the common story.

2846
02:36:27,261 --> 02:36:30,020
That guy was annoying as fuck.
And they're like,

2847
02:36:30,021 --> 02:36:34,280
they sort of legitimized him in
a way and gave him some juice.

2848
02:36:34,740 --> 02:36:37,650
I do it cause I just did, again,
not to brag, but I was, I did,

2849
02:36:37,990 --> 02:36:41,420
I did Kimmel last week. And so
like all the writers, you know, he,

2850
02:36:41,421 --> 02:36:45,520
he produced that film and uh, so all the
writers and producers and stuff or like,

2851
02:36:46,060 --> 02:36:47,980
you know,
there'll be nice to me and I'm just like,

2852
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:52,030
it sells Saul Steinberg would screen,
but you know, I'm like, you know, uncles,

2853
02:36:52,510 --> 02:36:56,050
cousin sal, like I know him from
windy city heat, right? Like mole.

2854
02:36:56,051 --> 02:36:59,110
I know him from the movie and stuff as
opposed to like their jobs on Kimmel.

2855
02:36:59,580 --> 02:37:02,110
I've watched 20 city heat.
So many folks have done a new one.

2856
02:37:02,350 --> 02:37:06,460
I keep praying about it. Uh, they
filmed the, about five years ago,

2857
02:37:06,461 --> 02:37:09,850
they filmed the beginning part and like
I like, I like that just to try it out,

2858
02:37:09,880 --> 02:37:10,241
you know,

2859
02:37:10,241 --> 02:37:13,960
like the idea of Johnny Knoxville was
supposed to Jackson by her as scary.

2860
02:37:13,961 --> 02:37:15,980
Perry and I actually got to
sit and the filming and I

2861
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:20,090
sat next to Jimmy Kimmel watching this
and it was beautiful. And then scary.

2862
02:37:20,091 --> 02:37:24,590
Perry comes in and goes, I'm scary Perry,
you know, and stuff, and I don't know,

2863
02:37:24,620 --> 02:37:28,430
whatever happened happened to it because
they also made a Ding Dong show movie

2864
02:37:28,431 --> 02:37:30,910
that immediately got shelved.
For some reason,

2865
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:32,650
only a few people saw it and
I heard it was [inaudible].

2866
02:37:32,930 --> 02:37:36,890
Oh, there's a windy city heat pog big
three podcasts. It's really funny,

2867
02:37:36,891 --> 02:37:38,320
but I don't listen to movie.

2868
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:41,600
The problem that Ding Dong movie would
be that I guarantee the people in the

2869
02:37:41,601 --> 02:37:46,130
Ding dog movie probably protested them,
put it in the movie, mocked like that.

2870
02:37:46,190 --> 02:37:49,520
Yeah. If you never heard of the Ding Dong
show, Don Barris, who's a buddy of ours,

2871
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:53,390
does it show at the comedy store on a
regular basis where he brings the worst

2872
02:37:53,391 --> 02:37:58,010
acts known to man, like this Guy
Peter Chin and these like terrible,

2873
02:37:58,011 --> 02:38:00,680
terrible comedians. And they saw a
big three from what he said, he him,

2874
02:38:00,890 --> 02:38:01,910
and he's always been doing this.

2875
02:38:02,060 --> 02:38:05,290
Don's been doing this almost like there's
this constant running art projects

2876
02:38:05,291 --> 02:38:08,060
since the beginning of time,
since as long as I've known him,

2877
02:38:08,210 --> 02:38:10,080
he's had these shows there
where he would do these,

2878
02:38:10,110 --> 02:38:14,780
these ding dongs shows where he just has
these unbelievably bad comedians and he

2879
02:38:14,781 --> 02:38:18,900
treats them like they're artists and
you know that go up. I know, I see.

2880
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:22,850
I still haven't seen it a lot, but we
did the podcast at death squad. Yeah,

2881
02:38:22,851 --> 02:38:25,640
he does. Uh, how many, if
he's done, how many so far?

2882
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:29,870
We just finished our 13th I'll listen to
that. Yeah, he's a great guy too. He's a,

2883
02:38:30,170 --> 02:38:33,890
and he's in when he said he hate to write.
Yup. He's, he's one of the big three.

2884
02:38:33,891 --> 02:38:36,740
He's a star. Dawn Buress is
awesome. He's a great guy too.

2885
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:40,760
He's like one of those guys
that like, he's like, to me,

2886
02:38:40,761 --> 02:38:43,520
he's like a hidden treasure in the
world of entertainment. I was like,

2887
02:38:43,521 --> 02:38:45,460
how do I fuck the more people
not know about Don Baer?

2888
02:38:45,550 --> 02:38:48,010
Yeah. I mean, I mean watching
him every night, it's,

2889
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:52,190
it's amazing that he does what he
does every single fucking night. Yeah,

2890
02:38:52,210 --> 02:38:55,630
he does that and I mean he's
there every night, three units,

2891
02:38:55,700 --> 02:38:58,990
Kimmel and then he goes straight there
and he's there every morning till three

2892
02:38:58,991 --> 02:39:02,440
in the morning. Just like entertaining.
Like sometimes two people in the audience.

2893
02:39:02,750 --> 02:39:04,650
Once I was the youngest people
in the parking lot. Yeah,

2894
02:39:05,210 --> 02:39:09,020
he'll do a set in the parking lot. He's
hilarious and he's a great guy. He just,

2895
02:39:09,230 --> 02:39:11,690
for whatever reason, the world
hasn't found his place yet. But no,

2896
02:39:11,700 --> 02:39:13,730
I like when he said he,
he is different than the room.

2897
02:39:13,731 --> 02:39:17,030
I'll show that to friends like back in
Kentucky and there'll be cracking up and

2898
02:39:17,031 --> 02:39:20,720
they give it to their friend. Have you
seen showgirls? Showgirls, right house,

2899
02:39:20,930 --> 02:39:24,010
but where do you said he to legitimately
good move. Yeah. Yeah. Well when the city,

2900
02:39:24,011 --> 02:39:27,950
he was good on purpose. Yes,
exactly. Whereas showgirls
and Roadhouse, we're like,

2901
02:39:28,010 --> 02:39:30,500
showgirls is probably the best
example of what we were talking.

2902
02:39:30,501 --> 02:39:33,170
Roadhouse is the best example
of a cocaine movie. Well,

2903
02:39:33,171 --> 02:39:35,170
you know that they were on coke
when they were making that movie.

2904
02:39:35,200 --> 02:39:38,060
Like there's no other way you could think
this was good. You got to be cooked. I,

2905
02:39:38,061 --> 02:39:41,600
I'll go, oh yeah, fuck yeah.
Tell him paint don't hurt pain.

2906
02:39:41,601 --> 02:39:46,400
Don't hurt most of the eighties movies,
showgirls to showgirls, breach of coke.

2907
02:39:46,790 --> 02:39:48,460
Certainly in the writing.
Yeah.

2908
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:51,650
Well in the performance to
the whole thing is just chaos.

2909
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:53,900
It's just like you thought this was what?

2910
02:39:54,350 --> 02:39:57,740
And he took the girl from saved by the
bell and what and how come? No Way.

2911
02:39:57,741 --> 02:40:00,510
We've talked her into doing some squats
before this movie. Exactly. Bullet,

2912
02:40:00,550 --> 02:40:04,280
but what? Well, how much did it, how
much of a, it was a horrible bomb, right?

2913
02:40:04,400 --> 02:40:06,380
Oh yeah.
Well I think it made money though.

2914
02:40:06,530 --> 02:40:10,370
It had to have so many people over time
that those special additions now where

2915
02:40:10,371 --> 02:40:13,880
you can buy it with like the comes with
like the stripper stuff and all this

2916
02:40:13,910 --> 02:40:14,190
scene

2917
02:40:14,190 --> 02:40:18,360
where the fuck was she fucks that
guy from, what was that? That uh,

2918
02:40:18,770 --> 02:40:21,870
what was that show? Blue Velvet.
Was that Mclaughlin? Yeah, that guy.

2919
02:40:21,990 --> 02:40:25,770
Remember she fucks him in the pool. Holy.
It's the most ridiculous thing ever.

2920
02:40:25,890 --> 02:40:28,950
She starts flopping around and slapping
the water like a fish while he's banging

2921
02:40:28,951 --> 02:40:30,300
her and he's just like,
yeah,

2922
02:40:32,600 --> 02:40:35,520
it's a long way down from blue velvet
and you're like, what are you doing?

2923
02:40:35,521 --> 02:40:39,210
No one fucks like that. Stop
this. This doesn't make any sense,

2924
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:44,700
but in the movie it totally
made sense. The water, she's
wild. She's unpredictable.

2925
02:40:46,540 --> 02:40:51,450
God getting my trailer suck my cock.
We'll get it.

2926
02:40:51,451 --> 02:40:52,284
Heart,
get it hard.

2927
02:40:52,590 --> 02:40:55,350
We got to film this fucking movement and
finish this movie so you could suck my

2928
02:40:55,351 --> 02:40:56,880
cock more. All right. Actually I'm

2929
02:40:58,440 --> 02:41:02,550
fucking chaotic. Crazy movie.
Have you seen grizzly man?

2930
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:07,210
Yes. I would say it's better
than showgirls. Yes, it might.

2931
02:41:07,900 --> 02:41:12,150
Maybe the greatest movie ever made. It
is a great movie as far as documentaries.

2932
02:41:12,690 --> 02:41:15,630
When I recommend to people if they say,
if you recommend a documentary,

2933
02:41:15,631 --> 02:41:16,464
I say grizzly man.

2934
02:41:16,590 --> 02:41:20,940
It's weird because mine would be the one
I said before is the staircase and that

2935
02:41:20,941 --> 02:41:24,210
you got to see that when bums me out,
man. No, you'll love it. You'll love it.

2936
02:41:25,170 --> 02:41:27,810
I'm trying to think. But yeah, I spent
most of my, if I'm going to watch a movie,

2937
02:41:27,811 --> 02:41:29,820
I'll watch a documentary
way before any kind of,

2938
02:41:30,510 --> 02:41:32,100
that's all I watched his documentaries.
Yeah,

2939
02:41:32,101 --> 02:41:34,520
I've been watching quite a
few of them lately. There's a,

2940
02:41:34,600 --> 02:41:36,840
this is a good time for documentaries.
I love that.

2941
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:41,950
I have the apple iTunes or whatever the
fuck it is. What's the TV? Apple TV.

2942
02:41:41,951 --> 02:41:43,840
Apple TV.
And um,

2943
02:41:43,980 --> 02:41:47,190
you go to the documentary section and
it's just documentary documentary.

2944
02:41:48,020 --> 02:41:51,930
I saw this really good. Uh, Dave
Grohl made this sound city movie.

2945
02:41:53,450 --> 02:41:57,150
I didn't watch it yet. It was really cool.
He got the thumbs up over here. It was,

2946
02:41:57,180 --> 02:42:01,910
it was great man. It was like the, the,
the story of this, uh, recording studio.

2947
02:42:02,010 --> 02:42:04,830
I think it was in the valley, right?
It's North Ridge, I believe. Yeah.

2948
02:42:04,831 --> 02:42:08,040
It's like all this, like nevermind
was all these classic albums.

2949
02:42:08,041 --> 02:42:09,120
Fleetwood rumors is made.

2950
02:42:09,121 --> 02:42:13,080
They're like the story of all these great
fucking albums and Dave Grohl made the

2951
02:42:13,081 --> 02:42:14,370
movie.
It's fucking great.

2952
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:18,450
But [inaudible] doesn't get nearly enough
credit in the world of great albums

2953
02:42:18,451 --> 02:42:22,230
and people don't talk about like Fleetwood
Mac there. What's better than rumors?

2954
02:42:22,231 --> 02:42:24,550
It's fucking phenomenal.
You and Elsa is great too.

2955
02:42:24,551 --> 02:42:27,240
I just talking about this with a
friend Tusk is pretty amazing too.

2956
02:42:27,270 --> 02:42:31,320
It's pretty fucking good. Yeah. Both due
to Fleetwood Mac was bad at their height.

2957
02:42:31,320 --> 02:42:35,490
There wasn't much better. Yeah, I was
listening to the other day, you know,

2958
02:42:35,550 --> 02:42:39,600
jam band is all about timber lake over
there. That song you make love and fun.

2959
02:42:39,870 --> 02:42:43,770
God Damn, that's a good song. Well,
the rumors is spotless. Yeah. Yeah.

2960
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:46,930
And I say Tusk is too, but some people
would argue, but I love that. Um,

2961
02:42:46,950 --> 02:42:48,200
just because I heard them,

2962
02:42:48,210 --> 02:42:52,140
Gene Simmons made a quote or made
a tweet about a video that, uh,

2963
02:42:52,200 --> 02:42:55,890
I've been meaning to watch for a while
called searching for sugar man. Oh,

2964
02:42:55,891 --> 02:42:59,370
I tell it how it gets
rich. Really good. Um,

2965
02:43:00,540 --> 02:43:04,980
I have a very cynical view
of documentaries sometimes.
So I'm not sure how much,

2966
02:43:05,010 --> 02:43:07,620
but I actually,
I googled it and I didn't find much.

2967
02:43:07,800 --> 02:43:09,990
What I do is I watch documentaries
and I Google it and see how much,

2968
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:12,370
like if there's a lot of
talking about how it's bullshit,

2969
02:43:12,490 --> 02:43:15,870
right. And the bullshit meter on that
one was pretty low. So it could be,

2970
02:43:15,960 --> 02:43:18,750
well then tell the top people with the
story, the pendant, the guy who was it,

2971
02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:20,760
he was a musician in Michigan.

2972
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:23,330
It was like may two albums
that no one had heard of.

2973
02:43:23,710 --> 02:43:26,210
And he went and he think he worked at
maybe some kind of factory or something.

2974
02:43:26,211 --> 02:43:30,890
No, he was unknown for 30 years. It
turns out his albums had taken off in,

2975
02:43:30,950 --> 02:43:34,340
um, uh, South Africa,
South Africa, and he was,

2976
02:43:34,400 --> 02:43:37,880
it was part of the apartheid
movement, really was his,
just the soundtrack to his,

2977
02:43:37,881 --> 02:43:42,730
of his albums. And he didn't know, he was
so famous over there and Elvis fan base.

2978
02:43:42,860 --> 02:43:47,750
And people thought the story had come out
that he died. And like 20 years later,

2979
02:43:48,290 --> 02:43:50,300
someone heard the news that he wasn't.
Dot didn't die.

2980
02:43:50,301 --> 02:43:54,210
He was living in an apartment in Michigan,
Detroit, and they brought him back. Uh,

2981
02:43:54,220 --> 02:43:55,580
you know,
it comes back,

2982
02:43:55,581 --> 02:43:58,070
it's almost like an anvil type thing
where he comes back and he's like,

2983
02:43:58,730 --> 02:44:01,160
goes over there and just plays the
stadiums now. He played Letterman.

2984
02:44:01,161 --> 02:44:03,350
I think he's now going on
tour and playing any gigs.

2985
02:44:03,570 --> 02:44:07,050
He was huge. And meanwhile
just had a family, normal guy,

2986
02:44:07,051 --> 02:44:09,510
raised his daughters
but had no idea that he,

2987
02:44:09,850 --> 02:44:13,800
he was told that these albums were bombs
that they didn't make a penny. Well,

2988
02:44:13,801 --> 02:44:16,780
meanwhile there it's good
music. It's pretty good. Yeah.

2989
02:44:16,810 --> 02:44:18,660
I buddy might just saw the
show here instead. It was good.

2990
02:44:18,750 --> 02:44:21,650
We were talking about our
friends, honey, honey. Um,

2991
02:44:22,290 --> 02:44:25,810
I found out about honey honey through
a guy on my message board who, uh,

2992
02:44:25,830 --> 02:44:29,520
just sent me a dude named balls of steel.
That's his name. Sent me this link.

2993
02:44:29,521 --> 02:44:32,060
And so this is going to be your new
favorite band and I'm one kind of music.

2994
02:44:32,450 --> 02:44:36,300
It's like country rock, like
sort of rock country ish. It's,

2995
02:44:36,340 --> 02:44:39,990
it's very hard to describe. But when we,
when I listened to it I like, I went,

2996
02:44:40,140 --> 02:44:41,760
how the fuck are they not famous?

2997
02:44:41,761 --> 02:44:44,580
Like every now and then you'll
hear music and the whole,

2998
02:44:44,730 --> 02:44:48,870
they have two cds and bolt of them are
excellent and I'm going to go listen to

2999
02:44:48,871 --> 02:44:53,570
this. The, the, the new, the first one
is called First Rodeo and then the, um,

3000
02:44:53,820 --> 02:44:57,480
the second one, I forget what the name
of the second one is, but whatever it is,

3001
02:44:57,481 --> 02:45:00,930
it's, it's a, it's fucking amazing. It's
like you, you listened to it and you go,

3002
02:45:00,931 --> 02:45:04,460
how the fuck is it on iTunes? Famous?
Yeah. Yeah. It's on iTunes. Check it out.

3003
02:45:04,461 --> 02:45:08,430
But I think it's hard as fuck to
make it in the world of music today,

3004
02:45:08,760 --> 02:45:12,180
especially because of the fact that
there's not that much out there as far as

3005
02:45:12,181 --> 02:45:14,830
like radio. There's no dude,
it's admits and pie. If you,

3006
02:45:14,850 --> 02:45:16,670
if you want to play instruments,
if I forget,

3007
02:45:16,680 --> 02:45:19,560
it's not that much as far
as like being able to sell,

3008
02:45:20,370 --> 02:45:22,350
being able to sell videos and shit,

3009
02:45:22,520 --> 02:45:25,350
or being able to sell records
like a good fucking luck man.

3010
02:45:25,410 --> 02:45:26,340
Although it has spread out.
Yeah.

3011
02:45:26,370 --> 02:45:31,300
Till you can make a, it's easier to make
a living like a low, you know, low money.

3012
02:45:31,330 --> 02:45:34,060
There's more, there's more bands
making like 50 grand a year,

3013
02:45:34,070 --> 02:45:36,880
then they're everywhere. But there's
nobody making that like big money.

3014
02:45:37,180 --> 02:45:38,710
That's the thing.
Well

3015
02:45:38,950 --> 02:45:41,920
band, um, they, you know,

3016
02:45:42,340 --> 02:45:45,550
they've been touring around the country
and they're slowly starting to take

3017
02:45:45,551 --> 02:45:50,110
steam, but it doesn't make any sense when
you see some of the shit that's famous.

3018
02:45:50,440 --> 02:45:53,830
And if some of the people are famous,
like these guys are like completely,

3019
02:45:53,890 --> 02:45:56,680
totally legit. Like how
were they? Not huge.

3020
02:45:56,760 --> 02:45:58,470
Well I don't even listen to
the radio anymore. I mean,

3021
02:45:58,471 --> 02:46:01,540
do you listen to like
music on the Radio K rock?

3022
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:06,250
I listened to in La on occasion, but
for the most part, no, but it's just,

3023
02:46:06,690 --> 02:46:09,320
it takes more than being talented today.

3024
02:46:09,620 --> 02:46:14,620
Today we're in this weird like void area
where what you're starting to get his

3025
02:46:15,111 --> 02:46:19,190
people that become famous through the
Internet, through people retweeting and,

3026
02:46:19,350 --> 02:46:22,850
and, and sending their, you know,
youtube likes and stuff like that.

3027
02:46:22,851 --> 02:46:25,790
Like you're starting to see that,
but like put out,

3028
02:46:25,820 --> 02:46:29,350
putting on a CD and just releasing
it in a record store, it's not,

3029
02:46:29,370 --> 02:46:30,203
doesn't happen me.

3030
02:46:30,250 --> 02:46:34,120
So those days are gone. It doesn't exist.
You have to have an internet presence,

3031
02:46:35,080 --> 02:46:37,150
which, which is cool. If you were a band,

3032
02:46:37,360 --> 02:46:40,210
let's say from a small town in Kentucky
and you wanted to get your music out

3033
02:46:40,211 --> 02:46:43,690
there, it's a different world. You can
get it to get it everywhere. But yeah,

3034
02:46:44,680 --> 02:46:49,600
it's harder to make that giant leap.
Yeah. Well, um, but you made it dude,

3035
02:46:49,810 --> 02:46:52,360
look at you. Yeah, exactly. Can
comedy central the fucking biggest.

3036
02:46:52,361 --> 02:46:55,780
I'm the hottest comedian. Chavez live
in large. Did they let you into the, uh,

3037
02:46:55,870 --> 02:47:00,030
Daniel Tosh Hooker factory? Where are
you going to see all the process? No,

3038
02:47:00,130 --> 02:47:03,730
I've never met him. Give you
the golden robe. I listen.

3039
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:06,120
I got to get some higher numbers
before I get to that. Yeah.

3040
02:47:06,130 --> 02:47:09,100
Tosh apparently can sell
out stadiums with one tweet.

3041
02:47:09,430 --> 02:47:14,230
Seriously puts out one tweet and he sells
out like 20 stadiums in a row. Yeah,

3042
02:47:14,310 --> 02:47:18,340
he's, he's balling the lead
into my show is a rerun.

3043
02:47:18,341 --> 02:47:23,100
If his show that beats my shot. I mean
like an old raven fucking good show, man.

3044
02:47:23,140 --> 02:47:26,040
Anybody who has anything to say
bad about that shows a hater.

3045
02:47:26,110 --> 02:47:28,300
That's a good solid fucking,
sorry man.

3046
02:47:28,301 --> 02:47:31,960
I can't say anything bad about a show
that, that my show that paid for my show.

3047
02:47:32,920 --> 02:47:36,460
You know, what am I going to say? Hey,
I recommend tosh point hole by the way,

3048
02:47:36,461 --> 02:47:38,890
which is called the movies
at the hotel in San Diego.

3049
02:47:38,891 --> 02:47:43,660
It's a gay tosh recommend that.
Stop. Was that really in a hotel?

3050
02:47:44,080 --> 02:47:48,280
That's not cool. How rude you
fuck. Um, this Friday night,

3051
02:47:48,310 --> 02:47:53,260
Brian is going to be at the Ice House
in Pasadena with Tony Hinchcliffe.

3052
02:47:53,261 --> 02:47:53,710
Who else?

3053
02:47:53,710 --> 02:47:57,610
Kevin Christie Shula and there's a bunch
of people that are going to be added to

3054
02:47:57,611 --> 02:47:59,830
the show in the next day or two.
But tickets or at ice house,

3055
02:47:59,831 --> 02:48:03,420
comedy.com it's t at,
uh, 10 o'clock. Yeah.

3056
02:48:03,740 --> 02:48:07,490
That place is the ice house.
If you'd never been there to us.

3057
02:48:07,491 --> 02:48:10,940
Like right now that's like our, our base.
That's pretty much our home base, right?

3058
02:48:10,970 --> 02:48:13,820
I mean that's, that's kind of a
mecca for comedians these days.

3059
02:48:13,821 --> 02:48:17,960
It's a really unusual spot. It's a
beautiful club. It's in Pasadena.

3060
02:48:17,961 --> 02:48:20,040
It's the oldest club in the
country, I believe. Yeah.

3061
02:48:20,180 --> 02:48:22,610
I think it was in the 1950s
that they first opened.

3062
02:48:22,611 --> 02:48:25,680
And became a comedy club in the 60s,
51st anniversary.

3063
02:48:26,030 --> 02:48:30,160
Jesus Christ 51st fucking anniversary
mean. That's, that's insanity man.

3064
02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:32,100
Yeah.
That is a long time.

3065
02:48:32,130 --> 02:48:35,310
And that Steve Martin used to do it in
his book that you can get on audible.

3066
02:48:35,311 --> 02:48:38,040
He talks about the ice house throughout
that whole thing. I read that book,

3067
02:48:38,041 --> 02:48:40,800
but after your recommendation, I want,
I want to listen to that book. Yeah.

3068
02:48:40,801 --> 02:48:42,640
Well we're there all
the time. I'll be, yeah,

3069
02:48:42,710 --> 02:48:47,660
they're a probably again, uh, next
week when I get back from, um, uh,

3070
02:48:47,661 --> 02:48:51,380
Nashville this weekend I'll schedule
something and we try to do it.

3071
02:48:51,381 --> 02:48:54,980
Like last time was Ari and Ian and Brian
and we just tried to do like all of our

3072
02:48:54,981 --> 02:48:59,540
friends. And so it's a, it's a beautiful,
awesome club to, to just to be in.

3073
02:48:59,541 --> 02:49:03,560
It's a part of comedy. He
history. It really is. And
uh, and we support that place.

3074
02:49:03,980 --> 02:49:04,710
Like it's

3075
02:49:04,710 --> 02:49:08,170
like it's a god, that was a
great show, man. Last Wednesday.
That was a great show.

3076
02:49:08,190 --> 02:49:12,360
It was pretty fun, man. Yeah. Oh
yeah. That was the drunk name. Yeah.

3077
02:49:12,361 --> 02:49:16,070
That was the whole fucked up on stage. It
was funny. We were all fucked up. Yeah.

3078
02:49:16,090 --> 02:49:18,870
Yeah. I don't know. Yeah, Shane,
I haven't talked to Shane since.

3079
02:49:18,871 --> 02:49:21,630
I called them to apologize the next day.
I'm like, I might have yelled at you, man.

3080
02:49:21,660 --> 02:49:25,710
I don't know what I did. He answered the
phone. Did he text her call back? Oh,

3081
02:49:26,660 --> 02:49:28,930
we did. Is that right? It's just,

3082
02:49:28,980 --> 02:49:32,400
but I think I yelled at some other dude
named Matt. It's a lot of craziness.

3083
02:49:32,640 --> 02:49:37,230
Do you drank then? I used to drink a
lot. I'm still like not on purpose.

3084
02:49:37,231 --> 02:49:39,930
I just haven't. I'm just getting too
old for it or something. I Dunno.

3085
02:49:40,590 --> 02:49:45,510
I'm 37 hope dare you. Yeah. I
just started drinking Jackson.

3086
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:48,030
I just, I don't know. I can't
hold my alcohol anymore.

3087
02:49:48,031 --> 02:49:50,530
It's just the weight of the last like
five times I drank has been really odd,

3088
02:49:50,531 --> 02:49:52,790
but then you need to party with
some loose reminded people.

3089
02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:56,310
You need to hang with us a little bit.
