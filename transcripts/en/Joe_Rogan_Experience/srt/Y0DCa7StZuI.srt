1
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,383
Oops.

2
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,920
And people can say all they
want about like the soccer.

3
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:44,730
Rob was old and he's definitely, he's
definitely, definitely, but dude,

4
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:48,570
you dismantled him.
That was like the most,

5
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,280
the cleanest, most like precise
performance of your career yet.

6
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,010
I was just like, all right, do this,
this myth to perfect. It was perfect.

7
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,190
It was just perfection.

8
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,320
Yeah. Poor guy. Yeah. That's
business. You know his business. Yeah.

9
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,740
I get old and hopefully,
hopefully it'll slide out before that guy,

10
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,970
after Melvin Manhoef he should have
been like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

11
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,100
What's up man? Exactly. Yeah Dude,
that's business. It's like, you know,

12
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,900
it's kind of like a guy I
looked up to for so long and,

13
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,980
and one of those things like I feel
it's a big respect to the guy and I feel

14
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:28,360
like I owe a lot of my career
is due to him. So yeah,

15
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,880
definitely those who don't
follow mixed martial arts.

16
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:35,020
Sakharov was a famous Japanese guy who
was one of the first guys to beat the

17
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:38,000
Gracies and he fought a bunch
of them. You know, he fought,

18
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,170
fought hoist a couple of
times. They fought for 90
years and the legacy that guy,

19
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:46,090
yeah. I mean, he's just that that is as
legacy his legacy gets. Yeah. He's a,

20
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:48,040
you know,
you list like all time favorites,

21
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,130
got damn soccer robbers on everybody's
list. Some of those fight to the end.

22
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,430
Fucking always fuck out. That's what I
mean by what I mean by that is that, yeah,

23
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,980
I like exactly the mentality that he
would always take into a fight is what I

24
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:02,380
did when I was younger.
I mean,

25
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,430
you know what I always like was
like thinking that's what, you know,

26
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,160
they built my,
what you have to be to be a fighter.

27
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,820
That's what it built my value system.
I was like, yeah, you have to do that.

28
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,380
Which kept me working hard and mixed
martial arts all the way to this point.

29
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:21,610
You know, like the, so I have
to, they say, you want to
fight him? I'm like, yeah,

30
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:25,960
I have to fight them. Like I respect,
you know, I can't, oh no, I'm not gonna.

31
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,800
I'm not gonna fight soccer. I was like,
you know, like on, I'm going to fight.

32
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,460
Fuck Robin.
When someone's going to find them,

33
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,810
you get when and what other place in life
do you get to walk up to your hero and

34
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:39,040
punch his fucking face? What? Where
did that happen? You're my hero.

35
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,930
I get to punch your fucking face. Damn.
What a trip that must've been. Yeah.

36
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,010
You know what I mean? Like I
was like, ma'am, you my hero,

37
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,780
but I'm going to try to smash you.

38
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:50,050
Read is what are the w is
there a moment in your mind,

39
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:53,700
in the fight while you're realizing
you're doing this or you? So yeah,

40
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,280
for sure you were relaxed because I
remember the exact moment that I was like,

41
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,100
ah, I got him in this one
move and then I like put,

42
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,730
put my hand on his face and I put my
hand on his face and punched him and I'm

43
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:07,990
like, man, I'm punting. Fuck
or Robert Right now. Wow.

44
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,880
What did I brief? Like little blink
of a moment when you went back.

45
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,240
Then I was like, oh, you gotta be, you
gotta beat him up. I was like, oh no.

46
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,270
To me it was like, okay,
I'm a robot. Like I wrote,

47
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,500
I wrote for fight magazine before it,
like I'm a robe or Nah,

48
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:25,510
I think it was on my blog and I wrote,
I'm a robot in there.

49
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:27,370
I just like go in there and like,

50
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:32,050
I feel like I'm driving a robot so
I'm just doing this, you know, like,

51
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,620
you know, I'm just doing it like I'm
behind my eyes playing video games. Right.

52
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,680
You know what I mean? Like Oh,
I'm playing Xbox right now.

53
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,740
Is that the best way to keep emotions out?
Fuck yeah.

54
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,200
Cause I'd fought like
messed up my fights before.

55
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:47,920
I'm like God killed him and then
I'm like, ah, I'm tired right now.

56
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:50,470
Like what the hell? You know, you
gotta be like looked out. Yeah,

57
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:54,670
it's more for me at least.
I know some guys have to get
more psyched up, you know?

58
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:58,130
But for me, I just know that I have
to like chill myself out so I don't go

59
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,120
to bananas. So you just fight,
just say, just do it on a robot.

60
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,050
But every once while you've got to go
into your crazy gene and get retard

61
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:08,420
strength and that's when
you're in a bad spot. No. Yeah.

62
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,100
That's where he's just got to get like,
I gotta like hulk out of it.

63
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:13,000
It's like Hulkamania is that was what,

64
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,720
remember when you were fighting GSP and
that's what, yeah, I know it's famous.

65
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,490
Yeah. What's his face? Why am I blanking
on his name? I know mark laymen.

66
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,060
Mark laymen. Jesus Christ. I'm blanking
on Mark Layman's name, but what?

67
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,800
Mark Lehman and he's
yelling retard strength.

68
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,340
And I was saying his corner
is yelling out retards.

69
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,100
Famous. Oh, I did it came famous.
Yeah, recharge. I remember. No,

70
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:40,040
I remember the people are like, because
those, like I wanted everybody to know.

71
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:44,480
I'm like, his corner is calling out
for real. Like you need to know this

72
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,180
is the shit man.

73
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,700
Layman is not easy to just not only just
a really good Jujitsu instructor based

74
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:55,580
soccer. Cool dude to talk to.
He's a smart guy. Super Smart.

75
00:06:55,581 --> 00:07:00,230
Like smart. I know. Yeah. It's
a smart dude. Jujitsu, you know,

76
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:04,670
he breaks things down. You know, it's
uh, he's a, he's a fascinating dude.

77
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,940
He's a character. I love that
guy. He's a fascinating dude.

78
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,370
Jujitsu filled with fascinating people.

79
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,870
That's what a lot of
people don't understand.

80
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,970
They think of Jujitsu is being like
some sort of a meathead thing. Art,

81
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,480
it's just for people that don't
know that they think that though.

82
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:21,200
But I mean a lot of the guys that we
train with her like computer guys are like

83
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:24,020
guys who that athletic back in the day.

84
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,860
Like I felt like Jiu Jitsu is this
like exclusive and expensive thing.

85
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,680
You know what I mean? Like, oh,
like not many people did it,

86
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:35,681
but the people who did it were like
well educated and they know the latest

87
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:39,450
thing. Right. And it was Brazilian
Jiu Jitsu, you know, so when I,

88
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:42,800
I remember I would be in there broke as
hell, you know, training and then, no,

89
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:47,510
it'd be like four years and you know,
doctors and chiropractors then whatever,

90
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:50,750
you know, like, and I've just like some
poor kid. Like I would go to the gyms,

91
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,460
you know, it is expensive. That does
keep a log. Keep out the riff Raff.

92
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,440
Yeah. That's a funny way of thinking it.
Right. Did you Jitsu super expensive?

93
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,940
Well,
not anymore really anymore.

94
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,220
A lot of guys have it look a
buck 75 a month to 50 a month.

95
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:11,180
Like I read that all over the place to
50 bucks, dude, that's Truong money.

96
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,050
That's strong money. If you're
making like you know, $700 a week,

97
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:18,110
which like a lot of people are, that's
what you bring home. If you're doing well,

98
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:19,740
you're doing pretty well there.
And then

99
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,710
Jim, are you driving by right
now? Joe Rogan was not driving by,

100
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,240
I'm like reading shit online.

101
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,280
I'm like people how much people charge
for Jujitsu classes and I think Hansel's

102
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,570
or s somewhere around there.

103
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,740
I think John John jocks over like one 75
one especially when a lot of people use

104
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:43,850
it as an exercise and I paid like
$39 a month from it and you go down

105
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,440
there, you could talk him down. Yo, you
could talk Machado down. Let's talk about,

106
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,850
just come on. He's a cool guy.
I wouldn't, I wouldn't. I would.

107
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,070
It's worth everything and more. He's,
he's great. It was a great year,

108
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:59,310
but I understand where people are.
If people are broke,

109
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,020
I understand broke motherfucker. I would
roll up in there and be like, dude,

110
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,290
come on man. Just give me some
Jujitsu just a little bit.

111
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,690
Just give me a fucking bro and I'll
take six weeks out. Don't worry.

112
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,980
Come on man. I'll pay you. Oh, that's
cute. I don't like this new setup. Look,

113
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,550
this is me and red band sitting here,
man.

114
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,351
But now,

115
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:26,430
but now we look like we're in Goddamn
aliens like were in the bunker right now

116
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,960
we're in a bunker over here and Joe
Rogan is missile command right now.

117
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,790
Man told Joe Rogan is
like or touching you.

118
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,070
I can't even tell her room right now.

119
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,860
Should we be paying attention
to these electronics?

120
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:40,380
You just looking at this
screen, this screen it. I know,

121
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,570
but this is what everyone else sees.
No,

122
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,770
most of them were like in a bunker.

123
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,510
Me Or red banner in a bunker
right out like Joe Rogan.

124
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,640
It's somewhere in this house.
Joe Rogan is here.

125
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,480
I guess people don't, sometimes they
just lift and most people are listening.

126
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,020
Oh my. It's a tiny fraction
of the cost. See watching man,

127
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:04,010
but what about my screen?
What about my screenshot?

128
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,570
Like this guy is loud as fuck.
Is he talking about?

129
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,330
They don't even know if I idea
what you're talking about. Oh,

130
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,280
well here's the punchline. Everybody is
the computer screen I was talking about.

131
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,430
He's looking at the computer screen with
the live viewers are saying chasing me.

132
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,210
It looks like taking some big shots since
the last time I seen him taking some

133
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:27,210
shots. But Hey, what?
What's the deal with the,

134
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,920
what is the most you've ever felt like
after a sparring session or after a fight?

135
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,320
I'm like, what's the most
he ever felt like, Whoa,

136
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,590
I just got to settle the fuck down.
What's the most,

137
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,140
do you remember a fight or
if or sparring session or,

138
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,710
cause you've had some crazy sparring.
Actually had some dumb ones.

139
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,020
Like we're only human bronies to Ronnie.

140
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:53,870
You slam it out or use the
damn box it out. Like, man.
I'm like, yeah, this is fun.

141
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,000
But afterwards you're like, ah
man, I'm stupid right now. Yeah,

142
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,270
there's a lot of guys.
I mean,

143
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:04,200
how many guys do you know that that did
that too much and they're just not there

144
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:07,440
anymore? I don't know. It's a
few guys. Right? I know one guy,

145
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,650
I'm 42 I know a few guys
starting to know guys,

146
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:12,740
guys that used to be okay
and the other not. Why me?

147
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,780
I don't really know Nick Diaz, but,
but you know what I'm saying. Right.

148
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,320
If you go, if you don't know, this has
been addressed on a previous podcast,

149
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:23,230
but Jason May have know her,

150
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:27,700
but there was a big incident at CBS where
Jason got into the cage and asked Jake

151
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,110
shields a question. He got jumped
by everybody and it was nuts.

152
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:34,270
It was Nick Diaz was one of
the guys that was involved in,

153
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,360
did he throw the first punch?
Is that was allegedly,

154
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:41,390
is that what happened simultaneously with
three other people and it was the bay.

155
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,850
It's probably the best picture ever meet
with my hands, but like what's up guys?

156
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,140
So reject the whole thing is so
ridiculous. It was so unnecessary.

157
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,650
It was so unnecessary on
so many fronts and then,

158
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,860
and we talked about this last time,
we should bring it up again,

159
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:56,830
but I think it was bullshit that you
got in trouble for it. I think I go,

160
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:59,920
he got jumped. He got assaulted. Yes
he shouldn't have been in the cage,

161
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:02,560
but it doesn't mean you should be
assaulting him and I don't even think it's

162
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:04,850
their fault because it's so
many fucking people in the cage.

163
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:07,740
It shouldn't have been in there. You
can't have that many people in the cages.

164
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,270
You shouldn't blame,
blame and strike force for letting those,

165
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,820
you guys get close to each other.
They should have been regulating it.

166
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,500
They should've watched a cage. I think
they were fucked up to jump you for sure.

167
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,090
But I think the reason
why they jumped users,

168
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:21,340
you were allowed to get in that cage.
You shouldn't have been allowed to.

169
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,690
They should have had it all set up.

170
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,330
It should have been like how they would
do it to the UFC or if you were going to

171
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:27,310
come in and you were going to challenge,
you know,

172
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:30,940
after a fight you would wait and then
when you know Jake was done talking,

173
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:31,751
then we'd say,
all right,

174
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,500
now I have a guy who would really love
to sit down and talk to you right now.

175
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,950
Jason May Have Miller and you would
come in. So it's like respectful.

176
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,920
They fucked up by just
leaving the door open.

177
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,820
We're going to leave the door open and
do is get hyped up and like, I want to,

178
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,750
I want to fuck when you've
got to do some of us. Well,

179
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
you're doing something on TV, so
I'm sure you're thinking like, fuck,

180
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:52,060
what am I doing? I'm going to
get in. All right, here we go.

181
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:56,570
I'm just going to do this.
It makes perfect sense. Yeah,

182
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,770
let's do this. Like there's very
little filter on my brain. We got,

183
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:03,210
were you sober at the time? Yeah,
totally. So bad. I was like, hmm,

184
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,510
this is a good idea. I just fought
earlier that night. Right? That's right.

185
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:09,760
That's right. And I thought authority,
Corals Psych, right? Yeah. Okay,

186
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,840
so you're flying high. Yeah, exactly. So I
was real pumped. I mean, you know, right.

187
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,810
I Dunno. And then all of a
sudden we're getting there.

188
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,130
I'm in a bra and I tweet woop. So you
start up this website. Don't be scared.

189
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:25,060
homey.com because uh,
Nick Diaz is a,

190
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:27,370
it's difficult to get a fight with them.
Is that what's going on?

191
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,110
What's the actual real cause I know
this is all I know is what I read on the

192
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,230
Internet. Tell me what's
going on man. He says,

193
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,510
don't be scared homie all the time. Right.
That's his, he says, don't be scared.

194
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:43,360
Right. That's his little
tagline. I stoled it if my mouth,

195
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,910
that's awesome. And look, the
guy that you own don't be scared.

196
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:53,800
homey.com and that site is all dedicated
to you getting a fight when Nikki is,

197
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,860
well, you know, to me I
like, yeah, definitely.

198
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,500
You are a nightmare.

199
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,970
Imagine pissed may hem off and mayhem
was coming after you let it Nate.

200
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,100
Man, he's relentless. He's
relentless like you are.

201
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:11,600
You're in this, it's
not like it's, you know,

202
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,670
you're just calling some random personnel.

203
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:18,640
You're calling a guy out who's an MMA
fighter who you have in all he fights.

204
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,270
He's fought so many times.
One 83 he always fights there.

205
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,940
But then when it's me, somebody, he's
talked shit about like for years,

206
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:31,660
the guys talk shit about me and
without fail my name, all these guys,

207
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,670
these f bombs with wood painted hair,
these Joe Rogan words with painted hair,

208
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,180
you know, like he's, you know,

209
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,470
he said all these terrible things about
you Paul with hill. So where's the end?

210
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:48,120
But yeah, and when it comes down to
signing a contract, what is this? Oh,

211
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,100
here she is. His manager
comes on answers. Oh yeah.

212
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:56,390
Well if he fights it a one
78 I'm like, okay, cool.

213
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,220
I'll fight Alistair Overeem.
He just has to make one 90 that's it.

214
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,100
I'll fight them. I'm fucking
fight that fucker this weekend.

215
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,710
One night he's going to make one night,
right? Yeah. I mean he got loose.

216
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:12,790
Can you push that? Yeah, we'll, we'll do
what you do. Do, do, do, do dude. Wow.

217
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,950
It hurts my ears. Oh, sorry
bro. Here we go. Here. I got it.

218
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,960
I got it. Let's touch me.
Red Band. So he wants,

219
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,830
he's saying that he wants you to get
down to one 78 which is highly unlikely.

220
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,900
So John, you want to do it in January?
I like, yeah, I, there's no way.

221
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,220
And Jason used to fight.

222
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,070
He fought in the UFC at one seven
goddamn skeleton. God, dude,

223
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,000
that was a skeleton. It was the
dumbest thing I ever did. I was like,

224
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:42,040
why did I do that?

225
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,430
He may seem to you and I
had a conversation about it
where I was yelling at you.

226
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,600
I was like, you can't do this man, don't
this diet. That shit is too. I'm like,

227
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:55,100
I'm like, this is too much,
man. This ain't good. This,
there's a lot of guys, man,

228
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:58,190
that I think fight better when
they don't have to cut weight.

229
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,880
They just feel better. Like look how
much better BJ looked in his last fight.

230
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:02,300
I don't know.

231
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,060
I don't know if that's just the way
they match up with him and Matt Hughes,

232
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,490
but he just looked like
going into the cage.

233
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,150
You lived did not look healthy when he
made one 55 the last time. He always does.

234
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:14,750
He always looks a little drawn out. He
always looks great during the fight time,

235
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:19,400
but he always looks a little
down the magic that you
don't, man, it's hard to do.

236
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,233
Like

237
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,620
even cutting a little bit of weight
is scheduling yourself really well.

238
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:28,280
You know what I mean? And like
the right way. Yeah, exactly.

239
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:33,260
Suck the water out the right way. And
Rick rehydrate the right way to use ivs.

240
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,470
Yeah. Yeah. You should always
use ivy. Yeah, of course.

241
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:40,100
Because I hear some guys don't like to
use them. I'm like, God damn. You know,

242
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:40,961
they looked at,

243
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:43,460
I feel like they're doing something gross
so they're sticking a needle in them.

244
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,400
You know what I mean? Yeah. Whatever.
That's science put more in there.

245
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,410
That's the way to do it if
you're going to do it at all.

246
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:50,780
But because I mean you have to
drop weight. That's the thing,

247
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,350
like that's what you think about guys
like Frankie Edgar guys that just don't

248
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:58,100
cut any weight at all. They just fight
it. What they find out. I mean, you know,

249
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,040
that's awesome.
I do think there's a benefit to that.

250
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,320
There's gotta be a benefit
physically. Right? For sure.

251
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,181
You don't have to cut the weight,

252
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:06,560
so you don't have to like
damage yourself that bad.

253
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,810
How much do you damage yourself
if you had a gun or, no man,

254
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:12,940
I think sitting in a hot box for a long
time will take years off your life for

255
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,500
fuck yeah,
thanks.

256
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,740
Adjusted the microphone. Like he
was changing the collar on a tiger,

257
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,840
preplanned it for like 10 in 10 or
15 seconds. I was looking at it like,

258
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:30,080
all right, I'm just gonna go in there
real quick. I even thought about, hey, go,

259
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,350
hey Jason, look at that over there and
do them of those things. So if you,

260
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,530
let me get back to the subject, because
this is a fascinating subject for me.

261
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,280
Yeah. If you, if you lose weight, so like
say if I'm say, what do you walk around?

262
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:44,120
I like to 10 so I'm like,
well actually I'm not less than that.

263
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,920
Two Two oh seven now when you get,

264
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,870
when you get to the point where
you're about to cut weight,

265
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:49,980
like when you're in training camp,
when do you start

266
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,300
to dehydrate yourself? Do you take
like three days? Two days, three days,

267
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,320
two well to really, and so when you
started to, how heavy are you? Uh,

268
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,550
I don't know. Two. Oh, probably
two oh three two two a two.

269
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,960
So you got to lose somewhere between
1517 pounds. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

270
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,700
And it's in three but I mean,

271
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:12,660
but I'm already reduced my calories and
meeting of the week so that I'm losing.

272
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:13,650
Some are like,

273
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,570
you [inaudible] like I'm just really light
and most of my calories are from like

274
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,340
water calories. So I'm like hydrated
then bolt and then dropped my,

275
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,550
drop my weight, all that he'd
done there. Yeah. I mean,

276
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:28,890
I know it will take some time off your
life because I'm sitting here in the

277
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:33,270
thought of box with the damn plastic suit
on doing hoppies, right? One, two, three,

278
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:36,680
four, five, six. So you think that
the benefit that gives you, yeah,

279
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,920
age is well worth it. Most of us are
doing it, so you know what I mean?

280
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:44,550
Like both guys are like bigger
anyway. Isn't that crazy though? Yeah.

281
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,190
Well what the hell you every little,
every competitive edge and I know,

282
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,760
but I mean you guys both try to find,
you're both doing it.

283
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,930
Is it a competitive edge? Yeah, we
it it'd be better if you have just,

284
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:59,610
she shakes if I said can yeah, just say,

285
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:03,870
listen man, don't be
crazy. Everybody's nervous.

286
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,620
Whatever. I know it's a funny thing
though, isn't it? To be like that.

287
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,340
I wish we could just shake hands like, Yo,
let's just do it like this weekend bro.

288
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:15,000
Like you know, oh like
little away. Come on,

289
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,180
step off our barstools right now,
the cutting weight things.

290
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,040
I think it's a very unfortunate
situation where guys, hey man,

291
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,640
you're not fucking doing it bro.
It's a fucking headache.

292
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,190
It's the only part of my job
that I'm like, this is bullshit.

293
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,000
This only part of my job.
Like, man, I wish I could
just go, hey dude, let's just,

294
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,510
let's keep it real right now.
The fights would be better to write.

295
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,330
Maybe we have more energy, but that
was the question. Like how much,

296
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,670
what percentage do you think
it takes away from you?

297
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:45,720
Say if you're at 100% at two 10 like this
right now, I don't know man. I want him,

298
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,770
I want to say 100% I'm back.
I want to say that. Yeah,

299
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,180
I want to rehydrate.
You get back to 100% I think so.

300
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,700
I think 24 I've had it
where like, I'm like, yeah,

301
00:19:56,701 --> 00:20:00,030
24 you got it down to a science
now I'm 24 hours. Most of the,

302
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,630
I fucked up before for sure. Like I've
had bad equipment and that kind of thing.

303
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:08,700
It's fucking in Chicago we didn't have
a damn dry sauna. Oh really? Yeah.

304
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:12,960
No Dry Sauna. It's, you know. So what do
you do that you turn the heat on or saw?

305
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,460
My God,
we're in there anyway.

306
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:18,550
Trying to slit the weight out and it took
forever and I was fucking dying and I

307
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:22,800
had forgot to go fight five. She's 25
but you know, five by 25, you know,

308
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,570
but the damn, um, well
what do you call it? Uh,

309
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:31,440
it's just like part of the game, you
know? So what, don't cry about it.

310
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,670
You chose this life so you can
just figure out another way to cut.

311
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,000
What do you do if you don't have a sauna?

312
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,180
So you have to cut how many pounds of
water he trying to cut by the last day?

313
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,120
Uh, tenish and 10. Yeah. So when it loud,

314
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,890
maybe like I've tried to
be making like ish, but

315
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,860
I, I've cut weight perfect
before, but, but you know,

316
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,900
sometimes there'll be a 10 or 11 and I've
done that. If you don't have a sauna,

317
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,580
does new and try to trick you. But we
did it, bro. I did it before that fight.

318
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,080
You but would, you said you
didn't have a sauna, right? Yeah,

319
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:08,140
we didn't have a sign up, but I did
it. What'd you do? The steam room.

320
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:12,280
It was steam room. Oh, so he did
it in a steamer? Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

321
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:14,470
So we didn't have the same thing.
Right. You sweat it out, right.

322
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:19,120
I is it the same moisture
on, yeah. Close you off.

323
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:21,730
So it takes long die, but I, you
know, whatever. I just worked,

324
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:23,920
that's just me and I had a bike
harder and stuff like that.

325
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:26,410
I had to like swept myself out worse,
you know?

326
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,280
So you think that after
the Ivs and everything like
that or your performance is

327
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:34,000
at 100% of your capacity or close enough
to it, right. You Do, you do it right.

328
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,380
If you from fuck up. I mean that's just
how it is. Here's a fucking science this.

329
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,990
Yeah, of course. I mean,
but you know, and my mat,

330
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,970
like my coach knows how much
I sweat. Like he's like, oh,

331
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,210
we got it timed out about right.
Like Ah, he's got to do this.

332
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,440
You know what I mean? Like in time it
is, everybody is different, right? Yeah.

333
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:50,970
For sure.

334
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,400
A good coach has to recognize that and
be working with a bunch of different guys

335
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:56,110
and see a bunch of different,
very different, yeah.

336
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,420
There's some dudes you can't
really cut that much weight.

337
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,600
They get to a certain point they brought
it just don't work anymore and some

338
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:04,300
dudes can do it.
Some dudes can do huge superhuman amounts.

339
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,380
Thiago Alves like what? Gleason
t bow. What the fuck dude.

340
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:12,820
Glace and t bow fights at
one 55 and the dude is huge.

341
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,810
He's gigantic.
When he gets in the cage,

342
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:19,540
he's got these bodybuilder arms and back
and shit and you're like this mother

343
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:20,171
fucker ways.

344
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:25,171
One 55 he looks like he easily won 85 he
looks like he's 30 pounds heavier and I

345
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:27,910
don't know what he actually
ways when he gets in the cage,

346
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,020
they do that with boxing.
They make the guys way in the day of,

347
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,580
I don't think they want to
see those numbers in the UFC.

348
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,230
I know they're so different.
I don't want to,

349
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:40,210
I don't think they want to see no thirties
you might see a 30 day I go Alvarez

350
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,430
might see at 30 you might see
at 200 200 pound welterweight.

351
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:49,480
Holy Shit Dude,
that's a robotic goddamn weight to lose.

352
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,400
I don't know how these guys do it.

353
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,190
They all have different methods and every
camp has like their own dude who's a

354
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,050
master at that shit. Who's at what
camp is the best? It cutting weight.

355
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,200
There's some camps are just known for
cutting tremendous amounts of weight.

356
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:06,880
Like Att, they're known, they're known
for doing it. They cut a lot of weight.

357
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,190
I don't know. Did they have
a guy? How does that work?

358
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:13,270
Do they have like one guy who's like
the the master trainer and master weight

359
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:18,040
cut strategist. I Dunno. How do you
guys get there? Yeah, Ryan. Yeah,

360
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Ryan Barson more.

361
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,160
You're more manager who can cause
you can kind of know yourself.

362
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,080
So moreover you need somebody to
like know exactly when to do it.

363
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:33,550
Like be your coach. You know what I mean?
Through it. So, and Ryan, he knows how to,

364
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,660
you know, that's what you guys have
such an interesting relationship now.

365
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,600
If people don't know
Ryan is Ryan Parsons is,

366
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,470
he's been around for many, many years.
Coach some of the, the, you know,

367
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,090
great guys in the business, spent a
lot of time with Dan Henderson and,

368
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,330
and Randy coture and he's a, he's a
brilliant guy. Very, very brilliant guy.

369
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:57,740
And he's a manager and trainer to you
and just a couple of their fighters and

370
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:01,550
King Mo and uh, this new guy,
what's his name? Pat. Pat.

371
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,870
Pat Company Durkin and it just a few.
He works with just a few guys.

372
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,920
You guys have like this incredibly
tight relationship, man. That's a trip,

373
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,480
you know, good guy, great
guy, great guy. And,

374
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,250
but the whole set up the way
you guys have it, you know,

375
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,360
like this one guy running around training
and managing this fucking select group

376
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:24,650
of killers and guiding them. It's a
fickle, interesting situation. It is.

377
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,230
It's great. It's like,
you know, we, uh, tight,

378
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,770
tight knit group and we all train hard
and whatever, you know, it's like a,

379
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:34,900
we don't need to open the
floodgates and Brian, right. Yeah.

380
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,860
Individualized attention. It's definitely
better, right? Yeah, definitely,

381
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,820
definitely. And on a core tight
group that you can totally,

382
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:45,590
completely count on the team. You
know, we're a team but we're not like,

383
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,570
hey everybody come hang out with us. And
we're like, we're a tight knit team. Yeah.

384
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:53,510
For people who don't know, like
you're, you're such a wild dude.

385
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:58,040
You're always crazy and yelling and shit,
but you're very disciplined, you know?

386
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:01,880
And that's what people probably either
wouldn't expect or don't understand.

387
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,900
You're very disciplined. Like
even though you're wild, hard man,

388
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,210
don't show up for flights out of shape.
You know what I mean?

389
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:11,120
Maybe there's one or two times in your
whole career where you haven't taken

390
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:13,130
someone as seriously as it should have.
It's true.

391
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:17,330
You're pretty goddamn discipline.
Yeah. I am. I, I'm a Dork.

392
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,050
I like, I want to play video games. Right.

393
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,900
But look how much time you spend
training very fucking diesel.

394
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:26,810
But what I'm saying is you go train
and then you play video games. I mean,

395
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,210
you're draining bay tech. That's
the bit that's like, yeah,

396
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:33,110
but I played video games that for this
or you don't, yeah, that's my reward.

397
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:36,890
Or you know, whatever. Like I dunno,
I like to read and write and stuff.

398
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,350
It's easier to live that way. So
going back to this Nick Diaz, thanks.

399
00:25:40,351 --> 00:25:44,560
So you've been trying so hard to
get this fight and what do they do?

400
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,260
It is if you'll fight it. No,
they're saying no because the, yeah,

401
00:25:48,261 --> 00:25:50,810
one seven that's saying no.
That thing,

402
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:54,380
no one 78 is saying no,

403
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,180
but he's no one 83 plenty of times.
And then it's just the fun.

404
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:02,270
Scott Smith shamrock.
Who else did he find out a way?

405
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:05,630
I don't know guys that he could beat up,
but he can't beat me up.

406
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,460
This is a fucking very important fight
for ya. Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

407
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:13,880
I'm angry about the whole
thing like I need, I need this.

408
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,750
Like I'm going to beat you up. You
shouldn't have jumped me. I'm a nice guy.

409
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,370
He bullied me. Right. He bullied and
beat him down? Yes. Really deep down.

410
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,880
Oh yeah,
about Thursdays at 10 30

411
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,780
10 30 and MTV.

412
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:35,030
MTV was a clip from season three which is
fantastic. That you should watch. What?

413
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:39,470
What were you when you got in
there and got in the ring? Oh wait,

414
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:43,590
one tweeted at me, bro. Why don't you
tweet me, Bro. I did. I tweeted it today.

415
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,670
Did you tweet it today? Yeah,
I'm looking back through red pen.

416
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,010
All bombed right now.

417
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,250
Tweeted it today. I actually, somebody
tweeted to me and I retweeted it. Yeah.

418
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,330
Oh, so you just gave me a
retweet. Alyssa. Man, let's just,

419
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,880
I dunno bro. If it doesn't have
your name on it, fucking hurt.

420
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,723
It doesn't have your name.

421
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,730
All right. See, look, I'll
show it to you right here.

422
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,470
It doesn't have your name on Joe Rogan,
red Bam.

423
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:10,070
And have you seen Ma'am
Miller beat down this bully?

424
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,760
Huge slams and grappling ground shortly.
Some nissions.

425
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,230
Y'All actually, y'all abroad. I
put, I put the guy on a fill a team.

426
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,060
Phil Baroni. You used to have this.
I don't know if he still does it.

427
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,130
I hope he still does it.
If he still does it,

428
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:28,970
he's going to break some of the neck.
He does a front headlock choke,

429
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,110
but you keep your,

430
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,890
keep your belly on top of his head so
you can lift them off the ground with his

431
00:27:33,891 --> 00:27:36,980
neck. Scott Jorgensen did
that. Yeah. In the WBC,

432
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:43,070
the front sugar Lindland does it too,
right? Yeah, kind of. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of.

433
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,730
Yeah man.
And you did your Jitsu Dork to everybody.

434
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:50,550
I realize as you git through
nerded everybody right now, my bad.

435
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,840
Me and you were like,
sorry everybody that wasn't very,

436
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,920
you guys don't get that
joke. It's a technique. Yeah,

437
00:27:57,921 --> 00:28:00,110
we were totally in
descriptive. Yeah, we were.

438
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,190
We get a guy and you get your hands
locked under his Chin and then you place

439
00:28:04,191 --> 00:28:04,731
your body,

440
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:08,720
your belly over the top of the back of
his head and as you lift him up, his,

441
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,790
his neck is basically trapped against
your chest cavity. You glide. Yeah.

442
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:16,130
Your hoist him up in the air by
his fucking neck exam. Gnarly.

443
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,210
And it's very hard to stop. If a guy,
a strong guy, big strong wrestler,

444
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:25,070
it gets that shit locked up backwards row.
Just go like this.

445
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:29,930
It's nasty. It's nasty. Oh
Man. I'm sorry. Vicious choke.

446
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,140
Last time he was Chris

447
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,330
called him Chris and then he was Chris
on the message board for like weeks

448
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,120
afterwards. People just kept fucking
torture going. I'm calling him Chris,

449
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:52,190
Chris American. I'm Kristy. Let's
play. Nice. Nice. Mr. Miller.

450
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,340
So when when you do that show,

451
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:00,020
I mean without giving away too
much of how the show is done mean,

452
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,590
that episode was amazing
again,

453
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:05,200
and I'll tweet it back at right there.

454
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,230
We'll fucking do a double
tweet background. I mean,
I had never been so happy.

455
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:12,950
That was like one of the most happiest
was that it was the question like how

456
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:16,040
much is that coached? Is that
kid just being a Douchey, his,

457
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:20,420
that's his douchey self. Is that
real dude? It's totally real. We can,

458
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:24,260
nobody tells him, listen to this, ham
it up for the camera. We could go,

459
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,950
let's we're,
we're beating up mentally disabled people.

460
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,300
Oh Man, God. Are these guys that are
just, you know, they're just super calm,

461
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,490
knucklehead, knucklehead.
No Grad on the block. Right.

462
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,960
What's show this kid?
This kid who got in there with you?

463
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:45,640
This kid has no martial arts experience.

464
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:49,180
The best part about the whole thing is
that the guy called me out too and I was

465
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:51,700
like, man, what a coincidence.
I was like, hey buddy,

466
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:56,110
what a coincidence that you and your next
bro. And I'm like I'm next. I'm like,

467
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:56,921
yeah I have next.

468
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,680
Because there's nobody in front of
me cause you know he doesn't know.

469
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:03,340
He doesn't know that it's me and I like
busted out man. It's a great episode.

470
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:06,040
It's like I watched it.
They oh you did? Yeah. Yeah.

471
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:10,480
I watched it at tiger in a mouse.
Beat the fuck out of that kid.

472
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,500
But people don't know is
you are being very nice,

473
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,680
very nice surgical surgical, surgical
like I was like, all right, here it comes.

474
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,870
I'm going to just get,
even when you punched and kicked him,

475
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,100
I could see you were in kicking him
that hard one. Good one. One good one.

476
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:28,660
And that was it.
I knew I go knock,

477
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,270
you're not going to hurt him real
bad if he just kicked his leg.

478
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,290
Oh my leg by the enemy. He
was like, okay, I'm over this.

479
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:39,370
I hit him with a body kick cause I would
stop them. The first thing I did. Yeah.

480
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,570
Yeah.
I paid him with a body kick.

481
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:44,020
I just let them come in and kick and
you didn't even hit him that hard.

482
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,860
You'll sweat the Shin pads
on too. I'm like, man, come
on beard. I was like, really?

483
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,600
It's kind of crazy though that you could
ever get in a situation where a kid

484
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:57,660
who's just some punk bullied kid could
ever get into a situation where he's on

485
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,480
television and he's fighting.
Well, well you to America.

486
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,260
What a fucking quit who
sanctions this shit.

487
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,860
Who says this is okay? It's cause
it's, it's a sparring session.

488
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:10,800
Is that what it is?
We're in sparring gear.

489
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,010
You easily could have been the strike
force champion you if you had 10 more

490
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:17,760
seconds in that round
three. I say three. Really?

491
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,520
You think you haven't had a dark,
it was his, he was turning purple,

492
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:23,260
the whole deal. I mean, so, okay,

493
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,130
you could have potentially been a world
champion and you're allowed to just get

494
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:30,160
in there and beat the fuck out of
some kid who's never really sparred,

495
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:34,840
never really fought before,
never competed. It was beautiful.

496
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:39,280
Poor fuck that kid,
that kid, he might just,

497
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,880
I feel like there's some
professional turning to a gay
hooker now. He might just,

498
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:45,970
you know what I'm saying? I mean, when
somebody just a trainee hutches you,

499
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,590
I think you'd be the hottest trend
he might have. So little self esteem,

500
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,450
you want to just start,
just give up on lack.

501
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:55,060
Come on where America should
would devastate you. Dude,

502
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,390
I saw you on your young man.
You think you're the shit.
Sorry. You're a young man.

503
00:31:58,391 --> 00:31:58,900
You think you're,

504
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,660
you're the shit and you know you're
an asshole and you're an asshole.

505
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:05,170
Then on television and these guys here,
he's really an asshole to those guys.

506
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,250
That wasn't bullshit. If he, if he, if,
if this guy grows from, from it, right.

507
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,720
Well there you go. I'm doing the service.
If he grows from it, it seems like, yeah,

508
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:20,140
it's like gross or it's going to kill you.
You get to option. Yeah. I mean, yeah,

509
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,530
he's turned to say that one of my
contestants going to go jump off a bridge

510
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:25,570
because we got beat up on MTV,
the bully beat downs.

511
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,200
Douche bags are in utter pain and that's
why their dues Deuce, of course, any big,

512
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,500
huge devastating thing like
this could go one or two ways.

513
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,260
They can either learn from it and grow
from it and realize they were being a

514
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:42,670
shithead or they just become devastated.
Oh my God,

515
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,290
I hit the rock so I can
be depressed about my job.

516
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:48,530
Joe Rogan at the rocks like this.
Boom. That's just life, right?

517
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,290
You think you're going to jump off and
do a harbor of some sort and the boat,

518
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,110
a speedboat, you're headed towards
the cliff bar slowing down.

519
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:57,831
I think it's gonna happen.

520
00:32:57,831 --> 00:33:01,070
I think it's that kick guys going to go
and beat the fuck out of those two guys

521
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:02,050
that put on this show now.

522
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,850
I think he's going to be a super bowling
now and he's going to hate them even

523
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:06,320
more.
And fucking steel man.

524
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,680
Fight him in age to the death with a tire
iron and a trash can lid as a shield.

525
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,550
Wow. You thought this out. So tell her,

526
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,310
would you have like one of those
leather straps? Are you kidding me?

527
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:22,100
Why the hell not like I don't
want to hold the trashcan.

528
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,770
Customize that to cover it around here.
Actually. Maybe we could do like pipes,

529
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,930
like pipes. Like they look cool. You know,

530
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,340
like isn't it crazy that just a thousand
years ago that's how they were rocking

531
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,610
bro. They had a shield and a sword and
that's how you took over a town. Yeah.

532
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,370
Fucking a man.
Could you imagine?

533
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:43,340
I'm just trying to think what some towels
in years. I'm just trying to, yeah,

534
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,770
just trying to mind your own business.
Just chilling,

535
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:49,880
hanging out with your wife and kids and
you see over the horizon a group of men

536
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:51,380
with swords and shields.

537
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,430
You like these mother fuckers and
they're just going to come and everybody,

538
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:59,250
they don't know they're going to fuck
or kill. What is it going to be fucker.

539
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,290
Kill fucker. Kill Fucker, kill
fucker. Kill, fuck. Then kill,

540
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,390
killed and fuck. That's the whole
deal. I think it's fucked up.

541
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:08,900
No matter who's coming over the hill.

542
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:11,840
Trying to fuck her is amazing that
people didn't just catch suicide.

543
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,430
What back then?
It's put the live down here.

544
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,220
Medieval days when people are hacking
each other with swords. It's amazing.

545
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:21,440
People didn't say, she said, I'm just
going to jump off a fucking cliff.

546
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:23,680
Life sucks. This is
ridiculous. Everywhere we go.

547
00:34:23,681 --> 00:34:27,520
He's talking about a barbarians coming
over the hills with axes and Troy like

548
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:31,460
that happen all the time. What happened
from one side of every, you know,

549
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:35,360
16 weeks like you wouldn't like,
you know, you just fucking leave.

550
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,780
You just leave. Yeah. You just
leave. You're like whatever.

551
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:43,400
All those fucking lies Gingiss con
killed. They're just lazy. Yeah.

552
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,210
They just laying around. I should have
got out of there. That's business, Bro.

553
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:48,350
Everybody is going to die.

554
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,740
I'd rather get hacked up by barbarians
then fucking go out the way.

555
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:53,810
I'm probably going to go out.
Shit, whoa. Wait a minute.

556
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,160
How are you planning on going out?

557
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,620
How are you planning on going out at
it's worst than getting hacked up by

558
00:34:57,621 --> 00:35:01,740
barbarians. Did you talk
to Dr Phil About? Yeah,

559
00:35:01,741 --> 00:35:05,060
if you like whatever bro,
though we're not worse ways to die.

560
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,290
That's right up there. No way, Bro. You
just be like, oh shit. And then dead.

561
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,800
Maybe not. Maybe they gut you.
Maybe they hang you by your ankles,

562
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,040
but I would fight the guy for sure. They
would have to fucking kill me. Okay.

563
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,820
I'm fighting them back or I
hear you right? You wouldn't
find a backup. Love them.

564
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:23,600
You might get a company like sword.
It doesn't mean you can do, fuck it.

565
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,560
I'll double leg the dude and then fucking
steal the sword right off his fucking

566
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:30,050
back of his horse. Man. I
already thought about this.

567
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,390
Tackle the dude off of his horse,

568
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,120
then fucking grabbed his sword
and just take out as many I can.

569
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,490
Hopefully it will be a Jackie Chan
seat, but if not, fuck it. Whatever.

570
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:42,810
I'll just go out. Fuck. Ahmed's.
Aw, you hack my arm off. Fuck.

571
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,600
What'd you have a different strategy
of a dude had a double edge sword or a

572
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,670
single edged sword? Yeah,
you would look at him.

573
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:49,920
You say the single edged sword
as he's kind of fucked. I would,

574
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,320
I would try to make an
assessment as much as possible,

575
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:56,580
but if they're just coming,
they're coming. Ah Man. I
hit your microphone. Men.

576
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:59,150
This fucking bunker. It's fallen
apart. Harold. Let me fix that.

577
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,870
Let's play fuck wrong with it.

578
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,760
I think you just keep hitting
it. Nah Man. Oh, hello. Hi.

579
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,030
Anyway,
what to hell with the top barbarian.

580
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,620
Fucking what a strange conversation
that is. A Dude's always have.

581
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,940
If a guy was Coleman to Judah saw Jerry.

582
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,230
I know we're totally tuning
out right now. Yeah, Yo Bro.

583
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:25,680
You know what a bear could fuck of.
Definitely kill a walrus.

584
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,300
So quick dose.

585
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:30,930
The best though when there's
instructionals online were
due to defending against

586
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:35,910
swords. It attacks you sometimes.
You've got to worry about that.

587
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:39,000
When I was a kid, I was like always
the reading of karate magazines. Like,

588
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,660
why would you have to find a dude with
a knife? I'm like, damn, that sucks.

589
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:47,010
And if he, I figured the guy
already knows if you're getting Fab,

590
00:36:47,011 --> 00:36:51,900
the DJ is going to stab you anyway. Right,
right. He has no, you know what I mean?

591
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:54,930
Like if you ha, if you have the
it, he's not going to show you.

592
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:56,750
That would be the best way
to get fat and let you know.

593
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,130
No one's going to come at you like,
well, maybe if the Rottie Trenton,

594
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:00,630
you then want,
I'll show it to you,

595
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,420
but you know that now you have
to jump and do the dishonor.

596
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,500
Most people will stab you.

597
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:06,690
They didn't even want you to know
they're going to stab you. Right.

598
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,880
They tried to sneak in on you.
Like what does racism,

599
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,260
a little racist Britain band.

600
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:16,560
Why isn't that amazing that just saying
noises like that could be racist if you

601
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:18,450
said that. What'd you
say? Ping. Ping Chong. No,

602
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:23,451
I just said Ding Dong Chin and Char Val
Asian person from the 1950 [inaudible]

603
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:27,800
movie. I know. I would never
offend Asians around man.

604
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,630
You know what's the craziest
thing in the back of the day, man,

605
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:34,660
those black and white movies, they used
to have a, what was that fucking, um,

606
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,920
there was one television show that
they used to do or a movie series.

607
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:41,670
He's stew about, uh, um, a Chinese, um,

608
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,170
detective and they had a white guy,

609
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,360
Chinese detective jeopardy. I
know, man. You're like, I am,

610
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,820
it's an old ass show. I'm sure someone
on Twitter. We'll know what it is.

611
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,240
It's an old ass show. What was
it again? It was a white dude,

612
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:01,950
but he played this Chinese detective
realize old Asian detective,

613
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,520
but it was a white dude who played it
and they had him in all this goofy,

614
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,900
it was goofy ass makeup cause it's like
1930 and shit, you know that. Yeah.

615
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:15,060
And so this, they had
this dude, nobody knew.

616
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:18,960
Asian people can't get a good factor
in that. And then you don't want to,

617
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:21,750
you know, they didn't want to give the
job to that. Charlie Chan. Thank you.

618
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,960
How did I not remember that?

619
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,650
Remember that I almost had that without
even knowing what the fuck you're

620
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:29,250
talking about. I think I blocked Charlie
out of my mind because of Jackie.

621
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:33,690
I don't want this because it was
vehicle mob. Jackie Chan, no Vietnam.

622
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,920
He didn't even know the word Charlie.

623
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,740
What the fuck is wrong with you?

624
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,440
Joe Rogan, I get back army movies, Bro.

625
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:52,690
He never played call of duty black ops.
He hasn't tried to get him to play that,

626
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,790
but Bruce Buffer,
when I was at the airport,

627
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,280
Bruce buffer was playing call of duty
while I was waiting for his plane.

628
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,820
We were in England.
He Jacks dudes with his laptop

629
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,150
and just fucking, he's getting
like diamonds on shit and his,

630
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:10,060
you know his silver distinguished hair
and he's sitting there and his Mac book

631
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,680
playing call of Duty Jack.
How did he do it with the mouse pad?

632
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,500
Now I don't know if he's moving
pretty hard. Yeah, that ain't right.

633
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,250
That belt, whatever bombing he felt. He
seemed to be doing it, you know? Yeah.

634
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,360
I got it in three d Jay, have you
play in three d yet? What? You can

635
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,340
look down the sniper thing and it looks
like it's just as huge sniper tunnel.

636
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,990
No Way. Because you have
the three d TV Too, right?

637
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:38,831
I know.

638
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:43,831
I have to bump it to both of
you had three d TV motherfucker.

639
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,500
You are a nerd. That's what a lot
of people don't know, man. You're,

640
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:49,860
you're a big time computer nerd.
I like computers. It doesn't,

641
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,040
they're fucking amazing.
I this information in a box.

642
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,540
It's something more than that,
man. It's everything. It's people.

643
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,630
The whole fucking universe is connecting
through these things. This is,

644
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,060
we're going to eventually share
one giant consciousness. Well,

645
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:08,200
it's all going to be connected
through electronics. It's what? It is.

646
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,250
Just happening. Nice and slowly
nice and slowly. It's inevitable.

647
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:15,580
It's going in that direction for sure.
All this Wiki leak shit.

648
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,000
What this wiki leaks shit
represents is a new ethic.

649
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,410
What's going on is that there's
going to be no more secrets anymore.

650
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,240
You can't have them anymore.

651
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:29,110
The exchange of information between
people is going to be at one point,

652
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:31,900
it's going to be instantaneous and
it's going to be all encompassing.

653
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:35,500
We're going to have everything
I know about you and
everything you know about me.

654
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:38,170
We going to know everything about
each other. It's just inevitable.

655
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,410
You're telling me you're going to plug
a chip into my brain and we're going to

656
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,710
blend into one thing. I'm,
I'm telling you this is,

657
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:46,570
this is without a doubt
where we're headed.

658
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,530
There's no question and talking
to everyday, well obviously, look,

659
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:55,030
if something happens like an asteroid
or a tsunami and each other up for sure.

660
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,900
I was talking to my manager the other day,
my business manager Matt,

661
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,540
who's a great guy and he's
just not a conspiracy theorist.

662
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,480
He's a real level headed
dude. And uh, he lives in a,

663
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,140
I don't want to say where he lives,
but I said,

664
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:06,970
do you ever think about
living near the ocean?

665
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,910
You ever think about getting like a
place like on the water that may kind of

666
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:11,380
dope? And he goes, yeah,

667
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:15,370
but I think about tsunamis
and I'm like, wow. Yeah,

668
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:18,820
you should think about tsunamis. Fuck, we
all should think about tsunamis, right?

669
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,290
At any point in time,

670
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,040
the earth could just decide
to move a little bit and well,

671
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:29,041
a mile high wall of water heads towards
Los Angeles like that Shit's real man.

672
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:32,350
That could happen or we
get hit by an asteroid.

673
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:37,380
Something falls the ocean and a mile
high wall of water heads towards Los

674
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,910
Angeles and he's not fucking imagine.
Could you imagine?

675
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:46,190
It's part of the charm of the
city. Yeah. If you're going to die,

676
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:49,820
it might be the only child. Every time
I'm in a parking garage in Los Angeles,

677
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,210
you live in the fucking top of
a god Damn Mountain. Absolutely.

678
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,610
You live him. I had to drive all the way
up a mountain because you're worried.

679
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,350
You're lucky. I don't
live in Colorado, Bro.

680
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,390
We don't want to be seen
each other when I come to la.

681
00:42:02,391 --> 00:42:06,830
If it wasn't for my wife getting pregnant,
I'd still be in Colorado. All of water,

682
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,060
dude. I worry about everything.
I'm a fucking freak. I
worry about meteor impacts.

683
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:14,830
I worry about the shifting of the polar
ice caps are worried about pollution or

684
00:42:14,831 --> 00:42:16,120
you should go about war.

685
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,150
You should go downhill mountain biking
because that's going to fix something.

686
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,770
I think it needs to go skiing
now, bro. Well, I would,

687
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:25,610
except by watching a detailed report
on TV where a lady who was downhill

688
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:29,540
mountain biking got attacked by a
fucking mountain lion who ate her head,

689
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,600
pulled her, don't do it.
Hold on. I like a cool way.

690
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,530
Her friend was still low mountain land
with a stick as it was dragging her

691
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:37,430
screaming,

692
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:41,540
bleeding friend with her face torn off
into the bushes and he's beating with a

693
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:46,400
stick. So what's the, saw that
lady on TV, man. And I'm like,

694
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:50,990
I don't think I'll be mountain biking,
but it could have shit.

695
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:55,820
So that's it happened to you. That's,
yeah. That's hilarious. You should go.

696
00:42:55,821 --> 00:42:59,960
You should do something outside your
comfort zone, bro. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

697
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:04,850
But I'm not comfortable with anything
that's, I'm, oh, you're not water boat.

698
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,580
What do I need to do that's outside
of my comfort zone? Tell me master.

699
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:12,860
I just feel like why you don't be scared
of life bro. No, I'm Alyson on my behalf.

700
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,920
Fucking around. I would totally
know you're making me nervous.

701
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:16,941
I'd have fuck around.

702
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:19,870
But you know my dog was eaten by a
mountain lion and I saw the mountain line.

703
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:23,870
Wait, so you think there's some
mountain line with like how to get him

704
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:33,380
to say it? They have, I have
personal experience with them.

705
00:43:33,381 --> 00:43:36,320
I know that they're dangerous as fuck.
If you're going to go,

706
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:38,990
if you're going to go around here,
you gotta run into mountain lions.

707
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,630
You can whatever,

708
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:45,020
whatever percentage wise
or you'll probably be okay.

709
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:48,590
I would fight them for a minute. Oh you'll
be fine. You know you know what to do.

710
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:53,030
But a girl on a fucking bike in very rare,
very rare.

711
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:55,070
They don't fuck with men.
They have killed women.

712
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,950
They killed a 19 year old girl
last year in Canada singer.

713
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,520
He's just a recording contract
of the period. Bullshit.

714
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:10,040
He wasn't even trying to be funny.
That's cause he's got an animal's mind.

715
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,050
May Have Nice animal
minds thinking about it.

716
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:17,240
He's just thinking about it. That's
what I would smell it. Smell her,

717
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,690
my period blood be smelling that shit.
I'm, I think I'm going to eat this.

718
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,510
I get all my girlfriends, bro. Yeah, man.

719
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,970
The kid getting killed by
wolves is pretty rare too.

720
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:28,010
We've talked about that
recently on the podcast yet.

721
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,590
I didn't know that wolves have killed
people as recently as this year. Yeah.

722
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,480
If you'd like,
you're a woman,

723
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:38,120
you're a food source and you're in
their little sector by yourself. Oh,

724
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,830
you're fucked up. Isn't it weird
that we have this weird thing with,

725
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:43,110
with wolves where you know it used to be,

726
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,820
everyone was aware that wolves were
really dangerous. You, we went backwards.

727
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,320
We went backwards because wolves are we,
we've dumbed down the wolf.

728
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,130
What do you mean fuck them up so hardcore
that we feel bad that we fucked him up,

729
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,580
but the reason we fucked them up is
cause wolves were eating babies and shit.

730
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,880
Yeah. They're eating people.
Wolves, eating people.

731
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:06,390
Before there was a kid in 2005 I got
eaten by a wolf and it was this woman that

732
00:45:06,391 --> 00:45:08,570
got killed by a wolf.
This here take fucking kill pain.

733
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:10,950
So I take it you like don't
go camping or anything, Dude.

734
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:14,940
I've been camping once and a bear attacked
our cooler. Walked all of our car,

735
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:18,810
tore our cooler to shreds.
Fascinated to get eaten by animals.

736
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,940
Fucking do it. So should I go with it? Go.

737
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:26,310
Australia should do to die
by ostrich. Pite bro. You may

738
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,480
just need to turn off the mask.
Every channel at your house.

739
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:34,530
That would be embarrassing, man.
For all my friends. How'd he die?

740
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:39,170
Fucking ostrich kicked his
ass. Ate them. Right? Fuck.

741
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,220
He was covered. If they kick you,
you're fucked. Oh, of course.

742
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,190
Your guts will fall out of
that giant powerful legs. Man.

743
00:45:48,191 --> 00:45:50,700
You watched way too much documentary.
I know.

744
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,630
I just got a whole new box set.

745
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:59,980
Like your leftovers or some shit.
No,

746
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,480
I just know, I don't mean turned me
out like I don't want to buy it myself.

747
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:05,200
Just keep them. Let me borrow some. I'll
give you some DVDs. I got some shit for,

748
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,170
I got some interesting stuff.
You should switch to cartoons for a year.

749
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:11,940
I can't do it dude. I can't do it. I, you
know, this is what I do. Okay, I'll go,

750
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:15,260
I'll go through my DVR.
I'll see like a watch HD net fights.

751
00:46:15,261 --> 00:46:18,510
I watch like I looked at Anthony Bordain,
no reservation show.

752
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,440
I see if there's any boxing matches that
I missed and then I just go straight to

753
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:23,820
all the space shows.

754
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:27,660
It's all the universe or it's all like
some crazy shit on the science channel.

755
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,180
That's the only thing that's
interesting to me. This is the,

756
00:46:30,181 --> 00:46:35,160
I can't watch shows like a drama
or a Sitcom. I can't do it. I just,

757
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:37,380
I can't do it and I'll watch it
for five minutes. I'll just go,

758
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,090
oh you know,
every now and then like breaking bad,

759
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:45,000
like a watch, like a cool drama.
Those are fun if you like.

760
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,970
When I was getting tattooed,
I was watching breaking bad.

761
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,470
I can watch like a bunch of APP.

762
00:46:49,471 --> 00:46:53,340
I watch like two seasons of it's always
sunny in Philadelphia. Is that good?

763
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,970
What's that? One of the best
shows ever? I think so man.

764
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:01,770
But network is a well written FX,
FX,

765
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,320
FX, FX, FX. I think it was
the same night as my show.

766
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:15,480
Really pumping up a competitor. I know.
No, I know, but I watch it. It's like,

767
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:18,760
it's like my shows on and then you can
take the gentlemen bear show, antique.

768
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,550
We live in Tivo.
Lamb not competing with any of them.

769
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,440
The only time I watch things as they're
happening. His fights. Yeah. Happy to.

770
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:30,730
If you need to know that it's that,
I mean that's just how life is,

771
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:32,720
but oh my son is really
good man. They like, they,

772
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,500
they have so many great characters
and stuff and like it's well written.

773
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,070
Did you watch the Manny Pacquiao
fight man? Yeah man. We,

774
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:42,910
my dad and a hunting trip.
It was awesome.

775
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,390
Like sit out there in the
country with lots of many backup.

776
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,000
My Dad like screaming and yelling like
for the wrong guy. Like what? Man,

777
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:52,990
let's start it. Even pack out slingbox
I watched it on my laptop in London.

778
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:57,770
Oh yeah. Yes. Cool. Corey. Damn,
that motherfucker is good. Yeah.

779
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,700
I wonder though what his style though.
You know,

780
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,550
I wonder if he could fuck with
Floyd Mayweather. No, I know.

781
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,370
That's what everybody wants. The
old don't know. I still don't know.

782
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:11,050
If you look at the way Floyd Mayweather,
the way he just handled men.

783
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:15,070
My male Marquez. Yeah. You
know one mil. One Mil men.

784
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:17,200
Well Marcus style style wise though.

785
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:20,650
I think style wise did that matches
up pretty good. Like I think I'm uh,

786
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,060
Manny matches up pretty good.

787
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,790
I think that mark has couldn't
do shit to Floyd though.

788
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:28,090
And Mark has a Mayweather went to war
and they went to war twice. Yeah, I know.

789
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,600
Boy. Just shut all that shit down.
But I'm back heals fast patio is,

790
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,260
it's pretty good. He's
fast. He moves well.

791
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:38,830
It takes a good shot and a and
and you know, uh, Mayweather got,

792
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,640
got rocked real bad by Mosley and
like that kind of showed that. Okay.

793
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,710
You can get touched too, right? I
know what I mean. So he got, yeah,

794
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,650
he got tagged real good.
That one punch.

795
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:50,500
It really kind of fucked it up for Mosley
cause he stopped boxing and started

796
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:54,200
bombing, you know, and like he
like lost his, his rhythms angry.

797
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,360
He lost his rhythm. That was a tough
fight for him. Anyway, that dude is,

798
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,090
it's amazing that like me see boxers,

799
00:49:01,091 --> 00:49:04,180
it's so strange that boxers can compete
at that higher level when they're like

800
00:49:04,181 --> 00:49:08,630
40 you know, he's like 39 right, isn't it?
It's business. Yeah. There's some some,

801
00:49:08,631 --> 00:49:12,160
I mean some guys can keep going and
some guys it just all falls apart.

802
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:15,160
It's interesting like look at
Hopkins because he's so technical.

803
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,330
40 fucking five 46 years old, still
fighting. I mean that's incredible man.

804
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,420
You know, I'm down the big
man at the end of the day,

805
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:26,050
that's what's the most important in
every combat sport. It's technique,

806
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:29,980
all that ferocity and everything. It's
so important to me. Have to have it.

807
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,470
You know, you have to have strength, you
have to have endurance, you have to have,

808
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:36,100
you know, fighter spirit. But
what's most important is technique.

809
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,980
All that other shit you can have to,
that all,

810
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:41,530
all that other shit has to be
processed through technique though.

811
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,370
And guys had just rely on one thing that
just rely on their aggressiveness or

812
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:48,610
relying on their athleticism. Like how
many times have you watch guys fight?

813
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,391
Like in,
you know,

814
00:49:49,391 --> 00:49:53,230
MMA on TV and you see like a guy
that's like super hyper aggressive,

815
00:49:53,231 --> 00:49:56,830
but yet he's got all these holes in
his standup and he's dropping his hands

816
00:49:56,831 --> 00:49:58,990
goofy and is not turning his kicks over.

817
00:49:58,991 --> 00:50:00,750
But he's just super aggressive
and that's how he's winning.

818
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:03,130
And he's getting guys by just being,
and you're like, this guy's just like,

819
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,250
eventually he's going to run
into a guy that as tough as him,

820
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:09,790
but it's technical and it's fucked.
Yeah, of course that always happens.

821
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,180
It's just the style. I was like, got
this guy's got smarter technique.

822
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:18,010
You know what I mean? That's
like the big battle, isn't
it? You know, isn't it? Yeah,

823
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,190
man. The, the, the life of martial artist,

824
00:50:21,191 --> 00:50:24,640
a professional mixed martial artist that
has got to be a trippy way to fucking

825
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:27,200
pay your bill.
So I know I,

826
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:30,590
there's been moments where I've stood
across the ring for one and I'm like,

827
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:35,910
I'm about to fight another grown man
on national television. Then I like,

828
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,820
I like,
this is my life right now.

829
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:41,420
Do you try to squash those thoughts or
you just go, well that's it is what it is.

830
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:44,340
No, whenever I just go, Ha,

831
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:49,160
I'm about to fight somebody on TV. So you
laugh. So you think it's my head? Yeah.

832
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,130
It's so weird. Like I
said, whatever, you know,

833
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:54,170
you just take a different path
in your life. You're like, oh,

834
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:57,830
this is what I'm doing. You know?
It's, I don't know. It's very strange.

835
00:50:57,831 --> 00:51:01,550
It's very different. But, but I mean, you
know, it's just my job. Like I just like,

836
00:51:01,551 --> 00:51:05,180
this is what I'm good at to do crazy
ass way to make a living son. Yep.

837
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:09,530
That's a crazy ass way
business so fast.

838
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,200
Don't cry for me, Bro. What are
you talking about? I'm not crying.

839
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:15,810
We're just talking. I know. That's what
I mean. My life is to other people.

840
00:51:15,811 --> 00:51:19,010
It would be horrific, you know,
getting on stage and doing comedy or,

841
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:22,980
or talking to friends. I never even
realized that, that that is like people,

842
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,210
a lot of people's number one
fear. And I'm like, what? Why?

843
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:30,480
Just don't want to be judged.
And he'd done it lately. Me? No,

844
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,480
I mean Ellis show and,
right. You know, there's,

845
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,990
there's a new place they want.

846
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:40,650
They want me to do a show on a 16 on what?

847
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:46,130
Huh? A show in the 16th yeah.
Of what? December. What can
I do it? Tow Rope? What?

848
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,010
A comedy show? Yeah. Hell yeah.
You can totally do it. I know.

849
00:51:49,011 --> 00:51:52,540
What do I talk about though? Anything,
right? A bunch of shit down 16th.

850
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:57,200
What's Today's date?
Today's the 29th Oh,

851
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,870
so you've got like how
many days are in November?

852
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,860
November 30 yeah. 30 so I've got
that long to do it. I'll say,

853
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,870
I'll say some funny shit.
Yeah. You know what?

854
00:52:07,871 --> 00:52:10,990
How much time do you have to go up
for? I don't know. I'll figure it out.

855
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:15,800
Key words I want you to use period.
Blood. Those two words. Yeah. Use those.

856
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:19,120
And coyotes.
No,

857
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,650
I'm having to use it from the, I mean, you
guys are seeing if I go, if I go up on,

858
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:28,130
on uh, the 16th, if they improv,

859
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,370
there's Hollywood punchline
period, blood period. Blood.

860
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,930
That that'll just be the punchline.
I guess girls would think about that shit.

861
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:39,700
If they got in the water to that sharks
will bite their pussy. Right. You know,

862
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,060
I mean,
my God,

863
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:45,860
could you fucking imagine the thought
and that's how you dye your hair color.

864
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,750
But the shark is going for your pussy
because he smells your period. Whoa.

865
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,850
What a horror. Someone must've died
like that. Somewhere along the line.

866
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,590
Some girl must've done not by a
shark. She must have. You're right.

867
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,453
It must've happened.

868
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,580
It was all the people that have been
killed by sharks for all the hundreds of

869
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,970
thousands of years. People have been on
this planet. My Dad had like, fuck, yeah,

870
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,430
yeah, dude, you can't get me in that
fucking water and then water can suck.

871
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:11,060
My Dick Kid just got
half in San Bernardino,

872
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,910
Santa Barbara. He wrote,
why is it so scared?

873
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,240
I'm fascinated. Nope, you're
scared though. But I'm not,

874
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:22,850
I just don't think that
getting eaten by a shark,

875
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:26,240
it's worth the thrill of surfing
bullshit, Bro. You feel me?

876
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:30,740
I don't need to sign. You don't want to
go mountain biking because it's sucking.

877
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:32,460
No,

878
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:37,460
you don't want to go surfing because the
fucking sharks or EU breaking it down.

879
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:41,820
Exactly. Okay. Yes, you
don't what the fuck?

880
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:45,030
Those are monsters and I try to
avoid monsters in my everyday life.

881
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:48,180
You don't want to go roller skating,
specially monsters in the water, man.

882
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:51,480
At least a mountain line. You might be
able to fucking get them in a guillotine.

883
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,880
You know what I'm saying?
Outline might fuck up.

884
00:53:53,881 --> 00:53:58,680
You can't dude a mountain lion my fuck up.
You might get on top. You might sprawl.

885
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:01,310
You know what I'm saying?
You might take us back.

886
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,940
You might take that mountain lions back.
Your head shucking not out in Lyons.

887
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,490
You're dark thing about loud.

888
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:14,980
Fuck out of him and his stupid fucking
dirty stinky shit covered pause. Fuck,

889
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:15,750
I'm out in line,

890
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:19,080
but a shark will eat your ass hole and
there's not much you can do about it.

891
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,930
You wait, you're bleeding out of
your ass hole. He's going to eat.

892
00:54:21,931 --> 00:54:26,510
You come up from behind so you don't even
see them common and he's just going to

893
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,040
start eating you. So what
bro? That's the risk.

894
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:32,170
We all take them living here on
mother earth. The great guy. Yeah,

895
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:33,780
that's beautiful man. I know, right?

896
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:38,460
I try to avoid being a part of the food
chain except the top part. Yeah, but no,

897
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,630
the chances that you're going to get
eaten by an animal while doing an outdoor

898
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:45,960
activity are very low.
They're way,

899
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:49,320
way higher than if you don't go to
those places where the monsters are.

900
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,790
I find that the the best way to cut down
on the possibility of getting eaten by

901
00:54:56,791 --> 00:55:00,750
monsters is to not go near the monsters.
So you're,

902
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:04,530
would you go hang gliding?
Why am I a fucking bird?

903
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,910
Listen man,
that's a dumb ass way to go.

904
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:13,740
But you go to the rocks from an
errant breeze. Oh woops. Now I'm dead.

905
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:14,320
You don't want to go.

906
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,630
He doesn't want to go hang gliding cause
he might get eaten by a pterodactyl.

907
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,910
Brian, why don't you tell him the story
about your dad and parachuting? No,

908
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,410
paragliding. Why don't you tell
the story before you even tell it.

909
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,310
But that's, you know, I bet
you know shooting paragliding

910
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:33,630
in Paris shooting. So he
jumped out the fucking thing
and die. No, no, no. His Dad,

911
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:38,580
his dad, Brian, my, My, my dad worked with
somebody that every week she was like,

912
00:55:38,581 --> 00:55:41,040
Hey, you need to come, you
know a skydiving with me.

913
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:44,310
Cause she did it every weekend and he
was like thinking about it even though he

914
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:46,560
didn't want to.
And then one day she died,

915
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:51,110
she jumped out and I guess like her
emergency parachute went with the regular

916
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:55,920
parachute. What? The devil to me that
was like out of one out of 1 million now.

917
00:55:55,921 --> 00:56:00,360
But I would never parachute. But I think
Joseph go roller skating and if not,

918
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:02,820
I'm not scared.

919
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,400
Don't be scared to Homey,

920
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:08,830
homey.com that website
for her to put like be,

921
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:13,530
don't be scared of me like a sure after
the fight that it's a good idea man.

922
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:16,340
Look, you know, think about
like what would Tyler Durden do.

923
00:56:16,341 --> 00:56:19,130
Dot Com they have a dark
side. Yeah, it's cool.

924
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:24,130
Brian's friend Brian. Ah, I want him

925
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,880
to help me. He's a fun dude, man. That
what would Tyler Durden guys WWT Dee Dee,

926
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,700
he says some funny shit,
man.

927
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:34,960
He's got some really good like one liners
on unreal things that are going on in

928
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:39,280
the news. He's a funny guy. He's
funny and he hates Paris Hilton a lot.

929
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:46,180
Uh, Paris Hilton Perez told Harriet. Yeah.
Nope, you're not Paris. Bronx parents,

930
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,390
the guy, oh no, no,
no. He hates Paris. Oh,

931
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:53,050
he ate his tweets on Paris are hilarious.
Really?

932
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,010
Why would he hate her? She just some
lost child. Why would he give a fuck?

933
00:56:57,011 --> 00:56:59,320
Because it's funny. Yeah, he does.

934
00:56:59,321 --> 00:57:02,140
He's more of a funding gap right
now to make fun of Paris Hilton.

935
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:06,410
So I'm going to again, fun. Yeah.
Just died off. Yeah, it did. Yeah.

936
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,780
It has to die off like,

937
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,870
because at a certain point in time you
become the joke for caring about her.

938
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,930
Like why are you still
talking about this one?

939
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:17,650
It was just one person out of a
river of humans. It's the next one.

940
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:18,780
The next one. The next one. Excellent.

941
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:23,470
Amazing though that people are
irrelevant to me. It's like why?

942
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:27,260
Like why do people famous? I was like,
this is kind of a fad. It's amazing.

943
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,480
Our culture. Like I feel bad for us.
Well it's bad and I started getting care.

944
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:35,260
I start Karen. Cause we other people
can like man damn it. Why do I care?

945
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:38,300
I will want to pretend that I know
what's going to happen in the future.

946
00:57:38,301 --> 00:57:39,500
Cause I obviously don't,
you know,

947
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:42,860
I don't know whether or not we're going
to pour ourselves out of this downward

948
00:57:42,861 --> 00:57:43,431
spiral,

949
00:57:43,431 --> 00:57:46,730
this humanity downward spiral with some
sort of a technological innovation or

950
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:50,630
something, you know? But I if,
if, but if it doesn't happen,

951
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,280
so I forgot what I was talking.

952
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:53,470
Man,

953
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,560
you are fucking deep in the depths
of content you're talking about.

954
00:57:57,561 --> 00:58:01,460
Before he said that Paris Hilton, Paris
Hilton, this is a quote that he did,

955
00:58:01,461 --> 00:58:04,730
Paris Hilton, everyone hates you. No
one is going to watch your dumb show.

956
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,770
No one cares anymore.
Go Kill Yourself.

957
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:12,440
That's not enough tweet ever.
It's so being that it was funny.

958
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:15,470
It was,
sorry Ari Shaffir wrote that.

959
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:18,350
Oh, this was, so, this is
what I was going to say.

960
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,770
I don't know whether or not we were
ever going to pour ourselves out of this

961
00:58:21,771 --> 00:58:24,240
downward spiral.
But if you look at,

962
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,470
like if you look at a civilization,
if you looked at a civilization like,

963
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:33,560
like right before it was going to fall
like Rome or like the Greek empire,

964
00:58:33,561 --> 00:58:37,160
like any, anywhere. All you hear
about is stem going crazy. Oh,

965
00:58:37,161 --> 00:58:40,610
you hear about his feathers and they're
eating and then the throwing up and

966
00:58:40,611 --> 00:58:44,270
they're fucking everything
and their fucking little
boys and shit and just lions

967
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:47,630
versus Christians. It's always the
craziest, craziest shit goes down.

968
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,540
And that's what everybody talks
about after it falls apart. Well,

969
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:53,240
isn't that what's happening right here?
I mean it has to be.

970
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:56,450
It's happening slowly. That's what
it is. I mean, we were talking,

971
00:58:56,451 --> 00:58:59,480
Brian and I were looking at the
pictures of the Colosseum in Rome.

972
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,350
We were having lunch at this Italian
place today and they had this photo of the

973
00:59:03,351 --> 00:59:06,920
Colosseum in Rome.
And the photo was from 2010 right.

974
00:59:06,921 --> 00:59:11,090
So the Colosseum was this fucking
incredible old piece of architecture where

975
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:14,300
people fought fucking lions right
there in the center of that pitch.

976
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,120
And there's cars just driving
around it and the cars,

977
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:22,010
the distance between the curb and the
fucking walls of this insane building is

978
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:26,690
what, 15 feet, 10 feet. It's like
there's no space. It's like car,

979
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:30,610
this insane old building
paper pry.

980
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:35,140
That shit just fell apart. It fell
apart and nobody fixed it. Yeah,

981
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:40,160
it just fell right apart. That can
easily happen with us and if it does,

982
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:44,070
they're going to be talking about us
the same way we talk about the Roman.

983
00:59:44,071 --> 00:59:46,370
So mountain biking, it would
be allowing by, he's crazy.

984
00:59:46,371 --> 00:59:49,760
Assholes had TV shows where
regular people became famous.

985
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:53,570
Girls became famous because
they were showing their
pussies. They get other cars,

986
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,460
like how many,
how many girls ever came famous,

987
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:00,410
like we're big or got massive publicity
for showing their pussy on TV or showing

988
01:00:00,411 --> 01:00:03,110
their pussy rather a
publicity for these magazines.

989
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:08,270
How many times that happened and
so 14,000 that would be something.

990
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,310
I think that's more incorrect.

991
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:14,720
I think 14 maybe 40 14
girls are shown there.

992
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:17,690
Person Pretend said they've
accidentally show them pushing.

993
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,900
You think it's for a lot of them are
probably researched having not that many.

994
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,160
Probably like fifth.
No.

995
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:24,380
Probably the point is that's going to be
something they would talk about in the

996
01:00:24,381 --> 01:00:26,510
future when they study ancient history.

997
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,850
I talk about the fall
of the American empire.

998
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,970
What are they going to talk about it?
They're gonna talk about how nutty we,

999
01:00:30,971 --> 01:00:32,750
where the girls would
just show their pussies.

1000
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:37,640
Girls became famous for leaking sex tapes.
Just fucking sucking cock.

1001
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:43,280
I Kim Kardashians. She got famous hanging
out with a girl who should have been,

1002
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,960
should have been, you know, there's,

1003
01:00:44,961 --> 01:00:47,780
it should have been no reason for Paris
Hilton become famous. Why was she famous?

1004
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:50,840
While she just figured out how to
do it. Don't hate. There she is,

1005
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,630
and so Kim Kardashians was hanging
out with her and goes, you know what?

1006
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,600
I got to kick this up a notch.
I'm going to do a porno with a black guy,

1007
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,400
so she does a poor, know what this dude,
she sucks his deck. Fuck some everything.

1008
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,690
It's all real legit porno and then it's
like, oh, how did that get out there?

1009
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:10,370
Dinette and then that becomes a huge hit
show and then she becomes a mainstream

1010
01:01:10,371 --> 01:01:12,260
celebrity on the cover
of almost every magazine.

1011
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,560
Every God damn time I go
to the magazine stand.

1012
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:17,600
Her face is on the cover of some magazine,

1013
01:01:17,601 --> 01:01:21,680
whether it's a fitness magazine
or anything. It's amazing. It's,

1014
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,840
that would be something that
people would look at and say,

1015
01:01:23,841 --> 01:01:27,020
look how crazy they got.
They just made regular people like,

1016
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:29,060
you don't have to sing, you don't have
to dance, you don't have to write,

1017
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:32,030
you don't have to. Or she has
curriculum. She's got an ass,

1018
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:35,940
she's got an ass and she
has some charisma. I've met
some charisma. I meant me.

1019
01:01:35,941 --> 01:01:39,090
It meant to ass. So
yeah. No, I don't know.

1020
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:42,170
Don't you think that if you were looking
at a culture, if people like, I know.

1021
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:45,740
Yeah. If you looked at it
for, for the future, that's
what you would say. You'd say,

1022
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:46,760
look at these crazy assholes.

1023
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:50,510
Maybe some people are just going to have
the charisma and then all of a sudden

1024
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,750
they're going to be awesome. Like I
don't think we're on the same track.

1025
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,100
Everybody will you guys met?
Maybe Christine,

1026
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,360
how about everybody will just be famous
and we'll all like always we just

1027
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:03,460
connected the two things.

1028
01:02:03,461 --> 01:02:06,500
I doubt that's what I was just thinking
that everybody has a computer chip in

1029
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:08,420
their brain and then
you walk up this guy go,

1030
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:12,320
oh he's awesome and then everyone
will just shine in a magical land.

1031
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:13,680
Well I think eventually you're,

1032
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,390
everyone's should have your phone
number will be like a channel. You know?

1033
01:02:17,391 --> 01:02:20,040
You will have like right to
the brain like ah Bro, let me

1034
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,310
get your channel number cause I really
want to dance around in your head. Right.

1035
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,490
That's real. That'll be right before
the final, the final immersion.

1036
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,310
That's what we'd be the last final
immersion. I'm like, God, I don't even,

1037
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:30,420
immersion is no,

1038
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:34,950
no consciousness other than
the one everybody together
to get all linked up like

1039
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:38,790
a matrix right now. That's what's going
to happen. No emotion, no bullshit,

1040
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:40,020
no negativity,

1041
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:44,430
just all we're going to be and then we're
going to find ourselves back all the

1042
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:48,690
way through the universe back in time
to, Oh man, you're freaking me out.

1043
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,260
That's ultimate stoner talk.
There's no more ultimate stoner talk.

1044
01:02:55,261 --> 01:03:00,261
Then what happens when you die or future
aliens and the future and what's going

1045
01:03:01,271 --> 01:03:04,530
to happen, man, when's it kit man,

1046
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:11,670
I'm a fucking fool. All I do all day
is not even think about the moment.

1047
01:03:11,671 --> 01:03:15,480
Just worry constantly about what is
going to happen in the future. Man.

1048
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:16,140
I'm getting,

1049
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:21,140
I feel like you guys are
huddle therapeutic just to me.

1050
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:25,090
It's all just fascinating.
It's all hyping Dr Phil,

1051
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:30,960
how is that you got any secrets at the
doctor Phil? I don't know doctor Phil was.

1052
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:34,530
I was like, Damn. That was just, it was
weird as like me getting ready to fight,

1053
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:36,750
like I'm like man, but a fight a man, man,

1054
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:41,220
I'm about to go on a doctor Phil show
like got paid where? Ah, I was just like,

1055
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:44,700
this is so weird. But I was nervous. I
was just like, what the hell am I doing?

1056
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:46,800
This is give you a massage or anything.

1057
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:49,560
Is there any things that he did when
the cameras are off to touch his head,

1058
01:03:49,561 --> 01:03:52,980
but you know that's disrespectful,
right? And I mean just to say I did it.

1059
01:03:52,981 --> 01:03:57,330
You know what guy, what was he like
as a nice dude? Doctor feels cool

1060
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:02,250
and no yet no, he had a weight
lifter hand grip. Really? Yeah,

1061
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:07,050
I'm a little bit, I was like, hey
man, doctor Phil's kind of buff.

1062
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:09,420
Wow. I swear. I was like, really? Yeah,

1063
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:12,570
he played football in high
school and for sure the college,

1064
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,020
maybe you hang it if Dr Phil
called you up. Hey Jason,

1065
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:19,350
I'm down here at the bar
thinking about getting a beer.

1066
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:23,270
Would you like to join me?
I will walk you [inaudible].

1067
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,560
I'd like to talk to the doctor.
Phil, what would you do it?

1068
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,080
We'll just start talking pussy man.

1069
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,010
Let's cut the bullshit.

1070
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:38,100
I should feel just start
talking crazy pussy stories.

1071
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,900
But before I was married,

1072
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:44,400
I remember when I was supposed to be on
that doctor Phil show or the doctors and

1073
01:04:44,401 --> 01:04:47,910
you talked me out of it. What
was it about for Salvia? Oh yeah,

1074
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:52,420
and they're going to show my video and
everything. I told him don't be going off.

1075
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,850
You're going to do,
first of all,

1076
01:04:53,851 --> 01:04:57,600
that's going to contribute to the
end of that salvage. Right. I know.

1077
01:04:57,601 --> 01:05:02,360
That's what I was, shit, that shit is
so fragile. He legal. It's not legal.

1078
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:05,350
It's still legal in California. I'm
pretty sure. I thought it wasn't.

1079
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:07,740
Some states it's legal
in some states still.

1080
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,650
Some states made it illegal and I think
they just made it illegal in Florida.

1081
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:13,500
That's it hurt anybody,
man.

1082
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:16,460
This is why it's weird that they're
making it illegal. Look the all the,

1083
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:17,980
the problem is it's sort of

1084
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,560
a guilt by association thing
because if you consider it,

1085
01:05:20,561 --> 01:05:23,620
and even though you look at those
statistics and there's no deaths in,

1086
01:05:23,621 --> 01:05:27,340
is no immediate danger, you know, health
wise. Like why should it be illegal? Well,

1087
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:29,380
because it's like all this
other shit that's illegal.

1088
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:33,370
Salvia is one of the most potent
psychedelic drugs in the world and it's

1089
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:37,120
available at headshops whereas,
you know, it's really hard target.

1090
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:41,200
What are you talking about?
They sell sadly at target
too. They really plants. Oh,

1091
01:05:41,201 --> 01:05:45,790
Salvia plants. Yeah. That's
pretty tripping. Yeah, you're
right. It's sage, right?

1092
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:50,040
I mean that's what Salvia
is. Oh yeah, yeah. Well this,

1093
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,600
I don't know if it's the same strain.
I want to know what it is,

1094
01:05:53,601 --> 01:05:57,130
is they extract it, you know, and then
condense it down and they extract it.

1095
01:05:57,131 --> 01:05:59,680
So you get like Salvia time 60 you know,

1096
01:05:59,681 --> 01:06:03,580
so it's like there's little condensed
former con cannot condensed or whatever.

1097
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:07,330
And then you wait. Can you put that in
your coffee? I know it's like an herb.

1098
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:09,670
It's like weed and you have to get
put that in your pipe and smoke it.

1099
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:12,940
You get this light or that you have to
have one of the crack lighters with the

1100
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:16,960
blue torches and it gets it
up to a certain temperature
and it releases a pretty

1101
01:06:16,961 --> 01:06:21,580
much, it was like a whippet of mushrooms,
you know, you're just doing, Oh God,

1102
01:06:21,581 --> 01:06:25,000
I'm sure Megan. Oh my God, my face is on
fire and melting. Uh, I'm dead. Oh Hey,

1103
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:28,720
I'm back. But the problem is this,
kids were doing this, you know,

1104
01:06:28,721 --> 01:06:30,970
and 50 times a day,
many times a day. Right.

1105
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,580
Making the most hilarious
youtube videos in the rural.

1106
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:37,420
If you ever want to see some of the
funniest shit, just go on youtube.

1107
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:41,980
Type in Salvia, the kid and the kid.
Yeah. Kids doing all that shit. Yeah,

1108
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:46,880
exactly. Or all right. Or,
or it's a question of it.

1109
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:52,290
I'd never kind of seizures like a seizure.
Seizures.

1110
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:56,870
Decent. That's good. Caesar.
I told the story about, uh,

1111
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,260
or told them before what I used to have.
My friend Johnny,

1112
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,120
his girlfriend used to fake seizures.
Why did the grocery wanted to it so bad?

1113
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:05,260
She was to fig seizures.

1114
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,930
She would fall down and like
fake a seizure and he would,

1115
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,760
he would use it as an excuse to slap in
the face. He was like, honey, wake up,

1116
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:16,030
wake up, wake up. And I'd see
like you like bite his lip.

1117
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:19,750
I was hitting it like fucking bitch like
you like really like give her slaps in

1118
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:23,790
the face. That's the most healthy
relationship. I don't remember.

1119
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:24,910
No chaos.

1120
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:29,890
That's the most amazing thing about
knowing a lot of fucked up people.

1121
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:33,310
You know what is everyone's like,
you have a story like that.

1122
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:38,140
It puts it all in perspective too. You
realize there's, there's a man, my girl,

1123
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:38,941
fuck me.

1124
01:07:38,941 --> 01:07:43,270
She's not faking features in a fucking
grocery store or you have to slap the

1125
01:07:43,271 --> 01:07:46,950
shit out of her in front of everybody.
That's the saddest thing ever. Pretty,

1126
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:50,080
pretty Goddamn damn ridicule. You got
this chick's number or what? She's done.

1127
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:55,100
Damn. She's dead. She deserves
to be. Wow. She's dead.

1128
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:59,040
I don't know if she's dead. He's
dead though. Aw, poor bastard. Yeah.

1129
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,650
It was my best friend.
Fascinating dude. Yeah.

1130
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:05,890
Hung out with a lot of crazy bitches.
Yeah. You know, that could get easy to do,

1131
01:08:05,891 --> 01:08:08,440
man,
because you know a chicken is beautiful.

1132
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:12,820
She's banana sandwich and you don't care
either because once you start having

1133
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:16,130
sex with them, you're like,
ah, what am I doing right now?

1134
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,190
Problem with dues is once
you start having sex with it,

1135
01:08:18,191 --> 01:08:22,550
if it's good and they're hot, where
you have sex and do what you just said.

1136
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:25,880
No, no, no, no. Listen, listen to me.

1137
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,670
The problem with us,

1138
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:34,220
when you have sex with a girl and
she's hot, you get addicted to it.

1139
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:38,090
You got one and she's super hot and
she's sexy and she's got a killer body.

1140
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,790
You're like, you could get that again.
You could always get that again.

1141
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:45,650
So even if she's crazy, you start
going, oh fuck you want all right. Well,

1142
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:48,020
I dunno. Okay, what are you doing?
You want to go out tomorrow?

1143
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,660
And then next thing you know,
you're, you're fucking her again.

1144
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,380
And next thing you know,
this is your girlfriend is crazy bitches,

1145
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:56,440
your girlfriend. And just because she's
hot and she's got a good, you know,

1146
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,180
I know she's afraid and the crazy ones,

1147
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:01,700
a lot of times they're more fun
in bed because they want them.

1148
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,590
They want to please you.
They want to,

1149
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,580
you know they really want you to be
rocked so they'll freak you out more and

1150
01:09:07,581 --> 01:09:10,230
then you're even extra stuck.
Right.

1151
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:13,370
Cause if you get used to that
you get used to with my friend.

1152
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:17,960
Tony always says that erotic and
psychotic or like they're like next door

1153
01:09:17,961 --> 01:09:19,490
neighbors.
What are you doing over there Brian?

1154
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,590
He was looking for something to
drink so I gave him some check.

1155
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:26,300
Do you want another coconut
drink? Yeah. Thanks dude.

1156
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,240
You're like the best intern ever joke.

1157
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:34,460
I like he's wearing a paper
boy cap too man. I know

1158
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,870
man. You need like one index.
It like us Joe Rogan call.

1159
01:09:44,871 --> 01:09:47,280
That's one of the best ones.
Regular water.

1160
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:53,000
Regular water on their debit bro. That's
all right. You know what? I've just been,

1161
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,560
I was drinking out of the
think I like to do it.

1162
01:09:54,561 --> 01:09:58,240
Old School like that's
his jerk off sync though.

1163
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:00,830
He got to jerk off.
Yeah.

1164
01:10:00,831 --> 01:10:03,230
He puts his dick underneath the
sink and it drops the water on it.

1165
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:07,520
Like a girl doesn't have bathtub. What?
Have you ever heard of girls that do that?

1166
01:10:07,521 --> 01:10:07,881
That,
that,

1167
01:10:07,881 --> 01:10:11,330
that masturbate by like putting their
pussy right underneath the faucet and they

1168
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:14,360
just slowly taught. That's gotta
be a benefit of being a chick.

1169
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,470
Must be way easier to masturbate. Open
wound. Yeah, totally. Do you think so?

1170
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:23,570
I don't know man. I got her this letter
like our Modi stick stuff in there. Yeah,

1171
01:10:23,571 --> 01:10:27,680
they're allowed to. Ah, ah.

1172
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,750
If a girl gets used to that,
that's the real problem.

1173
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:32,900
She gets used to a vibrator or some
girls get broken, they're pussies.

1174
01:10:32,901 --> 01:10:36,560
Just get broken to regular fiber
stimulation over sensitized.

1175
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:40,770
That happens a lot more than than,
than I thought I did actually.

1176
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:44,300
They got to cycle off like, yeah. Yeah.

1177
01:10:44,301 --> 01:10:47,240
You stopped like stop doing coffee for
a while and then all of a sudden you're

1178
01:10:47,241 --> 01:10:51,730
like, drink a coffee. You're
like, Oh yeah, I'm fricking
pumps. True. Right. Yeah.

1179
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:55,010
Big Difference. You just stop.
You stop. The weirdest thing.

1180
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:59,060
I know what I'm drinking coffee too much
when I can drink it and then get sleepy.

1181
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,600
Yeah. That's where you know like you've
got to stop drinking coffee dude.

1182
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:05,510
You know if you drink it so much you can
drink it and all sudden you get sleepy

1183
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:09,920
or I don't know. It's probably not
good for your liver. Like going Ah,

1184
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:13,290
too much coffee or kidneys trying
to shut you down and go dude.

1185
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:17,490
They say a little bit of coffee is
not bad for you, but you can get the,

1186
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,890
the problem with like
Starbucks coffee is if,

1187
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:23,220
which is the best only hate
nonstop. I'm not, when I say,

1188
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,950
listen Bro, I'm a gold
card name. Okay man. No,

1189
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:30,330
there's a coffee bean thermos in
front of me, but that's not a,

1190
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:33,030
not because I'm disloyal
that product placement,

1191
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:38,160
but the problem is that Starbucks coffee
has a fuck load of caffeine in it. Wait,

1192
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,740
not enough.
That's why I drink it.

1193
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:46,660
My new thing is getting iced coffee
unsweetened with three shots and then ivy

1194
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:50,550
three, three, three, three man.

1195
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:53,610
But they say espresso is not
as much caffeine as coffee. No,

1196
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:57,390
but that's on top of a three cups of
coffee though. Yeah, that's three.

1197
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:02,610
Three cups of Espresso. One was
like 300 coffee, right? Yeah.

1198
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:07,770
A shot of espresso. I was like three
cups of coffee. No, no, no, no, no.

1199
01:12:07,771 --> 01:12:10,500
It's like a week, a cup of coffee,
like this, three week cups of coffee,

1200
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:15,210
but they're like, oh, I'm sorry. I thought
you were saying that each shot. Oh No,

1201
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:18,870
it's not quite a cup of coffee.
It's a shot is espresso.

1202
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:21,420
It's like slightly below
an average cup of coffee,

1203
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,980
but that's how they may call her. No, no.

1204
01:12:23,981 --> 01:12:27,540
It's fucking fascinating subject
because you can get, I mean, look,

1205
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:30,120
when you go and get a Venti,
you go and get a Venti Starbucks.

1206
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:32,310
You take somebody who has
never drink coffee before,

1207
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:34,980
someone who doesn't take any stimulants.
It doesn't do it,

1208
01:12:34,981 --> 01:12:36,200
and you just give them that venti.

1209
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:39,690
They might have to sit down
like they might be so jacked.
They might be like, wow,

1210
01:12:39,691 --> 01:12:42,450
my heartbeat speeding too fast.
But that's the pitch room coffee.

1211
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,840
Your hands can be shaken, but
meanwhile you get used to it. Yeah.

1212
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:49,740
You know you'd get drugged up. That's the
legal drug. What are you talking about?

1213
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:52,110
It is don't caffeine.
That's legal and it's the drug.

1214
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:57,100
How many coffees a day do you have,
Jason? I Dunno, like two 14 not.

1215
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,650
I know I'm real high tension.

1216
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:03,000
I don't allow myself more than one go
and tell him it's too is if I'm really

1217
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:04,380
busy work.
And that's what I mean.

1218
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:09,600
I'll go like in the morning and then
in the afternoon sometimes Bam height,

1219
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:12,660
I going to Starbucks. I would like
to see you on a muscle relaxer,

1220
01:13:12,661 --> 01:13:14,510
but you'd just be like, hello
guys, how are you doing today?

1221
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:17,730
Oh Shit would have no effect.
Shit broke.

1222
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:24,050
Yeah,
that's,

1223
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:29,120
you'd do they to add a juice me up with
a lot of that stuff to put me to sleep

1224
01:13:29,121 --> 01:13:32,630
though. Yeah. Yeah. When I got operated,

1225
01:13:32,631 --> 01:13:36,620
put a plate in my thumb and they're like,
all right,

1226
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:39,290
we're going to pump you full of stuff.
And he goes in there to, you know, put,

1227
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:43,490
put it in there and I'm like, role. I'd
feel like a giant rush over my whole body.

1228
01:13:43,491 --> 01:13:48,140

like, okay, just relax. I'm like,

1229
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:52,940
Nah. Ah Man, I'm high right now.

1230
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,670
You beat your best to be
operated on and this is the cut.

1231
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:01,500
Yeah. I like man, I'm high
right now. I was like that.
And the guy looks at me like,

1232
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:06,110
and I realized that the stuff is too weak
and I'm like, you can't knock me out.

1233
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:11,040
You can't have a guy. Like the
guy was laughing at it. I kinda,

1234
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:15,340
I remember as I'm all blurry like with
all the drugs like and I'm like man I

1235
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:19,000
look and I remember him like smirking
at me and then going back. Oh Man,

1236
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:21,100
I shouldn't talk shit to him like that.
Wow.

1237
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:26,130
Cause Cause I came out of it like
thinking I was in a fight like ah,

1238
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,490
like, like kicking out the nurses and
everything like that. And I was like Oh.

1239
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,460
And I was like, oh my bad.
Like I was like, oh sorry.

1240
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:38,470
Then I felt so sick cause he pumped me
so full of that stuff that like I can,

1241
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:40,420
I was like, man, what did I do?

1242
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:45,250
And it's a fucking nurse or
they do you know what they had?

1243
01:14:45,251 --> 01:14:48,250
They were gonna use to it. I'm used to
do like in them. Yeah. They were like,

1244
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:51,490
yeah cause they do like all like
extreme athlete. Crazy dudes. Yeah.

1245
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,530
And they're like, yeah, we've, we've,

1246
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:56,800
we've seen people like jump up out of
their seats and they were like, hey,

1247
01:14:56,801 --> 01:14:59,400
it was a fellow. And I was like, oh
I burst. Sorry. Like I was apologetic

1248
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:03,600
going out like that
operated on already.

1249
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:07,420
He's stitched up together.
Yeah. Weird. Very strange.

1250
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,930
How many operations have yet?
I don't know for,

1251
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,480
we've yet done so nice.

1252
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:17,770
Like cleaning out stuff and ACL
replacement and like putting out,

1253
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:22,510
putting up addie. Just one ACL replacement
in the gym. Yeah. Both of them.

1254
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,120
Both of them done. Yeah.
Like I had and I had uh,

1255
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:27,670
the middle of my knee cutout cause uh,

1256
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,300
cause like it was knowing that a lot
of me, it cut it out. What is it,

1257
01:15:31,301 --> 01:15:35,890
what do you mean in the middle of their
meniscus? It was sticking out. Oh.

1258
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:37,920
Oh, a bucket handle. Tam Bucket.

1259
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,850
Wow. You know, I left. Oh yeah.
We told him that shit up. Right.

1260
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:45,290
It would click stuck. They'll
get stuck. I'm like, Oh God.

1261
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,640
And I'm just like yanked that thing

1262
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:50,300
now. That shit is a ferocious pain
to the meniscus. Pain is tough.

1263
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:53,270
That's tough to feign. Yeah.
Very difficult to ignore.

1264
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:57,920
It's not something you just walk off.
No. And I'll get a bone piercing pain.

1265
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:03,410
We Niesr so fucking painful.
Did you know a couple of testicles added

1266
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:06,440
like 17 testicles?

1267
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:10,600
Brian?
Why you look in?

1268
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:15,000
He just checked your package to 17
testicles and taking might have a few more

1269
01:16:15,001 --> 01:16:18,750
than the other guys.
He's got extra balls.

1270
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:23,351
Yeah.

1271
01:16:23,351 --> 01:16:26,020
It's amazing that they can stitch you
up and put you back together again now

1272
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:28,930
though, isn't it fucking cool? Like how
many guys do you know that if I know,

1273
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,060
I know guys, Yvette
discs replaced, you know,

1274
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:36,090
artificial discs stuck in between
and had their disks fused. Yeah.

1275
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:39,800
Tito had that done. Who else have they
done? Nate Marquardt had no nightmare.

1276
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:43,240
Knee quarry had that done. A lot
of guys over. They're done. They,

1277
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:46,480
they blow up their discs and they get
their shit replaced and they can go right

1278
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:51,450
back and fight against fucking crazy.
That used to be a deal breaker. Like your,

1279
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:52,870
your discs were jacked,

1280
01:16:52,871 --> 01:16:55,960
like forget about competitive athletics
on the highest level, you know,

1281
01:16:55,961 --> 01:16:59,650
there's no way man. And if you're
used to be ACL got jack, like my,

1282
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:01,720
and you were done for everyone.

1283
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,900
Like I was like shocked that I
thought a field that like Nah,

1284
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:08,690
you just go and they, we put you back
together. I'm like, oh awesome. And it's,

1285
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,250
it's powerful than the original.

1286
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:14,570
My ACL, this man is stronger
than it was like, I was like,

1287
01:17:14,571 --> 01:17:18,680
what the hell did the workouts on whatever
and then it's like you use a cadaver.

1288
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:21,560
Yeah. Well you know they use an
achilles tendon. That's what they use.

1289
01:17:21,561 --> 01:17:25,160
It's a big fat fucking cable. It's
bigger than what's naturally in there.

1290
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:28,760
What's naturally in their
sucks. Wow. You're shooting
that. I have like illegal me.

1291
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,700
I got both. Both of mine are done. Yeah.

1292
01:17:30,701 --> 01:17:32,840
This one was done with a
Patella tendon graft out,

1293
01:17:32,841 --> 01:17:36,500
which kind of sucks where they did take
a chunk out of your bone in a strip of

1294
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:40,130
meat where you're tending is and it's
attached to your Shin and then they open

1295
01:17:40,131 --> 01:17:44,420
you up and then they screw it in place.
It takes a long ass time to heal from it.

1296
01:17:44,421 --> 01:17:45,080
It's much,

1297
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,890
much longer recuperation time cause he
got a hole in your Shin or a hole in your

1298
01:17:48,891 --> 01:17:51,520
knee cap and a hole in your sharing.
Like if they'd cut it out and I saw your,

1299
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:55,790
your tendon's been all fucked up. So
it's, it's a way more invasive thing.

1300
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:57,890
This one I had done,
it was a,

1301
01:17:57,891 --> 01:18:01,640
they did a cadaver than my right one and
there's just like two little tiny holes

1302
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:04,910
and they stitched him up and that's it.
It was all fixed. I mean, it's crazy.

1303
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:08,510
They just get in there and screw this
new joint in place. They used to be,

1304
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:12,110
if you lived, you know, a thousand years
ago, man, you are a cripple. You know,

1305
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:12,980
you were fucked.

1306
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,430
You were that guy that would fall down
if the wind blew [inaudible] black

1307
01:18:16,431 --> 01:18:18,860
president. We have, we're
in the future right now.

1308
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:24,590
It's just think it's so cool that they
get patched you up and put you back

1309
01:18:24,591 --> 01:18:28,760
together again, you know? Yeah. We live
in the future. I don't have a jet pack,

1310
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,160
but whatever.
Have you ever had your elbows done?

1311
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:34,910
Shoulders is supposed to be
the worst. No. Terry shoulders.

1312
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:37,490
That's supposed to be out of the
biggest pain in the ass to recoup. Yeah.

1313
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,730
Dancing with the devil.
That's what I do every day.

1314
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:45,580
And do you ever think that like, man,
like I'm, I'm, I'm fucking staking my,

1315
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:47,990
my living on my physical flesh.

1316
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:53,620
Dancing is fun. Here's the
funnest thing for you, right? I,

1317
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:57,500
I can't, I can't help it. It's so fun.
And I like doing crazy stuff all the time.

1318
01:18:57,550 --> 01:19:00,560
Do you think you're going to have a long
career to get to Redo this for a long

1319
01:19:00,561 --> 01:19:05,240
time? Yeah. I think I could do
it. I'd do it for a long time,

1320
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:09,380
but you know, that's my job.
You know, I, I feel good.

1321
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:13,010
He definitely better now than you've ever
been before. And what are you, 29 now?

1322
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:15,860
Yeah, it. Oh yeah, change it up.

1323
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:19,010
You bout to hit 29 about
eight 30 30 got damn.

1324
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:22,700
That's like when you're an adult dude and
no. So I've been feeling it. I'm like,

1325
01:19:22,701 --> 01:19:25,280
I feel kind of happy about it. Like
I'm like, I'm going to be an adult.

1326
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:29,870
We gotta get you over in the UFC, man.
All the strike force nonsense. If this,

1327
01:19:29,871 --> 01:19:33,650
if this Nick Diaz thing doesn't work,
man, I hope that you have, see picture up.

1328
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:36,710
I'm gonna have to go get
Joe Silva massage somewhere.

1329
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:42,290
Maybe you have to get them a fucking
gift certificate for somewhere cool.

1330
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,740
Some wonderful restaurant and
have a nice meal. I take her nuts.

1331
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:50,170

what are we doing with the Strikeforce
nonsense, you know, mayhem. Miller.

but I trained with them too in a
thought of me like 19 like man,

crashed through the cage. Wow.

1341
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:30,960
There's video of it somewhere where a
man, I was so young, man. I was like,

1342

little, he's a little older than me.

1344
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,910
When you watch this fight with Anderson
Silva, Anderson Silva pound for pound,

1345
01:20:41,911 --> 01:20:46,050
best fighter in the world, you know, UFC
long running middle weight champion. What,

1346

what did you think when you saw that
fight? The Chelsea on the fight?

1347
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:50,610
Were you thinking, I
mean, you know, you're,

1348
01:20:50,611 --> 01:20:54,450
you're a guy competing for the Strikeforce
title at one 85 you see Anderson,

1349
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:58,790

like of course my weight,
I'm done.

1352
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:09,920
That was the most intense I've ever
watched the fight. Really like yeah,

1353
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:12,270
that's what I was thinking. It
must be, right? Yeah, of course.

1354
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:15,540
Cause I'm like in the little
soap opera, I kinda, you know,

1355
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:19,410
watching this like the,
we're all, you know,

1356

the same way you can be fighting that
guy either soon. Yeah. Easy. Yeah.

1357
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:27,840
Both guys. Really. Exactly. So
anything can happen. Of course.

1358
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:32,260
How long is your contract at Strikeforce?
I believe I don't have a fight left.

1359
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,610
One fight left? Yeah, I think
so. And I'm so that if you, uh,

1360
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:40,560
if you beat Nick Diaz then do
you get to fight for the title?

1361
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:45,180
I have, yeah. I a couple of
bites of things and I have um,

1362
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:49,440
two fights. Yeah, I think
so. Yeah. So what are they
talking about now? If is nick,

1363
01:21:49,441 --> 01:21:52,020
if Nicnas doesn't want to fight,
do you get to fight Jack Ryan?

1364
01:21:52,021 --> 01:21:56,400
Do you have to fight Tim Kennedy?
Like what do you do? What's next? Uh,

1365
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:58,830
I don't know. They don't know, they're
just trying to get the Nick Diaz fight.

1366
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:01,770
Well, I mean that's the fight
that everyone wants to see
him. That's cool. And I,

1367
01:22:01,771 --> 01:22:04,650
you know, I'm down, you know,
it's like, that's my job.

1368
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:07,620
I'm down to do whatever it does it
get in the way. When you're filming,

1369
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:10,680
bully beat down, you know, does
it get any way with your training?

1370
01:22:10,681 --> 01:22:14,130
Like do you have to like train, um, like
when you, when you were filming that show,

1371
01:22:14,131 --> 01:22:16,350
do you have to like make sure that you
don't have any fight scheduled for a

1372
01:22:16,351 --> 01:22:18,030
while? It's going down. Yeah, of course.

1373
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,510
I didn't want to run it concurrent
with the right training camp.

1374
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:25,640
It would fuck it up hard.
Right? Yeah. What kind of
hours? I took fight, I took, uh,

1375
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:32,130
uh, you know, for, for training that
bullied be now only takes two weeks.

1376
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:36,720
So what does that monkey on?
What'd you do? Right. Oh Wow.

1377
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:41,530
Did you just cut and paste that but a
pretty cool, yeah, it is pretty cool. Um,

1378
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,830
I dunno, you know, I only takes
two weeks to do the bully be down.

1379
01:22:44,831 --> 01:22:46,850
So for the whole season.
Whoa.

1380
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:51,690
That's like more than two weeks cause
I have to go to do voiceover or do you

1381
01:22:51,691 --> 01:22:55,650
guys do 10 at a time?
Usually. Wow. So it's,

1382
01:22:55,660 --> 01:23:00,300
it's a fun like a, it's like a
fun little summer camp. Like Yay,

1383
01:23:00,301 --> 01:23:02,070
let's go fill, bully be down.
It's going to be hilarious.

1384
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:05,350
Well it must have been way more fun coming
into this season now that it's a big

1385
01:23:05,351 --> 01:23:06,420
success.
Yeah.

1386
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:11,080
Like now everything like everybody like
wants you there and happy to see a and

1387
01:23:11,081 --> 01:23:14,530
all excited and so pumped up.
What do you mean people that network?

1388
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:18,010
People in the studio like you're on a
successful show. That's when it starts.

1389
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:22,540
That's what it's fucking bad ass, right
when it's successful. Exactly. Yeah.

1390
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:27,790
You know things are rolling when things
are that third season of it. You know,

1391
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:31,930
I never seen an audience
so pumped up fans.

1392
01:23:31,931 --> 01:23:36,130
They're fans or fans first they was
like just people who were like, what?

1393
01:23:36,131 --> 01:23:38,860
What is this?
When we used to film news radio,

1394
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:42,040
there's a big difference between
the first season and news radio,

1395
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:44,890
like the audience and the
third season when it gets,

1396
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,920
when it gets into where the
fans come to watch the show,

1397
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,220
that's when it becomes fun. Yeah, it's,

1398
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:56,140
it is crazy experience filming shows is
so hard in the beginning because no one

1399
01:23:56,141 --> 01:23:57,340
knows what the fuck is going on.

1400
01:23:57,341 --> 01:23:59,980
You're trying to establish a rhythm and
it's like, you know, you're awesome,

1401
01:23:59,981 --> 01:24:03,880
but nobody else,
I wasn't gonna say that.

1402
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,980
What I was saying is it
just takes a long time.

1403
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,500
Everybody who works on that show
was like awesome people and,

1404
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:13,600
and you know what I mean?
It's like they're all Colby.

1405
01:24:13,601 --> 01:24:18,160
I got more into doing the bully beatdown
job by the fact that the people who

1406
01:24:18,161 --> 01:24:22,750
work on it are just so awesome people.
You're just such awesome, awesome people.

1407
01:24:22,751 --> 01:24:23,620
So I'm like,
oh,

1408
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:27,670
like I really want to do a good job
because these people right here are cool.

1409
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:31,780
So let me try to do a really good job
because you don't see that working,

1410
01:24:31,781 --> 01:24:33,460
but they're working really hard now.

1411
01:24:33,461 --> 01:24:37,090
Did when all the shit went down with the
CBS thing where you got in trouble and

1412
01:24:37,091 --> 01:24:39,340
the,
the big fight and the brawl on television,

1413
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,800
did they give you a hard time over that?
What do you mean?

1414
01:24:41,801 --> 01:24:43,570
What are they going to give me
a hard time about it for him?

1415
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:47,550
Nobody gives you a hard time bully beat
down people. No one says like, you know,

1416
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:51,070
hey, you know, we can't get involved and
I don't even think they were worried.

1417
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:54,670
What do you mean they weren't,
you know, you know what I'm
saying? Like, no, no, no,

1418
01:24:54,671 --> 01:24:57,700
no. What I'm saying is like when, when
when a controversy happens like this,

1419
01:24:57,910 --> 01:25:01,450
like they don't want you
involved in anything that's
negative or anything that's

1420
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:04,480
like, you know, like they don't have,
they don't sit down with you and say, hey,

1421
01:25:04,481 --> 01:25:09,080
you can't be getting into brawls cause you
know, you, you represented the show. No,

1422
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:14,510
no. I think that they, I think
they understood my thigh. Like,

1423
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:15,101
you know what I mean?

1424
01:25:15,101 --> 01:25:17,590
Like they understood the whole
how the whole thing went down.

1425
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,040
But I mean in the news it wasn't, it
wasn't pretty, it wasn't clear cut.

1426
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:25,240
There's a lot of people that are blaming
you. Yeah, well they're just jerks.

1427
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:28,890
They didn't get that mad about it,
about it. That bully beat downs.

1428
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,850
That's like my fighting career. They don't
worry about my fighting career. I have,

1429
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:36,520
I don't feel like they the what do you
think that MTV is going to Spank me for

1430
01:25:36,521 --> 01:25:37,870
that? No, no, no, no, no ma'am.

1431
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:41,590
I was wondering whether or
not anyone was concerned.

1432
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:45,790
Was there anyone said anything to,
you know what? Nobody talks to me.

1433
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:50,350
I'm just ma'am.
So funny you say it like,

1434
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:52,750
like it's ridiculous to ask.

1435
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:57,790
Got You got an a bench clearing
brawl on national television.

1436
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:02,570
But he's a fighter though. I know that
shit happens. That's, it happened again.

1437
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:05,470
But [inaudible]

1438
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:13,090
I know they have the Jersey shore on.
I know they don't fuck around now.

1439
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:16,510
People are just roofie
bad, you know? I mean,

1440
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,530
when I saw that girl get punched in the
face, did you see that online? Oh yeah.

1441
01:26:19,531 --> 01:26:21,890
I thought like, I don't think they showed
it on the show. They blacked it out.

1442
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:25,460
Yeah, I think they, yeah, they, they
blurted are similar. They blur it.

1443
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,220
They didn't want people to see it grow.
Get punched in the face and then say,

1444
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:32,140
because they could show, look, we
have a giant reading spike. Right?

1445
01:26:32,141 --> 01:26:34,280
Does this girl gets punched in the face?
This is what we need.

1446
01:26:34,281 --> 01:26:35,690
We need more girls getting
punched in the face.

1447
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:41,360
Did you see the girl that's on dancing
with the stars that Sarah Palin's

1448
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:45,320
daughter, whatever Esther Perel
is talking to the situation. Yeah.

1449
01:26:45,321 --> 01:26:47,450
It was pretty fun.
That was the most,

1450
01:26:47,451 --> 01:26:51,710
one of the most ridiculous on dancing
with show because I get the fee,

1451
01:26:51,711 --> 01:26:54,740
the normal like everyday funny
stuff and I would never see,

1452
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:57,130
I never watched a show like that man.

1453
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:01,460
The soup had it on there and it was
man, bring it up. Just bring it up.

1454
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,160
How strong,

1455
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:09,760
how strange is it that dancing with
the star has potential campaign vice

1456
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:16,060
presidential camp campaigners
daughter who's like seven wishy,

1457
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:18,980
like 18 or something like you know,
something like that now 19 now.

1458
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,530
Something really young.
Like, how has that,

1459
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:24,810
how she's a celebrity and she's talking
because she was pregnant cause he was,

1460
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,130
cause it was a story that she was in
the news. I mean that's ridiculous.

1461
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:30,710
Like how is that a celebrity?
That's so weird.

1462
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:34,560
You know that that like
debts dancing with the stars.

1463
01:27:34,561 --> 01:27:35,900
Like that's what they're calling a star.

1464
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:39,140
They're calling this young girl whose
mom was running for vice president,

1465
01:27:39,141 --> 01:27:41,780
which is happening at pregnant. Everybody
knew about it. They're calling our star.

1466
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,810
But that's so odd. You'd
have that a dancing with the
stars. You know, here's high.

1467
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,050
She's a star and it's situation.
Check this out very.

1468
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:53,000
You look at me like he was some Zen Koan.

1469
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,340
Like what is the sound of
one hand clapping? Exactly.

1470
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:00,950
No she is, but it's like the
line is getting blurry now.

1471
01:28:00,951 --> 01:28:03,410
It's like anybody who is in the news,
it's not,

1472
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:07,040
you know when you dancing with the
stars is no longer entertainers.

1473
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,420
It's no longer,
yeah,

1474
01:28:08,421 --> 01:28:12,710
that's anybody that anything happened
to where they got famous there stars.

1475
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:17,210
It's like idols in Japan. They already
have that and then you become like a show.

1476
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,290
They'll check in on,

1477
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:20,660
they'll check in on you to see
what the fuck's going on with you.

1478
01:28:20,661 --> 01:28:25,250
And what are you doing today? Crazy.
Like the Carrie Prejean chick.

1479
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,610
Remember the chicken ran for a,

1480
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:31,610
was it Miss USA that a gay people?
She's always get something,

1481
01:28:31,611 --> 01:28:34,370
man. It's always something
in the mix where you're
talking about the girl want to

1482
01:28:34,371 --> 01:28:37,550
check up on her. The uh, Miss
South Carolina pageant, right?

1483
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:42,020
The such as like, uh, no, no,
not, that girl was hilarious,

1484
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,780
but that was just a brain fart.
That poor chick,

1485
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:48,350
she just got caught in the headlights.
Whatever was adorable. It was adorable.

1486
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,850
Yeah. You liked it. I liked my
girls to be all scatterbrains

1487
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:56,930
girls like gingerly,
like Bambi, like that.

1488
01:28:57,250 --> 01:29:00,800
Does that get you excited to like look
at this girl just dragged her into the

1489
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:02,410
mayhem void?
No Man.

1490
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:05,790
Where you think I clubbed chicks over the
head and drag on your personality, Bro.

1491
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:09,610
Just with your personality. You could
just overtake them, do you think so? Hey,

1492
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:13,100
let's run over here and I'm just, see
a girl was saying like as, and um,

1493
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:16,590
you could just dominate your mind.

1494
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:20,190
She's not retarded.
She's just easily led.

1495
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:25,710
So mentally handicapped.
Maude supermodels is what I'm looking for.

1496
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:30,370
Maybe sometimes it's not the worst thing.
That's all I'm saying. Totally mentally.

1497
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:34,980
Like cap it, like really happy
just hanging out with their dog.

1498
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:35,933
Think about it that way.

1499
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:39,420
There's a lot of people that are super
smart and super healthy and they're just

1500
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:41,010
hanging out with her dog and
there's nothing wrong with that.

1501
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:44,490
But a lot of people get plenty of
companionship just from their dog.

1502
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:47,130
So if that's the case and they're
super happy for the rest of the life,

1503
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:50,940
you could date someone who's really dumb.
She's really allows, are nice to you.

1504
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:53,580
Who Cares? It cute. Somebody
just like having a dog.

1505
01:29:53,650 --> 01:29:54,580
Somebody like this.

1506
01:29:58,510 --> 01:30:01,360
What are you doing, Brian? That's a video
that we were talking about. Excuse me.

1507
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:05,650
Have you ever had a situation
with the, uh, official situation,

1508
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:09,310
excuse me. Oh, snap. Be Pailin.

1509
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:12,340
You mean to tell me that girls actually
fall for that line? Come on. I mean,

1510
01:30:12,341 --> 01:30:13,660
if those words don't work,

1511
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:17,380
I got the situation right there.

1512
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:20,650
I hope you're as committed to
same sex as you are those abs.

1513
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:24,700
I know you're all about that abstinence
thing, you know, but come on,

1514
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:26,470
be Pailin.
Are you serious?

1515
01:30:26,471 --> 01:30:30,430
Like you're not going to hook up with
like before you mag for real. For Real.

1516
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:33,880
For Real. For Real. For Real.
For Real, for real. All right.

1517
01:30:33,881 --> 01:30:36,400
Well you know what I mean?
Just in case you do get into a situation,

1518
01:30:36,401 --> 01:30:39,520
I want to make sure that you are situated
because if you do get into a situation

1519
01:30:39,521 --> 01:30:40,450
with your situation,

1520
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,260
you may end up with a situation and
you may not like that situation.

1521
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:47,080
Trust me though, I'm not getting
myself into another situation.

1522
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:49,630
I know how hard it is to be a teen parent.
You know what?

1523
01:30:49,631 --> 01:30:52,930
I totally respect that and I
totally respect abstinence.

1524
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:56,710
I mean it actually has the word
[inaudible] on the situation. I love that.

1525
01:30:56,711 --> 01:31:00,190
Very funny. But I'm worried about
you and you practicing safe sex.

1526
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:04,570
I actually practice a whole lot. I mean
a whole lot about the safe part of that.

1527
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:08,560
Ah, the safe part. We got the
safe part down pat. What pile?

1528
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:14,890
Magnums? You know what, I might
be able to spare one. I mean,

1529
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:19,600
you know, I'll give you one. It's fine. I
avoid situations. All right, good. Good.

1530
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:23,860
If you're good in voiding situations
and you're situated and I'm situated,

1531
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:27,970
situation's under control. Well,
I'm glad that we agree on one thing.

1532
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,530
Pause before you play.
Pause before you play it right

1533
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:33,620
by them. You know what? This, what
is it? So fucking high school video.

1534
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:37,430
Who made this? What was this
on? Hold on. What was this on

1535
01:31:37,570 --> 01:31:40,830
the, uh, the candies foundation. Huh?

1536
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:43,230
What was it on? Television
was a commercial bill. Was it?

1537
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:47,220
I Dunno. Was a PSA bro from, yeah.

1538
01:31:47,221 --> 01:31:49,290
It's a PSA of some sort.
Dude.

1539
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:54,560
That shit was designed by the terrorists
that's designed to lower our standards

1540
01:31:55,111 --> 01:31:58,230
and weaken our wills and they're going
gonna fucking cross our borders and just

1541
01:31:58,231 --> 01:32:00,190
start raping and I totally

1542
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:05,010
mother fucker. That was dumb. Yeah.
Holy Shit. That was scary. Dumb.

1543
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:09,700
It was the situation.
Need situation, situation,

1544
01:32:09,701 --> 01:32:12,730
situation. Whoa. Whoever wrote that.

1545
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:16,180
But let's try not to get your tie
a bicycle chain around your neck.

1546
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:17,920
They're trying to get up in the ocean.

1547
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:21,760
You're trying to give the kids a bicycle
chain so that means they could like

1548
01:32:21,761 --> 01:32:24,340
pedal out of it baby slowly drown.
What?

1549
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:28,140
I want him to slowly drop just farm.

1550
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,960
So I'm dropping in the middle of
the ocean. I just want, you know,

1551
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,820
you got to get that chain off for.
Yeah.

1552
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:39,130
What I'm saying is fuck you bitch.
Goddammit.

1553
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,090
Jesus stopped knocking the microphone,
man. He's sort of a bitch. Fuck,

1554
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:47,050
aren't you hearing that? No, I don't even
hear it. Does it hurt your ears? Yeah,

1555
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:51,940
dude, it hurts everybody who's listening
to that shit allowed us far. Okay.

1556
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,970
Here's the situation.
The situation,

1557
01:32:53,971 --> 01:32:58,180
his parents out towns don't want people
to like, you know, Bang each other.

1558
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:01,870
But what is that about? She's pretending
she doesn't take Dick Anymore.

1559
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:06,220
How dare you? How dare you?
You know he's taking my keys.

1560
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:10,120
Doesn't have like sex without a condom.
Yeah,

1561
01:33:10,121 --> 01:33:12,970
he's pulling out condoms.
It's had sex in a tanning bed.

1562
01:33:12,971 --> 01:33:15,880
He's probably not wearing a
condom. You don't think so? No.

1563
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:19,270
Did you have sex on a tanning bed
on the show? We probably. Well,

1564
01:33:19,271 --> 01:33:24,090
that's gotta be bad for your eyes.
Have you ever masturbated tanning bed?

1565
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:27,640
I sometimes masturbate about the chick
that checks me in at the tanning bed

1566
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:31,270
because she's so fucking hot and she has
huge tits and she's, Oh wait, nevermind.

1567
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:36,040
Problem. They have a problem with
women doing that and tanning beds.

1568
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:38,430
I've heard that the women liked
to masturbate. Tanning beds.

1569
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:43,070
One of masturbate in a
hot room, right? Well

1570
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:47,080
maybe an Eskimo.

1571
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:50,620
They're worse as if you spray though and
then it's like early on in the tanning

1572
01:33:50,621 --> 01:33:54,580
it starts to like sizzle.
Curse your cooking. Geez,

1573
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:55,650
off what's on your stomach?

1574
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:59,910
It sounds like it's a little
seven up kiss by your ear.

1575
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:04,270
Low point of this
podcast. TJ's all. What's

1576
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:09,240
omelets get your toaster.
I go too far.

1577
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:14,470
Your how many times do you walked out
of the House with dry loads on your

1578
01:34:14,471 --> 01:34:19,360
stomach? Man, never. Never.
Whatever's throwing a shirt.
Balance at fucking affairs.

1579
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:21,490
My belly, like I missed the
spot or something like that.

1580
01:34:21,491 --> 01:34:22,930
It does feel a little crunchiness.

1581
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:26,980
Jim Norton had a load in his belly button
from the night before and we were on

1582
01:34:26,981 --> 01:34:31,180
Opie and Anthony and he was telling
everybody, he's like, oh, I'm smelling it.

1583
01:34:31,181 --> 01:34:34,160
Hold on a second. And he dips his
finger in it and he gave it to, uh,

1584
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:35,710
one of the interns.
I forget who it was,

1585
01:34:35,711 --> 01:34:39,460
and he made smell it and he almost threw
up. And then he goes, you want to try it?

1586
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:43,480
I go, all right. What? So he
sticks. He sticks the smell. I mean,

1587
01:34:43,481 --> 01:34:48,070
basically I smelled it so that,
that dead. Why would horrible smell?

1588
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:51,580
Because I was there. It was on
the radio. Fucking I'll smell it.

1589
01:34:52,170 --> 01:34:53,880
I smell some of the load.

1590
01:34:53,881 --> 01:34:57,560
Some of his belly load came into
my nose and the form of fumes,

1591
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:03,140
basically. I would say no
to that, wouldn't you say?
Yeah. I should've said no.

1592
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,670
Wow. Other radio. I'm just trying
to think of Joe. Sure, I'll do it.

1593
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:09,790
But it's the listening to the
radio when you're on the radio,

1594
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:12,860
just like on this podcast. Everybody's at
Penn. You just trying to have fun, right?

1595
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:14,270
Try to do,
what's the funniest thing?

1596
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:16,910
The funniest thing is that guy says you
want to smell my stinky low? Do you go,

1597
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:21,290
okay, fuck it. Come on. We're on the
radio. You know, awesome. All your load.

1598
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,660
If you really want me to get the hell.

1599
01:35:23,661 --> 01:35:25,790
And he was kind of shocked as
I was that I was smelling it.

1600
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:27,530
Can I go to the bathroom?
Yeah, go ahead man.

1601
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:30,770
That's right on a jerk offs and put one
load in my belly button. Don't do it.

1602
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,233
Don't do it.

1603
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:35,480
There's something about the shape of the
belly button that makes the loads from

1604
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:39,710
Matt and fester and again,
are you really moving?

1605
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:41,110
Know he doesn't really
have to go to the bathroom.

1606
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:43,820
You don't have to go to the bathroom.
Thanks dude. Brian didn't see it.

1607
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:46,820
He didn't see them.
The joke man. Good job.

1608
01:35:46,821 --> 01:35:49,140
You didn't even get my jokes
was an awesome job Brian,

1609
01:35:49,141 --> 01:35:51,300
and you just totally messed. I was
doing something. I can remember what

1610
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:55,550
we've got it down to a science,

1611
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,410
how much pot you should smoke
before one of these things.

1612
01:35:57,890 --> 01:36:01,370
But sometimes I was finding another video
for you and when you guys were talking,

1613
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:04,340
the stars don't align. Align.
What was another video?

1614
01:36:04,341 --> 01:36:07,460
Another PSA with a situation next.
I don't know if I can fucking take it.

1615
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,850
I felt like you wasted moments in my life.
At the same time.

1616
01:36:10,851 --> 01:36:14,120
I think it's a step in the right direction
that abstinence people have gone.

1617
01:36:14,121 --> 01:36:18,950
Well people aren't gonna stop
fucking so try to wear a condom out.

1618
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,090
What they're doing. Yeah, because
before people would like to,

1619
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:25,000
abstinence people are over religious.
It's all religious people. No one of us.

1620
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:29,300
My brain. It's talking about abstinence.
That's just against human nature.

1621
01:36:29,301 --> 01:36:31,310
You can't stop.
If that's true.

1622
01:36:31,311 --> 01:36:33,860
Why would they even think for
a second to this situation?

1623
01:36:33,861 --> 01:36:37,520
Would rep best represent that place?
I think because they think of him.

1624
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:41,780
He's the guy who bangs a lot, you know?
I mean whatever they're trying to paint.

1625
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:44,780
I think they just think he's famous.
I think it's that simple.

1626
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:49,310
I think it's as simple as he's famous.
He's in the news.

1627
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:52,040
They can get him to do it. People
pay attention. Yeah, that's true.

1628
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:55,970
But that shit is so bad. That
whole, the situation, you know,

1629
01:36:55,971 --> 01:37:00,100
if you get in this situation and
her talking to me was so dumb Joey.

1630
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:08,083
Okay.

1631
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:09,270
This Joey Diaz.

1632
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:10,540
Okay.

1633
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:13,750
How dare he,
I'm not answering shit.

1634
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:17,410
So joy anyway,
it's just picking up the phone bro.

1635
01:37:17,650 --> 01:37:19,530
I need to remember to unplug this phone.

1636
01:37:19,570 --> 01:37:21,640
Most people don't call me
when we're doing a podcast,

1637
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:27,010
but occasionally someone gets confused.
Robot, I know anyone of those, right?

1638
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:30,730
Yes. Just need to unplug it. Problem
is the base is not in this room.

1639
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:35,260
I'm a disorganized motherfucker.
Brian, I wish I had an e walk. I've um,

1640
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:38,080
I've made great strides
though and creating this room.

1641
01:37:38,410 --> 01:37:41,100
We actually have like a place
where we do the podcast every week.

1642
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:43,930
It feels like this is where it all
comes from. It feels like it's right.

1643
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:46,180
It's a desk.
It's like we got a soundboard.

1644
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:48,640
It's all professional equipment and shit.
You know,

1645
01:37:48,641 --> 01:37:51,520
a friend of mine just started watching
the podcast and he started with episode

1646
01:37:51,521 --> 01:37:54,820
one and he's like, Holy Shit Dude.
Like this is the craziest thing ever.

1647
01:37:54,821 --> 01:37:58,630
Like you guys are just sitting in front
of a laptop and yet snowflakes coming.

1648
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:03,170
They did all kinds of stupid, it's like
Christmas Eve or something like that.

1649
01:38:03,171 --> 01:38:07,500
Or was it something like
that? Yeah, the snowflakes.

1650
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:10,790
We don't even, we lost that
technology. It's hard enough to keep

1651
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:14,320
the image on the air, you
know, with um, these, uh,

1652
01:38:14,321 --> 01:38:18,730
these Ustream feeds like a lot of times
it cuts out and a lot of times, you know,

1653
01:38:18,731 --> 01:38:22,420
our, our Internet will shut off and it
cuts out. It's a pain in the ass man.

1654
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:23,260
You know,

1655
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:26,380
you just want to make sure that you're
just like most important thing is the

1656
01:38:26,381 --> 01:38:27,214
audio.

1657
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:29,770
Where do you get a tube that
goes right to the Internet?

1658
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:33,840
I'm not even sure what the Internet
is neither. Do you know what it is?

1659
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:37,840
Like if someone said, hey, you got to
go fix the Internet is broke. I know.

1660
01:38:37,841 --> 01:38:39,850
Like where would you walk
to with your tool belt?

1661
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:43,600
Like you're like the end of this hallway.
I mean,

1662
01:38:43,601 --> 01:38:48,520
it would be broke forever if it
was just left. Yeah, we're stupid.

1663
01:38:48,970 --> 01:38:53,600
No, you'd be like, where the fuck
is it? And how do you fix it?

1664
01:38:53,601 --> 01:38:58,330
You would have to relearn the whole
thing. I figured, Ooh, what's that?

1665
01:38:58,370 --> 01:39:01,490
What about your on what's going to be
very strange when everything's wireless

1666
01:39:01,491 --> 01:39:06,010
switches and then it's going to be
inevitable, but it's not as, you know,

1667
01:39:06,050 --> 01:39:10,040
not when there's no difference between
being plugged in and not being plugged in,

1668
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:13,400
which is probably inevitable. What are you
talking about? It's like that now. Yeah,

1669
01:39:13,401 --> 01:39:16,400
but it's not totally like
that now. There's a lot of
places that don't have wifi.

1670
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,640
There's a lot of people that have
their computers, computers plugged in,

1671
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:22,460
but there'd be eventually with, that's
not even an option. Like you don't even,

1672
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:26,240
why would you get a plug? But he's stupid.
You just turn it on, its picks it up.

1673
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:28,790
It's everywhere, you know?
That's, that's the next step.

1674
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:35,330
So it's fucking fascinating shit now
fascinating shit where all these computers

1675
01:39:35,331 --> 01:39:35,540
and

1676
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:37,490
it sucks when Shit starts
going wrong though.

1677
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,120
Like my shit's just all together going
wrong at the same time and I feel like

1678
01:39:41,121 --> 01:39:45,500
I'm just in a disaster right now.
My technology,

1679
01:39:45,501 --> 01:39:47,600
my computer,
you've got to everything a bunch of,

1680
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:51,290
and one of them that you shouldn't talk
about too much because of the nature of

1681
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:55,040
the problem. Oh you know that
one with the software issue?

1682
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:59,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no.
Like, you know what I'm saying? Right.

1683
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:04,210
You need a flashlight. Not like
all my, I thought wait, whoa.

1684
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:06,180
Re talking about an eyeball,

1685
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:10,270
but I'll know all my shit's like breaking
at the same time. Like all my, like my,

1686
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:14,670
my dog decided to eat my laptop cable
and my battery decided to dye my hard

1687
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:19,440
drives dying. And then I'm like my
TV, my uh, htmi cable shorted out my,

1688
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:21,490
my washing machine broke the other day.

1689
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:24,400
It's like everything is
Bracey became the apocalypse

1690
01:40:26,530 --> 01:40:31,530
technology 2012 I just thought you have
like super powers or something and like

1691
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:36,700
to magnetize the broken cables.
I thought, what are you doing?

1692
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:40,160
I'm putting it inside out. That
looks fucking discussed. Your,

1693
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:45,190
this is the flashlight that our guests
have to touch using it. And man,

1694
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:48,770
it's really dirty when you
take it out clean to clean.

1695
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:52,890
Like it looks really discussed.
Those at the butthole ones. Oh,

1696
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:57,460
this is I the one that you actually used,
remember? Yeah. Oh No, it's not man.

1697
01:40:57,461 --> 01:41:00,140
That looks like a real life
butthole. I have to say, man,

1698
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:03,950
the mount hole or two or three times a
week and actual mold. That's a real life.

1699
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:08,810
Someone says, well, you know,

1700
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:10,570
if you weren't in to doing gay porn,

1701
01:41:10,571 --> 01:41:14,910
but they offered you 1 million bucks
for a foam mold of your butthole.

1702
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:19,180
They said, listen, we're going to give
you a stone cold, solid $1 million.

1703
01:41:19,181 --> 01:41:20,014
All we need,

1704
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,780
we're just going to throw some plaster
of Paris over your Bot hold and make a

1705
01:41:22,781 --> 01:41:25,840
little impression of me. Yeah, and
sell something rough about hall.

1706
01:41:26,050 --> 01:41:27,430
Would you do it?
I'll do it for like

1707
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:28,570
$16

1708
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:36,730
$18 that's random,

1709
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,640
Brian,
for publicly for a mold of your bottle.

1710
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:42,780
This would be like an argument that
I'd have to have with my, yeah.

1711
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:45,570
Oh, you mean like don't do it.
I don't think you should do.

1712
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:50,800
It's $1 million. You wouldn't do it.
Yeah. Yeah. You gotta sell your butthole.

1713
01:41:51,210 --> 01:41:54,250
Are you going to do it while I'm
putting it out there? Right now,

1714
01:41:54,251 --> 01:41:59,020
I'm putting it out there to
all the would be for by, no,

1715
01:41:59,150 --> 01:42:03,550
I don't think your athlete over Brian.
I think you're right,

1716
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:08,140
but that's my price. 1 million.
I won't do the training.

1717
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:09,850
You're pricing yourself out.

1718
01:42:11,610 --> 01:42:16,490
If some crazy old gay freak with a
lot of cats steps up, talk you down.

1719
01:42:16,570 --> 01:42:20,260
Let's talk. You know what do you mean
mass produced? How much for mass produce?

1720
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:23,110
It has to be $1 million. It's
okay. It's very simple. You can't,

1721
01:42:23,111 --> 01:42:27,940
you wouldn't go to get a rubber mold
of my butt hole and it will cost you $1

1722
01:42:27,940 --> 01:42:31,810
million. I think I'm quite clear. I would
do it for 10,000 Chris to negotiate.

1723
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:36,370
Either way, I'm happy. I'm happy.
If it's yes, I'm happy if it's no,

1724
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:41,180
I don't care if you have
your price and Joe Rogan. No,

1725
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:45,760
I keep some self esteem points. I feel
good about myself. If it's yes, holy shit.

1726
01:42:45,761 --> 01:42:49,240
I just made 1 million bucks to lie down
with some plaster Paris over my butthole.

1727
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:52,090
All right, let's take it the other way.
Then, okay, let's do this. All right.

1728
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:57,520
At what point do you throw yourself
so bad? You know what I mean?

1729
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:58,990
That you can't recover.
All right.

1730
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:01,990
How much money would it take
you to like suck a horse?

1731
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:05,260
You know you could go back.
Yeah, you can go too far.

1732
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:10,690
You could certainly go too far, but
could you? Okay. How long has it taken?

1733
01:43:10,691 --> 01:43:13,330
A second source is Dick. What if you
only had a struggle? Horses, Dick,

1734
01:43:13,331 --> 01:43:14,164
until he came.

1735
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:18,700
What if? What if horses come really
quick? You know? I don't know,

1736
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:22,710
but they're super sensitive when you're
talking to, I'm taking a full load.

1737
01:43:22,711 --> 01:43:26,060
A load of the yard swallow
it because you can't. Okay.

1738
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:31,240
Pre comes probably at 12 gallon. Someone
might be able to get fucked by a horse,

1739
01:43:31,241 --> 01:43:34,130
but I don't see anybody swollen.
A horse lover. All right.

1740
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:36,550
You will fucking drown and that's not,

1741
01:43:36,551 --> 01:43:39,940
that's the worst way to call
the paramedics when you're
drowning by horse load

1742
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:41,560
and that shit would happen,
man.

1743
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:44,130
Maybe that old man show guy that
would chug the beers. Magic.

1744
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:48,040
I'm just trying to keep, keep up with
those says, well it's like, oh, of course.

1745
01:43:48,041 --> 01:43:49,330
Of course you wouldn't want to do that.

1746
01:43:49,331 --> 01:43:52,220
Of course there'll be a terrible
thing to do. But what if it was,

1747
01:43:52,221 --> 01:43:53,630
and this is the ultimate hack premise,

1748
01:43:53,631 --> 01:43:58,010
but what if it was for $100 million or
something crazy like that? Or a billion.

1749
01:43:58,011 --> 01:44:02,780
I know, Dude, this is a horse horses Dick
for an hour, for a billion hours. My bad.

1750
01:44:02,781 --> 01:44:04,250
I should have never said that man.

1751
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:07,510
We don't have to actually suck it for
a whole hour because it probably won't

1752
01:44:07,511 --> 01:44:09,470
take that long.
But you're committed.

1753
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:12,770
You're committed to us it for one
hour a horse or can be a pony.

1754
01:44:16,370 --> 01:44:17,203
I was thinking,

1755
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:23,810
I was thinking like that's how
juvenile I am Ghana. Um, so juvenile,

1756
01:44:23,811 --> 01:44:25,580
that was the funniest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

1757
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:29,690
You just pause for a second picture.
You blowing a pony.

1758
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:34,280
That's all I can think of.
The polling was Brown and white too.

1759
01:44:34,281 --> 01:44:38,460
It was really cute. Wow, great. Sort
of like I had red ribbons in hair.

1760
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:40,760
I was like,
why does it have red ribbon?

1761
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:44,570
But isn't about little kids that love
ponies and horses and shit like that.

1762
01:44:44,571 --> 01:44:49,520
What is it, man? No idea.
Habits. Having little kids,
man. My daughter loves horses.

1763
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:52,170
She loves horses and ponies.
Like all little girls,

1764
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:55,300
some nice animal that you can
ride. It's like, that's like,

1765
01:44:55,510 --> 01:44:58,940
but she doesn't know you can ride
it. What? She doesn't know she's too,

1766
01:44:59,030 --> 01:45:01,460
she doesn't know you could ride a
fucking horse. That's ridiculous.

1767
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:05,270
There seen somebody at a fair,
she's seen Barbie. Barbie, right?

1768
01:45:05,271 --> 01:45:08,190
Maybe she seen it on movies and movies.

1769
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:12,860
Animated movies for no reason.
But what it is it about girls and horses?

1770
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,550
What do you think? It's something
sexual. Absolutely. They,

1771
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:20,090
I've talked to a few people before and
they all say it feels fucking great.

1772
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:23,420
Yeah, it's, it's constantly
rubbing their pussy.

1773
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:26,780
I look at where their sexual organs are.
It's like they're constantly titty.

1774
01:45:26,781 --> 01:45:27,620
Fucking that horse.

1775
01:45:27,650 --> 01:45:30,730
Why do you think like I live in
equestrian district and why did,

1776
01:45:30,731 --> 01:45:32,210
and then like every
time I go to Starbucks,

1777
01:45:32,211 --> 01:45:33,800
there's at least four of them in there.

1778
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:38,250
They are always plain Jane girls
because they can't get any dick.

1779
01:45:38,251 --> 01:45:41,240
So they fucking ride horses.
They're never hot.

1780
01:45:41,241 --> 01:45:44,780
Supermodels are never fucking fat chicks.
Plain Jane Girls.

1781
01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:49,340
I will make you stop riding horses.
I agree.

1782
01:45:50,690 --> 01:45:55,690
And I don't believe he believed that all
of the women that rubbing horses around

1783
01:45:56,631 --> 01:45:56,961
me,

1784
01:45:56,961 --> 01:46:00,350
all the women in my neighborhood who ride
horses look like they're getting away

1785
01:46:00,351 --> 01:46:04,440
with something. They're like, there's
a dog looking at fairs like smirking

1786
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,700
while they're nothing in their gene

1787
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:15,860
brown muscle underneath, I'm just, and
it's moving clip clop clop clop clip

1788
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:21,570
watching iPhone porn as a riding the,
the,

1789
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:26,670
the standard excuse for why
a woman lost her hymen. Her,

1790
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:30,140
her number one, the number one excuse was,
oh, she lost it. Horseback riding. Right.

1791
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:33,830
Did you know that? Because you
know, it was always, hey, you know,

1792
01:46:33,831 --> 01:46:35,990
they checked to make sure our
virgin, what's going on? Hooker.

1793
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:39,650
You've been getting Dick stuffed in
there? No, I ride horses like, Oh, okay.

1794
01:46:39,651 --> 01:46:43,010
That's cool. Wow. So it
was legit to buster. Yeah.

1795
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:46,670
Legit to bust your hymen and bust a nut.
I bet they do.

1796
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:49,520
I'd been used to carve out their
saddles and make a little hole.

1797
01:46:49,521 --> 01:46:50,360
So when they write really

1798
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:54,930
did they? Yeah, just stick
your Dick in there. He just
made that up. He fucked this.

1799
01:46:54,931 --> 01:46:56,180
What I would do.
Is that what you mean?

1800
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:58,680
Damn fuck yeah. I wouldn't
think of something like
that. Make a fleshlight some.

1801
01:46:58,690 --> 01:47:00,010
How do I attach to my sad,

1802
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:03,660
sad thing that you're supposed
to hold on a long road trip?

1803
01:47:03,661 --> 01:47:05,580
You jerk off the whole time.

1804
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,120
I've jerked off once in a car that I
can remember. I think I did it again.

1805
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:12,990
I definitely did it once though and then
while I was working and I remember very

1806
01:47:12,991 --> 01:47:16,530
clearly after I came thinking I'm
definitely going to do this again.

1807
01:47:16,531 --> 01:47:19,140
I'm such an idiot.
Like being disappointed with myself,

1808
01:47:19,410 --> 01:47:22,200
like go and I know I'll be doing it
like it's not like I just jerked off all

1809
01:47:22,201 --> 01:47:25,950
over myself while I'm driving once like
this is going to be a regular occurrence.

1810
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:28,590
So I'm thinking this is eventually
going to become embarrassing for me.

1811
01:47:29,970 --> 01:47:32,640
But then what happened? Man, I just never
did it again. I don't know what happened.

1812
01:47:32,641 --> 01:47:37,530
I never will. I guess maybe I just
rationalized, I look, looked it like,

1813
01:47:38,690 --> 01:47:42,090
am I really that horny or
am I just looking to be
distracted while I'm driving?

1814
01:47:42,091 --> 01:47:44,990
Like what am I doing? You know,
this is stupid. This is life.

1815
01:47:44,991 --> 01:47:45,990
Fourth time management.

1816
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:50,830
Let this hard to look at your
gps and imagine it to girl. No,

1817
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:56,350
didn't you have a chick that got jealous?
Because my gps voice, listen to this.

1818
01:47:56,500 --> 01:48:01,500
He had a fucking gps than where it was
an English woman's voice and his girl got

1819
01:48:01,691 --> 01:48:04,720
jealous and she kept on
making me change it to guys.

1820
01:48:04,721 --> 01:48:06,700
And then like I would download
like the British chick,

1821
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:09,580
it was a Tom Tom and a download like
the British chick and she'd be like,

1822
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:13,890
what the fuck is this chick? Just turn
it to the regular guy. This is what,

1823
01:48:13,891 --> 01:48:15,580
what do you think that she's hot.
What is it

1824
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:18,873
dad?

1825
01:48:19,310 --> 01:48:20,800
Really?
Yeah.

1826
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:24,680
And so what kind of a
hell where you live in?

1827
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:28,390
Was it a fiery lava?

1828
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:33,250
GPS came out hot sticker up the
ass. Hell, tell me about that thing.

1829
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:36,760
It was just when gps came out and for some
reason it had annoyed her. She's like,

1830
01:48:36,761 --> 01:48:40,150
didn't like that it was a girl talking,
but she was just like,

1831
01:48:40,151 --> 01:48:42,580
you think she sounds hot?
She asked why.

1832
01:48:42,581 --> 01:48:44,680
I just didn't have like
a normal guy voice.

1833
01:48:44,681 --> 01:48:47,770
She thought it was odd that
I always made it like a sexy,

1834
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,650
you know like Asian girls speaking
English voice or whatever.

1835
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:55,450
Whoever they have that I have, they
have like British woman, you Kay,

1836
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:59,230
you know Asian American, Asian,
Asian. Did you ever do it? Yeah.

1837
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:01,810
Did you ever get to the point where
you were hearing that we were going,

1838
01:49:01,870 --> 01:49:03,190
I have to get out of this relationship?

1839
01:49:03,230 --> 01:49:06,740
No. It came out to the point where they
had it where you could make your own

1840
01:49:06,770 --> 01:49:08,480
recordings of it and

1841
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:14,200
thank you man. No, I did I,

1842
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:18,940
why would I want to hear myself talk
to me? No, but I want to hear the shit.

1843
01:49:19,530 --> 01:49:24,420
I'm like, thanks lady. Or I want to be
like, yeah, thanks baby. Like you know

1844
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:27,830
I did it. So it's like turn
the fuck up here. You know,

1845
01:49:27,831 --> 01:49:31,160
I just cussed and stuff and
she was happy with that. Yeah.

1846
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:35,270
What was she do broke up after? I think
around it. I would have broke over that.

1847
01:49:35,330 --> 01:49:40,070
Oh my God, would it, I would have kicked
her out of the car. It was still moving.

1848
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:42,530
Have you ever kicked the girl in the car?
Yeah.

1849
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:47,340
No. He told me what he said. Yeah.

1850
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:52,990
Yeah. But what you're really
saying was of course stupid. Yeah.

1851
01:49:52,991 --> 01:49:56,830
And I was saying of course too, but that
was my next thing. Of course. Of course.

1852
01:49:56,831 --> 01:49:59,500
How many, how many? I've only
kicked out one girl on my car ever.

1853
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:02,230
I think it was like high school
time though. Like I was like, dude,

1854
01:50:02,830 --> 01:50:03,730
get out of my car.

1855
01:50:03,731 --> 01:50:08,560
Like it was like little kids that have
one crazy bitch I did when I was 21 just

1856
01:50:08,561 --> 01:50:12,550
off the top. Just love to fight.
Just loved to, for whatever reason,

1857
01:50:12,551 --> 01:50:15,160
just start picking fights.
When you date people,

1858
01:50:15,161 --> 01:50:18,670
you figure out like some people are out
of their minds. Oh, this one was nuts.

1859
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:22,060
She used to like to fight and then
she used to like me to go, hey,

1860
01:50:22,150 --> 01:50:25,890
what the fuck is wrong with you? Like
stop picking on me. Stop yelling at me.

1861
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:28,940
Just fucking chill out. You're
acting like an asshole, right?

1862
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:32,260
I'm not doing anything to you.
And then she would go super submissive,

1863
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:35,390
was really crazy and then want
to fuck that was like hers.

1864
01:50:35,410 --> 01:50:39,910
There's constant strategy.
So after a while it was like
she wanted to be handled.

1865
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:41,500
So she wanted a rise up.

1866
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:43,810
She wanted to say shitty things
and intuitive would build.

1867
01:50:43,811 --> 01:50:47,320
She would start with like a little insult
and then it would go on and I would

1868
01:50:47,321 --> 01:50:50,140
ignore it. I would try to just
like, please, let's not fight.

1869
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:52,990
And then we get to the point where she
would say something really stupid and I

1870
01:50:52,991 --> 01:50:55,630
have to go, hey, what the fuck are you
doing? Are We, do we like each other?

1871
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:58,690
Why are you talking to me like this?
Like, what's going on here? This is dumb,

1872
01:50:58,691 --> 01:51:02,950
dumb shit like you, you're, you're
not, you're not honoring my feelings.

1873
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:05,680
And then she would go, I'm
sorry. You're right. I'm sorry.

1874
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:09,130
Fuck coming out all I'm a loser or you
don't know what's wrong and then it would

1875
01:51:09,131 --> 01:51:11,340
just, you would want to crash
and she'd want me to fuck her.

1876
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:18,160
I take the same route. Girls,
it's a sort of like a, you know,

1877
01:51:18,161 --> 01:51:23,140
it's like a distraction. Sexual reward
or you want to fight? Well it's just,

1878
01:51:23,141 --> 01:51:25,510
they also have that pattern.
It's usually they, the,

1879
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:27,460
every relationship they've had is that,
that pattern.

1880
01:51:27,610 --> 01:51:31,360
They have drama with their friends.
They usually have drama at home.

1881
01:51:31,361 --> 01:51:35,530
It's like some people become addicted
to drama and the big thrill you get from

1882
01:51:35,531 --> 01:51:36,970
sort of overcoming drama.

1883
01:51:36,971 --> 01:51:40,330
You know how many dudes you know that
just like you have to fucking get in a

1884
01:51:40,331 --> 01:51:43,270
yelling match with this asshole before
you can be friends with them. You have,

1885
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:45,710
I mean, how many guys have you ever
met? I mean our circles and circles of,

1886
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:49,390
of the guys who train in MMA guys
and high testosterone individuals.

1887
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:52,390
There was always this one guy, we
have to go, Bro, what the fuck?

1888
01:51:52,630 --> 01:51:56,900
And then he's okay. He turned to
say that about me right now. No,

1889
01:51:57,030 --> 01:51:59,670
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding though.

1890
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:03,040
What the fuck that sounds
like something else

1891
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:07,600
did I do. It's the shit, isn't it?

1892
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:10,780
I got to fucking complaint
from a young man on Twitter.

1893
01:52:10,940 --> 01:52:13,930
What saying that the coconut juice,
I was steering him wrong.

1894
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:17,620
That coconut juice tastes like shit. Yeah,
well he's got to get the right stuff.

1895
01:52:17,650 --> 01:52:19,810
You got to get the right
stuff and you know,

1896
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:22,480
I bet there's some people that they're
like, man, I like mountain dew. Gold.

1897
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:27,270
Joe Rogan made me smoke, you know, drink
coconut juice, mountain dew, Goldman.

1898
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:29,330
I don't have a problem out and Duke.
No.

1899
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:32,160
You know what I'm saying there that
they're just like whatever they do,

1900
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:35,950
they drink mountain dew every day and
that's it. You know think guys like that,

1901
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:39,700
like the people that same people that
make fun of me for enjoying grape vodka.

1902
01:52:39,730 --> 01:52:43,330
What do you like flavored vodka?
You need to drink Budweiser.

1903
01:52:43,930 --> 01:52:46,040
I'm sorry for dropping theF bomb again.
You can say whatever

1904
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,930
you want. Oh, I'm allowed to do
that. Yeah. I don't care. I retired.

1905
01:52:48,931 --> 01:52:53,690
Not because I saw that.
I know I stopped doing it too.

1906
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:54,651
Yeah,
you be.

1907
01:52:54,651 --> 01:52:57,800
Only because Glenn and I want to say it
sometimes cause I'm used to it cause to

1908
01:52:57,801 --> 01:53:01,580
me it means something way different.
Yeah. I saw that show Louie's uh,

1909
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:06,350
Louie and I saw the guy and I was
like, ah. I was like, oh I get it now.

1910
01:53:06,351 --> 01:53:09,620
I see why the gay people,
I hate that word because not correct,

1911
01:53:09,621 --> 01:53:14,540
but it's Ph now based stuff to them. It's
like real hateful heart. And I'm like,

1912
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:17,720
oh to me it's like what we say
when we were little kids like,

1913
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:22,000
like you're just like whatever. Fuck. Like
you don't mean it at anything. Get like,

1914
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:25,400
I've been saying it for so long, I
say, well that was a great scene.

1915
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:26,160
But what,

1916
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:29,450
what I was saying is not correct as a new
saint at the origin of the word faggot

1917
01:53:29,451 --> 01:53:33,410
meant that it was, you would throw them
on the fire just like faggots of wood.

1918
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:34,640
Oh that's not,
no,

1919
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:39,410
that's not the correct with the call
entomology entomology now the correct one

1920
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,150
is that a faggot,

1921
01:53:41,210 --> 01:53:45,170
like a bundle of wood was a burden
and it was difficult to carry.

1922
01:53:45,171 --> 01:53:47,390
So a woman became a faggot.

1923
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:51,920
So women were faggots of wood
that was difficult to carry.

1924
01:53:51,921 --> 01:53:55,760
They became burdensome. And then when
they would talk about guys who were gay,

1925
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:58,040
they would call them faggots too,
because they were women.

1926
01:53:58,070 --> 01:54:00,410
They were just looking at him. He's
a faggot. He's a burden. Some woman.

1927
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:03,390
Yeah, that's what the correct
calling Jason's Mama Fag.

1928
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:05,560
It was actually proper
terminology. Yeah. I don't know.

1929
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:07,280
His mom was a burdensome woman.

1930
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:10,610
She might've been a joy to be
around and a wonderful companion,

1931
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:15,170
like a bundle of wood. I don't know.
So that's, but either way. Yeah,

1932
01:54:15,171 --> 01:54:18,410
it's a problem is that it has a
different definition for gay people.

1933
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:20,900
That's fine.
That's the only reason that I'm,

1934
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:23,530
I don't want to say because all my bags,
when did you,

1935
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:27,820
how long ago did you retire? I Dunno,
a while ago. That's really, uh,

1936
01:54:28,510 --> 01:54:30,380
I saw that.
And then not because they did,

1937
01:54:30,381 --> 01:54:33,290
it took a while I thought and I
thought about it and I'm like, yeah,

1938
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:37,820
that is like hate, like hateful
word, like such a to them.

1939
01:54:37,821 --> 01:54:40,550
And to me it's not that way.
And I understand why people say it.

1940
01:54:40,551 --> 01:54:44,010
Because when you want to like just
inspect the dude as much as you can.

1941
01:54:44,011 --> 01:54:46,280
Didn't you just say that?
But you're not thinking you're gay.

1942
01:54:46,281 --> 01:54:50,600
Like it just has a nice ring to it.
It just sounds like mean.

1943
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:53,750
That's why people, you know,
it sounds very dismissive.

1944
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:56,640
Ever said it to a gay dude ever.
I don't think. I never ever,

1945
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:00,890
let me see can that great joke about it.
Unless he was being a faggot

1946
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,890
and he said something about did you all
the people from Phoenix or Phoenicians

1947
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:11,570
shut up you faggot. Hey,
how about the sand anymore?

1948
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:15,950
I'm just quoting Louie CK. Oh,
you're just gonna start quoting.

1949
01:55:15,951 --> 01:55:20,540
People just want to do, and it keeps
saying Faggot by bringing up that,

1950
01:55:20,541 --> 01:55:21,374
I'm not saying it

1951
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:31,280
until the end of time,
so it's another what?

1952
01:55:31,340 --> 01:55:33,200
You're not gonna I'm not
going to ignore topics.

1953
01:55:33,201 --> 01:55:35,900
We're not going to protect our
real ladies and gentlemen. Okay.

1954
01:55:35,901 --> 01:55:38,990
All I'm saying is I'm not going
to use it as a slander, as a slur.

1955
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:42,080
It's not a slanders. You're going to
be mad at somebody. You can be like,

1956
01:55:42,110 --> 01:55:44,190
if I didn't retire,
were faggot right

1957
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:47,780
now with the proper time to use
one.

1958
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:51,570
If I can still save faggotry cause
that's not even the same word.

1959
01:55:52,090 --> 01:55:56,070
That's like saying niggardly. You know
that's the judge is a tricky word.

1960
01:55:56,071 --> 01:55:58,870
That's a step mean.
Stingy. There's no origins.

1961
01:55:59,270 --> 01:56:02,760
It's not at all. Not at
all. I know. It's so weird.

1962
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:08,190
It's closing occur. I said
it. I don't give a fuck.

1963
01:56:08,310 --> 01:56:11,400
I'm not calling anybody in it. That
means we're just missing. It's real.

1964
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:13,470
So you're more, you're
more scared of gay? No,

1965
01:56:13,471 --> 01:56:17,340
I'm not saying I'm not calling anyone it.
I'm just saying that it's a word.

1966
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:19,410
Sometimes when you're
talking about the n word,

1967
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:23,830
it's more offensive to me to
say the n word. Oh Gee. Oh here.

1968
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:26,880
What should we go sit your,

1969
01:56:27,210 --> 01:56:30,720
we're going again with you
fucking terrible person.

1970
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:36,150
Did you call someone that's
mom faggot. Oh, I did not.

1971
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:39,810
You called my mom a faggot, bro.
And I know Jason Forgot about it.

1972
01:56:39,811 --> 01:56:41,790
Or your mom he bought,
he called his mom.

1973
01:56:42,150 --> 01:56:46,070
His mom's gay and he calls his Mama
Faggot. Oh really? Oh Brian did.

1974
01:56:46,071 --> 01:56:49,800
He just didn't give a fuck. Look at
him. He's reckless or whatever. Brian,

1975
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:52,530
Brian's doing standard. Does she have
like a short haircut or something?

1976
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:56,370
Now she's going to say less
real live lesbian.

1977
01:56:56,371 --> 01:56:59,370
He's running around calling her a
faggot. Why? Cause that's Brian.

1978
01:56:59,371 --> 01:57:02,550
That's how he rolls. He doesn't give any
other reason. I called your Mama Faggot.

1979
01:57:02,730 --> 01:57:05,700
Yeah. Why you call it felt
is tight like an asshole.

1980
01:57:06,990 --> 01:57:11,130
Why she was tight like
an asshole. Brian. Ma'Am.

1981
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:13,680
This is the worst show stopper.
And you've ever thrown out.

1982
01:57:14,010 --> 01:57:18,570
Why would you say that to May Hams? Mom.
Dude, my mom downloaded the podcast.

1983
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:23,660
Does your mom downloaded
podcasts? Oh Bro. Brian,

1984
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:27,540
what did you just do? You're going
to have to go back and edit this.

1985
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:31,890
This is going to be the lot.
A lot. Somebody tweeted me.

1986
01:57:31,891 --> 01:57:35,330
The time here wakes up and
like four hours bro. Oh,

1987
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:38,750
how dare you man does
not cool. Not, oh. Oh.

1988
01:57:38,770 --> 01:57:42,060
What error and she's very sensitive
about. I'm sure that's a good thing. I've,

1989
01:57:42,061 --> 01:57:45,120
she was sitting around and at least you
didn't say, he didn't say I was sloppy.

1990
01:57:45,121 --> 01:57:46,920
You know,
they're seen probably is happy,

1991
01:57:46,950 --> 01:57:50,940
but you're insinuating he fucked his
mom. I did not. You didn't fuck my mom.

1992
01:57:55,050 --> 01:57:57,640
She said you guys talked on Twitter.
Huh?

1993
01:57:58,230 --> 01:58:02,220
My Mom said you guys talked about too
was how crazy is that Lebron James Story

1994
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:07,110
for one of his, one of his teammates
was fucking his mom. Yeah. That's crazy.

1995
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:08,570
Do you know that story?
Wow.

1996
01:58:08,610 --> 01:58:12,690
One of Lebron's teammates
was flopping his mom.

1997
01:58:15,150 --> 01:58:19,770
That's gotta be rough weight and what
team? The Miami Heat. Yeah, whatever.

1998
01:58:20,070 --> 01:58:23,580
No, the other one. Oh yeah. Yeah.
A lot to do up there in Cleveland.

1999
01:58:23,581 --> 01:58:27,810
So they just fuck people's moms.
This to be a lot of things ahead of,

2000
01:58:27,811 --> 01:58:29,970
fuck this guy's mom, I'm
from Columbus. That's true.

2001
01:58:29,971 --> 01:58:31,500
We just fuck each other's moms.

2002
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:35,550
How would that be you when it gets
to be like my member December, like

2003
01:58:38,850 --> 01:58:41,790
that's where I met her
fucking married.

2004
01:58:42,730 --> 01:58:47,560
Where? That's where I met her
in this call. This is horrible.

2005
01:58:47,561 --> 01:58:51,670
So crammed. My Mom's going to be pissed
off. This black gay man misses mayhem.

2006
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:54,610
I'm sorry. Yeah. For my friend Brian,

2007
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:57,280
most of what he says is
just for comedic value.

2008
01:58:57,281 --> 01:58:59,170
He doesn't really mean
that this whole thing is,

2009
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:01,420
you can't take anything
serious on that stone.

2010
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:03,700
I would like to kiss her on the Buckeye.
It's ridiculous.

2011
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,840
Please don't take anything I say
ever anywhere. Seriously. I know.

2012
01:59:07,870 --> 01:59:11,500
That's the problem I have is not worth it.
It's not worth it.

2013
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:15,320
It's too much of an investment.
Right. It's, you know,

2014
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:19,930
I wouldn't take anything I said seriously.
You don't need to as well. It's fun.

2015
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:23,440
Yeah. I mean that's what the
beauty of a podcast are folks.

2016
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:27,880
Getting a little window into a retarded
conversation that Ma'am and I would have

2017
01:59:27,881 --> 01:59:31,820
probably had with or without
you, right? Fuck yeah.

2018
01:59:31,930 --> 01:59:33,880
That's one of the coolest
things about doing this podcast.

2019
01:59:33,881 --> 01:59:37,780
This is basically hanging out with
your friends except other people all

2020
01:59:37,781 --> 01:59:39,700
throughout the world and I'll tell you,
man,

2021
01:59:39,701 --> 01:59:44,701
I've gotten all these fucking emails and
I met all these people that tell me how

2022
01:59:45,370 --> 01:59:48,820
they don't have anybody like these people.
I don't know anyone like you are.

2023
01:59:48,821 --> 01:59:51,430
Like a lot of the guests that I have,
they don't know these fucking people.

2024
01:59:51,431 --> 01:59:54,380
They don't have anyone like this in the
light. I don't have by listening to this,

2025
01:59:54,430 --> 01:59:57,860
they don't have people to talk but
listen to this thing three, you know,

2026
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:00,430
four hours every, you
know, every week or so.

2027
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:04,480
You get all these weird different people,
you know,

2028
02:00:04,481 --> 02:00:06,610
become a part of your daily conversations.

2029
02:00:07,030 --> 02:00:10,640
This is like super hyper accelerating
shit for some people, you know,

2030
02:00:10,641 --> 02:00:14,230
from people that are living in and
shitty places where they have, you know,

2031
02:00:14,231 --> 02:00:18,070
poor conversations with people and they,
they, they long for someone who can,

2032
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:20,310
you know,
bring challenging ideas.

2033
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:24,640
There had radio has always
been like a format of like um,

2034
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:29,590
like mark people I think or people
who were like, you want to like,

2035
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:34,830
well yeah, communication, you
know, communication. Yeah, exactly.

2036
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:36,640
I mean there's obviously
a lot of bad shit,

2037
02:00:36,641 --> 02:00:41,440
like a lot of the right wing Rah
Rah talk radio for those people.

2038
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:43,430
You know what I mean?
Like they want to Ra.

2039
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:45,190
The people want something
to rally against.

2040
02:00:45,191 --> 02:00:48,910
People want something to be a part
of. So you know, we all do. I do.

2041
02:00:48,911 --> 02:00:52,810
I always wanted to win a radio call
in contest. I always want to be here.

2042
02:00:52,811 --> 02:00:57,610
My name on the radio when I was driving
somewhere. Dude, you should totally post.

2043
02:00:57,670 --> 02:01:00,490
You should totally host some sort
of a regular radio show. What?

2044
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:02,410
You could totally do.
Something like that.

2045
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:07,200
What Jay host some sort of a
regular radio show. MMA hour. Yeah.

2046
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:09,310
You could also crank up a podcast.

2047
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:12,370
You could totally do something like
for serious or something like that.

2048
02:01:12,430 --> 02:01:15,050
It's got bellowing. You're
doing it just, yeah.

2049
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:20,110
I didn't even know that one time a week.
Just throw it in one time a week.

2050
02:01:20,111 --> 02:01:23,430
Do it for an hour. Are you offering me
a job at Sirius? Right. I'm telling you,

2051
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:27,340
Bryan. Bryan can set up a podcast for
you. He has a little podcast studio,

2052
02:01:27,341 --> 02:01:28,930
red band studios in his house.

2053
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:33,010
He's rocking right now and we did one
with Tom [inaudible] and his lovely wife

2054
02:01:33,011 --> 02:01:35,200
the other day.
He's done it with Ari and Jason.

2055
02:01:35,201 --> 02:01:40,100
We have a new one coming up with Sam Aaa.
It's all about zombies. Really? Yeah.

2056
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:43,660
Zombies. Yeah. Sam Tripoli's
doing a Zombie podcast,

2057
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:48,350
starting 24 can you say about zombies? I
don't know. It's going to be interesting.

2058
02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:52,100
Pilots. They're all pride. I
predicted by episode three,

2059
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:55,910
he'll just start calling people a Zombie
so I could talk shit about George Bush.

2060
02:01:55,911 --> 02:01:58,130
He's a Zombie seem on TV.
Good fucking,

2061
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:00,860
it's kind of like that one I used to
do with the podcasts with Joey Diaz.

2062
02:02:00,861 --> 02:02:04,700
It was all about cats, but like, hey, so
let's talk about cat litter. Oh, anyways,

2063
02:02:04,701 --> 02:02:08,930
he used to rape guys, you know, they
do with cats, you know, it's just,

2064
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:12,050
I've never listened to Joe. He's podcasts,
but it's called beauty and the beast.

2065
02:02:12,051 --> 02:02:15,650
Right? Yeah. How is it? Uh, yeah, it's
pretty good. I like it. I like it. Uh,

2066
02:02:15,651 --> 02:02:18,650
that girls has such a cute voice. I
could listen to her all day, you know,

2067
02:02:18,700 --> 02:02:20,960
just does he get as worked
up when he's with her?

2068
02:02:20,990 --> 02:02:24,600
Does he get crazy and start yelling and
shit? And sometimes, yeah, it's, it's,

2069
02:02:24,601 --> 02:02:29,440
you know, it's exactly what you'd
expect to ATS to be. I mean, you know,

2070
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:32,180
who was a big fan of that? It's
Ms. Miller. Ms. Miller used to

2071
02:02:35,570 --> 02:02:39,230
drive home, you know, you
called her miss. Ms. Miller. Mrs

2072
02:02:41,060 --> 02:02:45,090
Ms. Remember that shift for a while?
You're trying to rock ms Ms,

2073
02:02:45,870 --> 02:02:48,820
you don't know what I am still to this.

2074
02:02:48,910 --> 02:02:52,690
That's one of those things I just haven't
cared enough about to like learn the,

2075
02:02:52,940 --> 02:02:55,910
yeah, the metric system. This is
the missus and the Moose slurs.

2076
02:02:56,710 --> 02:03:01,380
I still don't know one for men.
Mister [inaudible].

2077
02:03:02,270 --> 02:03:05,560
You don't even think about voting right
when voting comes around you like what?

2078
02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:08,720
Don't give a phone now.
I don't want any court dates.

2079
02:03:08,721 --> 02:03:10,640
I don't want to get audited or any,

2080
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:13,310
I don't want to be in the
system as much as possible.

2081
02:03:13,311 --> 02:03:18,080
Like did you just hear that the government
just closed down like 80 websites the

2082
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:21,830
other day? Just pull them
off the Internet. They sell
on a bunch of pirated shit.

2083
02:03:21,980 --> 02:03:23,840
So,
I mean,

2084
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:29,250
can you just overtake somebody that has,
you know, you know at Torrance are right.

2085
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:32,480
They're not. Was that what it does?
It was towards torrent websites.

2086
02:03:32,790 --> 02:03:35,090
More also like a piracy web sites,

2087
02:03:35,091 --> 02:03:38,360
like where people were selling like
counterfeit jewelry and shoes maybe.

2088
02:03:38,361 --> 02:03:41,780
But it's still kind of weird that they're
allowed to just go Bam. I, you know,

2089
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:44,140
I know what you're saying.
Weird. Well it, you know,

2090
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:47,360
obviously it is and it's once they
can start shutting down websites,

2091
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:52,570
but if they're doing, see
that's the tricky thing, like
a lot of people, you know,

2092
02:03:52,610 --> 02:03:56,990
you got to recognize that the courts have
decided that torrents and downloading

2093
02:03:56,991 --> 02:04:00,860
copyrighted material is uh, is
stealing, you know, I mean that's,

2094
02:04:00,861 --> 02:04:01,850
that's how they're looking at it.

2095
02:04:01,970 --> 02:04:05,840
So if the courts or if they've
made decisions like that
and then you're going to

2096
02:04:05,841 --> 02:04:09,410
run a website or some sort of a torrent
site, where are you going to, you know,

2097
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:11,810
get people access to a
bunch of illegal shit?

2098
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:15,440
You got to assume that
eventually someone's going to
shut you down. Right? Right.

2099
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:18,290
Well look,
the Pirate Bay,

2100
02:04:18,291 --> 02:04:20,230
I don't know if got you saw that
they just went back last year.

2101
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:24,380
I lost and then they lost the rebuttal
or whatever it's called and now they're

2102
02:04:24,590 --> 02:04:28,670
going to jail. And it's, the
website's still up though.
And I mean it's like, wait,

2103
02:04:29,210 --> 02:04:33,390
so some people are going to jail. Yeah.
And then they just tore down all those,

2104
02:04:33,580 --> 02:04:36,620
those guys make money. How does
something like that advertising, man,

2105
02:04:36,621 --> 02:04:39,240
there's so much advertising on
that website. It's ridiculous.

2106
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:42,300
People pay just to have an ad
there cause nobody pays attention.

2107
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:44,480
I was fucking ads. Right,
right. You don't do,

2108
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:46,470
when you go to the website was
the last time you clicked an ad.

2109
02:04:46,770 --> 02:04:49,790
Some has to be absolutely
fucking outstanding. Interesting.

2110
02:04:50,390 --> 02:04:53,520
They're the kind that you just go
there and it says congratulations.

2111
02:04:53,521 --> 02:04:58,110
You won a gift card to the olive garden.
Click here. So it's crappy. Like websites.

2112
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:02,460
Yeah. Nobody like legitimate,
but they're paying them.

2113
02:05:02,461 --> 02:05:04,530
They must be paying a
mad loop. Right. I Dunno.

2114
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:07,050
Order for them to be fighting
this like this. They're not.

2115
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:09,690
So you think they're just finding
it just because they want freedom.

2116
02:05:09,720 --> 02:05:13,140
They want to be able to just
trade numbers. I don't know.

2117
02:05:13,141 --> 02:05:17,230
And that's all it is really. I think
that's the whole point of, you know it,

2118
02:05:17,670 --> 02:05:20,180
you can't bust somebody for having,
you know,

2119
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:24,000
you can't bust somebody for stealing
of whatever, a milli Vanilli CD.

2120
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:27,510
If you don't have the Milli Vanilli
city on something you're serving,

2121
02:05:27,511 --> 02:05:30,450
you're just pointing it to all these
different directions. You know?

2122
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:33,370
I see what you're saying.
It's like Torrance. Yeah.

2123
02:05:33,371 --> 02:05:35,420
If you're going right to
the beautiful, yeah. Yeah.

2124
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:39,150
Like torrents are just using like you
have a piece of a file on your computer.

2125
02:05:39,151 --> 02:05:42,030
Somebody else has a piece of complete
file on their computer and all of this

2126
02:05:42,031 --> 02:05:43,740
website like pirate base pointing like,
Hey,

2127
02:05:43,741 --> 02:05:48,180
this is where to go to join this other
way to walk down the hallway down there.

2128
02:05:48,181 --> 02:05:49,350
They're walking down his group,

2129
02:05:49,351 --> 02:05:52,470
but it's coming from someone who already
bought it and they should be able to

2130
02:05:52,471 --> 02:05:55,920
give it away. Is that what
you're saying? No, no.

2131
02:05:55,921 --> 02:06:00,090
I'm just saying what am I
someone somewhere or another
somewhere had to attain a

2132
02:06:00,091 --> 02:06:04,020
copy. Yeah, absolutely. Man. Know what
I'm saying? I'm saying that they stole it.

2133
02:06:04,050 --> 02:06:05,450
I'm saying what's scary
about the pirate band?

2134
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:07,080
What's scary about a lot of these places?

2135
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:09,960
If they don't actually have files on their
computer and they're getting arrested

2136
02:06:09,961 --> 02:06:11,430
for things and what makes it stop,

2137
02:06:11,431 --> 02:06:15,600
then you know like you getting arrested
because somebody put a torrent file on

2138
02:06:15,601 --> 02:06:19,380
your form. Even though, even though
it's not hosting anything, computers,

2139
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:23,940
their whole entire purpose for existing
on the Internet is to connect people

2140
02:06:24,060 --> 02:06:27,990
with other people that are selling
things available for download that are

2141
02:06:27,991 --> 02:06:29,500
illegal. Yeah. But uh, you,

2142
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:32,850
so Google has maps and then it tells
you where to go to murder people if you

2143
02:06:32,851 --> 02:06:35,600
want anything at all. But that's
okay though. The whole PR,

2144
02:06:35,630 --> 02:06:39,570
I mean it's not like Google's
called murder Google, but you can,

2145
02:06:39,610 --> 02:06:42,410
you can lose advertising or
hey check and they got murder.

2146
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:46,130
google.com I want to start
that serial killer Google.

2147
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:49,050
I see what you're saying.
I totally see what you're saying.

2148
02:06:49,410 --> 02:06:52,360
But I I also see like
that, you know, they,

2149
02:06:53,010 --> 02:06:57,300
if these companies look for sure a
music companies have suffered big time

2150
02:06:57,301 --> 02:07:01,110
because of the Internet going
to shake it up eventually.

2151
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:05,640
If cit is like for me clicking on
Itunes, it's so easy. Then I go,

2152
02:07:05,641 --> 02:07:08,100
okay I'll just click on iTunes. Me
Too. You know what I'm saying? Like,

2153
02:07:08,110 --> 02:07:10,230
I'll just buy it because,
and not cause you know,

2154
02:07:10,231 --> 02:07:13,200
cause I have a boatload of money cause
I would buy about the same amount of

2155
02:07:13,201 --> 02:07:14,310
music as I do now.

2156
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:19,520
But like if I was like super poor
but like it's like so easy to do.

2157
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:21,080
I don't even want to feel that.

2158
02:07:21,081 --> 02:07:24,600
The only time I ever downloaded something
is when it's not available for sale.

2159
02:07:25,110 --> 02:07:29,200
You know, if I can buy it, I buy it or
when it's not out yet, it's just there.

2160
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:33,870
They're finding that equalized
like pressure and I think
that that tows torrent

2161
02:07:33,871 --> 02:07:36,130
files. That's an awesome
technology. Like they

2162
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:40,270
need to, you know, use that and
legal ways. You know what I mean?

2163
02:07:40,271 --> 02:07:43,150
Like that's just how it is.
It's, it's a, it's a whole,

2164
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:46,900
the whole issue is a very tricky issue
because on one side you have to say,

2165
02:07:46,901 --> 02:07:47,320
well this,

2166
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:51,940
you're stifling innovation by stopping
these people from doing all this stuff

2167
02:07:51,941 --> 02:07:54,940
and by putting the brakes on all these
sites. But the other side he'd go,

2168
02:07:54,941 --> 02:07:57,190
well wait a minute, how the fuck are
these people supposed to make money?

2169
02:07:57,310 --> 02:08:01,630
You can't just have something for free
that I want to sell for $20 on amazon.com

2170
02:08:01,631 --> 02:08:05,800
you can download it and Tim, what I'm
thinking is it's the same as, oh my God,

2171
02:08:05,801 --> 02:08:09,250
like cds are gonna gonna make
everybody, you know, writeable cds.

2172
02:08:09,251 --> 02:08:12,010
It's going to ruin it
for the music industry.

2173
02:08:12,011 --> 02:08:13,810
Now they got to find an
equal pressure where,

2174
02:08:14,050 --> 02:08:16,420
where the cds did a little bit of a dent,

2175
02:08:16,450 --> 02:08:19,900
but of course the big dent was done by
the Internet. Yeah, of course. I mean,

2176
02:08:19,901 --> 02:08:22,210
look man, do you remember when there
were selling like v record stores,

2177
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:26,050
but they want to rent her now. It's
so easy just to click, you know,

2178
02:08:26,051 --> 02:08:29,140
life is getting better, but you know,
some people are going to suffer for sure.

2179
02:08:29,370 --> 02:08:30,161
Yeah,
I'm lucky.

2180
02:08:30,161 --> 02:08:33,730
I live right across the street from a
record store that does used records and

2181
02:08:33,731 --> 02:08:35,260
rigor, rigor, and so
every time I want a CD,

2182
02:08:35,261 --> 02:08:39,310
I just go there and spend three 99 for
a UCD. Oh, what's the name of the store?

2183
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:42,970
Don't say it because then people will
know exactly what you live. Right now.

2184
02:08:42,971 --> 02:08:45,350
I'm going live right across the street
from it, Brian. I was testing it. Yeah.

2185
02:08:45,940 --> 02:08:48,820
I've been doing me Ba Amoeba
records is pretty dope. Maybe sweet.

2186
02:08:49,050 --> 02:08:52,000
You know it's like some weird whatever
link to the past where you're holding a

2187
02:08:52,001 --> 02:08:54,160
vinyl album. Yeah, no. You're like, whoa,

2188
02:08:54,161 --> 02:08:58,000
this is a disk and you spin this
and something scratches often.

2189
02:08:58,001 --> 02:09:01,600
Do you buy a record and
I'll buy a CD though.

2190
02:09:02,110 --> 02:09:04,780
I'll buy CDs still if I'm someplace,
you know,

2191
02:09:04,810 --> 02:09:07,570
if I'm at best buy and I want to
listen to something, you know,

2192
02:09:07,571 --> 02:09:09,160
like we have a rental car
or something like that,

2193
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:13,560
but now that I have my phone or
my iPod hooked up to my car. Yeah,

2194
02:09:13,570 --> 02:09:17,710
exactly. That's what I'm saying.
All your media in your hand.

2195
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:20,230
What I miss though is a real Dj.

2196
02:09:20,320 --> 02:09:24,110
I Miss Dj's are dual personalities,
right?

2197
02:09:24,540 --> 02:09:27,810
Oh
Hey.

2198
02:09:27,811 --> 02:09:32,610
It's may have in the am
blonde dude.

2199
02:09:33,150 --> 02:09:36,840
96.7 we're getting wacky this morning.

2200
02:09:38,310 --> 02:09:41,280
Drive on the highways.
You can see that mayhem in the am.

2201
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:46,020
I could see that radio show now. You
would have to get a black chick sidekick.

2202
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:50,520
Yeah, she would have to get to the
first one. You're going to fire.

2203
02:09:50,521 --> 02:09:53,640
She's just really, you know, and then
the second one will know, listen bitch,

2204
02:09:53,641 --> 02:09:56,220
you get crazy. We're going to fire
you. Or this is the mayhem show, right?

2205
02:09:56,221 --> 02:09:58,680
Is it then the Tonya show.
Oh Man,

2206
02:09:59,930 --> 02:10:04,490
I read my five Kilkee dear Wendy
Williams talking shit about MMA. Yo,

2207
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:08,850
do you feel fight this weekend? Like
Wendy Williams would be like, no,

2208
02:10:09,390 --> 02:10:13,500
so fun. Oh, whatever. And you're
going to do traffic for me, right?

2209
02:10:13,501 --> 02:10:14,550
And then we got the traffic,

2210
02:10:14,551 --> 02:10:17,670
we got the CD and the one on one I
would have traffic. You would be like,

2211
02:10:17,671 --> 02:10:21,130
kittens would be falling from the
sky and there's videos right away.

2212
02:10:21,131 --> 02:10:22,410
When you were tuned into the clouds,

2213
02:10:22,411 --> 02:10:25,730
it'd be some fucking flaming skull
face and scares the shit out of you.

2214
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:29,490
Had a little bit of blood on my toilet
bowls seat when I got off and today.

2215
02:10:30,690 --> 02:10:33,120
Have you seen that video
of that rat attacking?

2216
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:35,880
Yeah. Wow. Wait.

2217
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:39,350
Brazilian jungle rat or something
or it's some crazy route.

2218
02:10:39,351 --> 02:10:42,620
I don't know where it was,
but this is rat running after these cats.

2219
02:10:42,621 --> 02:10:46,720
And one one time bites this one cat and
it stuck to them and the cats run and

2220
02:10:46,721 --> 02:10:49,220
trying to shake the rat off. This
rat doesn't give a fuck. Yeah.

2221
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:51,020
These cats are so confused.
Well,

2222
02:10:51,021 --> 02:10:55,340
I mean they're domesticated house cats
and not fighting giant mega monster wrath

2223
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:57,440
that have been mutated by ooze.

2224
02:10:57,530 --> 02:11:00,110
And you realize when you see
that how high rats can jump,

2225
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:02,720
they jump up to bite those
mother fuckers jump high.

2226
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:07,010
They're like an athletic animal. They're,
they're pretty loked man. We're lucky.

2227
02:11:07,011 --> 02:11:11,270
Rats are little or big.
We'd be really be fuck man.

2228
02:11:11,271 --> 02:11:14,090
I killed the rat once in my garage and
I left it there because I was lazy.

2229
02:11:14,470 --> 02:11:16,670
So I lived in Encino and uh,

2230
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:19,970
it was a big fucking rat because I used
to leave the garbage back there and I

2231
02:11:19,971 --> 02:11:23,650
would hear like these clean my garage
like clang, clang, clang. Oh here,

2232
02:11:23,660 --> 02:11:26,360
these loud ass noises.
And I opened up my garage,

2233
02:11:26,570 --> 02:11:31,190
I open up the door and I hit the light
switch and this fucking rat moved across

2234
02:11:31,191 --> 02:11:35,300
my garbage and it was like, like attack
size. Like he could attack me. Like,

2235
02:11:35,301 --> 02:11:38,750
this is a big dangerous
threatening animal. I was
looking at this like, holy fuck,

2236
02:11:38,751 --> 02:11:42,860
that's a big rat. That's called a
possum. It was big. It was a rat. It was,

2237
02:11:42,861 --> 02:11:45,550
but it was big man. It was like half
the size of how do you know as a rat?

2238
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:49,040
Because I killed it. So I set up a
trap. Got Them. I've got a rat trap.

2239
02:11:49,041 --> 02:11:52,790
Set it up there and I came back
and he was fucking big man,

2240
02:11:52,791 --> 02:11:56,330
like big and fat. Fucking, I'm like,
this was eating my all my garbage.

2241
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:59,840
I out to put that on net.
If I were you, I fucked up.

2242
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:03,530
This is before he even had Joe
Rogan. Dot. Trap was in his ass.

2243
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:07,640
If I had acted back then I would have
owned Joe rogan.com but I was sleeping

2244
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:12,980
that motherfucker. That to me is one of
the greatest losses as a real estate guy.

2245
02:12:12,981 --> 02:12:17,190
Very nice guy from Boise, Idaho. You
want an a shitload of money for it?

2246
02:12:17,191 --> 02:12:20,780
You want to like 80 grand, some
crazy. I was like, what? I'm like,

2247
02:12:20,781 --> 02:12:23,900
I can't give you that much money, man.
I have not. Dot Net they can find it.

2248
02:12:23,901 --> 02:12:26,180
You know now with Google, if you want
to find my website, you can find it.

2249
02:12:26,181 --> 02:12:27,280
It's not that hard.
You know?

2250
02:12:27,290 --> 02:12:30,980
I can't give you that much for
fucking.com crazy asshole. I know. Yeah,

2251
02:12:31,850 --> 02:12:33,770
you're Joe Rogan.
Gimme some money.

2252
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:36,860
There's another guy that has
an issue with that. Tom Green.

2253
02:12:37,310 --> 02:12:40,130
Why turn off the tongue? Because
there's another dude named Tom Green.

2254
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:42,590
You're on there tomorrow, by the way,
right? Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm doing Tom Green.

2255
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:48,230
I don't know. Good question. Tom Green's
a podcast tomorrow. That's mod castle.

2256
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:51,890
I Guess Kevin Smith has some sort
of a whole podcast on like a,

2257
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:56,830
like a studio set up. Oh yeah. Just to do
podcasts. Podcasts are fucking taken off.

2258
02:12:56,840 --> 02:12:59,990
They are and they are. How about
me? Him and the am a podcast.

2259
02:13:01,190 --> 02:13:03,110
If you want to do it, man,
we can. We could set it up.

2260
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:06,740
We can do it at Brian's place. You can
come to my house. Can't rape him. No Man.

2261
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:09,170
No rape promise. Who? Eric,

2262
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:13,890
you might have to rate me. Chris over
here. He can't tell his character.

2263
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:17,420
His name is fucking Eric Bro.
That's today. He used to be Chris,

2264
02:13:17,700 --> 02:13:21,170
which just for the record, he
changed his name. Brian First,

2265
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:26,090
but then Chris after he met you
and then Eric after today. Yeah.

2266
02:13:26,910 --> 02:13:31,470
I always, I always care of every
name. Yup. Cause so in your red band,

2267
02:13:31,500 --> 02:13:32,100
I can't call

2268
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:35,760
you. I get a nickname or my
head for somebody like Eric.

2269
02:13:35,761 --> 02:13:37,480
I know you don't do red band,
whatever.

2270
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:40,560
You're just trying to
play with my emotions.

2271
02:13:43,940 --> 02:13:48,380
You're like that fucking laugh. This
whole attitude you have towards live this,

2272
02:13:48,381 --> 02:13:51,320
uh, I'm not scared to be around
mountain lions and Charlotte.

2273
02:13:51,490 --> 02:13:55,500
Why would you be man? Whatever,
man. I'm not saying, look,

2274
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:57,420
I'm not saying you're wrong.
I'm not saying you're wrong.

2275
02:13:58,380 --> 02:14:01,530
Everybody's scared to be around. I think
you only think about it more though.

2276
02:14:02,070 --> 02:14:05,910
Yeah. You're constantly
thinking I'm too, too aware.

2277
02:14:06,060 --> 02:14:10,290
I just feel like I'll deal with that when,
when it comes up like, ah, I'm like, Oh,

2278
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:13,420
right now I'm gonna live my life and
then I see a fucking mountain lion.

2279
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:16,650
All right. Why Mountain
biking? Which makes sense.

2280
02:14:16,651 --> 02:14:20,400
Cause they both have mountain in them.
I would fucking deal with it then.

2281
02:14:20,820 --> 02:14:21,653
It's a very good,

2282
02:14:21,680 --> 02:14:25,550
weird thing when you lock eyes with a
big Predator like a mountain lion in the

2283
02:14:25,551 --> 02:14:29,150
wild. You know I only locked
eyes with the one that I saw.

2284
02:14:29,151 --> 02:14:31,940
I only locked eyes with it for
a couple seconds. But that's a,

2285
02:14:31,970 --> 02:14:36,090
that's a very weird moment when you saw
it with your dog from a giant dog boy.

2286
02:14:36,100 --> 02:14:39,950
Yeah. My giant dog was inside my little
dog there was outside. They got jacked.

2287
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:43,340
My giant dog is stolen from
you. Yeah, my no, no, no.

2288
02:14:43,370 --> 02:14:47,300
My task was injured so
he had injured his Paul.

2289
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:48,890
So I left him in the house.
Yeah.

2290
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:51,770
They want them running around up in the
mountains because they would run all

2291
02:14:51,771 --> 02:14:54,410
over the place up there. Just
kidding. You know, they'd get a pack,

2292
02:14:54,411 --> 02:14:56,150
there's three of them together
and they would have a good time.

2293
02:14:56,151 --> 02:14:58,850
Just go run and play.
And that kept animals away.

2294
02:14:59,030 --> 02:15:02,240
But I have a bulldog and he's lazy.
And then this little dog,

2295
02:15:02,241 --> 02:15:06,980
which was a Chihuahua Palm, excuse
me, Pomeranian a American Eskimo mix.

2296
02:15:07,550 --> 02:15:10,100
And that one's the one that got jacked
cause he was out there wandering around

2297
02:15:10,101 --> 02:15:11,000
basically by himself.

2298
02:15:11,001 --> 02:15:14,510
He's only 20 pounds and he doesn't have
his hundred and 40 pound buddy to look

2299
02:15:14,511 --> 02:15:18,000
over his shoulders and he doesn't have
the bull dog cause the bulldogs is,

2300
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:21,230
you know, would go with them if the two
of them were going, even though he's lazy,

2301
02:15:21,231 --> 02:15:23,180
he would go with them.
So it was a lot of action there.

2302
02:15:23,181 --> 02:15:25,190
There was a pack that
keep the animals away,

2303
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:28,970
but something that had been stalking my
house for a while because the dogs would

2304
02:15:29,030 --> 02:15:30,500
just go crazy.
It'd be on the porch,

2305
02:15:30,510 --> 02:15:33,170
just start barking at the top
of their lungs and he, you know,

2306
02:15:33,171 --> 02:15:37,250
you'd hear things like snapping in the,
in the distance and the dark trip.

2307
02:15:37,670 --> 02:15:40,550
Do I have to worry about,
I probably don't, but I'm
pretty, I pretty much have it.

2308
02:15:40,610 --> 02:15:43,700
I'm pretty sure I don't have to.
But as you crows,

2309
02:15:44,510 --> 02:15:49,130
crows don't like kill dogs.
Right? Did you not see the movie?

2310
02:15:49,490 --> 02:15:51,710
Well I'm not talking about for Hitchcock,

2311
02:15:51,980 --> 02:15:55,720
Brandon crozer ruthless cause a root.
That's right.

2312
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:59,870
There's kill your dog like coughing. They
can. There's this guy in this girl crow,

2313
02:15:59,871 --> 02:16:03,740
they just sit out and like make these
clicking noise like like the whole time

2314
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:04,401
and then,

2315
02:16:04,401 --> 02:16:06,860
and then my dog would come up there and
just be like looking up at it and then

2316
02:16:06,861 --> 02:16:10,110
once in a while the crow just swoops down.
Doesn't like attack it or anything.

2317
02:16:10,330 --> 02:16:13,460
It's kind of like he's just like,
like about to, do you need it?

2318
02:16:13,461 --> 02:16:14,930
I left a stake outside.

2319
02:16:15,110 --> 02:16:18,770
It was partially thawed and not totally
thought out and I was going to barbecue

2320
02:16:18,771 --> 02:16:23,300
so I left to stay outside for 10 minutes.
I came back, there was two crows on it,

2321
02:16:23,301 --> 02:16:24,920
just jacking the steak,

2322
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:29,880
just pulling out chunks of
the meat squawking and I
chased him all Christ. Yeah.

2323
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:30,070
Oh

2324
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:30,821
Dude,
fuck yeah.

2325
02:16:30,821 --> 02:16:33,370
You have to worry if you can't like
leave your dog outside if that's what you

2326
02:16:33,371 --> 02:16:37,880
mean. Dude, in Japan they have your dogs
for three pounds and she's a whore pouch.

2327
02:16:37,910 --> 02:16:40,300
The three pounds will come out.
My Dogs fucking the crows.

2328
02:16:40,530 --> 02:16:44,620
The crows are gang bang and your dog, you
get over it. You missed the story. Nixon,

2329
02:16:44,650 --> 02:16:49,060
he brought his dog to a party where a
bunch of people at dogs and they all took

2330
02:16:49,061 --> 02:16:52,690

salmon at the same time. All the dog.

2335
02:17:08,071 --> 02:17:12,380

but like he had this little like,

2336
02:17:13,110 --> 02:17:15,180

just like all over it for banging them

2338
02:17:20,671 --> 02:17:25,010
front. Headlock banging. I'm
like, yeah. I was like, what
are you all right? I'm like,

2339
02:17:25,020 --> 02:17:26,820
wow, you're into dude's, Huh? Stop.

2340
02:17:26,821 --> 02:17:30,000
I guess I figured if I was just run
around with just like a collar on,

2341
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:33,630
I would be, you know, whatever
the line is blurred at that point.

2342
02:17:34,410 --> 02:17:37,270
The line is blurry. Like you're,
you're running around the collar,

2343
02:17:37,340 --> 02:17:39,000
you're a wild animal, you know, whatever.

2344
02:17:39,030 --> 02:17:41,630
If the females in heat then it becomes
very clear. That's what I mean.

2345
02:17:41,640 --> 02:17:44,970
He was sniffing at the Coochie
to like quite a bit. He was like,

2346
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:50,130
my pit bull was um, he was in
agony one night, like in serious,

2347
02:17:50,131 --> 02:17:52,710
serious agony where I thought you
said something wrong with him,

2348
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:54,780
like he's got cancer or something.
This is crazy.

2349
02:17:55,020 --> 02:17:58,140
He was like whining and Yiping and I'd
come near him. I'm like, what's up buddy?

2350
02:17:58,141 --> 02:18:03,000
Okay. And I'm like, Whoa, this
is crazy. My dog's fucked up.

2351
02:18:03,001 --> 02:18:05,640
Like you'd go down the stairs and you'd
be like limping as he was going down the

2352
02:18:05,641 --> 02:18:09,850
stairs come off. I've felt real
sad. I'm like, my dog's kind die.

2353
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,780
Something's wrong with my dog. I got to
get them to the vet. This is horrible.

2354
02:18:12,781 --> 02:18:16,260
He's like whimpering. So I'd take
him to the vet. The vet looks at me,

2355
02:18:16,560 --> 02:18:18,390
he starts checking out my dog's balls.

2356
02:18:18,470 --> 02:18:21,330
You're checking out his dick and he's
like, you see this? He's, yes, right here.

2357
02:18:21,331 --> 02:18:23,060
See how inflamed the says?
Okay,

2358
02:18:23,061 --> 02:18:26,580
there's a dog in your neighborhood that's
in heat and that's what's going on.

2359
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,010
I'm like, Whoa, really?

2360
02:18:29,011 --> 02:18:34,011
He's in agony from his heart
on his dick was so swollen.

2361
02:18:34,830 --> 02:18:37,110
It was so like,
like the glands,

2362
02:18:37,230 --> 02:18:40,650
like here's the balls and then there's
these weird glance by the side of the

2363
02:18:40,651 --> 02:18:45,390
Dick that are just lie dog has that
sometime. What is your dog fixed? No, no.

2364
02:18:45,391 --> 02:18:49,950
My dog isn't either. And they get big.
That's what I said. He shall do anything.

2365
02:18:50,310 --> 02:18:54,170
They can't do anything. You can,
if you want a drink, dogs help.

2366
02:18:54,190 --> 02:18:56,430
But then red rock is how many times
you going to do that in a row?

2367
02:18:57,790 --> 02:19:02,460
If I had to do it every, I dunno, a
couple of weeks. I guess I could. Yeah.

2368
02:19:03,060 --> 02:19:07,230
I mean he's a good friend. My friend,
my friend Dimitris to jerk off his dog.

2369
02:19:08,370 --> 02:19:12,430
I'm going to answer the phone.
It's right there. Same Person.

They're not friends hurt my feeling.

2373

with that ring comes the end.
That is the end of the show.

2376

There's no reason to keep going. No,

crazy hunter s Thompson shit.

2386
02:20:03,001 --> 02:20:06,480
His writing is really good. I mean
it's, it's, it's the latest one of you.

2387
02:20:06,481 --> 02:20:09,490

cause you were there for a couple of

2389
02:20:12,030 --> 02:20:16,200
weeks, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I was out

2391
02:20:21,601 --> 02:20:24,870
man, man, it's scary. Scary. The article.

2392
02:20:24,871 --> 02:20:27,740
It's all kind of read the article and
really give us a little bit into it.

2393
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:29,790
I see the article I'm here right now.
That's like,

2394
02:20:29,791 --> 02:20:31,710
give me a little bit
like a whole new Doug.

2395
02:20:32,700 --> 02:20:34,980
He was like the next
level. I don't know, it's,

2396
02:20:35,130 --> 02:20:40,130
I always had my preconceived notions
about Brazil due to movies and do to,

2397
02:20:42,990 --> 02:20:46,650
you know, whatever the hell is going
on. Right. And you know like my friends,

2398
02:20:46,651 --> 02:20:49,020
my Brazilian friends to fighters,
what they tell me about it.

2399
02:20:49,260 --> 02:20:51,330
I have a new found respect for,

2400
02:20:51,390 --> 02:20:56,370
for that city and I understand my
Brazilian friends a little bit more now.

2401
02:20:57,290 --> 02:20:58,200
The article really,

2402
02:20:58,860 --> 02:21:03,860
I can just see why they
think that everything it like
they have such passion for

2403
02:21:04,291 --> 02:21:09,210
their, for their country because
everybody there has a lot of passion.

2404
02:21:09,330 --> 02:21:12,210
It was like, it's like that
like it's a passionate place.

2405
02:21:12,211 --> 02:21:13,560
Like people love to do stuff.

2406
02:21:13,561 --> 02:21:18,561
Like people are good at things and like
they really love it and it's the stuff

2407
02:21:18,610 --> 02:21:22,470
that's dirty. It's supposed to be dirty,
like it's kind of dirty of course,

2408
02:21:22,471 --> 02:21:26,130
but it's supposed to be dirty.
What do you mean like dirty, dirty,

2409
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:29,880
but in a bad way.
Not that sounds bad,

2410
02:21:29,881 --> 02:21:32,280
but it's like the streets are dirty.

2411
02:21:32,370 --> 02:21:34,950
Everybody drives with like a vengeance,

2412
02:21:35,020 --> 02:21:38,910
like they drive crazy crazy,
but it's like seems skillful.

2413
02:21:38,911 --> 02:21:43,290
I saw less car wrecks there
than I ever saw here in la.

2414
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:46,770
It's all what you get used to, you know,
get used to that sort of hyper driving.

2415
02:21:46,771 --> 02:21:49,950
Like everybody's used to it. It's like,
exactly. Everybody's just drive through.

2416
02:21:50,070 --> 02:21:52,860
I don't know man. There's so much
stuff. Fight magazine, we'll,

gotta check it out, check out the article.

2418
02:21:57,360 --> 02:22:01,050
Did you see anything crazy while you
were there? Any violence? Anything nutty?

2419
02:22:01,170 --> 02:22:05,780
I mean, I saw him, we went to the favelas.
We went to a couple of times too. Like,

2420
02:22:06,030 --> 02:22:09,360
yeah, the ghetto, like, yeah, we
went to the favelas and I, you know,

2421
02:22:09,361 --> 02:22:11,250
I write about that in this article too,
man,

2422
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:16,230
about going there and people are like
collecting rainwater and these drums,

2423
02:22:16,500 --> 02:22:20,110
you know, to to, yeah, it's
a drink. They're poor and,

2424
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:24,250
and they have like their,
uh, tapping into the, uh,

2425
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:27,390
telephone poles get electricity.
Yeah.

2426
02:22:27,391 --> 02:22:31,080
And like the streets are all jagged
and people own that area. You know,

2427
02:22:31,081 --> 02:22:33,630
like the drug dealers own
the favelas and stuff,

2428
02:22:33,631 --> 02:22:35,850
but they have the boppy coming in like,

2429
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:40,080
which are the Brazilian like kick
ass police force to like the,

2430
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:42,120
the police station that,
you know,

2431
02:22:42,121 --> 02:22:45,590
I was right there in the middle of the
thing and everyone's running out like a,

2432
02:22:45,591 --> 02:22:50,340
the, the, you can, it feels like a
military presence instead of like a army.

2433
02:22:50,341 --> 02:22:54,690
The ones that they have,
they taken over and been nice
again. Wow. Yeah. It's crazy.

2434
02:22:54,750 --> 02:22:58,590
Yeah. There's a big article, I think
it was on CNN this morning about that,

2435
02:22:58,600 --> 02:23:01,290
but there's tanks moving back into
that right now. It's like, yeah,

2436
02:23:01,291 --> 02:23:05,010
a little bit of like, uh,
some Aye. Aye. Marcel Alonzo,

2437
02:23:05,011 --> 02:23:09,640
this journalist that I was out
there with a, he kind of a t told,

2438
02:23:09,750 --> 02:23:12,480
you know, he kinda told me
that it's dying down right now,

2439
02:23:12,481 --> 02:23:13,770
but there's like a lot of guys,

2440
02:23:13,890 --> 02:23:17,870
the drug dealers doing crazy terrorist
stuff right now in Rio. It's sucks that,

2441
02:23:17,871 --> 02:23:20,160
that, uh, that that's happening right now.

2442
02:23:21,370 --> 02:23:23,530
I was in Sao Paulo in 2003,

2443
02:23:23,620 --> 02:23:27,580
and a friend of mine went back in 2008,
I believe it was,

2444
02:23:27,581 --> 02:23:30,760
and he was arrested. They were,
uh, there, there was so many,

2445
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:33,940
there was so much violence between the
police and the drug dealers that they

2446
02:23:33,941 --> 02:23:38,020
were closing down streets and highways
and they were driving to a chew Hoss

2447
02:23:38,021 --> 02:23:41,290
Korea with some business clients and
everybody was pulled out of the car at

2448
02:23:41,291 --> 02:23:43,990
gunpoint. They had fucking, you know, they
wanted to make sure that they weren't,

2449
02:23:44,170 --> 02:23:46,390
they were in a nice car and they didn't
know who these people were and they

2450
02:23:46,391 --> 02:23:47,770
wanted to make sure they
weren't drug dealers.

2451
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:50,770
They were just pulling people out and
sticking guns in their faces. Yeah,

2452
02:23:50,771 --> 02:23:51,280
of course.

2453
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:53,980
He said it was pretty fucking scary
because they were killing police officers'

2454
02:23:53,981 --> 02:23:57,970
families. They would go to their family
and just kill everyone. Really? Yeah.

2455
02:23:58,060 --> 02:23:59,470
They were doing it for a while,
man.

2456
02:23:59,471 --> 02:24:02,830
They were declaring war on the
police officers. It was pretty,

2457
02:24:02,831 --> 02:24:07,240
it was pretty lucked out. No Way.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Brazil, you know,

2458
02:24:07,241 --> 02:24:11,590
and the crazy thing about Brazil is,
you know, Brazil's up beautiful, insane,

2459
02:24:11,591 --> 02:24:16,000
like tropical jungle country and
the favelas where all like the,

2460
02:24:16,001 --> 02:24:20,650
the chaos has taken place is above
the regular city. I know. Yeah. Rio,

2461
02:24:20,651 --> 02:24:23,730
which is like the main cities
in the bottom. And then we're,

2462
02:24:23,740 --> 02:24:27,880
the beautiful view is that's all the
projects that we have, the richest,

2463
02:24:28,060 --> 02:24:32,040
most beautiful view, like
in the world, you know,

2464
02:24:32,050 --> 02:24:34,330
and they live living in like
cardboard houses and Shit.

2465
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:38,310
Yeah, no, they put that stuff together on
their own, like crazy. Yeah. But you know,

2466
02:24:38,311 --> 02:24:42,380
I mean, I can, I can understand why people
love the country. You know what I mean?

2467
02:24:42,390 --> 02:24:46,260
Like I can understand why
it has definitely a passion
filled country, man. Yeah,

2468
02:24:46,410 --> 02:24:48,630
that's what I mean. Yeah.
It's great man. I, I dunno,

2469
02:24:48,631 --> 02:24:52,850
I had a great experience out there. Like
I, it was just, it was their economies.

2470
02:24:53,190 --> 02:24:56,010
I mean, right now. Yeah, exactly.
You have so much going on right now.

2471
02:24:56,011 --> 02:25:00,060
And they found, they also found the
oil off the coast of Brazil. So like,

2472
02:25:00,061 --> 02:25:02,190
there's a lot of money
in Brazil right now.

2473
02:25:02,191 --> 02:25:04,300
Their economy's not fucked
up like ours is. It's,

2474
02:25:04,301 --> 02:25:05,760
it's moving in a better direction.

2475
02:25:06,570 --> 02:25:09,840
They're talking about doing a UFC there
eventually. I would be a fascinating,

2476
02:25:10,650 --> 02:25:13,310
but you know, you talked to like, um, uh,

2477
02:25:13,330 --> 02:25:17,490
w Vinnie a Magallanes you have any yeah,
sure.

2478
02:25:17,491 --> 02:25:20,250
He was talking about, uh,
the on the underground,

2479
02:25:20,251 --> 02:25:23,650
he was talking about doing
a UFC in Rio and he posed,

2480
02:25:23,651 --> 02:25:25,900
I think it was him who
posted some link of some, no,

2481
02:25:25,901 --> 02:25:29,510
Sonya was post the link of the Formula
One drivers Formula One drivers where a

2482
02:25:29,530 --> 02:25:33,430
in some Sao Paulo and they got
fucking shot at and their armored car.

2483
02:25:33,580 --> 02:25:36,640
I take try it someone who is trying to
carjack them and they're an armored cars.

2484
02:25:37,150 --> 02:25:41,310
What? Yeah. And you're trying
to kidnap him. Damn. Yeah.

2485
02:25:41,780 --> 02:25:45,700
Kidnapped from or just robbed him rather
than at gunpoint hoping they get some

2486
02:25:45,701 --> 02:25:50,320
watches or something crazy. A buddy
of mine was there. Um, and, uh,

2487
02:25:50,350 --> 02:25:52,620
he, I was with a friend
of his that was, uh,

2488
02:25:52,930 --> 02:25:56,410
doing something and he had like a
pocket full of money and he had in his,

2489
02:25:56,470 --> 02:25:59,800
in his lap and he was like looking
through it and trying to fish through it.

2490
02:25:59,950 --> 02:26:02,680
And as he was doing this,
a guy came up in a motorcycle,

2491
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:06,430
looked at his gun or looked at, uh,
his, uh, his money pulled out a gun,

2492
02:26:06,460 --> 02:26:08,110
tapped on the windshield,
you know,

2493
02:26:08,111 --> 02:26:11,380
told the guy to pull over and they
just robbed him. They robbed everybody,

2494
02:26:12,050 --> 02:26:14,410
stuck a gun in their face
and just took everybody,

2495
02:26:14,411 --> 02:26:17,860
he said the guy would just drive around
looking in people's cars to see if they

2496
02:26:17,861 --> 02:26:20,380
had nice watches or what they have that
look cool and it would just steal it,

2497
02:26:21,130 --> 02:26:24,160
man. Yeah, you might be in the
wrong place. The wrong time,

2498
02:26:24,161 --> 02:26:27,040
son that's made brown the voice of doom,
doom.

2499
02:26:27,050 --> 02:26:30,650
You tell her you're the most
guy on earth right now. Like,

2500
02:26:30,651 --> 02:26:34,640
I'm not like Joe Rogan is scared of
the world. It's not, I'm just aware.

2501
02:26:34,710 --> 02:26:37,400
I'm not scared of you just pay them away.
Don't get jacked.

2502
02:26:37,430 --> 02:26:39,940
But you know as person who's
constantly thinking about shit,

2503
02:26:39,941 --> 02:26:42,250
I always have to be a whale
aware of all the variables.

2504
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:46,480
You know he think way too much bro. You
think so? I think you'd think a lot.

2505
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:49,660
You think Soto,
I think you think deep into some things.

2506
02:26:49,661 --> 02:26:51,610
You don't need to think that deep.
It can help it though.

2507
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,140
It's probably a sickness.

2508
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:57,430
It's a sickness that manifests
itself as a an an excellent career.

2509
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:02,470
You know the sickness of
constantly thinking about
shit and breaking things down

2510
02:27:02,471 --> 02:27:06,790
to the finest minutia OCD though or
something. Something probably like that.

2511
02:27:07,380 --> 02:27:08,213
That's all.
It's not,

2512
02:27:08,930 --> 02:27:12,100
the hard thing with me is just finding
the right things to break down.

2513
02:27:12,101 --> 02:27:16,420
Things that are productive to tune my
my energy too cause you could easily get

2514
02:27:16,421 --> 02:27:20,380
the awesome thing I and that's what
masturbation or online arguments or video

2515
02:27:20,381 --> 02:27:24,370
games or you can get lost in a
bunch of like unhealthy channels.

2516
02:27:24,950 --> 02:27:27,940
Hopefully you got some good stuff
though that you OCD about like butthole

2517
02:27:27,950 --> 02:27:31,810
tidiness and like trimming
and stuff like that. You.

2518
02:27:32,050 --> 02:27:36,490
The show was going to end and it was going
to be fine right there and you had to

2519
02:27:36,491 --> 02:27:39,550
come in. Brian. Now man, he wants
to talk about your butthole.

2520
02:27:39,820 --> 02:27:43,180
He's all about bottles. I told you bro,
1 million, 1 million, 1 million. Okay.

2521
02:27:43,181 --> 02:27:46,060
And no less. And I don't need that million
bucks. I'll tell you that right now.

2522
02:27:46,061 --> 02:27:50,290
I would like it. I like it, but if I don't
get it, I'll be okay. God, goddammit.

2523
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:55,510
Jason, that was a good time. Yeah,
it was always a good time with you.

2524
02:27:55,511 --> 02:28:00,070
And my friend May Have Miller at
Twitter. Um, so, um, okay, cool.

2525
02:28:01,440 --> 02:28:04,760
Um, I've got another coconut
juice for you. Fell off.

2526
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:07,810
Brian's a Twitter is red band.

2527
02:28:07,811 --> 02:28:10,930
We want to thank the fleshlight for
sponsoring the podcast. And again,

2528
02:28:11,350 --> 02:28:14,290
if you would like to feel what it feels
like to masturbate into one of those

2529
02:28:14,530 --> 02:28:18,400
fine sweet bitches I have to do is go to

2531
02:28:22,650 --> 02:28:25,880
Rogan [inaudible] very simple.
Um,

2532
02:28:26,510 --> 02:28:30,320
the tickets for the New Year's eve show
at Mandalay Bay will go up very shortly.

2533
02:28:30,321 --> 02:28:32,960
We should have all that done
within a couple of days. And uh,

2534
02:28:32,990 --> 02:28:35,960
as soon as I get it done,
I'll let you guys know and uh,

2535
02:28:35,961 --> 02:28:38,210
we might be doing one
more podcast this week.

2536
02:28:38,210 --> 02:28:42,650
We're gonna try and get Ralphie
may in here on Wednesday.
Oh, I just, Ralphie May.

2537
02:28:42,651 --> 02:28:45,310
He's awesome. If Ralph he's got the
time off. We've got to talk to them,

2538
02:28:45,311 --> 02:28:50,300
but our right batch, it's hard not fuel.
And um, I'll see you soon somewhere.

2539
02:28:50,660 --> 02:28:53,770
Maybe not even see you,
but I'll be there and you'll be there too.

2540
02:28:53,771 --> 02:28:58,390
And let's pretend we're all in the
same place. What is this ice tea?

2541
02:29:00,210 --> 02:29:03,730
Cause this icy saying suck
my dick is no. Yeah, it is.

2542
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:08,920
Sounds like it. Yeah. This
sounds like a black guy,

2543
02:29:08,921 --> 02:29:13,120
but not too black gay. He's
not like Africa, you know,

2544
02:29:13,121 --> 02:29:17,470
he's not like check Congo black.
I'm saying it gets light skin it,

2545
02:29:18,370 --> 02:29:23,370
he might even rock an afro just to try
to accentuate is more African side.

2546
02:29:24,570 --> 02:29:27,700
Yeah, but he has braids and the summer.
Yeah. Because if he had a shaved head,

2547
02:29:27,701 --> 02:29:31,120
you might think he was an
Arab or something. Right?
Yeah, baby. Yeah. Light it.

2548
02:29:31,240 --> 02:29:35,140
Probably like a yellow, maybe even got
a little bit of like white features,

2549
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:37,960
which is why he's got such an
extra aggressive attitude. Yeah.

2550
02:29:38,020 --> 02:29:42,190
I was trying to like accentuate
prop himself up, but you know,

2551
02:29:42,880 --> 02:29:47,770
you know your race him.
That's not racist,

2552
02:29:47,771 --> 02:29:51,580
Bro. I see. I break it all
down and I hit my look, Bro.

2553
02:29:52,370 --> 02:29:55,180
All right, folks, most likely
we will be back on Wednesday.

2554
02:29:55,210 --> 02:29:58,270
I'm doing the Tom Green thing tomorrow.
I don't have any details.

2555
02:29:58,300 --> 02:30:00,910
That's Tom Green's thing.
You could follow him on Twitter.

2556
02:30:00,911 --> 02:30:03,330
I think it's Tom Green
live. That's it. Pitches.

2557
02:30:03,340 --> 02:30:07,210
I love you and I'll see you next week
or sometime soon or, or Wednesday.
