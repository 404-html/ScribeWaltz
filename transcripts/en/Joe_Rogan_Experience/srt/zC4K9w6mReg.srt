1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,250
Is looking to go to war.
Everybody else was looking to kill them.

2
00:00:03,251 --> 00:00:08,251
Everybody else is looking at take it.
Most people in this world just want to 

3
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:10,450
get by.
They want to be healthy.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,540
They want to have children and have 
those children be happy and want to get 

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,870
through the day.
They want to get through the fucking 

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,551
day.
There are led by people who are 

7
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:20,551
profiting off of the drama.

8
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:23,800
That's the real thing.
This is why this podcast is so important

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,860
and not to be melodramatic is to go back
to the success of this podcast and the 

10
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:34,261
success of vice and all this stuff is 
that it's because all of the other shit 

11
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:38,521
out there is bullshit.
This is the whole thing is what happens 

12
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:42,810
in mainstream media and the news cycle 
is crap and what's happening here and 

13
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:46,750
the reason why you have so many people 
listening to you and supporting you.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,200
And the reason why vice is growing so 
rapidly is because we're just regular 

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,590
dudes were regular guys just like,
you know,

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,350
we like,
we like mma fighting me,

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,650
like having a few drinks with you and 
yeah.

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,530
And you go out there in the world and 
you say,

19
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:02,590
hold on a second,
where's the fucking rationality?

20
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:07,591
Yeah,
why did these fuckers have nuclear 

21
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:07,591
weapons?

22
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:09,940
Why the fuck is this happening?
Why is the fucking world sinking?

23
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,210
And we're not doing something about it.
I don't understand.

24
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,510
I'm not like,
I'm not a Jesus on the cross.

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,070
I'm not,
I'm not trying to be that guy.

26
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,810
I'm just going out in the world and 
going,

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,900
holy fuck someone.
I say it's the end of the world is 

28
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:28,870
because I went to cashmere,
I went to the Indian side of cashmere.

29
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,170
The Indians said if we have another 
Mumbai attack,

30
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:34,380
we will attack Pakistan.
Then I went to Pakistan.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,040
I was like,
why are you still sending these?

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,060
You're training the ISI in the military.
Why are you still sending these guys in 

33
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,130
India?
They've said that if you still,

34
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:47,131
if you send them in again,
they're going to attack you and they're 

35
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:47,131
like,
yes,

36
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:48,300
because we're going to win and you're 
like,

37
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,900
nobody's going to fucking win.

38
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,300
You're going to new kitchen,
you're all going to die.

39
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,370
And the thing is,
as I keep saying there,

40
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:55,990
and it's the same thing in China,
it's the same thing.

41
00:01:55,991 --> 00:02:00,991
Even the funny shit that we do is like,
it's the absurdity of the modern 

42
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:05,311
condition that's the world has become 
insane and I'm saying where all the 

43
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:06,730
adults say,
but where's the rationality?

44
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:10,000
Where's just two regular guys?
And by the way,

45
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:11,560
we're just sitting here in a,
in a,

46
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:12,300
in a,
in a,

47
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,340
in with a beautiful oak table,
having a few drinks and so many people 

48
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:22,010
are resonating with it.
So we're just two dudes talking.

49
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:24,070
Yeah,
but the thing is there's so many people,

50
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:24,670
you know,
resonate,

51
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:25,300
resonate,
resonate.

52
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:30,301
Why?
Because everyone just coming out of the 

53
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:30,301
pond going.
Hold on a second,

54
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:32,230
hold on a second.
What the fuck's going on?

55
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,360
What?
We're all rational people.

56
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:36,190
We're all smart people.
We all have the Internet.

57
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:36,880
We use fucking.
See,

58
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:38,890
all this shit's going on,
what the fuck's going on?

59
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,450
And I think that the answers are 
terrifying because you know what?

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,210
Nobody has an answer.
Oh well it's just this,

61
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:46,660
this,
this,

62
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:51,661
and this.
It's not really going to happen because 

63
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:51,661
it's that and it's just this guy doing 
that.

64
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:55,250
Brian Cowen for Fox News.
But the thing is,

65
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:57,300
is it's not true.
Like the regional thing,

66
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,050
the New York Times

67
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,540
says,
D,

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,660
refuted that.
Uh,

69
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,220
yeah,
but it's not true.

70
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,240
Like there is no rationality.
The answer is more terrifying than the 

71
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,270
question is why aren't they fucking.
Why do they have nukes?

72
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,540
Because we gave them because we're crazy
because we're crazy because we so rushed

73
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,380
now had money.
They needed to nukes.

74
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,020
We hadn't needed money.
Boom.

75
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,260
Chucka boom.
Chucka boom.

76
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,730
Correct.
You know what to stay scary real.

77
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,690
The real scary story is Canada had this 
thing that can do reactor,

78
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:28,691
the failsafe react to the most safe 
reactor on her fucking beautiful 

79
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:31,661
reactor.
The titanic and reactors and Canada is 

80
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:31,661
like,
oh,

81
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:32,390
we're the largest donator of 48.
I'm Canadian by the way,

82
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,940
and we're the largest foreign foreign 
donate as a foreign aid and then we gave

83
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:41,330
the reactors to Pakistan and we said,
now whatever you do,

84
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,570
don't do anything bad with it.
And they said,

85
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:45,260
oh,
of course not.

86
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,870
And you're sitting there going,
what the fuck?

87
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,420
What the fuck were you fucking thinking?
Canada giving them fucking reactors.

88
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,840
What the fuck were you thinking?
That's so silly.

89
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,320
The reactive thing is a real freak out 
to me and I talk about my act like I 

90
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,860
don't know if I'm allowed to swear.
By the way,

91
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,160
what are you talking about here?
What's the matter?

92
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,120
Oh,
you want a cigarette?

93
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,170
Will say that shit.
I didn't know.

94
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:18,171
I didn't know what you were saying.
I didn't know that was a bad thing that 

95
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:19,140
somebody would not want you to indulge.
Let's be real here.

96
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,090
I don't know.
Come.

97
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,900
Come on.
Shane Smith.

98
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,340
You know I love you like a brother 
telling me what's going on.

99
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,650
Who doesn't want you to indulge?
You got an issue,

100
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,740
Mrs.
Mrs Shane Smith is perhaps doesn't want 

101
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,260
hubby had cancer or bullets is 
cigarettes,

102
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:32,720
is the last thing she should worry 
about.

103
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,650
These dudes go to the Congo and his 
underwear.

104
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,520
He shocked with the Congo.
You should worry.

105
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,240
Have you gone?
Did you go to the Kinda?

106
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:40,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

107
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:41,940
See,
that's where I dropped it.

108
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,920
I've been to Goma and it's a right now.
It's,

109
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,020
it's,
it's going fucking crazy.

110
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,200
The only way I would go to the Congo,
it was if someone absolutely showed me,

111
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,360
we're going to find the apes.
I could see one of those eight giant.

112
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,370
We're,
we're still working,

113
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,430
bro.
It's something you don't have.

114
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,600
That's not like a sasquatch.

115
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,790
Did I ever tell you about the David?
Show him the dinosaurs.

116
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,240
Yes.
I watched that episode.

117
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,270
He went.
They believe there's a Brontosaurus in 

118
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:12,270
the Congo.
He lit.

119
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,310
There's alligators.
Yeah.

120
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,420
Okay.
We need to wrap our heads around the 

121
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,641
idea that alligator is fucking survive.
You know,

122
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,040
I'm reading this Chris Ryan book sex at 
dawn.

123
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,020
Fascinating,
fascinating book.

124
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,790
And he talks about the name you Katon 
with the name came from.

125
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,430
Is the one of the,
uh,

126
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:36,520
American or one of the Christopher 
Columbus settlers.

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,090
You don't have to worry about where you 
grew up in comedy clubs and pool halls.

128
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,320
Let that shit go.
Don't worry about it.

129
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,270
He,
uh,

130
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,680
he asked them what is the name of your 
land?

131
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,330
And the guy said something like,
well,

132
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,550
you know,
in,

133
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,120
you know,
whatever the Mayan tongue is.

134
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,670
And so they said Yucatan.
Okay.

135
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,420
You could tie that was like as close to 
it.

136
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,140
Turns out one reviewed

137
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,140
what the actual original word was 
because I guess they wrote it down 

138
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,140
somewhere.
It means in mine.

139
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,190
I don't understand you.
So when people go down to Cancun and 

140
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:10,050
they go get their freak on from spring 
break,

141
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:15,070
they're there in the,
I don't understand you peninsula for 

142
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,010
Ryan.
That's when they went to India.

143
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,280
Then said what?
Where are we in there?

144
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:18,780
Like Mumbai.
Bombay.

145
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,820
Perfect,
perfect.

146
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,880
Love it.
Where are you?

147
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,490
Beijing.
Peking.

148
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,220
Love it.
Well,

149
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:26,310
like Greece,
they don't call themselves grease,

150
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:27,780
right?
Don't they have another name?

151
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,560
Yeah,
Hollis.

152
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,510
There's a couple different countries 
like that.

153
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:35,511
Japan is Nepal.
That's another place where we just shot 

154
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:35,511
grease whole

155
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,550
Lee.
Fuck yeah.

156
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,340
Greece is completely insolvent.
Is that the case?

157
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,380
Well it is.
And,

158
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,020
and you know,
so we just shot the riots in Greece,

159
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,210
France,
Spain,

160
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Italy,
and actually the rise of the neo Nazis 

161
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:52,720
in Germany.

162
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,350
Oh Jesus.
But they're back.

163
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,600
They're back.
Don't call it a comeback.

164
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,260
There's chicken fucking Nazis again in 
Germany.

165
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,430
Really?
Germans.

166
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,200
Really?
Folks,

167
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,790
come on,
you got the Internet,

168
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,730
you've got four g and mother fuckers 
actually.

169
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,670
What's,
what?

170
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,890
Faster Internet than us.
Do they bribe the nos?

171
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,320
Yeah,
no,

172
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:12,890
no.
This year.

173
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,180
Oh,
we online at all a wipe.

174
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,320
I found out that you probably have dsl 
and which is like the worst internet in 

175
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,900
the world.
Right?

176
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,990
And uh,
so I put it down to like mobile 

177
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,700
bandwidth style.
So like it's such a low a right myself.

178
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,390
But is it working?
Barely.

179
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,400
You're a technological genius.
Well,

180
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:33,470
he's a bad motherfucker and without him 
I'd be lost.

181
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,550
And he has,
he has,

182
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,680
he has a great tee shirts and I won't 
want to.

183
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,920
Is a great taste in women.
It's bad motherfucker that Brian Redman.

184
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,720
Um,
yeah.

185
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,150
So do you mean look man,
I love you,

186
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,800
but every time we get together we start 
talking to them and gloom.

187
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,470
I fucking Shit my pants and I want to 
believe that there is a way out of this.

188
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:58,880
I want to believe I know is human.
There is,

189
00:07:58,881 --> 00:07:59,930
and I've got to say this,

190
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,110
I've got to say this because it's up to 
guys like you guys like me and guys like

191
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,150
everyone listening to this podcast

192
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,970
to say we have the power to.
That's a lot of responsibility.

193
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,370
We have to get high and watch the 
hobbit.

194
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,860
However you want to get high.

195
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,830
The hobbit.
However,

196
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,640
I'm going to say this publicly and 
online.

197
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,310
I'm Joe Rogan,
who's a famous dude who does UFC and TV 

198
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,140
shows and comics,
comic genius and all the stuff.

199
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,540
He does a podcast,
you know,

200
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,600
pays for a fucking studio,
pays for oak tables,

201
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:40,601
pays for state of the art equipment and 
all this stuff to do a podcast to tell 

202
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:41,660
the fucking truth.
And by the way,

203
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:43,400
that's fucking admirable.
And by the way,

204
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:48,401
everybody out there who has a camera who
has an iphone who has a fucking youtube 

205
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:53,051
connection,
everyone can do it and everyone should 

206
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:53,450
do it because it's time to start fucking
changing shit because you know what shit

207
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:54,050
is fucked up.

208
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,870
They are doing.
And that's the beautiful.

209
00:08:55,871 --> 00:09:00,871
That's beautiful.
There's a bunch of people that we've 

210
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:04,080
introduced via this podcast,
like Danieli Bolelli and the guys from 

211
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:07,520
London real who came down to cast and 
they,

212
00:09:07,521 --> 00:09:12,521
they,
those guys are really popular now 

213
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:12,521
though.
Their podcasts are popular and it's,

214
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:16,690
it's instead of you going through this 
traditional system of not being about 

215
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,180
the value of your contribution,
but rather being about like who's hot 

216
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,031
and who's not,
who's it and who's fucking date and who 

217
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:28,210
and all the nonsense that we get roped 
up in as primates,

218
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:31,600
as social primates,
and to instead say the fuck them.

219
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,610
But I would like to say to everyone 
who's listening to this Joe Rogan Red 

220
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,420
van over there,
just fucking the technological genius.

221
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,620
You guys are doing something that is 
purely democratic,

222
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,950
that is incredibly fucking important,
incredibly useful.

223
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:48,050
It's the reason why every time I come to
La to do this,

224
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,470
because you guys are giving guys like me
and everybody else a fucking platform to

225
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:55,070
say,
hey,

226
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,400
by the way,
I don't want to be all doom and gloom 

227
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:00,400
what I want to say,
but hold on.

228
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,300
What I want to do is say this shit is 
happening.

229
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,660
It's real and people should know about 
it and we can do shit about it,

230
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,980
and by the way,
it's not just us.

231
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,620
Here in America.
People in India can do shit about it.

232
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:11,600
People in Pakistan can do shit about it 
and by the way,

233
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:14,810
youth are fucking pissed off.
They're upset.

234
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,390
The politicians have failed them.
The rich are getting richer,

235
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:21,290
the poor getting poorer and what we're 
trying to do is bring back journalism in

236
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:26,291
the sense that journalism is saying this
shit is fucked up and we collectively 

237
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,520
have to solve it.
Otherwise you have kids.

238
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:30,260
I have kids,
our kids are gonna be fucked.

239
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,740
Yeah.
I run through these various scenarios in

240
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:40,931
my head about the future of humanity and
the only thing that gives me hope is the

241
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,130
access to ideas and information that are
available today.

242
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,580
Just for me,
what I know about me with a phone,

243
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,850
I can pretty much answer almost any 
question I have about anything in the 

244
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:58,820
world and within a couple of hours of 
sitting there and reading shit,

245
00:10:58,821 --> 00:10:59,760
all you need is a goddamn.

246
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,930
You're a guy that doesn't have to do 
this.

247
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:07,140
You don't have to take your time out.
You don't have to pay all this money to 

248
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,140
set this up.
How much money?

249
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,140
Well,
okay.

250
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,290
It's fairly reasonable and it's hard and
it's money and it's time of your day and

251
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:16,291
you're setting up this shit by the way.
More people should be doing it and more 

252
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:17,890
people should be doing shit because

253
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,310
thinking about it that way.
I mean,

254
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,380
the way I think about it is,
first of all,

255
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,390
we were doing it at my house and then we
were doing it.

256
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,680
Brian's place that he set up,
that's quite studios in the ice house.

257
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,840
And uh,
I found out about it,

258
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:31,940
I was like,
why am I doing my shit in my house?

259
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,680
Like,
let's,

260
00:11:32,681 --> 00:11:34,430
let's take this to the next level.
It's.

261
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,670
So I was inspired by like Brian Putting 
together this crazy studio that's using 

262
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,260
it for,
you know,

263
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,320
how long have been there,
Brian?

264
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,740
Yeah,
it was a year anniversary month.

265
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,810
Bob Fisher.
You beautiful motherfucker.

266
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,160
You the guy who owns that place is just 
such a sweetie.

267
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,120
They're all sweeties.
They're the wages are sweeties,

268
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,260
but everybody's nice.
But look at what you built

269
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:59,260
out of it.
Now I've got to say everybody out there 

270
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,390
should take this as an example because 
everybody can do shit.

271
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,380
Yeah.
And by the way,

272
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:01,640
you're doing shit.
You don't have to do shit.

273
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:02,600
You're doing shit.
See,

274
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:07,601
that's where it gets.
That's where I want to sort of 

275
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,350
straightened.
I don't think that I.

276
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:10,190
it's not like I don't have to.
There's no,

277
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:15,191
there's no motivation to do this other 
than joy other than fun other than the 

278
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:17,810
fact that I have.
I love talking to guys like you.

279
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,020
Like how,
how else would I organize a three hour 

280
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,020
conversation with you?
And I,

281
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,850
the only way to make it enticing is I 
have to fucking broadcast online to get 

282
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,960
to meet someone like you.
Like tomorrow we're doing that.

283
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:31,820
Uh,
John McAfee,

284
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,910
the guy,
the virus guy who is,

285
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,950
you know,
in believes on the run.

286
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,400
We're doing that guy.
I couldn't get to talk to that guy in 

287
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,400
real life.
Why would he talk to me?

288
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,710
But you tell more truth here,
right?

289
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,460
Your podcasts,
then Msnbc and Fox put together.

290
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:49,250
And I've got to say that's the future of
journalism,

291
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:49,800
that it's,
it's,

292
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,170
it's,
it's people,

293
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:56,171
regular people like you and me who 
actually give a shit and who have 

294
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:57,330
actually learned stuff.
And because you go around the world

295
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,370
and UC Shit,
I go around the world and should we see 

296
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:02,370
this stuff?
And we go,

297
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,640
hey,
this is ridiculous.

298
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:05,740
Yeah,
change is incredibly difficult,

299
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,170
incredibly difficult for people to 
change.

300
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,850
It's incredibly difficult for systems of
government or systems monitoring systems

301
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:17,851
to change.
Change is incredibly hard and resisted 

302
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:21,061
tooth and claw and the people that are 
involved in Msnbc and CNN and all these 

303
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:27,301
people that perpetrate all this nonsense
journals and I don't fault them,

304
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't because as a guy who's been,
well,

305
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,440
this is my position as a guy who's been 
in the system of television before.

306
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,650
I've been on two different TV shows that
was on a sitcom for five years,

307
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,360
and then I was on fear factor for six 
years.

308
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,840
I kind of see.
I've got a pretty good view of the whole

309
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:47,230
system of creating things in the 
network.

310
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:52,650
It's insurmountable.
It either has to collapse or be absorbed

311
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:55,660
by the Internet.
Those are the only options,

312
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,630
but it as it stands,
is bureaucratic.

313
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:01,330
There's too many people involved,
too much decision making.

314
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,640
It's not,
it's too different.

315
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,980
It's too expensive and difficult to put 
together a fucking Sitcom.

316
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,030
If

317
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,130
you look at your audience and you look 
at what you're doing and,

318
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,270
and other people like you are doing,
you have millions and millions of 

319
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:16,550
followers.
And I would say this,

320
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,570
I would say,
look,

321
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,330
you have as many.
And by the way,

322
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:21,610
more,
um,

323
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,430
you have an audience that's actually 
willing to do shit and willing to 

324
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,430
participate and then they,
you know,

325
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,511
they tweet and the,
and the facebook and then get on the 

326
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:32,150
socials.
And I would say this is like,

327
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:35,240
if you look at Fox,
which is an aging at 67,

328
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:40,241
68,
those people are dying and you're going 

329
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:40,241
to die out.
This is the future.

330
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:44,720
And what you're doing is you're saying,
I'm going to put my flag in the sand and

331
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:45,800
I'm going to say,
you know what?

332
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,470
I'm going to have you been in TV.
You've been successful.

333
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,090
You're still on TV,
you're still successful.

334
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:50,630
You're killing it.

335
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,410
And,
but yet still,

336
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,810
you'll take your time out of your day to
come here and say,

337
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,240
we're going to try.
We're going to do some funny stuff.

338
00:14:57,241 --> 00:14:58,860
We're gonna do some regular stuff.
We're gonna do this and that.

339
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,370
But we're going to try to fucking at 
least say,

340
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,350
hey,
this is what's going on with mcafee.

341
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:06,260
This is what's going on in Pakistan.
This is going on.

342
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,680
Whenever you have me on,
you have other people on.

343
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,420
And I got to say,
look,

344
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,450
that is the future of journalism because
that is the only way today that we're 

345
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:15,690
going to get to the truth.

346
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,580
And I,
look,

347
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,770
I,
I agree with everything you just said.

348
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,670
And the reason why do it is because 
people like you are out there.

349
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,880
The reason why I'm so committed to doing
a podcast like this and the reason why 

350
00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:33,070
Brian and are committed to keeping them 
free is we,

351
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,080
we,
we benefit from it just as much as 

352
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,361
everyone else does.
We benefit from it from our own 

353
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:41,361
conversations.
I mean,

354
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:42,900
Brian and I were just talking about 
simulation theory today,

355
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,690
you know,
it's,

356
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,760
and it's because it's brought up by so 
many brilliant people in the podcast 

357
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:48,760
that,
you know,

358
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,990
we,
we've had these like freaky discussions 

359
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:52,990
about it.
It's a,

360
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,660
this podcast has been an incredible 
fucking thing.

361
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,790
Like I can't ever take.
Not only can I,

362
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,930
I don't feel like I can take any 
responsibility for it.

363
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,460
I can't take any accolades for it 
because all it is,

364
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:04,430
is,
is,

365
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,160
it's,
it's really,

366
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,390
um,
just,

367
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,950
uh,
I feel like completely like a conduit.

368
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,480
And I feel like if I can tune into guys 
like you or had less trout on last year,

369
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,010
last week,
survivor man,

370
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,980
you know,
and I've had Alex Grey,

371
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:22,070
the brilliant visionary artists.
If I can get a forum where these people 

372
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:27,321
can talk through the Internet and reach 
all these other people like I who else 

373
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:29,890
has that opportunity.
And also you had it,

374
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,500
you would do it if anybody else had 
that.

375
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:36,501
They would do it.
If you're thinking in your right mind 

376
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:37,080
and you had a million people that were 
paying attention or whatever the fuck it

377
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:41,580
is now and you knew some shit,
you'd want to tell people some shit.

378
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,000
But I'm allowed to say it's admirable.
And listen,

379
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:50,001
that's not nearly as admirable.
We're chilling here in the fucking 

380
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:53,091
valley.
Brian and I are in the air condition 

381
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:53,820
studio.
You're out there and Mumbai to out there

382
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,850
and I'd like to say is life is good,
right?

383
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,420
In our life has been good and we got to 
kind of get out of jail free card.

384
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:03,810
When I got out of college,
I used to say I'm never going to live in

385
00:17:03,811 --> 00:17:07,830
a house as nice as my parents or,
or drive a car is nice to my parents and

386
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,640
gen x generation sort of got to get out 
of jail free card,

387
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:15,120
but Gen y is going to have to pay the 
bill and you know,

388
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:15,590
and,
and,

389
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,800
and,
and so saying,

390
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:20,460
I think it's our responsibility to say 
we know the fucking problems.

391
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:25,461
We know what's going on.
We know that this is a fucking problem 

392
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,190
and we have to go out there and say,
look,

393
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:27,990
this is a problem.
I don't know the solutions.

394
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:29,400
Again,
I'm not Jesus on the cross,

395
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,490
but at least people.
And this is why.

396
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:37,500
This is what gives me hope is that 
people fundamentally I believe are good.

397
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,800
And I also believe people are 
fundamentally smart and people 

398
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:42,810
fundamentally want to do the right 
thing.

399
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Well,
I think people fundamentally want to be 

400
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:47,880
good because love fields better than 
hate.

401
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,530
Like if I have a little tiny dispute

402
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,880
in my life,
I don't know about you,

403
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:56,881
but the way I feel about,
especially if like amongst my circle of 

404
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:58,120
friends or amongst people I do business 
with or work with,

405
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,960
if there's any sort of a tiny dispute,
there's a ripple in my force and I don't

406
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:06,961
like it.
I don't like that feeling and I want to 

407
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,050
resolve it is lovingly and as kindly and
as apologetically as I can.

408
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:13,051
I always feel like that and some people 
never get to a position where they 

409
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:18,091
really feel at peace with their place in
the world and how they interact with 

410
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:18,610
other people.
They can't.

411
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,820
Whether it's because they're too in debt
or they're in a fucking terrible 

412
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,520
neighborhood or they grew up with a 
crazy mother.

413
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,550
Whatever it is.
You took a bad career path,

414
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:32,551
stuck in a fucking abusive job position.
Whatever the fuck it is that locks you 

415
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:33,550
into your reality,
your existence.

416
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,960
It's very difficult for people that are 
in a torturous position to look at 

417
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:45,751
possibilities and options and to look at
the possibility and options that this 

418
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,460
might not be the correct way to live 
life and that in reality,

419
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:53,461
my narrow minded view has sent me on 
this insurmountable path of ultimate 

420
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:58,951
failure and there's no way to accumulate
enough shit in this life if you're a 

421
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:00,100
temporary being,
there is no way.

422
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,590
So if that is a focus of your existence 
to accumulate,

423
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,700
that doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy 
some shit.

424
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,240
Doesn't mean you shouldn't like get a 
fucking Samsung Galaxy s three and go 

425
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,420
Ooh,
because all that shit's bad ass too.

426
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,480
The,
the,

427
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:17,481
the,
the reality of like something like when 

428
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:17,481
you,
when you hear people talk about,

429
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:22,530
I was having a conversation with someone
and they started talking about the law 

430
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:22,530
of attraction.
Oh,

431
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:22,960
it's the law of attraction.
You bring it into your life.

432
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:23,990
It's the law of attraction,
like

433
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,620
maybe,
but maybe babies die and drive bys too.

434
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,650
Like what's real?
What's realistic is let's look at this 

435
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,230
whole thing,
the reality that we exist in.

436
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Let's look at this whole thing.
It'd be honest about it and say we woke 

437
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:42,870
up in the middle of a dream,
the,

438
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,310
the,
the American,

439
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:49,311
the whoever the fuck you are with the 
Japanese man who 50 years old who wakes 

440
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:52,470
up and his alarm clock goes off today 
and looked at this world.

441
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,010
This world woke up in motion,
and the people,

442
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,540
there's too many of them.
First of all,

443
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,540
there's too many of them to ever 
communicate that no one can.

444
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,370
No one understands what I fucking 
anybody saying.

445
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:07,510
There's too many different languages.
There's no universal acknowledgement of 

446
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,721
our plight and we are headed to doom.
Ultimately.

447
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:16,761
There's no way if we continue along a 
certain path that it doesn't completely 

448
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:21,861
exploded in our face,
whether it's overpopulation or whether 

449
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:24,951
it's pollution or nuclear disaster.
There's a certain amount of stops along 

450
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:28,050
the way until the whole thing ends.
Well,

451
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:31,640
I think I agree with you and I think 
that our generation,

452
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,240
yours and mine has come out of the pond 
and we've had a good life and I love.

453
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,900
I love this country because I came down 
here and build your country better.

454
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,510
I know I do.
My Shit hits the fan.

455
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:46,170
I'm moving to Canada for fucking sure.
I don't even care if it's Montreal.

456
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:47,710
I'll deal with that snow.
I'll take it.

457
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,020
Toronto.
I'll get a snowblower in the warm coat,

458
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,780
but the thing is is you sit there and 
you say,

459
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,780
we came out of the pond.
We realized that shit is happening.

460
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,370
Yes,
we want to live a good life.

461
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,880
I want shit to get better.
Precisely because I've had such a good 

462
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,370
life and I'm not a doom and gloom guy.
I'm a party guy liked to drink.

463
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,140
I like to travel.
I like to eat.

464
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:13,170
I like to do stuff.
I like to learn or to go to all these 

465
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:13,300
different places.
The reason why I'm like,

466
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,260
Hey,
hold on.

467
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,400
These guys want to nuke each other or 
hold on the world to sinking or hey,

468
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:19,870
hold on.
This shit's happening.

469
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:24,871
This is going to fuck everybody up is 
because I like my life is because I like

470
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:28,930
guys like us because I like where we've 
gotten to date.

471
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,380
The problem with it is is that you sit 
there and you say,

472
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:37,381
okay,
I don't want the next generation to not 

473
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:38,320
have that,
to not be able to go outside,

474
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:41,230
swimming the river,
go fishing and do all that stuff and and

475
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:41,890
bright.

476
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,280
Now we're at,
we're at literally just sort of breaking

477
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:47,180
point.
We're at that inflection point of,

478
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,070
of we are,
we can fix it,

479
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,570
we can solve it.
We're smart,

480
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:53,980
we're good.
People want to do it,

481
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,700
and if you follow this,
I'm sure you do.

482
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,890
The people who follow you and,
and,

483
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:04,891
and,
and if you look at what they say on 

484
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:04,891
twitter and you look at what they say on
facebook,

485
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:07,660
people are fucking angry and they're 
down and they're happy.

486
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,490
He want to do something.
They're not ready.

487
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:11,140
They're not represented.
And the thing is,

488
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:13,420
is what's happening,
especially globally,

489
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,480
let alone in this country,
but what's happening globally is that 

490
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,711
the people with the power or 
disenfranchised because the systems that

491
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:28,021
are in place are set up as such,
that they can't be represented.

492
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:32,620
So what this is,
is this is true grassroots democracy.

493
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,740
And by the way,
I hope to God it continues and gets 

494
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,590
bigger and bigger,
and I was making a joke earlier,

495
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,690
this is the first podcast from here,
and I'm like,

496
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,930
I'm going to look back 20 years from now
and say this was the first podcast that 

497
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,980
changed the world because this is the 
root of journalism,

498
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:49,090
which is the root of democracy.

499
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:54,610
Well,
I think that the people that are in the 

500
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,730
position of power that are doing these 
horrible things,

501
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,260
we really need to figure out how to heal
those motherfuckers.

502
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,080
I think we have to figure out how to get
them the fuck out.

503
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,660
You got to get them the fuck out,
but you also get them the fuck out.

504
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:09,780
We got to discourage that type of 
behavior in the future.

505
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,080
I mean,
if you want to be a real hippie and a 

506
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,940
total idealist,
you would say that there's gotta be a 

507
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,271
way that almost everybody can change and
that these people that are in this 

508
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:26,630
position,
these positions of power that are 

509
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,060
looking at things like war and economic 
attacks on countries embargoes or all 

510
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:36,330
these different various things that 
people do that really can cause 

511
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,530
unbelievable irreparable harm to 
communities and families and like,

512
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,640
wow,
we need to figure out a way to get those

513
00:23:41,641 --> 00:23:43,860
people to look at things differently and
say,

514
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,130
your motivation is off.
Your motivation is based on many shitty 

515
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,860
primate shit.
It's based on some ancient primate shit 

516
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,400
while you were running away from Jaguars
and you had to be the most vicious 

517
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,290
motherfucker to survive and that stuff 
manifests itself today.

518
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,440
Millions of years later in the male 
dominance mentality and that mentality 

519
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,530
is not best suited for attacks against 
your fellow man and it can be conquered.

520
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,210
It can be conquered.
It can be understood.

521
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,920
It can be understood in your mindset.
You will be happier person if you do not

522
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:19,610
behave in that manner and you won't be 
any happier if you get more money.

523
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,650
There's a certain amount of money where 
it doesn't matter.

524
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,410
Well,
I have.

525
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,690
I've got to say also that if you look at
it and say I want real people.

526
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:30,440
I want people like me who have had a 
drink too many,

527
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:32,170
who've done a few drugs who've done 
that,

528
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,490
who've had a real life.
If you have,

529
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,050
you know,
guys like,

530
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,660
you know Romney who's like squeaky clean
and whatever.

531
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:42,020
I'm like,
I don't want a robot representing me.

532
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,400
Yes,
because I'm not a robot.

533
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,590
I'm flawed and fucked up and I've been 
through crazy.

534
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,990
Well see,
but the whole thing is,

535
00:24:48,991 --> 00:24:51,120
is I want someone who's human.
Well,

536
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,150
he's,
I want someone who's been through shit 

537
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,660
and who spoke fucking dope when he was 
fucking nine years old and someone who's

538
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,680
emerged.
I want someone who knows what the fuck 

539
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:02,680
is going on.

540
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,710
Romney could be saved with mushrooms,
mushrooms,

541
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,740
and tie hookers and just get Romney on a
fucking island and just give him some 

542
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:13,590
mushrooms and let them understand that 
this is,

543
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:15,360
this is a fucking dream,
man.

544
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:20,361
This is one frame and an infinite movie 
that goes on forever and the only 

545
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:22,560
control that you have whatsoever is to 
enjoy it,

546
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,240
to increase harmony,

547
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,720
to spread the love to use as you were 
talking about,

548
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,900
you know,
talking to she emails or talking to 

549
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,180
Taliban or talking to this or that.
The thing is is if you just talk to 

550
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,060
these motherfuckers,
everybody has a point.

551
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:41,690
Everyone has a point of view.
Everyone has appointed and if you 

552
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:41,690
actually say,
look,

553
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,420
you know,
by the way,

554
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:43,830
for example,
when I was in Pakistan,

555
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:49,550
they were like,
we are Super Mad that you let the 

556
00:25:50,761 --> 00:25:54,480
innocence of Muslims come out like 
America,

557
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,520
you know,
sponsored that,

558
00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:00,530
whatever.
And you're like that video you're 

559
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,571
talking about and you said you 
understand that there's millions upon 

560
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:09,110
millions of videos uploaded every day,
every fucking day on Youtube.

561
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,820
There's no government regulation.
There's no,

562
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,400
you know,
Obama's not sitting there going,

563
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:19,401
ha ha,
we really got them now and they could 

564
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:19,401
not believe that they were just like,
no,

565
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:21,390
you guys have done this thing and that's
why we're shooting.

566
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,990
There were people killed and there's 
been no violence because of this.

567
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:26,980
And now there's a whole,
uh,

568
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
you know,
because a lot of the people that are 

569
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,000
literate that your mom say,
well,

570
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,940
America is doing this and this is part 
of their policy whenever,

571
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,180
and you're like,
this was just a bunch of fruitcakes who 

572
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,670
did the fucking thing and all of a 
sudden now people are dying and there's,

573
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,180
you know,
home militias being mobilized because of

574
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:43,920
this and that point.
You're like,

575
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,030
if people just actually fucking,
which I do,

576
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:48,570
I say,
look,

577
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,450
I'm going to tell you I lived there.
I do this.

578
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:53,490
I have two of the most popular channels 
on Youtube.

579
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,520
People just upload shit.
It just fucking happens.

580
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,640
It's not like government policy.
It's not propaganda.

581
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:02,190
It's not this,
it's not that they don't fucking get it.

582
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:05,100
And if you just actually just said,
look dude,

583
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,280
here's the way it is.
Here's the reality of the situation,

584
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:13,430
which no buddy does.
That's the whole fucked up thing is 

585
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,930
nobody sits there and says,
this is actually what happens.

586
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,620
This is the truth.

587
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,720
Well,
you're not saying you're incorrect.

588
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,610
It's not,
it's you,

589
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,900
you do it.
Your motherfucker.

590
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,880
Y'All fucking channel does it.
What are you talking about?

591
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,980
It's,
there's guys like you,

592
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:30,981
there's this,
there's the congressmen that are coming 

593
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:30,981
up like Daniel Seaman,
the congressional representative,

594
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:35,460
or a candidate rather who is completely 
honest and well read.

595
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:36,710
And the young,
there's a,

596
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,720
there's a whole group of people that are
coming up now.

597
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,840
There's a bunch of people that are 
broadcasting,

598
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:44,760
whether it's the young Turks or whether 
it's,

599
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:45,390
uh,
you know,

600
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,200
any,
a number,

601
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:49,050
you know,
and Alex Jones to a large extent,

602
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:54,051
a lot of what Alex Jones says,
although absolutely ridiculed in the 19 

603
00:27:54,051 --> 00:27:56,130
nineties,
shows to be true in 2012.

604
00:27:56,131 --> 00:28:01,131
I've been Alex's friend for a long 
fucking time and a lot of people think 

605
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:02,790
he's crazy and he's fucking crazy.
That's why they think he's crazy.

606
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,320
But he's crazy in a beautiful way.

607
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,650
And he's right a lot of the time.
And that's sort of,

608
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:13,190
that's sort of understood now and 
there's enough information now that 

609
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,370
people have their head collectively 
cocked sideways.

610
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,420
I think the whole United States is like,
wait a minute,

611
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:23,570
there's something I tweeted yesterday 
that someone tweeted me and I've read 

612
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,571
tweeted it was 33 different conspiracy 
theories that turned out to be correct.

613
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,310
And when you go and look at them and you
go,

614
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,330
oh,
okay,

615
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:33,090
this is just.
This is sort of how it's always been.

616
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:38,270
So what we have to do is figuring out 
how to get these people that are 

617
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,650
thinking this way and this crazy 
position of power where they,

618
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,860
whatever group,
however many agree to do something 

619
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,910
totally a moral and for profit.
I guess that's really the only real 

620
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,310
reason.
Whenever it comes down to it,

621
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:55,820
we have to figure out how to reach 
people like that and to let them know 

622
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,511
that this is a false pattern.
Your mind is locked in some nonsensical 

623
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:05,931
thinking that is based on the predatory 
instincts of animals that had to survive

624
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:11,160
from fucking cougars and Jaguars and 
bears and shit.

625
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:16,370
There was a ruthlessness that's designed
into the DNA to make sure that the 

626
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:21,351
animal procreates and that can be 
overcome and that we have to understand 

627
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:25,821
that the only,
the only way to true happiness is to 

628
00:29:25,821 --> 00:29:28,551
look at each other collectively as if 
it's us living another life and you look

629
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:31,410
at every person you meet because if it's
you living with,

630
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,110
but also just to,
to,

631
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:33,770
to,
to.

632
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,550
I agree with you 100 percent because it 
sounds like hippie.

633
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:36,960
No,
no,

634
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,480
but,
but,

635
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:38,890
but you look at you and you say,
look,

636
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:40,390
here's a guy,
you know,

637
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,580
ufc came up,
taekwondo,

638
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,980
Chevy's,
you're fighting guy.

639
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,990
You know all this stuff.
Obviously we're two guys here sitting 

640
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:48,990
here.
We're not hippies.

641
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,610
But what we're coming to is,
is saying,

642
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,780
look,
we came up,

643
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,850
we came up hard,
we fought,

644
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:57,760
we did all this stuff and now we're 
realizing this shit.

645
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:58,840
And we're saying,
hey,

646
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,450
you know,
we've seen this.

647
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,660
We've learned from.
This is why to go back to it is I don't 

648
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,060
want politicians representing me who 
don't understand this.

649
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,640
Yeah.
Which is I came up hard.

650
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,130
I came up from the streets.
I learned this shit,

651
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:20,131
I learned that the hard way by going to 
these places and what I've realized is 

652
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:25,290
exactly what you said,
which is unless we've overcome our base 

653
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,590
desire,
which is I hate you,

654
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,960
I'm going to fucking bomb you.
We're all dead.

655
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,750
We're all dead because now it's not a 
knife.

656
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,240
It's not a gun.
It's not an RPG.

657
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,290
It's not a tank.
It's a new kid or fucking warhead.

658
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,080
And when we start fucking trying to 
fucking be alpha male with a nuclear 

659
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,430
warhead like Achy Yukon,
then we're fucking.

660
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:46,690
Where's that guy is?
He's still alive.

661
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,650
He's still alive.
He's still alive.

662
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:55,140
He's in Pakistan Christ.
And he's the reason why there's the 

663
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,170
proliferation of nuclear fucking.

664
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:01,250
Does he have technology?
20 bitches around him just dancing in 

665
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,340
their underwear at all times.
Do you think so,

666
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,030
but no.
Be a fucking man with it.

667
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:09,190
At least if you've got to be at concord,
be a fucking old school cafe.

668
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:14,040
He has a bunch of Isi guys around him at
all times because those guys,

669
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:19,130
those guys.
So the ISI is the CIA of Pakistan and 

670
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:24,471
they started the Taliban and they are 
the guys who are basically running 

671
00:31:24,471 --> 00:31:28,041
Pakistan and they are the guys who were 
becoming increasingly radicalized and 

672
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:29,100
they're the guys who were saying,
we are going to bomb India,

673
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,810
needed to get those people on mushrooms.
What we need to do is just say,

674
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,070
you're not allowed.
You're not allowed to blow up the world.

675
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,660
You cannot do it.
And by the way,

676
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,270
if we had politicians who were doing the
right thing,

677
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,480
you would go to India,
go to Pakistan and say you're not 

678
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,511
allowed.
Which means that we have to say Russia 

679
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:53,511
is not allowed.
We're not allowed.

680
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,140
Nobody's allowed.
Because again,

681
00:31:55,141 --> 00:32:00,141
to go back to it,
if you're playing roulette and double 

682
00:32:00,141 --> 00:32:02,370
zero means the end of the fucking world,
you shouldn't be playing fucking relax.

683
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,340
And so take that double zero off the 
fucking

684
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,670
board police.
If you're playing Russian roulette,

685
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,700
you have five chances to not get shot in
the head when you're playing world 

686
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:19,701
dominance.
It's like how many opportunities you 

687
00:32:19,701 --> 00:32:19,701
have to start a nuclear war.
Exactly.

688
00:32:19,701 --> 00:32:21,800
It's really not a question,
not a question of,

689
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,880
of when,
if it's a question of when.

690
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,830
Yeah,
there's not a whole lot of chambers.

691
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:30,831
It's the whole thing is fucking 
ridiculous because it's people locked up

692
00:32:31,171 --> 00:32:36,171
in this idea that somehow or another 
conquering makes things better and then 

693
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:39,800
somehow under the controlling the 
resources makes things better.

694
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:44,801
And this,
this all these observations now from 

695
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:44,801
people that are,
uh,

696
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:47,990
paying attention to what's going on in 
Afghanistan about minerals,

697
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,320
minerals,
and how long they've known that 

698
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,661
Afghanistan is.
It's an incredible deposit and mineral 

699
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:55,661
minerals from Congo.

700
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,740
Yeah.
What's happening?

701
00:32:56,741 --> 00:33:01,741
What's happening now in the Congo is 100
percent due to Colton.

702
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,840
They wouldn't be fighting.
They wouldn't have all the money,

703
00:33:04,841 --> 00:33:07,030
they wouldn't have tram Colton,
Colton.

704
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:12,450
Colton is a,
is a rarer thing wrong that makes all 

705
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,020
your iphone,
your Samsung,

706
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,320
your ipad.
They all need Colton,

707
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,480
uh,
to actually work.

708
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,340
And the majority of Colton actually is 
in Congo.

709
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:29,050
And so what's happened now is this 
continual warfare,

710
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,330
um,
you know,

711
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,690
and it's,
I believe now the sixth bloodiest war in

712
00:33:32,691 --> 00:33:36,370
the history of humanity is all happening
because of ipads,

713
00:33:36,371 --> 00:33:37,540
iphones,
samsungs,

714
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,610
all these things.
We're buying them.

715
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:41,410
This is the whole thing were 
disconnected.

716
00:33:41,411 --> 00:33:42,520
I mean,
I grew up thinking,

717
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,050
well,
whatever happens in Africa,

718
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,460
in Africa,
and that's their problem,

719
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:47,260
not my problem.
Then you realize,

720
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:52,290
oh,
that fucking war is happening because I 

721
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,290
have an iphone five.
I mean,

722
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,720
that's the reality of the situation.

723
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,570
It's sort of analogous to the human 
experience.

724
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:03,350
If you really,
boy,

725
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:06,770
that sounds gay,
hippie and gay at the same time.

726
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,240
So we're really having a love fest to 
pick up a confused dude

727
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,660
in the new,
in the new

728
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,060
studio,
the human.

729
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:18,340
If you look at the human experience and 
you look at where we're at right now at 

730
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:23,431
the highest levels and let's perceive at
the highest levels are innovation and 

731
00:34:23,431 --> 00:34:27,331
technology.
And that the fact that we can broadcast 

732
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,121
this with minimal cost,
even though it's kind of sucking right 

733
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:30,690
now,
powerful att and t the.

734
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,460
Why'd you get DSL?
I don't know,

735
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:34,570
man.
I had a fucking.

736
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,170
Who did this manager handle this shit.
Oh,

737
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:38,030
does this business manager?
Uh,

738
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,100
I dunno.
I never met him.

739
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,970
Listen to it.
You need a young kid do that shit.

740
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,240
I got shit I need to deal with.
This is not one of them.

741
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,830
You've thrown me off.
Where was I?

742
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,270
Minerals.
Everything Metro's earlier.

743
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,570
Whatever.
What's the.

744
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,020
Is it important that I finished my 
sentence?

745
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,600
I have nothing to say.
Ladies and gentlemen of grandstanding.

746
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:03,601
Clearly I'm trying to somehow or another
project project better ideas through 

747
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:09,451
whiskey.
Three whiskey and marijuana allegedly 

748
00:35:09,451 --> 00:35:12,730
allegedly don't think it's necessarily a
bad thing.

749
00:35:12,731 --> 00:35:15,220
Folks.
Sounded like Colin Quinn there.

750
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,120
You've got to irrigate.
Yeah,

751
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,570
irrigate the mine.

752
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,120
Yeah.
That's important.

753
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,040
People don't drink.
I've never been drunk.

754
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,050
I don't really like you.
Nor do I trust you.

755
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,430
Okay.
I'm going to be honest.

756
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,860
I trust drunks.
I even trust dry drunks.

757
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,630
I trust her.
Just saying that because I'm here.

758
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,350
Nope.
No,

759
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,730
I'm just being honest.
I,

760
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:32,390
I,
uh,

761
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:34,970
I appreciate sober people.
Don't get me wrong,

762
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,540
but if you have not a least experienced 
whiskey with all the people raving about

763
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:44,541
it,
would you not dive in the water so at 

764
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:44,541
least once?
How stubborn are you?

765
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,650
You've never had a drop of alcohol.
Who are you partying with?

766
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:48,390
Man,
that's ridiculous.

767
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,420
If your friends have kept you from a 
drop of alcohol,

768
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,560
they're assholes.

769
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,350
It's usually people that have had too 
many drops of alcohol.

770
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:57,280
It seems like everyone I know is in a 
hour.

771
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,630
Well,
you know what?

772
00:35:58,631 --> 00:36:03,631
The issue is slightly biological and 
that's something that I'm willing to 

773
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:05,020
admit 100 percent because I have friends
that I trust dearly,

774
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,890
like Fitzsimmons.
Greg Fitzsimmons is greg and I have been

775
00:36:08,891 --> 00:36:11,740
friends since we were in our early 
twenties.

776
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:16,741
I think we met when I was 21 and Greg 
was probably the same age greg has 

777
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:17,650
always had.
He's.

778
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,540
He's a legit alcoholic and it's in the 
sense of he could have a drink today and

779
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:25,210
he could be fine,
but there will be a pole,

780
00:36:25,211 --> 00:36:29,680
a biological pool that's reinforced by 
his relatives.

781
00:36:29,681 --> 00:36:34,681
It's reinforced by generations and I 
have many friends that have this issue 

782
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:36,670
and I do not discount it.
My friend Tate Fletcher,

783
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:39,550
he's a brilliant guy and tate has a 
problem with substances.

784
00:36:39,551 --> 00:36:40,870
He cannot,
you know,

785
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,650
he's like,
I go,

786
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:43,930
could you even like take a look,
a baby hit of a joint?

787
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:49,110
He goes,
maybe or I could wake up in an alleyway 

788
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,650
naked and not know what the fuck 
happened and I'm not willing to make 

789
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:52,840
that jump.
I'm not willing to take that chance.

790
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,650
There's biological weirdness.
People fucking get.

791
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,380
They die from peanuts.
Okay.

792
00:36:59,381 --> 00:37:01,510
A person can be allergic to peanuts and 
die.

793
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,550
I would never discount that,
but I think that generally speaking,

794
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:12,540
there's a mentality of non chance taking
boring bullshit that comes with the.

795
00:37:14,861 --> 00:37:16,420
I've never had a drink.
People.

796
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,540
There's a few examples that are 
contrary,

797
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:24,541
like Penn Jillette has never had a drop 
of alcohol and the only time he's ever 

798
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:27,010
had any sort of medication.
There's been injured after surgery,

799
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,540
like a,
some sort of a painkiller,

800
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,520
but he's a brilliant guy and I love 
talking to him.

801
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:35,550
He's one of the rare examples.
Most people that have never even been 

802
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:35,550
fucked up,
you never.

803
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,950
You never tried to get laid when it was 
preposterous.

804
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,710
You've never tried to pick up a girl 
with.

805
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:45,711
There's no way medically you can get an 
erection if you've never been 21 years 

806
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:48,250
old and thrown up in the backseat of a 
cab.

807
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,160
Who are you?
Who are you and who do you party with?

808
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,590
But I also think that it's,
again,

809
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:58,591
to go back to the people we're talking 
to is it's a way to sort of distance 

810
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:03,961
yourself from all the norms and to say,
I'm going to question what the fuck's 

811
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:09,541
going on.
I think and maybe some conspiracy 

812
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:09,541
theories are not true and maybe some 
aren't true,

813
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,680
but at least we have to question them.
Oh,

814
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:13,180
for sure.
There's a lot that aren't true,

815
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,690
but for sure there's not,
but we have to question them.

816
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:17,440
Yes.
And that's the whole thing.

817
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,630
We have to question shit.
That's our.

818
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,100
That's what we are as humans.
We have to fucking shit.

819
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,900
And we also have to say,
how do we get better?

820
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,740
It's a funny thing to say,
but I'm not endorsing alcohol 

821
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,361
consumption,
but there's a certain humility that 

822
00:38:36,361 --> 00:38:36,361
comes from being an drunk.

823
00:38:36,361 --> 00:38:38,470
Will you step back and kind of,
you know,

824
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,690
you just realize like,
look,

825
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:42,010
this is all fun.
You know,

826
00:38:42,011 --> 00:38:45,070
like Tony Bourdain,
you know Anthony Bourdain,

827
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,390
I've had the pleasure of having on the 
podcast.

828
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,350
He said,
Guy,

829
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,600
just like you,
a regular dude,

830
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,660
you talk to them,
but there's a certain like having a 

831
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,390
drink with you,
having a drink with him,

832
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,740
having a drink with anyone who's just a 
real guy.

833
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:07,830
Anyone who's where,
where there's a moment that comes when 

834
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,110
you've had a couple of drinks.
When you look at each other.

835
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:08,170
Yeah,

836
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,650
we're fucked up.
Who knows?

837
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:13,620
It's crazy,
but he's a perfect example of a dude.

838
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:18,770
Yeah.
I had a cooking show on the travel 

839
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:18,770
channel.
Well before that,

840
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,890
he's a chef.
He was a chef.

841
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,660
Wrote a book,
but the book,

842
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,730
it's told truth,
but what the hell happens in 

843
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,420
restaurants.
Exactly.

844
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:32,450
But he had it.
He had a cooking show on the travel 

845
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:32,450
channel,
nothing in nothing,

846
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:37,190
and he turned it into a political 
statement and he turned it into trying 

847
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,790
to tell the truth and he turned it into 
we're going to eat some food,

848
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,360
but what the fuck is really going on 
with real people?

849
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,100
Yes,
and I think again,

850
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,410
there's a lot.
There's a whole movement.

851
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,430
There's you,
there's him,

852
00:39:47,431 --> 00:39:48,090
there's me,
there's,

853
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:50,160
but there's like $100,
million.

854
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:55,580
There's millions of this now because of 
technology and I think that you know him

855
00:39:57,601 --> 00:40:00,810
and I believe he built the travel 
channel on his.

856
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,970
What about Bert Kreischer?
How do you feel about Bert?

857
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,440
Bert?
Bert Dot com.

858
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,200
Just to finish with,
with Anthony Bourdain.

859
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:12,470
I would say that that guy,
that guy went out into the world and,

860
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,200
and talked about shit that you should 
talk about on a channel that would never

861
00:40:19,471 --> 00:40:21,690
talk about that shit otherwise.
And a channel by the way.

862
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:24,630
That's very conservative on by script.
Yeah.

863
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,390
Which is the server scripts.
Scripts.

864
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,030
Yeah.
So travel channels on prescriptions,

865
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,370
pps.
It's a very Christian fundamentalist and

866
00:40:35,371 --> 00:40:40,371
he takes a lot of heat and he gets a lot
of shit and they tell them not to do 

867
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:40,371
stuff and he says,
fuck you,

868
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:45,261
I'm going to do it anyway because he 
wants to fucking tell the truth and I 

869
00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:46,260
got to give it up to him.
He has a lot of fun

870
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,560
in their defense and their defense.
I do understand that the travel channel 

871
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,441
has started to try to reevaluate their 
position and maybe reach out because I 

872
00:40:55,481 --> 00:41:00,481
heard they're interested in Arusha fear 
because some of their executive saw him 

873
00:41:00,481 --> 00:41:02,030
kill at the dcm product and so they 
just.

874
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,010
But bordain ordain me like,
look,

875
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,060
he opened the door.
Oh No.

876
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,190
DRIPS is super,
super conservative.

877
00:41:07,191 --> 00:41:12,191
Super Christian.
Their poster child is a dude who goes 

878
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:13,220
out in the world and says,
you will eat some food.

879
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:18,221
We'll cook some shit,
but I'm going to tell you the fucking 

880
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:18,221
truth about what's going on.
What he did.

881
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:18,221
He.
He said,

882
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:20,930
I'm going to show you some cool shit.
I'm going to show you some cool music.

883
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:26,140
I'm going to show you should cool bands 
and I'm going to talk about and people 

884
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,720
are going to talk about what's really 
going on

885
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,090
and people are going to go,
by the way,

886
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,570
watch the travel channel.
Okay.

887
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,500
I Bert Kreischer,
I love him to death.

888
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,040
I would totally watch any show that

889
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,040
he's on,
but I never watch the travel channel 

890
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,040
before.
Anthony Bourdain was never.

891
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,000
I never even thought about watching it.
I don't know how I even tuned into his 

892
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,390
show.
I suspected I was just channel surfing.

893
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:46,790
Yeah,
I was just flipping through channels and

894
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:52,090
all the sudden there's this guy's 
talking about Vietnam and how much he 

895
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:52,400
loves Vietnam.
And I remember going,

896
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:57,430
who is this crazy fuck my barrier and 
camels and he's loving it.

897
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,890
And,
but most importantly,

898
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:05,891
he approaches the whole thing with this,
this really palpable feeling of humility

899
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:11,210
and honesty and you know,
pie drunkenness on occasion and it's,

900
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,040
uh,
it's,

901
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,810
it's not just admirable.
It's enticing,

902
00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:16,610
it's attractive.
It pulls me,

903
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,070
you know,
it's like your shows all of your shows,

904
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:21,650
man.
I found out about vice because of the,

905
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:24,320
uh,
the Heinemann x a episode.

906
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,500
The guy who lives in the Arctic,
where does he live in northeast Alaska 

907
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:29,900
or something like that.

908
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,590
He lives in the most remote part of the,
of the world.

909
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,090
He's the,
he lives.

910
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,880
He's the most remote human being in the 
world.

911
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:38,930
There's um,
uh,

912
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,340
I have a message board on my website and
the message board is before twitter,

913
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:45,940
it's been around since like 1998.
My,

914
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,930
my friend Andrew started the message 
board and it's been this incredible like

915
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,980
magnet for fucking Weirdos and a lot of 
cool people.

916
00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:00,220
But what's,
what's been really fascinating that 

917
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,320
twitter is sort of surpassed it in a way
just because of the sheer access.

918
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:08,530
But what my message board became was 
just this strange area where cool shit 

919
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:13,100
would be drawn to.
So they would post these things,

920
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,820
these threads about shit you would never
find out on your own.

921
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,790
Just the average person is not connected
to community.

922
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,470
You're never gonna find it.
What do you,

923
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,990
why would you even look at [inaudible] 
Dot com?

924
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,990
Why would you,
what would you be googling that would 

925
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:29,060
connect you to a series?
Someone put up this,

926
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:34,061
uh,
this link to this video and I watched 

927
00:43:34,061 --> 00:43:36,221
this guy that's got frozen caribou 
hanging from a fucking tree and he saw 

928
00:43:36,221 --> 00:43:39,230
them and cooking them and your guys that
were there,

929
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:44,231
which is blown away by the experience of
hanging out with this dude lives in a 

930
00:43:44,231 --> 00:43:48,251
100 foot square shack in the fucking 
most hostile environment,

931
00:43:50,091 --> 00:43:55,091
known demand and to see that he was not 
only was he not a loon but that he was,

932
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,920
there was no narration.
The narration was just sort of 

933
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:02,920
describing how they got there and what 
was going on,

934
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,720
but it was never.
It was never any judgment on people or 

935
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,640
the scenario and w w what I found really
fascinating about it,

936
00:44:10,641 --> 00:44:13,310
I was like,
you got to know a guy with all the.

937
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:18,410
And Hind mole has lived here for 65 
years.

938
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:23,030
He used content wondering the frozen 
countryside,

939
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,560
hoping to spot a Caribou.
Is He happy?

940
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,200
Only high mode truly knows you didn't do
that.

941
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:31,730
You,
you,

942
00:44:31,731 --> 00:44:36,731
you instead inserted intelligent people 
into a alternative sort of a situation.

943
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:38,670
This sounds like a Bologna.

944
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:44,050
No Bro.
Fucking watch this one live is,

945
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:53,110
it's because we practice it.
A type of journalism called immersion 

946
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,070
isn't where we go.
We immerse ourselves in the actual story

947
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,220
and we just pressed record.
You guys changed this podcast?

948
00:44:58,330 --> 00:44:58,450
No,

949
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,500
I want you to know that for sure.
One hundred percent that,

950
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:06,501
that episode and the subsequent episodes
that I watched all the devil you guys 

951
00:45:06,501 --> 00:45:09,420
changed because I was like,
this guy is a fucking.

952
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,190
You're in,
you're there,

953
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:15,000
you're actually there.
You know you're really going to write.

954
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:17,830
When I was making fun of kissing 
someone's Dick,

955
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:24,580
but I will say talking about twitter is 
after I do this podcast,

956
00:45:24,611 --> 00:45:29,611
you get so much response from people who
give a shit and people who are saying 

957
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,930
this shit like the truth and it blew my 
mind and this and that,

958
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:36,890
and you realize like,
you know,

959
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:38,370
we're guys just,
you know,

960
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,500
talking about shit and whatever and 
they're going,

961
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:46,530
this is.
I learned more on that podcast and Fox 

962
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,771
and MSNBC and CNN and everybody all put 
together and that's the tragedy.

963
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,400
It's,
it's great.

964
00:45:51,401 --> 00:45:56,401
For us,
it's the tragedy because we're just 

965
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:56,401
regular dudes going,
okay,

966
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:58,760
this is what the fuck is happening.
Don't think it's a tragedy,

967
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,100
man.
I think it's the the,

968
00:46:00,101 --> 00:46:03,340
the normal chain of progression and I 
think it's a natural.

969
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:08,610
It's a natural system and I think that 
you don't get to be you unless you've 

970
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:13,010
seen burt reynolds get a crazy facelift,
right?

971
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:18,300
You don't get to be you until you've 
seen all the most preposterous shit that

972
00:46:19,691 --> 00:46:24,691
people have done.
You don't get to be you until you read 

973
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:28,600
all the crazy accounts of nonsensical 
violence on the Internet,

974
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:33,630
either the crazy revolutions in Arab 
spring and all over the world and all 

975
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:37,921
the things you physically experienced by
actually being in these places where 

976
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:41,761
there are chaotic events that are just 
uncontrollable by the population

977
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:47,930
out of,
but it doesn't mean anything unless 

978
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,660
people watch.
It doesn't mean anything unless there's 

979
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:50,660
an audience.
It doesn't.

980
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:50,890
The you're compelled like you,
you,

981
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:56,030
you,
you can't even take credit for what 

982
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:57,460
you're doing because you're compelled.
You're compelled by the natural order of

983
00:46:57,461 --> 00:47:02,461
the universe.
The natural order of the universe is to 

984
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:05,251
move in and in a progressive direction 
and the more understanding and more 

985
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:08,500
comprehensive and lightened direction.
That's all of our ideas.

986
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,190
The idea is not to maintain the science 
of the 17 hundreds.

987
00:47:12,191 --> 00:47:14,620
The idea is to figure out how to,
you know,

988
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:19,830
how to get on Mars and create an 
atmosphere so we can have a new plan in 

989
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:23,371
case someone gets hit by an asteroid.
The ideas that are consistently move 

990
00:47:23,371 --> 00:47:27,181
forward and I think we're just caught in
the struggle of that happening and my 

991
00:47:28,091 --> 00:47:30,040
real hope for,
for the world.

992
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:30,900
Like I,
I,

993
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,810
you know,
all that shit about a gi.

994
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,840
The people that believe that you can 
manifest reality.

995
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,840
They know the secret and the idea that 
you know your own mind and the more you 

996
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,990
focus on things,
maybe maybe,

997
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:49,020
maybe it's just the fact that you're not
paying attention to what you could do 

998
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,340
positively.
And that's what impacts the world.

999
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:56,670
And positively.
What we've got to figure out how to do 

1000
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:00,090
is to change the mindset of all the 
people and the people that are in 

1001
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:04,261
positions of power instead of fighting 
them and attacking them and try to 

1002
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:09,450
understand the fact that the human 
animal is incorrect,

1003
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,160
doubly frustrated.
We don't know what's going on.

1004
00:48:12,161 --> 00:48:17,161
We have these fucking bodies that are 
exactly the same as pre internet pre 

1005
00:48:17,951 --> 00:48:22,951
movies,
Prix cars and planes and it's all 

1006
00:48:22,951 --> 00:48:26,551
happened so quickly all around us that 
we haven't had the chance to really as 

1007
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:29,590
as a,
as a super organism,

1008
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:34,400
taken all of the knowledge and 
distribute it in a way that w,

1009
00:48:34,401 --> 00:48:39,401
w,
w where we we govern over the 

1010
00:48:39,401 --> 00:48:41,350
consciousness of the population in a 
fair and ethical way.

1011
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:46,351
That keeps everybody happy,
but I think ultimately that that is a 

1012
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:48,370
possible scenario for sure.

1013
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,060
It has to be.
Has to be.

1014
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,020
If we don't believe that,
then we're really fucked.

1015
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,420
I don't think,
because I was saying doom and gloom.

1016
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:58,290
I don't think this is doom and gloom.
I think this is positive because as long

1017
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:03,291
as we know what the fuck is going on,
we can work towards doing something 

1018
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:06,471
about it.
The problem is is we didn't know what 

1019
00:49:06,471 --> 00:49:06,860
the fuck was going on because nobody 
fucking told.

1020
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,110
That's a perfect way of describing it.
That's a perfectly describing it.

1021
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,500
The real problem is that we were living 
in some crazy movie.

1022
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:21,860
We since the 19 fifties,
we have been locked into some sort of 

1023
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:26,150
crazy version of the world that is in 
many ways based on fiction and the real 

1024
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:31,680
issue is whether the war of the worlds,
even when the war of the worlds.

1025
00:49:31,681 --> 00:49:32,190
You've got to Piss.

1026
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:33,830
No,
you got to go.

1027
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,370
No,
no.

1028
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:37,070
What are you doing in your head?
I'm going to go and get a drink of it.

1029
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,470
I didn't want you to say that.

1030
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:42,490
The war of the worlds freaked fucking 
people out.

1031
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:45,700
If you don't know what it is,
Orson Welles in like,

1032
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:48,190
who knows when the fuck it was.
Alex wants to get out of here,

1033
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:49,360
but it's not happening.
Bitch.

1034
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,600
Take a seat.
Don't worry about your previous 

1035
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:54,600
commitments.
They're not as interesting.

1036
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,470
The war,
the war of the worlds was the first time

1037
00:49:56,471 --> 00:50:01,471
where human beings were able to be 
tricked into thinking by Orson Welles 

1038
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:09,451
that there was an attack by alien beings
like people freaked out and it's really 

1039
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:14,500
difficult to discern how much of it as 
bullshit,

1040
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,810
how I,
how much of it actually happened because

1041
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:19,750
they say there were suicides.
Who knows what the actual statistics,

1042
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:24,751
where you know,
we're talking about the 19 thirties or 

1043
00:50:24,751 --> 00:50:27,571
whatever the fuck it was,
but the reality which is that human 

1044
00:50:27,571 --> 00:50:28,010
beings were not prepared for

1045
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,490
the information that was coming at them.
They were in prepared.

1046
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:36,230
That wasn't an,
that wasn't a regular part of their life

1047
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:41,380
where they had grown accustomed to 
having this fakery planted on them.

1048
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:44,050
It's not like today with the onion,
you know,

1049
00:50:44,051 --> 00:50:47,210
like every now and then I'll retweet an 
article and it turns out to be like some

1050
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,310
new fake onion,
like some,

1051
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,910
a bunch of dudes who like think that the
onion is cool.

1052
00:50:52,911 --> 00:50:55,370
So they create their own bullshit news 
story.

1053
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,650
Those motherfuckers and your retweet 
them.

1054
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,760
But that's to be expected that the,
the,

1055
00:51:00,761 --> 00:51:05,761
the,
the people that existed before the 

1056
00:51:05,761 --> 00:51:09,311
internet or before,
those are the people that sort of set 

1057
00:51:09,311 --> 00:51:11,060
this scenario.
They set the momentum of our culture and

1058
00:51:11,061 --> 00:51:14,960
they did not have access this shit.
We have now.

1059
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:20,110
The idea that we're so hung up on the 
brilliant wisdom of some people that 

1060
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,390
lived in the 17 hundreds and created the
declaration of independence,

1061
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,280
which by the way,
it was written on fucking hemp.

1062
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,530
The first drafts that the fact that 
we're committed to the ideology,

1063
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,170
these people that lived,
they didn't have

1064
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:35,290
car cars or 2000 years ago.
That's when religion started.

1065
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:37,360
And ever since then,
everything else is a cult.

1066
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:42,690
But 2000 years ago,
that's when we knew what the fuck was 

1067
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:42,690
going on.
Well,

1068
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:44,200
I've got to juggle my act about Romney,
that it's a cult when you know who wrote

1069
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:47,080
it,
because we can.

1070
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:52,290
It's not like we have to go back to some
fucking shit they found in Qumran that 

1071
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:52,990
was written on animal skins.
You know,

1072
00:51:52,991 --> 00:51:54,960
this is like we know the guy,
he was,

1073
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:57,610
his name is Joseph Smith and he was only
14.

1074
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,260
I mean this is not that confusing like 
you're a fucking cult man,

1075
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,430
but he found the book of Latter Day 
saints in his backyard.

1076
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:11,460
But you know,
what's beautiful about the Mormon 

1077
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,041
culture is that what I've learned from 
my personal experiences is that there 

1078
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:16,700
are certain people in this life and 
although I don't

1079
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:21,770
feel it's justified to lie to people,
there's certain people who do get by 

1080
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:26,380
better if they follow like at least a 
scaffolding of morality.

1081
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:31,650
Sure.
Some sort of something that lets them 

1082
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:34,511
believe that at the very top there's a 
Cherry and that cherries God and he's 

1083
00:52:34,511 --> 00:52:35,050
right up there on top of the whipped 
cream and you just got to get.

1084
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:39,290
I think that's the problem is that if 
you look at this,

1085
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:42,260
we were talking about global warming 
earlier and you say,

1086
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,150
okay,
yeah,

1087
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,840
Shit's fucked up.
The world is thinking we're not going to

1088
00:52:47,841 --> 00:52:50,570
believe in that because of God.
And you're like,

1089
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:55,600
yeah,
but you're going to die and your kids 

1090
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:55,600
are going to die and it's going to be 
bad if we don't just say,

1091
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,040
this is the thing that is bad that's 
happening in a sense.

1092
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:04,230
No,
because it's gotten whatever and they 

1093
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:04,760
want.
And I think it's this yearning to have.

1094
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:08,930
There's a rational being who has a plan 
for all of us.

1095
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,200
Well,
the fact of the matter is is we are 

1096
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,290
creating our reality and we are not a 
rational entity.

1097
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:20,560
Humanity isn't rational.
Humanity is irrational and complex and 

1098
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:25,301
fucked up and weird.
But at some point somebody has got to 

1099
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:25,301
come up and say,
yeah,

1100
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:26,680
rational and where we given.

1101
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:31,900
But there are certain things that we do 
which are self destructive.

1102
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,630
And by the way,
they have to stop.

1103
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:39,780
For example,
if you have the ability to destroy the 

1104
00:53:40,151 --> 00:53:41,710
fucking world,
which is my world,

1105
00:53:41,711 --> 00:53:43,660
you're destroying my world,
right?

1106
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,240
And you're halfway across the world over
there.

1107
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:51,070
If that's even a possibility that no is 
the answer,

1108
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:52,720
no,
I'm not going to let that happen.

1109
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,670
So that's why I keep preaching on this 
stuff.

1110
00:53:54,671 --> 00:53:59,671
Because when I went there and I said,
Bill Clinton said it's the end of the 

1111
00:53:59,671 --> 00:53:59,671
world by the way.
And I went,

1112
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:03,340
yeah.
And so when he left the presidency,

1113
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:08,341
he said,
that is the reason why cargo was more 

1114
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:09,670
between India and Pakistan was the 
glimpse of the end of the world.

1115
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:13,960
And then he got his dick sucked by young
and old.

1116
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:15,820
So

1117
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,900
that's why it takes blows house of 
interns.

1118
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:22,830
So why not at least enjoy that sweet 
release,

1119
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:23,370
eat,
drink,

1120
00:54:23,371 --> 00:54:25,700
and be merry phase,

1121
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:27,950
eat,
drink,

1122
00:54:27,951 --> 00:54:30,410
and be merry.
The problem with that is,

1123
00:54:30,411 --> 00:54:31,940
is when we went back,
we realized,

1124
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,580
oh,
it's fucking way worse than when he said

1125
00:54:34,581 --> 00:54:36,830
it was the end of the world.
So hold on,

1126
00:54:36,831 --> 00:54:38,030
hold on.
The whole thing is,

1127
00:54:38,031 --> 00:54:40,130
is though,
is we can stop it.

1128
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,580
We can say fuck it.
Fuck it.

1129
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:46,810
We can't just,
we just have to say there is,

1130
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,580
there can be no,
uh,

1131
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:54,590
you know,
intercontinental ballistic or nuclear 

1132
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:54,590
warheads.
There can be no,

1133
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:59,320
because what you're saying,
just so everybody understands what 

1134
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,890
you're saying then is as long as that 
technology is there,

1135
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:04,700
it will go to Iran.
It will go to Pakistan,

1136
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,090
it will go to Congo,
it will go to Libya,

1137
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,930
it will go because the technology is 
there.

1138
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:17,170
Right?
And what happens when Kadafi now could 

1139
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:19,901
fee is gone,
but what happens when Kadafi has 

1140
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:22,390
warheads?
What happens when a que con has 

1141
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:22,390
warheads?

1142
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:22,640
What happens when,
when Iran has words,

1143
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,880
when Israel attacks Iran,
because it can have a nuclear around 

1144
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:33,910
what's going to happen,
what will happen when they attacked 

1145
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:34,130
around?
Everybody knows.

1146
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:39,190
Everybody knows what will happen when 
they attack rent and it's going to be a 

1147
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:40,190
fucking catastrophe.
However,

1148
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,230
it's nothing zero compared to what's 
happening in India,

1149
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,720
Pakistan,
Israel and Palestine is like,

1150
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,840
you know like I guess when you're like 
20,

1151
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,880
21 and you have that one couple that 
just won't fucking break up and they 

1152
00:55:56,421 --> 00:55:58,970
keep fighting and they keep asking you 
for advice.

1153
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,630
What do you think I should tell her,
bro?

1154
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,310
What do you think?
There's tiller and I'm like,

1155
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,000
I think you should fucking run.
I know there's people now.

1156
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:10,390
Well yeah,
there's a lot of them that use that as a

1157
00:56:10,391 --> 00:56:11,280
distraction,
right?

1158
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:16,340
Don't they don't.
They aren't all conflicts ultimately 

1159
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:20,521
some form of distraction because if,
if the Israelis looked at the 

1160
00:56:21,071 --> 00:56:26,071
Palestinians that are suffering and 
these poor people that are trying to 

1161
00:56:26,071 --> 00:56:26,071
make

1162
00:56:26,071 --> 00:56:26,071
this sort of

1163
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:32,050
home for themselves in this Gaza region 
is very dangerous and hostile region.

1164
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,880
What if they treated them all as 
Israelis?

1165
00:56:34,881 --> 00:56:39,881
What if they treated them all as just 
fellow humans would if instead of 

1166
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:42,770
lumping them into groups based on 
ideology and who believes what old crazy

1167
00:56:42,771 --> 00:56:47,771
shit,
what if they just looked at him as 

1168
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:49,920
things that could be cousins that I mean
that would instantly changed the whole 

1169
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,681
thing.
The idea that we need to exist in a 

1170
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:55,040
conflict scenario.
Is that the problem?

1171
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:57,680
That's the real issue.
I don't agree with that.

1172
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:02,681
I have a neighbor,
I don't even know this motherfucker and 

1173
00:57:02,681 --> 00:57:02,681
he wanted me to chop down my trees,
but he's still nice.

1174
00:57:02,681 --> 00:57:05,160
I say hi to him when I drive by.
I had a convert.

1175
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,970
The only conversation I've ever had with
this guy was a conflict,

1176
00:57:07,971 --> 00:57:08,990
but I don't hate the dude.

1177
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,460
You know?
I want them to be happy.

1178
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:12,440
Just don't be crazy.
Let me alone your mother fucker.

1179
00:57:12,441 --> 00:57:13,340
I'll give you a hug.
Come here,

1180
00:57:13,341 --> 00:57:15,290
give me a what are you nuts,
you know,

1181
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:16,250
come on,
let's go have a drink.

1182
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,870
You know,
that's what we should treat.

1183
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,900
The whole world can approach other human
beings like that.

1184
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:28,480
It's just we have to get past this 
ingrained scenario that we have in our 

1185
00:57:28,731 --> 00:57:33,731
head,
which is that war is a part of nature 

1186
00:57:33,731 --> 00:57:34,010
and nature is unsurmountable.
It's,

1187
00:57:34,011 --> 00:57:35,900
it is what it is.
You got to accept,

1188
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:41,290
man,
they're gonna want to be philanders and 

1189
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:42,680
you know there's going to be conquest 
and swords and fucking rocket.

1190
00:57:42,681 --> 00:57:42,740
Yeah,

1191
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:47,810
but if you go,
if you go to Mexico and you see what's 

1192
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:47,810
happening there,
now it's the rule of the thug.

1193
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,380
If you go to Pakistan as the rule of the
thought,

1194
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:51,000
if you go to Congo,
it's the fuck.

1195
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:56,150
Why?
Because conflict breeds lowest common 

1196
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:59,871
denominator.
It breeds I have a gun and I'm willing 

1197
00:57:59,871 --> 00:57:59,871
to shoot it.
Right?

1198
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,490
And whoever that,
those aren't high thinking people.

1199
00:58:02,491 --> 00:58:04,830
Those aren't people thinking we're going
to save the world.

1200
00:58:04,831 --> 00:58:06,510
Those aren't people thinking,
you know,

1201
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:10,110
the world is thinking.
Those aren't people thinking we could,

1202
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,930
you know,
destroy the environment by,

1203
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:16,320
by having a new kid or standup.
What they're thinking is,

1204
00:58:16,321 --> 00:58:21,300
I'm going to gain power because I have a
bunch of guys,

1205
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,530
you know,
young guys,

1206
00:58:22,531 --> 00:58:27,531
you generally young men with guns.
If you look at what's happening in 

1207
00:58:27,531 --> 00:58:30,531
Europe right now,
this is what's terrifying is you go to 

1208
00:58:30,531 --> 00:58:30,531
Spain and you say Spain,
you know,

1209
00:58:30,531 --> 00:58:32,790
old country educated country,
you know,

1210
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:33,780
country.

1211
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,560
Fifty percent of young people are 
unemployed,

1212
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:41,010
so you've taken away their future.
We were just shooting.

1213
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:44,400
Their 6 million people came out and 
fucking shut the whole country.

1214
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:47,700
Then that's people who are pissed off,
really pissed off.

1215
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,410
While you were filming there,
what happened?

1216
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,740
Riots,
what,

1217
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:52,390
what would they have?
Well,

1218
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:54,510
there about us anti-austerity.
So it's,

1219
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:59,560
it's young people saying we're fucked,
but I mean there's riots in Paris and 

1220
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,270
how sturdy means.
What does that mean?

1221
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,950
So,
you know,

1222
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,800
Spain is fucked economically,
economically.

1223
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:07,320
What's happening there?
This is what's really terrifying is that

1224
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,760
in,
in,

1225
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,760
in so prolonged economic crisis.
So the recession.

1226
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:17,090
Now,
the last time this happened was the 

1227
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:17,090
depression.
Now what happened?

1228
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:19,320
Because of the depression was the rise 
of radical political solutions.

1229
00:59:19,321 --> 00:59:24,321
I eat communism or fascism.
So now what's happened is you have the 

1230
00:59:24,651 --> 00:59:26,570
rise of the Communist Party in,
in,

1231
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,680
in,
in Greece,

1232
00:59:27,681 --> 00:59:29,540
and to counteract that,
you have the golden dawn,

1233
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:32,830
which are full on fascists,
who now are,

1234
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,640
are,
are,

1235
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,330
you know,
14 percent of the government.

1236
00:59:35,331 --> 00:59:37,660
Did you say the Golden Dawn?
Golden Dawn are?

1237
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,260
Yeah.
That's what I heard.

1238
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,940
The Golden Dawn.
They have.

1239
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:43,370
They do this.
Say the golden dawn will pretend because

1240
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,330
it's ridiculous.
Whatever.

1241
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:45,330
Golden Dawn.
Yeah.

1242
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,180
Okay.
They do the.

1243
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,430
They do the Nazi salute.
They had the swastika

1244
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,140
saying,
imagine if they had a big fucking thing.

1245
00:59:51,141 --> 00:59:54,260
Other shirt was a big golden day.
Frothy dogs.

1246
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:59,380
Would it be,
would it be hard or would that be 

1247
00:59:59,380 --> 00:59:59,380
offensive for a military would have to 
be like,

1248
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:04,770
well,
they have the support of the military 

1249
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:05,890
and the police and everywhere we went 
was anti immigration,

1250
01:00:05,891 --> 01:00:07,240
anti EU,
anti this.

1251
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,100
After that,
and what's happening in Europe.

1252
01:00:09,101 --> 01:00:12,550
This is what's terrifying is because you
have an economic crisis,

1253
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,740
you have the rise of communist and 
fascist.

1254
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:19,770
So for example,
in France you have a very far left 

1255
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:23,101
government and the second party is from 
national fascist and you sit there and 

1256
01:00:23,101 --> 01:00:23,590
you say,
okay,

1257
01:00:23,591 --> 01:00:26,680
the exact same political situation 
exactly.

1258
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:31,390
That started World War Two is happening 
today in Europe,

1259
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:33,820
not fucking Africa,
not Pakistan,

1260
01:00:33,821 --> 01:00:35,260
not India,
Europe,

1261
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,350
and it's happening in Germany.
It's happening in Scandinavia,

1262
01:00:38,351 --> 01:00:40,030
it's happening in Spain and happening in
Italy.

1263
01:00:40,031 --> 01:00:45,031
It's happening in Greece,
it's happening in all these countries 

1264
01:00:45,031 --> 01:00:47,850
and you sit there and everyone just 
watching as exactly the same fucking 

1265
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,780
thing that started World War II to the 
t,

1266
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,420
to the fucking teeth,
riots in the streets,

1267
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,720
ultra right?
Ultra left wing parties fighting each 

1268
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,781
other,
radical parties getting more and more 

1269
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:00,781
power.
And you're just saying,

1270
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:04,210
what the fuck do we have to do to.
We have to relive it again.

1271
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,910
It's exactly the same thing that started
world,

1272
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,720
a natural cycle of humanity.
I mean,

1273
01:01:10,721 --> 01:01:13,640
if you look at societies,
you can look at cultures and you look at

1274
01:01:13,641 --> 01:01:17,460
this rise and fall.
When you go to the Acropolis and you see

1275
01:01:17,461 --> 01:01:20,740
the ancient Greek ruins and you wonder 
how the fuck why?

1276
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:24,710
Why are these regular houses like really
close to this incredible structure?

1277
01:01:24,711 --> 01:01:27,110
What happened is this,
is this inevitable?

1278
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:32,230
Do are we in this constant state of 
developing consciousness and one of the 

1279
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:38,620
big wrestling matches of trying to sort 
of innovate and accomplish higher levels

1280
01:01:39,351 --> 01:01:39,720
of,
of,

1281
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,880
of society and culture is that you,
you have to meet some sort of opposition

1282
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:50,860
and if you don't meet opposition,
you won't have the motivation to really 

1283
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:54,971
accelerate things as fast as the 
technology around you is accelerating 

1284
01:01:54,971 --> 01:01:57,650
and completely get out of hand like it 
is right now.

1285
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,920
It is right now with with dictators and 
crazy fucks controlling nuclear weapons 

1286
01:02:03,411 --> 01:02:06,500
almost.
It's almost like those things have to be

1287
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:09,650
in place in order to motivate the 
highest levels of thinking.

1288
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,200
You know the,
the,

1289
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:13,850
the,
the cliche is those who don't understand

1290
01:02:13,851 --> 01:02:18,851
history are doomed to repeat it.
What's interesting is when you go talk 

1291
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:21,490
to young people in Europe and you say,
understand that this is exactly the same

1292
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,890
thing that happened at the start of 
world war two.

1293
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:26,950
They were like,
don't you know,

1294
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,490
they don't know what you're talking 
about and they don't understand history.

1295
01:02:30,491 --> 01:02:34,000
The other thing is they don't understand
war and if you ever go look at war,

1296
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:37,840
and this is where I was talking about 
with the rack is war isn't the manly,

1297
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:41,170
you know,
I got my shoulder nicked by a,

1298
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:46,260
by a bullet or you know,
I come back with a purple heart or is a 

1299
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,590
catheter bag.
War is I don't walk again,

1300
01:02:47,591 --> 01:02:52,591
war is I'm irradiated.
War is I'm fucked up in the brain for 

1301
01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:52,591
the rest of my life.

1302
01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:55,150
And those who don't understand war are 
doomed to repeat it.

1303
01:02:55,151 --> 01:02:56,650
And by the way,
you know,

1304
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,930
hawks and people who say,
let's go to war,

1305
01:02:58,931 --> 01:03:00,760
let's go to war,
go to war,

1306
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:04,570
go see a war zone.
It's fucking tragic.

1307
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,960
It's tragic from start to fucking finish
its babies with no fucking fathers.

1308
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:13,870
It's every man fucking killed.
It's rape.

1309
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:14,860
It's,
you know,

1310
01:03:14,861 --> 01:03:17,690
in some cases in Africa cannibalism,
it's,

1311
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:22,740
it's literally the lowest form of what 
we are as humanity and people who say,

1312
01:03:22,781 --> 01:03:24,250
let's go to fucking war,
let's go to war.

1313
01:03:24,251 --> 01:03:29,251
Let's go to.
You should fucking realize that before 

1314
01:03:29,251 --> 01:03:29,251
you go to war,
young dudes,

1315
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:34,310
you know that we know are going to come 
back and their dick isn't going to work 

1316
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:34,310
again.
The fucking shit.

1317
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:34,310
Right.
Again.

1318
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:36,580
All this stuff and you go,
okay,

1319
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:40,810
that's what these people are proposing 
in Europe,

1320
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,000
in India,
in Pakistan,

1321
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:45,070
in Africa,
in Southeast Asia,

1322
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:48,160
in some cases in South America and in 
some cases here,

1323
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:49,840
that's what people are proposing.
You're like,

1324
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:55,080
what the fuck?
I would just like to take anyone who 

1325
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:55,080
wants to say,
let's go to war.

1326
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,371
I'd like to take them to a war zone 
because if you take people to a war 

1327
01:03:59,371 --> 01:03:59,371
zone,
first you puke,

1328
01:03:59,371 --> 01:04:00,600
then you cry and then you freaked the 
fuck up.

1329
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:06,240
People,
do you think in positions of power 

1330
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:06,240
actually go to war zones?
None.

1331
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,380
Wow.
And the what are some must.

1332
01:04:09,381 --> 01:04:09,640
I mean

1333
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:13,040
you see photos you don't,
but you don't see what it really does.

1334
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:18,400
So you don't see the reason why.
The reason why I do what I do is because

1335
01:04:20,961 --> 01:04:25,961
I've been to war zones and I've seen 
shit that makes your stomach turn and 

1336
01:04:25,961 --> 01:04:30,941
you'll never sleep right again,
because when you see what war really 

1337
01:04:30,941 --> 01:04:32,960
fucking doesn't talk to marines and 
talked to rangers and talked to guys who

1338
01:04:32,961 --> 01:04:37,961
come back from war,
talk to them before they go and then 

1339
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:41,381
talk to them when they come back.
It's a completely different fucking 

1340
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:41,381
conversation I have

1341
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:43,000
and it's very similar to people that I 
know that had been to jail.

1342
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:46,180
There's A.
I have a friend.

1343
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:51,690
We were friends when I was a teenager 
and he was always crazy and he just 

1344
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:56,821
vanished.
We didn't know what happened because I 

1345
01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:56,821
just knew him from the martial arts gym 
that I trained at,

1346
01:04:56,830 --> 01:05:01,270
but he came back three years later with 
all these crazy scars all over his body.

1347
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:05,350
He had been a prison and he was a 
completely different human being.

1348
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:10,590
It was like before he was as lovable 
troublemaker and three years later the 

1349
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:13,630
lovable troublemaker was gone.
There was a psycho.

1350
01:05:13,631 --> 01:05:16,750
There was a guy who had.
He would fight for survival.

1351
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:17,930
He was a wild animal.

1352
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,470
You won't come back normal.
You won't come back.

1353
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:21,010
No,
I know.

1354
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,800
I've met friends that have gone to war 
to.

1355
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:23,520
I've,
I've,

1356
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:28,810
I've had quite a few friends that were 
in the military and went over and came 

1357
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:30,750
back including a buddy of mine who went 
over as a mercenary.

1358
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:31,800
Yeah.
You know,

1359
01:05:31,801 --> 01:05:36,801
and it's a,
it's a weird conversation when you're 

1360
01:05:36,801 --> 01:05:36,801
alone,
you know,

1361
01:05:36,801 --> 01:05:37,080
sitting down on the curb somewhere.
Go on.

1362
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,370
So.
So would you have to do.

1363
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:41,030
What was it like what would you,
you know,

1364
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,300
how much they pay you?
Do you want to do it again?

1365
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:44,460
You're done.
I'm done.

1366
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:46,710
Are you sure?
Like what the fuck?

1367
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:51,770
There's,
there's realities in this world that I 

1368
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:54,561
think most people in their day to day 
existence do not consider as a part of 

1369
01:05:54,841 --> 01:05:58,590
the equation.
And those realities are real problem.

1370
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:02,790
The real problem for our culture because
not only are they disgusting but they're

1371
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,670
unknown.
They're avoidable there.

1372
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:09,740
Most of them are avoidable.
We have a distorted perception of what 

1373
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:10,560
can be done with the resources that we 
have in place.

1374
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,420
And I think that the sort of perception 
is based on greed.

1375
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:18,630
Yeah,
when you see war and the aftermath of 

1376
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:20,890
war,
which is again to describe it,

1377
01:06:20,891 --> 01:06:24,880
I'm not even going to do it justice,
but it milky eyes from chemical weapons.

1378
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:29,650
People with their limbs hacked off a 
systematically,

1379
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:31,450
um,
you know,

1380
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,250
women who have been raped,
uh,

1381
01:06:33,251 --> 01:06:34,420
you know,
50,

1382
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:35,230
70,
one,

1383
01:06:35,231 --> 01:06:36,850
hundred times,
you know,

1384
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:41,050
incredibly scarred people.
And by the way,

1385
01:06:41,051 --> 01:06:46,051
if you go over,
especially if you go over from our 

1386
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:48,241
culture,
spend three years in that culture and 

1387
01:06:48,241 --> 01:06:48,241
look,
it's chronicle after World War Two,

1388
01:06:48,241 --> 01:06:50,530
after Vietnam,
after Afghanistan,

1389
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,020
after Iraq,
and you go to these things,

1390
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:58,080
you will never be normal again.
You will never other mentally or 

1391
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:58,120
physically you will never be normal 
again.

1392
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:01,600
So why do we still fucking rattle our 
sabers?

1393
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:06,601
Why do we still say we're gonna fight?
Why do we still say we're going to fuck 

1394
01:07:06,601 --> 01:07:06,940
each other up?
And the thing is,

1395
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:08,890
is if you look at it and you say,
okay,

1396
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:12,810
why the fuck did we go to Iraq?
Why the fuck were we there?

1397
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,130
All these fucking guys,
all these marines,

1398
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,230
all these army guys who come back fucked
up.

1399
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:22,260
Why did you come back?
Why did you come back so fucked up and 

1400
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:22,260
you're never going to be normal again.
Why?

1401
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:24,970
Why was it al Qaeda?
Was it nine slash 11?

1402
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:25,480
No.

1403
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:31,640
Jesus Christ.
Shane Smith.

1404
01:07:31,641 --> 01:07:36,641
You motherfucking Downer.
I was going to go home tonight and maybe

1405
01:07:37,131 --> 01:07:42,131
watch a little boardwalk empire.
Reminisce about how fucked up people 

1406
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:42,800
were in the past.
Have.

1407
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:43,700
That's your network

1408
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:49,500
by the way.
We're doing a new show and the other 

1409
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,491
thing is I will say this next year we're
launching a news channel in 18 

1410
01:07:51,491 --> 01:07:51,830
countries.
18 languages.

1411
01:07:51,831 --> 01:07:55,220
Twenty four hours news around the world.
Why?

1412
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:59,150
Because news is so fucked that we're 
going to do at news on her own.

1413
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:00,530
Fuck it.
Fuck you.

1414
01:08:00,531 --> 01:08:02,240
Fuck everybody.
We're going to do it on our own way.

1415
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,200
A lot of fucks buddy

1416
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:06,150
is out there.
I don't know if that's good Karma,

1417
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:08,780
Brian.
It's not.

1418
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:11,610
Brian says it's got to be careful with 
what you project

1419
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:16,670
and by the way,
I'm gonna have to go now because we're 

1420
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:16,670
launching news channel

1421
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:20,990
and we're going to go do the deal right 
now and I wanted to come here before we 

1422
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:21,900
did that because this is what I enjoy 
doing.

1423
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:24,480
Shane Smith,
you sir are a bad motherfucker.

1424
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:29,600
Thank you very much.
It's been an honor once again to have 

1425
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:29,600
you on the show.
You,

1426
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:29,600
uh,
you,

1427
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:29,880
uh,
honestly,

1428
01:08:29,881 --> 01:08:31,990
you,
you've changed this show for that first.

1429
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:36,330
Like just say this is the first fucking 
podcast from the new,

1430
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:39,090
the new studio,
which I fucking love.

1431
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:40,740
This is it.
I love this day.

1432
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:44,250
One of Internet sucks of fat Dick Joe 
Rogan.

1433
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,000
We will fix it though,
folks in.

1434
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:48,510
If it's possible we will fix it.
God Damn it.

1435
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:51,210
We will get a satellite for the roof.
Okay.

1436
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:56,360
That's even worse.
I think we're going to make this shit 

1437
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:56,360
happen.
Shane Smith.

1438
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:56,820
You bad motherfucker.
Follow him on twitter.

1439
01:08:56,821 --> 01:08:58,800
It's Shane Smith 30.
Why?

1440
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:02,610
Because Shane Smith anonymous is a 
greedy bitch.

1441
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,710
Doesn't want to give up his fucking 
name.

1442
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:05,910
Listen,
Shane Smith,

1443
01:09:05,911 --> 01:09:10,911
all I want you to do is go and watch a 
few videos of the real Shane Smith in 

1444
01:09:10,911 --> 01:09:14,220
the fucking Congo and you sir will give 
up your twitter name.

1445
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,340
Okay.
There is more important things than you.

1446
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:22,490
Can't you be snuggled bunny 69 or some 
shit son.

1447
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:28,610
Uh,
go to [inaudible] dot com and be 

1448
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:29,250
informed in an honest and real fashion.
You fucks.

1449
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:34,460
And one day soon there will be a show 
produced by advice that will be on h be 

1450
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:37,530
mother fucking.
Oh,

1451
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:39,150
and what is that?
What's it called?

1452
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:44,690
It's called Vice.
That's why you need to know why fuck 

1453
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:46,530
around and get creative and call it snow
flowers through an extra dimension.

1454
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:49,020
It would have been better for planet on 
Vance.

1455
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:52,020
I would've had some better things to say
there,

1456
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:57,110
but I ran into a wall shit time to pull 
myself out with August first.

1457
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:01,410
Brian Red Band,
August first or August.

1458
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,290
Why do I always say August and December?
It might be a little drunk.

1459
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:07,430
August and December to me,
for whatever reason,

1460
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:09,800
they blend together.
If you were,

1461
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:14,810
um,
if it's in August and you're listening 

1462
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,781
to this and in the future and it's the 
apocalypse and you go with the Moody 

1463
01:10:16,781 --> 01:10:17,390
Theater in Austin doesn't even exist 
anymore.

1464
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:22,750
I'm sorry,
I just went brain stumbled over my 

1465
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:22,750
words.
December first.

1466
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:25,040
It will be Dunkin motherfucking 
trussell,

1467
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:30,200
Brian motherfucking red band and me and 
will be at the Moody Theater in Austin,

1468
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:32,330
Texas,
which is if you're listening live,

1469
01:10:32,331 --> 01:10:33,710
which I don't think anybody is at this 
point,

1470
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:36,110
uh,
it will be this Saturday night,

1471
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,840
a December first.

Shane Smith drinks whiskey and allegedly
smoke cigarettes.

You could have all the Kale in the 
world.

Your Shit will end,
it will end,

1485
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:21,150
but what's what I'm trying to do is have
the,

1486
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,090
the part that's not ending as fun as 
possible,

1487
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:29,180
and what I found is that little Kale 
shakes actually help makes you feel 

1488
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:29,580
better.
It increases your mood.

1489

that's manly as fuck.
Those are called kettle bells.

1504
01:12:24,051 --> 01:12:26,820

beautiful human being.

1505
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:32,010
You know,
one of the coolest things about having 

1506
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:32,010
this podcast,
as I said before,

1507
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:35,721
is that I get to have these beautiful 
conversations with people like you or

people like any number of you.

A fascinating conversation list with a 
brilliant technological genius.

1513
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,060
I just said fascinating 
conversationalist.

1514
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:53,370
I think it might be time to pull the 
fucking plug.

1515
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,440

I'm,
I'm supposed to say it twice.

1521
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:13,310
Listen,
there's no structure to any of these 

1522
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:13,310
commercials,
but one thing that you can guarantee,

1523
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:14,400
ladies and gentlemen,
we will never,

1524
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:19,460
ever,
ever have something that we promote on 

1525
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:20,910

We're not trying to rip you off.

We're just trying to keep this pitch 
rolling.
