1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,680
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,400
Yeah.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,600
That's amazing man.

4
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,600
Now when you go and you do these,

5
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:05,920
uh,

6
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,080
these Mexico trips,

7
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:07,590
do you,

8
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,650
do you have someone who
guides you and keeps you safe?

9
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:11,484
Like how do you.

10
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,211
Because I taught,

11
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:14,700
we had Anthony Bordain on and he said
one of the things you've got to get a

12
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:16,920
local guy when you go
to these crazy spots,

13
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:18,190
you get a local guy who's,

14
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:18,860
you know,

15
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,770
a handler and that guy takes
care of everything in your town.

16
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,613
You pay him.

17
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:23,823
You guys do that?

18
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,983
Yeah.

19
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,291
Yeah.

20
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,730
You definitely have to have local guys.

21
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:29,550
I don't believe in security
or definitely not like,

22
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,493
you know,

23
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,540
for sure not like western body.

24
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,360
Ours are like pilgrims
or any of those big,

25
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,061
obvious,

26
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:38,730
visible big guy talking to
him to their arrest and shit.

27
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:41,510
That's just stupid because they're
just gonna attract attention.

28
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,690
Who the fuck is going on here?

29
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:43,770
Let's get them you.

30
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,270
Uh,

31
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,640
but definitely you need
local fixers in Mexico.

32
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,560
We have 34 offices around the world.

33
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:49,880
So we,

34
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,910
we have our own guys,

35
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,571
local guys,

36
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:52,560
pretty much everywhere.

37
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,900
And then you have like local fixers who,

38
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,240
you know,

39
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,071
know the terrain,

40
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:56,970
know the language,

41
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,630
know what's going on and
how to get you out of shit.

42
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,090
And you guys started this,

43
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:06,890
you were doing a magazine called voice
and then you took it over and took the o

44
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:08,240
out and just called it advice.

45
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:08,611
Yeah,

46
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:08,910
it was,

47
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,000
it was called Voice of
Montreal and it was a,

48
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,180
it was sort of a welfare
project in Canada,

49
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,050
uh,

50
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,940
run by Haitians and they were doing a
black history month thing and then they

51
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:23,400
figured they could get more money out
of the government by doing an English

52
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:25,620
language cultural publication.

53
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,490
And so we were all working there.

54
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,750
I wanted to be a writer.

55
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:31,171
So I was like,

56
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:31,411
oh,

57
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:32,370
finally got a job

58
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,190
and be welcomed back.

59
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:36,810
Was trying to separate
from the rest of Canada.

60
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:39,240
So like English language
publications became illegal.

61
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:41,670
So no audience.

62
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,990
And uh,

63
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,070
so anyway,

64
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,310
eventually they couldn't
pay us our wages and stuff.

65
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:47,641
So we said,

66
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:47,821
okay,

67
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:48,840
well we own it now.

68
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,810
So we dropped the O and
just call it advice.

69
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:52,840
And like,

70
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,131
there was like,

71
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:53,850
what a great name.

72
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,683
How'd you,

73
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,660
how'd you think it?

74
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,040
And we're like,

75
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,940
we just dropped the o,

76
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,853
you know,

77
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,400
and it's a perfect story.

78
00:01:59,460 --> 00:01:59,821
Yeah.

79
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:01,920
And then we moved to
the states and then we,

80
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,070
then we started expanding and
now we're in 34 countries.

81
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,090
And where are you guys based out of?

82
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:06,990
You're based out of New York,

83
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,490
New York and London are two or two hubs
and our biggest office next year is

84
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:12,170
going to be in China.

85
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,260
And how long have you been doing this?

86
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,270
Sixteen years.

87
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,590
Holy Shit.

88
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,513
No Man.

89
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,410
God Damn.

90
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,350
Now it's music.

91
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:22,100
It's you even have a clothing
line and everything now.

92
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,290
It's a record label and films and TV and
a mag and online and all our different

93
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:29,220
verticals and events.

94
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:29,930
And

95
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,470
that's awesome.

96
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,350
Was this a plan from the very beginning
to branch off in all these different

97
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:35,660
directions and it just
sort of naturally happened?

98
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,991
Yeah,

99
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:36,260
no,

100
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,770
there was,

101
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,030
we never had a business plan.

102
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:39,080
We never knew anything.

103
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:40,970
We never thought about it really.

104
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,410
What happened was uh,

105
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:43,750
you know,

106
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,640
we wanted the outlawed
English basically in Quebec.

107
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:47,130
So we,

108
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,270
we went national in Canada where
the biggest magazine in Canada,

109
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:53,180
but that was like being the
biggest magazine in Reykjavik
or something where the

110
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:54,620
number one podcast in Canada,

111
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,213
Canada.

112
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,520
I love Canada.

113
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,453
I love Canada

114
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,800
to try.

115
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,960
I'm going to move if shit gets bad.

116
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,420
Well I came real close in 2004.

117
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:06,010
I was looking at space in Vancouver.

118
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,730
Really?

119
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,230
Yeah,

120
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,090
I was thinking about it.

121
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:08,500
I wouldn't,

122
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,333
I wouldn't,

123
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,020
you gotta go to the cause
it's going to get real bad.

124
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:15,500
You got to get to like one the
north of where I grew up in Ottawa.

125
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:16,850
There's like a million lakes.

126
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:18,350
You can just buy a lake
for like 100 bucks.

127
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,210
You got to buy a lake and you know,

128
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,770
build a cabin on the lake because
when she gets bad you go to get it

129
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,180
far away from the cities.

130
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,920
When it gets that bad though,

131
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:29,420
you might want to just die.

132
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,640
You want to live like in Liberia,

133
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:32,121
you know,

134
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:32,954
I don't want to.

135
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,381
I don't want to.

136
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:33,981
I want to live on.

137
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:35,510
I'd rather take a bullet know.

138
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,640
I'd rather take a bullet
and live like that.

139
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:39,440
Us a stump odm.

140
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:40,274
Flintstone.

141
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,113
Yeah.

142
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,210
I don't think he can pry.

143
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,480
I think that's a roamer.

144
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,081
Um,

145
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:45,914
so you,

146
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,030
so you guys started now,

147
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,290
how did you get started from going from
a magazine to these incredible in depth

148
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,940
on scene investigative
pieces that you're doing?

149
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,560
What was the first one?

150
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,090
Heavy metal in Baghdad.

151
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,953
So,

152
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,803
um,

153
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,940
we for about a decade,

154
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,320
we were kind of a style Mac,

155
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:10,760
so we were really just interested
in cocaine and supermodels

156
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,920
and so like these jeans are weird.

157
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,500
And uh,

158
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,430
we had,

159
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,330
it was because it was fun.

160
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,310
It was a lot of fun and we were kids and,

161
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,193
and uh,

162
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,630
and then when we started
expanding around the world,

163
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:26,250
we're like,

164
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,100
shit is fucked up.

165
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,640
Like,

166
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,151
holy fuck.

167
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:28,420
I mean,

168
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,141
have you seen this?

169
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:29,411
You know,

170
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:29,980
and,

171
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,610
and,

172
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,230
and we'd write about it and people like,

173
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,220
I've never heard about that,

174
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:34,011
what the fuck's going on?

175
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:34,331
And we're like,

176
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:34,710
yeah,

177
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,543
it's crazy.

178
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,240
So that happened as well as the sort
of failure of mainstream media during,

179
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,563
um,

180
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,310
you know,

181
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,380
the Iraq war,

182
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,303
um,

183
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,570
with everyone saying like,

184
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,510
weapons of mass destruction just lying
and they knew that there was no weapons

185
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:50,770
of mass destruction and all this shit.

186
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,413
And so,

187
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,050
um,

188
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,730
we did a thing where we went to,

189
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,200
we snuck into Iraq,

190
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,550
um,

191
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,550
and we went to hang out with the only
heavy metal band in Baghdad across the

192
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:05,650
counter and it was supposed to
be like a seven minute piece.

193
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:09,400
It was the first piece we
launched the VBS with and um,

194
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,570
you know,

195
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,200
eventually we shot them over three years
and we turned into a feature film that

196
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:18,730
one critic stories in Toronto at won
best documentary in Berlin film festival.

197
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:20,380
Like it got picked up by the BBC,

198
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:21,250
by Ken Blues.

199
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:21,901
Yeah.

200
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:23,360
A friend Eddie raves about it.

201
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:24,590
Eddie Bravo raves about that.

202
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,650
And so everyone's like,

203
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:27,610
you know,

204
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:27,761
oh,

205
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:28,690
that's like news,

206
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,171
you know,

207
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:29,630
we're like,

208
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,431
we're following a band.

209
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,900
But you saw the whole thing unfold,

210
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,550
like how everything was fucked up shit.

211
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,560
And people could relate
to it because like,

212
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:35,671
oh,

213
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,190
I'm in a band and then there are bad,

214
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,043
gets their,

215
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,160
a practice space,

216
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:41,310
gets bombed by a Scud
missile and you know,

217
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,630
they,

218
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,100
they,

219
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,960
they're going to be killed because they
were like iron maiden tee shirts or like

220
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,641
they had bang,

221
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:47,170
which is seen as Jewish.

222
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:49,270
So they cut your head off and shit.

223
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,130
And so that was the first thing
and it was so successful that.

224
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:56,380
And we love doing it
that we started saying,

225
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:57,200
well why don't we,

226
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,860
the whole.

227
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,251
Everyone's like,

228
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:01,350
what's your been your demo
and what's Your Business Plan?

229
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:01,731
And all this shit.

230
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:02,210
We're just like,

231
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,020
we have none.

232
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,580
All we do is stories that we like.

233
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:04,950
So if,

234
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,080
if,

235
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,000
if there's a story like general
butt naked in the Tupac army,

236
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,460
that's a fucking jaw dropper,

237
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,400
we're going to go shoot that,

238
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,150
you know?

239
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,950
And so we started shooting
it and people were like,

240
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:14,300
I've never heard anything like this.

241
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,134
What the fuck?

242
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,850
And so more and more and more
people started watching and,

243
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:18,690
and,

244
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,120
and we started doing it more and more.

245
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,230
You're a fucking human being.
