00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,690
It just doesn't seem like a huge product
gets everybody gets their phone ruined

3
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:08,100
by pouring a drink on it.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,250
Like that's the number one
reason phones get ruined.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,210
I would say cracked screens.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,840
Toilet.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,621
I will take cracked.

8
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:15,660
Screens are probably higher than water,

9
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,643
but they're both high.

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,630
Speaking of cracked screens,

11
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,650
cracked screens.

12
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,401
Almost universal.

13
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:20,750
Right.

14
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,320
Does everybody get a cracked screen?

15
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,250
I've never had one,

16
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,640
but I've had to move a Turd
to get my phone out of.

17
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,723
Out of the toilet.

18
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,450
Did you kill the phone or the phone?

19
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,260
Survive.

20
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,060
Survive.

21
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,310
How long was it in English?

22
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,290
It literally like I got up and then it
fell in the toilet and I was like God put

23
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,930
my hand through her and grabbed it,

24
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,560
pulled it out and then.

25
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,970
And then just write it off.

26
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,320
Put it in a bag of right now.

27
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:45,940
It didn't even wash his hands as far.

28
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,130
Now I did the shaky thing and
the good enough hairdryer.

29
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,030
Oh really?

30
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,720
What you should do if that happens
is 24 hours in a bag of rice.

31
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,430
Yeah,

32
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,870
it'll.

33
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,510
It'll pull away moisture.

34
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,830
What I usually end up just doing,

35
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,090
then having something stopped working
and then take it to the APP or call the

36
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:05,650
apple store and they will
send you one with that.

37
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,900
Apple's great with that.

38
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,460
Here's the weird thing though.

39
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:09,060
They put,

40
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,990
or at least they used to.

41
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:10,591
I don't know anymore.

42
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:12,990
I used to do some repairs on these things,

43
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:14,670
crack them open and get crazy like that,

44
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:18,030
but they used to put little litmus
paper in there that would show.

45
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,810
Got Wet.

46
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,680
It would turn red.

47
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,000
He used to be in the headphone Jack.

48
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:21,430
I don't know.

49
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,650
They probably still do it.

50
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,510
Still do it,

51
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,910
but that.

52
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,440
But if you call they don't.

53
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,190
There's no way from
their check when I say,

54
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:27,990
here's a question,

55
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,350
when you say if you drop
something in the toilet,

56
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,230
drop upon the children,

57
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,540
should you shut it off and
throw it in the bag of rice?

58
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:33,840
Oh,

59
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,150
should you leave time to turns itself off,

60
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,631
but it.

61
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:36,781
Yeah.

62
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:37,081
If you.

63
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:37,890
If it's still on,

64
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,220
turn it,

65
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,053
turn it off.

66
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:39,903
Shut it off.

67
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,860
So shut it off.

68
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,300
Throw it in the bag of rice.

69
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,110
Yeah.

70
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,570
What I usually do is just
suck the water out of it,

71
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,160
but,

72
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,760
but,

73
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,001
but,

74
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:49,700
but I wasn't going to do
it with the poop ones.

75
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,203
Why not?

76
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,870
Because when you suck it off,

77
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:55,800
if you look at your iphone,

78
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:57,960
like there's the top part where the.

79
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,420
That's where your ear usually goes,

80
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,010
but there's water that's in there.

81
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:05,010
So you stuck that and you're
like pretty much sucking earwax.

82
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,873
It's gross.

83
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,630
I never,

84
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,730
I never thought of talking on my phone.

85
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:09,890
Ever been to that.

86
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,780
You mean like I go really hard many times.

87
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:13,500
Have you done this?

88
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,610
Probably like five times.

89
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,830
So where's your fault when

90
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,480
you're going that you're getting earwax.

91
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,460
If you look,

92
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:20,941
if you look,

93
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:24,330
there's like a little grill that's right
there and if you look really close you

94
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:25,770
could actually see their shit in there.

95
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,020
I was thinking about the Jack itself,

96
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,150
but you have to suck all of them.

97
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,860
There's the bottom one that you suck.

98
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,000
You suck like power.

99
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,350
Does that work?

100
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,760
Can you really suck the water out?

101
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,510
Will really help.

102
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,320
That's what I'll always do.

103
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,490
You mean getting,

104
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,790
getting water away from it is
going to be a positive thing,

105
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,283
but

106
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,240
the guy on the phone,

107
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,380
customer service here,

108
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,883
listen,

109
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,960
I've been sucking on my phones that cool.

110
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,900
I'm just saying in the
most polite way possible.

111
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:55,770
I wouldn't recommend it.

112
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:56,060
No.

113
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,221
Well,

114
00:02:56,221 --> 00:03:00,020
and that's a problem because we
have capitalized and privatized the

115
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,050
education system to hear such a degree.

116
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,170
I mean if you.

117
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,810
If you got a degree in
Australia where rights,

118
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,350
Macquarie University or Sydney University
or University of New South Wales,

119
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,170
it's an Mba.

120
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:10,551
One of us.

121
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:13,750
Google's is exactly same as an mba
at any one of our schools here.

122
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,190
You know you had not only does an MBA
matter that all of a sudden and it has to

123
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,190
be from the right school,

124
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:23,980
so an Mba from Harvard or an Ivy
League school is trump's and mba from

125
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:27,910
university of San Diego or something like
that and that shouldn't be the way and

126
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:28,810
affect what that does.

127
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,220
It still keeps propelling that plutocracy
because there was a study done that at

128
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:35,560
least for every student at Harvard,

129
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,870
a student and have.

130
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:40,450
It has at least one parent earning
at least for $100,000 per year.

131
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,320
So we're still,

132
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:42,820
you know,

133
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,470
with the capitalization of everything.

134
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:44,781
We're,

135
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:46,330
we're forming a system where we have,

136
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:46,871
you know,

137
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:49,630
the very wealthy at the top and we have
everybody's struggling in the bottom

138
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,760
that the elite ism involved in education
is really fascinating to me today.

139
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:57,160
Especially because there's so
much access to information,

140
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,270
so many books,

141
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,320
so much online,

142
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:04,321
so much to read and just you can get so
much access to information that would,

143
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:04,961
you know,

144
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:05,860
a long time ago.

145
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,370
The difference between going to Harvard
and go into San Diego state was pretty

146
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,204
gigantic.

147
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,180
But what with what you
have access to today,

148
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:17,350
the average person has access to the
exact same information that they're

149
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:19,630
teaching at any school anywhere.

150
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,040
But I had a conversation with a friend
of mine and he was wrong about something

151
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,340
and I brought up this woman who had.

152
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,100
She had went to the
University of Mississippi,

153
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,250
but she went there and this was her major.

154
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,320
Like this thing that
we were talking about.

155
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,891
And he goes,

156
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:36,041
well,

157
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,240
this guy went to Yale.

158
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,550
But he didn't even go to jail for that.

159
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,980
He went to jail for
something else and he's 80.

160
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:42,551
Okay.

161
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:45,010
So he went to Yale and
like the 19 sixties,

162
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,410
who knows what the fuck they
were teaching back then.

163
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,090
Like what are you talking about man,

164
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,540
you know,

165
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:49,920
like,

166
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,600
but the eye,

167
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,750
his first initial reaction was,

168
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:52,961
look,

169
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,490
she went to the University of Mississippi,

170
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,620
he went to Yale.

171
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,200
I'm like,

172
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,351
oh,

173
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,490
that's hilarious.

174
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,740
But that is the way we
think in this country

175
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,411
it is.

176
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:02,120
And also not only is it the way we think,

177
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:02,850
but you know,

178
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,660
these kids that are going
to mit or harvard or Yale,

179
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,820
well it's the networks I take with them.

180
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:09,140
So when the jobs are about,

181
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:09,860
you know,

182
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,400
the only growth area that we have in
this country as a technology jokes.

183
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:17,570
But that's such an inshallah job
market where only the networks,

184
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:21,170
the alumni from these prestigious schools
get to really apply from all the kids

185
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,130
working at Google.

186
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,430
They all went to these fancy schools
that could be afforded by the wealthy

187
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:26,264
parents.

188
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,730
Collin quit a long time
ago reminded me many,

189
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:29,200
many years.

190
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,661
My first,

191
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:30,260
like on an opiod,

192
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:30,471
anthony,

193
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:33,230
I was dating a British girl
and she was a real pervert,

194
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:36,200
like I drove a Saturn back then I still
lived in Jersey and I used to fucking

195
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:39,110
park outside of Dangerfield
and she would blow me.

196
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:39,681
I would trap.

197
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:40,011
She liked,

198
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:42,980
been to trap her head under my
steering wheel and she would go like,

199
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:44,090
I want you to bite me,

200
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:45,170
I want you to bite me.

201
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:50,030
Like she would repeat this mantra
of me biting her on her back.

202
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,780
She liked to be bitten and brutalized
by her back and she was like,

203
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:55,040
I want you to make me suck it,

204
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,820
and then I would hold her head under
the wheel and she'll be trapped under my

205
00:05:58,821 --> 00:05:59,920
Saturday steering wheel

206
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,110
and fucking she would suck my dick
and lick my balls and whatever.

207
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,910
Good kid.

208
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,651
He was a good girl.

209
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:06,831
Yeah.

210
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:07,520
Her name is ruth.

211
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,750
She was a really cool girl.

212
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:09,170
Ruth.

213
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:09,411
Yeah.

214
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,820
Good five and talked to her in 15 years,

215
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:12,220
but she was a great guy.

216
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,063
Mr. Terribly.

217
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,830
I think you went back across the pond.

218
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,640
Hello?

219
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,430
As they say.

220
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,900
And what was the point of
the story of the Colon?

221
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,280
She was really loud when I ate her pussy.

222
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,560
Really super loud.

223
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,210
And it was,

224
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:25,970
she say,

225
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,470
I don't remember.

226
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,410
Just moaning and groaning.

227
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,530
One of those things.

228
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,463
Yeah,

229
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,153
yeah,

230
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,000
yeah.

231
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,530
Whatever it was.

232
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,363
I

233
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,930
beat my pussy like it's Manchester United,

234
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,130
but I can't.

235
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,790
It was a really low and puts
you a sloppy fucking wet.

236
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:50,690
Like it was legit.

237
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,950
Like I knew she wasn't putting on a
show because her pussy was sloppy,

238
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,370
but I was going to eat her
pussy on the air be a year.

239
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,320
This is before I was I get everyday and
be a good quality and your pussy on the

240
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:01,760
air and I was going to do that.

241
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,980
And Collin Quinn stopped me and he goes,

242
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,760
you know,

243
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,331
and he goes,

244
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:06,170
you can do that.

245
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:06,921
You could put them in.

246
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:07,521
You're a comic.

247
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:08,660
You got to say funny shit.

248
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,870
You don't want to be that
guy that does wacky things.

249
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,351
And I'm like,

250
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:13,460
I never forgot that.

251
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,181
He was almost telling me,

252
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:15,470
don't be a stunt boy.

253
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,420
You gotta say it funny.

254
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:22,400
You got to sit there and be funny verbally
and I maybe in that case he was right

255
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,181
because I wasn't the gun,

256
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:25,460
the Wacko who call up at
eight pussy on the air.

257
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,290
It's like I have to be able to
be funny in my delivery and say,

258
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,630
and I was like,

259
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,061
eh.

260
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:31,340
That was kind of a good point.

261
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,570
Looking back in hindsight,

262
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:34,970
I probably should have eaten or pussy
on the going to be a very funny clip.
