1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,460
The joe rogan experience.
Oh yeah.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,480
Forgot to tell you this.
What?

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,100
So when I was,
I was having some pretty good thoughts

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,940
on this acid watching some different
pants.

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,650
The killers by the way,
fucking killed it.

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,930
Hmm.
Um,

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,360
so I've tried,
you see stuff in like when you're out

8
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:18,800
there on second dog,
so truth,

9
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:21,500
I call them universal truths where you
just like,

10
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:22,580
yes,
that is real.

11
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,170
That is right.
100%.

12
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,170
And it's hard to bring that shit back
into this realm,

13
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,120
you know,
to understand it and trying to get us

14
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:33,800
kicked off youtube.
It's passing car.

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,870
So it's hard when you come back to be
like,

16
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,700
oh,
I saw the truth of something and then

17
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:39,230
it's like I,
and you can't express it.

18
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:40,640
And when people come back,
when they're around you,

19
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,020
they say something and you're like,
what?

20
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:43,850
And they're like,
they realized that get frustrated.

21
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:46,160
They're not saying it right.
And then it's slowly going away.

22
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,840
Yeah.
So when I was there in that place,

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,790
sometimes I try to remember like when
you get back say this to this person,

24
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,780
so that state told me to tell you the M
and m is one of the realest MCS.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,020
I'm not going to argue with it.
I don't know

26
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,530
what exactly
but it was like does that could be a

27
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:17,440
funny bit dude.
There's a funny bit in there like about

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,200
how like some things are just in the
moment.

29
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:24,010
They seem so profound and then I'd be
like,

30
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:27,450
what the fuck is wrong with me?
And My name was one of the real estate

31
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,990
MCS.
Why would agree with that?

32
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:29,861
Oh,
so he's very,

33
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:31,590
very real.
It seems fairly

34
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,240
brill and leary almost certainly played
a role,

35
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,830
but I think it's slightly ironic that
he's a journalist and didn't really go

36
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:42,680
that deep into the role that journalists
played in all of this,

37
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:44,110
which was humongous.
You know,

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,190
journalists are sculptors of public
opinion and it became the standard way

39
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:52,160
of reporting on any of these things to
say that they're bad,

40
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:56,360
to sensationalize it and to not have any
consideration for what that would do.

41
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,970
Because anytime a journalist writes him
scare story,

42
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,870
they can really mess with drug policy in
a serious way.

43
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:05,340
It might seem like nothing like,
oh,

44
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:09,930
there's a bunch of people in Brooklyn
and they overdosed on some obscure

45
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:13,890
synthetic cannabinoid amb food Bendeka
who cares about amb food?

46
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:17,040
Banika no big deal.
Say that it turns people into zombies

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,530
and if it gets thrown into schedule one,
who cares?

48
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,364
Not a big deal.

49
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,980
Well,
that's a very short sighted way of

50
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:25,710
thinking about all of this because
that's exactly what happened with

51
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:30,570
psychedelics and then we're not learning
from the mistakes of the past that just

52
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:33,630
because something,
it's fun to sensationalize and talk

53
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,790
about how dangerous it is at this
moment.

54
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,370
It doesn't mean that 10 years from now
we're going to recognize that it has

55
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:42,420
serious therapeutic potential and we
made a big mistake outlawing it.

56
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,260
And I think a lot of that also comes
from this sort of us versus them

57
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,710
mentality that people have where it's
cannabis is good.

58
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,930
Synthetic cannabinoids are bad.
Well,

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,380
synthetic cannabinoids don't have to be
bad for cannabis to be good.

60
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:59,070
Cannabis can be good without something
else being bad to counter balance.

61
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,080
You don't need to hate something to
justify your love of cannabis.

62
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,890
And this whole hatred of synthetic
cannabinoids I think is totally

63
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,360
misdirected because these are products
of prohibition that most people wouldn't

64
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:12,220
even want to use in the first place.

65
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,740
And when they do use them,
they don't know what they're taking.

66
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,420
They don't know what dose they're
consuming.

67
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,030
And so of course they're having bad
experiences that would happen with

68
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,730
almost any drug.
Caffeine included if people just

69
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,840
consumed enormous unmeasured doses
without having any idea what they were

70
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:28,600
getting into.
And so they're thrown into schedule one.

71
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,550
What happens if 30 years from now,
once the therapeutic potential of

72
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:36,220
cannabinoids is being really seriously
explored,

73
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,730
we find out that that Ambi [inaudible]
that everyone was saying turn homeless

74
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:44,560
people into zombies in Brooklyn in 2017
turns out to activate a certain subtype

75
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:48,310
of the CB one receptor that's especially
useful for Parkinson's disease or

76
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,100
something like that.
Then we're going to regret having done

77
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,900
that.
So I think people have to be very

78
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,060
careful.
Anytime you say anything negative about

79
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:56,110
a drug,
you have to be very,

80
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,840
very careful because the implications
can be enormous.

81
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,960
I think that the best stance and all of
this is to not speak ill of drug,

82
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,270
any drug.
The drugs have breakthrough drug

83
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:12,000
enthusiasm.
But also if you really think about the

84
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:17,001
fact that we are in a world where people
have to go to work to do a job,

85
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,120
that by the way,
man,

86
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,810
if there is a dude you need to get on
this podcast and there's a book that you

87
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:27,480
would love,
David Graber wrote this book called

88
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:30,990
Bullshit Jobs.
This guy is a fucking genius man.

89
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:35,100
And this book,
bullshit jobs breaks down the phenomena

90
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,310
of,
uh,

91
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,420
how many,
many people are working in jobs that

92
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:43,350
don't do anything for the world or the
company they're working for.

93
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,050
And it's not like this judgmental thing
where he's like,

94
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,700
yeah,
that's a bullshit job.

95
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:48,320
You're a blah,
blah,

96
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,350
blah.
He's one of the,

97
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,170
he's like an anthropologist.
So he's very precise.

98
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:56,730
But one of the qualifications for your
job to be a bullshit job is you know,

99
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,250
that it's really kind of a worthless
job.

100
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,850
It's not really doing anything.
And like the companies have gotten so

101
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:06,230
fucking big that uh,
they,

102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,170
they end up having like departments or
people running departments or extra

103
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:15,171
employees that don't really need to be
there at all and they have to pretend to

104
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,430
be to work.
That's what he writes about.

105
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,720
He writes it,
if you really want to torture a person,

106
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,560
uh,
not only give them like the job of like,

107
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,690
you know,
pouring a glass of water and an empty

108
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:34,350
glass and pouring it back,
but then add to it,

109
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,130
did they have to deceive their boss into
thinking that they're like doing an

110
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:44,950
important job or they lose their job.
So these not only are these,

111
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:49,780
like some corporations and companies
scanning your pis to see if you're

112
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:54,781
taking a substance that is allowing you
to connect with home what you actually

113
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:00,200
are.
They are demanding that you spend many

114
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,910
hours a day lying to them,
that you're doing work that you're not

115
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,744
doing.

116
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,280
Like,
if you're fucking efficient,

117
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,980
you know,
and this is another thing I graybar

118
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,700
writes about,
forgive me David Graver.

119
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:16,701
If in any way I'd misconstrue this,
I read your writings stoned,

120
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,750
but the,
and,

121
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,710
but the,
the,

122
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,110
um,
the,

123
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,210
the other fucking element to it that is
absolutely atrocious and fucking

124
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,780
horrible is that,
uh,

125
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,090
these substances are connecting is to
home.

126
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,680
They don't want us to be in those states
and they're asking us to fucking lie all

127
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,810
day.
And you know what psychedelic means?

128
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,170
The etymology of psychedelic.
No,

129
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,060
it means mind manifesting or sole
manifesting,

130
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,020
right?
So a psychedelic connects us potentially

131
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,480
with the truth,
what we are,

132
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:54,070
our identity,
right?

133
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,240
And these companies,
they're asking us to lie,

134
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,720
to be the opposite of our identities,
to wear weird a suit or,

135
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,890
or some kind of dress code.
And to sit in a desk where,

136
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:09,970
because you're efficient,
you get your job done in 45 minutes and

137
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,400
for the next six hours you got to sit
and

138
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,740
type in,
pretend that you're working.

139
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,580
It was an ongoing maneuver of mine.
We'd have these hippie writers come in

140
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:23,680
to take notes and I'd say,
yeah,

141
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:27,310
I played this fender stratocaster as I
hold up my Gibson Birdland,

142
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,380
which was known for,
and they'd write down,

143
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:34,020
he played in a Gibson a stratocaster.
There's no such thing as the gifts

144
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,410
reddick guest.
So I was having fun with dirt bag anti

145
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:40,840
journalists.
So now I'm invited to high times

146
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:45,841
magazine and I was hardcore anti-drug.
So I go in and this guy is and here's

147
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,190
typically,
uh,

148
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,020
so uh,
tell me about a GSI amboy Dukes,

149
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,720
what is it?
Like a band?

150
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,351
And I went,
yeah,

151
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:03,850
it's like a band.
So it's almost exactly like a band kind

152
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,080
of a question.
Is this,

153
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,420
how did this all started still draft
Sony?

154
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:12,130
How we started talking about when I'm
with the MC five and the stooges and we

155
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:13,480
would party and I go,
yeah man,

156
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:14,620
I was snorting something.

157
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,090
I don't know what it was,
man,

158
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:17,650
I just got higher than a kite.
And he goes,

159
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,990
wow,
you think I might've been a crystal

160
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:20,471
meth?
And I mean,

161
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:21,640
yeah,
that's what they called it.

162
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,940
I never snorted crystal meth and ups and
shit just went nuts.

163
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:27,310
And I,
we went into the war thing and I go,

164
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:28,780
I don't know anything about war.
I'm a,

165
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:31,630
I'm a guitar player.
But I went down from my draft physical

166
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:34,870
and when I went into the booth to give
my urine sample,

167
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:38,740
I made sure I ate Mexican food all week.
So instead of pissing in the Urine Cup,

168
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:41,740
I took a big dump in it was green and
went all over the place and the guy

169
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:43,600
went,
wow.

170
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,440
He really,
yeah,

171
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,960
really.
And so I made up the story for High

172
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,860
Times magazine,
you know,

173
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,360
the great magazine of good information
and uh,

174
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,750
embed.
It turned out that my drummer,

175
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:58,880
Kj night,
God bless him,

176
00:08:58,881 --> 00:08:59,181
he,
Jack,

177
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:03,120
she admitted this in and testified that
that's what he did.

178
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,250
We thought it was the funniest thing in
the world.

179
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:09,460
We're teenagers and this guy went into
the draft physical,

180
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:13,900
just an absolute near death,
lumpy shit to get out of the draft.

181
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,110
And we thought it was funnier and hell.
We weren't paying attention to important

182
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:19,060
things in life.
And so the,

183
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,240
the Ted Hating liberal press started
quoting the high times magazine and

184
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:30,790
quoting an ex girlfriend who claimed
that I adopted her,

185
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,670
did her,
I adopted my girlfriend.

186
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,740
If you read that one,
I did read that one.

187
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:39,650
I forgot about it.
So this kind of stuff,

188
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,710
I was like,
you adopted her so you could take her on

189
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:44,720
tour with Ya know,
so I could fucker,

190
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,490
that's what the story was.
But that's Ab.

191
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,780
Absolutely.
I don't think that's how it works.

192
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,730
That's not,
I don't think it makes it easier to talk

193
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:53,660
than once you adopt them.

194
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,830
I didn't adopt anybody.
I never shit my pants since I was eight

195
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,480
months old.
Um,

196
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,670
I've never been with an underage girl
since I was under age.

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,040
I'm not a racist.
And what else do they say?

198
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,720
Oh,
and they seem that they claimed that I

199
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:11,180
made Courtney love blow me when she was
12.

200
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,950
I think she claimed that I,
yeah,

201
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:16,070
I never met Courtney love.
You can tell I don't have a rash.

202
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,770
Um,
you just gotta be kidding me.

203
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:24,070
They just make this shit up because they
know I'm so good at bringing my basic

204
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:30,410
conservative agenda forward that they
have to go full,

205
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:35,411
solid Lynskey and lie and lie and lie.
And if you go to Wikipedia to find out

206
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:41,030
about Ted Nugent,
they will repeat these lies.

207
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,790
They're lies.
Every one of those things.

208
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,030
Every one of those things.
If I had done and I go,

209
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,390
yeah,
it was awesome,

210
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,680
but I didn't do any of those things.

211
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
Anyone can edit wikipedia,
you know that right in the balls.

212
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,700
Very strange that she might have edited
it yet.

213
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,000
So,
so I'm glad we got that.

214
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,820
Oh,
this thing is just persisted forever.

215
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,170
Obviously it stuck in your crop because
you wanted to bring it up,

216
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:02,000
but the very end,
it doesn't stick in my crotch.

217
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:04,220
Just,
it's a fascinating example of the

218
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:08,150
dishonesty and the anti journalism
agenda driven,

219
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,440
um,
anti American anti Ted Anti Second

220
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:15,630
Amendment,
anti freedom buffoonery the exist.

221
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,380
I think it makes for an interesting
podcast exchange.

222
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,090
I think so.
It's not in my craw.

223
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,520
It's not even in my universe,
but I notice it.

224
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,610
It's hysterical.
Yeah.
