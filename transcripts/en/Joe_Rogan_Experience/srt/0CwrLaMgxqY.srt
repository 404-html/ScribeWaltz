00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,680
Hello

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,040
Freak bitches.
Because I think the ability to

3
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:09,330
communicate and open debate is why we've
advanced to the point we're at in the

4
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:12,690
first place.
The suppressing of that is almost always

5
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:15,690
someone who has a bad idea and they're
trying to shelter.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,710
So when you see people that are chasing
after someone because they're trying to

7
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:24,000
communicate about something like you
were just doing it super d respectfully,

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,880
what,
when when you see that what you have is

9
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:30,720
a bunch of people that are trying to
defend a bad idea and defend it with

10
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:31,500
aggression,

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,161
you're right.
And,

12
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:35,100
and,
but if the more you kind of become a

13
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,160
mirror image of whatever,
whatever they're projecting,

14
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:42,510
you reinforce them in their position as
well as from doing other stories about

15
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:45,150
extreme religious beliefs like the
Westboro Baptist church.

16
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:49,380
I know from people who I met who were in
the church when I made my documentary

17
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:52,440
and then subsequently left that,
uh,

18
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:57,330
what short circuits their beliefs,
what allows them to see something bigger

19
00:00:57,331 --> 00:01:02,220
than what they're in is when you treat
them with kindness and instead of

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,430
shouting back at them or hurling abuse
back,

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,760
which just reinforces their view of you
as an enemy of God or suppressive or

22
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:13,710
however they characterize it,
if you actually behave decently and

23
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:18,660
attempt to robustly present your
position but in a respectful way and

24
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:23,400
with a kind of coming from a place of
caring and empathy as opposed to,

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,760
um,
so since soria so hostile attitude that

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,030
actually,
um,

27
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,490
it can be a much more effective.
Absolutely knows what it's being humane.

28
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,160
I saw this pregnant woman on the l train
in New York,

29
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,710
but she was one season.
One of those was she didn't,

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,490
she just looked like her stomach was
bigger.

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,400
It,
nothing else affect like perfect makeup,

32
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:53,820
just dressed nice in a nice dress.
She didn't have a wedding ring on.

33
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,930
I wanted to,
I just wanted to ask her if everything

34
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:00,860
was okay.
If she was with the dope,

35
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,330
like she was so beautiful at cab looking
at it.

36
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:06,500
I know she felt me looking at it.
I probably waited her out.

37
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:12,010
She was so beautiful.
I started picturing myself arguing with

38
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:13,960
the real thing.
Father,

39
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,130
five years from now,

40
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,870
Huh?

41
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,510
I started pitching myself on the train.

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,150
Holding hands are there.
I started pitching myself five years

43
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:30,320
from now at the yelling at this dude
outside the house in Jersey.

44
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,990
Hey Dude,
you had your chance.

45
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,230
Yeah.
You like your county uses a sperm donor.

46
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,690
You're looking at her beautiful real.
Dot.

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,620
I'm the real dad.
You calculating the potential for future

48
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,200
joy,
being with that person with perfect bone

49
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:47,450
structure,
you will let me to take a chance and put

50
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,660
your whole life into it.
How was this the errands?

51
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:51,500
Just like,
oh my God,

52
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,370
look at it was you okay?
Huh?

53
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,790
Hey Baby.
You okay?

54
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,270
That's what I was saying.
Okay.

55
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,030
Who He'd say I'm her here.
Go.

56
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,810
If I'm looking down,
I'm just shaking my head.

57
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:03,460
I'm just like,
every now and then I just go like this

58
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,940
one hands.
You want to try it?

59
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,280
Oh,
come on.

60
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:07,530
The train.
Hey,

61
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,500
it good though,
Dude.

62
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,334
I know,
I look good.

63
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,230
See,
this is the thing,

64
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,390
I wouldn't even if you go ahead and me
on a train,

65
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,820
on a train,
if I don't have anything organic,

66
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,620
I was,
I,

67
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,420
something crazy happened.
Oh Dude,

68
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:24,580
I'm not asking for real life.
This isn't law and order.

69
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,510
I know.
This is like,

70
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,440
come on.
All right.

71
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,940
Okay.
I'm the girl ready to go.

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,393
Okay.

73
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,630
Sorry.
I just accidentally put my face in your

74
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:38,631
pussy.
Oh,

75
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,570
who's baby is that in there?
Cause he in the baby's life.

76
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,360
Do you put your long life?
Hi,

77
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,850
I'm financially stable.
Not quite a Mosley,

78
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:49,950
but I'm getting there.
And on that note,

79
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:52,980
ladies and gentlemen,
this podcast is a wrap.

80
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,280
Yet I've got family members,
uh,

81
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,590
and again,
this is not my family of my wife or

82
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:01,470
kids,
but the family that I was born into that

83
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:06,210
have never apologized about anything
because they come from a cultural

84
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:09,660
landscape where to apologize to your
child,

85
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:13,290
to somebody younger is to lose face.
A parent is always right.

86
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,131
And,
I mean,

87
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:18,180
that might work when you're too,
but when you're both now adults,

88
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,670
I think you could sort of have to get
out of that and realize that we all make

89
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:22,440
mistakes and we all have to own up to
them.

90
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,080
We all have to apologize honestly,
when we make a mistake.

91
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,950
And yet some people it's super unhealthy
and it's unhealthy for the person who

92
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:31,800
doesn't admit they make the mistake too.
Because then it puts you in this

93
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:34,710
position of being in denial of what you
know to be the truth,

94
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,690
right?
You're going to run around pretending

95
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,690
that you were right all along when you
know in your head that you weren't

96
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:42,120
wrong.
So it diminishes your own personal

97
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,880
opinions about yourself.
Right?

98
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,960
I'm sorry you're not sorry.
Ready on,

99
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,220
on this exact point.
Okay.

100
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,680
So I'm having a chat with a family
member,

101
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,970
an older family member of my,
for my family as the problem person.

102
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,540
This is,
this is one of the key problem for

103
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,540
people in my family.
And,

104
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,410
uh,
he said something to the effect of,

105
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:01,981
Oh,
you know,

106
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:03,640
those ancient Greeks,
uh,

107
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,940
those Christians were really,
uh,

108
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,130
antisemetic where I come up with the
exact details.

109
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:08,911
I said,
oh,

110
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:09,530
well,
you know,

111
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,051
I'm,
I'm sorry,

112
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:11,310
I don't mean to correct you,
but,

113
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,220
uh,
those ancient Greeks were not Christian.

114
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,230
As a matter of fact,
the way we mark that,

115
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,700
as we say,
bce,

116
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:21,270
before common era or BC before Christ.
So by definition,

117
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,960
those guys were marked as not being
Christian.

118
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,550
So when he's now faced with sort of
historical evidence that suggests that

119
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:31,020
he was wrong.
What'd you think?

120
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:34,050
He does it?
It's so grotesque that I'm not even sure

121
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:36,650
you can guess what he did.
I don't want to guess.

122
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,430
So he basically says no,
that's right.

123
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,800
That's what I said.
I said that they weren't Christian.

124
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:44,010
You said that they were Christian,
so he looks at you in the face.

125
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:44,821
That's,
that's called,

126
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:46,740
if,
if you'd allow me saying on air,

127
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,230
that's mind fucking right.
Yeah.

128
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,790
He looks at you in the face.
He knows that,

129
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,340
you know,
but he has enough in Arabic.

130
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:54,180
You say what?
Huh?

131
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,270
It's the,
it's this kind of pathological pride.

132
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,100
Right.

133
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,220
Fuck you right.
I'm going to look at you.

134
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,820
Right.
So rather than saying,

135
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,140
Oh gee,
I didn't know that.

136
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:07,160
Thanks for correcting me.
He flips what our original points of

137
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,280
this agreements was
there.

138
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,620
You can talk to that dude.
You've got to cut that guy loose.

139
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,210
Well,
maybe I have,

140
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,273
oh,
maybe you have,

141
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,580
I like how you said that.
Long story short for listeners,

142
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,260
uh,
Joe was kind enough to,

143
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,980
I was interviewing Sam Harris for my
podcast and Sam was like,

144
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:27,650
we really should just do more than just
a one on one because ordinarily my

145
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,680
podcast is about as a panel of people,
a bunch of people sitting around and

146
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:34,010
talking about the news.
And so I texted Joe and I was like,

147
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,110
is there any chance of doing it at your
studio?

148
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,700
And being the gentleman that he is,
he was like,

149
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,320
sure,
just come on by and we'll just type it,

150
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,630
even though he had to show his
yesterday.

151
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,550
So after those shows,
late at night,

152
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:48,551
Sam Harris comes over
and Hannibal buress is still here.

153
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,520
So send me,
it was about to call an uber and I said,

154
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:53,820
why don't you stick around?
Yeah,

155
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,740
we were drunk.
We drink so much whiskey.

156
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,170
The best decision you ever made,
inviting him to stay.

157
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,660
So Hannibal buress and Sam Harris and
Joe Rogan and I have an interesting

158
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:07,520
episode of my podcast,
which will come up.

159
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:10,370
So if you're listening to this now or
watching this now,

160
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,910
subscribe to a way that people live.
Just switch for we the people space

161
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,920
live.
You need the live and then when it drops

162
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,060
you will,
you will see it.

163
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,820
It was dining epic,
our long argument between Hannibal Burr

164
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,570
a drunk Hannibal burress and Sam Harris
regarding a statistics.

165
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,570
We'll just leave it at that.
Yeah,

166
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,820
you don't want to give him more
statistics that may or may not involve

167
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,850
black lives matter and police shootings,
police shootings,

168
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,880
and just the reality of police violence
versus the perceived reality of police

169
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:41,930
violence.

170
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,260
So arguing about the statistics rather
than the emotional.

171
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,970
That's right.
Connection and the difference.

172
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:49,820
And I mean what was interesting is how
we have conversations about things that

173
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:50,690
are so touchy,
right?

174
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,610
I mean,
part of the reason why I want to talk to

175
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,990
Sam and you on my podcast is because I
think it's important for us to find ways

176
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:59,860
to have the sorts of conversations that
you have in that Sam has and that

177
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,990
hopefully I have where there's not a lot
of,

178
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,480
uh,
kind of opinionated bloviating it's more

179
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:07,040
about actually trying to understand each
other,

180
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,170
actually trying to take each other at
face value,

181
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,260
not sticking,
you know,

182
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,290
what a sword in the sand and saying
like,

183
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,190
I can't believe that you offended me.
Or you know,

184
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:19,190
having tripwires that if someone
transgressed as that or says a certain

185
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:20,380
thing,
then all of a sudden you're going to

186
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,430
crank up the outrage machine.

187
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,380
So much of that,
so much of that.

188
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:26,330
So I wanted to talk to Sam and knew
about what,

189
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:29,300
how do we have conversations that are,
that are more reasonable.

190
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,630
But of course
you don't necessarily have a

191
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:37,631
conversation that reasonable when you're
drunk and emotionally sensitive.

192
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:41,840
A drunk Hannibal burress and says that
he's smarter than Sam Harris and smarter

193
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:43,700
than I think anyone.
Didn't he say anyone?

194
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,920
Ah,
he debates that he was smarter than Sam

195
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,180
Harris.
I mean,

196
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,530
Annabelle's a smart guy.
He must be successful and he's,

197
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,280
he's a compelling and good comic.
Just not smart enough to know that he

198
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,840
shouldn't say smart Sam Harris.

199
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,370
He was drunk,
really drunk,

200
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,380
and we kept drinking too.
You hit it.

201
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:02,890
Well,
you hold it like,

202
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,950
well,
I bounced back quick.

203
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:05,850
I'm healthy.
Yeah.

204
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,110
So I stopped drinking also.
So what you're implying exactly what I

205
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:12,030
said.
You heard me and,

206
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,990
uh,
about an hour before the end of our

207
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:17,070
potty of me and Hannibal,
I realize I was drunk.

208
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:20,880
So I backed off and he didn't play out
that he was pouring himself.

209
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:23,550
Huh?
How like half a half a wine glass of

210
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,413
whiskey?
Yup.

211
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,590
Yup.
Yeah,

212
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,850
it was deep.
We went deep.

213
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,380
So,
uh,

214
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,000
he can't be held responsible folks.

215
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:39,470
Okay.
