1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,730
Drive by day Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,630
But you have a
responsibility of greatness.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,970
There's this very few people that
ever get to the position that you,

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:13,930
not just,

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,610
we're in when you won the title,

6
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:18,010
when you were the youngest ever UFC
heavyweight where light heavyweight

7
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:18,844
champion,

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:19,923
not just that,

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,730
the youngest ever UFC champion.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,580
Now,

11
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,920
not just that there's that,

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,400
there's also responsibility
that comes with potential.

13
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,480
It's not,

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,110
it's not just what,

15
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,780
what you've done and you know,

16
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,850
it's what you could've done.

17
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,030
Right.

18
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,310
You,

19
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,730
you fought Alexander Gustafson.

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,320
Be honest about that.

21
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:39,460
How much did you train for that fight?

22
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,913
I trained,

23
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:41,910
I trained for the fight,

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,600
but,

25
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,171
but I,

26
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:43,620
uh,

27
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,453
I definitely,

28
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,510
I had this thing where I
just felt invincible and,

29
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:49,330
uh,

30
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,030
did a lot of wild stuff
leading up to the fight.

31
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,470
I definitely didn't give it my all

32
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,030
as far as partying and sleeping.

33
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,873
Right.

34
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,000
Stay up all night.

35
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,073
Yeah.

36
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,310
Yeah.

37
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,030
I mean,

38
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,850
when you win a fight like
that where you weren't 100%,

39
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,980
does that sort of almost reinforced
this idea that you could do anything you

40
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:09,311
want?

41
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:09,821
And then man,

42
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:11,620
imagine if I trained next time,

43
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:12,281
if it's someone big,

44
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:12,860
I'll train.

45
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,693
Yeah.

46
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,641
So I have this,

47
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,480
I'm going to share something with,

48
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,790
I'm not sure if I've ever shared
this with anyone else before,

49
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,160
but I had this crazy
thing that I would do,

50
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,323
um,

51
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,270
where I would party one
week before every fight.

52
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,100
And I did it throughout my whole career.

53
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,473
And uh,

54
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,530
and this was stupid,

55
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,870
but it was this mental crutch that I had.

56
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,320
I literally would one week before every
flight I would go out and I will get

57
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:37,164
blacked out wasted.

58
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,180
And my logic was if this
guy were to beat me somehow,

59
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,340
um,

60
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:44,910
I had,

61
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,130
I can look myself in
the mirror and say that,

62
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:47,730
well,

63
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,340
I lost because I got hammered
the week before the fight.

64
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,940
So,

65
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,380
so it was a built in safety net.

66
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,280
It was a safety net.

67
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,521
Yeah,

68
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:57,354
exactly.

69
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,130
So I did it my whole career.

70
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:01,050
I would go out and get hammered when we,

71
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:01,800
before every fight.

72
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,360
Have you ever worked with
a sports psychologist?

73
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,110
No,

74
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,890
but now,

75
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,723
but now I don't.

76
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,463
My,

77
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,170
my open st proof.

78
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,380
I was the first fight
that I did not do that.

79
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,800
It was my

80
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,670
worst for apartments.

81
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,680
So I don't think it was
your worst performance.

82
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:20,100
I think you were very unjustly
criticized for that fight.

83
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:22,540
Cause I think over in St
Pru is a very tough guy.

84
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,640
He's a very difficult fired.

85
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:24,610
He's very strong.

86
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,290
He's got a brutal left kick.

87
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,341
He's athletic,

88
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:28,240
he moves well.

89
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,010
I believe it was a good performance,

90
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,330
but it was my worst performance.

91
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,230
See I think OVN St proves of really
tough guy and he was a tough fight.

92
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:36,580
And you hadn't fought in a long time.

93
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,620
You were off for how long?

94
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:39,161
How many months?

95
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:40,150
16 months or something,

96
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:40,720
Huh?

97
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,021
Yeah,

98
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:41,440
it was done.

99
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,273
It was over a year.

100
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,760
Yeah,

101
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,593
it was a long time.

102
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,553
Over a year.

103
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,240
You're fighting a guy who had been
pretty active and fought some good guys,

104
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:52,960
had a great victory of a Shogun and
looked real good and a lot of his fights.

105
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:53,890
And was an up and comer

106
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,900
main thing about events
that really bothered me.

107
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:56,880
It was um,

108
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,110
he was,

109
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,410
he was the most,

110
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,250
um,

111
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:00,971
well he was seizing.

112
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:01,121
Hey,

113
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,590
actually it has been
fighting longer than I have.

114
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,580
A lot of people don't realize that,

115
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,200
but he was just so,

116
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,053
um,

117
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,760
green and raw still like a skill wise,

118
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:10,421
skill wise.

119
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:10,951
Like I,

120
00:03:10,951 --> 00:03:11,500
I don't,

121
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,333
um,

122
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,700
I study everybody extensively and
then I come up with their patterns.

123
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,381
Um,

124
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:18,340
I've figured out the way they flinch.

125
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,500
I figured out their first favorite punch,

126
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,380
their second favorite punch,

127
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:21,940
that third,

128
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,290
their favorite combinations,

129
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,071
the way they're set up.

130
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,610
So they take downs when they clinch.

131
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:27,820
What side of the head is going
to be literally everything.

132
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,320
I know everything about every opponent,

133
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,580
what side they're going to shoot,

134
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:32,230
whether it's going to be a
head inside his head outside.

135
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,400
What am I going to do about that?

136
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,233
You know,

137
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,200
I figured out everything,

138
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:35,941
why they shoot,

139
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:36,141
where,

140
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:38,950
what area of the cage they
like to shoot everything.

141
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,120
Um,

142
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,170
and uh,

143
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,010
with all the same proof.

144
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,341
He,

145
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:42,641
he,

146
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,001
he,

147
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,260
he doesn't know what he's going to do.

148
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:45,460
He's so,

149
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,653
um,

150
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,261
I don't know,

151
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,580
Orthodox and Orthodox,

152
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,540
um,

153
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:49,950
you know,

154
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,290
he gets these random knock offs from these
weird angles and he's just wing stuff

155
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,060
and he almost closes his
eyes and next thing you know,

156
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:56,050
he's knocked somebody out,

157
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,770
you know.

158
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,130
So the scary thing about him
was he's so unpredictable,

159
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:00,670
uh,

160
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,270
and so,

161
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,500
and I had a lot on the line.

162
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:03,671
Um,

163
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:04,421
so I just said,

164
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,254
you know what,

165
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,340
this guy is a,

166
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,960
he's in a shell pretty
much the whole fight.

167
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:10,180
He was defensive the whole site and a,

168
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:12,040
and I just thought I
close through the fight,

169
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:12,610
um,

170
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,410
and not really risk anything,

171
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,280
which I felt like I let myself
down because I'm normally,

172
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,383
I would just,

173
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,340
I mean normally when you
get someone like that,

174
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:21,960
you just,

175
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,420
you know,

176
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,253
take them out.

177
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,130
You know,

178
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,431
you should,

179
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,690
I should have just been
able to take them out.

180
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:29,380
But I was content with a
winning and I think that was,

181
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,310
I think that was one of the first fights
where I actually just wanted to get the

182
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:33,910
win,

183
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,743
get my money,

184
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,830
go back to,

185
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,670
uh,

186
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,780
what are my actual goal,

187
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:38,620
which was DC.

188
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,370
Um,

189
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,010
instead of,

190
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,450
um,

191
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,740
wanting to finish this guy like normal.

192
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,870
So I had to really question my,

193
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,040
yeah,

194
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,730
I really questioned myself and why,

195
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:46,923
um,

196
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,790
why I was like that,

197
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,340
why I was consulting with closely.

198
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,140
Yeah.
