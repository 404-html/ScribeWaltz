1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,040
Even though it's early in the morning.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,360
I did the smart thing before this
podcast started and I'm muted my fucking

3
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:10,194
laptop.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,460
So yay.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,050
This episode of the Joe Rogan
experience is brought to you by hover.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,960
If you go to harvard.com
forward slash is it

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,760
Joe?

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,470
Yeah.

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,303
Is that what it is?

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,753
Why don't I know this?

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,473
Um,

12
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,483
early.

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:27,880
Yeah,

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,361
it's early,

15
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,010
but also I don't pay attention.

16
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,650
I would not calm forward slash Joe.

17
00:00:32,651 --> 00:00:34,420
We'll see if that comes up.

18
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,560
You know,

19
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,560
I think that that thing with getting dig
party in my mouth.com is destroying my

20
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:42,010
website.

21
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,510
Why is it just on your website?

22
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,010
How many people are going like,

23
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,510
what the Flexdek party in my mouth?

24
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,231
Well,

25
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:47,980
listen man,

26
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,620
they just need to deal
with it is what it is.

27
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,830
It's a dig party in my mind.

28
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:53,921
There was awesome.

29
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:54,100
What?

30
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,050
Ari's legs or something like that.

31
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,820
Or He's sexy legs.

32
00:00:57,821 --> 00:00:58,410
Dot.

33
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,110
Yeah.

34
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,943
What was that?

35
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,391
What else?

36
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:01,081
What else did we do?

37
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:01,170
Well,

38
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,250
there was one other one too.

39
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,383
Ari.

40
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,421
Ari Shaffir,

41
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:06,440
his legs.com and a,

42
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,110
what's that means like Jen
was trying to say is that we,

43
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:10,830
um,

44
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,930
hover.com forward slash
world and that's what it is.

45
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,070
You get 10% off.

46
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,120
We register websites like during
the commercial it's so easy to use.

47
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,290
Hover is so intuitive that we're register
websites during the commercial and

48
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:26,130
then forward them to our actual websites
but their websites like tick party in

49
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:27,660
your mouth.com you know,

50
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:32,520
and that's not smart to have that
point into your fucking we do business

51
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,980
especially if Uncle Sam
comes looking at Ya,

52
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,770
you know Uncle Sam's like what's
wrong with this freak bitch?

53
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,660
He's got Dick Party in your mouth.com
leading to is subversive website with cats

54
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:44,640
all over the place anyway,

55
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,130
however.com forward
slash Rogen place to go.

56
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,120
Super easy setup and they offer you free
stuff that a lot of people charge for.

57
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,890
Like who is domain name privacy?

58
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,910
Super easy to do.

59
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:56,460
I have personally used
it to register websites,

60
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,840
so go and check it out.

61
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:00,540

63
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,190
were also brought to you by Squarespace.

64
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,840
Squarespace is um,

65
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,230
uh,

66
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,150
one of our newer sponsors,

67
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:16,140
but it's something I'm really excited
about it because I just love what you can

68
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:16,770
do with it.

69
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,270
I love that someone,

70
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,300
anyone can make their own website and
you can do it just as easily as he could

71
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:22,320
set up a Facebook page.

72
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:22,551
It's,

73
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:27,551
it's awesome and you don't have to pay
to try it out so you can give it a shot.

74
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,280
It's like they're so confident,

75
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:29,700
they're like,

76
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,630
you don't have to pay for it.

77
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:31,464
It's come on,

78
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,303
sign up,

79
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,263
try it out.

80
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,450
And if you're looking to make
a website you will definitely,

81
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,800
definitely want to try this.

82
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:42,801
And you definitely not want to go
to cock in come mouth@hotmail.com

83
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,260
well it's gone anyway.

84
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:47,100
Now is it gone?

85
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,860
Wow.

86
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,980
I think Arisa fear actually highly gone.

87
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:53,700
I think they just got to rid of it and
Ari Shaffir it has that still has a

88
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:58,000
hotmail address and I've been telling
him seriously for like 10 years like

89
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,063
please stop,

90
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,340
you got to get off this thing.

91
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:01,061
They're going to close.

92
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,910
It isn't a Microsoft
don't they own hotmail?

93
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,060
Microsoft close anything
cause it's called hotmail.

94
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,170
They probably wouldn't really branded

95
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,400
I think hotmails Badass.

96
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,331
There's nothing wrong with it.

97
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:14,170
I liked an IRA.

98
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,490
That's a meme right there.

99
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,943
[inaudible]

100
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,780
I was a late abandoned or of all,

101
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:23,614
what can I say?

102
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,380
I think the way things are,

103
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:28,214
I'm good with it.

104
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:28,911
Hot meals.

105
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:29,840
Okay with me man.

106
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,200
Um,

107
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,491

108
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:35,660

Like it's super easy to set up a
store and just start selling shit.

111
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,820

a pretty dope website and
you can try it for free.

121

We got a lot of crazy shit there
that we sell besides a supplements.

122
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,690
We started to sell kettlebells,

123
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,340
we shipping to people.

124

129
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:40,640
Like if you want to have functional
strength like Dan Hardee,

130
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,370
you want to be that kind of savage.

131
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,570
I like this quote,

132
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,770
powerful Joe Rogan

133
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,630
label,

134
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,490
like a seal of approval.

135
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,743
Hilarious.

136
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,683
That's power.

137
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,120
That's sort of tongue in cheek cheek.

138
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,380
Um,

139
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,620
but it is that that will kick
your dick write in the dirt.

140
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,110
That is a brutal fucking workout.

141
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,880
Extreme kettlebell cardio workout.

142
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,901
He's got two of them.

143
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,201
This guy,

144
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:02,590
Keith,

145
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,423
Keith Weber.

146
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,810
I'm one of them.

147
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,590
Uh,

148
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,801
I've,

149
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:06,850
I haven't done a number two,

150
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:08,110
which is supposed to be more crazy,

151
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:09,040
but number one,

152
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,820
I can barely get through
with a 35 pound kettle bell.

153
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,770
It's fucking ferocious.

154
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,390
But 45 minutes in,

155
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,830
you're just ready to die.

156
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:18,341
You can't put,

157
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:20,110
cause this bitch gets to take breaks.

158
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,040
Okay.

159
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,731
He does it.

160
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:24,010
He films it and then cuts.

161
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:24,611
Okay.

162
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:28,060
But then the fucking video keeps
going and then he starts up off fresh.

163
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,830
Like the dude had a Gatorade,

164
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:31,090
got its foot massage.

165
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,220
Fuck you Keith Weber.

166
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:34,330
I know you ain't that fit,

167
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:34,930
bitch.

168
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,770
Nobody's at fit.

169
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,790
That shit's ridiculous.

170
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,880
Only joking around sir.

171
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,550
I think it Kettlebell TVDs amazing.

172
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,720
My point is,

173
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,480
um,

174
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,760
uh,

175
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,350
I've used it with a 35 pound
Kettlebell and it's fucking,

176
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,090
it's unbelievably tough.

177
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,953
It's great.

178
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,650
And uh,

179
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,350
it's a full body strength type of thing.

180
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,731
We also have,

181
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:54,891
uh,

182
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:55,160
the,

183
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,560
the new chimpanzee kettlebells,

184
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,380
it,

185
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:57,980
that everyone's

186
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,880
talking about.

187
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,501
Uh,

188
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:01,210
if you haven't seen him,

189
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:01,791
primal bells,

190
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,310
they're the first in a series of kettle
bells that were going to release that

191
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:05,690
are all art based.

192
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:06,021
It's all,

193
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:09,810
we hired an artist to
create some cool things on.

194
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:10,644
And kettlebells,

195
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,683
we actually,

196
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,500
you know,

197
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:12,701
the,

198
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:14,570
the idea behind it came from,

199
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:15,404
there's a,

200
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,570
another company on the
web called Demon Bells.

201
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:18,111
They have it.

202
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,590
And we were like,

203
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,280
Ooh,

204
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,410
like that you could draw on your weights.

205
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,130
Ooh,

206
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,341
you know,

207
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,300
you can create art.

208
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,180
And so we hired the special
effects designer and uh,

209
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,380
they made this and they made,

210
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:30,641
we've,

211
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,150
we've got some crazy ones coming up.

212
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:33,410
We've got to gorilla coming out.

213
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,990
She'd make an angry birds wind so we
could like throw them at each other.

214
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,400
Angry birds once we've got
a whole series of them.

215
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,031
I can't tell you,

216
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:42,260
I can't really say any pictures,

217
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:43,340
but they're going to look awesome.

218
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,061
Just like this.

219
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:46,640
Chimp does is chimp is
a scary looking fucker.

220
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,900
Um,

221
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,351
and uh,

222
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:48,680
anyway,

223
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,130
go to [inaudible] Dot Com oh and end it.

224
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,681
And again,

225
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:52,430
if you use a code,

226
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:52,830
Rogan,

227
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,890
you'll save 10% off
any of the supplements,

228
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,311
aren't you?

229
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:55,881
Freaks Dan.

230
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,560
Hardee's here.

231
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,393
Kirk,

232
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,921
don't tell.

233
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:01,280
Talk a shit underneath the commercial.

234
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,510
What are you doing son?

235
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,800
I iPads disabled.

236
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,090
I know you're tired.

237
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,140
Keep it together.

238
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,160
Your iPad went down,

239
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,710
your iPad is disabled for five minutes.

240
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:09,921
I'm like,

241
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,390
what the fuck it does this,

242
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:11,841
the government,

243
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:12,650
the downloading your,

244
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,490
your identity.

245
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,160
They saw Dick Party in my mouth.

246
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:16,994
Dot Com

247
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,403
experience

248
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,210
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

249
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,560
Awful.

250
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,900
Dan Hardee that's up buddy.

251
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,610
Thanks for coming by man.

252
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:34,690
I'm very excited to have this
conversation with you and uh,

253
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,770
the Internet has been a buzz,

254
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:37,620
you know?

255
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,150
Yeah,

256
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,520
it's been something misunderstood,

257
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:40,821
dude,

258
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:41,380
man.

259
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:41,720
You know.

260
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,170
Yeah,

261
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:42,860
I think so.

262
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,670
A lot of people,

263
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,030
uh,

264
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,940
especially seeing your
trash talking and you know,

265
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:50,300
hype it up like the GSP fight
and knock the fake Tan off you.

266
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,130
People would think that you're an asshole.

267
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:53,210
You're not an asshole at all.

268
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:53,840
You look,

269
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,280
you're a super chill guy.

270
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,610
Like I never,

271
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,060
I don't think I've ever been
around you and felt like,

272
00:07:59,061 --> 00:07:59,281
wow,

273
00:07:59,281 --> 00:07:59,901
that's sad hardy.

274
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:00,740
It's just too much.

275
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,910
I've got to get the fuck away from him.

276
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,250
He was like a really
easy to get along with.

277
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,360
You're a very friendly guy.

278
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,560
You just are really good at talking shit
when it comes down to fight time and

279
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,520
pissing people off.

280
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,730
And that really is something
that people have to understand.

281
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:14,001
You know,

282
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:19,001
like this is a pageantry involved in
promoting a fight and in fucking with

283
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,910
someone's head that you're
going to fight and it's,

284
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,570
it's,

285
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,560
people don't like it when other people
are better at that aspect of fighting.

286
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,161
You know,

287
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:28,971
they get mad.

288
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:32,120
People get mad if you could talk mad
shit about them if they're not good at

289
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:33,110
talking shit back.

290
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,011
Ah,

291
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:36,380
they go into the fight with
it like a deficit already.

292
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,683
It's kind of crazy.

293
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,140
It was the culture I was bull open though.

294
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:41,421
You know,

295
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,230
like,

296
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,063
like,

297
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:43,670
you know,

298
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,730
banter between teammates at rough
house is pretty much bullying.

299
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,360
I mean it gets pretty serious like to
where I'm sure some of the guys go home

300
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:51,440
and cry after the session,

301
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,780
you know?

302
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,710
So it's just kind of a
natural thing for me.

303
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:56,100
And then when somebody bites a little

304
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,330
bit to a comment that I made,

305
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,560
I can't help myself.

306
00:08:58,561 --> 00:08:59,394
It's too much fun.

307
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,743
That's,

308
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,190
it's very English.

309
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,640
It's very similar to Boston.

310
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:05,960
And that way Boston has that same like,

311
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,193
you know,

312
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,200
real and insulting style to the trash
talk within sports teams and athletes and

313
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,290
it's just part of the whole thing.

314
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,820
And some people don't like it.

315
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,410
And I could get that.

316
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:23,850
I get that there's some people want
that zen state Anderson Silva approach.

317
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:24,684
We just go in.

318
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,300
But people forget about
Anderson Silva in Abu Dhabi.

319
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,620
They forget when he was,

320
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,470
when he was fighting
with Damien Maia talking,

321
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,030
I'm calling them all kinds
of shit and Portuguese.

322
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,490
He was fucking with that dude's
head while he was lighting him up,

323
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,690
you know?

324
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,150
Yeah.

325
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,460
That's even crazy crap.

326
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:39,090
Trash talk.

327
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,940
The trash talk that goes on while
you're kicking someone's ass.

328
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,500
I remember watching him
fight and Lee Marie,

329
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,280
um,

330
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,640
I was,

331
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,210
I was at the side of the cage about
fine and the Tony Fryklund one.

332
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,290
Oh Dude,

333
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,190
you were there for that.

334
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,510
Oh my God.

335
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,930
People who haven't seen Anderson Silva
became Anderson Silva when he went to

336
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:59,220
Japan and when he went to England.

337
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,210
But England was really where
it all came together for him.

338
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:03,460
You know,

339
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,620
like Japan,

340
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,780
he got some good fights,

341
00:10:05,781 --> 00:10:06,780
but he had some losses.

342
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:08,340
You know the real tone in he flying.

343
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,174
He'll hook.

344
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:09,760
Yeah.

345
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,100
I mean he had some good fights.

346
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,030
Um,

347
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,190
who's that kid who was
calling him Alex de bling?

348
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,170
The kid was called himself
the Brazilian killer.

349
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,600
Remember they all got pissed off at him.

350
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,793
Anderson,

351
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,121
he beat him.

352
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:21,870
He caught him with a,

353
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,430
with a high kick and then
he knocked out Carlos Dude.

354
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:27,220
And that was probably what's most
spectacular fight over there.

355
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,210
But he fly in new ones.

356
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,900
Yeah.

357
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,140
And it was after Carlos
dominated them on the ground.

358
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:32,430
Carlos is very good,

359
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,930
very advanced at that time.

360
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,630
Like he had like the most
advanced ground game of,

361
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:40,550
of guys that were fighting and high
level and he had an Anderson Downhill

362
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
Mountain,

363
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,440
him and it did not look,

364
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,540
Eric Anderson was getting up.

365
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,200
Um,

366
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,630
but I think they gave him a yellow
card or something like that.

367
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,280
I Dunno how they got stood back up again.

368
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:48,180
I don't know what happened,

369
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,060
but they've got stuff back up again
and he hit him with a flying knee and

370
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:51,830
knocked him out.

371
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,740
And it was after that.

372
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,000
He like,

373
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,100
he got his footing with
a couple of good fights,

374
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:59,070
but it wasn't until he went to
England and font and cage rage.

375
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,740
That's when he became Anderson Silva.

376
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,970
It was so comfortable.

377
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,873
It was,

378
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,020
I really felt watching the limb or
fight that he could have stopped it.

379
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:07,890
And if any point,

380
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,181
you know,

381
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:09,770
you were ready to just kind of told,

382
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,561
treat him a little bit,

383
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:11,320
beaten him up.

384
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,180
He was tough.

385
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,040
He was beating the fuck out of Lima.

386
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,370
Yeah,

387
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,320
he was fucking his legs up man.

388
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,430
And you know,

389
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:19,290
and Maria is tough as shit.

390
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,730
He hung in there man,

391
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:21,610
the entire time.

392
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,060
38 times though.

393
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,210
So it was training.

394
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:27,270
Six weeks later he made a video about
him hitting the mid six weeks later,

395
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:27,610
if,

396
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,220
if people don't know
who we're talking about,

397
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:34,221
this guy is like really a
legitimate folk lore type character.

398
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,560
He's like Guy Ritchie movie character.

399
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:35,701
Yeah,

400
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:39,580
he and he's almost greater than a guy
Ritchie character because you wouldn't

401
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:44,581
ever believe a Guy Ritchie character
really could be like a top MMA fighter and

402
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:49,671
also one of the greatest armed robbery
suspects in the history of the universe

403
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,611
right now.

404
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:51,211
He's pretty crazy.

405
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,620
I remember sitting in traffic
on the way to cage rage.

406
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:53,860
I,

407
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,100
uh,

408
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,440
pulled daily in the car and uh,

409
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,880
like stuck in traffic but not far from
the arena and Lemuria just racing up the

410
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:01,740
hard shoulder and he's,

411
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,411
and he's a,

412
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:05,530
I think it was a BMW s
like 70 miles an hour.

413
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:06,364
Just,

414
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,840
he was crazy.

415
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,410
Did you see him following that with
Matt Lindland after that fight?

416
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,090
Uh,

417
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,990
Lindland for a cage rage and they brought
Marie into kind of hype up a fight

418
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:14,824
between the two.

419
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,180
Yeah.

420
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,260
[inaudible] your fucking mind key.

421
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:19,780
You're a lot like a fucking monkey.

422
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,520
There was Matt Lindland was just,

423
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,990
he didn't even think it was real.

424
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:23,590
It was,

425
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,423
it was pretty hilarious.

426
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,160
The more he's like throwing
stuff at him while he was real.

427
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,151
He just really,

428
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:28,961
was that crazy?

429
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:29,590
Yeah.

430
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,720
There's every now and then a
dude comes along like that.

431
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,410
Yeah.

432
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:32,890
You know,

433
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,250
we're lucky that he didn't
come along and like,

434
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,180
like the dark ages,

435
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,460
you know what I mean?

436
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,330
I mean he would have showed
the web people like him.

437
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,011
Fuck yeah,

438
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:46,011
there were that guy would have had like
the scariest gang ever back when there

439
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:47,250
was like very little rules.

440
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:48,600
You can have swords and shit.

441
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,220
Oh my goodness.

442
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:50,891
Yeah.

443
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:52,900
It'll run like a bunch
of outliers in a forest.

444
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,951
You got to think,

445
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:54,250
man,

446
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,950
that time in our lives in the,

447
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,150
for the human race,

448
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,490
that was only like a thousand years ago.

449
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,630
That's not that long ago,

450
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:02,250
man.

451
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,640
It's like medieval shit.

452
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,010
Long ago.

453
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,873
That's so,

454
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,840
so recent.

455
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,700
The DNA is still there,

456
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,730
public beheadings and every now and
then he gets some straight lineage type

457
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:15,220
shit.

458
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,220
You get a dude who just has basically
barbarian means and he's walking amongst

459
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:23,560
regular folks here in 2013 he just,

460
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,800
he's not playing by any rule.

461
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:27,220
She's got no rules.

462
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,250
He's just going for it
until he hits a wall,

463
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,500
just full clip until he hits a wall.

464
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,090
It's important to know that it's possible
that a guy like that could exist and

465
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:39,100
people get romantic about it and upset,

466
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,740
but you could not get
upset about it today.

467
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:42,461
You can got knocked,

468
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:43,630
get romantic about it till you could,

469
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:43,841
you know,

470
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:44,081
say,

471
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:44,231
Oh,

472
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:44,471
you know,

473
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:48,190
you're glorifying something that you're
glorifying something pathetic and it

474
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:48,311
would,

475
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:50,770
if this guy inspires other
kids to live that way,

476
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,210
okay.

477
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,460
But make no mistake about
it a hundred years from now,

478
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:55,540
it's going to be an awesome story.

479
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,051
Okay.

480
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,790
200 years ago when you're not connected.

481
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,150
Yeah.

482
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,750
From now,

483
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,460
like when we're not
connected to it emotionally.

484
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,340
It's going to be an awesome

485
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,970
story.

486
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,380
But we studied these people now though.

487
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:04,370
I mean look at like a,

488
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:05,010
you know,

489
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,420
like,

490
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,980
like Branson or a lot of folks
don't know that documentary.

491
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,300
The Bronson documentary.

492
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:12,111
It was really weird.

493
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:12,620
Yeah.

494
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,060
Chopper was really weird too.

495
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,410
But those are there,

496
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:17,200
those kinds of people like Lemur.

497
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:18,830
He's got to have a movie made about him.

498
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:19,531
Oh fuck.

499
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:20,250
Yeah.

500
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,083
Unquestionably.

501
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,560
And he could fucking fight,

502
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:22,890
man.

503
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,723
He could fight.

504
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,290
I saw him a fight.

505
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,610
Amir Renova rd starched him,

506
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:28,060
man.

507
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,910
It was so ruthless.

508
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,370
His right hand was fucking nasty.

509
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,870
He was really,

510
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:34,501
really sharp.

511
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:35,334
Stryker,

512
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,390
really powerful guy.

513
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:38,010
I mean he wasn't like
the most technical guy,

514
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,600
which is where Andy
should pick them apart.

515
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,380
You know.

516
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,790
He was such fast hands though.

517
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,400
He was very fast and very confident,

518
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,510
very confident.

519
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,240
You know it took a guy like
Anderson to sort of pick them apart.

520
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,300
A guy who just was clearly
Anderson's on some nothing.

521
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,830
He's not some next level
in like every department.

522
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,900
Yeah he's on some next
level physical shit.

523
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,940
He's up some next level mental shit.

524
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,190
He's on some next level
of confidence shit.

525
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,140
He's on some next level success shit.

526
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,910
He really feels like he's magic.

527
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:07,730
He feels like he can go in there and
just do shit to people but he can,

528
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,470
he can.

529
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,140
He does.

530
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,830
You're right.

531
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,240
So He's like that.

532
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:13,790
It takes a guy like that to do
that until a guy like Lee Marie,

533
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,770
you know a guy like when when you see
Anderson like at its best is one of the

534
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:22,100
weirdest things cause you can't
believe a guy can do what he just did.

535
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,120
You know,

536
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,120
like when he fucked up when we were there
in Brazil and he fought Stephan Bonner

537
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,593
dude,

538
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,501
that was like,

539
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:31,520
I was watching a movie.

540
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:32,100
Yeah.

541
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,020
It was like the guy just put his back
to the cage and let him tee off on them

542
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,580
and then brought him back in,

543
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:39,410
got to the center and
brought them right back in,

544
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,940
puts his hands down,

545
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,170
stands right in front of them,

546
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,270
and then when he decides to strike,

547
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:48,410
throws him to the ground and buries him
with one knee and you're like Jesus.

548
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,270
But it was like the Forrest
Griffin fight though.

549
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,500
He'd been baiting him to like,

550
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,790
like overextend on his punches
all the way through the round.

551
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,800
And then as soon as he did
it and crossed his feet,

552
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,020
he just seems surreal.

553
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,550
Yeah,

554
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,460
he's a master.

555
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,720
He's a real master.

556
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,270
It's kind of a kind of an honor
to be around witnessing it live.

557
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,104
Yeah.

558
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,411
Yeah,

559
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:06,981
I agree.

560
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:08,750
It's an honor to be able
to call it for short.

561
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,340
It's,

562
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,460
it's really shocking.

563
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,400
His abilities are very shocking,

564
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:13,971
but you know,

565
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:17,630
one day we're going to look back at him
and we're going to look at some new guy.

566
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,321
It just,

567
00:16:18,321 --> 00:16:21,410
the way people used to look at
Sugar Ray Robinson and Roy Jones Jr.

568
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,770
Yeah,

569
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:21,981
she,

570
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,270
Ray Robinson was amazing,

571
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,720
but I think Roy Jones Jr in his prime
would've lit them up with like a Christmas

572
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:27,110
tree.

573
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,150
I don't think he would have
even been able to fuck with him.

574
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:30,680
Like he wouldn't have
been able to find him.

575
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,630
But I look at Mayweather.

576
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah.

577
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,150
As much as I disliked the guy.

578
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,460
Beautiful boxer.

579
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,230
Beautiful Roy.

580
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,800
The problem with Roy was
all that John Ruiz fight.

581
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,950
He went up and wait in
one heavyweight fight.

582
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,120
That documentary was good though.

583
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:44,611
Did you watch it?

584
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:45,120
What is it?

585
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,820
The documentary I am writing for that.

586
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,391
Oh No,

587
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:47,580
no,

588
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,350
I didn't.

589
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:48,710
It was,

590
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,790
it was really interesting.

591
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,540
It got this little old white
dude doing all of these uh,

592
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,480
strength and conditioning.

593
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,260
Wow.

594
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,561
What was it?

595
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:55,490
Mackey shall stone.

596
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,391
Is that his name?

597
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:56,691
Mackey.

598
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:58,190
She'll stone is the guy.

599
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,680
Let me see if I can pull it up.

600
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,330
He's the guy who trained,

601
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,233
um,

602
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,280
he trained,

603
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:04,790
uh,

604
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,050
Spinks Michael Spinks for is
heavyweight fights with Larry Holmes.

605
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,090
And then again for Tyson I think.

606
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,113
Huh.

607
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,423
Yeah,

608
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,750
I remember watching a,

609
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,920
it was one of the,

610
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,900
one of the HBO shows tone at one of the
HBO shows with the Roy Jones prepare for

611
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:21,230
a fight.

612
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,630
And it was when I was training
the legends and there was this,

613
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:27,520
this shot where he was training to run
DMC and he's like doing any ShutterBox

614
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,610
into the rhythm of the music.

615
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:33,611
So I was immediately downloaded run DMC
and started doing it at the gym legend.

616
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,200
Oh yeah,

617
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,243
he,

618
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,521
yeah,

619
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:38,870
he worked with Roy Jones.

620
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,793
Yeah,

621
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,220
he was,

622
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,310
he was an interesting card.

623
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,050
Said well it's interesting because
what happened was then Roy,

624
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,300
he looks spectacular in the Ruiz fight,

625
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:51,050
but then he drops down to fight Antonio
Tarver his to lose a lot of ways.

626
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,390
Yeah.

627
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,070
Cause he's a 205 pound,

628
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,420
206 pound guy now.

629
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,010
I mean he was a small heavyweight,

630
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:57,360
but I think he's still,

631
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,740
he got above 200 pounds,

632
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,950
which to drop all the way the
fuck down to one 75 again,

633
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,360
that is a big deal.

634
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:03,870
It is.

635
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,110
It's way easier to talk your body and
to getting bigger than it is to talk to

636
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:08,510
you about and to getting smaller.

637
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:08,700
Yeah.

638
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,200
Like you have to fucking starve yourself,

639
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:13,740
especially in a sport like boxing where
you've got to continuously work for a

640
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:14,574
long period of time.

641
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,331
Yeah.

642
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:18,570
He looked completely different
in that fight physically.

643
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,340
Like his body looked deflated,

644
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,263
you know,

645
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,530
cutting weight like that.

646
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,000
It just ruined him.

647
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,330
And then he got knocked out by Tarver
and then he got knocked out again,

648
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:30,570
even scarier by Glenn Johnson and those,

649
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:31,381
those fights,

650
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:36,381
I think direct result of him weakening
himself to drop down to 175 pounds or a

651
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:43,491
direct result also of whatever the fuck
he took to get up to 200 plus pounds not

652
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:45,330
being in the system anymore.

653
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:46,980
And his system crashes,

654
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,780
which is what happens,

655
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:51,120
especially if you're like
in your late thirties yeah.

656
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:51,501
And you,

657
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:55,890
you're a pro athlete who's getting
head trauma on a regular basis?

658
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,430
Well those were all things designed
to lower your testosterone.

659
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,293
All of those things,

660
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:00,720
you know,

661
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,450
it's almost like nature has it set up
like you're going to get hit in the head

662
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:07,290
so many times for it just
start slow the fuck down bitch.

663
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,580
Jesus Christ like literally slows down
your testosterone from head trauma.

664
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:11,881
It's like,

665
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:11,991
look,

666
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:15,210
we got to figure out a way to stop
getting hit in the head and maybe this

667
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,230
asshole to add row
nature doesn't know that.

668
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:21,120
You've got to fucking fight
and career to think about.

669
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,560
Yeah,

670
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,350
I hated watching him fight cows.

671
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:24,960
Aggie.

672
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,300
Yeah.

673
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,740
Did you like how's that guy?

674
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:27,870
Either and they was just,

675
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,010
it was just rough to watch.

676
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,450
He's a shell of himself.

677
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,620
He's a shell of himself.

678
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,840
I don't think cows,

679
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:34,890
I could have hung with Roy
and when Roy was in his prime,

680
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,440
when Roy fought Vinny Pazienza,

681
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:42,030
it was the first fight ever recorded
where the opponent did not land a single

682
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:42,864
punch.

683
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,180
He went through a whole round boxing with
Vinny Pazienza when patsy Hans was in

684
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:48,960
its prime.

685
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,960
And pass the hands of swinging for
fucking fences and get nothing for a whole

686
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:54,924
round.

687
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,441
I mean,

688
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:56,430
that's insane.

689
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,010
You're,

690
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,260
you're in the both punch in and this guy
hits you 60 times and you hit him zero.

691
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,460
That's insane.

692
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,590
Should we should get Anderson
Silva to break that record,

693
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,870
like number of punches
based that around us.

694
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,290
Well you,

695
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,180
what you need with an Anderson Silva,

696
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,660
you're going to need a Roy Jones
type dude to beat Anderson Silva.

697
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,410
You're going to need a guy
who's got that kind of,

698
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,930
but with Moy Tai it,

699
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,870
those guys are out there.

700
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:19,081
Man,

701
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:19,914
they're out there.

702
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,210
They just got to put it together.

703
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,340
We all knew like you,

704
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,920
you came up doing martial arts
like a good portion of your life,

705
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:26,754
right?

706
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,460
So you must've went to like
karate tournament is a solid,

707
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,600
those few young kids that weren't super
talented where everybody was like God

708
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,180
damn,

709
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,850
but sometimes they never come to fruition.

710
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,061
You know,

711
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:39,360
they never become the martial arts
legends that they could have been.

712
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:42,600
In my experience without the people that
find it that easy and pick it up that

713
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:42,961
quickly.

714
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:44,760
Usually you usually lose interest.

715
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,920
It's kind of frustrating.

716
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:48,220
There's a very few that stick

717
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,670
with it and that's when you get someone
like Anderson Silva or John Jones.

718
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,050
Yeah.

719
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:58,050
There's those guys who have that lethal
combination of like dedication and that

720
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:01,510
freaks skill and freak bodies.

721
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,370
Man Do some freak shit.

722
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,413
Yeah.

723
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,470
There's certain dudes,

724
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:05,771
they're like,

725
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:07,780
John Jones can do some
freak shit to people,

726
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:08,561
you know,

727
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:09,400
like he can,

728
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,780
he's spitting elbows.

729
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:11,620
People in the head,

730
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:12,580
he's giant.

731
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:13,580
You can't get ahold of them.

732
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:15,520
He out wrestled [inaudible] though any,

733
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:16,354
I mean,

734
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,530
I can't imagine,

735
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,770
I can't imagine throwing any strike
home that wouldn't hit something sharp.

736
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,050
Doesn't mean it'd be like
kicking a bag of ranches.

737
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,913
Yeah.

738
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,500
He's fucking scary dude.

739
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,640
Scary right now.

740
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,950
He's on this next level,

741
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:33,100
scary shit right now where he's
just dis like so confident.

742
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:33,820
Just like the science,

743
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,481
the mall,

744
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:35,081
chill son.

745
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:35,950
And he's like 15

746
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,500
I think he just turned 24 25 okay.

747
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,561
Yeah.

748
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:41,920
Well,

749
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,870
it is a young man's game.

750
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,620
It is.

751
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,281
What is the,

752
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:48,340
this condition that pulled
you out of your next fight?

753
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,090
Um,

754
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,960
the wolf hot thing.

755
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,010
What is it called?

756
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,390
Like a baboon heart.

757
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:52,900
Yeah.

758
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,111
Yeah.

759
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:53,950
It's exactly the same.

760
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:54,230
Yeah.

761
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,063
Yeah.

762
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,590
What is,

763
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,041
what is,

764
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:57,760
uh,

765
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,593
what does it mean?

766
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,970
It's called Wolff
Parkinson White Syndrome.

767
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:03,970
But I didn't have the syndrome
because I've never had any symptoms.

768
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:05,110
I only have pattern,

769
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,270
which means that I ha I
have a second heartbeat,

770
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:09,370
but it's not never caused a problem.

771
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,540
You have a second heartbeat.

772
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:10,901
Yeah.

773
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:11,710
Well basically,

774
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:11,841
uh,

775
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:12,101
you know,

776
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:14,770
in the center of your heart you've got
like the regular pacemaker is a bunch of

777
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:17,960
skills that a bunch of cells that um,

778
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,530
you know,

779
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,290
they create electrical impulse to,

780
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,280
to keep the heart beating.

781
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,890
And with WPW people have,

782
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,120
uh,

783
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,300
other cells in the upper parts of
the hall that did the same thing.

784
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,430
And usually what they
would do is they go in,

785
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:31,300
it's called an ablation.

786
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:35,890
They kind of go into the femoral artery
and they can burn them out and stuff.

787
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,010
But that's,

788
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,530
but people will have that done when they,

789
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,700
when they have like symptoms,

790
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:39,881
you know,

791
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:43,180
when they have like palpitations
or dizziness and like
people have panic attacks

792
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:43,900
and stuff.

793
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,100
I've never had anything.

794
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,180
Nothing at all.

795
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,160
So what,

796
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:49,660
that's what they're
telling me at the moment.

797
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:49,811
I mean,

798
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:50,950
I've got to go back and get some,

799
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,590
uh,

800
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,190
some more tests done for like a second
opinion with a different person.

801
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,653
Um,

802
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,080
but basically what the,

803
00:22:57,081 --> 00:23:00,910
what the way I understand it right now
is if I want to continue fighting to get

804
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:01,271
cleared,

805
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:02,410
I have to have the ablation.

806
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,490
But because I've never had any
symptoms and I'm perfectly fine,

807
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:10,480
I don't see the point in letting
someone go in and start burning my shit.

808
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,520
And that doesn't sound,

809
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,970
that sounds like something they were
probably not going to do in five years.

810
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:16,901
They're going to go,

811
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:19,440
well back when we used to
go in there and burn it out,

812
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,720
we realized that's actually
a mistake that was actually,

813
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:23,200
you know,

814
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,980
the human body figured it
out and everything was cool
and running smooth and we

815
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:27,880
were being ridiculous.

816
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:28,300
Yeah.

817
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:28,541
I mean,

818
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,240
if it was causing that problem
and that's the solution,

819
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:32,021
then I would have it done.

820
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:32,580
But it's not.

821
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,370
So their concern is that if
they license you and this,

822
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:37,840
this is a potential issue,

823
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,590
a health issue,

824
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,070
while those,

825
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,080
there was that soccer
player a few years ago,

826
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,840
I think you play flight Chelsea or
something and he had a heart attack on the

827
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:44,501
pitch and died.

828
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:45,840
He was like 28.

829
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:46,910
Um,

830
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,230
I'm basically,

831
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:49,460
the problem is that the,

832
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,880
the main heart rate can only go
up to about 220 beats a minute.

833
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,920
But the secondary cells that produce a a,

834
00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:00,110
the second heart rate or the heartbeat
is that's limitless that can go to,

835
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,101
to whatever.

836
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:01,700
So,

837
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,300
you know,

838
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,750
like if I'm at 12 minutes into the
fight and I'm full of adrenaline and

839
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,870
completely exhausted and my
heart rate can't keep up,

840
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,510
there's a potential for the
other one to kind of take over,

841
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,030
you know,

842
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,970
and he'd give you a hard time.

843
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:14,610
Yeah.

844
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,020
But it,

845
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,381
but you know,

846
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:20,381
the chances decrease after 25 and the
chance of it happening is like 0.6%.

847
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:22,851
So,

848
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:23,340
you know.

849
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:23,540
Yeah.

850
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,970
Well do you also have like a
really low resting heart rate?

851
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:26,420
Yeah.

852
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,610
42 that's very,

853
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,640
it was when I got the tests.

854
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,640
Michael Bisping's is like 34.

855
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,210
Yeah.

856
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,043
That's insane.

857
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,551
That's incredible,

858
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:35,000
man.

859
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,020
It doesn't have to feed his brain.

860
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:36,854
They don't forget.

861
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:41,771
Oh No,

862
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,990
you didn't basically knows.

863
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:44,824
I'm kidding.

864
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,160
He might have like the lowest
rate working heart rate,

865
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,300
the resting heart rate
of anybody in the UFC.

866
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,393
Hmm.

867
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,713
Yeah.

868
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,430
That was pretty impressive work.

869
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,960
You only get that from work.

870
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,810
He's that Kinda guy that
he's always like switched on.

871
00:24:58,811 --> 00:24:59,231
You know what I mean?

872
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,880
So yeah.

873
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,621
That's a,

874
00:25:01,621 --> 00:25:03,060
that's a fit mother fucker.

875
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:03,570
Yeah.

876
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,403
Yeah.

877
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,640
It's very interesting what you said about
like natural talent and then the guys

878
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:09,474
with natural talent.

879
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,410
It's oftentimes they're the ones who
for whatever reason don't work as hard.

880
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,060
Well,

881
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,640
[inaudible] was,

882
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,930
the best thing was that guy
that had the talent and yeah,

883
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,440
he's,

884
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,490
he's just a natural fighter.

885
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:20,300
His whole family.

886
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,440
I just tough guys.

887
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,400
Um,

888
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,611
I mean,

889
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:25,000
I started training with Mike
before he'd even out of,

890
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,880
at his first fight.

891
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:26,960
Um,

892
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,970
and I was training with his coach and
his coach had actually invested money in

893
00:25:29,971 --> 00:25:33,170
like bringing him down to
Nottingham to train to like,

894
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,490
cause he was a DJ at the time.

895
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,190
I don't know whether most
people know this but you know,

896
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,280
Dj Mikey B

897
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,580
and um,

898
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:39,770
you know,

899
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,603
he was like in that,

900
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:40,911
you know,

901
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:41,200
the,

902
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,351
the,

903
00:25:41,351 --> 00:25:43,130
the dance and the rave scene and he was,

904
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:43,964
you know,

905
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,170
all that kind of stuff.

906
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:46,160
The glow sticks and shit.

907
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,533
Um,

908
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:47,961
yeah.

909
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:48,231
So,

910
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:49,300
so my instructor like,

911
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:54,100
like bought my car and brought him down
to Nottingham and like fed him and stuff

912
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:55,250
it with the intention of,

913
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,660
of making him an MMA star because he
had this natural ability and he is,

914
00:25:59,661 --> 00:25:59,861
he's a,

915
00:25:59,861 --> 00:26:00,860
he's just a tough guy.

916
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,590
He's a very tough guy.

917
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,190
You know,

918
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,300
he knocked the dude out,

919
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:05,260
he gets up and he's like,

920
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:06,094
I want a rematch.

921
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,031
Like immediately.

922
00:26:07,031 --> 00:26:07,864
Yeah,

923
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,610
it's pretty interesting.

924
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,530
I think he's,

925
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,680
that guy doesn't lose
any steam if he loses.

926
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,250
Like he's just goes back
to the drawing board,

927
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:16,180
dusts himself off,

928
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:18,640
heals up and has exactly the same style.

929
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:19,061
The next fight.

930
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:19,450
Yeah.

931
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,860
He's got a sprinkling of that Bob Barry.

932
00:26:20,861 --> 00:26:21,694
And then

933
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,220
there's a lot of that shit out there,

934
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:24,630
man.

935
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:24,970
Well,

936
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,260
I left barbarian blood.

937
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,393
It's out there.

938
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,421
So,

939
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:28,840
um,

940
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,770
what are you going to do now?

941
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:30,604
No.

942
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,640
Wow.

943
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,001
Uh,

944
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,610
I'm going to go back and get some,

945
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,580
some more tests done.

946
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:35,211
Lorenzo has,

947
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:35,410
uh,

948
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,640
a special cardiologist that
he wants me to go and see,

949
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:39,010
so I'm going to get that done and uh,

950
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,580
just kind of see what my options are.

951
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,420
I don't,

952
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,100
I don't see the point in
having a surgery done if I,

953
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,020
if I have to have it done
to carry on fighting.

954
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,670
It seems scary.

955
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,100
It just seems pointless to me.

956
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:49,831
Especially because,

957
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:50,220
you know,

958
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,180
like is it risky?

959
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,380
Well,

960
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,840
the problem is that they don't
know whereabouts in my heart it is.

961
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,081
Oh,

962
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:55,914
Jesus.

963
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,150
I think gotta go look,

964
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,021
I'll look for it.

965
00:26:58,021 --> 00:27:00,240
So they didn't say they could fix it
or they said they wanted to study it.

966
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:01,883
They want to study it.

967
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,620
I study and they wanted to study
this for weeks before the fight,

968
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,620
so they wanted me to go in and have uh,

969
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,090
something put up the inside archery at
both my legs and wanting to my neck so

970
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:13,380
they can go in and try and find it.

971
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,690
They put you under
while you're doing this.

972
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,533
Are you just chilling?

973
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,580
Oh fuck.

974
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:18,301
Is that Dan?

975
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:19,820
Hardee how's that possible?

976
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,720
You just lie in there.

977
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,590
So yeah,

978
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,910
that's just not cool.

979
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,270
Yeah,

980
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,320
that is so not cool.

981
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,070
So the guy was like,

982
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,191
oh,

983
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:27,600
so we'll do that and if we can find it,

984
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:29,430
we can fix it and then you'll be able to,

985
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:29,701
you know,

986
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:31,290
take a week off and then
go back to training.

987
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,580
Who the fuck?

988
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:38,180
You could just chill while they send
these like wire worms up your arteries or

989
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,590
peek inside your fucking heart.

990
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:44,880
My Dad said get that thing up his penis
hole when like when he turned a certain

991
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:45,181
age,

992
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:47,670
I think it's 60 in your penis.

993
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,280
Definitely.

994
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,113
Fuck that.

995
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,910
I had people tweeting me
and stuff and they're like,

996
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:54,960
uh,

997
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,320
you know,

998
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,730
my six year old had it done.

999
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:58,460
Stop being such a pussy and go home and

1000
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,043
we have more than one.

1001
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,850
There's people that just can't wait to
be country down and you got to feel sorry

1002
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:10,300
for them because I'm like a
magnet for the course you are.

1003
00:28:10,301 --> 00:28:11,460
You're a brash young man.

1004
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,710
He talked a lot of shit and people they,

1005
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:14,221
that's how they,

1006
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:15,760
one of the things that
people like about it,

1007
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:19,320
it generates interest and how much
hate jail Santa must get all day,

1008
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:20,154
every day,

1009
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,761
all day,

1010
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:22,830
every his Twitter must be a mess.

1011
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,360
But he's got the bank
accounts and match it though.

1012
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,263
Sorry.

1013
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,250
So that's what,

1014
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,300
that's the problem with me know.

1015
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:27,750
Yeah.

1016
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,880
He really talked himself
into some great situations.

1017
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,800
He's,

1018
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,540
he's the best shit talker ever.

1019
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,040
He's exciting to watch.

1020
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,320
I love like interviewing him in a way in,

1021
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:39,330
because I know he's going
to say some crazy shit.

1022
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:39,600
Yeah,

1023
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:39,870
that's,

1024
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,630
that's the kind of shit it's
going to go down in history,

1025
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,090
this thing.

1026
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:42,810
Yeah.

1027
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:46,380
I always remember one line and he said
when he was preparing for a Anderson,

1028
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm not sure which time it was,

1029
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:48,834
and he said,

1030
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,800
here's the champion,

1031
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:50,850
but I am the best.

1032
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,690
Yeah,

1033
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,590
that's a great line.

1034
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:53,801
I just,

1035
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:55,410
I want to use that
every day at some point.

1036
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,520
I mean,

1037
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,810
and he's so good.

1038
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:00,090
Even after he loses in insulin,

1039
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,590
another fight like that,

1040
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,560
just think about what happened to dude
got starched by Anderson Silva and then

1041
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:07,111
he says,

1042
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:07,944
you know what,

1043
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,860
Anderson Silva is only the beginning.

1044
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,510
I'm going to go after the
light heavyweight champion.

1045
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:14,130
And like all the sudden
he's fighting the light,

1046
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:14,964
every champion.

1047
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:15,810
I mean,

1048
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,680
he goes from losing a shot
at the middleweight belt
to fighting for the light

1049
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:20,514
heavyweight belt.

1050
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,151
And you know,

1051
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:21,984
that's impressive.

1052
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,241
Yeah,

1053
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:23,460
it was in Dana is like,

1054
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,660
he's the one who asked for that fight.

1055
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,600
Like I understand that he is a politician.

1056
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:28,530
Yeah,

1057
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,191
I understand that.

1058
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:30,360
He's the one that asked for that fight.

1059
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,501
But that's a,

1060
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:32,070
I mean,

1061
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,680
you got to respect the
guy's ability to sell shit.

1062
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,490
I mean,

1063
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,290
he can sell a fucking paper view,

1064
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:37,880
man.

1065
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,830
I mean the dude just lost to Anderson
Silva and there was white people all over

1066
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:42,310
the world

1067
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,690
convinced that he had a shot.

1068
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,360
Yeah.

1069
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,193
Yeah.

1070
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,290
There was white people all over the world.

1071
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,650
It was looking forward to him winning,

1072
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,120
you know,

1073
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,500
he started,

1074
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,333
what a character,

1075
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,213
what does,

1076
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,840
what a funny smart guy.

1077
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,290
He's the kind of guy that could knock
on your door at like 8:00 AM and you're

1078
00:29:59,291 --> 00:29:59,441
like,

1079
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:02,860
you wake up by battle all outside and
shit and then he's selling his time.

1080
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,030
Makes the door and you bought
three vacuum platelets.

1081
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,001
Yeah.

1082
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:07,810
No,

1083
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,040
but he can fight too,

1084
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:09,410
man.

1085
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,243
He can fight.

1086
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,740
It's just he's,

1087
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,190
he ran into to buzz saws to the,

1088
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:18,790
the greatest fighters of the generation
and Anderson and mean look what he did

1089
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,130
to Anderson the first fight that
you can't take that away from him.

1090
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:21,950
Even in Spanish.

1091
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,783
One was injured.

1092
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,460
That was an incredible performance.

1093
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,680
He was minutes away
from winning the title.

1094
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,200
He fucked up in that final round,

1095
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,020
but he was real close.

1096
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,870
Carries that with him though.

1097
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,700
Do you think that,

1098
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,160
well,

1099
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,480
it's hard to say he doesn't,

1100
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,171
it's harder to say.

1101
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:35,610
It doesn't.

1102
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,200
Then to say does to say he does.

1103
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:40,000
You can get all the evidence,

1104
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:42,210
the Polo Filio fi this fight.

1105
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,530
But the,

1106
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:44,740
Oh,

1107
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,730
the other thing is he's,

1108
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,261
first of all,

1109
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:51,250
he's just playing at a real high
level and this kind of shit happens.

1110
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,460
You read a real fucking high level and
if you look at how it happens in every

1111
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:57,850
other fight,

1112
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,340
it happened in a way that
sort of makes sense to him.

1113
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,220
Like Anderson Silva caught him with the
triangle that sort of makes sense to

1114
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:03,670
him.

1115
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,720
He missed that,

1116
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,910
that spinning back fist and he got caught.

1117
00:31:06,911 --> 00:31:07,744
That sort of makes sense.

1118
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,970
But the John John's fight
didn't make any sense.

1119
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:11,650
The Jon Jones fight was a mauling.

1120
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,600
John just took them down in Malden.

1121
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,020
And I think that was like the
most disappointing for him.

1122
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,750
Yeah.

1123
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,120
Cause he's a very good fighter man.

1124
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:20,500
If you look at the way he submitted Brian,

1125
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:21,334
Stan,

1126
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:21,641
you know,

1127
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:22,131
that's that,

1128
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,140
that's a scary dude.

1129
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,221
Chill son.

1130
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:24,850
It's a beast.

1131
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,683
Oh yeah.

1132
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,800
But those guys are just to step
better and that's what it is.

1133
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,180
It's just a step better.

1134
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,500
That's all they need to be.

1135
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,130
So,

1136
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,120
so what's your opinion on,

1137
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:34,380
uh,

1138
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,140
on,

1139
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,440
uh,

1140
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,420
fights is accusing each
other using steroids?

1141
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:39,520
Well,

1142
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,180
I think,

1143
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,660
um,

1144
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:40,990
we,

1145
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,990
we both know that in every sport in
the world where there's money involved,

1146
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:50,910
people are going to do everything
they can in order to be victorious.

1147
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,240
That is just the way it is.

1148
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,830
There are people who hold principal
higher than they hold money.

1149
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,840
And I know for a fact I had a long
conversation with John Fitch once about it

1150
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:02,710
and John Fitch,

1151
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,260
I guarantee you that guy
never used to anything ever.

1152
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:06,340
He's just,

1153
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,050
for him it was a principle issue.

1154
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,880
But that's not everybody.

1155
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,310
We,

1156
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,830
we both know it's not everybody.

1157
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:12,940
A lot of guys have used stuff.

1158
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:14,710
A lot of guys have used
stuff and they've said,

1159
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:14,921
well,

1160
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:15,101
you know,

1161
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:17,480
I'm just trying to get
over an injury and uh,

1162
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,990
of I'm just going to use it
to get over this knee injury.

1163
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,741
Yeah,

1164
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:21,520
that too,

1165
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,271
that you're doing that too.

1166
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:23,080
But also look,

1167
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,530
you get,

1168
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,780
you realize when you're around a certain,

1169
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:29,950
around a certain amount of like
really strong wrestler type dudes,

1170
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:30,221
you go,

1171
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:31,054
okay,

1172
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,860
there's nothing I can do
to keep this guy off me.

1173
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:34,750
I've got to get fucking stronger period.

1174
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,130
If I want to stay in this game,

1175
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:37,090
I got to get stronger.

1176
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,980
I don't know how the
fuck he got that strong,

1177
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:44,230
but I got to get stronger and it's really
hard to get stronger naturally quick.

1178
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,910
Naturally the shit takes a years.

1179
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,810
You know,

1180
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:52,810
it takes like four or five years to put
on a good 20 pounds of like real raw

1181
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:58,061
muscle or we can do it this way and
everybody's doing it and then you go,

1182
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,010
okay,

1183
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,000
if everybody's doing it,

1184
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:03,560
you know,

1185
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,240
people kind of kind of justify it to
themselves because of the people that are

1186
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:06,521
doing it.

1187
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:06,900
You know,

1188
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,450
it's like everybody enables each other.

1189
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:09,591
Yeah.

1190
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:10,280
I don't think,

1191
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:10,740
um,

1192
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,660
I think,

1193
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,230
uh,

1194
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,711
there's a,

1195
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:17,020
certainly an issue and there's certainly
a discussion to be had and especially

1196
00:33:17,021 --> 00:33:17,230
in,

1197
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:21,080
in for testosterone replacement therapy,

1198
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,070
that's a big one.

1199
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,320
That to me is a big one because that
one for a lot of folks that don't know,

1200
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:32,180
like young fighters in their early
thirties even even some guys younger than

1201
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:32,810
that,

1202
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,200
uh,

1203
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,640
take testosterone,

1204
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,590
which is really kind of crazy.

1205
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:36,921
Like your,

1206
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:41,070
your body should be producing
testosterone in healthy quality quantity.

1207
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,960
It's like deep,

1208
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:43,130
deep into your thirties.

1209
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,590
It starts to drop off when
he started hitting 40,

1210
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,140
if you're like a very slowly,

1211
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,610
very small numbers.

1212
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,060
Yes.

1213
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,631
And if you're,

1214
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:52,250
if you're fit and if you're,

1215
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:54,310
you're eating healthy
and if you know you're,

1216
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:55,400
you sleeping right,

1217
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,630
you should be okay.

1218
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,420
So when you find guys that are like 30,

1219
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,650
and they're taking testosterone
replacement therapy,

1220
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:02,030
it will,

1221
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,301
okay,

1222
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,170
what are you doing?

1223
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:04,910
What are you doing right now?

1224
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:07,670
Is you're putting testosterone
into your body that doesn't exist.

1225
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,850
So does it not exist because
you've been hit too many times,

1226
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,580
which we both know was
also a real possibility.

1227
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,631
In fact a,

1228
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:15,081
this guy,

1229
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:18,200
Dr. Mark Gordon who
worked with James Tony's,

1230
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,020
he's done a lot of work on that,

1231
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,680
showing how traumatic brain injury to
both soldiers and people who do extreme

1232
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:28,664
sports,

1233
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,580
that traumatic brain injury has
a significant impact on your,

1234
00:34:32,581 --> 00:34:34,450
your body's ability to
produce testosterone.

1235
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,660
So I could knock the
testosterone out of somebody's,

1236
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,620
well I don't like little girl
[inaudible] is picking that line up.

1237
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:42,970
It's not,

1238
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:44,430
it's not a situation where,

1239
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,240
where it happens in one,

1240
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,110
one night.

1241
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,990
It's a situation where
you're beating yourself up.

1242
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:50,861
You know,

1243
00:34:50,861 --> 00:34:53,350
if I've never fought in MMA fight,

1244
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,570
but I've watched you guys
trained and you know,

1245
00:34:55,571 --> 00:34:56,830
I see the,

1246
00:34:56,831 --> 00:35:01,831
the amount of hours that it takes in a
day to do a real proper six week camp.

1247
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,630
And for folks who don't know,

1248
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,800
it's insane.

1249
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,131
It's insane.

1250
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:07,340
It's,

1251
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,590
it's fucking madness.

1252
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,280
And I think some guys think the only way
they can get through that is with some

1253
00:35:12,281 --> 00:35:15,220
help because if you
don't get through that,

1254
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,550
then what are you going to do when
you get in there with a guy like GSP,

1255
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,500
when you know he has gone
through that and like,

1256
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:21,820
well fuck you know,

1257
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,151
you're,

1258
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:22,984
you're doomed.

1259
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,670
You're going to keep up
with them for a little bit,

1260
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,350
but eventually he's
going to steamroll you.

1261
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,323
Yeah.

1262
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,660
There's just no getting around it.

1263
00:35:28,661 --> 00:35:30,460
If you don't do what
everybody else is doing,

1264
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,870
how can you compete?

1265
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,551
Unless I dry,

1266
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:33,640
it dries like an alien.

1267
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:35,730
Oh,

1268
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,220
what's,

1269
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,053
yeah.

1270
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,010
The thing

1271
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,843
about aliens.

1272
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,803
Terrified of aliens.

1273
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,170
Yeah.

1274
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,200
If he hates fighting dudes
with Alienware on their trunk,

1275
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,080
what if it was Kelly and
where the whole time,

1276
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,910
just a big marketing,

1277
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,780
getting hired by Alienware
spots with a lot of fighters.

1278
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,130
You know,

1279
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,400
maybe TSP has a deal.

1280
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,880
They can't have them wear
that thing on their pants.

1281
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,040
They wear that thing to scare me.

1282
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,421
No,

1283
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:01,254
no.

1284
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,420
Have you rewatched that?

1285
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,021
Rewatch it.

1286
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:05,310
It's so interesting.

1287
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,631
It's amazing.

1288
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,464
He's awesome.

1289
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,340
I love that guy.

1290
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,503
He's awesome.

1291
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,920
That was a beautiful interview,

1292
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:11,680
man.

1293
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,630
It really was.

1294
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,100
He's a guy who,

1295
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:14,580
uh,

1296
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,210
he's,

1297
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,990
he's kept his humility better
than any champion I've ever seen.

1298
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,500
Yeah.

1299
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,280
It's amazing.

1300
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,920
I've been up to Montreal a couple
of times to work with them and uh,

1301
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,310
well the first time I went up there I
didn't know how they were going to receive

1302
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:27,360
me know because obviously,

1303
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,230
you know,

1304
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:33,230
I did say a few things about this camp
during the preparation and fake 10 line

1305
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,690
was fucking outstanding.

1306
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,530
Thank you.

1307
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,363
Um,

1308
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:38,611
yeah.

1309
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:39,300
So I,

1310
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,090
they asked me to go out for a week to
spar with him and I thought they were just

1311
00:36:42,091 --> 00:36:42,690
going to take me into,

1312
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,800
to kind of beat me up a little bit,

1313
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,873
throw me out.

1314
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,560
But I was up for it anyway.

1315
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:49,320
It was going to be an experience and when
I got there everyone was really cool.

1316
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:49,741
I felt,

1317
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:49,941
you know,

1318
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:50,774
I was like,

1319
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,913
yeah,

1320
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,201
ready.

1321
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:52,470
Cool.

1322
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,920
And GSP is by far the most
humble and deserve it champion.

1323
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:56,800
Other than that,

1324
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,710
there's no,

1325
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,590
no one liked him when it
comes to like MMA champions.

1326
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:02,460
He's such a,

1327
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,990
he's a sweet guy.

1328
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:06,930
Like real nice to Pete and
he handles it really well,

1329
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,161
his lifestyle,

1330
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:09,090
because obviously it's,

1331
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,500
he gets a lot of attention all the
time and it's exhausting and he still,

1332
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,750
no matter how much attention he goes,

1333
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,630
he's still the same guy.

1334
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,081
It's not,

1335
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:17,580
he doesn't fall into it.

1336
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:18,500
You know,

1337
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,000
that's,

1338
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,990
that's a real issue with
folks fall into that,

1339
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,710
you know,

1340
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,610
they get caught up.

1341
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,790
It was kind of funny going up there the
first time because I still had a Mohawk

1342
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:29,940
the first time and like he
goes out like most nights,

1343
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:31,950
he like loves to be
out in clubs and stuff.

1344
00:37:31,951 --> 00:37:33,660
He doesn't drink and any of that.

1345
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,890
But obviously you can imagine how
much attention he gets him Montreal.

1346
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:40,710
And so he's walking through the club
and everybody would like looks over him

1347
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,220
staring at him and then they notice me
behind him and they're like the look of

1348
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,240
confusion on their face.

1349
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,980
Like we got hoodwinked
motherfuckers like each other.

1350
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:53,791
That's funny,

1351
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:54,360
man.

1352
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,193
That's funny.

1353
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,041
Yeah.

1354
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,100
You know when all trickled down from
the top that for Rasa hobby guy.

1355
00:37:59,150 --> 00:37:59,560
Yeah,

1356
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,331
that's smart dude.

1357
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:00,990
He is.

1358
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,741
It's a very,

1359
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:02,640
very smart dude.

1360
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,563
Very clever.

1361
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,080
The way he runs his show is no bullshit,

1362
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,680
you know,

1363
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,610
and John Danaher's,

1364
00:38:08,611 --> 00:38:09,444
well,

1365
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,730
people don't talk about this guy right
in the hotel that I was staying at.

1366
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,820
My Room was opposite his.

1367
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:16,980
So like he was the last
person I'd see before,

1368
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:17,700
like before,

1369
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,690
like heading to bed at night.

1370
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:21,780
And we stood in that long conversations
in the corridor and the guy's

1371
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:23,220
fascinating and really,

1372
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:24,180
really strange,

1373
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:24,541
really,

1374
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:25,410
really strange and really,

1375
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:26,244
really fascinating.

1376
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:26,800
Um,

1377
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,421
I went to,

1378
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:28,380
we went to dinner with him,

1379
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:28,621
me,

1380
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:29,640
him in any bravo,

1381
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,000
uh,

1382
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,800
like a Denny's or some shit like that.

1383
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:34,050
I then we just broke down
the universe together.

1384
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,250
John Danaher is a beast.

1385
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:36,830
He's amazing.

1386
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,241
So,

1387
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:38,470
so fucking smart.

1388
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,010
Yeah.

1389
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,221
Yeah.

1390
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:40,690
And that's actually how I went.

1391
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,990
That's how I wound up doing
the taekwondo with George.

1392
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,710
Okay.

1393
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,900
And teaching them how to throw
the attorney side kick correctly.

1394
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,280
It's from John Donahoe.

1395
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:52,510
Like Donna her was asking me if I
knew any high level taekwondo guys,

1396
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:55,300
they can teach George the proper
mechanics of the spinning back kick.

1397
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,850
And I felt like such
an asshole saying like,

1398
00:38:57,851 --> 00:38:58,151
yeah,

1399
00:38:58,151 --> 00:38:59,290
I can judge it.

1400
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,323
Right.

1401
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:00,941
You know,

1402
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,760
it sounds like such a
Hollywood douche move.

1403
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:04,060
Like,

1404
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,511
Oh yeah,

1405
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:08,350
you know you're going to teach George
fucking Saint Pierre how to throw a kick.

1406
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,431
But to his credit,

1407
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:12,280
he actually listened to me like
I couldn't believe he tried it.

1408
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,120
You know,

1409
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,260
because I wouldn't have listened to me.

1410
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,041
I be like,

1411
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:15,221
yeah,

1412
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:15,640
bitch.

1413
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,473
All right,

1414
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,890
I'll go watch you kick a bag,

1415
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,393
fruitcake,

1416
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,860
what can act or Weirdo.

1417
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:28,390
But George was like super like
humble and eager to learn.

1418
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,390
He's a really unusual dude.

1419
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,430
It's weird how many different,

1420
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:38,630
like the way people perceive like MMA
fighters or even Jujitsu athletes are

1421
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:42,550
kickboxers the way people perceive,

1422
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:47,290
like people who compete in combat
sports and the way they really are.

1423
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:48,310
It's so different.

1424
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,140
Like my favorite people,

1425
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:53,770
some of my favorite people of all time
that I've ever met have been fighters

1426
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,160
because there's something about the type
of character that you need to have to

1427
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:03,460
be able to test yourself in
such an extreme environment.

1428
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:05,560
Like that's a rare quality.

1429
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,820
It's a very real quality.

1430
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:11,821
And there's some people miss mistake it
with being a barbaric thing cause they,

1431
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,920
they think that somehow or another we
should not be violent because violence is

1432
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:18,754
bad.

1433
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:23,440
And even though it's a competition and
they both agree to do it and they can be

1434
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:23,981
respectful,

1435
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:26,710
it's still seems like it's anti societal.

1436
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,593
Yeah.

1437
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,530
But they don't understand they did this.

1438
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,070
They just haven't experienced anything
like really intense themselves.

1439
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:33,261
And,

1440
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:36,880
and knowing that there's only one way
to develop like real character and have

1441
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:38,080
confidence in that real character,

1442
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:39,370
you've got to put yourself in fire.

1443
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:39,920
Yeah.

1444
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,120
And,

1445
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,761
and that's why it,

1446
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:42,320
that's why a lot of them may fight as a,

1447
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,680
of our interest in people.

1448
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:44,490
But yes,

1449
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:44,761
I mean,

1450
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:45,150
you know,

1451
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,600
after a certain amount of time of being
in the gym and being so focused on

1452
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:49,140
yourself,

1453
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,310
you become very self aware and,

1454
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,170
and then,

1455
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:52,480
you know,

1456
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,820
usually from that becomes a
lot of self confidence and,

1457
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:55,081
and,

1458
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:55,650
you know,

1459
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,060
just being very comfortable in,

1460
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,350
in different environments,

1461
00:40:58,351 --> 00:41:00,250
which usually means you
stand out because you,

1462
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:00,910
you know,

1463
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,260
you,

1464
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,480
you kind of put that out there when you,

1465
00:41:02,481 --> 00:41:03,480
when you walk into a room.

1466
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,850
Um,

1467
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:07,190
and you're not worried about
physical confrontation,

1468
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,560
but you will sit and feel like
you have anything to prove.

1469
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:10,394
Exactly.

1470
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,310
And that's the real issue with a lot of
guys is the need to prove dominance and

1471
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:15,200
need to prove.

1472
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:18,320
But guys who have had
martial arts backgrounds,

1473
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:19,430
they don't have that need.

1474
00:41:19,431 --> 00:41:20,450
They can chill.

1475
00:41:20,451 --> 00:41:21,740
They can relax their way.

1476
00:41:21,741 --> 00:41:23,000
Easier to be around.

1477
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,480
Yeah.

1478
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,830
Like I've never seen shit start up
between like maybe Brazilian dudes have.

1479
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,810
Maybe some Brazilian dudes
have jumped each other.

1480
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,600
I was watching a video
and Vandelay Silva was in,

1481
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:34,590
it was two fighting in
the dressing room in La.

1482
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,730
[inaudible] silver and
Charles Crazy Horse Bryant.

1483
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,301
No,

1484
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:38,571
no,

1485
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:38,751
no.

1486
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:38,991
It was,

1487
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:40,360
it was two of the guys in like Vander,

1488
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:41,420
they was culinary and one of them.

1489
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,171
Oh yeah,

1490
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:44,690
that was Cristiana
Marcello and in a triangle.

1491
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:44,961
Yeah,

1492
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,250
he got them a try and
I'll put them to sleep.

1493
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,181
And that was,

1494
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:48,470
but it was Charles Crazy horse.

1495
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:51,050
Brian and crazy horse actually got up.

1496
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:54,740
The legend is and sucker punched
Vandelay and knocked him out cold.

1497
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,300
And it was right before Vandelay was
supposed to fight Ricardo Arona and

1498
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:01,250
Vandelay literally got knocked out,

1499
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,260
got woke up and that sent out to this
is if you're going to believe Charles

1500
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,530
Crazy Yours Brian,

1501
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,170
which I wonder if he's
telling the truth man,

1502
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:13,910
cause you crazy horse was nuts and
he could knock a motherfucker out.

1503
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,220
He had a serious punch.

1504
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:21,370
Crazy horse could punch fucking hard
enough to easily knock on 185 pounds if he

1505
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:23,241
sucker punched him.

1506
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:26,120
Did you ever see that fight where he
told that stuffed bear apart in the

1507
00:42:26,121 --> 00:42:26,954
columns?

1508
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:33,320
Well he would get to the top of the cage
and do back flips off the top of the

1509
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:33,621
cage.

1510
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:34,850
He was like the first dude doing that.

1511
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:35,871
Sit on the top.

1512
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:36,720
Sit on the uh,

1513
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,650
the colon or post.

1514
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:37,860
Yeah,

1515
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,160
just jump up and sit up
there during the fight.

1516
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,600
He would sucker punch guys like in the
middle of around just wham and that in

1517
00:42:45,601 --> 00:42:46,570
and just knock them out.

1518
00:42:46,571 --> 00:42:46,660
Call.

1519
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,470
It would be like a punch that you don't
think should land had filled a goatee.

1520
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,383
Yeah.

1521
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,970
Balaclava what he's doing.

1522
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,430
These interviews deprive him of that.

1523
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,600
But when he was fighting machine mine,

1524
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:58,450
he was calling him
mishy mash up like this,

1525
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,230
these eyes.

1526
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:02,990
So it was the fighter that while the,

1527
00:43:02,991 --> 00:43:03,230
uh,

1528
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,970
the referees reading the instructions,

1529
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:07,730
he's like mugging to the camera
with his big giant smell,

1530
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:08,660
the gold teeth.

1531
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:09,590
He was,

1532
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,600
he was another character
right out of a fucking movie.

1533
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:11,711
Yeah.

1534
00:43:11,711 --> 00:43:11,840
Yeah.

1535
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,090
He was constantly getting
arrested constantly.

1536
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:15,710
I hung out with that dude.

1537
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,490
Me and him and Eddie Bravo hung
out with him and his girlfriend.

1538
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:20,810
We watched some fights together.

1539
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:21,441
Um,

1540
00:43:21,441 --> 00:43:22,340
it was when,

1541
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:22,580
uh,

1542
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,070
k one did an event in,

1543
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,400
think it was k one did an
event in Hollywood and a it,

1544
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,430
it's some soccer stadium,

1545
00:43:29,431 --> 00:43:30,410
some outdoor stadium.

1546
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,860
And just by chance we sat
right next to each other.

1547
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,230
I had a great time with that dude.

1548
00:43:36,231 --> 00:43:37,730
That dude was hilarious.

1549
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,850
We were just laughing
at everything he was.

1550
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:41,120
He's,

1551
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,950
he's a wild motherfucker.

1552
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,190
It's Kinda cool sometimes when you get
get exposed to one of those people just

1553
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:46,881
for a few hours.

1554
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:47,110
Like,

1555
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:47,360
yeah,

1556
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,360
I had a college like from Hollywood to
Temecula and back with mayhem and it was

1557
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:54,530
like one of the most high speed,

1558
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,640
scariest rides.

1559
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:56,474
It haven't been on,

1560
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:56,870
like,

1561
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,230
he's like sitting in the driver's seat
with a shirt with like guns all over it

1562
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:03,740
and a big chain with a gun on their
sunglasses on and he's just like speeding.

1563
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,270
And every now and then he said he's like,

1564
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:06,350
police track thing will beep.

1565
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:07,460
And they were like hitting the brakes,

1566
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,640
swerving in and out and talking
to a hundred miles an hour.

1567
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,540
And it's like two hours
from there and it's five,

1568
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,860
four hours of that as well as the
training session in the middle.

1569
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,550
I was exhausted by the time I
got really lucky to be alive.

1570
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:20,570
I needed like three days.

1571
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,310
I hung out with clay.

1572
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:22,641
Guido,

1573
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:23,960
what weekend in Chicago.

1574
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,910
Then he took me to my show.

1575
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,040
He insisted on taking me to my show.

1576
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:28,671
So it was,

1577
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:28,910
uh,

1578
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:31,260
me and him and Eddie Bravo and a clay.

1579
00:44:31,261 --> 00:44:32,094
Guido was dry.

1580
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,600
He Clay Guinta drives like light.

1581
00:44:34,601 --> 00:44:35,434
He fights.

1582
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,320
He drives exactly like he fights,

1583
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,990
but just sitting there just going,

1584
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,833
whoa.

1585
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,180
Like I trust him.

1586
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:43,410
I think he knows what he's doing.

1587
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:43,631
Oh,

1588
00:44:43,631 --> 00:44:44,381
Sam Aaa.

1589
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:46,630
I just got back from driving with him.

1590
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,410
You let Sam dry is the scariest man.

1591
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:55,030
He's just like sideswiping swiping cars
while texting and talking on the phone.

1592
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,680
I let them text and drive.

1593
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:57,431
He just,

1594
00:44:57,431 --> 00:44:58,570
he was just out of control.

1595
00:44:58,571 --> 00:44:59,530
It's so funny,

1596
00:44:59,531 --> 00:44:59,681
man.

1597
00:44:59,681 --> 00:45:01,420
I was scared out of my mind.

1598
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:05,700
That's bad man and now and I gave him
my car to drive up to San Francisco.

1599
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,700
I was like,

1600
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,490
I didn't know how bad it was and
then when I was up there I was like,

1601
00:45:09,491 --> 00:45:09,911
oh shit,

1602
00:45:09,911 --> 00:45:10,750
he has to drive home.

1603
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,231
And I was like,

1604
00:45:11,231 --> 00:45:12,130
oh please Tony,

1605
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,780
just please drive most of the time.

1606
00:45:13,781 --> 00:45:16,600
And so they drove your car up.

1607
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:17,933
In fact,

1608
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,181
God damn,

1609
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:20,200
that's a long ride.

1610
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,730
How much is a southwest flight?

1611
00:45:21,731 --> 00:45:22,600
Took a hundred bucks.

1612
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:23,471
Cheap.

1613
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,160
Fuck hot.

1614
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,371
No,

1615
00:45:24,371 --> 00:45:25,390
it was like I had this,

1616
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,700
I spent like $500 round trip for,

1617
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,290
for going up there for some reason.

1618
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:32,720
I don't know if it was because of
that Cinco de Mayo or whatever.

1619
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,371
Probably.

1620
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:33,890
Right.

1621
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,230
They Jack up rates.

1622
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,760
Southwest doesn't go
direct to a San Francisco.

1623
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,080
They don't know.

1624
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:41,890
Isn't that weird?

1625
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:42,520
Yeah,

1626
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,600
that's crazy Nigga.

1627
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,920
I know they go to San Jose.

1628
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:45,760
Yeah,

1629
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,260
that's not far from San Francisco.

1630
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,230
You could do San Jose and then
he'd drive for like 30 minutes.

1631
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,520
What was going to do Oakland,

1632
00:45:51,521 --> 00:45:54,640
but you have to take that stupid
thing underneath the ocean.

1633
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:55,040
I was like,

1634
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:55,471
don't do it.

1635
00:45:55,471 --> 00:45:57,070
You've already scared me enough to,

1636
00:45:57,071 --> 00:45:58,750
it never did at the bar.

1637
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,420
Have you ever done the
Bart in San Francisco?

1638
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,580
We were filming fear factor in Oakland
and I ate a pot cookie or something and

1639
00:46:06,581 --> 00:46:09,400
my hotel room because I was hanging out
with the crew and they were really cool

1640
00:46:09,401 --> 00:46:09,970
guys.

1641
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,230
But you know,

1642
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:12,430
I was,

1643
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,030
I was like,

1644
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:16,180
I have this cookie and let me just say
would probably make it more interesting

1645
00:46:16,181 --> 00:46:17,014
hanging out with these.

1646
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,250
So I take this,

1647
00:46:19,251 --> 00:46:19,580
uh,

1648
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,331
it's not an insult.

1649
00:46:20,331 --> 00:46:21,050
They were,

1650
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:21,920
but they were straight.

1651
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:22,763
It's my point.

1652
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:23,541
Wouldn't say,

1653
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:23,930
Hey,

1654
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:24,920
who wants some pot cookies?

1655
00:46:24,921 --> 00:46:25,191
You'd be like,

1656
00:46:25,191 --> 00:46:25,391
oh,

1657
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:26,224
hold on me.

1658
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:27,141
Oh No,

1659
00:46:27,141 --> 00:46:27,291
no,

1660
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:27,530
no,

1661
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,460
you're not gonna get me that.

1662
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:28,881
You know what?

1663
00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:29,720
Are you crazy?

1664
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,381
I don't think so.

1665
00:46:30,381 --> 00:46:30,750
Powell.

1666
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:30,841
Oh,

1667
00:46:30,841 --> 00:46:31,551
you meant straight late.

1668
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:32,384
They don't drink drugs.

1669
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,560
They don't fuck around.

1670
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:34,530
Were strict.

1671
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,151
No.

1672
00:46:35,151 --> 00:46:35,421
Yeah.

1673
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:35,721
I was like,

1674
00:46:35,721 --> 00:46:37,310
well it couldn't have
good success with them.

1675
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,320
No,

1676
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,530
they were straight straight arrows.

1677
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,830
Like you could offer them a drink.

1678
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,510
I'll have a margarita.

1679
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,950
I know they get crazy.

1680
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,240
I'll have a Margarita,

1681
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:48,470
but if you like,

1682
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:51,260
who wants to eat some hash
fucking get the fuck away from me.

1683
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,520
So eight this pot cooking
and I get on this bar thing,

1684
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:55,820
man,

1685
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:56,690
I am flying.

1686
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,490
I just totally over modulated.

1687
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,110
Sometimes you just,

1688
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:01,370
you don't know what
the fuck you're eating.

1689
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,200
Just eat one and it just puts you,

1690
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,630
it puts you in almost
like in another dimension.

1691
00:47:05,631 --> 00:47:08,210
It's like you like your
face is under a waterfall,

1692
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,300
like about to peer to the other side.

1693
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,790
Just can't quite get there like
that high and my ears are ringing.

1694
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:15,500
I'm like more pop and I'm like,

1695
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:16,660
why am I even popping?

1696
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,301
And they go,

1697
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,010
because we're 500 feet under water.

1698
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:21,020
I was like,

1699
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,670
what the fuck he talking about?

1700
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,920
Never said yes to this.

1701
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,020
If you asked me do you want to
go in a fucking that's under the

1702
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,300
ocean in a place where the ground moves,

1703
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:32,691
I would have said,

1704
00:47:32,691 --> 00:47:33,501
fuck you.

1705
00:47:33,501 --> 00:47:34,670
I don't want to do that.

1706
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,110
Why are we doing that?

1707
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,210
That's like playing musical chairs.

1708
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:38,900
You know?

1709
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,540
I can catch a train from
my apartment in Nottingham.

1710
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:42,650
I found this out through the day.

1711
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:46,010
I've been telling everybody and catch a
train from my apartment in Nottingham to

1712
00:47:46,011 --> 00:47:46,844
Saigon.

1713
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,600
What?

1714
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,180
Right.

1715
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,280
How is that possible?

1716
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:50,143
Exactly.

1717
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,540
The problem is the only
part of the journey I would
struggle with is the channel

1718
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:53,940
tunnel.

1719
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,773
It's

1720
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:59,920
like apparently apparently one train has
to stop while the other one goes past

1721
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:01,310
because the pressure would just

1722
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:05,380
go under the ocean under the ocean.

1723
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,700
The fuck with that shit.

1724
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:09,710
That is a movie waiting to happen.

1725
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,650
They will tell your story for many,

1726
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:13,880
many years in the future.

1727
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,280
Get the fuck Outta here.

1728
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:18,980
It was like a titanic kind of
movie into fuck that movie.

1729
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:19,940
That movie sucks.

1730
00:48:19,941 --> 00:48:21,470
You do not want to be in that movie.

1731
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,810
You don't want to be dude in
tunnels of concrete under seawater.

1732
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,340
Just seeing the rocks
tumbling towards you.

1733
00:48:28,341 --> 00:48:32,270
Enormous rocks with walls
of water behind them,

1734
00:48:32,271 --> 00:48:35,030
pushing them rocks at
her thousands of pounds.

1735
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:39,630
And it's a matter of 10 15 seconds for
the hit in that circumstance as well.

1736
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,790
You're so insignificant.

1737
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:41,930
You don't matter bitch.

1738
00:48:41,931 --> 00:48:44,240
You are a footnote in
history and that's a wrap.

1739
00:48:44,241 --> 00:48:45,980
Son cleaned her up.

1740
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:46,671
You're clear.

1741
00:48:46,671 --> 00:48:47,504
Mr. Hardy.

1742
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,720
Thank you for playing this life and
that's why I didn't go to that airport.

1743
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:52,783
Good move.

1744
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:53,991
Good move.

1745
00:48:53,991 --> 00:48:55,010
Now that you put it that way,

1746
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:55,341
can we,

1747
00:48:55,341 --> 00:48:55,591
can I,

1748
00:48:55,591 --> 00:48:55,940
can I,

1749
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,220
can I bring up with
that funny thing I saw?

1750
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:58,640
No,

1751
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:58,930
no,

1752
00:48:58,930 --> 00:48:59,100
no,

1753
00:48:59,100 --> 00:48:59,933
no,

1754
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:00,481
no,

1755
00:49:00,481 --> 00:49:00,670
no,

1756
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:00,900
no,

1757
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,733
no,

1758
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,011
no,

1759
00:49:02,011 --> 00:49:02,850
because I'll get mad.

1760
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:05,580
It's unfortunately,

1761
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,043
it's so funny.

1762
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,343
Um,

1763
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:09,840
Dan Hardee you a,

1764
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,490
you recently went to the jungle.

1765
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:12,690
I did in the jungle.

1766
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,410
You recently had an experience
in the spirit world.

1767
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:17,263
I did.

1768
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:18,110
That sounds,

1769
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,890
doesn't that sound rig a
ridiculous thing to say?

1770
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:25,370
You sound like one of those be wearing
fucking Birkenstock wearing assholes.

1771
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,020
Like if you say something like that,

1772
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:28,140
like,

1773
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,271
yeah,

1774
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:29,220
I went to spirit world.

1775
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:29,831
Oh yeah,

1776
00:49:29,831 --> 00:49:30,630
you did you,

1777
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:31,430
you fuck,

1778
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,270
I do yoga like five times a week now.

1779
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:34,104
I'm really not helping.

1780
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,073
How

1781
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:37,430
are you willing to go?

1782
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,263
The beads,

1783
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:39,253
the beads.

1784
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,000
This is like a certain thing too.

1785
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:41,361
It's like,

1786
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:43,330
it sucks when someone's faking that.

1787
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:44,240
Yeah,

1788
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:44,730
no,

1789
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,130
yeah,

1790
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:45,760
but oh,

1791
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,860
just bend some white sage and the better,

1792
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:48,221
it's like,

1793
00:49:48,221 --> 00:49:48,790
you know,

1794
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:49,060
I,

1795
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,810
you can see those people from a mile away.

1796
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:51,680
Oh No.

1797
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,790
It got great praise on older women.

1798
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,953
Yeah.

1799
00:49:56,350 --> 00:50:00,970
He's got this older woman and she's
quite a bit older than him and less

1800
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:01,810
attractive to him,

1801
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,670
but he's young and fairly useless and
like this fake guru type character.

1802
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:07,811
And you know,

1803
00:50:07,811 --> 00:50:08,591
there's a documentary,

1804
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:09,311
I can't what it's called.

1805
00:50:09,311 --> 00:50:12,210
It's on Netflix and it's
a guy who he goes out to.

1806
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:13,044
Have you seen it?

1807
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:13,621
Goes out to it?

1808
00:50:13,621 --> 00:50:13,991
Oh No,

1809
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:14,801
I haven't seen it,

1810
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:15,011
but I've,

1811
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,120
I've heard about to watch it.

1812
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,460
He makes a fake religion fake gurry yeah.

1813
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:19,660
Yeah.

1814
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,010
If it becomes a fake girl,

1815
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:21,700
let's see,

1816
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,810
document around fake group.

1817
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:23,963
Uh,

1818
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:28,460
Netflix just poured that plug
in like 2000 live movies.

1819
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,121
They just did.

1820
00:50:29,121 --> 00:50:29,940
They really,

1821
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,430
cause they lost contracts with,

1822
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:33,440
I think it was a Warner
brothers or something.

1823
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:35,180
But like South Park's gone,

1824
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,550
like a lot of shit was gone from it.

1825
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:42,551
Right now Kumar is a true film about a
false prophet with a watch is kind of

1826
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:46,124
interesting.

1827
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:48,651
It's fucked.

1828
00:50:48,651 --> 00:50:50,120
How easy it is to trick people.

1829
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:51,320
That's unfortunate.

1830
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:52,563
You know,

1831
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,690
people want,

1832
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:58,810
you know why I think this is why I
think it's because it's an insanely rare

1833
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:05,051
quality to be truly enlightened or
even truly on the path of enlightened,

1834
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:11,510
which a true path of enlightenment
with true focus and you know,

1835
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:15,560
and and on a path for a real,

1836
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:19,500
the pure sake of trying to
figure out what this life is,

1837
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:21,200
figuring out how to live this life better.

1838
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,790
There's so few people really,

1839
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:23,740
really doing that.

1840
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,020
That to even like attempt
to do it is so douchey.

1841
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:27,470
Ish.

1842
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,330
It's intimidating to
think for yourself though.

1843
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,650
And that's where a lot of people fall.

1844
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:31,430
You know,

1845
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:31,651
it's,

1846
00:51:31,651 --> 00:51:32,750
it's scary to think for yourself.

1847
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,220
So they want somebody
else to do it for them.

1848
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,001
It is,

1849
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:35,721
but it's also,

1850
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:40,721
we don't like people proclaiming that
there is something more grand than the

1851
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:42,361
rest of us.

1852
00:51:42,361 --> 00:51:43,160
Yeah.

1853
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,790
Some people we don't like people
proclaiming that they're on the path to

1854
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:50,180
figuring out where you're screaming in
your car at a red light and you can't

1855
00:51:50,181 --> 00:51:52,340
balance a checkbook and you know,

1856
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,203
you know what I mean?

1857
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:58,100
People don't want to believe that there's
a guy who really does do yoga every

1858
00:51:58,101 --> 00:52:02,450
day and really does like find his center
and it's made him a more joyous person.

1859
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:04,740
Sad that that is what I hear from you.

1860
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,250
A lot of you talking about you buddy.

1861
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:11,210
That's what I hear a lot of you
being impressed with yourself.

1862
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,500
A lot of your fucking annoying with
your flip flops and that that's what

1863
00:52:15,501 --> 00:52:15,981
happens.

1864
00:52:15,981 --> 00:52:18,170
It's like there's so many of those guys,

1865
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:19,423
there's so many,

1866
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:19,970
but it's,

1867
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,930
I had this doctor a mic go swami in
here once a theoretical physicist guy,

1868
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:29,050
genius guy and he was saying
that sometimes people have
to fake things in order

1869
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:31,550
to really truly make them happen.

1870
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,260
Like,

1871
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,350
like I let people,

1872
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:33,771
he's like,

1873
00:52:33,771 --> 00:52:36,680
I let people use the word quantum when
I know they don't really know what it

1874
00:52:36,681 --> 00:52:37,514
means.

1875
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:39,950
But he's like,

1876
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:44,120
but if this guy like has
interest in like faking it,

1877
00:52:44,121 --> 00:52:48,110
like maybe it would lead to a real
interest in trying to understand quantum

1878
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:48,944
science.

1879
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:49,641
And I was like,

1880
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:50,451
wow,

1881
00:52:50,451 --> 00:52:53,690
that's a fucking interesting
way to look at it and say like,

1882
00:52:53,691 --> 00:52:54,590
so I go,

1883
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:57,650
so like false gurus and play go
say just to let them fake it.

1884
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,100
Which I guess,

1885
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:01,640
yeah,

1886
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,473
I guess,

1887
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,950
but you know,

1888
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:04,784
then they start,

1889
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:05,330
you know,

1890
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:07,610
fucking everybody's wives and well yeah,

1891
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:08,810
yeah.

1892
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,100
Kill all the male babies.

1893
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,653
You know,

1894
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,970
it always go south always.

1895
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,820
And it's always a maligned and shit.

1896
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:18,230
His had been a woman run ever.

1897
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,690
Can you tell me that there's a fucking,

1898
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:26,230
just that alone is great evidence that
women are way less dangerous than men.

1899
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,310
Yeah,

1900
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:29,910
they did.

1901
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:32,430
They have less of a desire
to control the environment.

1902
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:32,911
Yeah.

1903
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:35,430
Even if you have a
shitty woman boss Shane,

1904
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:36,264
no cult leader,

1905
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,960
not the closest woman called leader.

1906
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:43,710
She's the closest to a woman
caught later cause she kind of is.

1907
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:44,191
Yeah.

1908
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:45,390
She's kind of running a call.

1909
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,500
She's running a cult of happiness amongst
women over 35 Chardonnay called spark.

1910
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:53,643
Make all,

1911
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:54,870
yeah.

1912
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:55,231
Yeah.

1913
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:56,040
She's,

1914
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,521
that's her.

1915
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:57,241
Her Shit.

1916
00:53:57,241 --> 00:53:58,460
I guess she could run a cult,

1917
00:53:58,980 --> 00:53:59,401
you know,

1918
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:03,750
but like there's not a lot of women who
could pull that off and run a call and

1919
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,460
what the world looks like
from her perspective,

1920
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,870
from Oprah's perspective,

1921
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,570
it's gotta be insanity is first of all,

1922
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:12,420
how many women have ever
achieved that before?

1923
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:12,931
How many,

1924
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:14,400
it's not like you're a man.

1925
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:16,680
If you're a man and
you're like a media mogul,

1926
00:54:16,681 --> 00:54:17,010
it's like,

1927
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,120
oh look another one,

1928
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:19,800
another Richard Branson,

1929
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:20,461
another this,

1930
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:20,761
another,

1931
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:21,151
that,

1932
00:54:21,151 --> 00:54:21,420
another,

1933
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:21,961
that guy.

1934
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:25,130
This guy is always a new
guy is always some new guys.

1935
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,090
Big Loud mouth is on TV all the time.

1936
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:27,930
It makes a lot of money.

1937
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:29,100
There's always that guy.

1938
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:29,710
Yeah.

1939
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,500
Well how many of those girls,

1940
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:35,730
how many girls have just had all these
women screaming and cheering whether they

1941
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:36,630
see her,

1942
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,670
she gives away cars and shit.

1943
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,680
Saves people in Africa.

1944
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,573
How many girls?

1945
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:41,830
What does,

1946
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,620
is there one other one ever?

1947
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:48,270
The Angelina Jo leads kind of like
rocking it in some sort of weird way,

1948
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,130
but she doesn't have like a talk show,

1949
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,940
but she's talking every day.

1950
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:52,783
She's like,

1951
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:53,910
can't control.

1952
00:54:53,911 --> 00:54:56,690
That's like you can give people
instructions and they'll follow it.

1953
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,790
Go and buy this and millions of
women will go out and buy it.

1954
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,350
That's scary power.

1955
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:01,980
Yeah.

1956
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,820
Oprah powers.

1957
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:03,560
Weird power.

1958
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:03,830
That's,

1959
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,960
it's very rare that a
human achieves that bit,

1960
00:55:05,961 --> 00:55:06,600
but she can't,

1961
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,440
she has to sacrifice like real
relationships with people we like.

1962
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:12,810
You can't have a real connection
with anybody or you can't develop new

1963
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:15,360
connections when you get
to that kind of status.

1964
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,413
I don't think so.

1965
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,240
I wonder if you don't let anybody in.

1966
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:19,081
I don't know.

1967
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:19,470
Well,

1968
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:21,870
the only reason you wouldn't is if you
think that you're better than other

1969
00:55:21,871 --> 00:55:23,430
people because you're successful.

1970
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:24,730
The,

1971
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:25,180
the,

1972
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:28,590
the issue of running into people that
have wanted to take advantage of you,

1973
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,690
you're going to have that
no matter what you know,

1974
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,110
you would hope that your filter is
good enough that you'd be able to,

1975
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,280
but when it gets to this stage,

1976
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:38,420
you can't go anywhere without
someone recognizing your,

1977
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:40,260
like everybody knows who you are.

1978
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:40,411
Yeah.

1979
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:41,370
You fucked up son.

1980
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,630
You took it too deep.

1981
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:46,800
Should've backed off Elvis
to stay alive longer.

1982
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,080
Never go full retail.

1983
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:50,640
Yeah.

1984
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,390
There's something that happens to people
when they get that cuckoo Fayez you

1985
00:55:54,391 --> 00:55:54,541
know,

1986
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:56,040
they get that over the top.

1987
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:57,000
I just didn't vivas

1988
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,590
young man's gone.

1989
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,071
You can text him,

1990
00:56:00,071 --> 00:56:00,510
man.

1991
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:01,320
He tried to take,

1992
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:01,470
uh,

1993
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:03,420
a monkey to Germany to the day.

1994
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,020
Like what the fuck is that?

1995
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:09,300
That's what you do when you're fucking
17 years old and he fucked a million

1996
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:11,940
girls a day for the past year

1997
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,890
and you look like you're four and he's
a little being unreasonable because they

1998
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:17,820
wanted to take his monkey out.

1999
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:18,810
They are unreasonable.

2000
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,160
He's Justin motherfucking Bieber,

2001
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,121
Justin Bieber.

2002
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:24,150
He could go to a restaurant and like
put his hands and say hello everybody.

2003
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,980
And they would start sharing
and just start clapping.

2004
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,780
Twerp Justin Bieber's here,

2005
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,393
swag.

2006
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:30,061
They would go,

2007
00:56:30,061 --> 00:56:30,541
oh my God.

2008
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:31,500
He just said Swag.

2009
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:32,760
What's,

2010
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,080
but that's his thing.

2011
00:56:34,081 --> 00:56:35,010
So swag all the time.

2012
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:35,844
How do you know that?

2013
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,683
I know a lot that

2014
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,020
we've talked about it in the podcast.

2015
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,280
You fucking stoner hag.

2016
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:42,203
Yes.

2017
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:46,090
You don't pay attention and things
like that that you blacked me out.

2018
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,190
Like I'm looking old marriage.

2019
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,190
You blocked me out like we're married.

2020
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:53,431
He,

2021
00:56:53,431 --> 00:56:54,160
um,

2022
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,491
yeah,

2023
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:54,630
he,

2024
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:55,463
he's um,

2025
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:57,150
I know a dude who,

2026
00:56:57,151 --> 00:56:57,540
uh,

2027
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,460
has done work for,

2028
00:56:59,461 --> 00:56:59,970
uh,

2029
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:00,810
Mr Beaver.

2030
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:01,950
He said it's a very nice guy.

2031
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:03,530
Nice kid.

2032
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:04,141
I met his dad too.

2033
00:57:04,141 --> 00:57:05,820
I met him and his dad at a UFC fight.

2034
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:07,290
Let him like very briefly,

2035
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:08,190
we had headphones on.

2036
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:08,400
They,

2037
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,233
they shook our hands.

2038
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:09,630
Hi.

2039
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:09,900
Hi.

2040
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,733
How are you doing?

2041
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,760
And then the fight was going on,

2042
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,840
but uh,

2043
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:17,460
no one could ask anyone to be able to
handle that situation any better than that

2044
00:57:17,461 --> 00:57:18,294
kid's doing.

2045
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:18,870
He's doing okay.

2046
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:19,890
Way better than I would do.

2047
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,170
Could you imagine what fucking damage
you would have done that famous?

2048
00:57:25,171 --> 00:57:27,610
It's 17 that must be ridiculous.

2049
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,850
I did enough time to get 17 and I was

2050
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:32,640
just,

2051
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,960
what kind of life is that?

2052
00:57:33,961 --> 00:57:35,400
That's that guy lives.

2053
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:35,791
He,

2054
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:37,560
there's only one person on the planet

2055
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,410
that lives like that.

2056
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:39,243
That's him.

2057
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,800
Like who is he going
to compare notes with?

2058
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,320
I don't know who's going
to understand his life.

2059
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:47,290
Like Britney Spears was that
kind of level at one point.

2060
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,630
You know what happened to her?

2061
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:50,450
She went crazy.

2062
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:51,283
She blew a fuse.

2063
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,280
I'm kind of excited for it just to be
with sort of to lose his mind as well,

2064
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,760
but it's just how is it going to happen,

2065
00:57:57,761 --> 00:57:58,210
you know?

2066
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,680
Is he going to stop by and
like wild animals and fill
this house with them or to

2067
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:02,500
money in the bank?

2068
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:02,981
I used to do it.

2069
00:58:02,981 --> 00:58:03,070
Yeah.

2070
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,500
Joke about before Macaulay
Culkin went crazy.

2071
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,930
I used to do a joke about
how he's money in the bank.

2072
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,250
It's like he,

2073
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,320
this ain't gonna won't
turn out well this is you.

2074
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:13,620
You're not always going to be that guy.

2075
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:15,710
You're going to be like
a man someday is gonna

2076
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,553
be weird.

2077
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:17,151
Like you,

2078
00:58:17,151 --> 00:58:18,190
you became a,

2079
00:58:18,191 --> 00:58:18,520
you,

2080
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:22,280
you became unbelievably
famous while you were a child.

2081
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,120
How could you possibly handle that
hanging out with Michael Jackson?

2082
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:28,910
Jesus Christ.

2083
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:30,321
You know,

2084
00:58:30,321 --> 00:58:31,670
there was a guy who got arrested.

2085
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,500
He was like one of those famous,

2086
00:58:33,501 --> 00:58:33,740
uh,

2087
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,790
Hollywood,

2088
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:35,570
uh,

2089
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:36,960
like investigative guys,

2090
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,480
like a strong arm investigator.

2091
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,560
And uh,

2092
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,890
he had done some work with
Michael Jackson and that the war,

2093
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,920
what he says is that he wanted to
check in and make sure that all the

2094
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,690
molestation allegations were,

2095
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:52,280
were incorrect,

2096
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:57,020
and he said he wouldn't work with Michael
Jackson because he did something worse

2097
00:58:57,021 --> 00:58:57,854
than molest them.

2098
00:58:59,110 --> 00:58:59,750
What,

2099
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,420
what that means know,

2100
00:59:02,421 --> 00:59:04,760
I couldn't even imagine
what the fuck that means,

2101
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,940
but it was enough spin on things.

2102
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,560
It was enough that he wouldn't,

2103
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:10,580
he wouldn't work with a guy.

2104
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:12,140
Yeah.

2105
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,010
I don't know if that's true.

2106
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:13,491
I mean,

2107
00:59:13,491 --> 00:59:14,150
he's in jail.

2108
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,090
The guy who did is in jail
and he did a lot of nefarious,

2109
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:22,000
semi illegal type shit until a strong arm.

2110
00:59:22,001 --> 00:59:22,350
Shit,

2111
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,183
you know.

2112
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:27,390
But it seems like you had a little bit
of a code and it seems like a whatever

2113
00:59:27,391 --> 00:59:29,610
Michael Jackson was
doing according to him,

2114
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:30,444
at least.

2115
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:31,351
That's scary,

2116
00:59:31,351 --> 00:59:32,070
man.

2117
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,920
We were talking about Cleveland and
we're talking about what happened in

2118
00:59:34,921 --> 00:59:37,050
Cleveland before the show starts.

2119
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:37,440
Yeah.

2120
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,100
These,

2121
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,761
these guys,

2122
00:59:38,761 --> 00:59:42,570
these three brothers had kidnapped these
three girls and kept them locked up for

2123
00:59:42,571 --> 00:59:43,440
10 years.

2124
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,640
So they each got one.

2125
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:45,540
I don't know.

2126
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,380
I don't know what they did.

2127
00:59:46,381 --> 00:59:46,651
I don't,

2128
00:59:46,651 --> 00:59:48,420
I don't know the full
details of the story,

2129
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:49,051
but,

2130
00:59:49,051 --> 00:59:49,230
uh,

2131
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:49,980
the guy who,

2132
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:50,760
uh,

2133
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,440
who saved him as his black dude,

2134
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:53,161
he,

2135
00:59:53,161 --> 00:59:53,670
uh,

2136
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:58,670
he said that something happened and I
think you heard some screaming and like he

2137
00:59:58,921 --> 01:00:01,110
kicked down a door as
he robbing the place.

2138
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:02,143
No,

2139
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:02,730
no.

2140
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,110
We just [inaudible] them.

2141
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,570
He's trying to save
them racists little fuck

2142
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:08,730
you G.

2143
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,281
I know what you're doing.

2144
01:00:09,281 --> 01:00:11,430
I'm just trying to keep black people
from coming to your shows ever.

2145
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:12,793
I know what you're doing.

2146
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:14,423
Noises.

2147
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,301
I mean,

2148
01:00:15,301 --> 01:00:18,690
I was breaking into their
place and he say he,

2149
01:00:18,691 --> 01:00:19,080
um,

2150
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,120
he said it was a really interesting thing.

2151
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,260
You got to see the interview.

2152
01:00:22,261 --> 01:00:24,300
The guys really entertaining
and the guy who saved him pull,

2153
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,040
pull up the interview cause
it's pretty fascinating.

2154
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,420
And then don't worry folks,

2155
01:00:27,421 --> 01:00:28,890
we're still going to talk
about the spirit world.

2156
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:31,290
I know we got off subject but the same,

2157
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:32,401
you know at the Saint,

2158
01:00:32,401 --> 01:00:34,470
the Cornell Brian show bitch doesn't,

2159
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,470
it doesn't you got requests?

2160
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:37,740
No,

2161
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:38,573
I know people want to hear.

2162
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,350
Oh okay.

2163
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:40,183
No they do.

2164
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,960
I can't listen to the request.

2165
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:45,210
Like while the show's going on too many
people would just write fucked up shit

2166
01:00:45,211 --> 01:00:46,110
and tried to get my attention.

2167
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:48,383
What's that?

2168
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:50,323
That's one.

2169
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,690
His name's James Ramsay.

2170
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,530
Is that his name?

2171
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:53,363
James Ramsey.

2172
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:54,191
Yeah,

2173
01:00:54,191 --> 01:00:55,020
the Charles Ramsey.

2174
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:55,681
Charles Ramsey.

2175
01:00:55,681 --> 01:00:56,450
Charles Ramsey.

2176
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:59,070
[inaudible] guy's a bad motherfucker.

2177
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,090
He saved those girls.

2178
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,440
They were in there for 10 years.

2179
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:04,920
These guys were holding
them captive for 10 years.

2180
01:01:04,921 --> 01:01:09,921
Like what the fuck happens to people that
allows them to do something like that?

2181
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,140
I Dunno.

2182
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:12,950
I Dunno.

2183
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:15,530
Like w w is what is
their view of the world?

2184
01:01:15,531 --> 01:01:16,190
Like how,

2185
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:17,630
how do they see their own actions?

2186
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:19,640
How did they get to be that thing?

2187
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:20,180
Yeah.

2188
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:20,661
How did they,

2189
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:21,740
that's the real question.

2190
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:22,251
What,

2191
01:01:22,251 --> 01:01:23,750
who did something to them,

2192
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:24,440
they must have,

2193
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,730
they must have peace with it in some way.

2194
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:27,703
10 years,

2195
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:28,580
10 years,

2196
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:29,010
a long time.

2197
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:29,870
So have second thoughts,

2198
01:01:29,871 --> 01:01:30,620
you know.

2199
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,221
Oh yeah.

2200
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:31,971
I mean I don't think,

2201
01:01:31,971 --> 01:01:32,900
I think they were just,

2202
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:33,321
that was,

2203
01:01:33,321 --> 01:01:33,960
they own them,

2204
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,210
that they were going to keep it that way.

2205
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,940
But how do you come to the
conclusion that that's okay?

2206
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,260
I don't know.

2207
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:40,303
I don't know.

2208
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:41,720
I couldn't imagine

2209
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,660
I have this conversation with,

2210
01:01:43,661 --> 01:01:45,310
with the people about Michael Vick.

2211
01:01:45,311 --> 01:01:45,810
You know,

2212
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:48,580
I'm always kind of vocal about that
and that situation with the dog.

2213
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,533
Yes.

2214
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:50,320
Dude.

2215
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,153
Here's the dude.

2216
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:53,120
Huh?

2217
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:53,310
How?

2218
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:54,111
Pause it for a second.

2219
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:54,501
Cause I want to,

2220
01:01:54,501 --> 01:01:55,610
I want you to hear what you said.

2221
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,960
I have to say about this cause yeah,

2222
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:57,620
I,

2223
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,330
that disturbs the shit out of me too.

2224
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:00,523
They had the Michael Vick.

2225
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,081
Yeah.

2226
01:02:01,081 --> 01:02:02,160
I mean it's like I went,

2227
01:02:02,161 --> 01:02:02,731
I was up in,

2228
01:02:02,731 --> 01:02:03,080
uh,

2229
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:03,370
uh,

2230
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:06,060
Utah a couple of weeks ago for
the victory Doug's reunion,

2231
01:02:06,061 --> 01:02:07,020
which is basically the,

2232
01:02:07,021 --> 01:02:07,950
the dogs that were,

2233
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:08,760
were saved.

2234
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,170
I think they took 58.

2235
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:11,730
Uh,

2236
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:13,680
some of them were euthanized
because they were too bad.

2237
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:14,580
Um,

2238
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:17,190
but most of them were taken to a place
called the best friends animal sanctuary.

2239
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,024
And uh,

2240
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:20,220
some of them will stay there
for the rest of their lives

2241
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,470
because they can't be with
other dogs and you know,

2242
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,483
right.

2243
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:24,420
Yeah.

2244
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:25,970
Like the grand champions and stuff,

2245
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:27,630
they all scarred up and stuff,

2246
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:28,500
but a lot of them got,

2247
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:28,890
uh,

2248
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:31,830
got adopted and all the family
stay quite close and they,

2249
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,040
you know,

2250
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,020
they bring the dogs together
so they can socialize.

2251
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:34,950
But you know,

2252
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:37,350
like some of these dogs that got
chemical burns on their back,

2253
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:40,560
there's one little dog that walks sideways
because it was thrown against a wall

2254
01:02:40,561 --> 01:02:41,394
as a puppy.

2255
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:41,991
Like,

2256
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:42,380
like how,

2257
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:44,880
how do you get to the stage where you
think that that's an all right thing to

2258
01:02:44,881 --> 01:02:45,714
do?

2259
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:46,760
Like that's,

2260
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,250
that's not,

2261
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,760
you don't get better from that.

2262
01:02:48,761 --> 01:02:49,970
And that's not something that you're,

2263
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,120
now he's got another dog,

2264
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,550
like he showed up in a pet
smart or the day without this,

2265
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:56,220
it's like some kind of military dog.

2266
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,750
He shouldn't have been that it was
anything right with the world that Doug's

2267
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,110
going to go for his throat at some point.

2268
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:02,670
Was He allowed to have dogs?

2269
01:03:02,671 --> 01:03:03,504
Ridiculous.

2270
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,070
All the dogs he killed.

2271
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:05,551
But you don't,

2272
01:03:05,551 --> 01:03:06,990
you don't heal from something like that.

2273
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:07,824
That's something that,

2274
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,290
that's just something that's,

2275
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,140
that's who you are.

2276
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:11,180
Well,

2277
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:11,590
I don't,

2278
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:12,423
I don't think,

2279
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:15,390
what is the story that he
killed a bunch of them,

2280
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:15,660
right?

2281
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,020
Yeah.

2282
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:16,441
To be killed.

2283
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:18,540
Them throwing them on the floor.

2284
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,100
Electrocuting them hanging them.

2285
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:20,821
Yeah,

2286
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:22,320
he did like torture is shit.

2287
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:22,590
Yeah.

2288
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:22,791
He,

2289
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:25,050
he had a bad reputation in
the dog fight and community.

2290
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:26,101
I mean,

2291
01:03:26,101 --> 01:03:28,320
God like 58 dogs yet.

2292
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:29,400
Oh my God.

2293
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:29,910
Yeah.

2294
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:33,240
He had a bad reputation and
the dog fighting community,

2295
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:33,661
you know,

2296
01:03:33,661 --> 01:03:36,690
your con when the dog
fighting world is like,

2297
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:36,960
Hey,

2298
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,460
I need to sell the fuck down.

2299
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:39,600
You're being mean.

2300
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:40,080
Yeah.

2301
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:40,501
That's some,

2302
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:40,950

2303
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,240
that's a whole new level of mean.

2304
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:43,440
Holy Shit.

2305
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:44,041
I have a,

2306
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:45,750
I have a friend who
adopted one of his dogs.

2307
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:46,500
Um,

2308
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,333
this little dog,

2309
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,230
when you take into a room,

2310
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:50,820
it will go and sit in
the corner and shake.

2311
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:51,720
Oh God.

2312
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,540
And it just,

2313
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,830
you can't go near it without
it just shaking uncontrollably.

2314
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:56,950
And that was a,

2315
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:57,130
yeah,

2316
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:58,440
I think they call them bait dogs.

2317
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:02,370
We're basically a muzzle on the dog and
use it as like a confidence builder for

2318
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:02,780
the,

2319
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:03,840
the fight in dogs.

2320
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:04,674
They're successful.

2321
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:05,620
Oh God.

2322
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:06,453
So it,

2323
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,460
but the size of the dog that they bullied.

2324
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:08,910
Yeah.

2325
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:09,640
Oh my God.

2326
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,510
But this guy has got another dog now
and he's back playing football and

2327
01:04:12,511 --> 01:04:14,760
everyone's called because
he's an athlete and you know,

2328
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:15,810
that's not,

2329
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,190
that's not a normal human being.

2330
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:18,323
That's not,

2331
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:18,900
you know,

2332
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,560
I,

2333
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,171
I agree.

2334
01:04:20,171 --> 01:04:21,900
It's not a regular calculation to make.

2335
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:22,201
Well,

2336
01:04:22,201 --> 01:04:22,671
it's also,

2337
01:04:22,671 --> 01:04:25,140
it's when do you forgive?

2338
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,030
There's certain things
that we don't forgive.

2339
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:27,420
Right.

2340
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:27,811
I mean,

2341
01:04:27,811 --> 01:04:29,340
we don't forgive Charlamagne's thing.

2342
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:31,140
No one forgets that when,

2343
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,150
when a person wants to rape kids,

2344
01:04:33,151 --> 01:04:35,480
like you're off the menu for civilization.

2345
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,440
Pretty much universal.

2346
01:04:36,441 --> 01:04:37,170
Yeah.

2347
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:38,460
But when you,

2348
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,540
when you look at what some
people are willing to accept,

2349
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,820
when it's clearly that's,

2350
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:49,230
there's like a sociopathic
characteristic to that.

2351
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:49,651
There's,

2352
01:04:49,651 --> 01:04:51,450
there's a cruelty characteristic.

2353
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:54,150
But can a guy I learned
from that we know we don't,

2354
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:56,310
they can't learn from childbirth.

2355
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,203
They can't,

2356
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,430
there's the recidivism
rate is way too high.

2357
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:00,211
Whatever it is.

2358
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:01,044
It's way too sick.

2359
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:03,240
The danger that they
pose is way too great.

2360
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:04,920
It's like there's too much at stake.

2361
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:09,700
But the idea is like a guy that used
to treat dogs like their shit and kill

2362
01:05:09,701 --> 01:05:10,440
them.

2363
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,300
Should we give that guy a second chance?

2364
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,870
But the thing is I don't think he can
change his opinion on his actions.

2365
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:16,590
All I can,

2366
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:18,450
all I can think you can do is realize

2367
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:20,280
that other people don't
find that acceptable.

2368
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,001
Well yeah,

2369
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:21,511
there's that.

2370
01:05:21,511 --> 01:05:22,890
But there's also that he,

2371
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,490
um,

2372
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:24,301
his culture,

2373
01:05:24,301 --> 01:05:25,320
like he grew up,

2374
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:26,680
like when he,

2375
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:28,080
from the time he was a little boy,

2376
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,700
like they had dog fights.

2377
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:34,050
Like there's a lot of people in this
world today that's still engage in like

2378
01:05:34,051 --> 01:05:35,350
really regular dogfights.

2379
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,090
Yeah.

2380
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:40,230
And if you are unlucky enough
to be born in that environment,

2381
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:42,450
when do you make your
own moral distinction?

2382
01:05:42,451 --> 01:05:45,000
Like when do you realize that
this is a terrible thing?

2383
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:47,010
But even so there's dog
fighting and Doug fine.

2384
01:05:47,011 --> 01:05:48,390
I mean like if you read,

2385
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:49,110
uh,

2386
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:50,160
Psalm Sheridan's book,

2387
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:50,350
uh,

2388
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:51,230
fights is heart.

2389
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,220
There's a bit about dog
fighting in there and they say,

2390
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:53,630
I mean,

2391
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:54,480
I don't agree with it,

2392
01:05:54,481 --> 01:05:54,991
but it's a very,

2393
01:05:54,991 --> 01:05:56,160
very different perspective.

2394
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:56,671
You know,

2395
01:05:56,671 --> 01:05:57,540
that care for the dogs,

2396
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:58,291
they look after them,

2397
01:05:58,291 --> 01:06:00,870
they buy them the best food and you know,

2398
01:06:00,871 --> 01:06:01,740
really take care of them.

2399
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,360
And the dogs fight for fairness,

2400
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:03,730
you know?

2401
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,563
Right.

2402
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:05,341
Which I mean,

2403
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:07,110
it's still a kind of
an unusual perspective,

2404
01:06:07,111 --> 01:06:07,350
but,

2405
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:09,570
but the stuff that Vic
was doing was just evil,

2406
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,433
evil,

2407
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:11,940
which is a whole new level entirely.

2408
01:06:11,941 --> 01:06:13,290
And that's the kind of stuff that you,

2409
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:14,124
that you can't,

2410
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,380
you can't heal from either thing.

2411
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:15,730
That's,

2412
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:16,770
that's the person that he is.

2413
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,630
I met him once and I
didn't know who he was.

2414
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:19,711
I met him backstage.

2415
01:06:19,711 --> 01:06:20,280
I'm glad I went.

2416
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,710
I don't meet him now because I don't,

2417
01:06:22,711 --> 01:06:24,090
I don't know that I'd want
to be anywhere near him.

2418
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:24,821
I,

2419
01:06:24,821 --> 01:06:25,654
it just,

2420
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:26,813
you know,

2421
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:28,260
how'd you feel when you met him?

2422
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,300
I didn't know who he was.

2423
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:31,020
He's just,

2424
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:31,853
yeah.

2425
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:35,470
When my friend confronted him
about what he'd done to the dogs,

2426
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:39,450
he said he was hoping for some kind of
like aggressive reaction like he was

2427
01:06:39,451 --> 01:06:39,640
going,

2428
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,740
he was hoping that the guy,

2429
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,050
that the guy was at least going
to have a feeling about it.

2430
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:43,861
He said,

2431
01:06:43,861 --> 01:06:44,250
but when,

2432
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,960
whatever he was telling the guy,

2433
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,940
whatever he was talking
to Michael Vick about,

2434
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:48,960
Vic was just like,

2435
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:50,933
just,

2436
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:51,540
just not,

2437
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:51,781
not,

2438
01:06:51,781 --> 01:06:52,830
they're just not present,

2439
01:06:52,831 --> 01:06:53,101
you know,

2440
01:06:53,101 --> 01:06:53,670
he's just,

2441
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:55,050
it didn't understand what was going on.

2442
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:56,430
Not a very smart guy.

2443
01:06:56,431 --> 01:06:57,264
Just,

2444
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,073
you know.

2445
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:01,980
Have you seen the Charles
Ramsey nine one one call?

2446
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:02,341
I heard.

2447
01:07:02,341 --> 01:07:03,360
That's just terrifying.

2448
01:07:03,361 --> 01:07:05,220
Somebody just sent it to me with captions.

2449
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:05,761
Yeah,

2450
01:07:05,761 --> 01:07:06,091
sure.

2451
01:07:06,091 --> 01:07:06,924
Throw it up.

2452
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:11,310
What you're about to hear is e nine one
one call placed by hero Charles Ramsey

2453
01:07:11,311 --> 01:07:15,090
after he found a man to marry a woman
who had been kidnapped for the past

2454
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:15,240
decade.

2455
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,710
This man saved her life.

2456
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,800
5:52 PM 34 seconds.

2457
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:24,180
May Six two zero one
Cleveland mellow one police,

2458
01:07:24,181 --> 01:07:25,110
ambulance or fire,

2459
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:26,220
Bro.

2460
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:29,160
I'm 73 more with,

2461
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:30,281
hey,

2462
01:07:30,281 --> 01:07:30,990
check this out.

2463
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:32,170
I just came from Mcdonald's,

2464
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:32,640
right?

2465
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:32,810
No,

2466
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:34,350
my mom for cheating my little food.

2467
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:35,184
Right.

2468
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:38,280
It's trying to work out the fucking house.

2469
01:07:38,281 --> 01:07:39,810

2473
01:07:47,971 --> 01:07:49,970

Linda Berry or some shit.

2474
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,330

2475
01:07:51,331 --> 01:07:52,130

2476
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:52,963

2479
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:59,830
than the street Seymour Avenue.

2480
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,410
Is she still in the street
or where did she go?

2481
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:03,430
I'm looking at it.

2482
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:06,790

2484
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,120
She wiped with the baby looking.

2485
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:10,630
Scanning.

2486
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:10,841
Okay.

2487
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:11,674
What is she wearing?

2488
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,860
A white tank top like blue,

2489
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:15,500

2490
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,520

2491
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:17,900

2492
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:18,800
like a wife beater.

2493
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:20,890
Did you know the address next door does?

2494
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,450
She says she was in here.

2495
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,070
I'm looking at it.

2496
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:24,420
Okay.

2497
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:25,550
I thought that was your address.

2498
01:08:25,551 --> 01:08:27,650
So that Damn Bro,

2499
01:08:27,651 --> 01:08:28,484
I'm telling you.

2500
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:31,530
[inaudible]

2501
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:33,563
sorry mate.

2502
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:34,983
Why?

2503
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:37,063
What's the phone number?

2504
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:40,021
Okay.

2505
01:08:40,021 --> 01:08:41,280
Does any justice in the world?

2506
01:08:41,281 --> 01:08:45,810
This guy becomes fucking huge
and Kim Kardashians and I'm sure

2507
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,333
this is real.

2508
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:51,540
Can you ask her,

2509
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,860
this is a real guy.

2510
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:03,770
We'll send the police out.

2511
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,460
That guy's a bad motherfucker.

2512
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,620
I got to get him on the podcast.

2513
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:09,880
It's like,

2514
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,713
yeah we do.

2515
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:13,780
President is amazing.

2516
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:14,621
That's a real man.

2517
01:09:14,621 --> 01:09:16,030
So he was breaking into that place.

2518
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,680
I was coming from it and there
was somebody trying to break out

2519
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,980
of the house like we should
like punching through a window

2520
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:27,671
or I don't know.

2521
01:09:27,671 --> 01:09:31,030
So she climbed out somehow somehow
or another she got out of whatever.

2522
01:09:31,031 --> 01:09:33,190
They had a locked her up and wow.

2523
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:34,660
Crazy shit man.

2524
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:38,290
10 fucking years and thinking that's
going to be the rest of your life having

2525
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:39,550
these guys just fuck you.

2526
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:43,030
Hold you down to fuck you every
night and feed you fucking oatmeal.

2527
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,383
Oh,

2528
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,360
some rundown house in Cleveland.

2529
01:09:46,361 --> 01:09:47,740
You're a sex slave for
the rest of your life.

2530
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:48,700
You do with those guys.

2531
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:49,803
Kill him.

2532
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:50,673
You got to kill him.

2533
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:52,930
They just got to remove
them from the gene pool.

2534
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:53,170
But,

2535
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:54,160
but then you think there's something,

2536
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:56,860
kind of send a story about
like laying Suni down on the,

2537
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,030
on a,

2538
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:00,320
on a bed and injecting
them into light light.

2539
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:01,120
Put them,

2540
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:01,810
put them down.

2541
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:02,680
I don't think it's necessarily,

2542
01:10:02,681 --> 01:10:04,120
I think you just dig a hole,

2543
01:10:04,121 --> 01:10:04,870
shoot him in the head,

2544
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:05,703
push him in the hole.

2545
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:08,290
I really don't think you need to
be fucking with all this injection.

2546
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,210
So clinically it makes it scary,

2547
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,170
but that's what they're trying to do,

2548
01:10:11,171 --> 01:10:12,880
but they're trying to do is take the uh,

2549
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,400
the chaos out of murder.

2550
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:15,940
Yeah.

2551
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:18,360
They're trying to take
all the variables out.

2552
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:20,380
Let's can do a nice
and easy little poison.

2553
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:20,620
Hey,

2554
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:21,120
go.

2555
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:21,953
Hey Dad,

2556
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:22,983
goodbye.

2557
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:23,920
Take care.

2558
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,370
That's it.

2559
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:25,180
That's a wrap.

2560
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,350
Instead of just shooting someone,

2561
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:27,040
you know,

2562
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:27,281
I mean,

2563
01:10:27,281 --> 01:10:28,840
did you ever see that
movie dead man walking?

2564
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:29,813
No.

2565
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:31,210
Sean Penn's a bad motherfucker.

2566
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:31,741
I mean that,

2567
01:10:31,741 --> 01:10:33,790
that guy knows how to act as ass off.

2568
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:34,630
He's a crazy dude,

2569
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:36,460
but he knows how to act as his ass off.

2570
01:10:36,461 --> 01:10:38,850
And he played this guy that was dying.

2571
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:39,370
He's going,

2572
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:40,690
going in for lethal injection.

2573
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:43,600
And the way he played it was so real.

2574
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,030
Like you really thought
he was gonna fucking die.

2575
01:10:46,031 --> 01:10:48,730
And that's all avoidable man.

2576
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:49,990
All that craziness.

2577
01:10:49,991 --> 01:10:53,950
A strapping that guy and it freaking them
out and injecting him so that you can

2578
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,784
feel better.

2579
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:58,840
Just shoot him and the fact and
head and let's be done with this.

2580
01:10:58,900 --> 01:10:59,440
Okay.

2581
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,370
It's real simple.

2582
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,960
That's a bad person.

2583
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:02,830
He's broken.

2584
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,120
We got to get rid of them.

2585
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:05,163
Shoot them.

2586
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:05,441
Okay.

2587
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:06,274
There we go.

2588
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,050
Like they do on the walking dead.

2589
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:11,110
I think they should be put them in
a trough first at like a Skinner,

2590
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,890
the concert and we all get to like
piss on them for it or something,

2591
01:11:13,891 --> 01:11:13,980
you

2592
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,101
know,

2593
01:11:14,101 --> 01:11:15,510
like something cool like that first.

2594
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:16,373
That's not cool.

2595
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:17,970
That's just weird.

2596
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:18,841
Yeah,

2597
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:19,690
it was pissed off.

2598
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:21,180
Hey,

2599
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:21,931
what do you want to do today?

2600
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:22,621
So I'm cool.

2601
01:11:22,621 --> 01:11:23,490
It's beside each other.

2602
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,070
So tell me about your
journey in the jungle.

2603
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:32,701
Okay.

2604
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:33,071
What was the,

2605
01:11:33,071 --> 01:11:33,780
was that all about?

2606
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:34,613
What happened?

2607
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,570
What caused you to want to do this?

2608
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:37,950
I don't really know.

2609
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:39,301
I don't really know.

2610
01:11:39,301 --> 01:11:39,840
I just felt,

2611
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,850
I felt like I was drawn to it.

2612
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,713
Um,

2613
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:43,280
I was,

2614
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,370
I was speaking to a friend of mine,

2615
01:11:44,371 --> 01:11:44,941
I won't mention him,

2616
01:11:44,941 --> 01:11:45,810
but he's under the fighter.

2617
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:47,070
I'm retired now.

2618
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:47,860
Uh,

2619
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:48,190
and,

2620
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:50,130
and he did a couple of
ceremonies in London,

2621
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,660
a friend's place.

2622
01:11:51,661 --> 01:11:52,980
They brought a sham it over and,

2623
01:11:52,981 --> 01:11:53,280
uh,

2624
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:53,781
did a couple of,

2625
01:11:53,781 --> 01:11:57,240
and I've always been kind of the guy
that if I wanted to experience something,

2626
01:11:57,241 --> 01:11:58,260
I would go to the source.

2627
01:11:58,261 --> 01:11:58,680
You know what I mean?

2628
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,220
I would like,

2629
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,840
like if I wanted to do kung feel,

2630
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:02,600
I go to China and if I want to rest,

2631
01:12:02,601 --> 01:12:04,350
I come to America and you know,

2632
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:06,450
if I want to try Ios guy I go to Peru.

2633
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:07,530
It just kind of made sense.

2634
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:08,364
So,

2635
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:09,383
um,

2636
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,900
it was kind of like my reward
for getting through the Catlin,

2637
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:14,160
the Duane Ludwig camp,

2638
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:15,450
because that was obviously,

2639
01:12:15,451 --> 01:12:16,110
you know,

2640
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:20,820
that would have been a loss in a row
and obviously a complete changing career

2641
01:12:20,821 --> 01:12:21,654
paths.

2642
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,440
Um,

2643
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,271
so I just kind of,

2644
01:12:23,271 --> 01:12:23,431
you know,

2645
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:25,970
I put 12 weeks aside to
dedicate myself to that fight.

2646
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:27,570
And you know,

2647
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:28,381
with that as a,

2648
01:12:28,381 --> 01:12:30,420
as a reward after in a couple
of days after the fight,

2649
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,000
I flew out and spent two weeks there,

2650
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:38,090
did a tobacco ceremony on the first day
three Ios because ceremonies and to San

2651
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:39,893
Pedro ceremonies,

2652
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:43,950
how's that tea ceremony?

2653
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,280
They basically make a drink of uh,

2654
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:47,941
tobacco,

2655
01:12:47,941 --> 01:12:52,620
coffee and sugar and they cook it up and
then you drink a whole load of it and

2656
01:12:52,621 --> 01:12:53,311
it's like a purge,

2657
01:12:53,311 --> 01:12:54,150
like a detox.

2658
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:56,220
Like if you've got any kind
of toxins in your system,

2659
01:12:56,221 --> 01:13:00,270
you throw up when you sweat and some
people will crying and obviously there's

2660
01:13:00,271 --> 01:13:02,250
all kinds of other nasty
stuff that goes on as well.

2661
01:13:02,251 --> 01:13:02,810
But,

2662
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:03,430
um,

2663
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,791
it's just,

2664
01:13:03,791 --> 01:13:04,080
it's,

2665
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,800
it's a way of like cleansing your body
before the Ios go theoretical cleansing

2666
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:09,240
or does it actually
have a cleansing effect?

2667
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:10,050
It's got a client,

2668
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:11,170
fortunately had been in,

2669
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,420
in training camp for 12 weeks,

2670
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:13,980
so I'd been on a clean diet and I just,

2671
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:15,520
I just kept my diet clean until I've,

2672
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:18,330
I've got to Peru because
there's a special diet for,

2673
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,700
for the ios because it's a low,

2674
01:13:20,701 --> 01:13:21,980
a acidic diet,

2675
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:22,814
right?

2676
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:24,571
Sugar,

2677
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:25,590
no oils,

2678
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:26,791
no sex,

2679
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:27,660
no spices,

2680
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:28,621
oils,

2681
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:29,454
oils,

2682
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:31,410
oils.

2683
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:32,243
I don't know.

2684
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:32,881
I don't know.

2685
01:13:32,881 --> 01:13:33,110
I,

2686
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:33,700
it's interesting.

2687
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,410
Yeah,

2688
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,460
there are a lot of things,

2689
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:39,420
a lot of things on the list that I'm
Kinda on the fence about and it's kind of,

2690
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,210
it's weird because there's not
really any kind of science behind it.

2691
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:42,361
I mean,

2692
01:13:42,361 --> 01:13:45,810
there are some things that you can't
have because they react badly with the,

2693
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:46,520
with,

2694
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,311
with the medicine.

2695
01:13:47,311 --> 01:13:47,670
But,

2696
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:48,480
uh,

2697
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,160
some of the foods are kind of kind of odd.

2698
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,200
I just kind of go on instinct when I'm,

2699
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,390
when I'm dieting for it right now.

2700
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:56,520
So the tobacco ceremony,

2701
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:57,870
there's no psychoactive effect,

2702
01:13:57,871 --> 01:13:58,704
no nothing.

2703
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:59,720
It's just like,

2704
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,910
it's just like smoking three packets of
cigarettes and drinking six Starbucks

2705
01:14:02,911 --> 01:14:03,744
all at the same time.

2706
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:05,930
It sounds like the future of Syria.

2707
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:08,430
I don't drink coffee.

2708
01:14:08,431 --> 01:14:10,320
I don't drink caffeine or
obviously smoke cigarettes.

2709
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:11,154
So I'm like,

2710
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:14,920
I'm like sitting in my room
like shaking and sweating.

2711
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:16,840
It was kind of uncomfortable.

2712
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:18,461
But once that was over,

2713
01:14:18,461 --> 01:14:19,171
the next day was,

2714
01:14:19,171 --> 01:14:22,510
was the first ios because homeowner and
I did feel real sharp the next morning.

2715
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:23,403
I felt very,

2716
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:24,363
very alone.

2717
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,031
Okay.

2718
01:14:25,031 --> 01:14:27,180
So the next morning you
do the ILS get ceremony.

2719
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,083
What was that like?

2720
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:28,570
Uh,

2721
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:32,530
well you don't need a great deal of during
the day we had a light breakfast and

2722
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:32,980
then,

2723
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:33,251
uh,

2724
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:33,590
you know,

2725
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:33,910
like a,

2726
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:37,660
like a fruit snack around mid day and
then after that you fast and the ceremony

2727
01:14:37,661 --> 01:14:38,620
starts to 8:00 PM.

2728
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:39,790
Um,

2729
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:42,580
so the idea is that you go into
the ceremony with intentions,

2730
01:14:42,581 --> 01:14:43,510
that things that you wanted,

2731
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:44,310
uh,

2732
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:45,550
question questions you want to ask.

2733
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:46,783
Um,

2734
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:47,540
there's,

2735
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:48,790
there's always this talk about,

2736
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:48,950
uh,

2737
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:49,390
about,

2738
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:49,750
uh,

2739
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,200
ios because the spirit of Ios,

2740
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:51,730
Sca,

2741
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:55,870
mother I Alaska and some people during
their experiences have an interaction

2742
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,660
with a female entity of some
point that was of some sort,

2743
01:14:58,661 --> 01:14:59,494
but I didn't,

2744
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,140
but uh,

2745
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,880
but the intentions are
still very important.

2746
01:15:03,881 --> 01:15:05,290
Going into the ceremony with,

2747
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:05,890
uh,

2748
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:06,101
you know,

2749
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:09,730
with questions about myself
or my life or whatever,

2750
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:11,200
really for me,

2751
01:15:11,201 --> 01:15:14,280
the answer's just Kinda
just kinda manifested.

2752
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,220
It just kind of show up.

2753
01:15:15,221 --> 01:15:18,190
I just kind of all of a sudden
getting an overwhelming feeling of,

2754
01:15:18,191 --> 01:15:18,431
of,

2755
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:19,264
of the right,

2756
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:20,763
the right answer.

2757
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:22,600
I don't really know how to
explain it better than that.

2758
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,790
It's kind of the problem is
that I really feel like we've,

2759
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:27,550
we've not got the language to explain
this kind of stuff at the moment.

2760
01:15:27,551 --> 01:15:28,360
We need,

2761
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,440
we need to expand it,

2762
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:30,730
our vocabulary to,

2763
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:32,320
to encompass all the,

2764
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:32,920
you know,

2765
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,960
all the stuff that we were
experiencing these things.

2766
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:35,351
Yeah.

2767
01:15:35,351 --> 01:15:39,730
There's a lot of people believe
that what a psychedelic states,

2768
01:15:39,731 --> 01:15:43,420
even if they don't believe in that you're
really contacting the spirit world,

2769
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:47,210
what they think you're doing
by forcing yourself to,

2770
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:49,720
to take a hard look at yourself and,

2771
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:49,991
uh,

2772
01:15:49,991 --> 01:15:52,690
address some questions that you
might have one way or another.

2773
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:57,010
But to do it with this stuff
that absorb it absolves your ego.

2774
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:58,330
It removes the ego.

2775
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,800
And in doing that,

2776
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:02,590
it's a rare state that you get to
get the fuck away from your ego,

2777
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:06,430
but it really lets you get away from it
to a point where you can see things so

2778
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:07,270
much more clearly.

2779
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:07,690
Yeah.

2780
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:11,260
And you can realize how much of the
ego is just been really been sort of

2781
01:16:11,261 --> 01:16:15,580
tricking you and deceiving you and
making you believe that you're,

2782
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,030
you know,

2783
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,860
you're either something that you're not,

2784
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:21,100
or you've gone further than
you really actually have,

2785
01:16:21,101 --> 01:16:25,250
or your ego is allowed you to
sort of delude yourself to,

2786
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:26,021
to get by.

2787
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:27,850
That's very strenuous existence.

2788
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:30,850
And when you go into a psychedelic state,

2789
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:33,760
it allows you to bypass
all that and see it.

2790
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:34,480
And it doesn't,

2791
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:34,781
you know,

2792
01:16:34,781 --> 01:16:36,070
that that's where like,

2793
01:16:36,071 --> 01:16:40,900
people don't understand that you can
get to a mild psychedelic state from

2794
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:41,980
exercise and yoga.

2795
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:42,883
Yeah.

2796
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:43,341
I mean,

2797
01:16:43,341 --> 01:16:43,970
fasting,

2798
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:44,280
yeah.

2799
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,800
Meditation and yeah,

2800
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:49,140
you can get there just to
sensory deprivation tanks.

2801
01:16:49,141 --> 01:16:51,630
You can get to a pretty extreme
form with no drugs at all.

2802
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:57,380
But the IOWASCA ceremony is basically
known as prior the grand mall of a,

2803
01:16:59,551 --> 01:17:01,110
of the psychedelic experiences,

2804
01:17:01,111 --> 01:17:04,140
the most spiritual of the
psychedelic experiences.

2805
01:17:04,141 --> 01:17:04,580
Yeah.

2806
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:08,090
It's pretty powerful in comparison to
other things after I've experienced this.

2807
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:09,830
Have you ever experienced the,

2808
01:17:09,831 --> 01:17:10,060
the

2809
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,380
raw form of DMT?

2810
01:17:11,381 --> 01:17:11,920
Yeah.

2811
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,753
Only once though.

2812
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:16,270
Was it five Meo DMT or was it an DMT?

2813
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,313
Uh,

2814
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:18,430
there's two different kinds.

2815
01:17:18,431 --> 01:17:19,264
One,

2816
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:19,960
okay.

2817
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,040
Five meo yeah,

2818
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,750
five Erminio is quite a bit different.

2819
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:23,040
Yeah,

2820
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:23,560
it's a,

2821
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,550
there's no visuals.

2822
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:27,790
It's a very intense feeling
of connection and it's very,

2823
01:17:27,791 --> 01:17:28,624
very potent.

2824
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:29,231
In fact,

2825
01:17:29,231 --> 01:17:31,300
I think it's like supposedly,

2826
01:17:31,301 --> 01:17:33,040
obviously I'm not some
sort of a scientist here,

2827
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:33,520
but a,

2828
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:38,290
supposedly it's even more powerful
gram per gram than DMT is.

2829
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:39,880
But the DMT,

2830
01:17:39,881 --> 01:17:40,571
the NMD,

2831
01:17:40,571 --> 01:17:40,930
mts,

2832
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:42,200
what you're getting in the IOWASCA.

2833
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:43,120
Okay.

2834
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:43,931
When you eat it,

2835
01:17:43,931 --> 01:17:45,610
if you tried to eat DMT,

2836
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,020
there's a stomach,

2837
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:47,770
uh,

2838
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:48,820
chemical produced your,

2839
01:17:48,821 --> 01:17:49,440
your,

2840
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,100
your chemical,

2841
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:53,530
your stomach produces something
called Mano aimeen oxidase apparently.

2842
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,440
And that breaks down DMT.

2843
01:17:56,770 --> 01:18:00,580
So with these brilliant people that live
in the Amazon and figured out how to do

2844
01:18:00,581 --> 01:18:05,581
it was mixed the vine of one plant with
the leaves of another and cook it all

2845
01:18:06,011 --> 01:18:06,370
together.

2846
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:10,530
So they introduced a natural Mao
inhibitor that not blow your mind.

2847
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:11,860
It's insane.

2848
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,670
Plays in mind.

2849
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:16,570
Did you ask them how they figured it
out and not Terence Mckenna did and he,

2850
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:19,150
he said that they always said
that the plants how to do it.

2851
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:20,480
But you know,

2852
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,890
I've always thought about this with diet,

2853
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:22,700
like,

2854
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:25,880
like people who have been combining
like incomplete proteins for years,

2855
01:18:25,881 --> 01:18:28,580
like milk and cereal and
rice and beans and not,

2856
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:29,960
not knowing that those,

2857
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:32,060
those two things combined
made a complete protein.

2858
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:34,280
So why would they combine them?

2859
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:35,600
Yeah,

2860
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:36,051
it's funny,

2861
01:18:36,051 --> 01:18:36,231
right?

2862
01:18:36,231 --> 01:18:36,830
I mean it's like,

2863
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:37,171
it's nice.

2864
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:38,390
It's like an odd coincidence.

2865
01:18:38,391 --> 01:18:41,390
But I will ask is like the same
thing but a way more extreme.

2866
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:41,830
Well,

2867
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:42,790
there's a lot of folks

2868
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:43,211
bully,

2869
01:18:43,211 --> 01:18:44,290
I shouldn't say a lot of folks,

2870
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:45,610
but it's been speculated.

2871
01:18:45,611 --> 01:18:46,090
I've read,

2872
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:46,923
uh,

2873
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:52,080
read work where people believe that
what we've created with civilization and

2874
01:18:52,451 --> 01:18:54,160
with societies and uh,

2875
01:18:54,161 --> 01:18:59,161
especially with like modern
societies where there's like mass,

2876
01:18:59,591 --> 01:19:00,160
uh,

2877
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,630
speed communication.

2878
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:05,110
It's like people are sending each other
text messages and watching television,

2879
01:19:05,111 --> 01:19:10,111
all these is that we're missing out key
information that is there in nature.

2880
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:12,160
And that literally,

2881
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:13,900
if you're in a natural state,

2882
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:18,640
like if you're living in a natural
state and you're away from the,

2883
01:19:18,641 --> 01:19:18,941
the,

2884
01:19:18,941 --> 01:19:23,500
the distractions and the madness
of the fucking civilized world,

2885
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:28,680
that there's literally a signal that
you can't quite pick up anymore.

2886
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:34,110
And that signal is like a guide to get
through life at like the earth literally

2887
01:19:35,681 --> 01:19:36,610
does talk to.

2888
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,110
Is that the collective consciousness,

2889
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:38,620
do you think?

2890
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:39,101
I Dunno.

2891
01:19:39,101 --> 01:19:39,341
I mean,

2892
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:42,310
I don't know if I believe that it ever
really was the kid of the case that

2893
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:45,490
people were much more sensitive
to the language of the earth.

2894
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:46,810
It is possible.

2895
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:51,820
I think it's really hard to even wrap our
heads around what it must've been like

2896
01:19:51,821 --> 01:19:52,600
before they were lying,

2897
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,910
which I know all the toxins that we've,

2898
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:56,080
that we've produced as well.

2899
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:58,660
All the things that we've been to
introduce to our diet until our bodies,

2900
01:19:59,290 --> 01:19:59,710
like,

2901
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:01,870
like the dashboard on my truck outside,

2902
01:20:01,871 --> 01:20:02,890
he's killing me slowly.

2903
01:20:02,891 --> 01:20:03,311
You know what I mean?

2904
01:20:03,311 --> 01:20:04,091
That's the kind of stuff.

2905
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:04,301
Yeah,

2906
01:20:04,301 --> 01:20:04,481
it's,

2907
01:20:04,481 --> 01:20:04,661
you know,

2908
01:20:04,661 --> 01:20:05,410
they had met them,

2909
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:07,630
met all kinds of chemicals and you know,

2910
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:07,980
like,

2911
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,050
like fluoride is,

2912
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:13,590
as people are now starting to
understand fluoride is bad for you.

2913
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:15,240
Well how many is that?

2914
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:15,420
Yeah.

2915
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:17,760
Calcifies your pineal gland supposedly.

2916
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,830
I don't know if there's
ever been any real studies.

2917
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,380
I have a feeling that might be
something that someone just said once.

2918
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:23,370
Everybody just repeats.

2919
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:24,750
I can take it out and I don't mind.

2920
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:25,921
Well,

2921
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:26,460
it's,

2922
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:30,060
I don't think there's necessarily a
lot of evidence that it's good for you

2923
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:30,901
think,

2924
01:20:30,901 --> 01:20:31,170
uh,

2925
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:34,800
people say that there's a connection
between putting fluoride in the water and

2926
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:36,030
removing tooth decay.

2927
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:40,800
But that also coincided with
education about brushing.

2928
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:41,610
I mean,

2929
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:42,030
the other,

2930
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:44,520
that shit went down when people
realize that you have to brush,

2931
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,480
you know,

2932
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,130
and then putting fluoride in your teeth,

2933
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:48,870
brush in your toothpaste.

2934
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,400
Apparently that's not so good either.

2935
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:51,720
Even though you don't eat it,

2936
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:52,391
it's still,

2937
01:20:52,391 --> 01:20:55,850
it's like there's a reason why you
don't swallow that stuff once you like.

2938
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:56,680
She like,

2939
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:57,090
yeah.

2940
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,490
Famous in the foam it up in your mind.

2941
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,370
Drinking water though.

2942
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,293
Yeah.

2943
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,350
Fucking it's crazy.

2944
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,313
Yeah,

2945
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:04,110
but why do we still do it though?

2946
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:05,360
I don't know.

2947
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,180
That's pretty awesome.

2948
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:10,560
So I'm sure that some grants scheme that
send me a tweet about and I'll spend

2949
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:12,090
the next four hours festering over it.

2950
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:13,290
What else?

2951
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:14,970
I think these are things
that are potentially like,

2952
01:21:14,971 --> 01:21:15,490
you know,

2953
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:17,070
like keeping as disconnected from,

2954
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,920
from this whatever we're missing
out on this language that we're,

2955
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,090
that we're missing out on front of the,

2956
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,160
maybe it's possible,

2957
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:25,300
but I think that if you were living
in the jungle and you needed,

2958
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:26,453
you know,

2959
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:29,310
you needed to survive there and
it is possible that you would eat,

2960
01:21:29,311 --> 01:21:32,880
least have an idea of mixing these
two things together and cooking them.

2961
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:33,830
Yeah,

2962
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:36,090
but you imagine if you
found out you were right,

2963
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,010
like when you created Iowasca me,

2964
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,690
if the dude just nailed it the first time,

2965
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,190
like let's see what we got here.

2966
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:41,910
It takes a sip.

2967
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:42,460
Yeah.

2968
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:42,761
Do,

2969
01:21:42,761 --> 01:21:42,971
do,

2970
01:21:42,971 --> 01:21:43,201
do,

2971
01:21:43,201 --> 01:21:44,034
do,

2972
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:45,421
do doom,

2973
01:21:45,421 --> 01:21:45,871
doom,

2974
01:21:45,871 --> 01:21:46,590
doom.

2975
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:47,460
He must've been like,

2976
01:21:47,461 --> 01:21:48,031
God damn,

2977
01:21:48,031 --> 01:21:49,110
did I knock it out of the park?

2978
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,700
Well the fuck your vegetable soup.

2979
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,600
I got some shit.

2980
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,630
It will kick your Dick
right into the dirt sign.

2981
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,510
But look at the guy that
found that the discovered LSD.

2982
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:58,111
Yeah.

2983
01:21:58,111 --> 01:21:58,680
Albert Hoffman.

2984
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,160
Yeah.

2985
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,540
Like completely complete accident.

2986
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:03,430
And not only that and he like rode
home and thought he was going mad

2987
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:06,613
bicycle.

2988
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,210
First LSD trip ever.

2989
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:13,290
And then didn't you go back a couple of
days later and said like it like five

2990
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:14,670
times the amount or something?

2991
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:15,720
I don't know.

2992
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:21,080
I think the initial amount he took was
way higher than like a normal dose.

2993
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:22,650
It's like a bucket.

2994
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:26,850
I think it came in through
his fingers I think because,

2995
01:22:26,851 --> 01:22:27,180
um,

2996
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,280
that's the thing about acid,

2997
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,940
it'll go right through your skin.

2998
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:31,020
Yeah.

2999
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:31,820
Had that happened.

3000
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:34,980
That's exciting for the first time,

3001
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:39,600
the first dude to figure out
Iowasca how long ago was that?

3002
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:42,330
They'd say it's at least 2000 years.

3003
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,251
They say they've,

3004
01:22:43,251 --> 01:22:43,650
they've,

3005
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:48,650
they've shown like archeological evidence
of Iowasca use up to 2000 years ago.

3006
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:49,770
How do you even,

3007
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:50,190
I mean,

3008
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:51,870
I can't make sense of it now and I have,

3009
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:52,340
you know,

3010
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:52,500
uh,

3011
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,333
much more,

3012
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:53,751
uh,

3013
01:22:53,751 --> 01:22:56,210
a much better understanding
of the universe and you know,

3014
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:56,570
as,

3015
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:58,080
as obviously it's science knows it,

3016
01:22:58,081 --> 01:23:00,920
but like back then when all you know is,

3017
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:05,970
is the jungle and the plants around
you and how would you even begin

3018
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:06,900
to make sense of that?

3019
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:08,670
How would you begin to make sense of that?

3020
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:09,271
Yeah.

3021
01:23:09,271 --> 01:23:10,104
How would you,

3022
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,850
and then how do you become an expert,

3023
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:12,240
uh,

3024
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,440
introducing that to other people,

3025
01:23:13,441 --> 01:23:14,274
like a shaman,

3026
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,720
which I find really fascinating.

3027
01:23:15,721 --> 01:23:16,710
The idea of shamanism.

3028
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:18,290
It's very fascinating.

3029
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:21,050
You know why it's fascinating because
you've experienced it and you know,

3030
01:23:21,051 --> 01:23:23,540
it's real to a joke.

3031
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:26,750
Construction worker lunchbox that's
listening to this nonsense right now.

3032
01:23:26,930 --> 01:23:27,171
You know,

3033
01:23:27,171 --> 01:23:28,800
I like that Joe Rogan podcasts,

3034
01:23:28,801 --> 01:23:32,860
but every now and then they go off
the fucking tin foil hat deepened.

3035
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:36,860
And this guy's talking about journey
into the spirit world that I want to be a

3036
01:23:36,861 --> 01:23:39,290
Shama and get the fuck outta here.

3037
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,430
Tell me a joke.

3038
01:23:40,431 --> 01:23:41,241
Ass face.

3039
01:23:41,241 --> 01:23:41,601
Okay.

3040
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:42,381
That's what you're here for.

3041
01:23:42,381 --> 01:23:43,130
Your fuck.

3042
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:44,750
That guy is a black belt under Matt Serra.

3043
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:49,003
Possibly.

3044
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:49,911
Possibly.

3045
01:23:49,911 --> 01:23:50,744
Well done.

3046
01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:51,621
Yeah.

3047
01:23:51,621 --> 01:23:51,950
The,

3048
01:23:51,950 --> 01:23:52,550
um,

3049
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:53,081
the,

3050
01:23:53,081 --> 01:23:53,181
the,

3051
01:23:53,181 --> 01:23:53,661
you know,

3052
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:55,070
it's real that you've done it,

3053
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:56,180
you've experienced it and it's,

3054
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:57,440
it's not just real,

3055
01:23:57,770 --> 01:24:01,310
it's real in a way where you
feel sorry for people who haven't

3056
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:02,670
great first it because if,

3057
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:02,970
but,

3058
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:03,803
but at the same time I,

3059
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:04,290
you know,

3060
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:04,650
when I,

3061
01:24:04,650 --> 01:24:06,930
when I first came back from
Peru and people were asking me,

3062
01:24:06,931 --> 01:24:07,470
you know,

3063
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:09,110
is this something that
everyone should experience?

3064
01:24:09,111 --> 01:24:12,120
I was saying yes to everybody
but now I'm not so sure.

3065
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:15,420
I think there are like I was walking
through the looks side of the day and you

3066
01:24:15,421 --> 01:24:16,254
know,

3067
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:19,770
God bless America and all the people
that were pumping money into those slots

3068
01:24:19,771 --> 01:24:21,810
and smoking cigarettes and drinking beers,

3069
01:24:21,811 --> 01:24:23,850
but they need a lot of,

3070
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,840
they need to a lot of self
discovery without an altered
state before there would

3071
01:24:26,841 --> 01:24:27,720
be even ready for that.

3072
01:24:27,721 --> 01:24:29,460
Like if you took them
and gave him my Alaska,

3073
01:24:29,461 --> 01:24:31,050
it would ruin them forever.

3074
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:32,070
Maybe,

3075
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:32,970
maybe this,

3076
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:33,560
you know,

3077
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,490
maybe just seeing them at their worst.

3078
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,680
Maybe they would say that about
you if they caught you beaten off.

3079
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:38,780
Well maybe you know,

3080
01:24:38,781 --> 01:24:42,840
you're there and your I's
cross your tongue out and like,

3081
01:24:42,841 --> 01:24:43,021
yeah,

3082
01:24:43,021 --> 01:24:44,250
this guy really needs a fucking,

3083
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:45,270
I lost this seminar.

3084
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,220
You need to get your own life together,

3085
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:47,640
son.

3086
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:48,473
Yeah they would,

3087
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,620
they would come down on you.

3088
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:50,521
But it's Kinda,

3089
01:24:50,521 --> 01:24:53,590
it's Kinda weird because like the
people that find their way to it a light

3090
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:57,030
already in a place in their life
where they're kind of prepared for it,

3091
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,193
you know,

3092
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,430
that that happens a lot of the time.

3093
01:25:00,431 --> 01:25:03,310
But I'm not completely convinced
that happens all the time.

3094
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:06,820
I've definitely heard of people having
bad experiences or going there when they

3095
01:25:06,821 --> 01:25:07,631
weren't ready for it.

3096
01:25:07,631 --> 01:25:08,110
Yeah.

3097
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:11,530
I think psychedelic experiences
are incredibly powerful.

3098
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:16,620
And to say that people should or shouldn't
do it is equally foolish because to

3099
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:18,250
say that someone should do it,

3100
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:18,581
it's like,

3101
01:25:18,581 --> 01:25:20,410
how the fuck do you know
that guy should do at what?

3102
01:25:20,411 --> 01:25:21,940
Cause you did it and you like it.

3103
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,210
Yeah,

3104
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:24,350
I agree with that.

3105
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:25,050
I just think,

3106
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:25,883
you know,

3107
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:27,771
it's just,

3108
01:25:27,771 --> 01:25:30,410
it's a lot to process for
someone that's open minded.

3109
01:25:30,411 --> 01:25:30,680
Right.

3110
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:34,460
So for someone that is buying
into the Oprah call and you know,

3111
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:35,691
hope it's bad ass,

3112
01:25:35,691 --> 01:25:35,931
dude,

3113
01:25:35,931 --> 01:25:36,710
don't get me wrong,

3114
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:37,580
don't get it twisted.

3115
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,340
[inaudible] I'd like to take over to Peru.

3116
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:44,360
We need to do we need to get
Oprah and bring her to the jungle?

3117
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:44,900
Yeah,

3118
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:45,950
I think this is the way forward.

3119
01:25:45,951 --> 01:25:48,590
I think this is how we move to the next
stage of our evolution is we've got to

3120
01:25:48,591 --> 01:25:49,490
start getting some of these,

3121
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:53,120
these power people and taking them out
there and I think it's really happening.

3122
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:55,190
We haven't heard about it at all yet.

3123
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,040
I hope so.

3124
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:56,490
Listen,

3125
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:57,060
there's,

3126
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,850
if there really are people
and they really are,

3127
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,000
that really do have a massive amount of
power in this world and they really do

3128
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:03,740
eat,

3129
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:06,350
you don't think that they've
wanted to look into that.

3130
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:08,270
Like why would you not
want to look in that?

3131
01:26:08,271 --> 01:26:09,800
If there's anything
that can freak you out.

3132
01:26:09,801 --> 01:26:11,120
If you were in the build the Berger Group,

3133
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,240
you mother fuckers
sitting around and do it.

3134
01:26:14,241 --> 01:26:19,241
Iowasca talking to the the great serpent
as it breaks down your life and the

3135
01:26:19,281 --> 01:26:23,210
kind of damage that you're
doing to society and
civilization and how unnecessary

3136
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:24,650
it is and how you're still unhappy,

3137
01:26:24,651 --> 01:26:25,880
even though you're doing it,

3138
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,040
even though you're manipulating the banks,

3139
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:30,410
controlling the resources of the world,

3140
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:35,150
instigating wars overseas and profiting
off of it and some strange fucking shell

3141
01:26:35,151 --> 01:26:36,800
game that nobody completely understands.

3142
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:38,450
You're still not happy bitch.

3143
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:39,740
And that's what it would tell you.

3144
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,900
It would be good for everybody.

3145
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:42,561
But what'd you think?

3146
01:26:42,561 --> 01:26:42,981
What you think?

3147
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:44,480
If you've got the Bilderberg into us,

3148
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:44,760
Sarah,

3149
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:48,260
into ceremony and I think they all need
to realize that you don't need that much

3150
01:26:48,261 --> 01:26:50,030
money at fuck crazy.

3151
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,360
You're going crazy asshole.

3152
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:52,940
You got caught up in your own game.

3153
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:53,350
Isn't it?

3154
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:55,850
Got to the point where you're controlling
the world's economy and you're worth

3155
01:26:55,851 --> 01:26:56,390
billions.

3156
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:57,171
What are you doing?

3157
01:26:57,171 --> 01:26:58,010
You don't need billions.

3158
01:26:58,011 --> 01:26:58,701
That's stupid,

3159
01:26:58,701 --> 01:26:59,330
man.

3160
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:00,163
That's dumb.

3161
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:05,170
You can have a nice house and food and
not worry about shit for way less and

3162
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:09,650
never have to worry about a single
thing for the rest of your life.

3163
01:27:09,651 --> 01:27:13,310
Like you're in some crazy stratosphere
that no one reaches and you're still

3164
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:14,300
trying to make more money.

3165
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:15,710
He's still trying to fuck people over.

3166
01:27:15,711 --> 01:27:16,820
You're a sick fuck.

3167
01:27:16,821 --> 01:27:17,450
You're sick.

3168
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:17,870
Yeah.

3169
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:22,870
Cause obviously broken the very stupid
too because you could be having a great

3170
01:27:23,301 --> 01:27:25,970
fucking time every day
for the rest of your life.

3171
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:29,780
If I had billions of dollars
every day would be fishing.

3172
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:32,180
I would fucking go fly kites.

3173
01:27:32,181 --> 01:27:32,530
I would,

3174
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:33,790
I would do traveled to it.

3175
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,850
Today we're going to Hawaii.

3176
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:35,811
Who gives a fuck?

3177
01:27:35,811 --> 01:27:39,520
You've got $100 million in the
bank like you're in instead.

3178
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:39,981
What are you doing?

3179
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:41,390
You're trying to fuck over Portugal.

3180
01:27:41,391 --> 01:27:42,340
You're trying to steal,

3181
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,450
steal oil out of the Amazon.

3182
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:44,831
What do,

3183
01:27:44,831 --> 01:27:45,021
yeah.

3184
01:27:45,021 --> 01:27:45,860
What are you trying to do?

3185
01:27:45,861 --> 01:27:48,410
What he tried to your here
fucking cutting up the world.

3186
01:27:48,411 --> 01:27:48,800
Yeah.

3187
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,820
It's not necessary,

3188
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:52,520
but they don't know any better because
they're caught up just like those same

3189
01:27:52,521 --> 01:27:53,960
people at the casino though,

3190
01:27:53,961 --> 01:27:55,220
those people are caught up to,

3191
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:59,630
they're caught up in like a hitch and
the human mind that allows you to try to

3192
01:27:59,631 --> 01:28:04,631
solve puzzles and seek conclusions and
you're good and you just hijack that shit

3193
01:28:05,061 --> 01:28:05,871
with three lemons.

3194
01:28:05,871 --> 01:28:06,350
Come on,

3195
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:06,520
get,

3196
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:06,831
fuck.

3197
01:28:06,831 --> 01:28:10,370
I could find the three lemons there in
there and then your brain gets locked in

3198
01:28:10,371 --> 01:28:11,960
this stupid thing and then the cigarettes,

3199
01:28:11,961 --> 01:28:16,370
you're suck on these cigarettes that
these same people extracting millions of

3200
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:20,090
dollars from the society by feeding
people these poisonous fucking,

3201
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:25,120
we'd filled tubes that you light on
fire and you poison yourself and I went

3202
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:26,090
slow.

3203
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:27,410
They give him the drugs to fix it.

3204
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:27,840
Yeah,

3205
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:28,461
lots of play.

3206
01:28:28,461 --> 01:28:29,320
I've got plenty of shit to.

3207
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:29,900
I would,

3208
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:30,150
you know,

3209
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:32,390
basically they're not cancer of the
boxes in the next couple of years.

3210
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,180
You have to whereby Mr. Johnson
just keep fucking smoking away.

3211
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,433
It's a,

3212
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,320
we live in a mad world.

3213
01:28:39,321 --> 01:28:39,771
We live,

3214
01:28:39,771 --> 01:28:44,771
we live in a world that should be a
movie and nowhere is that more readily

3215
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:48,890
available or honest then when you
have a psychedelic experience,

3216
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:54,100
because when you see what mushrooms can
do or we could see what DMT could do and

3217
01:28:55,071 --> 01:28:57,710
whether it's an io Wasco
or regular form you,

3218
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:58,820
you s you realize like,

3219
01:28:58,821 --> 01:28:59,030
wow,

3220
01:28:59,030 --> 01:29:01,680
there really is like a magic in the world.

3221
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:07,070
And it sounds so stupid that
if you haven't experienced it,

3222
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,513
you really would.

3223
01:29:08,530 --> 01:29:09,420
And even people,

3224
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:10,980
even people who have experienced it,

3225
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:13,650
they don't want to describe it that way
cause you don't want to sound stupid to

3226
01:29:13,651 --> 01:29:14,910
people haven't experienced it.

3227
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:15,511
So they'll go,

3228
01:29:15,511 --> 01:29:15,691
look,

3229
01:29:15,691 --> 01:29:16,770
it's nothing magic.

3230
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:17,221
Your,

3231
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:20,490
your cerebral cortex gets
flooded with chemicals.

3232
01:29:20,491 --> 01:29:23,220
You're the visual aspect of your
interpretation of the world around you.

3233
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:23,461
It gets,

3234
01:29:23,461 --> 01:29:23,790
hey,

3235
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:25,410
hijacked by these,

3236
01:29:25,411 --> 01:29:25,740
uh,

3237
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:27,720
new chemicals and it just fucking give it.

3238
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:29,033
Maybe,

3239
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:30,443
maybe,

3240
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:32,670
or maybe you haven't done it yet.

3241
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:34,200
And if you have done it,

3242
01:29:34,230 --> 01:29:35,700
maybe just cynical.

3243
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,160
Maybe you're missing out
on what the fuck that is.

3244
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:39,780
That's the magic fairy dust pitch.

3245
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,280
You get to go to a fairy land.

3246
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:45,010
But I do find that I can't speak as
openly with people that haven't had that

3247
01:29:45,011 --> 01:29:45,970
experience anymore.

3248
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:47,210
Crazy.

3249
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:47,741
Exactly.

3250
01:29:47,741 --> 01:29:48,574
Yeah.

3251
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:51,370
I say I say energy a lot
more than they used to.

3252
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,480
I say powerful a lot.

3253
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:54,763
Good.

3254
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:55,751
It's a good thing to say.

3255
01:29:55,751 --> 01:29:56,980
I have a lot of power days now.

3256
01:29:57,710 --> 01:29:59,200
Like sometimes I'll get standard down,

3257
01:29:59,201 --> 01:29:59,531
I'd be like,

3258
01:29:59,531 --> 01:29:59,680
Yep,

3259
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:00,401
that was a power day.

3260
01:30:00,401 --> 01:30:02,610
Like I'll be out in the
valley of fire and you know,

3261
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:04,150
swimming in lake mead
and stuff and it's like,

3262
01:30:04,151 --> 01:30:04,510
yeah,

3263
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:05,180
what's your a with,

3264
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:06,460
what's your Kale count per day?

3265
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:06,950
Oh,

3266
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:07,090
it's,

3267
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:07,960
it's ridiculous.

3268
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:13,291
Yeah.

3269
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:13,770
Um,

3270
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:15,180
but thinking that way,

3271
01:30:15,181 --> 01:30:16,700
like being powerful and,

3272
01:30:16,701 --> 01:30:18,330
and thinking positively,

3273
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:22,140
that really does change your fucking
life and people don't understand that.

3274
01:30:22,141 --> 01:30:23,220
Like it is silly.

3275
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:23,611
Yeah.

3276
01:30:23,611 --> 01:30:24,600
It definitely seems silly.

3277
01:30:24,601 --> 01:30:25,260
It sits.

3278
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:29,430
If you're a serious person who's
a conservative man who's not,

3279
01:30:29,431 --> 01:30:31,140
and not to be mocked and laughed at,

3280
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:33,330
he wouldn't engage in
Chester such behaviors,

3281
01:30:33,331 --> 01:30:35,700
but life itself is silly.

3282
01:30:35,790 --> 01:30:36,690
The whole thing is silly.

3283
01:30:36,691 --> 01:30:38,250
The whole thing is completely ridiculous,

3284
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:39,250
you know?

3285
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:43,950
So if he did not to be worried
about looking stupid by trying that,

3286
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:45,863
yeah.

3287
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,070
It's the whole,

3288
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:47,520
the whole,

3289
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,070
my whole perspective
of life changed though.

3290
01:30:49,071 --> 01:30:49,190
I,

3291
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:51,450
I quite liked the temporariness of it now.

3292
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:52,471
Yeah.

3293
01:30:52,471 --> 01:30:52,860
Because,

3294
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:55,140
because this is the space
that I always experienced,

3295
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:56,160
you know,

3296
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:57,900
with the Ios Ska and you know,

3297
01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:02,250
other psychedelic like DMT or psilocybin.

3298
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,510
I always feel like,

3299
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:04,741
like the place,

3300
01:31:04,741 --> 01:31:07,860
our reach when I've had the
right kind of amount is,

3301
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:08,940
is a very familiar,

3302
01:31:08,941 --> 01:31:09,774
safe place.

3303
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:12,270
I've been there hundreds of times before.

3304
01:31:12,271 --> 01:31:12,570
It's like,

3305
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:12,811
oh,

3306
01:31:12,811 --> 01:31:13,321
I'm back.

3307
01:31:13,321 --> 01:31:13,530
Yeah.

3308
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:15,840
Isn't that the weirdest
thing about it is really odd.

3309
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,900
The weirdest thing about it is how
it feels so comfortable and so,

3310
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:20,400
so normal.

3311
01:31:20,401 --> 01:31:21,990
It feels so familiar.

3312
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:22,560
Yeah.

3313
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:22,890
I think,

3314
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:24,400
I think woman described it in the,

3315
01:31:24,401 --> 01:31:24,901
the DMT,

3316
01:31:24,901 --> 01:31:27,360
but the spirit molecule book
a doctor Rick Strassman,

3317
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:28,000
she said,

3318
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:28,440
um,

3319
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:31,260
it feels like a waiting room
between death and birth,

3320
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,960
which I thought was kind of
an interesting perspective.

3321
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:34,620
Wow.

3322
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:35,340
I remember my knees,

3323
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:37,800
my latest psychedelic
trip that it was like,

3324
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:38,790
just like that where I'm like,

3325
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:39,870
I've been here before,

3326
01:31:39,871 --> 01:31:41,070
why can't I remember this?

3327
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:41,611
Like,

3328
01:31:41,611 --> 01:31:43,200
it seems like I do that a lot,

3329
01:31:43,201 --> 01:31:45,330
like go to the same place so many times.

3330
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:46,051
Yeah.

3331
01:31:46,051 --> 01:31:46,680
Well,

3332
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:47,760
what would be a part of your brain,

3333
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:48,020
right.

3334
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:48,650
It could,

3335
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:49,030
it's,

3336
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:52,370
it's so close to normal
human neuro chemistry.

3337
01:31:52,371 --> 01:31:53,720
The most profound ones,

3338
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:54,470
they're all,

3339
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:58,550
they're so close to normal shit
you bring produces like mushrooms,

3340
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:02,420
mushrooms and DMT or like very closely
combined are very closely related to

3341
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:04,900
chemicals and DMT is
produced by your brain.

3342
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:07,240
So all of those experiences are just,

3343
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:11,860
they know exactly where to hit in
your mind to produce this stuff.

3344
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:13,900
Can't think that that's a coincidence.

3345
01:32:13,901 --> 01:32:16,060
I can't think that that's all an accident.

3346
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:16,570
No,

3347
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:16,730
I,

3348
01:32:16,730 --> 01:32:17,480
I like,

3349
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,060
I like Terence Mckenna's theory on,

3350
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:19,871
on the introduction,

3351
01:32:19,871 --> 01:32:21,790
this other side of it into the human diet.

3352
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:22,280
Yeah.

3353
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,113
When we became,

3354
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:23,590
uh,

3355
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:24,010
you know,

3356
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:28,040
from the canopy dwelling fruity taste
to the plain dwelling kind of forages.

3357
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:28,390
Um,

3358
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:32,070
I don't know if that holds up
scientifically as far as the timeline,

3359
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:33,131
but no,

3360
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:36,280
I've never heard anyone say
anything more plausible.

3361
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:36,640
No,

3362
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:39,760
there's no real serious explanation.

3363
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:41,830
It was a huge leap in consciousness,

3364
01:32:41,831 --> 01:32:43,570
a doubling of the human brain size.

3365
01:32:43,571 --> 01:32:47,500
We were a period of 2 million years and
apparently that's the greatest mystery

3366
01:32:47,501 --> 01:32:49,030
in the entire fossil record.

3367
01:32:49,470 --> 01:32:50,410
I've always wanted to,

3368
01:32:50,430 --> 01:32:53,710
to have a real light dose of mushrooms
and fight like a grandma or grandma and a

3369
01:32:53,711 --> 01:32:55,690
half and fight and fight.

3370
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:56,320
Yeah.

3371
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:56,681
Yeah.

3372
01:32:56,681 --> 01:32:56,831
Well,

3373
01:32:56,831 --> 01:32:57,071
you know,

3374
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:59,560
I know people who've played pool
with it and they say they can't miss.

3375
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:02,050
They say they know where
the ball is at all times.

3376
01:33:02,051 --> 01:33:04,720
They feel it moving on the table
in three dimensional space.

3377
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:05,290
Wow.

3378
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:05,471
Yeah.

3379
01:33:05,471 --> 01:33:09,640
Guys used to play pool on a small amounts
of acid too and like have the best

3380
01:33:09,641 --> 01:33:10,474
game of their life.

3381
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:11,321
I mean,

3382
01:33:11,321 --> 01:33:12,910
what a waste waste of LSD.

3383
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:14,590
You know,

3384
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:16,960
I guess you'd want to be
doing something creative,

3385
01:33:16,961 --> 01:33:18,640
but if you were a series pool player,

3386
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:21,760
like that's apparently the way to
get really awesome series pool.

3387
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:22,300
Plenty.

3388
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:23,200
I played a lot pool.

3389
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:23,501
Yeah.

3390
01:33:23,501 --> 01:33:24,334
For Real.

3391
01:33:24,370 --> 01:33:27,130
But he's not as a job though.

3392
01:33:27,131 --> 01:33:29,800
Like you don't do it like I
would play professionally.

3393
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:30,840
Showback golf though.

3394
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:31,030
I mean,

3395
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:31,241
no,

3396
01:33:31,241 --> 01:33:31,690
no.

3397
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:33,400
Golf is first of all golf.

3398
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:34,780
You're out there walking
around in the rain.

3399
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:35,643
That's retarded.

3400
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:36,060
And,

3401
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:36,280
uh,

3402
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:36,821
second of all,

3403
01:33:36,821 --> 01:33:38,590
he chasing a ball around pool.

3404
01:33:38,591 --> 01:33:42,400
It's all on this one table
that the environment is
exactly the same every time.

3405
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:44,620
You're not dealing with holes and roles.

3406
01:33:44,621 --> 01:33:46,630
And I bet I would love golf,

3407
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:50,140
but I'm terrified of trying it and
finding out that I love and predictable.

3408
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:51,070
So much work.

3409
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:54,970
You're out there eight hours a day chasing
a fucking ball and when you play 18

3410
01:33:54,971 --> 01:33:55,301
holes,

3411
01:33:55,301 --> 01:33:57,010
like that's several
hours worth of playing,

3412
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:58,790
drinking that Joe that's,

3413
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,410
did you enjoy it more with LSD?

3414
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:06,720
Bill Murray didn't Cag shot it wasn't
that as thing wasn't it taken acid and

3415
01:34:07,271 --> 01:34:08,104
play golf?

3416
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:09,311
It's been so long.

3417
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:10,570
I know that people have done it.

3418
01:34:10,630 --> 01:34:10,990
Yeah.

3419
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:13,840
It gives you more sensitivity apparently.

3420
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:15,910
More spacial recognition,

3421
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:16,750
more uh,

3422
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:18,460
understanding of distance deception.

3423
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:18,851
Yeah.

3424
01:34:18,851 --> 01:34:22,600
And the depth perception and apparently
in a way that really you'd never,

3425
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:24,220
you never see this field.

3426
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,270
Medical scientists and
Silva's secrets every time.

3427
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,193
Fights.

3428
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:30,431
Yeah.

3429
01:34:30,431 --> 01:34:31,420
Could you imagine if he,

3430
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:31,721
well,

3431
01:34:31,721 --> 01:34:32,171
you know,

3432
01:34:32,171 --> 01:34:32,711
steroids,

3433
01:34:32,711 --> 01:34:34,690
but you tested positive for mushrooms.

3434
01:34:34,691 --> 01:34:35,770
You fuck like Jesus.

3435
01:34:35,771 --> 01:34:36,604
What are you doing?

3436
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:39,460
Fighting how much it should be a
separate belt for that entirely.

3437
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:39,641
Well,

3438
01:34:39,641 --> 01:34:41,090
there was a baseball player,

3439
01:34:41,091 --> 01:34:44,530
a famous baseball player who pitched
a no hitter while I was on acid.

3440
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:45,460
Yeah.

3441
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:46,000
Who was that?

3442
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,833
Do you know what it is?

3443
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:47,943
Hold on.

3444
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:49,653
I'll pull it up.

3445
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:50,540
No,

3446
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:51,430
hit her on acid.

3447
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,250
It was not during the seven days and uh,

3448
01:34:54,670 --> 01:34:58,430
apparently what happened was he wasn't
supposed be pitching dock Ellis.

3449
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,530
He wasn't supposed to
be pitching that day.

3450
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:01,820
So he's decided to get lit up,

3451
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:04,740
take some acid and then
like something happened.

3452
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:08,810
They called him in and he had to go
play and he said he was just fine.

3453
01:35:08,811 --> 01:35:10,070
Heinie pitch a no hitter.

3454
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:11,991
See,

3455
01:35:11,991 --> 01:35:14,390
I'd love to have lived through those
days of sport instead of these.

3456
01:35:14,391 --> 01:35:15,650
Now these are two regulators,

3457
01:35:15,651 --> 01:35:16,190
you know?

3458
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:16,491
Yeah.

3459
01:35:16,491 --> 01:35:17,420
Let's go back to those,

3460
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,790
the those like 1960s and seventies.

3461
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:21,400
Those were crazy days.

3462
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:22,660
But you can't go back.

3463
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:23,140
No,

3464
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:27,130
they're going to be looking back at this
day thinking how crazy we were as well.

3465
01:35:27,670 --> 01:35:29,200
I often think of all the
things that are going to,

3466
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:30,670
we're going to look back on even when I'm,

3467
01:35:30,671 --> 01:35:31,840
or when I'm going to
look back and be like,

3468
01:35:31,841 --> 01:35:32,081
wow,

3469
01:35:32,081 --> 01:35:32,914
we actually did that.

3470
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:33,340
Like,

3471
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:35,530
like I remember I smoked like
people smoking on planes.

3472
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:36,161
Yes,

3473
01:35:36,161 --> 01:35:36,760
I remember that.

3474
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:37,320
That's crazy.

3475
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:37,500
Yeah.

3476
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,333
It's crazy.

3477
01:35:40,050 --> 01:35:41,950
Like even like I live in Vegas now,

3478
01:35:41,951 --> 01:35:43,000
walk into the casino and I'm like,

3479
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:43,420
oh,

3480
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:44,440
there's smoke everywhere.

3481
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:47,620
It's like two years ago that
people stop smoking in the UK.

3482
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:48,491
Oh yeah.

3483
01:35:48,491 --> 01:35:50,830
Well I've immediately made
the adjustment though.

3484
01:35:50,831 --> 01:35:51,461
So like in,

3485
01:35:51,461 --> 01:35:53,200
in like 30 or 40 years time,

3486
01:35:53,201 --> 01:35:55,060
like when I'm on a plane and we're like,

3487
01:35:55,061 --> 01:35:55,780
you know,

3488
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:57,370
I can't even imagine
what it would be like,

3489
01:35:57,371 --> 01:35:59,920
but we're going to look back at
sort of like Delta and be like,

3490
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:01,593
hell no.

3491
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:02,830
I can't believe I ever did that.

3492
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:04,450
I lost my bags.

3493
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:05,230
I was,

3494
01:36:05,230 --> 01:36:07,450
I was stuck between two
fat guys sweating on me,

3495
01:36:07,451 --> 01:36:07,840
you know?

3496
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:08,160
Yeah.

3497
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,150
The definitely,

3498
01:36:09,151 --> 01:36:09,391
yeah.

3499
01:36:09,391 --> 01:36:10,610
With this kind of be one day.

3500
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:12,630
I'm sure there's going to
be a better version of that,

3501
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:13,171
but the,

3502
01:36:13,171 --> 01:36:15,420
the smoking and the sky's
the most ridiculous one.

3503
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:19,290
Or when you like nurses and dentists
could like smoke while they're actually

3504
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:21,861
working on your team.

3505
01:36:21,861 --> 01:36:23,490
Fifties movies and shit.

3506
01:36:23,491 --> 01:36:24,324
Yeah.

3507
01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:24,630
Yeah.

3508
01:36:24,630 --> 01:36:25,470
Everyone smoked.

3509
01:36:25,471 --> 01:36:28,020
I was watching the invasion of
the body snatchers seal the day,

3510
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:29,100
the old version,

3511
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:32,670
fucking doctors sitting there lighten
up in the middle of a doctor's

3512
01:36:32,671 --> 01:36:33,470
appointment.

3513
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:35,760
You're definitely talking too
much about cigarettes today.

3514
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:38,460
I'm the freaking out junkie.

3515
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:40,163
He's hooked.

3516
01:36:40,350 --> 01:36:41,101
But yeah.

3517
01:36:41,101 --> 01:36:41,461
The,

3518
01:36:41,461 --> 01:36:42,090
um,

3519
01:36:42,090 --> 01:36:43,290
do you think that,

3520
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:44,360
I mean,

3521
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:45,930
it sounds like a crazy thing to say,

3522
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,910
but do you think that
I'm open to the future?

3523
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:49,913
I'm sure you are.

3524
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,520
Do you think that the future of the world,

3525
01:36:53,550 --> 01:36:54,390
like I

3526
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:00,600
do think that it really depends on how
many people have psychedelic experiences

3527
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:02,490
like that.

3528
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:08,060
We need to tip the numbers in that
direction in order for it to get,

3529
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:08,650
uh,

3530
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:09,060
just a,

3531
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:13,890
a large percentage of people that are
at least willing to question the way the

3532
01:37:13,891 --> 01:37:14,970
whole thing is built,

3533
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,300
at least willing to question the
way they're living their own lives,

3534
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:21,180
at least willing to question
what it is we're doing here.

3535
01:37:21,330 --> 01:37:22,610
What are we doing exactly?

3536
01:37:22,890 --> 01:37:24,600
Moving on momentum every day.

3537
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:26,760
Getting up when your alarm clock goes off,

3538
01:37:26,761 --> 01:37:27,660
what the fuck are we doing?

3539
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:28,840
But we were running on,

3540
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:30,460
like Terence Mckenna would say,

3541
01:37:30,461 --> 01:37:32,490
an operating system and the
one that we're in nones,

3542
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:33,161
prehistoric,

3543
01:37:33,161 --> 01:37:33,341
you know,

3544
01:37:33,341 --> 01:37:34,780
everyone's trying to control each other.

3545
01:37:34,990 --> 01:37:36,910
Everyone's jealous of what
everybody else has gotten.

3546
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:38,440
We really need to get past that.

3547
01:37:38,441 --> 01:37:40,030
Realize that I don't need to be jealous.

3548
01:37:40,031 --> 01:37:41,420
So what anyone else has got because I'm,

3549
01:37:41,530 --> 01:37:42,550
I'm good with what I've got,

3550
01:37:42,551 --> 01:37:42,761
you know,

3551
01:37:42,761 --> 01:37:44,920
and just kind of,

3552
01:37:45,370 --> 01:37:45,800
I dunno,

3553
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,230
people are not finding peace,

3554
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:49,840
so they're surround himself with
things that they think make them happy.

3555
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:52,920
We haven't been aware for very long.

3556
01:37:52,921 --> 01:37:53,110
No,

3557
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:54,460
I think that's a real problem.

3558
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:59,200
I think that human race is in the middle
of waking up and trying to figure out

3559
01:37:59,201 --> 01:38:03,250
what the fuck it did to get here
and what it can do moving forward.

3560
01:38:03,251 --> 01:38:06,310
And right now we're still operating
on what it did to get here.

3561
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:10,840
We're still operating on the ripples of
the affects of everything that's gone on

3562
01:38:10,841 --> 01:38:11,674
in the past.

3563
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:13,690
And so when you say something like that,

3564
01:38:13,691 --> 01:38:14,111
like yeah,

3565
01:38:14,111 --> 01:38:16,040
I mean people need to do psychedelics.

3566
01:38:16,150 --> 01:38:18,040
They just immediately dismiss you.

3567
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:21,160
Like you're all all this crazy
fuck like listening to him.

3568
01:38:21,161 --> 01:38:21,400
Yeah.

3569
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:22,840
People need to do drugs.

3570
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:23,141
Yeah.

3571
01:38:23,141 --> 01:38:23,980
That's what they need to do.

3572
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:25,240
Dan Hardee they needed,

3573
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:26,570
but the thing,

3574
01:38:26,570 --> 01:38:27,590
the thing is I don't think,

3575
01:38:27,650 --> 01:38:30,290
I don't think the focus should be
what it has to be psychedelics.

3576
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:31,170
It's just,

3577
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:33,170
it's just about people
becoming more conscious,

3578
01:38:33,171 --> 01:38:35,090
making conscious decisions and you know,

3579
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:38,330
even when it comes to light diet
and an exercise practice and,

3580
01:38:38,331 --> 01:38:39,164
and uh,

3581
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:39,651
you know,

3582
01:38:39,651 --> 01:38:39,901
just,

3583
01:38:39,901 --> 01:38:43,240
just your approach to people into
relationships to how you would,

3584
01:38:43,310 --> 01:38:44,360
you deal with people,

3585
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:47,210
your impact on the world and you know,

3586
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:49,300
and as soon as more people
start thinking about that,

3587
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:50,540
then we're going to start moving forward.

3588
01:38:50,570 --> 01:38:52,670
I think psychedelics has
just kind of a shortcut,

3589
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:53,601
like,

3590
01:38:53,601 --> 01:38:54,230
you know,

3591
01:38:54,230 --> 01:38:56,150
it just kind of upgrade
you a little bit quicker,

3592
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:57,590
see things a little clearer.

3593
01:38:57,620 --> 01:38:58,160
Like,

3594
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:58,851
like before it,

3595
01:38:58,851 --> 01:38:59,750
before my first,

3596
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:01,280
my first ILS Alaska experience,

3597
01:39:01,670 --> 01:39:04,220
I always felt like I was
in amongst my issues,

3598
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:07,550
like the worst surrounding me and I
couldn't really see clearly I couldn't get

3599
01:39:07,551 --> 01:39:09,020
the pieces in order to put them together.

3600
01:39:09,021 --> 01:39:09,830
Right.

3601
01:39:09,830 --> 01:39:11,870
And as soon as that
first ceremony was over,

3602
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:15,380
I felt like I could step back and look
at all the pieces in front of me and like

3603
01:39:15,381 --> 01:39:16,071
piece things together.

3604
01:39:16,071 --> 01:39:17,360
Almost like everything's a game,

3605
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:18,021
you know?

3606
01:39:18,021 --> 01:39:21,230
And I think that was it to Tom Campbell
you were talking to a while ago.

3607
01:39:21,231 --> 01:39:22,640
There's a video of you and him on,

3608
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:24,170
on Youtube talking.

3609
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:24,740
Um,

3610
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:25,071
and he's,

3611
01:39:25,071 --> 01:39:28,200
he's talking about the idea of a gamble.

3612
01:39:28,550 --> 01:39:29,180
Yeah.

3613
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:30,013
Thomas Campbell

3614
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:32,633
Soup Guy.

3615
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:35,763
I'm sure that's his name.

3616
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:37,861
It was like a total,

3617
01:39:37,861 --> 01:39:39,080
is it about what we were talking about?

3618
01:39:39,110 --> 01:39:39,310
Um,

3619
01:39:39,310 --> 01:39:39,720
you know,

3620
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:40,551
just the idea.

3621
01:39:40,551 --> 01:39:42,170
He's light like the Matrix,

3622
01:39:42,171 --> 01:39:43,100
like it's a video game.

3623
01:39:43,190 --> 01:39:44,023
Like I,

3624
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:44,571
oh,

3625
01:39:44,571 --> 01:39:45,081
I see.

3626
01:39:45,081 --> 01:39:46,040
I think they combined.

3627
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:46,500
Oh,

3628
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:47,060
okay.

3629
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:47,350
Okay.

3630
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:48,350
And some things,

3631
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:49,211
that's a good video.

3632
01:39:49,211 --> 01:39:49,511
Anyway.

3633
01:39:49,511 --> 01:39:50,344
That's a very interesting,

3634
01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:50,791
oh yeah,

3635
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:50,971
yeah,

3636
01:39:50,971 --> 01:39:51,804
that's what it is.

3637
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:53,640
That there's,

3638
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:56,580
there's a lot of people that do these
brilliant kind of animals together.

3639
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:56,761
Yeah.

3640
01:39:56,761 --> 01:39:57,780
They do them on their own.

3641
01:39:57,810 --> 01:39:58,161
No one,

3642
01:39:58,161 --> 01:39:59,100
no one tells him to do it.

3643
01:39:59,130 --> 01:39:59,791
They just do it.

3644
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:01,200
And there's so many of them out there.

3645
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,140
That's incredible.

3646
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:02,850
But like,

3647
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:02,940
I,

3648
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:03,820
I kind of like,

3649
01:40:03,821 --> 01:40:05,030
my approach to life now is,

3650
01:40:05,031 --> 01:40:05,151
is,

3651
01:40:05,151 --> 01:40:06,490
is almost like a video game.

3652
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:07,240
Like,

3653
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:08,950
like I'm constantly trying to level up.

3654
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:10,720
I'm constantly trying to get to the next,

3655
01:40:10,721 --> 01:40:12,430
next stage to try and like,

3656
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:14,140
like forced evolution almost.

3657
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:14,680
Right.

3658
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:15,460
You know,

3659
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:18,520
and I think that like we were
talking about this the day,

3660
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:19,433
um,

3661
01:40:20,410 --> 01:40:21,000
swimming in the,

3662
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:21,790
in the lake,

3663
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:22,560
it's smoking weed,

3664
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:23,020
um,

3665
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:26,260
just kind of hanging out and all of a
sudden it all kind of fell into place for

3666
01:40:26,261 --> 01:40:27,094
me.

3667
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:30,730
Like there were certain people
that that make an effort to,

3668
01:40:30,731 --> 01:40:31,170
to,

3669
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:31,730
to reach,

3670
01:40:31,730 --> 01:40:32,980
reach a higher consciousness,

3671
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:33,400
so that,

3672
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:34,420
so imagine them as like,

3673
01:40:34,421 --> 01:40:35,530
as like bubbles on the table.

3674
01:40:35,531 --> 01:40:38,740
Imagine the tables full of bubbles and
one of those people starts to drift off a

3675
01:40:38,741 --> 01:40:42,550
little quicker and that is going to
create a reaction of the people around it.

3676
01:40:42,551 --> 01:40:44,680
And then they're going to pull up and
occasionally you're going to get like a

3677
01:40:44,681 --> 01:40:49,000
Jim Morrison or a Hendrix or a Martin
Luther King and they just kind of go by

3678
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:50,560
just pop and explode.

3679
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:51,740
But they're cause such a,

3680
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:54,990
such a ripple that they start to
raise everybody else's consciousness.

3681
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:58,080
So I think everybody has a
responsibility to raise their own.

3682
01:40:58,550 --> 01:40:58,830
And,

3683
01:40:58,830 --> 01:40:59,790
and by doing that,

3684
01:41:00,030 --> 01:41:00,690
we're going to,

3685
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:02,130
we're going to affect
the people around us.

3686
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:03,780
That's a g hippie term.

3687
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:04,380
It is.

3688
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:05,310
Raise your consciousness.

3689
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:06,173
It is.

3690
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:07,810
It sounds like I am a filthy hip,

3691
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:10,930
but it sounds like what to do.

3692
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:13,820
Let's say if he's trying to fuck you try,

3693
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:14,161
you know,

3694
01:41:14,161 --> 01:41:18,690
just trying to raise your consciousness
to that a few and I made love brings us

3695
01:41:18,691 --> 01:41:19,524
closer.

3696
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:19,951
Wow,

3697
01:41:19,951 --> 01:41:20,790
that does sound like me.

3698
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:24,391
Listen,

3699
01:41:24,391 --> 01:41:24,960
Dan Harney,

3700
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:25,351
I know,

3701
01:41:25,351 --> 01:41:26,290
I know your tricks on,

3702
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:28,100
um,

3703
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:31,160
but what what you're saying
though I agree with entirely,

3704
01:41:31,161 --> 01:41:32,750
even though it sounds
like dirty hippy talk,

3705
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:36,920
what you're saying is that we have to
kind of realize that the only way to

3706
01:41:36,921 --> 01:41:41,921
really enjoy this life is you got to not
just bring yourself up but bring up the

3707
01:41:44,361 --> 01:41:45,260
people around you.

3708
01:41:45,261 --> 01:41:47,840
And as they rise up it
will rise you up as well.

3709
01:41:47,841 --> 01:41:52,700
And that we really all connected and
it's your ego that keeps you from seeing

3710
01:41:52,701 --> 01:41:57,410
that it's your ego from trying to separate
yourself from all these people that

3711
01:41:57,411 --> 01:41:58,640
are around you and sinking,

3712
01:41:58,641 --> 01:41:59,480
that you're on your own,

3713
01:41:59,481 --> 01:42:00,291
but you're not on your own.

3714
01:42:00,291 --> 01:42:01,124
No one's on their own.

3715
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:01,950
No.

3716
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:02,530
And,

3717
01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:04,780
and I struggled to come to terms
with some things like the weight,

3718
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:05,673
like Michael Vick,

3719
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:06,161
trees,

3720
01:42:06,161 --> 01:42:10,210
animals or like there's a documentary
that's wait a while to go on youtube and I

3721
01:42:10,211 --> 01:42:13,300
apologize for anybody that watched it
because it's the most awful thing I've

3722
01:42:13,301 --> 01:42:13,601
ever seen.

3723
01:42:13,601 --> 01:42:16,190
It's called earthlings
and it's just a video of,

3724
01:42:16,191 --> 01:42:19,690
of of the different ways that
humans use and treat animals.

3725
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,540
And I got to like 26 minutes
and I had to stop watching it.

3726
01:42:22,541 --> 01:42:26,020
It was so difficult and I always struggle
with coming to terms with why that

3727
01:42:26,021 --> 01:42:26,500
happens.

3728
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:27,340
Why is that there?

3729
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:28,361
And,

3730
01:42:28,361 --> 01:42:32,290
and my conclusion is that is that because
it causes me to have a reaction to

3731
01:42:32,291 --> 01:42:33,370
have a feeling about it.

3732
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:34,570
So everybody that sees me,

3733
01:42:34,571 --> 01:42:39,250
every witnesses that will immediately
form an opinion and that defines them a

3734
01:42:39,251 --> 01:42:40,600
little further to themselves.

3735
01:42:40,650 --> 01:42:44,110
W W we have to ask these questions
about how do we feel about that?

3736
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,610
That makes me feel uncomfortable.

3737
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:48,060
I don't think that that's necessary
and I don't want to watch that.

3738
01:42:48,490 --> 01:42:48,980
Well.

3739
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:49,751
You'd also,

3740
01:42:49,751 --> 01:42:51,310
the reason why that exists,

3741
01:42:51,311 --> 01:42:56,311
the reason why those things can happen
is that people are willing to overlook

3742
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:03,360
normal human morals and
values in favor of profits.

3743
01:43:03,590 --> 01:43:04,180
Yeah.

3744
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:04,780
And when,

3745
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:05,531
as soon as your,

3746
01:43:05,531 --> 01:43:05,831
the,

3747
01:43:05,831 --> 01:43:06,611
the numbers,

3748
01:43:06,611 --> 01:43:08,740
the one in the zero become the almighty,

3749
01:43:09,070 --> 01:43:12,880
then you're fucked because then you're
caught up in the wave of ones and Zeros

3750
01:43:12,881 --> 01:43:13,391
yourself.

3751
01:43:13,391 --> 01:43:15,090
You can become just as disposables,

3752
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:15,671
anybody else.

3753
01:43:15,671 --> 01:43:15,851
I mean,

3754
01:43:15,851 --> 01:43:16,610
you should just,

3755
01:43:16,610 --> 01:43:21,610
that alone should get people
recognize that human humanely,

3756
01:43:22,091 --> 01:43:25,060
if you want to like get
through this life humanely,

3757
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:30,180
like you can not only look at the ones
and Zeros because that's everything

3758
01:43:30,191 --> 01:43:31,480
that's fucked up about the world.

3759
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:33,610
Whether it's war,

3760
01:43:33,611 --> 01:43:36,100
whether it's a manipulation
of the markets,

3761
01:43:36,370 --> 01:43:40,550
whether it's controlling and actually all
of it is about ones and zeros percent.

3762
01:43:40,860 --> 01:43:41,330
Yeah.

3763
01:43:41,330 --> 01:43:42,210
And the people that have,

3764
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:43,110
that have built this,

3765
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:44,400
their society around it,

3766
01:43:44,401 --> 01:43:46,440
this operating system
that we function under,

3767
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:48,570
I've of that they've kind of,

3768
01:43:48,571 --> 01:43:51,470
they've kind of corralled into a
position where we don't have to these,

3769
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,250
these decisions.

3770
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:53,930
We don't have to ask
these questions about,

3771
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:54,650
you know,

3772
01:43:54,650 --> 01:43:55,220
it does.

3773
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:56,210
The Hummer that I drive,

3774
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:59,690
drink far too much filled and Hamas
having too much impact on my environment

3775
01:43:59,691 --> 01:44:00,524
around me.

3776
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,180
Am I an asshole for driving it?

3777
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:02,811
You know what I mean?

3778
01:44:02,811 --> 01:44:04,700
It's that kind of people
don't need to ask.

3779
01:44:04,701 --> 01:44:08,480
Then you see this as a man who loves
classic cars and it's a love hate

3780
01:44:08,481 --> 01:44:09,081
relationship.

3781
01:44:09,081 --> 01:44:09,381
I have,

3782
01:44:09,381 --> 01:44:13,580
I have my Pontiac's sitting in the garage
and I drive it probably once a month

3783
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:15,320
and I've been talking about it,

3784
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:18,110
about selling it for a while
and you're going to get a Prius,

3785
01:44:18,111 --> 01:44:18,944
Dan horny.

3786
01:44:21,550 --> 01:44:22,011
I can't,

3787
01:44:22,011 --> 01:44:22,844
I can't do it for you.

3788
01:44:22,970 --> 01:44:23,481
But the thing is,

3789
01:44:23,481 --> 01:44:24,650
the thing that doesn't make any sense,

3790
01:44:24,651 --> 01:44:26,480
Shelby gt five hundreds of new ones,

3791
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:28,070
pretty fucking good on gas.

3792
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:32,300
It turns out a big powerful engine
that's not working very hard.

3793
01:44:32,301 --> 01:44:33,110
It's pretty efficient.

3794
01:44:33,110 --> 01:44:34,230
But the thing is the technology.

3795
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:35,600
Yeah,

3796
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,760
just get the dancing bears
around your belly button.

3797
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:38,663
That's why.

3798
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:39,810
But it's like,

3799
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:40,700
like in the UK,

3800
01:44:40,701 --> 01:44:41,300
I had to,

3801
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:41,761
I had a kid,

3802
01:44:41,761 --> 01:44:44,510
a sponsorship for a while in the UK
and they would give me a new car.

3803
01:44:44,511 --> 01:44:44,771
But Tom,

3804
01:44:44,771 --> 01:44:47,300
I went back to drive and
it was like what a thrill.

3805
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:48,220
But,

3806
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:49,190
but seriously though,

3807
01:44:49,191 --> 01:44:50,810
like it was a 1.6 diesel,

3808
01:44:50,811 --> 01:44:52,250
they call it like 60 miles to the gallon.

3809
01:44:53,170 --> 01:44:53,600
So,

3810
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:57,260
so why is that technology not making it
over to the u s because it's boring as

3811
01:44:57,261 --> 01:44:58,094
fuck to drive.

3812
01:44:58,400 --> 01:44:59,920
There's no soul.

3813
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,350
You can't listen to Prius.

3814
01:45:01,390 --> 01:45:02,570
Leonard Skinner did music,

3815
01:45:02,571 --> 01:45:04,700
we drive around in a Kia diesel.

3816
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:04,981
So,

3817
01:45:04,981 --> 01:45:06,710
so the options are three
hours that gets full.

3818
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:09,110
It doesn't sound right.

3819
01:45:09,111 --> 01:45:10,010
You want to hear the engine,

3820
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:13,420
you want to be able to
shift your own gears,

3821
01:45:13,421 --> 01:45:14,180
son,

3822
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:15,530
all these things that are dying off.

3823
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:17,160
I'd be more that.

3824
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:18,440
But then on the flip side,

3825
01:45:18,441 --> 01:45:18,740
you know,

3826
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:20,420
should I drive a car
that drinks so much fuel?

3827
01:45:20,421 --> 01:45:21,200
So eventually we can,

3828
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,550
we can get through this quicker.

3829
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:24,360
And then the people that
have control of the fuel,

3830
01:45:24,490 --> 01:45:27,170
you will lose that power and
then we can start thinking ahead,

3831
01:45:27,171 --> 01:45:27,690
you know?

3832
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:28,830
And then we need Hamline.

3833
01:45:28,870 --> 01:45:30,830
It's Easel to run our muscle cars.

3834
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:32,620
You know,

3835
01:45:32,650 --> 01:45:33,860
it's a finite resource.

3836
01:45:33,861 --> 01:45:36,320
So maybe we should just get
through it as quickly as possible.

3837
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:38,240
It is a finite resource apparently,

3838
01:45:38,241 --> 01:45:40,010
but I don't understand how that works.

3839
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:41,840
I don't understand how much oil is left.

3840
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:45,860
You know the problem with one of those
controversial subjects like peak oil is

3841
01:45:45,861 --> 01:45:47,300
when you hear those guys talk,

3842
01:45:47,301 --> 01:45:48,680
you don't know who the fuck is wrong.

3843
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:50,630
You know this guy saying,

3844
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:55,690
I read a book called black
gold stranglehold that was
claiming that oil is a re

3845
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,680
repeatably made,

3846
01:45:57,710 --> 01:46:02,710
repeatedly made fluid and
that wells that have gone dry,

3847
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:04,190
if you give them enough time,

3848
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:05,570
they started producing oil again.

3849
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:08,390
The thing is that the only people that
know the real facts of the people that

3850
01:46:08,391 --> 01:46:09,350
are in control anyway,

3851
01:46:09,351 --> 01:46:10,670
so why would they tell us the truth?

3852
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:11,000
Yeah,

3853
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:11,750
I don't know.

3854
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:14,720
I mean the idea that
anybody could own the oil.

3855
01:46:14,810 --> 01:46:15,740
I mean that's ridiculous.

3856
01:46:15,741 --> 01:46:16,411
That's the whole earth.

3857
01:46:16,411 --> 01:46:18,830
You fuck me over there?

3858
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:20,540
And your metal boxes getting his con.

3859
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:21,540
But I'll say this about like,

3860
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:22,520
like Red Rock Canyon.

3861
01:46:22,521 --> 01:46:24,410
Like I go out there hiking
and I'll get there at like,

3862
01:46:24,411 --> 01:46:24,770
you know,

3863
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:26,570
four 50 in the park closes at five.

3864
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:27,711
It's a mountain.

3865
01:46:27,711 --> 01:46:28,670
How does it close?

3866
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:29,673
Yeah.

3867
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:31,731
You know what?

3868
01:46:31,731 --> 01:46:32,361
That's from there.

3869
01:46:32,361 --> 01:46:35,810
They know what they're tired of picking
people's pieces and having people there,

3870
01:46:35,811 --> 01:46:36,261
so listen,

3871
01:46:36,261 --> 01:46:36,800
you fucks.

3872
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:37,850
You can't be,

3873
01:46:37,851 --> 01:46:39,860
can't be out here because it's dangerous.

3874
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:42,470
Too many you dummies get drunk
and fall off cliffs and die.

3875
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:45,320
That's why I think those dummies should
get drunk and fall off cliffs and die.

3876
01:46:45,630 --> 01:46:48,350
That's the way a thin in the hood without
is actually going out and shooting

3877
01:46:48,351 --> 01:46:49,050
people.

3878
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:49,883
You son,

3879
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:51,000
you know there was a,

3880
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:56,130
there was a woman who recently died like
this this week in France and she fell

3881
01:46:56,131 --> 01:46:58,800
from like 900 feet off the top of a cliff.

3882
01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:00,690
By the time they got down to her,

3883
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:02,460
the vultures had already eaten her.

3884
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:04,620
Oh well that saves carrying a back.

3885
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:05,563
Yes.

3886
01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:07,760
That's one way to look at it.

3887
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:09,500
Let's just take all of light.

3888
01:47:09,501 --> 01:47:09,740
You know,

3889
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:11,240
all of the safety precautions that we,

3890
01:47:11,241 --> 01:47:16,070
I'm like fences around like
moving parts and like crossings.

3891
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:19,430
If you can't make it across the
street without getting hit by a car.

3892
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:20,390
Another thing as well.

3893
01:47:20,391 --> 01:47:22,700
And I have a lot of people that disagreed
with me when I spoke about this on

3894
01:47:22,701 --> 01:47:23,534
Twitter,

3895
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:25,880
50 mile an hour zones around schools.

3896
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:26,470
Like if,

3897
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:26,640
if,

3898
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:28,760
if all the time when
when I went I was a kid,

3899
01:47:28,761 --> 01:47:31,580
I grew up around cause move
moving at 50 miles an hour,

3900
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:34,550
why would I ever take them
seriously as a threat?

3901
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:37,991
Like,

3902
01:47:37,991 --> 01:47:42,030
like we need to do things because
these things are fucking dangerous.

3903
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:42,351
Yeah,

3904
01:47:42,351 --> 01:47:43,161
that's totally true.

3905
01:47:43,161 --> 01:47:43,671
So we need to,

3906
01:47:43,671 --> 01:47:45,200
we need to learn to be careful about it,

3907
01:47:45,230 --> 01:47:46,490
but it's all about education.

3908
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:47,400
Yes,

3909
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:48,211
I agree with you.

3910
01:47:48,211 --> 01:47:49,710
But to play devil's advocate,

3911
01:47:49,711 --> 01:47:53,100
there's too many dumb cunts out there
that need a sign that it gives them an

3912
01:47:53,101 --> 01:47:54,240
unreasonable speed limits.

3913
01:47:54,241 --> 01:47:56,760
Just say slow the fuck down
when they were around schools,

3914
01:47:56,910 --> 01:47:59,730
like our friends that we're
talking about speeding and texting,

3915
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:02,430
you can't have a 60 mile an hour speed
limit in front of a school with that

3916
01:48:02,431 --> 01:48:03,121
asshole driving.

3917
01:48:03,121 --> 01:48:03,420
Okay.

3918
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:05,220
Cause someone's little kids
going flying over the hood.

3919
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:09,330
I wouldn't want it to be a little
Dan Hardee and it's an awful thing.

3920
01:48:09,331 --> 01:48:13,200
But the 40 miles now are smart because
kids also are stupid and they tend to

3921
01:48:13,201 --> 01:48:14,880
jump into traffic and that,

3922
01:48:14,890 --> 01:48:15,290
you know,

3923
01:48:15,290 --> 01:48:15,941
oh my lord,

3924
01:48:15,941 --> 01:48:17,570
my piece of paper,

3925
01:48:17,571 --> 01:48:18,051
Shit,

3926
01:48:18,051 --> 01:48:18,710
man,

3927
01:48:18,710 --> 01:48:23,420
I need to fucking pass this class and
they run out into the street and boom,

3928
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:24,710
you got to be able to hit that break.

3929
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:25,573
You fuck

3930
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:27,651
fuck you.

3931
01:48:27,651 --> 01:48:28,484
Oh Man.

3932
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:32,150
I don't ever remember anybody getting
hit by a car outside of school when I was

3933
01:48:32,151 --> 01:48:33,400
a kid and I'm,

3934
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:37,010
we have a 45 mile and at 40 mile
an hour zone outside of my school.

3935
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:39,210
I'm sure somebody did see a
woman get hit by a truck broke

3936
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:39,640
though.

3937
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:40,130
Ooh,

3938
01:48:40,130 --> 01:48:41,510
she got shot at groceries on the,

3939
01:48:41,511 --> 01:48:42,230
on the handle bar.

3940
01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:43,280
Oh my God.

3941
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:44,360
How bad was that?

3942
01:48:44,390 --> 01:48:44,870
Bad.

3943
01:48:44,870 --> 01:48:45,890
Oh Jesus.

3944
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:48,561
Fucking,

3945
01:48:48,561 --> 01:48:49,394
hey man,

3946
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:50,000
I don't,

3947
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:50,960
I don't want to see that,

3948
01:48:50,961 --> 01:48:51,794
but I have,

3949
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:52,970
that's the problem with the Internet.

3950
01:48:52,971 --> 01:48:54,830
I've seen everything at this point.

3951
01:48:54,831 --> 01:48:55,700
You've seen so much.

3952
01:48:55,730 --> 01:48:58,160
If you watched the video of the
monk set himself on fire from,

3953
01:48:58,190 --> 01:48:59,023
yes,

3954
01:48:59,150 --> 01:49:01,190
I spent a day watching
that over and over again.

3955
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:02,210
The one from Vietnam.

3956
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:03,650
How do you,

3957
01:49:03,650 --> 01:49:04,720
how do you prepare yourself?

3958
01:49:04,721 --> 01:49:05,960
I didn't even fucking move.

3959
01:49:06,010 --> 01:49:06,330
No,

3960
01:49:06,330 --> 01:49:07,580
he never like,

3961
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:11,480
he never panicked and he stayed in the
Lotus position and keep taking something

3962
01:49:11,481 --> 01:49:12,110
to numb it.

3963
01:49:12,110 --> 01:49:12,650
Nope.

3964
01:49:12,650 --> 01:49:13,690
I do not believe so.

3965
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:16,360
So if you're going to
light yourself on fire,

3966
01:49:16,370 --> 01:49:17,390
what fucking difference does it make?

3967
01:49:17,391 --> 01:49:18,224
How you doing?

3968
01:49:18,270 --> 01:49:19,101
Light yourself on fire,

3969
01:49:19,101 --> 01:49:19,400
dude.

3970
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:20,630
It's going to get kind of woman to,

3971
01:49:20,810 --> 01:49:21,710
did you see the,

3972
01:49:21,711 --> 01:49:22,040
uh,

3973
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:23,360
the bear eat the monkey?

3974
01:49:23,710 --> 01:49:26,500
None in Hong Kong or Taiwan.

3975
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:26,930
Maybe.

3976
01:49:26,930 --> 01:49:28,910
I forget somewhere in Singapore.

3977
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:30,050
I'm just making shit up now.

3978
01:49:30,170 --> 01:49:31,130
I know where the fuck it happened.

3979
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:33,590
Some in some Asian country,

3980
01:49:33,830 --> 01:49:37,970
there was a carnival show
where a bear was on a bicycle,

3981
01:49:37,971 --> 01:49:38,661
so he would pull it up.

3982
01:49:38,661 --> 01:49:39,494
Jamie,

3983
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:44,330
there's a bear on a bicycle and a monkey
on a bicycle and they're going around

3984
01:49:44,331 --> 01:49:45,680
this ring and this is it.

3985
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:47,230
Pull it way up into the,

3986
01:49:47,231 --> 01:49:48,010
the like the half

3987
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,990
of it into it before the,

3988
01:49:49,991 --> 01:49:51,490
the bear loses his shit.

3989
01:49:51,491 --> 01:49:51,880
Yeah,

3990
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:52,720
right before there.

3991
01:49:52,810 --> 01:49:53,950
So the monkey crap.

3992
01:49:53,951 --> 01:49:54,610
Pull it back.

3993
01:49:54,610 --> 01:49:55,121
Pull it back,

3994
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:55,541
pull it back.

3995
01:49:55,541 --> 01:49:56,051
Pull back,

3996
01:49:56,051 --> 01:49:56,884
pull back.

3997
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:58,240
The monkey,

3998
01:49:58,260 --> 01:49:58,550
uh,

3999
01:49:58,550 --> 01:50:03,370
crashes a bike and the bear crashes
into the monkeys bike when it's on the

4000
01:50:03,371 --> 01:50:05,380
ground and just decides to eat the monkey.

4001
01:50:06,130 --> 01:50:06,551
He's like,

4002
01:50:06,551 --> 01:50:07,120
you know what?

4003
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:08,110
Fuck you.

4004
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:08,891
So watch this.

4005
01:50:08,891 --> 01:50:09,311
Boom.

4006
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:10,210
The monkey crashes.

4007
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:11,380
The bear crashes on them.

4008
01:50:11,381 --> 01:50:11,651
It's like,

4009
01:50:11,651 --> 01:50:12,190
you know what?

4010
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:13,150
I think I'm just gonna eat you

4011
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:16,810
and just fucking malls that monkey.

4012
01:50:16,811 --> 01:50:21,190
And they're all grabbing him and pulling
the monkey away and look at this,

4013
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:23,830
that monkeys Foxville son,

4014
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:26,330
that bear is just going
off on that monkey.

4015
01:50:26,331 --> 01:50:26,621
It's like,

4016
01:50:26,621 --> 01:50:27,580
you stupid bitch.

4017
01:50:27,581 --> 01:50:29,140
You dropped your fucking bike.

4018
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:29,891
That's it.

4019
01:50:29,891 --> 01:50:32,620
I've been thinking about
eating you for months.

4020
01:50:35,290 --> 01:50:38,500
I bet his instincts where when
something goes down in front of you,

4021
01:50:38,501 --> 01:50:39,340
you just start eating it.

4022
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:39,750
Yeah.

4023
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:40,290
You know?

4024
01:50:40,290 --> 01:50:40,540
Yeah.

4025
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:42,530
I think that's like bare one-on-one,

4026
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:43,413
right?

4027
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:46,510
If you're a bear and some shit
trips in front of you like that,

4028
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:48,920
you just started eating like
you got a gift from the gods.

4029
01:50:48,921 --> 01:50:49,630
Yeah.

4030
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:50,740
How could you not do that?

4031
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:52,480
Why would you not?

4032
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:52,810
Yeah.

4033
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:54,130
You don't train bear stupid.

4034
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:55,450
You think you train bears.

4035
01:50:55,451 --> 01:50:56,440
He trained for a little bit.

4036
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:58,870
We got him to ride a bike and
while he's riding that bike,

4037
01:50:58,871 --> 01:50:59,141
he's going,

4038
01:50:59,141 --> 01:51:01,160
I want to eat that monkey God.

4039
01:51:01,420 --> 01:51:01,960
Damn.

4040
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:02,793
Eat that monkey.

4041
01:51:04,930 --> 01:51:06,460
Not many times you can use that sentence.

4042
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:06,821
Yeah.

4043
01:51:06,821 --> 01:51:07,810
Unless you Joey Diaz,

4044
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:09,220
you use it all day.

4045
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:11,830
We thought Monkey Cock sucker.

4046
01:51:12,780 --> 01:51:13,060
Um,

4047
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:15,970
so you had all these experiences.

4048
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:19,090
Did it make you look at
fighting any differently?

4049
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:20,160
Yeah,

4050
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:20,670
yeah.

4051
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:21,503
Um,

4052
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:27,300
this is going to sound kind of odd
because I carried on fighting after the

4053
01:51:27,301 --> 01:51:27,751
experience,

4054
01:51:27,751 --> 01:51:29,490
but I kind of saw the futility in it,

4055
01:51:29,491 --> 01:51:30,540
the pointlessness in it,

4056
01:51:31,050 --> 01:51:31,680
you know?

4057
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:31,980
Right.

4058
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:34,710
I mean there's a British comedy that,

4059
01:51:34,711 --> 01:51:35,190
uh,

4060
01:51:35,190 --> 01:51:36,540
that kind of captures it really well.

4061
01:51:36,541 --> 01:51:37,800
They do like a parody of a,

4062
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:38,191
like a,

4063
01:51:38,191 --> 01:51:40,230
a soccer commercial and the like,

4064
01:51:40,231 --> 01:51:40,471
you know,

4065
01:51:40,471 --> 01:51:42,560
talking about Manchester
United and Arsenal then,

4066
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:43,470
and they'll,

4067
01:51:43,470 --> 01:51:46,620
they'll win and they'll see who wins
now and then next year it will carry on

4068
01:51:46,621 --> 01:51:48,510
just the same and there'll
be more guys that win.

4069
01:51:48,511 --> 01:51:49,021
And you know what I mean?

4070
01:51:49,021 --> 01:51:49,711
It's the same thing.

4071
01:51:49,711 --> 01:51:51,510
Like I can be the champion for 10 years,

4072
01:51:51,511 --> 01:51:53,220
but once that 11th years comes,

4073
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:54,900
there's going to be
somebody else's champion.

4074
01:51:54,901 --> 01:51:56,580
And it will just continue on forever.

4075
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:57,330
And,

4076
01:51:57,330 --> 01:51:57,590
and it's,

4077
01:51:57,590 --> 01:51:57,820
it's,

4078
01:51:57,820 --> 01:51:58,653
it's the,

4079
01:51:58,850 --> 01:51:59,140
it's,

4080
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:00,900
it's the absolute core of,

4081
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:01,171
of,

4082
01:52:01,171 --> 01:52:05,430
of the capitalist approach to life is to
actually beat someone down to take food

4083
01:52:05,431 --> 01:52:06,270
out of their mouth,

4084
01:52:06,810 --> 01:52:08,040
which is really kind of odd.

4085
01:52:08,041 --> 01:52:09,570
And I've never seen it like that before.

4086
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:10,261
Normally it's like,

4087
01:52:10,261 --> 01:52:10,381
yeah,

4088
01:52:10,381 --> 01:52:10,860
I'm gonna,

4089
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:11,820
I'm gonna beat the hell out of that guy.

4090
01:52:11,821 --> 01:52:13,140
I'm going to take what he's got.

4091
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:14,610
But now I,

4092
01:52:14,610 --> 01:52:15,001
I,

4093
01:52:15,001 --> 01:52:15,834
I'm kind of,

4094
01:52:15,990 --> 01:52:16,620
I liked the,

4095
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:17,453
I liked the,

4096
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:19,170
I liked the competition.

4097
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:20,010
I liked the,

4098
01:52:20,010 --> 01:52:22,890
the actual physical test of fighting,

4099
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:24,840
but not for the same reasons.

4100
01:52:24,841 --> 01:52:25,140
Not,

4101
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:27,360
not to like to be more
successful than you know,

4102
01:52:27,361 --> 01:52:28,194
to

4103
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:29,323
can you can,

4104
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:31,550
can you continue with the same passion,

4105
01:52:31,730 --> 01:52:34,430
having different ideas of
what's important about finding?

4106
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:35,161
Yeah,

4107
01:52:35,161 --> 01:52:35,461
because,

4108
01:52:35,461 --> 01:52:36,294
well,

4109
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:37,600
the one thing that I,

4110
01:52:37,610 --> 01:52:39,780
that was really starting to focus on,

4111
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:40,280
uh,

4112
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:40,850
you know,

4113
01:52:40,850 --> 01:52:44,550
with the MEF fight since I went to Peru
with the Mfi and I go going into the

4114
01:52:44,551 --> 01:52:45,420
Brown fight as well.

4115
01:52:45,421 --> 01:52:45,800
And,

4116
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:46,100
and this

4117
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:47,120
is the reason why I would,

4118
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:48,400
I would at least like the option to,

4119
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:49,600
to carry on fighting.

4120
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:49,851
You know,

4121
01:52:49,851 --> 01:52:51,560
I would like to be able
to get cleared so I can,

4122
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:52,460
you know,

4123
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:53,680
I don't think I'll go back to flying,

4124
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:54,470
you know,

4125
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:58,640
three times a year and chasing the
belt because my focus is elsewhere now.

4126
01:52:59,000 --> 01:52:59,833
Where's your focus?

4127
01:53:00,650 --> 01:53:01,483
Well,

4128
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:03,200
there's a space that you get to.

4129
01:53:03,201 --> 01:53:04,370
When do you read much?

4130
01:53:04,371 --> 01:53:05,120
Carl Sagan?

4131
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:06,740
You read the dragons of Eden.

4132
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:09,200
How about the tree and brain and the,

4133
01:53:09,610 --> 01:53:10,080
um,

4134
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:10,730
I'm trying to,

4135
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:13,430
I'm trying to like understand
the distinction between
the different areas of the

4136
01:53:13,431 --> 01:53:13,641
brain.

4137
01:53:13,641 --> 01:53:14,421
The reptilian brain,

4138
01:53:14,421 --> 01:53:16,130
which is obviously
responsible for all the,

4139
01:53:16,131 --> 01:53:16,450
uh,

4140
01:53:16,450 --> 01:53:16,960
the,

4141
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:17,870
the aggressiveness,

4142
01:53:17,871 --> 01:53:18,081
the,

4143
01:53:18,081 --> 01:53:19,190
the instinctual stuff.

4144
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:20,050
Um,

4145
01:53:20,050 --> 01:53:20,280
uh,

4146
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:20,420
the,

4147
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:20,601
the,

4148
01:53:20,601 --> 01:53:23,180
the fights and the killing
and all that kind of,

4149
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:24,380
that's the reptilian brain.

4150
01:53:24,470 --> 01:53:26,240
The political side of it is basically,

4151
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:27,643
um,

4152
01:53:27,710 --> 01:53:28,401
and then after that,

4153
01:53:28,401 --> 01:53:29,720
then you've got like
the old mammalian brain,

4154
01:53:29,721 --> 01:53:33,440
which is where we start to make kind of
like basic connections with people and

4155
01:53:33,441 --> 01:53:34,850
understand that if we work as a group,

4156
01:53:34,851 --> 01:53:35,420
we can,

4157
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:35,660
you know,

4158
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:36,770
we can survive better.

4159
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:38,300
And then the next level up is,

4160
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:40,170
is obviously a higher consciousness is,

4161
01:53:40,171 --> 01:53:42,110
is having deeper understanding,

4162
01:53:42,111 --> 01:53:44,750
deeper relationships and
communications with people around you.

4163
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:47,300
But there's a point when you fight,

4164
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:50,150
where were the reptilian brain takes over.

4165
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:52,910
And I usually feel it after I've
been cracked a couple of times.

4166
01:53:52,911 --> 01:53:54,200
Like when I was fighting Ludwig in,

4167
01:53:54,210 --> 01:53:54,630
uh,

4168
01:53:54,630 --> 01:53:55,490
at the MGM,

4169
01:53:56,510 --> 01:54:00,410
I was very conscious for the first
30 or 30 seconds or so of the five.

4170
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,760
And then as I stepped in,

4171
01:54:01,761 --> 01:54:01,960
you,

4172
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:04,760
you remember he cracked me with that
right hand route and the Chin and I rushed

4173
01:54:04,761 --> 01:54:09,590
him up against the fence and immediately
I switched over to to instinct.

4174
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:10,483
And it's,

4175
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:11,720
it's like being a passenger.

4176
01:54:12,260 --> 01:54:13,100
It's like I'm not,

4177
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,110
I have no conscious,

4178
01:54:15,650 --> 01:54:16,400
uh,

4179
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:17,990
decision making ability in that,

4180
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:18,740
in that time.

4181
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:19,700
It's all instinct.

4182
01:54:19,701 --> 01:54:20,120
I'm not,

4183
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:21,560
I'm not focused at all on,

4184
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:23,090
on what he's doing.

4185
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:23,930
I'm just reading,

4186
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:25,430
I'm just feeling and,

4187
01:54:25,431 --> 01:54:25,650
and I,

4188
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:25,911
and I,

4189
01:54:25,911 --> 01:54:26,361
I want it.

4190
01:54:26,361 --> 01:54:27,680
I want to find if I can get,

4191
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:30,410
I want to see if I can get to that
place for a longer period of time.

4192
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:31,341
You know what I mean?

4193
01:54:31,341 --> 01:54:32,300
Like with the Amea fight,

4194
01:54:32,301 --> 01:54:33,920
I felt like I would slip in and out of it,

4195
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:36,110
like let the first round it was,

4196
01:54:36,111 --> 01:54:38,300
it was so overwhelming
because it was hometown,

4197
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:38,781
you know,

4198
01:54:38,781 --> 01:54:41,180
my name was being showered by you know,

4199
01:54:41,390 --> 01:54:42,870
8,000 people or something and,

4200
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:43,590
and,

4201
01:54:43,590 --> 01:54:44,330
and you know,

4202
01:54:44,330 --> 01:54:45,350
I live next to the arena.

4203
01:54:45,351 --> 01:54:46,940
So it occurred to me that if I lost,

4204
01:54:47,030 --> 01:54:50,060
that would be on my mind every
time I looked out my window.

4205
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:53,510
So the first round I lost it.

4206
01:54:53,511 --> 01:54:54,081
I mean I just,

4207
01:54:54,081 --> 01:54:57,440
I just kind of moved around and backed
up and when I sat down in my corner after

4208
01:54:57,441 --> 01:54:57,951
the first round,

4209
01:54:57,951 --> 01:54:59,060
I apologize to my team.

4210
01:54:59,060 --> 01:54:59,331
I said,

4211
01:54:59,331 --> 01:54:59,631
I'm sorry,

4212
01:54:59,631 --> 01:55:00,860
I just had to get that out of the way.

4213
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:02,630
But then the second and third round,

4214
01:55:02,631 --> 01:55:03,930
I felt like I could reach that,

4215
01:55:04,090 --> 01:55:07,580
that stage sometime where I just kind
of allow my body to take over and just

4216
01:55:07,581 --> 01:55:09,590
switch off and in the
face we would just watch.

4217
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:11,180
Do you think that's
what Anderson is doing?

4218
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:12,080
I think is that,

4219
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:13,190
that's exactly what he's doing.

4220
01:55:13,191 --> 01:55:13,850
Yeah.

4221
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:14,780
But I don't know as he's,

4222
01:55:14,781 --> 01:55:16,730
as he's aware of himself doing it.

4223
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:18,610
Do you know what I mean?

4224
01:55:18,610 --> 01:55:19,251
It's so good.

4225
01:55:19,251 --> 01:55:19,521
It does.

4226
01:55:19,521 --> 01:55:20,330
How he locked it in.

4227
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:20,780
Yeah.

4228
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:21,291
I just think,

4229
01:55:21,291 --> 01:55:22,510
I just think when the fight starts,

4230
01:55:22,511 --> 01:55:23,510
he immediately switches over.

4231
01:55:23,511 --> 01:55:23,781
But you,

4232
01:55:23,781 --> 01:55:25,130
you can see it in people's eyes.

4233
01:55:25,131 --> 01:55:26,630
Like vandelays a great example.

4234
01:55:26,810 --> 01:55:29,420
If you watch one vandelays highlight
reels where he's got a few of his stare

4235
01:55:29,421 --> 01:55:29,721
downs,

4236
01:55:29,721 --> 01:55:32,380
he immediately switches to reptile
mode as soon as he's fighting.

4237
01:55:32,390 --> 01:55:33,950
That's a great way of
putting it with him too.

4238
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:34,821
It's true.

4239
01:55:34,821 --> 01:55:35,250
But you know,

4240
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:37,190
and like man Hoff is another one.

4241
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:38,530
Those guys that have just,

4242
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:40,490
they've just got that
light instinctual rage.

4243
01:55:40,620 --> 01:55:41,780
It just kind of comes on.

4244
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:43,150
But,

4245
01:55:43,150 --> 01:55:44,220
and this is why like,

4246
01:55:44,221 --> 01:55:44,431
you know,

4247
01:55:44,431 --> 01:55:44,591
I've,

4248
01:55:44,591 --> 01:55:46,200
I've always kind of heard the term,

4249
01:55:46,201 --> 01:55:46,430
you know,

4250
01:55:46,430 --> 01:55:47,263
you,

4251
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:51,160
you mean 20 even 10 20% of the things
that you learned in the gym and natural

4252
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:51,580
fight,

4253
01:55:51,580 --> 01:55:51,790
you know,

4254
01:55:51,790 --> 01:55:52,611
when adrenaline and,

4255
01:55:52,611 --> 01:55:52,821
and,

4256
01:55:52,821 --> 01:55:54,030
and the actual fight is,

4257
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:55,380
is occurring,

4258
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:56,900
you only kind of maintain,

4259
01:55:56,970 --> 01:55:59,370
like keep about 20% of what
you've learned in the gym.

4260
01:55:59,371 --> 01:56:01,560
So the idea has been in the gym,

4261
01:56:01,561 --> 01:56:06,090
you train yourself to the point where it
does become instinct and then when the

4262
01:56:06,091 --> 01:56:09,840
fight happens you just switched to reptile
mode and reptile mode uses the skills

4263
01:56:09,841 --> 01:56:12,510
that you learn to to get the
job done more efficiently.

4264
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:18,180
Do you think that becoming more
aware or reaching a higher state of

4265
01:56:18,181 --> 01:56:21,690
consciousness because of your experiences
will actually help you because it will

4266
01:56:21,691 --> 01:56:26,190
abandon a lot of the distractions that
you present yourself almost unknowingly?

4267
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:26,701
Yeah,

4268
01:56:26,701 --> 01:56:28,140
well it helps me,

4269
01:56:28,141 --> 01:56:31,770
it helps me in training and particularly
in when I'm running now because I used

4270
01:56:31,771 --> 01:56:34,640
to listen to like Pantera and yeah,

4271
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:35,700
like vision of disorder.

4272
01:56:35,710 --> 01:56:39,510
When I was running I'd worked myself
into like a rage so I wouldn't run to

4273
01:56:39,511 --> 01:56:40,171
exhaustion.

4274
01:56:40,171 --> 01:56:42,810
That was kind of how I trained and I
trained all the way through my career like

4275
01:56:42,811 --> 01:56:43,380
that.

4276
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:44,880
And the last couple of
fights I've switched it up.

4277
01:56:44,881 --> 01:56:47,820
I be listening to a lot more like bite
and more like blind binaural beat type of

4278
01:56:47,821 --> 01:56:51,950
stuff when I'm running so I could get
into more like a meditative stage,

4279
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:52,823
you know,

4280
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:55,890
doing a lot of yoga as well and trying
to find the same thing where you just

4281
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:59,340
[inaudible] you're within yourself and
you're not focusing on anything else.

4282
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:01,380
So your body's almost like on autopilot.

4283
01:57:02,430 --> 01:57:03,160
Yeah.

4284
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:04,720
That you,

4285
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:08,850
the music that you listened to when you
train can have a profound effect on how

4286
01:57:08,851 --> 01:57:09,930
you approach your training.

4287
01:57:09,950 --> 01:57:10,380
Yeah,

4288
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:11,213
it really can.

4289
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:12,061
It's so important.

4290
01:57:12,061 --> 01:57:14,970
And that's why I've always been so
vocal about all the stuff I listened to.

4291
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:15,741
Like I'd,

4292
01:57:15,741 --> 01:57:16,890
I'd like training camp playlist,

4293
01:57:16,891 --> 01:57:20,160
so I tweet everyday trunk songs I was
listening to and that kind of thing.

4294
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:21,660
It is important.

4295
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:21,871
And,

4296
01:57:21,871 --> 01:57:22,071
and,

4297
01:57:22,071 --> 01:57:22,471
and the,

4298
01:57:22,471 --> 01:57:23,131
the other thing as well,

4299
01:57:23,131 --> 01:57:24,180
like earlier on in my career,

4300
01:57:24,181 --> 01:57:26,160
I would use music to anchor feelings.

4301
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:27,390
So like,

4302
01:57:27,390 --> 01:57:27,700
like,

4303
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:28,020
uh,

4304
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:28,741
when I fought Ludwick,

4305
01:57:28,741 --> 01:57:30,540
I used a song called ion by Woodkid,

4306
01:57:31,170 --> 01:57:34,020
which was the first time I'd switched it
up from England belongs to me for like,

4307
01:57:34,050 --> 01:57:34,550
you know,

4308
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:35,490
a bunch of fires.

4309
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:37,093
Um,

4310
01:57:37,470 --> 01:57:39,390
so like for the 12 weeks of that fight,

4311
01:57:39,391 --> 01:57:40,500
I was training with Frank Mir.

4312
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:41,333
We were going up to read,

4313
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:44,670
it's up to Mount Charleston and now into
red rock and like doing hill running

4314
01:57:44,671 --> 01:57:45,151
and stuff.

4315
01:57:45,151 --> 01:57:46,800
And we had some real tough sessions.

4316
01:57:46,801 --> 01:57:47,160
I mean,

4317
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:47,530
you know,

4318
01:57:47,530 --> 01:57:49,470
we really put ourselves through
it for that training camp.

4319
01:57:50,010 --> 01:57:52,040
And as soon as I got back in
my truck after the second,

4320
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:52,711
after the session,

4321
01:57:52,711 --> 01:57:54,360
if I felt like it was a good session,

4322
01:57:54,361 --> 01:57:56,040
it was productive and I felt positive,

4323
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:57,330
I would put that song on.

4324
01:57:57,780 --> 01:58:00,610
And I would say I would constantly
connect those feelings to that,

4325
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:01,473
that song.

4326
01:58:01,890 --> 01:58:02,550
So then when,

4327
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:04,140
when I'm walking out
and that song comes on,

4328
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:05,940
immediately I get that feeling again.

4329
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:07,891
And it's just like,

4330
01:58:07,891 --> 01:58:08,131
you know,

4331
01:58:08,131 --> 01:58:09,220
just like when you listen to a song,

4332
01:58:09,221 --> 01:58:10,860
when you think of a person like,

4333
01:58:10,890 --> 01:58:11,041
oh,

4334
01:58:11,041 --> 01:58:13,320
I heard that song person and you meet,

4335
01:58:13,321 --> 01:58:14,520
you make that connection immediately.

4336
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,440
But you can also train yourself to do it.

4337
01:58:17,210 --> 01:58:19,620
So that's why you like
Alison to Cypress Hill now.

4338
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:22,290
And it'll take me back to
fighting in cage warriors.

4339
01:58:22,350 --> 01:58:22,770
Like,

4340
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:23,041
you know,

4341
01:58:23,041 --> 01:58:25,200
back in 2006 wow.

4342
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:28,830
And I have songs all the way through
like that and now I don't listen to,

4343
01:58:28,831 --> 01:58:30,660
cause it was like my first two fights.

4344
01:58:30,661 --> 01:58:31,740
I came out to Pantera,

4345
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:33,210
dragged the waters.

4346
01:58:33,450 --> 01:58:38,450
By the time I got to the cage I was so
wound up and so angry that I would just

4347
01:58:39,151 --> 01:58:40,590
add to run out of gas immediately.

4348
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:44,230
And now whenever I listen to those songs,

4349
01:58:44,231 --> 01:58:45,910
I get that feeling of like exhaustion.

4350
01:58:45,911 --> 01:58:46,130
Like,

4351
01:58:46,130 --> 01:58:46,963
oh,

4352
01:58:47,850 --> 01:58:48,780
that's hilarious.

4353
01:58:48,781 --> 01:58:49,520
Yeah.

4354
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:50,040
Yeah,

4355
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:50,281
yeah.

4356
01:58:50,281 --> 01:58:51,720
People have like sex songs.

4357
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:52,110
Yeah.

4358
01:58:52,110 --> 01:58:52,570
Remind them,

4359
01:58:52,570 --> 01:58:55,690
sex songs that remind you
of disappointment songs.

4360
01:58:55,691 --> 01:58:56,521
Remind me of extra.

4361
01:58:56,521 --> 01:58:58,230
Why did you connect sex to disappointment?

4362
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:00,540
Just standard,

4363
01:59:00,541 --> 01:59:01,360
isn't it?

4364
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:02,130
How it goes.

4365
01:59:02,130 --> 01:59:03,590
Most of the time we're just sex songs,

4366
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:05,600
like something crazy on the spin doctor.

4367
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:07,800
Um,

4368
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:08,820
so what's,

4369
01:59:08,821 --> 01:59:09,061
uh,

4370
01:59:09,061 --> 01:59:10,350
what's next from here?

4371
01:59:10,410 --> 01:59:11,000
If you,

4372
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:16,000
your focus has moved slightly off of
fighting and you still are interested in

4373
01:59:16,171 --> 01:59:18,870
fighting and you're still interested
in seeing what sort of state you can

4374
01:59:18,871 --> 01:59:20,990
achieve inside the octagon.

4375
01:59:21,170 --> 01:59:22,400
What else are you going
to do with your time?

4376
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:22,970
Well,

4377
01:59:22,970 --> 01:59:23,430
I'm,

4378
01:59:23,430 --> 01:59:24,740
I've been having a lot of ideas.

4379
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:25,430
Um,

4380
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:26,090
a lot of,

4381
01:59:26,090 --> 01:59:26,840
uh,

4382
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:29,410
I've had a few ceremonies recently
with various things and I've,

4383
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:30,273
I've,

4384
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:33,320
I've got quite a clear
direction of where I want to go.

4385
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:33,770
Um,

4386
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:34,191
I would like,

4387
01:59:34,191 --> 01:59:35,230
I want to get cleared to fight.

4388
01:59:35,231 --> 01:59:36,530
I would like to be able to fight again.

4389
01:59:36,610 --> 01:59:36,980
Um,

4390
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:37,671
even if it's just,

4391
01:59:37,671 --> 01:59:37,851
you know,

4392
01:59:37,851 --> 01:59:38,541
once a year,

4393
01:59:38,541 --> 01:59:40,850
once every 18 months
or something just and,

4394
01:59:40,851 --> 01:59:43,400
and just have a fight with like someone
that's going to be a fun fight where I

4395
01:59:43,401 --> 01:59:45,890
can kind of test some of these theories
and see where I'm at physically.

4396
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:47,053
Um,

4397
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:48,381
but I'm going to start,

4398
01:59:48,381 --> 01:59:52,460
I'm going to start a video blog
in my training sessions because,

4399
01:59:52,530 --> 01:59:53,363
uh,

4400
01:59:53,540 --> 01:59:54,530
I do all kinds of stuff.

4401
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:55,160
I do a lot of,

4402
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:56,330
a lot of big from Yoga,

4403
01:59:56,331 --> 01:59:59,960
a lot of hot yoga trail
running kettlebells sessions.

4404
02:00:00,050 --> 02:00:00,800
Uh,

4405
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:04,220
and then then I want to be able to go
into the gym and work on specific things.

4406
02:00:04,221 --> 02:00:04,471
Like,

4407
02:00:04,471 --> 02:00:09,290
like last night I went in to a 10th planet
Van Nuys and just kind of had a roll

4408
02:00:09,291 --> 02:00:10,220
around with those guys.

4409
02:00:10,221 --> 02:00:12,100
And I enjoyed it because cause there was,

4410
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:12,651
it was very,

4411
02:00:12,651 --> 02:00:13,251
very playful.

4412
02:00:13,251 --> 02:00:14,960
There was no like agenda.

4413
02:00:14,961 --> 02:00:16,490
I had no agenda because I was just,

4414
02:00:16,491 --> 02:00:17,360
I was in the moment.

4415
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:18,920
You're just learning and exactly.

4416
02:00:19,070 --> 02:00:19,371
And then,

4417
02:00:19,371 --> 02:00:20,690
and obviously when you've
got to training camp,

4418
02:00:20,691 --> 02:00:22,370
everything's always like,

4419
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:22,511
ah,

4420
02:00:22,511 --> 02:00:26,390
I've always felt like I was wishing my
life away because I'm constantly waiting

4421
02:00:26,391 --> 02:00:27,380
for a date that was five,

4422
02:00:27,381 --> 02:00:28,490
six weeks ahead.

4423
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:30,080
So I'm never in the moment.

4424
02:00:30,081 --> 02:00:31,310
I'm always in the moment,

4425
02:00:31,370 --> 02:00:31,760
you know,

4426
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:32,593
that's,

4427
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:33,500
that's to come.

4428
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:35,810
George was talking about
how much he enjoys,

4429
02:00:35,830 --> 02:00:36,050
uh,

4430
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:38,900
training in between fights
because then they just like,

4431
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:42,350
he just will go box for like
six weeks or eight weeks,

4432
02:00:42,470 --> 02:00:44,330
just only boxing concentrate only on that.

4433
02:00:44,331 --> 02:00:47,090
And then we'll do Jujitsu in New
York who go there with Donna,

4434
02:00:47,091 --> 02:00:49,520
her train with him for six weeks.

4435
02:00:51,110 --> 02:00:51,943
I just want to do that.

4436
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,300
I want to take a trip out to,

4437
02:00:53,770 --> 02:00:54,290
um,

4438
02:00:54,290 --> 02:00:57,000
at Southeast Asia and do
a little tour of Thailand.

4439
02:00:57,310 --> 02:00:58,520
Are you going to become a shaman,

4440
02:00:58,670 --> 02:00:59,300
Dan Hardy?

4441
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:00,133
I don't know.

4442
02:01:00,170 --> 02:01:01,700
I feel like you are on that path.

4443
02:01:01,710 --> 02:01:03,080
I'm not having it in an
interesting direction,

4444
02:01:03,081 --> 02:01:03,950
but I want to,

4445
02:01:03,951 --> 02:01:04,880
I want to start kind of,

4446
02:01:05,210 --> 02:01:06,040
kind of,

4447
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:06,680
uh,

4448
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:07,161
promoting,

4449
02:01:07,161 --> 02:01:07,320
uh,

4450
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:09,560
and more of an alternative lifestyle,

4451
02:01:09,590 --> 02:01:10,423
but what I'm doing,

4452
02:01:10,470 --> 02:01:12,380
what was my diet and my,

4453
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:12,830
you know,

4454
02:01:12,830 --> 02:01:13,551
teacher plants,

4455
02:01:13,551 --> 02:01:15,180
medicines and uh,

4456
02:01:15,190 --> 02:01:15,441
and,

4457
02:01:15,441 --> 02:01:17,270
and my approach to training and health,

4458
02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:17,800
you know,

4459
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:18,220
I have,

4460
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:19,053
I'm really,

4461
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:21,680
really focused on getting
strong and flexible right now.

4462
02:01:21,950 --> 02:01:23,780
That's my main focus through,

4463
02:01:23,781 --> 02:01:24,021
you know,

4464
02:01:24,021 --> 02:01:26,590
kettlebells and bodyweight exercises and,

4465
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:27,800
and lots of stretching.

4466
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:29,100
Um,

4467
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:29,280
and,

4468
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:31,490
and I'm just kind of interested to
see where this journey is going to go.

4469
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:32,580
My,

4470
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:32,920
my,

4471
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:33,471
my goal is,

4472
02:01:33,471 --> 02:01:35,660
is to basically get paid to be myself.

4473
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:37,340
That's what I want to do.

4474
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:38,001
And do.

4475
02:01:38,001 --> 02:01:38,720
Improve yourself.

4476
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:39,553
Yes,

4477
02:01:39,860 --> 02:01:40,520
exactly.

4478
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:40,800
So,

4479
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:41,271
and,

4480
02:01:41,271 --> 02:01:41,721
and you know,

4481
02:01:41,721 --> 02:01:42,554
kind of,

4482
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:43,490
you know,

4483
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:44,170
I have,

4484
02:01:44,170 --> 02:01:45,920
I have sponsors right
now that a supportive,

4485
02:01:45,921 --> 02:01:47,350
obviously know what would zines and Fay,

4486
02:01:47,351 --> 02:01:49,740
the flights and venom and you know,

4487
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:51,140
that I want them to,

4488
02:01:51,141 --> 02:01:55,190
to continue to support me and while I'm
on this question and doing all this kind

4489
02:01:55,191 --> 02:01:56,540
of interesting stuff.

4490
02:01:56,541 --> 02:01:59,450
So I figured if I put a video blog
out there for people to watch this,

4491
02:01:59,480 --> 02:01:59,721
you know,

4492
02:01:59,721 --> 02:02:00,410
it gives them a,

4493
02:02:00,410 --> 02:02:01,071
that's a great idea.

4494
02:02:01,071 --> 02:02:02,420
I've been more of a connection Wolf camp.

4495
02:02:02,450 --> 02:02:03,283
I think I can recall it.

4496
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:04,670
The Wolfcamp fuck.

4497
02:02:04,670 --> 02:02:05,420
Yeah.

4498
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:06,253
Um,

4499
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:07,133
yeah.

4500
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:07,850
Oh,

4501
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:08,740
they're so worried.

4502
02:02:09,850 --> 02:02:10,260
So,

4503
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:10,701
so I think,

4504
02:02:10,701 --> 02:02:11,660
I think that's what I'm going to do.

4505
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:12,260
Um,

4506
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:13,880
I have some other ideas as well.

4507
02:02:13,970 --> 02:02:14,780
Um,

4508
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:15,081
I have,

4509
02:02:15,081 --> 02:02:15,860
uh,

4510
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:17,420
I have a few people to
speak to her about some,

4511
02:02:17,421 --> 02:02:18,560
some business ideas that are,

4512
02:02:18,561 --> 02:02:19,820
have again,

4513
02:02:19,821 --> 02:02:20,654
all within the same,

4514
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:21,320
if it's illegal,

4515
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:22,620
don't it on this podcast,

4516
02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:24,070
it's most definitely not illegal.

4517
02:02:24,390 --> 02:02:25,223
Um,

4518
02:02:25,580 --> 02:02:26,540
at least not in Peru.

4519
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:28,150
No,

4520
02:02:28,150 --> 02:02:28,590
no.

4521
02:02:28,590 --> 02:02:28,880
Uh,

4522
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:29,270
like,

4523
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:30,103
you know,

4524
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:33,920
try and help promote a more
clean and conscious lifestyle.

4525
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:35,840
So what is your diet now?

4526
02:02:36,530 --> 02:02:37,730
I'm predominantly Vegan now.

4527
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:39,353
Bitch,

4528
02:02:39,890 --> 02:02:40,790
I thought we'd get into this.

4529
02:02:40,791 --> 02:02:42,290
I heard this call went dark.

4530
02:02:42,291 --> 02:02:43,124
I mean,

4531
02:02:43,530 --> 02:02:43,980
I,

4532
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:44,813
I'm not,

4533
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:45,611
I'm not,

4534
02:02:45,611 --> 02:02:46,010
uh,

4535
02:02:46,010 --> 02:02:47,450
I'm not giving it a name because he's not,

4536
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:48,350
not really got a name.

4537
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:49,213
I'm just kind of,

4538
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:51,260
my approach to animal products are,

4539
02:02:51,261 --> 02:02:52,070
I will,

4540
02:02:52,070 --> 02:02:54,590
I will have animal
products occasionally if,

4541
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:57,650
if I know that it's from a source
that I'm uncomfortable with,

4542
02:02:58,220 --> 02:02:59,053
you know,

4543
02:02:59,300 --> 02:03:00,770
like hunted meat or free range.

4544
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:01,191
Exactly.

4545
02:03:01,191 --> 02:03:01,761
Or something like that.

4546
02:03:01,761 --> 02:03:02,440
Exactly.

4547
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:02,990
Yeah.

4548
02:03:02,990 --> 02:03:03,790
Um,

4549
02:03:03,790 --> 02:03:07,220
I will eat fish all day long because
fish don't even take care of the babies.

4550
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:08,900
That's that.

4551
02:03:08,900 --> 02:03:10,450
That's my larger fish.

4552
02:03:10,860 --> 02:03:11,930
But anybody who doesn't eat fish,

4553
02:03:11,931 --> 02:03:12,410
it's crazy.

4554
02:03:12,410 --> 02:03:13,910
But what about from a
selfish point of view?

4555
02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:16,010
If you don't know where the fish is from?

4556
02:03:16,011 --> 02:03:19,550
Like if you went out to a restaurant
and it was just farm raise is not good.

4557
02:03:19,670 --> 02:03:21,890
A lot of farm raised stuff is not good.

4558
02:03:21,970 --> 02:03:22,730
Um,

4559
02:03:22,730 --> 02:03:24,560
because first of all,

4560
02:03:24,710 --> 02:03:27,920
a lot of times they're exposed to higher
levels of mercury and apparently there

4561
02:03:27,921 --> 02:03:29,870
were higher levels of toxins.

4562
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:31,280
Cause if you're in like,

4563
02:03:31,281 --> 02:03:31,610
Geez,

4564
02:03:31,610 --> 02:03:34,980
tanks of water or farms of all fish,

4565
02:03:34,981 --> 02:03:36,710
she's shitting on each
other and it's just,

4566
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:38,870
it's another healthy and tastes good.

4567
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:39,980
It demeaning.

4568
02:03:39,980 --> 02:03:40,161
I mean,

4569
02:03:40,161 --> 02:03:41,540
it's better than not eat in it.

4570
02:03:41,930 --> 02:03:42,141
I mean,

4571
02:03:42,141 --> 02:03:42,980
it's not that bad,

4572
02:03:42,981 --> 02:03:45,200
but I think that it's been proven that,

4573
02:03:45,230 --> 02:03:45,620
uh,

4574
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:47,540
that like when you see like red,

4575
02:03:47,541 --> 02:03:51,080
deep red salmon and then you see
like the salmon that you get,

4576
02:03:51,081 --> 02:03:53,690
like this farm raised salmon
where they have to dye it pink.

4577
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:56,500
It's been proven that that's
wild stuff tastes better.

4578
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:58,320
There's something better about it.

4579
02:03:58,530 --> 02:03:59,480
It's probably better for you.

4580
02:03:59,510 --> 02:04:00,440
I don't know if it's better for you,

4581
02:04:00,441 --> 02:04:01,400
but it's probably better for it.

4582
02:04:01,401 --> 02:04:02,234
Yeah.

4583
02:04:02,430 --> 02:04:02,870
You know,

4584
02:04:02,870 --> 02:04:06,380
I tweeted something to the
day I was in a store in Boise,

4585
02:04:06,381 --> 02:04:07,960
Idaho and uh,

4586
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:08,301
it was,

4587
02:04:08,301 --> 02:04:08,990
uh,

4588
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:13,990
it was a photograph of the ingredients
of a bottle of soda and one of the

4589
02:04:14,631 --> 02:04:17,090
Ingredients with artificial wild cherries.

4590
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:23,060
That's hilarious.

4591
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:24,080
So come to America,

4592
02:04:24,110 --> 02:04:25,670
Monsanto probably owns the patent on it.

4593
02:04:27,390 --> 02:04:28,480
So we were talking about this and,

4594
02:04:28,481 --> 02:04:29,200
and I got into it,

4595
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:30,200
my theory of a,

4596
02:04:30,210 --> 02:04:31,850
of of stoner language,

4597
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:33,740
the style like stoner
understandings of the world,

4598
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:36,320
things that you see if you smoke weed,

4599
02:04:36,321 --> 02:04:37,840
the other people that weed don't.

4600
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:39,570
And that's that kind of thing.

4601
02:04:40,170 --> 02:04:41,400
Artificial Wild Cherries.

4602
02:04:41,430 --> 02:04:42,263
Wow,

4603
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:43,253
that's sweet.

4604
02:04:43,570 --> 02:04:44,403
Yeah,

4605
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:45,740
it's hilarious.

4606
02:04:45,740 --> 02:04:46,740
And it's really funny,

4607
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:47,460
like people,

4608
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:48,293
people that don't

4609
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:51,690
use plants in various ways,

4610
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:52,350
um,

4611
02:04:52,350 --> 02:04:53,520
don't see these things.

4612
02:04:53,521 --> 02:04:53,880
They don't,

4613
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:56,430
they don't pick up on these
artificial wild cherries.

4614
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,220
I,

4615
02:04:57,220 --> 02:04:57,781
you know,

4616
02:04:57,781 --> 02:04:58,201
I'm not a,

4617
02:04:58,201 --> 02:05:03,090
I'm not 100% proponent of all people
using marijuana because I know some people

4618
02:05:03,091 --> 02:05:03,690
can't.

4619
02:05:03,690 --> 02:05:03,901
Well,

4620
02:05:03,901 --> 02:05:04,260
yeah,

4621
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:05,093
I know they can't,

4622
02:05:05,330 --> 02:05:05,761
but you know,

4623
02:05:05,761 --> 02:05:07,260
when you hear somebody
say something like that,

4624
02:05:07,261 --> 02:05:07,531
you're like,

4625
02:05:07,531 --> 02:05:07,661
yeah,

4626
02:05:07,661 --> 02:05:08,510
that was a stoner.

4627
02:05:09,030 --> 02:05:09,863
Yeah.

4628
02:05:09,950 --> 02:05:12,990
There's certain things that people say
where you automatically know this guy

4629
02:05:12,991 --> 02:05:13,570
gets high.

4630
02:05:13,570 --> 02:05:14,390
I,

4631
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:15,160
I'm like,

4632
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:17,460
they get high and they don't
get high like Stan Hope.

4633
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:18,241
Thanks Dan.

4634
02:05:18,241 --> 02:05:20,040
Hope totally seems like
you would get high,

4635
02:05:20,041 --> 02:05:20,880
but he doesn't get hot.

4636
02:05:21,210 --> 02:05:22,080
He doesn't like it.

4637
02:05:22,290 --> 02:05:22,590
It says,

4638
02:05:22,590 --> 02:05:23,600
it makes him feel paranoid.

4639
02:05:23,650 --> 02:05:24,690
He doesn't like it at all.

4640
02:05:24,830 --> 02:05:27,360
It's maybe some people that just
naturally inclined to be like that.

4641
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:29,130
I couldn't tell.

4642
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:29,641
You know,

4643
02:05:29,641 --> 02:05:34,641
I feel like it's obvious when you look
at terrible people that someone's brain

4644
02:05:35,401 --> 02:05:37,170
works different than
your brain or my brain.

4645
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:37,520
Yeah.

4646
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:40,530
And when you see like a guy like Gandhi,

4647
02:05:40,630 --> 02:05:41,431
for sure,

4648
02:05:41,431 --> 02:05:43,350
his brain works different than my brain.

4649
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:44,880
There's just no doubt about it.

4650
02:05:44,910 --> 02:05:48,450
He also had his own path and he also
had his own intentions and his own life.

4651
02:05:48,810 --> 02:05:53,160
But I just can't imagine that his
interpretation of life was the same as my

4652
02:05:53,161 --> 02:05:54,210
interpretation of life.

4653
02:05:54,570 --> 02:05:55,620
And if that's the case,

4654
02:05:55,890 --> 02:05:58,380
how the fuck do I know
what pot does to you?

4655
02:05:58,710 --> 02:05:59,790
How the fuck would I know?

4656
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:00,630
I,

4657
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:01,463
you know,

4658
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:03,120
I know people can't smoke it.

4659
02:06:03,121 --> 02:06:06,600
They smoke it and then they'll wake up
three days later with their pants off in

4660
02:06:06,601 --> 02:06:07,434
the jungle.

4661
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:07,830
You know,

4662
02:06:07,830 --> 02:06:08,100
like,

4663
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:08,810
I don't know,

4664
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:09,643
like a good weekend

4665
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:13,410
unless one of those wandering spiders.

4666
02:06:13,830 --> 02:06:14,420
Gotcha.

4667
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:15,780
It gives you a hard on until you die.

4668
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:16,591
I spent two weeks,

4669
02:06:16,591 --> 02:06:17,850
we'll come around the
juggling my underwear.

4670
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:18,713
How dare you sir.

4671
02:06:19,150 --> 02:06:19,983
You get nervous.

4672
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:20,640
No,

4673
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:21,130
nothing bite.

4674
02:06:21,130 --> 02:06:21,931
And you know nothing.

4675
02:06:21,931 --> 02:06:24,540
You feel like you had the secret on your
sides and you're putting out positive

4676
02:06:24,550 --> 02:06:25,170
vibes.

4677
02:06:25,170 --> 02:06:26,250
I was very connected to it.

4678
02:06:26,790 --> 02:06:29,550
Like I wasn't going to mess
with everything and they
weren't gonna mess with me.

4679
02:06:29,551 --> 02:06:29,940
It was,

4680
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:30,480
yeah.

4681
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:33,030
Did you see Jaguars and
you're ill could hit?

4682
02:06:33,031 --> 02:06:33,480
No.

4683
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:34,320
We could hear him though.

4684
02:06:34,321 --> 02:06:34,620
Yeah.

4685
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:37,320
Because the jungle was literally
like outside of this dude,

4686
02:06:37,321 --> 02:06:37,920
wait a minute.

4687
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:39,090
So you're on Ios.

4688
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:40,740
Can you hear Jaguars?

4689
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:42,833
Yeah,

4690
02:06:44,020 --> 02:06:45,500
you could just have them find me.

4691
02:06:46,590 --> 02:06:49,200
Just come into contact
with each other and so on.

4692
02:06:49,230 --> 02:06:50,790
Does that make you shit your pants?

4693
02:06:51,900 --> 02:06:53,460
Not as much as the plane going over.

4694
02:06:53,461 --> 02:06:54,420
That was really scary.

4695
02:06:54,450 --> 02:06:54,601
Oh,

4696
02:06:54,601 --> 02:06:55,520
the little propeller boy.

4697
02:06:56,580 --> 02:06:58,860
We run a flight paths for Ketosis,

4698
02:06:58,890 --> 02:07:02,310
which is like the nearest airport
and like at eight 30 every night,

4699
02:07:02,311 --> 02:07:04,980
so like 30 minutes into the
ceremony like we were in,

4700
02:07:05,010 --> 02:07:05,431
we were in,

4701
02:07:05,431 --> 02:07:06,241
it's called them a locker,

4702
02:07:06,241 --> 02:07:07,290
the ceremonial building.

4703
02:07:07,291 --> 02:07:10,650
It was like a big circular wooden
building and it's caught Netapp to like,

4704
02:07:10,770 --> 02:07:13,050
like you know about me to hire uh,

4705
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:13,500
sorry,

4706
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:13,741
uh,

4707
02:07:13,741 --> 02:07:14,220
net,

4708
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:14,311
uh,

4709
02:07:14,311 --> 02:07:15,510
me to high off the floor.

4710
02:07:15,511 --> 02:07:17,280
So your light in the jungle pretty much.

4711
02:07:17,281 --> 02:07:21,360
There's not much separating
you and there's all kinds
of noises and crazy stuff

4712
02:07:21,361 --> 02:07:24,630
going on and it just kind of
becomes comfortable after a while.

4713
02:07:24,660 --> 02:07:25,770
But bugs are really loud,

4714
02:07:25,771 --> 02:07:26,070
right?

4715
02:07:26,070 --> 02:07:26,311
Yeah,

4716
02:07:26,311 --> 02:07:26,671
they are.

4717
02:07:26,671 --> 02:07:27,750
And the frogs as well.

4718
02:07:28,170 --> 02:07:32,040
But the plane was such an such an alien
kind of sound because we only heard it a

4719
02:07:32,041 --> 02:07:34,080
couple of times a day and the,

4720
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:34,381
you know,

4721
02:07:34,381 --> 02:07:36,040
the last time heard it was eight 30 at

4722
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:37,570
night just after without the other,

4723
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:38,021
you know,

4724
02:07:38,021 --> 02:07:41,170
the dose of Iowaska and it started to
come on and the next thing I can hear it

4725
02:07:42,510 --> 02:07:44,110
over my head and um,

4726
02:07:44,170 --> 02:07:46,780
and I can feel everybody else's
consciousness on that plane.

4727
02:07:46,781 --> 02:07:47,110
I'm like,

4728
02:07:47,110 --> 02:07:47,921
I know there are like,

4729
02:07:47,921 --> 02:07:48,490
you know,

4730
02:07:48,490 --> 02:07:52,720
like 250 people up there and I'm like
feeling all of that kind of energy go

4731
02:07:52,721 --> 02:07:52,871
over.

4732
02:07:52,871 --> 02:07:55,360
It was really weird and
it happened every night.

4733
02:07:55,361 --> 02:07:56,090
Every ceremony

4734
02:07:56,090 --> 02:07:58,220
in those third world plane flights,

4735
02:07:58,600 --> 02:07:59,630
Dems a little different.

4736
02:07:59,631 --> 02:08:00,980
So yeah,

4737
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:05,120
that was the chicken's in the
back down with fucking duct tape.

4738
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:07,680
You saw that plane crash that
happened and I picked that,

4739
02:08:07,681 --> 02:08:08,514
freaked me.

4740
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:10,270
Did you see that from Afghanistan?

4741
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:13,480
It was a cargo plane and they
think that the cargo shifted,

4742
02:08:13,481 --> 02:08:14,530
the load shifted,

4743
02:08:14,710 --> 02:08:16,270
like it wasn't tied down properly.

4744
02:08:17,170 --> 02:08:18,100
And when that happens,

4745
02:08:18,101 --> 02:08:20,470
if the load shifts the
plane just immediately,

4746
02:08:20,471 --> 02:08:23,220
all the weight goes to the front or the
back of the plane and they just nose

4747
02:08:23,221 --> 02:08:23,591
dive.

4748
02:08:23,591 --> 02:08:24,424
Wow.

4749
02:08:24,430 --> 02:08:25,120
Ooh.

4750
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:25,630
Yeah.

4751
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:26,530
It's pretty fucked up.

4752
02:08:26,531 --> 02:08:28,270
We'll end on that for a nice,

4753
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:29,201
beautiful,

4754
02:08:29,201 --> 02:08:32,140
cheery way to end just to,

4755
02:08:32,170 --> 02:08:34,840
just to let everybody know that you could,

4756
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:38,290
you could defy gravity for short
periods of time every now and again.

4757
02:08:39,130 --> 02:08:44,130
But if you fuck up then or it fucks
up or this mechanical failure or Jesus

4758
02:08:48,010 --> 02:08:48,011
Christ.

4759
02:08:48,011 --> 02:08:48,940
Imagine watching that.

4760
02:08:52,860 --> 02:08:53,693
Wow.

4761
02:08:54,110 --> 02:08:55,180
I just being on that bus,

4762
02:08:55,181 --> 02:08:56,014
driving past it.

4763
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:56,973
Oh my God,

4764
02:08:56,980 --> 02:09:00,820
that bus almost got hit by a
plane that fell from the sky.

4765
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:01,820
It's like,

4766
02:09:01,820 --> 02:09:02,820
that's like a scene,

4767
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:04,090
a final destination.

4768
02:09:04,091 --> 02:09:09,091
16 or something one day when
we have magnetic UFO looking
things that can't even

4769
02:09:11,321 --> 02:09:13,600
run into each other cause they
have magnets on the outside.

4770
02:09:13,601 --> 02:09:14,434
So they go like this.

4771
02:09:15,010 --> 02:09:16,150
When they bounce off each other,

4772
02:09:17,350 --> 02:09:18,100
we'll look at,

4773
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:19,330
someone should get on crashes.

4774
02:09:19,450 --> 02:09:20,580
I think they're probably already on it,

4775
02:09:20,581 --> 02:09:21,250
I think.

4776
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:22,083
Yeah.

4777
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:23,171
Well they always talk about,

4778
02:09:23,171 --> 02:09:23,950
um,

4779
02:09:23,950 --> 02:09:24,281
when,

4780
02:09:24,281 --> 02:09:29,281
whenever like serious physicist discuss
the possibility of space travel,

4781
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:30,730
like interstellar space travel.

4782
02:09:31,150 --> 02:09:31,481
They,

4783
02:09:31,481 --> 02:09:32,680
I'm like Stanton Freedman.

4784
02:09:32,681 --> 02:09:33,171
Like how,

4785
02:09:33,171 --> 02:09:34,360
how could aliens be doing it?

4786
02:09:34,570 --> 02:09:37,240
One of the things they always concentrate
on some sort of magnetic drive.

4787
02:09:37,450 --> 02:09:38,050
Hmm.

4788
02:09:38,050 --> 02:09:38,883
The um,

4789
02:09:39,190 --> 02:09:40,210
the uh,

4790
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:40,840
guide,

4791
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:42,250
Dr Robert Lasar,

4792
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:47,580
he's a often criticized gentlemen
who claimed to work at area 51.

4793
02:09:48,190 --> 02:09:50,170
But whether or not that
got told the truth,

4794
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:51,040
I don't know.

4795
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:51,670
But uh,

4796
02:09:51,670 --> 02:09:55,750
he described and some sort
of back engineering that
they were doing at area 51.

4797
02:09:55,751 --> 02:09:57,340
And it was some sort of magnetic drive.

4798
02:09:58,080 --> 02:09:58,870
The idea is that,

4799
02:09:58,870 --> 02:09:59,111
you know,

4800
02:09:59,111 --> 02:09:59,944
you figure out how to,

4801
02:10:00,430 --> 02:10:02,080
he's magnets or something to overcome,

4802
02:10:02,081 --> 02:10:07,081
gravitating to create like a little
hole in space and time and then just fly

4803
02:10:07,511 --> 02:10:08,344
around through that.

4804
02:10:09,340 --> 02:10:11,200
Whatever the fuck I even said Dan Hardee,

4805
02:10:11,201 --> 02:10:12,290
I don't even mind.

4806
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:13,001
I shouldn't,

4807
02:10:13,001 --> 02:10:16,330
it shouldn't be legal for me to say what
I just said because I don't even know

4808
02:10:16,331 --> 02:10:17,164
what the fuck it means.

4809
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:18,790
Wow.

4810
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:20,440
I got ready into aliens
when I was younger.

4811
02:10:20,590 --> 02:10:21,460
When I was in my teens.

4812
02:10:21,461 --> 02:10:22,750
It was like everything was aliens.

4813
02:10:23,020 --> 02:10:26,830
I really hope I got to experience
some kind of contact before I die.

4814
02:10:27,050 --> 02:10:28,930
Do you see this latest disclosure,

4815
02:10:28,931 --> 02:10:32,710
these five days of a disclosure
hearings on Capitol Hill?

4816
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:33,410
No,

4817
02:10:33,410 --> 02:10:34,243
dude,

4818
02:10:34,370 --> 02:10:34,671
dude,

4819
02:10:34,671 --> 02:10:35,510
crazy shit.

4820
02:10:35,600 --> 02:10:36,411
All of these different,

4821
02:10:36,411 --> 02:10:36,801
yeah.

4822
02:10:36,801 --> 02:10:41,801
Well you know the real problem with
any sort of Ufo thing is that it looks

4823
02:10:41,871 --> 02:10:42,620
silly.

4824
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:43,251
It looks silly.

4825
02:10:43,251 --> 02:10:46,030
You saying you saw a Ufo
makes you a silly person,

4826
02:10:46,250 --> 02:10:51,250
more silly even than Iowasca cause at
least Iowasca has a great body of evidence

4827
02:10:51,951 --> 02:10:53,270
to support what's going on.

4828
02:10:53,271 --> 02:10:55,850
You know chemically what you're
saying that you saw a Ufo,

4829
02:10:55,851 --> 02:10:57,500
you immediately become a silly person.

4830
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:00,950
All these like former military people,

4831
02:11:00,951 --> 02:11:03,350
all these people that were
air traffic controllers,

4832
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:04,633
pilots,

4833
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:08,240
all these people report these
unbelievably unique experiences.

4834
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:10,010
And I don't know if they're
telling the truth or not,

4835
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:11,450
but if they were telling the truth,

4836
02:11:11,451 --> 02:11:15,050
if just one of these things
happened every now and again,

4837
02:11:15,110 --> 02:11:18,020
of course it would seem
ridiculous to us on the outside,

4838
02:11:18,350 --> 02:11:19,520
the people sitting down here,

4839
02:11:19,521 --> 02:11:20,120
it's,

4840
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:24,350
it's natural to criticize it and make
fun of it and laugh at it because it is

4841
02:11:24,351 --> 02:11:25,520
kind of crazy to think,

4842
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:27,650
but if just one of those is true,

4843
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:32,180
if just one of those are a real craft
from another dimension from another

4844
02:11:32,181 --> 02:11:33,014
planet,

4845
02:11:33,620 --> 02:11:35,120
you don't think that that's possible.

4846
02:11:35,140 --> 02:11:36,260
You are silly.

4847
02:11:36,590 --> 02:11:39,200
If you don't think that within from here,

4848
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:40,670
in every direction,

4849
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:42,260
infinite space,

4850
02:11:42,690 --> 02:11:42,960
what?

4851
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:43,791
What does that even mean?

4852
02:11:43,791 --> 02:11:45,080
We don't even know what
the fuck that means.

4853
02:11:45,210 --> 02:11:46,080
I can't even comprehend that.

4854
02:11:46,081 --> 02:11:48,000
It's gotta be something out that it's,

4855
02:11:48,170 --> 02:11:51,110
I think if we survive,

4856
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:55,610
if we little pesky humans figured out
how to keep going for another couple of

4857
02:11:55,610 --> 02:11:55,640
million years,

4858
02:11:55,640 --> 02:11:59,570
who knows what the fuck we're going to
figure out to think that somebody else

4859
02:11:59,571 --> 02:12:00,410
can't be out there.

4860
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:02,420
And what would we do if
someone was out there?

4861
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:03,380
We would go check them out.

4862
02:12:03,410 --> 02:12:03,620
Yeah,

4863
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:04,170
of course.

4864
02:12:04,170 --> 02:12:04,701
Of course it.

4865
02:12:04,701 --> 02:12:05,121
Fuck yeah,

4866
02:12:05,121 --> 02:12:05,930
we check them out.

4867
02:12:05,930 --> 02:12:06,380
Yeah.

4868
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:07,490
We go to the Congo,

4869
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:08,781
we go to the Congo,

4870
02:12:08,781 --> 02:12:09,710
we check out tribes,

4871
02:12:09,711 --> 02:12:11,030
we check out tribes of fishermen.

4872
02:12:11,031 --> 02:12:12,350
They're hanging off fucking trees,

4873
02:12:12,351 --> 02:12:13,610
picking up fish with nets.

4874
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:14,960
We'd go watch him.

4875
02:12:15,150 --> 02:12:16,520
What'd you think about the theory of,

4876
02:12:16,521 --> 02:12:17,061
of the,

4877
02:12:17,061 --> 02:12:17,710
uh,

4878
02:12:17,710 --> 02:12:17,930
you know,

4879
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:18,141
the,

4880
02:12:18,141 --> 02:12:18,300
the,

4881
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:19,970
the interaction without a history and how,

4882
02:12:20,020 --> 02:12:21,860
and how they've helped guide us.

4883
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:23,450
It's all speculation.

4884
02:12:23,570 --> 02:12:24,950
It's complete speculation,

4885
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:27,320
but cause you don't know whether
or not you look at an ancient,

4886
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:28,540
when you look at ancient drawings,

4887
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:29,630
you don't know what's fantasy.

4888
02:12:29,631 --> 02:12:30,830
You don't know what's a story.

4889
02:12:31,070 --> 02:12:34,700
You don't know what's
their version of a fucking,

4890
02:12:34,790 --> 02:12:35,720
the Hobbit,

4891
02:12:35,950 --> 02:12:36,171
you know,

4892
02:12:36,171 --> 02:12:37,340
they might make up stories.

4893
02:12:37,341 --> 02:12:40,280
You know who else it could
be their version of twilight.

4894
02:12:40,310 --> 02:12:40,700
That's what,

4895
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:41,533
when you look at it,

4896
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:42,950
it aliens in the wall.

4897
02:12:42,951 --> 02:12:43,761
It's their version.

4898
02:12:43,761 --> 02:12:46,190
Like they told a stupid story
to make everybody go to sleep.

4899
02:12:46,210 --> 02:12:46,490
Yeah.

4900
02:12:46,490 --> 02:12:47,323
Who knows?

4901
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:48,740
We know that it's art.

4902
02:12:48,741 --> 02:12:49,031
We,

4903
02:12:49,031 --> 02:12:49,221
we,

4904
02:12:49,221 --> 02:12:50,180
we've seen in,

4905
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:53,750
in their art these depictions that
closely resemble what we would think to be

4906
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:54,411
alien.

4907
02:12:54,411 --> 02:12:55,820
Spacecrafts are alien beings,

4908
02:12:55,821 --> 02:12:57,140
but we don't really know
what the fuck it is.

4909
02:12:57,141 --> 02:12:58,250
It's not that much evidence.

4910
02:12:58,550 --> 02:12:59,870
So small amount of evidence.

4911
02:13:00,290 --> 02:13:01,580
There's a few cool videos,

4912
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:02,330
you know that like,

4913
02:13:02,330 --> 02:13:02,571
hmm,

4914
02:13:02,571 --> 02:13:03,200
what is that?

4915
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:04,030
Oh the fuck that is,

4916
02:13:04,030 --> 02:13:04,880
I don't even know if it's real.

4917
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:06,313
It's hard to tell.

4918
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:07,071
But if it happened to you,

4919
02:13:07,071 --> 02:13:07,281
man,

4920
02:13:07,281 --> 02:13:08,330
you'd fucking know.

4921
02:13:08,810 --> 02:13:10,010
And that's what you can't discount.

4922
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:12,950
You can't discount the
possibility of unique experience.

4923
02:13:14,690 --> 02:13:16,550
But once you've had a DMT trip,

4924
02:13:16,551 --> 02:13:18,560
aliens seem like so passe.

4925
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:20,210
It's like,

4926
02:13:20,210 --> 02:13:21,650
it's just kind of matter of fact,

4927
02:13:22,050 --> 02:13:23,030
I think it is kind of like,

4928
02:13:23,031 --> 02:13:23,211
well,

4929
02:13:23,211 --> 02:13:23,361
yeah,

4930
02:13:23,361 --> 02:13:23,930
of course.

4931
02:13:23,930 --> 02:13:24,770
Well not only that,

4932
02:13:24,771 --> 02:13:27,740
it's like to have that experience like a,

4933
02:13:27,741 --> 02:13:29,870
a ship lands and they get out.

4934
02:13:29,871 --> 02:13:31,530
It would be so less bizarre.

4935
02:13:31,550 --> 02:13:31,760
Yeah,

4936
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:33,570
because it's all taking place right here.

4937
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:34,860
You can say it's external.

4938
02:13:34,890 --> 02:13:35,701
What's taking place.

4939
02:13:35,701 --> 02:13:37,860
Also in the dimension that
we're comfortable with,

4940
02:13:38,070 --> 02:13:41,520
where we can walk on the grass and
feel the grass where we step on rocks.

4941
02:13:41,521 --> 02:13:42,930
We feel the rocks and our shoe.

4942
02:13:43,050 --> 02:13:44,610
Your car's parked over there,

4943
02:13:44,611 --> 02:13:48,240
you see the clouds above you and then
everything is basically normal except this

4944
02:13:48,241 --> 02:13:51,390
new introduced element into your
environment you have now except,

4945
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:51,851
oh,

4946
02:13:51,851 --> 02:13:54,690
it was a fucking little
dude from another planet.

4947
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:55,441
Holy Shit.

4948
02:13:55,441 --> 02:13:56,340
This really is true.

4949
02:13:56,550 --> 02:13:59,760
That's nothing compared to
a DMT trip cause a DMT trip.

4950
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:03,810
The dimension that you exist
in becomes of a vibrant,

4951
02:14:03,811 --> 02:14:08,400
glowing colors with no background and
constantly changing geometric patterns

4952
02:14:08,401 --> 02:14:10,350
that are there fractal and their infinite.

4953
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:12,540
That's way crazier than an alien landing.

4954
02:14:12,570 --> 02:14:13,150
Yeah.

4955
02:14:13,150 --> 02:14:15,960
The thing is like where
we're in an environment now
where particularly with the

4956
02:14:15,961 --> 02:14:16,381
Internet,

4957
02:14:16,381 --> 02:14:17,190
we,

4958
02:14:17,190 --> 02:14:19,380
we've effectively seen most things.

4959
02:14:19,381 --> 02:14:19,531
Like,

4960
02:14:19,531 --> 02:14:22,590
I remember when I was in China and I was
walking down the street with a friend

4961
02:14:22,591 --> 02:14:23,430
of mine who was like,

4962
02:14:23,450 --> 02:14:23,880
you know,

4963
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:28,880
230 pound red black dude and these
Chinese dudes would just ignore it.

4964
02:14:30,091 --> 02:14:30,390
They just,

4965
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:31,071
they just stood,

4966
02:14:31,071 --> 02:14:32,790
stood and watched him as
he walked down the street.

4967
02:14:32,910 --> 02:14:33,930
Like the Green Mile.

4968
02:14:33,990 --> 02:14:34,621
Exactly.

4969
02:14:34,621 --> 02:14:35,430
So then you know,

4970
02:14:35,430 --> 02:14:35,820
like,

4971
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:37,500
and then think back to like a,

4972
02:14:37,890 --> 02:14:38,723
I dunno,

4973
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:39,961
you know,

4974
02:14:39,961 --> 02:14:40,090
when,

4975
02:14:40,090 --> 02:14:43,110
when when the Romans were fighting
different tribes and they were taking

4976
02:14:43,111 --> 02:14:43,950
elephants with them.

4977
02:14:43,951 --> 02:14:45,570
Like when they took the
elephants to Britannia,

4978
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:46,081
like there's a,

4979
02:14:46,081 --> 02:14:46,410
there's a,

4980
02:14:46,410 --> 02:14:48,870
there's a tube station in London
called elephant and castle,

4981
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:49,700
which was,

4982
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:50,010
you know,

4983
02:14:50,010 --> 02:14:51,420
this elephant crossing,

4984
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:56,460
crossing this plane with this dude
sitting on top riding in it and the Bob

4985
02:14:56,461 --> 02:14:59,520
errands that were living there at the
time just lost their shit and ran away.

4986
02:14:59,730 --> 02:14:59,971
Like,

4987
02:14:59,971 --> 02:15:00,631
why wouldn't you,

4988
02:15:00,631 --> 02:15:01,464
you know what I mean?

4989
02:15:01,680 --> 02:15:04,620
But we don't have those experiences
anymore because we've seen everything.

4990
02:15:04,621 --> 02:15:05,131
Or you know,

4991
02:15:05,131 --> 02:15:06,220
we might see something that's a,

4992
02:15:06,660 --> 02:15:07,411
a new species,

4993
02:15:07,411 --> 02:15:10,020
but it's only a variation of something
that's already familiar to us.

4994
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:10,591
Like,

4995
02:15:10,591 --> 02:15:12,330
imagine seeing an elephant
for the first time.

4996
02:15:12,331 --> 02:15:13,620
If you've lived in like,

4997
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:14,491
I don't know,

4998
02:15:14,491 --> 02:15:15,324
England,

4999
02:15:15,510 --> 02:15:16,343
Jesus Christ,

5000
02:15:16,350 --> 02:15:17,340
it would blow your mind.

5001
02:15:17,670 --> 02:15:19,500
When did they know that elephants existed?

5002
02:15:19,501 --> 02:15:22,110
When was the first
documented by Western world?

5003
02:15:22,140 --> 02:15:23,490
Obviously Africans,

5004
02:15:23,820 --> 02:15:24,570
you know,

5005
02:15:24,570 --> 02:15:25,051
listen to this,

5006
02:15:25,051 --> 02:15:25,884
go bitch.

5007
02:15:26,040 --> 02:15:26,871
We've known about it.

5008
02:15:26,871 --> 02:15:29,010
I'll find it for 70,000 years.

5009
02:15:30,030 --> 02:15:31,320
When did you figure it out?

5010
02:15:31,321 --> 02:15:32,154
At a fun.

5011
02:15:33,710 --> 02:15:34,290
When did,

5012
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:34,561
oh,

5013
02:15:34,561 --> 02:15:39,561
when did the civilized folk learn
of the larger animals on the plains?

5014
02:15:40,220 --> 02:15:40,560
You know,

5015
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:41,550
when did they discover,

5016
02:15:41,551 --> 02:15:43,080
when did people discover elephants all?

5017
02:15:43,081 --> 02:15:46,740
It wasn't until 1900
people got down there.

5018
02:15:46,741 --> 02:15:51,270
Proper people might do when the
explorers likes first saw a giraffe.

5019
02:15:51,330 --> 02:15:51,841
Yeah.

5020
02:15:51,841 --> 02:15:52,950
How much would that blow your mind?

5021
02:15:53,010 --> 02:15:53,131
Well,

5022
02:15:53,131 --> 02:15:54,750
I guess we grew up with them though,

5023
02:15:54,751 --> 02:15:55,171
didn't we?

5024
02:15:55,171 --> 02:15:55,501
I mean,

5025
02:15:55,501 --> 02:15:55,940
if,

5026
02:15:55,940 --> 02:16:00,750
if you believe that human
life and emanated from the
lower hominids that existed

5027
02:16:00,751 --> 02:16:03,630
in Africa and came down from the
rain forest into the grasslands,

5028
02:16:03,631 --> 02:16:04,830
we would have probably been around them.

5029
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:06,630
But what they would they have not to,

5030
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:08,560
which is still not seem unfamiliar if you,

5031
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:09,660
if you,

5032
02:16:09,660 --> 02:16:10,890
if you were from like Mongolia.

5033
02:16:11,070 --> 02:16:11,401
Oh yeah.

5034
02:16:11,401 --> 02:16:13,710
Then it'd be alien fun
if you came over from,

5035
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:17,790
I mean essentially if you go anywhere
where you haven't been there before and

5036
02:16:17,791 --> 02:16:18,660
they have some new shit,

5037
02:16:18,661 --> 02:16:19,021
you're like,

5038
02:16:19,021 --> 02:16:21,180
what are you doing with
fucking Kangaroos everywhere?

5039
02:16:21,820 --> 02:16:22,560
What the fuck?

5040
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:23,960
Well I have a friend
named Eddie [inaudible],

5041
02:16:24,020 --> 02:16:25,990
he's a standup comic and uh,

5042
02:16:26,090 --> 02:16:26,900
he's done very well,

5043
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:26,900
very

5044
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:29,230
well in Australia and he
goes over there quite a bit.

5045
02:16:29,231 --> 02:16:29,980
And one of the things

5046
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,830
he told me was that he first
encountered a kangaroo.

5047
02:16:33,010 --> 02:16:35,500
Kangaroos have killed
people like many times.

5048
02:16:35,501 --> 02:16:37,420
Like they will fucking rip you apart.

5049
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:40,240
And he didn't know how big bank got.

5050
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:41,190
There's two kangaroos.

5051
02:16:41,191 --> 02:16:42,190
It's like a red one and a gray one.

5052
02:16:42,191 --> 02:16:42,730
I guess.

5053
02:16:42,730 --> 02:16:43,690
One of them is giant,

5054
02:16:43,740 --> 02:16:44,980
one of them's like nine feet tall.

5055
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:48,760
And he was out in this guy's yard and he
saw this kangaroo and he thought it was

5056
02:16:48,761 --> 02:16:50,680
a statue cause it was too big.

5057
02:16:51,070 --> 02:16:52,540
He started walking towards it.

5058
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:53,291
So it was like,

5059
02:16:53,291 --> 02:16:54,520
cause it was nine feet tall.

5060
02:16:54,550 --> 02:16:54,881
Wow.

5061
02:16:54,881 --> 02:16:55,714
And he was like,

5062
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:57,410
well that's not really
a kangaroo kangaroos.

5063
02:16:57,420 --> 02:17:00,610
I get that tall and his
friends go stop walking.

5064
02:17:00,611 --> 02:17:02,560
I turn around now,

5065
02:17:02,890 --> 02:17:06,670
get the fuck away from that thing and
tango like looks at them and all sudden

5066
02:17:06,671 --> 02:17:07,180
suddenly realize,

5067
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:07,961
oh Jesus,

5068
02:17:07,961 --> 02:17:09,690
this is a nine foot squirreled.

5069
02:17:09,691 --> 02:17:11,230
It's about the fuck me up.

5070
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:13,370
That's a scary thought.

5071
02:17:13,400 --> 02:17:16,480
It's a nine foot jumping squirrel
that will kick your guts out.

5072
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:17,710
Yeye

5073
02:17:18,250 --> 02:17:19,000
but the thing is like,

5074
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,400
like my points to Sunday,

5075
02:17:20,430 --> 02:17:20,641
he's,

5076
02:17:20,641 --> 02:17:22,870
or he's still seeing what
occurring kangaroo looks like,

5077
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:25,480
even if even if he's not
expats in the nine foot one.

5078
02:17:25,670 --> 02:17:25,960
Right.

5079
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:27,070
Like even if,

5080
02:17:27,071 --> 02:17:27,161
uh,

5081
02:17:27,161 --> 02:17:29,530
even if a velociraptor showed
it right now in this room,

5082
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:30,251
you know,

5083
02:17:30,251 --> 02:17:31,060
we've seen it,

5084
02:17:31,060 --> 02:17:31,720
we've kind of see it,

5085
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:33,820
we kind of know what they
look light and no surprises,

5086
02:17:34,210 --> 02:17:35,380
but an alien landing.

5087
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:38,290
Is that still kind of
a shock to the system?

5088
02:17:38,470 --> 02:17:39,670
But then again on top of that,

5089
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:43,180
the DMT Rome is completely
removed altogether.

5090
02:17:43,310 --> 02:17:43,551
Yeah.

5091
02:17:43,551 --> 02:17:44,121
And aliens.

5092
02:17:44,121 --> 02:17:46,730
The problem I always have with aliens
as they look so much like us in the

5093
02:17:46,731 --> 02:17:47,564
future.

5094
02:17:47,750 --> 02:17:48,440
Yeah.

5095
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:50,580
I always wonder whether or not light,

5096
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:51,800
I mean the big,

5097
02:17:51,801 --> 02:17:52,634
the grand theories,

5098
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:55,880
the simulation theory that we're
living inside some sort of a artificial

5099
02:17:55,881 --> 02:17:56,714
reality.

5100
02:17:56,750 --> 02:18:01,010
And that the aliens are us and that's why
we have this weird image of that being

5101
02:18:01,011 --> 02:18:01,671
us in the future.

5102
02:18:01,671 --> 02:18:03,710
We're already there and
we didn't like it sucks.

5103
02:18:03,740 --> 02:18:04,221
It's boring.

5104
02:18:04,221 --> 02:18:04,351
We,

5105
02:18:04,351 --> 02:18:04,910
we,

5106
02:18:04,910 --> 02:18:07,820
we sort of evolve the fun out of life.

5107
02:18:08,030 --> 02:18:11,870
So we've created this crazy
simulation that we all exist in.

5108
02:18:12,470 --> 02:18:13,520
That's the grand theory.

5109
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:16,400
That's the grand theory involving
the aliens for me at least,

5110
02:18:16,900 --> 02:18:20,840
if that's why they look like us and
that's why they have big black things for

5111
02:18:20,841 --> 02:18:21,674
their eyes.

5112
02:18:21,680 --> 02:18:25,010
We fucked the environment so hard that
you have to have sunglasses everywhere.

5113
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:26,240
Everywhere you go,

5114
02:18:26,510 --> 02:18:28,190
you have to have built in sunglasses.

5115
02:18:28,340 --> 02:18:30,560
So we just artificially create
sunglasses for each other.

5116
02:18:30,561 --> 02:18:32,900
Just put giant fucking black
things every guy has done.

5117
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:33,070
They,

5118
02:18:33,070 --> 02:18:36,920
I don't worry about the fucking hyper
violent raise or whatever's out there and

5119
02:18:36,921 --> 02:18:37,680
with Jack and you,

5120
02:18:37,680 --> 02:18:39,500
we have really long fingers from texting.

5121
02:18:39,650 --> 02:18:40,483
Exactly.

5122
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:44,880
Well at that point in time you probably
control everything with your mind so you

5123
02:18:44,881 --> 02:18:45,100
can,

5124
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:46,310
this is probably no need for muscles.

5125
02:18:46,350 --> 02:18:47,240
That's why they're so skinny.

5126
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:50,420
There's a little tiny dudes with giant
heads and they control everything with

5127
02:18:50,421 --> 02:18:51,254
their minds.

5128
02:18:51,350 --> 02:18:51,741
Do you think?

5129
02:18:51,741 --> 02:18:53,720
Do you think we could potentially
evolve to that statement?

5130
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:54,673
Questionably?

5131
02:18:55,010 --> 02:18:56,120
No doubt about it.

5132
02:18:56,350 --> 02:18:58,370
Even with the clicking send to this day,

5133
02:18:58,570 --> 02:18:59,020
I might,

5134
02:18:59,020 --> 02:19:01,190
this computer's not hooked
up to anything Dan Hardee,

5135
02:19:01,430 --> 02:19:02,450
but yet it's on the Internet.

5136
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:05,270
It's getting the Internet
through the space around us.

5137
02:19:05,510 --> 02:19:05,871
You know,

5138
02:19:05,871 --> 02:19:08,990
you're telling me that that can eventually
be humidity consciousness itself,

5139
02:19:08,991 --> 02:19:10,070
traveling through space,

5140
02:19:10,100 --> 02:19:12,370
through some sort of a mechanism for,

5141
02:19:12,371 --> 02:19:12,631
for,

5142
02:19:12,631 --> 02:19:16,910
for generating it or promoting it or
projecting it have to fart theory and it's

5143
02:19:16,990 --> 02:19:17,823
calming.

5144
02:19:18,660 --> 02:19:18,950
None.

5145
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:19,783
As far

5146
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:22,220
my alien fart theory is this.

5147
02:19:22,550 --> 02:19:23,060
Um,

5148
02:19:23,060 --> 02:19:25,280
if someone farted and you
didn't have a sense of smell,

5149
02:19:25,281 --> 02:19:28,710
you'd have no idea that you're sitting
in someone's cause you can't see it.

5150
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:29,521
You know,

5151
02:19:29,521 --> 02:19:30,370
you'd really don't know.

5152
02:19:30,371 --> 02:19:32,100
In Florence are like a real far.

5153
02:19:32,110 --> 02:19:32,370
You're like,

5154
02:19:32,370 --> 02:19:34,080
oh my God and you'll get the fuck out.

5155
02:19:34,110 --> 02:19:34,800
You close your mouth,

5156
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:36,870
but you don't see a damn thing somehow.

5157
02:19:36,871 --> 02:19:39,270
I know that you've been
affected by something that
you didn't pick up with your

5158
02:19:39,271 --> 02:19:41,670
normal senses or with all
of your normal senses.

5159
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,980
You heard it and then you smelled it,

5160
02:19:43,981 --> 02:19:44,910
but you saw nothing.

5161
02:19:45,090 --> 02:19:45,691
How do we not know?

5162
02:19:45,691 --> 02:19:49,170
There's not an infinite amount of things
all around us all the time that we just

5163
02:19:49,171 --> 02:19:50,850
do not have the ability to detach.

5164
02:19:51,370 --> 02:19:51,850
Quantify.

5165
02:19:51,850 --> 02:19:52,683
So that's your argument.

5166
02:19:52,690 --> 02:19:54,090
People that laugh at you
when you use the word,

5167
02:19:54,530 --> 02:19:55,770
we use the term energy.

5168
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:59,160
I'm going to start talking about
energy and stuff and like Bros delay.

5169
02:19:59,190 --> 02:19:59,641
Oh yeah,

5170
02:19:59,641 --> 02:19:59,821
yeah,

5171
02:19:59,821 --> 02:20:00,181
whatever.

5172
02:20:00,181 --> 02:20:00,670
Whatever.

5173
02:20:00,670 --> 02:20:01,670
Bros.

5174
02:20:01,670 --> 02:20:02,281
Bros are always problems.

5175
02:20:02,281 --> 02:20:03,330
It's always my fault though,

5176
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:03,751
Ken.

5177
02:20:03,751 --> 02:20:04,584
Smell fart.

5178
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:04,891
Yeah.

5179
02:20:04,891 --> 02:20:06,000
And you don't know what the fuck that is.

5180
02:20:06,001 --> 02:20:06,810
That's energy.

5181
02:20:06,810 --> 02:20:07,320
Yeah.

5182
02:20:07,320 --> 02:20:08,010
Yeah.

5183
02:20:08,010 --> 02:20:09,060
And the bigger the dude monk,

5184
02:20:09,061 --> 02:20:10,500
likely the more energy's going to put.

5185
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:11,393
As

5186
02:20:12,510 --> 02:20:13,320
you know.

5187
02:20:13,320 --> 02:20:13,531
I mean,

5188
02:20:13,531 --> 02:20:16,620
if Tony Hinchcliffe Arts of Joey d as
far as which one do you want to lean?

5189
02:20:16,860 --> 02:20:17,730
Do you mean with Tony?

5190
02:20:17,731 --> 02:20:18,300
Queefs.

5191
02:20:18,300 --> 02:20:18,560
Come on.

5192
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:19,393
Hey,

5193
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:21,360
come on man.

5194
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:22,510
Listen.

5195
02:20:22,510 --> 02:20:23,041
Jann harder.

5196
02:20:23,041 --> 02:20:24,000
You're a bad motherfucker.

5197
02:20:24,690 --> 02:20:25,700
I'll have you on anytime.

5198
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:26,131
You're around,

5199
02:20:26,131 --> 02:20:26,311
man.

5200
02:20:26,311 --> 02:20:27,210
Anytime you want to come back.

5201
02:20:27,211 --> 02:20:27,750
Let's we could,

5202
02:20:27,750 --> 02:20:28,561
we could do this for,

5203
02:20:28,561 --> 02:20:29,251
I have to leave.

5204
02:20:29,251 --> 02:20:30,600
Otherwise I would keep going forever.

5205
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:33,930
I think you and I could talk for a long
time and we've been friends for a long

5206
02:20:33,931 --> 02:20:34,171
time.

5207
02:20:34,171 --> 02:20:34,381
Man.

5208
02:20:34,381 --> 02:20:35,260
You're a cool motherfucker.

5209
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:37,170
I like you and I'm really,

5210
02:20:37,171 --> 02:20:38,300
I'm uh,

5211
02:20:38,310 --> 02:20:38,581
I'm,

5212
02:20:38,581 --> 02:20:41,610
I'm very appreciative of how
you're evolving as a human being.

5213
02:20:41,611 --> 02:20:45,050
I think it's really fascinating to
watch and I congratulate you on your,

5214
02:20:45,090 --> 02:20:45,840
on your travels.

5215
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:46,111
Thank you.

5216
02:20:46,111 --> 02:20:46,231
Well,

5217
02:20:46,231 --> 02:20:46,620
I'll be out,

5218
02:20:46,620 --> 02:20:48,090
I'll be out helping Mack out and stuff.

5219
02:20:48,270 --> 02:20:49,330
So you're going to be for awhile.

5220
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:51,870
I'll be around in
California and I'll kind of,

5221
02:20:51,950 --> 02:20:52,500
I'll start again.

5222
02:20:52,500 --> 02:20:53,760
Do it again in a couple
of weeks to do that.

5223
02:20:53,820 --> 02:20:54,510
Let's do it again.

5224
02:20:54,510 --> 02:20:55,201
Powerful Dan.

5225
02:20:55,201 --> 02:20:55,910
Hardee.

5226
02:20:55,910 --> 02:20:56,311
All right,

5227
02:20:56,311 --> 02:20:56,731
my brother.

5228
02:20:56,731 --> 02:20:57,091
Thank you,

5229
02:20:57,091 --> 02:20:57,390
sir.

5230
02:20:57,390 --> 02:20:58,223
Thank you.

5231
02:20:58,590 --> 02:21:01,350
Thank you everybody for
sponsoring this bad boy.

5232
02:21:01,630 --> 02:21:01,950
Uh,

5233
02:21:01,950 --> 02:21:03,300
thanks to Squarespace.

5234
02:21:03,570 --> 02:21:08,570
Go to squarespace.com forward slash
Joe and use the code Joe for to save

5235
02:21:09,001 --> 02:21:10,320
yourself some sheckles son.

5236
02:21:10,620 --> 02:21:11,453
Okay.

5237
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:12,840
Joe Rogan.

5238
02:21:13,950 --> 02:21:14,490
Okay.

5239
02:21:14,490 --> 02:21:15,031
If you,

5240
02:21:15,031 --> 02:21:15,810
uh,

5241
02:21:15,810 --> 02:21:17,380
I don't know where that
came from yourself.

5242
02:21:17,580 --> 02:21:17,941
