1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,880
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,040
two,
one.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,380
Mr Paige,
how are you?

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,150
I never had a bad day in my life.
Ever elevated.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,200
Plenty of bad moments.
Moments.

6
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:17,610
But you recovered.
Yeah.

7
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:18,444
You know,
um,

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,000
to me it's all your state of mind
period.

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,820
And I don't stay there.
If I go down,

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,730
I get back up.
If you're going to chew that pump,

11
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:29,090
we're going to go fucking crazy.
Well,

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,240
one of those in my mouth the other day,
like 150 comments because rope.

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,750
Well I got,
I got the throat coat.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,220
Yeah.
Um,

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,710
listen man.
First of all,

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,990
I love what you're doing.
I really do.

17
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:47,991
I think it's fantastic and I'm a big fan
of yoga and what you've done for not

18
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:54,030
just what you've done is made yoga
available to people that thought that

19
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:56,860
yoga was for chicks.
I and I,

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,940
I don't now.
It's funny you say that because how it

21
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:02,490
started,
it was yoga for regular.

22
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,700
It was regular people,
regular guys made it for guys.

23
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,940
People think of yoga as being something
that like you have to be into,

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,210
you know,
you gotta be all day and you hear Dallas

25
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:14,960
diamond page.
What the fuck or Diamond Dallas page

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,810
you,
how you know you're this giant pro

27
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:22,800
wrestler guy,
like you're in a yoga and you're really,

28
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,050
really into it.
I mean you've got your own system of

29
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,260
yoga.
I mean this is for,

30
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,920
for something that I think is very
important for body maintenance and for

31
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,570
keeping your spine healthy and mobility,
which is one of the things that a lot of

32
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:39,930
us ignore,
especially big guys who liked to lift

33
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:43,500
weights or do a lot of crazy.
Gosh,

34
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,340
Daniella,
I'm,

35
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,690
I'm the guy who wouldn't be caught dead
doing yoga the first 42 years of my

36
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,220
life,
but I didn't start wrestling.

37
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:52,470
I was 35 really,
really,

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,230
and my career didn't take off.

39
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,680
The was Ford.
How old are you now?

40
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,390
Sixty two.
Dude.

41
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,260
If you folks saw what he did with no
warmup,

42
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,310
no warm up,
Ben Dover,

43
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:05,970
grab your ankles fully,
fully flattened your body out.

44
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,790
Press your body up against your thighs
with no warmup.

45
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,960
Then he picks his knee,
his ankle up and fully extends his leg

46
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,530
over his head.
I mean that.

47
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,490
That is incredibly impressive for a 20
year old person.

48
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,060
It's all about staying ahead of it,
you know,

49
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,050
it's all about owning it.
I'm going back to just my career.

50
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,820
I mean my crew took off in [inaudible]
96,

51
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,940
which was I was 40 years old,
97 and 98 and I was on top of the world

52
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,300
wrestling 270 days a year every year.
And then I did the tonight show,

53
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,370
Hollywood squares,
a movie called the first daughter was my

54
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,300
first movie.
I did.

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,600
So I mean I was probably working 320
days a year and the wear and tear on

56
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,060
your body after awhile,
like boom,

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,180
I took a power slam from Laura power
bomb from Kevin Nash.

58
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,470
Kevin's legit six,
10

59
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,190
long way down and it wasn't that bump
that blew my back out.

60
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,910
It was all of it and being almost 43
years old and when I ruptured my l four

61
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,770
and l five and we have this amazing
vertebrae,

62
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,360
that is what allows us to do all this
crazy shit that we do but really allows

63
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:20,860
us is those shock absorbers are
absorbers those discs in between the

64
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:25,240
vertebrae.
We'll think of a jelly donut and slap

65
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:27,040
that Jelly donut.
And now there's nothing there.

66
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,550
So I have no desks in between my l four
or l five.

67
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,340
I was told by three different spine
specialists.

68
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,540
You're never going to wrestle again.
I just signed a multimillion dollar

69
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,450
three year deal.
So the guy who wouldn't be caught dead

70
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:43,840
doing yoga would do anything to get back
into a ring.

71
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:48,841
And I was married at the time and uh,
she kind of bullied me into it and once

72
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,950
I started doing a job,
just like,

73
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:54,800
you know,
I start filled difference and I thought

74
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,660
it'd thinking,
Wow,

75
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,500
now did you talk to any doctors that
wanted to replace your discs,

76
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:02,890
are fused your disks to one of the fuse
and one didn't.

77
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,760
And his thing was this a 1999.
So the beginning of those spacers that

78
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:12,340
they have now don't have anything discs
and have any of that.

79
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,790
And his whole thing was,
if we do fuse you and you go back,

80
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,270
you will be crippled because you won't
recover from that.

81
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,680
So again,
going to do yoga.

82
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,300
And I started doing Bryan kest.
Have you ever taken more Brian Class

83
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,570
classes are in la?
No,

84
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,420
he's amazing.
He went to yoga as a power yoga.

85
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:35,620
He's the guy who kind of put power yoga
on the map and he made me feel like,

86
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:37,300
okay,
that dude's cool.

87
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,490
Like,
and then today's a buddy of mine,

88
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:40,550
you know,
uh,

89
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,510
but at the time I was just doing as vhs
tapes,

90
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,740
but for what I wanted,
it wasn't getting me everything.

91
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,040
So what I did,
I've rehabbed both shoulder surgeries,

92
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,250
both knee surgeries,
and I'm Kinda like God given gifts of

93
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:59,620
figuring out how to heal myself.

94
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,190
I'm the first guy in professional
wrestling to ever ice isis body by

95
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:07,330
almost a decade,
eight years before they would start

96
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:09,280
doing that.
Do you mean like ice baths?

97
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,720
Like your shoulders back,
inflammation,

98
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,210
take it down.
I just got that.

99
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,890
How'd you figure that out?
Um,

100
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,030
you know,
just different reading on different know

101
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,720
people had,
how they healed themselves and what

102
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:25,480
people were saying.
And what I've found that a lot of people

103
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:29,290
don't want to put the extra work and
they can be the hardest workers ever,

104
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,460
but they won't go that extra mile just
to go get a bag of ice,

105
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,960
fill it up,
put it on your knees,

106
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:37,120
put an ace bandage around it.
You can go wherever you want.

107
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,910
Although it's also like part of the
culture of tough guys.

108
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,570
They don't give a fuck,
right?

109
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:43,240
Just go get a beer and have some food.

110
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,560
Right?
Just exhausted.

111
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,890
There's a little bit of that,
right?

112
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,590
There's something about the same type of
God.

113
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:51,970
It's so tough.
They can work 300 days a year.

114
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:55,780
It was also the same type of guy that's
going to go out and just deal with it.

115
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,760
And Steve Means Austin.
When I broke in,

116
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,880
I was like 35 and a half.
He's 26 and Austin was always way ahead

117
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:07,340
of the curve as far as talent.
But he wouldn't know.

118
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:08,091
He wouldn't.
He was like,

119
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:08,581
what are,
you know?

120
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:10,580
And cared.
Leah got those ice bags.

121
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,820
So back then we were drinking beers.
Not that it's right to do,

122
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:18,470
but back then we were,
and he would put the beers on my ice

123
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:20,150
bags in between my,
uh,

124
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,070
my ace bandage.
Just keep us beers cold.

125
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,470
A true story.
It's her story.

126
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,290
So,
you know,

127
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,940
the bottom line is I started to mix the
rehabilitation techniques with the yoga

128
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:34,970
positions.
Then I threw an old school calisthenics,

129
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,410
pushups,
squats,

130
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,140
crunches,
and I did them with the slow burn

131
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:41,930
movement because I had to.
And in the beginning I had to do them on

132
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:44,810
my knees.
So when you say slow burn movement,

133
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:47,690
this is what you were just shown me that
before we started the podcast,

134
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,200
a lot of dynamic tension exercise.
Exactly.

135
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,110
Which,
a lot of it,

136
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,710
Bruce Lee was into exactly what a lot of
that stuff.

137
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,470
Go look at Bruce Lee.
Did he ever have an ounce of fat on him?

138
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,860
The guy was shredded,
but yeah,

139
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,860
that whole time under tension thing,
something I call dynamic resistance.

140
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,650
I hated that.
And like for the pushups,

141
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,990
you know,
I would lower for three,

142
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,280
hold three inches off the ground for
three charter ranga,

143
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,260
come up for three,
lower for three,

144
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:21,740
hold for three,
then I'd go into Cobra in downdog and in

145
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,410
the beginning I had to do,
I'm on my knees,

146
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,810
but then I built that strength to get
off my knees.

147
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,570
And then three second pushups became
five,

148
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,210
five became 10,
10 became sets of 10.

149
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,820
If you go to my DDP Yoga,
facebook,

150
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,960
you'll see a video up there of me doing
all my 62nd birthday.

151
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:43,961
Well actually two days after 10,
ten second pushups at 62.

152
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,290
So my core strength is at a different
level.

153
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,100
I don't lift weights anymore.
I haven't really for 10 years because I

154
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:53,930
really don't need it and I don't need
the size.

155
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,860
I like being like 2:30.
The bottom line is what today is called

156
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,770
unbranding DDP.
Why?

157
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,930
Why?
Because I want people to stop calling

158
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:05,630
it.
Just yoga because it's so different now.

159
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,160
You've done a lot of yoga?
Yeah.

160
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,160
What you do,
I just took you through in that minute

161
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:12,530
and a half.
Is that like anything you've ever done

162
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:14,420
in a yoga studio now?
It's very different.

163
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,600
You what you were saying,
your dynamic tension thing definitely

164
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:20,000
adds another element to it.
And then I have fun with it,

165
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:20,834
man.
I got you.

166
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,550
I do shit like when you take your
endorse a lunge and you throw your arms

167
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:27,370
up.
I go superstar,

168
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,190
you know,
when we're,

169
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,350
when we're in a like a lunch or folding
folding were to explode into touchdown.

170
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,330
I'd say throw a little rick flare on the
end of that.

171
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:42,920
And is everybody explodes?
Just having people having fun.

172
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,850
I,
I did,

173
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:45,140
um,
a big event.

174
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,910
That was this weekend.
It was called all in and it's a um,

175
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,710
cody Rhodes who's,
uh,

176
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,460
the American dream,
dusty Rhodes son,

177
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,980
he's been in independent wrestling.
He was at the show,

178
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,180
wwe for 10 years.
And bottom line is he went away.

179
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,840
They left their guaranteed money,
that'd be like a half a million bucks,

180
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,700
left it and went to follow the dream
because he knew he was a main event guy

181
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,940
and him in these kids,
the young bucks they sold out.

182
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,970
This arena was 10,426 people in 29
minutes and 36 seconds to counted the

183
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:24,390
cow the second that'll they did because
it's a really big deal when you forget.

184
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:27,240
So out when you're an independent group,
you're not the wwe now.

185
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:29,610
That's insane.
It's insane how many different groups

186
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,580
are there now?
There's Nwa was wwe,

187
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,500
right?
There's Roy h,

188
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,770
there's the row as my buddy booker t
calls had down there in Houston and was

189
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,613
with billy.

190
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,370
Billy Corgan owns right now.
I'll tell you what the smell.

191
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,810
That's the batch.
Cody was going for the Nwa championship

192
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,300
against Nick who was just one of the
stuff,

193
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,640
studs up our business and um,
he uh,

194
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,310
that a hell of a match.
And uh,

195
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:04,080
Billy owns that title.
Now think about this Vince Mcmahon,

196
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,920
just just,
I want to say he was paid one point $2

197
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,410
billion by Fox for the programming for a
live show on Friday nights.

198
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:15,690
I'm not sure what the deal is at six
years or eight years,

199
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:20,691
but one point 2 billion and then I heard
there's another multibillion dollar

200
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:23,790
contract being out there,
comcast or something.

201
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:28,791
So that's like nfl stuff.
So when that kind of attention comes to

202
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:33,030
wrestling,
more people are going to be like,

203
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,740
Ooh,
I want to get involved in that.

204
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,430
And plus Vince really has taken it
mainstream and a different level.

205
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,530
Like back when we were killing it in the
nineties.

206
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,500
I mean we had the highest rated show on
cable television,

207
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:47,190
whether it was wcw or wwe APP.
Every week we are one,

208
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,480
two and three,
sometimes one,

209
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,141
two,
three and four.

210
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:52,950
Top four shows.
But our dollars that we could get for

211
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:57,150
the advertising was nothing like they're
getting today because they made it kid

212
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,890
friendly.
They changed that.

213
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,540
And it was brilliant by Vince,
you know,

214
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,680
uh,
it really,

215
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:06,420
it changed format.
But today it's about to go through

216
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:10,590
another boom and this whole independent
thing that cody and these young bucks

217
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:11,630
who are great kids,
uh,

218
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,473
did,
uh,

219
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,200
it really lit up that world.
And it's the same thing all over the

220
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:18,360
country.
I'm interested a world Japan's really

221
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:19,730
big right now.
And so is,

222
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:21,060
uh,
so is.

223
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:24,120
I'm a UK and Mexico.
The really,

224
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:24,660
really big.

225
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,810
One of the guys from the UFC,
mathew riddle just got signed to the

226
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:29,370
wwe.
He was heard that.

227
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,540
Yeah,
his story,

228
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,550
his camp,
it's kind of fucked up.

229
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:35,910
He got fired from the UFC for failing a
pot test.

230
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,160
And the crazy thing,
it's so crazy.

231
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:41,770
He left the guy smile.
She's right.

232
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,550
It's even more crazy that,
you know,

233
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:48,590
now it's legal right now.
Pot's legal and now the Numb,

234
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,470
the level that you can get tested for is
so much lower than anything that he got.

235
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,890
But I,
he enjoys it.

236
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:56,410
I don't think he's missing fighting.
You know,

237
00:11:56,411 --> 00:12:00,940
fighting is.
I know that pro wrestling is probably

238
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:04,090
harder on your body doing those 300 days
a year.

239
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,590
I mean,
I don't think there's anything like it

240
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,240
in all of entertainment.
I really don't.

241
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,050
I mean it's,
it's crazy to think that you are getting

242
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:15,640
body slammed and thrown into the ropes
and forearm slammed and all that shit's

243
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:17,500
going on 300 days a year.

244
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,730
It's really,
it really.

245
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,690
It's not fair.
Just really should be a way where you

246
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,910
could take some time off.
It doesn't make any sense.

247
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,990
When I was on Hollywood squares one time
so much.

248
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,310
So once your season,
when are you?

249
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,470
Nothing about wrestling.
I said Hilarious when I'm hurt,

250
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,690
you know,
but you know,

251
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:36,040
the bottom line not hurt,
injured,

252
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,150
injured ligaments like.
Yeah,

253
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:40,991
exactly.
Yeah.

254
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:44,910
You guys compete or perform hurt on a
regular basis.

255
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,200
I mean,
and so did the guys in the NFL,

256
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,530
so the guys in the UFC as well?
Absolutely.

257
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,140
I think with Matt Riddle,
it's like he's got a great personality

258
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,120
and you know,
it doesn't have to cut any weight

259
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:57,520
anymore and now he's gigantic and he's a
fun guy.

260
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:59,760
I think wwe is perfect for someone like
me.

261
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,520
I was down there.
I train a lot of the guys down to neck,

262
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,190
it's called nxt next and that's a.

263
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,860
These kids are unbelievable.
They're so talented,

264
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:12,450
but I bring my ddpy program down to them
and they're all on my hands.

265
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:14,620
So you're starting that early with these
guys.

266
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,540
So they plus I'm like,
you know,

267
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,710
again,
I'm 62,

268
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:20,890
their 24 to 28,
you know,

269
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:24,470
so they grew up watching me so it's much
easier for,

270
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,780
for me to get them to pay attention to
do is look at Chris Jericho,

271
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:32,500
he's one of the top stars in the world
and he is not with wwe right now.

272
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:32,970
He,
you know,

273
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,430
he comes and goes and he was at that
show all in.

274
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:39,490
He did a run in a surprise thing.
It blew the roof off.

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,300
He's going to be 48 in November.
He wrestles like he's 28.

276
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,410
He's been doing my program since he did
the same thing I did when he blew his

277
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:50,470
back out.
And three Dr said he was not going to

278
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:51,340
rustle anymore.

279
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,310
Five weeks later,
85 percent pain free,

280
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,400
three months later he headlined
Wrestlemania against Punk.

281
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,870
He talks about it all the time now.
How has your back today,

282
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:04,600
those same disks,
if I don't do it,

283
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,630
it's kind of like brushing your teeth.
You gotta brush your teeth.

284
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,240
I don't have to do it every single day,
but pretty much,

285
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,930
you know,
and when I wake up I might first 10

286
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:16,390
minutes,
why call it wake up man,

287
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,450
I feel I call it oil for the tin man and
woman.

288
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,220
And the real proof of this for me
because I'm the first transformation.

289
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,320
The bottom line is they said my career
was over when I was 42.

290
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,000
I started doing what now is called DDP.
Why three months,

291
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,400
less than three months later,
joy.

292
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,800
I was back in the ring at 42.
They said my career's over 43 on the

293
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:39,490
world champ.

294
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,670
And that's like getting our ads are
Oscar.

295
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,560
You know what I mean?
It's like you're the guy,

296
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:47,390
you deserve this.
When I yield the most eyes on you,

297
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,560
you know I was.
I was in a match with Hogan flair in

298
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,090
staying three.
Arguably.

299
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:56,060
Maybe he'll eat in the top five biggest
names ever.

300
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,730
And I walk out that world champion Ric
Flair,

301
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,880
took the diamond cutter in the middle.
It was Hogan.

302
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,660
Hogan gave me such a hug afterwards
like,

303
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,890
this is what this business supposed to
be.

304
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,100
That someone like you who known would
believe would ever be anyone could work

305
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:16,340
so hard that they would become the world
champ.

306
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:20,410
When I got my hall of fame ring a 2017
inside ahead.

307
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,930
Inscribed in here.
Work ethic equals dreams.

308
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,750
Explanation Point,
DDP.

309
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,950
And that's what it is.
You know,

310
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:29,630
I don't tell you anything.
You understand.

311
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,210
Putting the work in,
putting the work in is everything.

312
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,760
Now you're back to date.
Did you ever get an Mri on it?

313
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,320
Oh yeah,
I did all that well,

314
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:38,450
but now,
now no know I don't have any.

315
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,490
I don't.
If I don't do it,

316
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:43,460
if I'm on too many planes,
trains and automobiles,

317
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,240
you know,
then I'm going to get released.

318
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,040
But I know what to do.
I got to say to my wife and I swear to

319
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,140
God because every morning I do roll out
of bed.

320
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:53,060
Some nights you'd feel like you get hit
by a truck.

321
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,160
You know what I mean?
Sleeping is the worst thing for me

322
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:59,510
because I get in those positions that
I'm in and when I wake up I'm like,

323
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,230
Oh God,
but as soon as I do within eight

324
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:06,140
minutes,
I feel like a completely different

325
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,620
person.
So your disk though was completely gone?

326
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,400
No,
they're gone.

327
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,470
There was literally bone on bone.

328
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,850
And is it still like that?
Yeah,

329
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:15,710
but this is something I will try and
tell Joe,

330
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:18,980
which makes what I'm doing different
than regular yoga,

331
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,470
not just the.
I always say most Yogis are very,

332
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:26,471
not mistake ddpy way more t and a and I
met today the beginning,

333
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,260
but what I mean today is tone and
attitude because it's an attitude.

334
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:34,390
And so he switched it up.
He kept saying it worked,

335
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,160
it worked like that.
But,

336
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:37,910
uh,
you know,

337
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,680
it just,
it for me.

338
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,090
It's,
as you know,

339
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:45,230
this repetition is the mother of
learning where you do something the more

340
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:46,760
you own it.
And on that I want to,

341
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:48,920
I want to show you something that I
brought with me because I've been

342
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:52,050
waiting for your show to release this.
Oh,

343
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,740
I've got a new book coming out.
Ooh,

344
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,840
and no one seemed to cover yet and it is
taught here at Premiere Premiere and I'm

345
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:02,120
doing something I don't think anybody
I've ever has ever really done this.

346
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,470
Now this isn't the book itself,
this is just the cover since the plastic

347
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,210
plastic.
It's called positively unstoppable.

348
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,590
The Art of owning it.
Woo.

349
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,280
I like it.
What is it?

350
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,390
It's whatever the fuck you want to be.
Take that

351
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,640
diamond.
Dallas page pictures.

352
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,500
Beautiful.
Mick Foley wrote the the funniest,

353
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,550
most entertaining for what I want to get
that guy on the heights.

354
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,210
Hilarious.
Get that happen in a heartbeat.

355
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:33,950
He's friends with my friend Tony
Hinchcliffe,

356
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,630
who's a giant pro wrestling fan and it's
given me so much grief because Tony such

357
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:40,010
a fan,
I've made fun of wrestling because

358
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:44,630
Tony's a fan that
Tony is such a Dork for it.

359
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,060
They do this podcast at the comedy
store.

360
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,470
They,
what do they call it?

361
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:49,304
The four

362
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,390
know how and what is it not the four
horsemen?

363
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:55,080
No,
no,

364
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,913
no,
no.

365
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,750
They have a wrestling podcast that I was
just done two weeks ago.

366
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,140
Store horsemen.
The store horseman,

367
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,980
the,
so these comics from the comedy store,

368
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,380
gigantic pro wrestling fans show.
Tell him I'll set it up,

369
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:15,270
I'll set it up.
And they do like simulcasts,

370
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:19,390
like so while Wrestlemania is going on,
they'll do like,

371
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,460
they'll do a view like,
uh,

372
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,230
we,
we do a thing for the UFC sometimes

373
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:23,490
called the fight companion.
Sure.

374
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,700
While the fights are going on,
we'll,

375
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:26,770
we'll get a bunch of guys in here,
drink beers and.

376
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,360
Beautiful.
I love that they do that while

377
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,990
Wrestlemania is going on.
Right?

378
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,700
So it's a.
on that note,

379
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:36,460
Jake,
the snake Roberts is going to,

380
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:38,580
he just,
he's working a deal right now with

381
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,480
hooters and in,
in Vegas and they're talking about

382
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:44,960
giving them a room and he will do,
like,

383
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,350
might be Monday night raw.

384
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,340
Somebody contacted me about him as well.
Someone from his organization contacted

385
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:51,360
me.
And you helped him.

386
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,790
Yes.
And I,

387
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,300
I saw uh,
some sort of a program on television was

388
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,940
detailing you helping him get cleaned
and you getting him involved in Yoga.

389
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,690
What you're doing is really fucking
awesome because you're.

390
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,050
You're exposing something that I think
should be.

391
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,930
It just just be something that everybody
does.

392
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:13,050
I just really think that all athletes,
all people.

393
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,800
I think yoga is a life staple.
I really didn't know.

394
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:19,410
I do do.
When I got through that I got through

395
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:23,430
with wrestling.
I could have easily stepped into that

396
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:26,160
yoga community and what the whole
namaste a route,

397
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,700
but that's not who I am and I know that
the yoga people like they get it.

398
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,320
They don't need me.
The people who need me is all those

399
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:41,130
people that bitterly,
that have nobody.

400
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,400
They don't have any direction.
You see the disabled veteran that I

401
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:45,210
helped.
No,

402
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,580
I did not.
I going to show you.

403
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,900
Just amazed that you could do what you
do with no disks.

404
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,450
Just don't understand that because
everybody that I know that it's had no

405
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,360
discussed had like serious muscle
atrophy and because they didn't stay,

406
00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:00,880
didn't figure it out like I had to
figure it out.

407
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,270
What did you figure out the.
What did you do differently?

408
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,320
I love that shirt,
by the way.

409
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,860
Kills talent.
Yeah,

410
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:07,850
right.
What a fucking great church that you get

411
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:09,420
that.
That's my buddy josh.

412
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:13,500
You brought me in.
He's got a line called beverly kills.

413
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,770
That's a great shirt.
That's such a.

414
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,710
that's such a good point.
Does it really make the point?

415
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,820
I've been doing it because I knew you
would love it and I love the shirt.

416
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:25,110
I wear it all the time.

417
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,140
He's got a couple of them that are
really working so we can get that if

418
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,570
they wanted to buy the.
I think it's beverly [inaudible] dot

419
00:20:30,571 --> 00:20:31,830
com.
I'm pretty sure.

420
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,740
So this is Arthur Boorman.
This is disabled veteran.

421
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,800
This is what DDP Yoga is,
or ddpy.

422
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,080
Oh Jesus.
Is there a link for this where Jamie

423
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,730
could get ahold of it?
He could put it on the youtube.

424
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,740
Absolutely.
If you're going to DDP yoga dot

425
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,750
com@thebottomofDDPyoga.com is the video
of Arthur.

426
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,150
So let me show you this now.
Jay,

427
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,730
show Jamie the image of him so he could
look for it on your website.

428
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,210
If you don't go all the way to the
bottom of DDP Yoga.com,

429
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:03,310
it will be sitting at the bottom and uh,
what was wrong with Arthur?

430
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,450
Okay,
let me,

431
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:06,220
let me just tell you the backstory.
It's crazy.

432
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,700
Anyone who got my program 11 years ago,
it was just workouts period and we're

433
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,820
three different levels and the first one
was called 50 plus.

434
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:17,970
It's Kinda like what I'm doing today
where I'm,

435
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:22,540
where I'm helping people who are really
disabled and he is right there.

436
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,810
You want to watch it?
Sure.

437
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,200
Okay.
Can we play this on Youtube?

438
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,360
Started from the beginning.
Start from the beginning.

439
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:31,560
This is awesome.
Dr told me I'd never walk unassisted

440
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,403
again.
It says,

441
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,820
so for the people just listening,
it says,

442
00:21:38,821 --> 00:21:43,650
for 15 years doctors told me I would
never walk unassisted again.

443
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,460
And we're seeing this gentlemen with
those crutches,

444
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,350
cane things on his forearms.
I accepted this as fact.

445
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,480
I was a 47 year old disabled veteran and
I had basically given up.

446
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,220
I was injured as a paratrooper in the
Gulf War.

447
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:10,660
Too many jumps took its toll on his
back.

448
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,350
Oh Man.
Watch on his land and my knees.

449
00:22:14,351 --> 00:22:18,610
It says gained weight.
We just watched an image of it.

450
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:22,330
All this stuff is available online at
DDP Yoga Dot com,

451
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:23,090
right?
Is that what it is?

452
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,110
This video?
Yes.

453
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,870
This has got Mozillians and millions of
views.

454
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,980
That's a good number.
It says he couldn't walk.

455
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,450
Run exercise seemed impossible.

456
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,600
Most Yoga instructors turned me away.
It's music is killing me

457
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,650
all,
but one mother fucker

458
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,080
says he didn't know me,
but he believed in me when no one else

459
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:02,700
did.
How long is this

460
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,330
video?
I feel like the payoff is worth it.

461
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,720
I will get them doing it here in the
chair.

462
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,440
Hold on

463
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,060
two for balance.
Will to get up,

464
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:19,110
get down.
Like says I fell many times.

465
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,130
Yeah,
but I got back up.

466
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,210
It's all about getting back up,
right?

467
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,520
Yeah.
This is very impressive,

468
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:28,050
but just watching him do what he's doing
here.

469
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,260
This guy's got heart.
You know?

470
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:39,031
It's the attitude to do something even
though it's difficult and in pain is so

471
00:23:40,491 --> 00:23:42,950
damn important.
It is so important.

472
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,980
People have to force themselves to do
something and

473
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,800
this guy is one of the best examples of
that you're ever going to see.

474
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,420
I mean,
who?

475
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,360
Who had a better excuse to give up then
this guy.

476
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,890
Wow,
look at all this weight.

477
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,660
He's lost.
This is crazy.

478
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:03,610
He's a teacher in Baltimore.
He's lost a shitload of weight.

479
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:06,970
It looks like he's lost like eight
inches off of his belly

480
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,910
at least since I started to believe that
it could happen.

481
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,490
So in this,
uh,

482
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,160
this progress that you're seeing them
trying to walk without his cane and

483
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:21,880
fallen down flat on his face.
Yeah.

484
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,600
Starting to build his core strength.

485
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,430
This is crazy.
He's getting ready to do handstands now.

486
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,590
Oh my God.
If I crashed fucking China cabinet,

487
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:39,480
I love it.
It's going to kill the cat.

488
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,810
Get out of their cat.
He just said,

489
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:44,830
just because I can't do it today doesn't
mean it won't be able to do it someday.

490
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,140
A look at them here,
man.

491
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,580
Full pushups.
Wow.

492
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:51,420
Walk in with one cane now.
That's incredible.

493
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,560
What a difference in his posture and
everything.

494
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:59,530
Look how much weight he's lost.
And how often was he doing at every day?

495
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,920
Every day.
Sometimes twice a day.

496
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,300
So remember the pictures I showed you.
Right?

497
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,810
Check this.
I couldn't stand on two legs.

498
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,290
Now he's standing on one and holding his
foot up in the air.

499
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:12,930
That is insane.
Look out slimmy got holy Shit.

500
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:16,980
He lost 100 pounds in six months.
And he's holding that cat.

501
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:18,900
That cat is gonna die.
I told that cat get out.

502
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,750
Holy Shit.
He's running.

503
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,660
That is insane.
He's not just walking.

504
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:30,930
He's running Springton.
Holy Shit.

505
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:36,470
That is incredible.
That really is incredible.

506
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:44,740
Wow.
Look how fucking slamming he is.

507
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,450
That is really amazing.
What is the name of says?

508
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,350
Never give up.
What is the theme of this video so

509
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:52,330
people can find a.
never give up.

510
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,450
If you go to DDP Yoga Dot com and traded
the bottle.

511
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,660
Look at him.
Look at the difference.

512
00:25:58,661 --> 00:26:03,010
And he looks like he's 10 years younger.
Lost 140 pounds in 10 months.

513
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,690
Holy Wait,
wait,

514
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:04,961
wait,
wait,

515
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:05,290
wait,
wait,

516
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,810
wait.
Whoa.

517
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,530
That is crazy.
Standing on his head.

518
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,520
That is crazy.
That is crazy.

519
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,860
That's so amazing,
man.

520
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,960
I'm going to show you a picture that no
one's seen this.

521
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:23,670
I'm saving this for a Ted talk that to
do and if everybody asked me a couple of

522
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:25,840
times to do it and I just wasn't ready,
but now I am.

523
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,130
I'm just waiting.
I'm waiting.

524
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:29,860
Eventually they're going to get a hold
of me again and I'm going to do it and

525
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:31,790
I'm going to base it around a crying
man.

526
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,760
A dud choke you up,
right?

527
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,810
I told you it was a payoff.
I mean like strong am I my business

528
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:38,501
partner.
Steve.

529
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:43,501
You put that together and I literally
did it with his son originally

530
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,100
and it was pretty good,
but steve just took it like he's the

531
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,710
same guy who directed the resurrection
of Jake the snake.

532
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:55,040
So let me finish with him in six months
and 10 months he lost the 140 pounds,

533
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:59,640
but fuck the weight because this is not
about weight loss.

534
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:03,180
It's just an awesome side effect.
And think about that with my shit.

535
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,690
You could lose weight,
but you know you can't out train a bad

536
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,470
diet.
So you got to do everything you've got

537
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:10,470
to,
more than anything,

538
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,710
change your mindset,
which is what positive.

539
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:16,530
The unstopables all about.
Changing your mindset have been owning

540
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,230
that inner voice.
The story you tell yourself.

541
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,140
So art for the last hundred and 40
pounds,

542
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,490
more importantly,
lots of knee braces,

543
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:24,420
back,
braces and canes.

544
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:25,960
Lost the neighbor.
No more knee braces.

545
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,750
Knee braces.
How did he do that?

546
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,663
Well,
let me finish.

547
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,000
Get knee braces and canes.
Not just to walk but run.

548
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,610
But this is what the program is really
about.

549
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,050
At one year he's five slash six so it
can put you over six foot two son.

550
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,680
That's insane.
Standing on his back while he's doing a

551
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:45,570
pushup in one year.
One year.

552
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,310
That's great.
Imagine if you didn't see him for a

553
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,030
year.
Hey males,

554
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,470
go have lunch.
I haven't seen you in a long time.

555
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,180
Like Woo Hoo,
fuck where's our.

556
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,360
And and that's really like.
It was crazy because again,

557
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:59,670
anybody,
you've got my program 11 years ago,

558
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,670
I personally,
there was no one else but me,

559
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,460
I would send me an email saying,
hey man,

560
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,580
I'm not trying to sell you anything.
You already bought the program and I

561
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:12,420
want to say thank you and I got a couple
of questions if you would answer my

562
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:13,254
depreciate it.

563
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:18,260
His answers were so good that I wrote
him back and I'd never written anybody

564
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:23,010
like directly that I did know at this
time and I wrote him back and I said,

565
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:24,600
it sounds like you need some help bro.
I said,

566
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,060
what's your story?
Cliff notes,

567
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,490
disabled veteran,
morbidly obese,

568
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,330
relegated to thinking of himself as a
piece of furniture.

569
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,480
So I say send me some pictures so I can
see what I was working with.

570
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,260
And those are the pictures,
those first two with the canes.

571
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,150
And I was like,
fuck man.

572
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:44,550
I don't know how I could help him
because it's not so much the knee

573
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:45,141
braces.
Hell,

574
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:49,140
I wore knee braces my whole career.
I didn't realize it was strapped to a

575
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:52,380
back brace in his wife 20 minutes every
morning.

576
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,900
Got To put it on the sleeve,
put on the brakes because he can't even

577
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:58,260
bend over enough to do it and so she
puts them all together.

578
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,800
Twenty minutes later he's going to the
bathroom with his canes,

579
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,650
so I sent them this food plan,
which is like my face,

580
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:08,430
three eating plan is for health,
but I got it from a guy named Dr Fred

581
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:10,980
vishy at a time.
Fred was 78,

582
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,550
could still run 20 miles on the beach in
the.

583
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,360
In the deep sand with my brother,
like as his mentor.

584
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:20,630
He helped people with cancer and all
sorts of shit.

585
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,060
This guy's like,
he's just a different level of lip

586
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,660
walking the talk.
So you have a food plan level was an

587
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:30,800
exercise plan and what kind of food you
got meet meeting.

588
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,550
Well this is what I like to do.
Let's go back to what God created.

589
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,870
Shit that's not genetically modified.
Alright Shit.

590
00:29:39,871 --> 00:29:44,871
This not sprayed with chemicals,
so let's call it organic or like your

591
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:50,140
great grandparents used to call it
fucking food.

592
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,170
Like is everything go to Italy,
go to France.

593
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,210
They don't just say,
can I have the organic vegetables?

594
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:55,990
I go,
no.

595
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,760
What?
I like,

596
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,440
everything's fucking organic.
You're Bozo,

597
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,850
you know,
like that's the way it's supposed to be.

598
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:02,950
I mean,
when you look at just the,

599
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,850
the obesity,
heart disease,

600
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,680
cancer,
diabetes,

601
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,700
autism,
like how is it through the roof?

602
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,620
How are there 400 pound guys everywhere
25 years ago that didn't happen,

603
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,520
right?
You know,

604
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:20,800
and then they change everything as far
as I'm concerned.

605
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:23,320
There's three reasons why it could have
happened in because I don't know,

606
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,150
I'm not a scientist,
I'm fucking wrestler.

607
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:30,510
But I know when I get people to eat what
God created and stuff that's not

608
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:35,080
genetically modified,
I've found that they get out of pain and

609
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:36,610
that's what we did with Jake and Scott.
You know,

610
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:40,570
Razor Ramon also moved into my house and
then when you get a chance to watch

611
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,510
before you have Jay,
come on,

612
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,700
definitely watch a resurrection.

613
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,890
Jake the snake,
because I can set you up with that too.

614
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,300
Um,
but uh,

615
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,110
jake,
I got them eating real food and Scott

616
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,820
All Aka,
razor Ramon,

617
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,850
eating real food and within two weeks
they're already going to start getting

618
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,200
out of pain.
That's why I'm,

619
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,220
I eat the way I eat because I don't want
to feel like I'm 82.

620
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:07,690
I want to feel like I'm 42 at 62 now.
When you talk about your food plan,

621
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:11,380
like are you giving them specific
portions and what to eat?

622
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,440
Like how do you set it up on the APP?
Which right now are all.

623
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,450
Dude I've got,
I think I have the most extensive app on

624
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:23,770
the planet and it like just go to the
workouts and I'll come back to the

625
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,540
android and iphone everything.
And right now you can get it a lot about

626
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,800
windows phone.
I think it works on that thing.

627
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,330
Whatever it is,
we've set it up for everything that you

628
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:37,150
can use after the IPAD,
your computer.

629
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:41,230
And I didn't realize it at the time that
I set it up for the iphone,

630
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,610
the droid,
the IPAD,

631
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:45,250
the tablet and the computer.
Like going back in time,

632
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:48,520
I would've done the phone because in the
computer,

633
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,190
because you can have your phone go right
to the TV,

634
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,420
right if you've got an apple tv,
but I see it caused me a lot more money

635
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:59,350
to do it with all five units.
The bottom line is I created this thing

636
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,890
like from Arthur stuff,
I call it ddpy rebuilt.

637
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,370
You can't get out of bed.
You can't do the workout.

638
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,790
Bullshit.
I got three workouts in bed that have

639
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:12,970
nothing to do with fucking.
It's just friggin working out for 10

640
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:15,250
minutes.
Twelve minutes will get you up and I

641
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:16,390
called those bed flex.

642
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,180
Then I put you in chair force where
you're sitting in a chair.

643
00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:21,850
I got eight workouts and I'd fucking
chair,

644
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,820
which gets you strong enough to hold the
chair,

645
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,000
so I call those stand strong like Arthur
was doing.

646
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,740
Help you get up,
help you get down,

647
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,320
help you balance healthy,
keep you from falling.

648
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:37,360
Then you're ready for beginner and once
you get the all the modifications that I

649
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:39,250
teach,
you will stand strong.

650
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,650
I got a guy who's 84 years old,
his name is Ted Evans.

651
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:44,750
He's been working with me since he was
68.

652
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,270
The motherfucker can do every workout.
I do.

653
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,570
Every workout now is modified times.
Yes,

654
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:55,340
but he can do every fucking workout I do
and it goes all the way to extreme

655
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:58,070
psycho shit.
Like I did a workout today where I took

656
00:32:58,071 --> 00:33:01,340
my foot and held out in front of me and
held it for 30 seconds.

657
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,100
Then pulled it out,
held it for 30 seconds.

658
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:06,680
This is all core stuff.
It's got to be to stuff.

659
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,920
God skips my mind right now,
the fighter of the UFC fighter.

660
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,430
I'm the French who was amazing.
Yes.

661
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,290
I mean,
nobody can ever take him down.

662
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,190
Yo.
They hook his leg and boom.

663
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,780
You're not taking him down.
He's going to hop around because his

664
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:26,180
core strength.
You had to be doing some of this type of

665
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:27,590
stuff.
A lot of gymnastics.

666
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,371
Well,
again,

667
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:32,120
those guys are super freaked.
Any as wrestlers or UFC guys,

668
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:34,730
I been there.
That's a whole different level.

669
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:36,040
And George Superior,
I will remember.

670
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,730
Why couldn't they?
Nobody's taking him down.

671
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,900
I don't care how they hook his leg,
so he really gets all of that inner

672
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:46,550
strength and that's really what I'm
doing at a level that you can start in

673
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:47,570
bed,
right?

674
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,110
So there's no more fucking excuse,
almost fucking excuses and that's so

675
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,560
important is because people can feel
sorry for themselves.

676
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,950
They can say they can't do it.
They don't have the energy there to beat

677
00:33:57,951 --> 00:33:59,150
up.
That's bullshit.

678
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:02,060
There's always something you can do
that's always something if you.

679
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:04,250
But if you give yourself that fucking
excuse,

680
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,340
that's the problem.
What what I love about that video is if

681
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,440
anybody had an excuse,
it's that guy.

682
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,700
Absolutely.
That guy,

683
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,640
I mean two canes,
giant belly blown out,

684
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:16,790
knees blown out,
back veteran,

685
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,440
hire a trooper,
guide,

686
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,930
guide me jumping out of airplanes over
and over again.

687
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:24,650
Blows his body apart and you fixed it
and he fixed it.

688
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,380
He picks.
I just literally like so my credit.

689
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,700
So when I send them the food plant right
from,

690
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,140
from,
from Fred Bushy,

691
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,680
his food plan because it just regular
food.

692
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:38,240
But like,
what do you have the meeting like

693
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,750
chicken,
let's,

694
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,630
let's,
let's say there's so alleged people's,

695
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,740
you'll hear me say in my program over
and over and over and over and over

696
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:46,310
again.

697
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:50,540
Make the DDP why your own bike.
And I explained to Arthur when I called

698
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:51,680
him.
Well here's what happened.

699
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:53,120
So he,
um,

700
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,520
[inaudible],
I sent him the food plan.

701
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:57,830
Let me say it again.
If he writes me back,

702
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,560
I think I can do it.
I'll give it a try.

703
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,783
You go crazy.
No,

704
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,600
I go,
hey,

705
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,710
awesome.
Keep me posted.

706
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,920
But he said four words or he wrote for
words.

707
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,630
I can do this.
I said,

708
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:11,570
give me your number right now.
And I call it the motherfucker up.

709
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,520
If you say you can use,
say you can't,

710
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:16,000
you're right.
You know that you say you can or you

711
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,053
can't.
You're right.

712
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,300
She said that originally who Henry Ford
is,

713
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:20,900
right?
Yeah.

714
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,340
And I always say,
what the fuck did he ever do know what

715
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:29,180
the fuck did he ever do?
But for when he said I can do it,

716
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:29,990
I said,
give me your number.

717
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,060
So I called them and I said,
yeah,

718
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:36,530
we talked for about an hour.
Two weeks later he calls me back.

719
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,250
The main thing talked to him in,
in,

720
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,300
in that conversation,
which is again what positively

721
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,630
unstoppable is all about.
As important as the workout is,

722
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,220
as important as the eating plan is the
10 percent of the equation,

723
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,400
the 90 percent is right between your
ears right here,

724
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,490
that six inch piece of real estate,
the story you tell yourself,

725
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,060
and I said,
if you can really just get past that

726
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:04,260
story and start
telling yourself a different story.

727
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,650
An example would be when I had,
when I went up from my hall of Fame

728
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:12,450
Induction Speech in front of 20,000
people in millions of people on USA and

729
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:15,030
on the wwe network,
which is only nine 99,

730
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:19,020
by the way,
it's like a rib bottom line is,

731
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:23,640
is that I wasn't in the back going,
Oh God,

732
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:24,870
I hope I don't fuck this up.

733
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,520
Oh God.
What if I forget was going to say,

734
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,900
Oh God,
this sucks,

735
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:29,430
but what if I.
What if I fuck up?

736
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,960
I wouldn't say.
Now I'm saying this can be the best

737
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:32,970
thing I've ever done.
I'm going to blow people away and make

738
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:33,930
them laugh.
Make them cry.

739
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:36,630
I'm going to inspire them,
and that was my inner voice.

740
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:38,580
I went out there to the best thing I've
ever done,

741
00:36:38,581 --> 00:36:43,581
like it's the best thing I've ever done,
but it's about that story that you tell

742
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:48,510
yourself when you get all this shit and
that's why people listen to you because

743
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,500
they need to be reminded it over and
over and over again.

744
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,870
You know,
the way you think about things is so

745
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,520
important.
It's so important.

746
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:58,410
It's almost more important than the
facts,

747
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,340
right?
The Way and the way this guy decided

748
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:05,740
that he was going to change his life,
that that video is so important to

749
00:37:05,741 --> 00:37:06,000
people.

750
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,840
I mean,
if there's ever.

751
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,840
That's the best testimonial video you're
ever going to say ever.

752
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:11,640
I mean,
that guy is as broken as they get.

753
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,880
I mean he's basically,
I easily could have been in a wheelchair

754
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,210
easily or like was it announced a time
he was going around,

755
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:19,044
you know,
like any kind of,

756
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,640
you know,
go to the unit of the airport,

757
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,880
where do they put you in which in a
wheelchair because it's too hard for too

758
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:25,650
hard for him to walk around.
And again,

759
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,180
going back to eating.
So back to the law,

760
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,260
what do you get them,
you know?

761
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,810
Well again,
I use,

762
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:34,140
I get a make the GDP wider owner.
You can do Paleo if you want to do

763
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:36,520
Paleo,
you can do this Keto Diet,

764
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:40,140
whatever you're doing with that.
I tried to say if you're early on in

765
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:41,780
your young,
you know,

766
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,430
I encourage them to do calorie counting,
calories in,

767
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:47,610
calories out,
but a lot of people that doesn't work

768
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:48,480
for anymore.

769
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,360
So what I get them to do is go gluten
and dairy free.

770
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,650
And really I started with gluten free.
If you can go and people go gluten free,

771
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,440
I said,
all's I know is the people I work with

772
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,380
get out of pain.
I'm one of them.

773
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,600
So I don't give a fuck if you eat gluten
or not.

774
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:05,700
I don't care about the gluten fucking
Nazis.

775
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,620
I'm fucking like,
hey dude,

776
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:10,650
what the fuck you want to do?
But this is what I do.

777
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,890
This is what him and her and him and her
do and look at them and it just helps

778
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,600
drop weight.
It's about inflammation in your body.

779
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:25,620
Go back to icing your body sugar,
which were all at explored.

780
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,130
I try to get him to cut down as much as
they can.

781
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:31,230
Some people quit completely,
which blows my mind,

782
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,650
which tells me they really have that
substance by my friend Stacy Morris who

783
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:38,170
lost a 180 pounds in 18 months.

784
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,530
She's actually on the cover of women's
Day right now,

785
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,650
that big magazine for women's Day of her
transformation.

786
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,680
She wrote a book on it,
like something comfort,

787
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:49,660
fuel it,
eating comfort or family comfort.

788
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,790
You can catch it up on my site.
It's up there,

789
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:57,040
but she wrote this book about eating
without sugar and that's like,

790
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,190
I'm not telling anybody do that because
I can't do that up.

791
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:04,030
Your right.
I want us to delete the sugar I just

792
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:05,260
don't use,
but you're not,

793
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:08,940
you're just not being a glutton.
And I'm eating good sugars like the

794
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,700
honey that I'm putting in this gimmick
is organic honey.

795
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,260
So,
um,

796
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,670
the,
um,

797
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,740
the food part for pretty inflammation
would be the sugar,

798
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:26,490
dairy and wheat and gluten.
Get those out of your body.

799
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,370
I challenge you.
You.

800
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,940
Have you ever gone to gluten free?
No,

801
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,840
I have.
And how much better did you feel?

802
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,800
Feel really good.
Look,

803
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:35,140
I,
I'm basically gluten free all the time

804
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:37,420
except for I take cheat days.
Oh sure.

805
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,280
I'll take a cheat day and I'll have a
bowl pasta.

806
00:39:39,281 --> 00:39:43,190
But for the most part I rarely eat bread
and I rarely read anything.

807
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:48,550
Pasta or anything with wheat will let me
give you this two and a half weeks.

808
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,610
Let me give you an alternative.
I love Pasta

809
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,430
and the Irish,
German,

810
00:39:54,431 --> 00:39:58,010
Dutch kid,
but all my best friends were Genta

811
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:58,843
Pharaoh.
So

812
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,890
Rossi,
I read all my buddies will go mas,

813
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,900
you know.
And so I love Italian food.

814
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:07,600
I fucking love it.
So there's a,

815
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,270
there's a company called Tink,
Yada.

816
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,420
That's the best pasta I've ever had in
some brown rice pasta,

817
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,870
so there's always a substitute when you
get that out of your body in two and a

818
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:20,170
half,
three weeks,

819
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,900
it's a different level job like you've
already feel better,

820
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:25,570
you feel better,
but it's got to get out of your body and

821
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,060
then if you put it back in,
you know,

822
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,130
here and there you're going to run late,
but it's going to go away quick because

823
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:31,960
it doesn't have all that shit stored in
your body.

824
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,180
You know,
it also reminds me how shitty I feel

825
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:39,181
after I eat it when I do eat a pizza
laid on the couch,

826
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,470
like a,
like a lead weights in my stomach.

827
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,020
But what I substituted with his
spaghetti squash,

828
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,750
I lost.
That is an awesome choice.

829
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,240
Getty squash with some garlic and
Marinara sauce.

830
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:51,340
It's fantastic and that's one of the
guilt free.

831
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,240
That's one of our recipes,
like the way our,

832
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,200
our APP is set up or DDP Yoga now app
and like I said,

833
00:40:56,201 --> 00:40:58,350
anybody wants to try it?
Fuck it costs you nothing.

834
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,000
Go try it for seven days.
You like it,

835
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:02,140
like it not get out of it?
I don't give a fuck.

836
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,320
I mean I don't.
I mean I only want people want to put

837
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:07,000
the work in.
Some people will say to me,

838
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,560
well,
how much do I have to do it?

839
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,720
I say,
you don't,

840
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,580
you don't have to fucking do it.

841
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:17,620
I don't want you to do it.
I want you to own it and really do it or

842
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:20,320
not and I'll try to inspire you because
every,

843
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,810
every Monday I've got motivational
Mondays on the APP.

844
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,880
Every Monday I'm doing another story
about something I saw and I'm bringing

845
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:29,380
it to you.
It could be three minutes,

846
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:32,230
it could be eight minutes,
but it's going to zip video on the APP.

847
00:41:32,231 --> 00:41:34,070
Is that it's,
it's one.

848
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,650
There's 150 of them up there because
I've been doing it for two and a half

849
00:41:36,651 --> 00:41:41,450
years and then there's every week we
have a new recipe come out and I'm not

850
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:44,360
just gonna tell you what's in it and how
to make it.

851
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:47,840
I'm going to fucking show you how to
make it because we got in our DDP Yoga

852
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,520
performance center,
which is in Smyrna,

853
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:51,350
Georgia,
which by the way,

854
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:54,380
every first time you come in there,
it's free.

855
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,130
Name me another fucking gym or something
like that that does that.

856
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:01,640
How far is that from Dallas or Atlanta?
Atlanta rather.

857
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,250
Well,
it's literally 20 minutes.

858
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,600
Twenty minutes from the heart of
Atlanta.

859
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:09,320
I mean Atlanta when I'm doing a Gig,
I'm going to stop it.

860
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,720
Dude.
State you're going to stay.

861
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:15,290
I have.
I just bought a crib that literally one

862
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:18,440
of my buddies,
titus who's from the wwe is coming in on

863
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:22,130
Tuesday to train with me.
I got a hyperbaric chamber now.

864
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,210
Whoa.
Yes.

865
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,240
12 Psi.
I got a cryo system in my house.

866
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,910
I would about float tanks.
I don't have that.

867
00:42:31,911 --> 00:42:34,430
You ever fuck with one?
You know I haven't because I'm Kinda

868
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,520
gonna be some right here,
buddy.

869
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,000
I'm really.
I'm kind of scared of that because it's

870
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,720
been about is
how will you scared you?

871
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,420
Other people you're screaming against?
No,

872
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:49,000
I do,
but I'm being honest bro.

873
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,010
When I first got into one,
can I get you in one today?

874
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,540
You know what?
Yes,

875
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,580
that's right.
You got to get.

876
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,620
You don't want to have one in your
house.

877
00:42:57,621 --> 00:43:00,050
I guarantee you.
Most relaxing thing ever.

878
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,010
Okay.
What would you get?

879
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,410
I can easily get out of there.
I just pushed the door open.

880
00:43:03,411 --> 00:43:04,110
Okay,
cool.

881
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,820
So you know,
only because it's you because you

882
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,900
inspired.
You inspire the fuck out of me.

883
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,510
Like I was.
This was so crazy.

884
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,650
I mutual.
Thank you.

885
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,670
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

886
00:43:13,671 --> 00:43:14,420
You know,
I uh,

887
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,370
I knew we were going to get long lake
incredibly.

888
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,080
But,
but here's what happened.

889
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:18,770
I,
I,

890
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,260
I've been reaching out to different
people like Eddie Bravo.

891
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,450
He's like,
he's a buddy of mine and I just got a

892
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:25,710
disc replaced.
He really had a lower back.

893
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,900
His disc was so bad he could barely get
out of bed and he had a titanium

894
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,730
articulating disk put in his back.

895
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,170
He feels way better now.
Yeah.

896
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,760
And he gained an inch five nine now,
which,

897
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,460
which is pretty sweet because of all the
technology that they had.

898
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,080
It's really incredible.
That can help this,

899
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:44,210
this were all smashed from Jujitsu,
especially lower back though.

900
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,240
I've always said like Eddie Bravo,
like he did what they did.

901
00:43:49,391 --> 00:43:52,380
Your Jitsu community would have done in
the uh,

902
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,840
in the yoga community.
Just take a totally different path,

903
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:57,470
right?
Like,

904
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:01,280
I don't want to be in the yoga world.
I'm going to be way the fuck over there.

905
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,770
I want to be the different guy then.
But we were just talking about where we

906
00:44:04,771 --> 00:44:07,100
were talking right before that.
So no,

907
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,460
nothing that I,
I,

908
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,280
I reached out to a bunch of different
guys.

909
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:11,600
I like,
I've heard you talk about,

910
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,390
you know,
dvp why and what we're doing and you've

911
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:16,180
talked about a lot of cool stuff,
you know,

912
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:19,840
and you've segwayed me into a couple of
like I got to get on his show and I

913
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:20,683
think we'll get amazing.

914
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:25,600
We'll get along amazingly.
And then I saw on youtube it was a um,

915
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:30,140
somebody put together like a bunch of
your clips from the show and I'm

916
00:44:30,141 --> 00:44:30,900
listening to it.
I'm like,

917
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,270
man,
this motherfucker sounded just like me.

918
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:34,740
I mean,
I got to get on his show and I

919
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,270
literally,
when I finished watching it,

920
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,770
I literally looked up,
I went,

921
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:39,640
God,
I'm thrown us out in the universe.

922
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,810
I want to get on Rogan show within the
next year,

923
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,490
two days later,
you dme,

924
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,660
two days later you dm me today,
Brian into Dmu forever.

925
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,220
It's one of those things where it's just
unfortunately or fortunately,

926
00:44:56,221 --> 00:44:59,340
there's just so many different requests
for people to come on the podcast.

927
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,690
I can't keep up.
No,

928
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:01,830
I get it.
It's just I can't.

929
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,140
It's impossible for.
Have you been in the back of my head for

930
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:07,140
a long time and I think that yoga,
like I said,

931
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:11,520
it's so important and I think what
you've done is make it accessible to

932
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:13,050
people that wouldn't have considered it
before.

933
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,310
All right.
You got to do me and favor.

934
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,410
Okay.
What I got to do when you're talking

935
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:20,460
about what the fuck I do.
Ddpy.

936
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:23,190
Ddpy Yoga?
Yes.

937
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:24,720
Because it's different,
you know,

938
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,170
mainly because people put it in a box
and you get it.

939
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,180
Will you?
Will you do a workout with me?

940
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,080
Yes.
I would love to.

941
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,390
A robbery did it,
my partner and on it.

942
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,150
Yes.
He loved it.

943
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:37,020
He loved it.
He said,

944
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:37,950
dude,
it's bad ass.

945
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:39,540
He said he's definitely doing something
different.

946
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,520
His his take was,
he's like,

947
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:43,170
he's got,
he's doing yoga.

948
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:45,180
He goes,
but he's got a whole nother edge to it

949
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:48,900
and I keep again,
making it my own and I encourage

950
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:50,520
everybody.
What's really cool about.

951
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:55,380
I've got some workouts that have me in
like two people or four people behind me

952
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:59,460
and they're like the introductory.
There's always someone modifying.

953
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,210
Like when I first started doing yoga,
no one modified shit.

954
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,270
They never told you.
So I had to figure this shit out.

955
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,440
So anything I did,
I gave you a more.

956
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,210
How do you make this easier step in
lower do we need,

957
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,540
don't blow yourself out.
Now the thing that you don't know,

958
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,860
and I gave you one of Mark DDP Yoga mats
with the bag inside,

959
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:24,861
it is a bluetooth heart monitor and what
that's going to do is connect right to

960
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:29,250
the APP.
So are you an iphone guy or droid?

961
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,410
I have iphone,
but I'm gonna switch over either

962
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:32,430
bullshit.
Oh,

963
00:46:32,431 --> 00:46:34,470
I get that too,
but I'm sort of like a,

964
00:46:34,471 --> 00:46:36,870
um,
an attic of not wanting to learn again,

965
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,780
but you know,
they got that mirror and things so it

966
00:46:38,781 --> 00:46:41,730
pops right up on your TV,
up there will come where your heart

967
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:43,110
rate's at.
Oh Wow.

968
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:47,700
And then it tracks you at the end of it.
How long have you not been in your zone?

969
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:50,580
How long have you been in your zone and
how long have you been over years old?

970
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,010
Think about this.
Who did this APP for you?

971
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,540
Myself,
Steve,

972
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:56,040
you,
who's the president of our company.

973
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:00,940
And we hired these guys out of Turkey
because they were all went,

974
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:06,320
they all went to Georgia tech and it's
way cheaper,

975
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:07,820
but it's,
you know,

976
00:47:07,821 --> 00:47:10,530
it's been a long.
I got probably coming up on $3,000,000

977
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:13,690
in it.
Jesus crowd to it's lasted.

978
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,210
It's extensive,
you know,

979
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,970
and again,
there's a lot of interaction with it,

980
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,290
you know.
So,

981
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,990
um,
the actual,

982
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,730
uh,
we make it like a video game at the end.

983
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,240
So when it gets to the end,
you'll

984
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:33,300
get to the end of brothers exactly what
I wanted to hit the next level.

985
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,800
So when you're putting all this stuff
together,

986
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:39,640
like this has got to be a long process
of refining and getting it just right.

987
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,830
I mean this must have taken over your
life.

988
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:42,880
Oh,
absolutely.

989
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,220
Absolutely.
But I go on the road all the time.

990
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:47,230
I do comic con.
Do you ever do comicon?

991
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:47,771
No.
No.

992
00:47:47,771 --> 00:47:50,230
I've never done.
I want to do you have to.

993
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:55,231
You will fucking have a line for ever.
I used to be a comic book Dork,

994
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,950
man.
I had to sell them on when I was poor.

995
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,530
I used to.
I had all these comic books that I

996
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:02,830
collected from the time I was a little
kid and then when I became a standup

997
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:05,200
comedian and I was starving in the early
days,

998
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:08,830
I sold all my comic books and just,
it's just a bummer man.

999
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:10,520
I'm scared to go look at comic books
again.

1000
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,111
Don't,
don't,

1001
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:12,400
don't do that because it'll disappear.

1002
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,600
Do you know Adi Shankar is?
No.

1003
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,410
Did you see,
um,

1004
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:23,580
there was a power ranger bootleg video
that came out like maybe four years ago,

1005
00:48:25,661 --> 00:48:29,440
five years ago,
it was five years ago and it blew up on

1006
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:31,210
Youtube.
Got like 5 million views,

1007
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:34,520
which you know,
back then that was fucking huge because.

1008
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,030
So I'm the guy who owns,
owns a power,

1009
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,620
just put a lawsuit on it and youtube and
they had to pull it off.

1010
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:45,910
Next thing you know,
he's on CNN and they're asking her about

1011
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:46,990
it and he's like,
fuck him.

1012
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,940
He goes,
he doesn't mean we're not trying to make

1013
00:48:48,941 --> 00:48:50,410
money.
We're not monetizing this.

1014
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:51,244
And next,
you know,

1015
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,360
he pulled the thing off your suit off
and now it's like $22 million and this

1016
00:48:55,361 --> 00:48:58,360
is something that he did because he
produced a bunch of movies,

1017
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,390
but they kept changing and shit,
like wouldn't let him do what he wants

1018
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:03,263
to do.

1019
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:08,050
And like freshman was judge dredd in
five years ago or a little before that.

1020
00:49:08,051 --> 00:49:10,060
He's telling me how he's going to do
this shit on Youtube,

1021
00:49:10,061 --> 00:49:11,290
but I'm like,
what the fuck do you mean you're going

1022
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:14,740
to put shorts on youtube when he did
that one?

1023
00:49:14,741 --> 00:49:19,741
It's got 22 million views right now.
And that really became like this

1024
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,370
underground,
you know,

1025
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,810
Yoda type person of the Internet.
And uh,

1026
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:29,200
he sent me a script about three years
ago when we started.

1027
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:34,330
It's called Gods and it's kind of like,
you know,

1028
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:36,180
every,
all superheroes,

1029
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:38,830
as you know,
they're all slightly different but the

1030
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:40,510
same.
And uh,

1031
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,720
it's a very dark,
dark superhero series that will,

1032
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:49,960
when you get to the fighting part of,
or remind you of like,

1033
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,390
Fart,
you know,

1034
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,620
from the Nih,
from the eighties frigging video to

1035
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:58,650
combat shit like that meets a really
dark story that uh,

1036
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,500
it's going to be a netflix original.

1037
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:03,070
So.
Oh,

1038
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,170
that's something.
Something to why,

1039
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:05,980
what only call I think you'll,
I think you'll dig it.

1040
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:09,100
I love the watchman.
It's kind of a little bit like that,

1041
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:10,360
but not.
I was open to it.

1042
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:13,130
We're going to do a sequel.
And I had heard that they weren't they

1043
00:50:13,131 --> 00:50:14,290
planning on that,
Jamie,

1044
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:16,210
is that,
that's something they're working on.

1045
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,740
It was so good.
I was like,

1046
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:19,570
how are they,
how did they not follow up on this?

1047
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:20,810
I don't know.
You know,

1048
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:22,120
but we're going to.
We have,

1049
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,040
like I say,
it's in the process right now,

1050
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:26,050
putting together.
He's the brains behind it,

1051
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,860
but it's something.
I'm speeding.

1052
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:27,980
You

1053
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,390
were into comics systems stuff be on hbo
go.

1054
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,840
Oh Shit,
right.

1055
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,260
I heard that.
Uh Oh.

1056
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,600
But different people,
Huh?

1057
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,400
Oh,
interesting.

1058
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,550
All right,
well I'm down for that.

1059
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:44,443
Yeah,
I'll check it out.

1060
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:45,320
Mitch.
Be Oh man.

1061
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:49,640
They got to pick up the slack.
Netflix coming in strong are like,

1062
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:52,280
fuck man.
Gather up the troops.

1063
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,040
Was a war going on?
Fucking ozarks back,

1064
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:57,610
baby.
Woo Woo.

1065
00:50:57,611 --> 00:51:00,780
On two episodes in a good show.
Did you.

1066
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,190
Did you see the first center center?
Oh No,

1067
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:05,630
I haven't seen that show heard.
That's very good.

1068
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,770
That's just the deal,
dude.

1069
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:13,760
They made her look confusing people.
You're around her.

1070
00:51:13,761 --> 00:51:15,290
You like,
I don't know what my opinions are.

1071
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:18,470
I'm going to change them.
You tell me what your opinions are.

1072
00:51:18,471 --> 00:51:19,490
I'll take those.
She,

1073
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:22,580
she looked,
she comes off as really like girl mc

1074
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:24,140
storage,
but that,

1075
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:28,500
that frigging show right there.
My wife and Brenda and my,

1076
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,950
my daughter Lexie,
she was there.

1077
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,240
We watched all eight episodes.
Sam by one after another on a Sunday

1078
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:37,380
afternoon.
We were like pulled in sheet.

1079
00:51:37,381 --> 00:51:41,390
My wife had seen a printed scene.
They were playing it on the plane and

1080
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:42,670
she,
when she came back she was like,

1081
00:51:42,671 --> 00:51:44,360
we have.
I couldn't finish watching it.

1082
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,250
You've got to get this.
I'll watch it from the beginning.

1083
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:47,150
Getting snack.
Good.

1084
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:51,680
It's fam shows now.
It's a really interesting time to be a

1085
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:52,670
consumer.
Oh,

1086
00:51:52,671 --> 00:51:53,810
absolutely,
man.

1087
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,870
Yeah.
I'm big on the Netflix and a sneaky

1088
00:51:56,871 --> 00:51:57,290
pete.

1089
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,770
Did you ever see any of that?
Got Hurt.

1090
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:00,410
That's great.
That's an Amazon,

1091
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:01,610
right?
Amazon.

1092
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:04,340
Yeah.
Everyone's just that Goliath is supposed

1093
00:52:04,341 --> 00:52:06,860
to be fantastic on Amazon too.
That's that Billy Bob Thornton,

1094
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,350
who I loved the first season.
I,

1095
00:52:08,351 --> 00:52:09,980
I haven't got through the second one
yet,

1096
00:52:09,981 --> 00:52:11,510
but uh,
it's a crazy time.

1097
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:12,890
Have you thought about doing something
like that?

1098
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,800
Like maybe on a Netflix or something
along those lines,

1099
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:20,801
like having like a sort of like
inspirational clips mixed in with your

1100
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,470
workouts,
with these people showing

1101
00:52:24,471 --> 00:52:26,040
transformations.
Um,

1102
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:27,650
you know,
a good friend of mine,

1103
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,450
great idea.
Do you know tim?

1104
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:31,310
Tim?
Say as I know the name.

1105
00:52:31,311 --> 00:52:32,990
Yeah,
he was Howard Stern's.

1106
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:33,973
Yeah,
that's fine.

1107
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,920
That's name.
And he just came up to me.

1108
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:40,730
He was at that show I was telling you
about all when this weekend and he was

1109
00:52:40,731 --> 00:52:41,564
like,
dude,

1110
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:45,350
twitches the future.
You got to do something with this.

1111
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:48,020
And I know I've heard it twitch,
but it was like video game,

1112
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,790
you know,
people watch a video game stuff.

1113
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:50,541
He said,
yeah,

1114
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:55,541
but it's going to go to a whole new
level and sapiens a really smart guy and

1115
00:52:55,701 --> 00:52:58,460
I'm actually helping him get back on
track with his health.

1116
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,260
So he's going to come to Atlanta and see
me.

1117
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,480
He's going to talk to me and Steve and
figure out what we do.

1118
00:53:02,481 --> 00:53:02,900
I can,
I,

1119
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,110
I'm all over.
This company would never be successful

1120
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:10,340
without the Internet,
without people sharing that Arthur video

1121
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:11,440
everywhere,
you know?

1122
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:13,970
And there's so many other videos that
we've had go viral.

1123
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,210
One of my favorites,
and I'll,

1124
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,040
I'll get this to you.
My buddy named Mark Morrow,

1125
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,600
he's a former wrestler,
marvelous Marc Mero back when we rustled

1126
00:53:22,601 --> 00:53:26,620
gabby was johnny be bad.
And he changed his name from John into

1127
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:27,080
mark [inaudible].

1128
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,980
His real name was mark two hydro
projects.

1129
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:34,410
Real bad was bad.
He actually was actually actually Mark

1130
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:39,410
Morrow is a four time New York Empire
State Games boxing champion.

1131
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,000
Yeah.
From back in the day when he was a kid.

1132
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:43,740
But uh,
he,

1133
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,900
he's become this inspirational speaker.
Two kids.

1134
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:48,480
I've never seen anybody move kids the
way he does.

1135
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,510
So he was in Atlanta one day and I set
my crew on it because I got a whole

1136
00:53:51,511 --> 00:53:53,850
production studio like resurrection.
We filmed that,

1137
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:55,350
we edit it,
we did everything.

1138
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,320
And um,
I sent my crew down there to just go

1139
00:53:58,321 --> 00:54:01,500
down and film them.
And Steve took this one part where he

1140
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:04,280
talks about his mom now.
No bullshit.

1141
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:08,250
Go.
I can show you how this one four minute

1142
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:13,251
clip that Steve produced has over a half
a billion views on facebook.

1143
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:19,190
Like half a billion and now mark went
from having trouble getting booked at

1144
00:54:19,191 --> 00:54:21,860
high schools to being in such demand
that he had his.

1145
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:26,860
He had 3000 requests the month that that
video went crazy and people keep taking

1146
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:28,350
it and putting it out there,
but he,

1147
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:31,290
he connects with kids.
It starts out with,

1148
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:33,510
I want to be rich,
I want to be famous.

1149
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,950
And then he showed you,
as you know,

1150
00:54:35,951 --> 00:54:39,390
what can come with that if you're not
mentally prepared to handle that.

1151
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,390
And I don't know how any fucking kid can
be 18,

1152
00:54:42,391 --> 00:54:43,680
19,
20 years old.

1153
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:44,880
I don't think they can.
Yeah.

1154
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:47,040
We'll never seen anybody succeed.
Lebron,

1155
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,770
you know?
Yeah.

1156
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,540
He.
But you know what?

1157
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:54,090
I think one of the reasons why a guy
like him has succeeded because his

1158
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:56,700
success comes along with athletic
performance,

1159
00:54:56,701 --> 00:55:00,000
right?
Like it's not just like being Justin

1160
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,970
bieber being some sort of a musical
superstar.

1161
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:07,800
I think the struggle of the athletic
pursuit is one of the things that keeps

1162
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:12,750
you humble because there's no way to get
around the work and the work keeps you

1163
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:13,240
humble.

1164
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,150
There's no,
I mean to kind of work that you have to

1165
00:55:15,151 --> 00:55:17,970
put in to be Lebron James.
I don't care how genetically gifted he

1166
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:20,580
is.
Clearly he's a fucking freak athlete.

1167
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,520
Ridiculous.
But he's also.

1168
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:26,490
But he's also got a powerful mind when
you hear that guy talk.

1169
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,740
There was some sort of a round table
thing he was doing.

1170
00:55:28,741 --> 00:55:31,260
I don't know if you saw this with John
Stewart and a few other people.

1171
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:34,400
Is that his show?
When that guy talks?

1172
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,480
What is it called?
What is it?

1173
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,180
The barbershop.
Oh Gosh,

1174
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:39,090
I love the prom.
When he talks,

1175
00:55:39,091 --> 00:55:40,200
you go,
okay,

1176
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,170
there's a fucking nuclear furnace burden
inside that guy.

1177
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,490
That's why he's so successful.
It's not just him being a freak athlete.

1178
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:51,360
It's the mind his mind,
but that hard work and that dedication

1179
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:56,361
and his mind is the reason why he's
still so good and keeps it together at,

1180
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:58,140
you know,
what is he 35 now?

1181
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,060
Thirty three,
33.

1182
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,610
It's been around forever.
Been around for a long time,

1183
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,370
but been super fucking successful for a
long time.

1184
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:06,600
Ridiculous.
Never fucked up.

1185
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:09,480
Never drove his car into a tree.
Never punched a cop,

1186
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,550
never got crazy.
I mean he's,

1187
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:16,100
he's kept it together in a rare way that
very few superstars do because it's a,

1188
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:16,861
you know,
it,

1189
00:56:16,861 --> 00:56:17,550
I mean,
you,

1190
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:21,540
I'm sure you went from when you first
started into pro wrestling to becoming

1191
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:24,220
super famous.
It's an an intoxicating

1192
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,420
drug.
Absolutely.

1193
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:28,600
And it's a confusing drug.
It confuses the shit out of a lot of

1194
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:29,830
people.
Fortunately for you,

1195
00:56:29,831 --> 00:56:31,070
you are already a man.
Right?

1196
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,270
And that was the big difference.
I was just say starting at 35 was the

1197
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:38,170
worst thing physically because bill one
of my matches or any of these kids that

1198
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:41,370
it's like four or five car accidents.
One match.

1199
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:42,530
Yeah.
Every,

1200
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,990
every night.
And I said is,

1201
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,110
you know,
as hard as it was starting at 35,

1202
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:52,111
the really positive side was as 35.
So I was much smarter and discipline,

1203
00:56:52,851 --> 00:56:55,000
more mature way more.
And you know,

1204
00:56:55,001 --> 00:56:56,860
that I was telling you about when you
come to Atlanta,

1205
00:56:56,861 --> 00:56:58,800
you're going to stay at my place because
my,

1206
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:01,660
my wife is amazing.
We have the best bed and breakfast and

1207
00:57:01,661 --> 00:57:05,200
there's like five rooms that are all
king size beds because again,

1208
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:08,110
I'm getting ready to work with top
athletes.

1209
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,840
You look at Lebron,
you look at Brady,

1210
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:15,040
how do they perform such a,
especially brady at being 40 years old

1211
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,390
now.
Pretty amazing.

1212
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,130
It's,
but it's the way he eats,

1213
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:21,430
which is pretty much the way I eat.
Isn't he a Vegan though?

1214
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,020
Um,
he's really.

1215
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:24,970
He doesn't lagoon.
It's very strict.

1216
00:57:24,971 --> 00:57:26,320
Again,
way I eat.

1217
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:30,310
I still want the beef I still want,
but I don't eat it all the time now

1218
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,780
where I used to eat that shit all the
time.

1219
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,300
I used to eat 12 eggs in the morning,
now I eat eight,

1220
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,820
know five yolks,
three whites,

1221
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,610
but against keeping the protein.
But,

1222
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:42,040
but he's eating for health,
let's just call it that.

1223
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:47,490
And he's not beating up his body outside
of what he's doing.

1224
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:49,600
When he gets hit,
he beats up his body.

1225
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:52,090
But before that all he's doing is
strengthening his body.

1226
00:57:52,091 --> 00:57:54,910
And that's what DDP wise,
it's strengthening you.

1227
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:57,790
Like I just was reading something.
I love that,

1228
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:01,750
that girly didn't.
Todd didn't play in any preseason stuff

1229
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:03,100
this year.
You don't need that.

1230
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,590
You're going to be out there.
He's going to be in the best shape,

1231
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:08,200
but it's not going to have put his body
already through abuse,

1232
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,800
you know,
so it's just like wherever you can,

1233
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,530
everything that you do with your Jitsu,
mma,

1234
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,880
UFC,
nfl,

1235
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:21,360
getting to the show is the thing.
And when you get to the show,

1236
00:58:21,641 --> 00:58:24,880
you have two jobs.
One be the best player.

1237
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:28,330
You can be the best performer too.
Don't get hurt.

1238
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:32,260
You know what's crazy about Tom Brady?
He looks like someone's Dad.

1239
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:35,380
Like you see them on the bed.
You don't look like,

1240
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:37,900
you know,
you see Herschel Walker without a shirt

1241
00:58:37,901 --> 00:58:39,730
off you go,
Jesus fucking Christ.

1242
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:41,020
What lab was that guy?

1243
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,410
You see Tom Brady like,
oh,

1244
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:48,850
there's Mike's dad.
He's totally normal.

1245
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:49,720
Look it.
I mean,

1246
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:52,090
he doesn't look bad.
He looks like he's in good shape.

1247
00:58:52,091 --> 00:58:53,140
There he is.
Look at that,

1248
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:56,980
but what the fuck?
What the fuck?

1249
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:01,060
How's that possible?
The greatest quarterback of all time.

1250
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,550
That's Mike's dad.
Work Ethic,

1251
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:07,000
but it's his obviously his mind too.
I mean,

1252
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:10,030
that's fucking insane and that guy ain't
sucking in his gut for anybody.

1253
00:59:10,031 --> 00:59:12,130
You could suck his dick.
How about that?

1254
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:15,160
That's not sucking in his back.
He lets that thing hanging out.

1255
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:18,940
I mean it's,
it's a couple of inches over his fucking

1256
00:59:18,941 --> 00:59:22,220
shorts.
Who let him let him relax.

1257
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:27,500
Get that gorgeous wife with him.
He's covering her.

1258
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,720
Jessica Biel together.
Created some sort of a nuclear

1259
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,590
explosion.
Too Hot.

1260
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,290
Yeah.
It's crazy,

1261
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:37,430
but it's crazy.
It's about healing your body and

1262
00:59:37,431 --> 00:59:40,850
especially when you're in that spot and
that's what I can do for these guys and

1263
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:42,200
you'll see as we,
as we work out,

1264
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:45,110
you'll get it and you know,
is everything.

1265
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,270
I want to go back to your back.
See,

1266
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:50,720
this is what I don't understand.
When the conventional wisdom is,

1267
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:52,990
when it's bone on bone,
like you're fucked,

1268
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,750
there's too much inflammation,
there is too much grinding and you're

1269
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,470
just going to be too painful to do
anything and you're gonna have to do

1270
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,230
some sort of a surgery.
How?

1271
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,710
How does the Yogis does it?
Because the muscle strength in the DDP.

1272
01:00:06,711 --> 01:00:07,910
Why are we can.
Sorry.

1273
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,750
How does the DDP wise do that?
Does it?

1274
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:15,770
Just the strengthening all the core
muscles around your spine stabilizes

1275
01:00:15,771 --> 01:00:19,200
everything and keep moving.
The only thing I can remember,

1276
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,750
Joe,
I'm a wrestler.

1277
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,830
I'm not a nightclub nightclub owner,
friggin.

1278
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,670
I've been working in the bar business my
whole life.

1279
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:27,640
That's what I did before this.
Um,

1280
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,880
but I,
for some reason I'm just gifted with

1281
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:34,190
figuring shit out.
Like on my app,

1282
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,330
there's a guy named Jerry Cameron
disable that in wheelchair for two and a

1283
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:43,310
half years.
There's no way to lose six to 40 looks

1284
01:00:43,311 --> 01:00:46,280
great,
but he's got the walker that he got

1285
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,170
after two and a half years of being in
the chair,

1286
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,100
got himself out the old.
This is all my app or my in my law,

1287
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,010
we can rebuild you.
I'm doing my own little shell.

1288
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,550
We can rebuild you.
I'd trademark that name and you remember

1289
01:00:58,551 --> 01:01:01,820
what that's from $6,000,000.
We can rebuild you.

1290
01:01:01,821 --> 01:01:03,110
So that's our thing.

1291
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:09,110
So Jerry,
we have him in.

1292
01:01:09,111 --> 01:01:13,010
We over the seven week period now.
He's got a long way to go still,

1293
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:17,150
but you will be so amazed.
Every show that comes up,

1294
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,110
how he gains just a little bit more
little incremental stuff.

1295
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:24,340
Exactly.
Input the confidence and like we,

1296
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,480
we reached out to our community in
Smyrna,

1297
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:30,230
Georgia and we said we're looking for
people that want our help,

1298
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,740
cost him nothing.
If you'll be part of our group and we

1299
01:01:33,741 --> 01:01:35,750
can track you,
you can come,

1300
01:01:35,751 --> 01:01:37,700
go do our stuff,
you know.

1301
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,920
And we gave,
we gave them the APP,

1302
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:43,280
we set them up and out of the 12 or 13
and started,

1303
01:01:43,281 --> 01:01:46,460
we still have like seven and this is
like eight weeks later.

1304
01:01:46,461 --> 01:01:48,500
And to see their stories,
like we follow them,

1305
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,920
every couple of weeks will pop up and
show where they're at and what they're

1306
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:52,550
doing.

1307
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,710
But Jerry,
I got special spot.

1308
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,660
Might just like you do for military
guys.

1309
01:01:56,661 --> 01:01:58,460
You know,
I've been to Iraq three times.

1310
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:00,280
Afghanistan once you've done those
tours.

1311
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,600
Thirteen days.
I haven't done it yet.

1312
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:03,850
No.
Oh you should go.

1313
01:02:03,851 --> 01:02:06,610
They would freak the fuck out over you.
Um,

1314
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:10,280
they would love you.
But I started in 2004 with that shit.

1315
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:13,130
And over that period,
the shrine Williams.

1316
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,230
What was getting shot down a?
No,

1317
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:15,940
no,
no,

1318
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,890
no,
no.

1319
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,620
I just,
I hate.

1320
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,000
No,
I did not add anything.

1321
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,160
What?
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

1322
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:28,200
The bottom line is I have a fond spot
for those guys and I have some things I

1323
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:28,951
do as well.
Yeah,

1324
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:31,710
I know.
And there's something I'm about to do

1325
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,580
off of my app that's going to be life
changing for a lot of those guys.

1326
01:02:35,581 --> 01:02:37,020
I just don't have it all put together
yet,

1327
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:39,270
but it's a,
it's one of the things that I'm working

1328
01:02:39,271 --> 01:02:43,260
on right now because I want to be able
to give back to help them.

1329
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,470
I do stuff with their organizations.
They're real people start.

1330
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:49,150
I'm like,
I just did one with Mod deuce deuce in

1331
01:02:49,151 --> 01:02:50,500
um,
in um,

1332
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:53,760
New Jersey where I'm from.
Like I've lived in point pleasant

1333
01:02:53,761 --> 01:02:56,640
bricktown to the next town over and I
went over there and I did one for the

1334
01:02:56,641 --> 01:03:00,870
guys there and it was,
had like 75 guys there and guys and

1335
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:05,310
their families and uh,
every one of those disabled bedsides

1336
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:06,780
gave them the APP,
you know,

1337
01:03:06,781 --> 01:03:09,840
because I just want you to do it because
if you do it,

1338
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,870
you're going to feel better.
I don't know how much better,

1339
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,540
how much work are you going to put in
and you know,

1340
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:18,300
it all comes down to the work ethic.
Like where you are,

1341
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:20,610
how much work you put in,
where can you get right in.

1342
01:03:20,611 --> 01:03:21,630
We're it,
I,

1343
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:25,680
my program meets you where you are.

1344
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:30,360
And that's the whole thing with Jerry to
watch where he is on the last episode.

1345
01:03:30,361 --> 01:03:32,550
I won't tell you what happened because I
know eventually you'll get around to it

1346
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:34,020
and you're going to be like,
wow,

1347
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:37,770
this fucking shit's crazy and for,
to answer your question on the back,

1348
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:42,780
all I can think of is I'm constantly
lengthening and strengthening.

1349
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:47,940
Like I stretched my whole wrestling,
my whole athletic career right up those

1350
01:03:47,941 --> 01:03:50,820
42 and three quarters when I blew my
back out.

1351
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:53,490
I stretch.
So stretching is great,

1352
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:58,350
but it's not the end all be all.
I'm stretching and strengthening the

1353
01:03:58,351 --> 01:04:00,030
muscles,
ligaments and tendons.

1354
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:04,560
When you use the resistance and a
dynamic time under tension,

1355
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,830
when you do that,
it elevates your heart rate.

1356
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:09,810
Think about this.
You're at the head laying down your

1357
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:11,040
heart rate's the lowest ever,
right?

1358
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:12,840
Sit Up.
What happened?

1359
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:14,460
Your heart rate goes up,
stand,

1360
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:16,350
walk,
jog,

1361
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:17,810
sprint,
boom,

1362
01:04:17,811 --> 01:04:18,121
boom,
boom,

1363
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:18,954
boom,
boom.

1364
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,240
That's what I'm doing.
When I had you flex your quads,

1365
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:23,070
flexed your glutes,
grab the ball,

1366
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:23,761
openness,
fingers,

1367
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:26,170
wide movement,
resistance of guarantee.

1368
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:27,960
Your heart rate.
If you're starting at 80,

1369
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:31,470
it went to 105.
One hundred and 15 or 20.

1370
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:36,770
I can take my heart rate from 90 to 140
by 135 like that,

1371
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:42,360
and I mean two minutes standing still
and that's not yoga.

1372
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:45,540
That's DDP.
Why?

1373
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:50,130
And I've been wearing a heart monitor
doing this for over 18 years,

1374
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:53,730
so it's more physically intensive.
It can be more strength.

1375
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:55,710
It can be,
like I said,

1376
01:04:55,711 --> 01:04:58,030
I did 10,
ten second pushups almost second

1377
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:58,740
birthday.
So you,

1378
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:01,530
but you still haven't gotten an MRI done
some.

1379
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,510
I've done.
So you just figured fuck.

1380
01:05:03,511 --> 01:05:06,840
It feels good.
Going to pay for that to see what it is

1381
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:10,950
because I know that there are,
it is possible to gain some space.

1382
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,870
Oh,
I believe it has to be there.

1383
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:16,140
They've done it with decompression.
They've done it with,

1384
01:05:16,141 --> 01:05:16,974
uh,
you know,

1385
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:21,060
various exercises and things that people
do that do lengthen the spine,

1386
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:22,510
stretch you out.
And there's A.

1387
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:25,030
I have a bunch of things out back.
I'll show you some of the things that

1388
01:05:25,031 --> 01:05:27,160
they,
they've people have created to

1389
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:29,060
decompress the spine,
you know.

1390
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:32,370
Do you ever use one of those teeter
things where you hanging clinicals a

1391
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:35,560
lot.
I literally get out of my hyperbaric

1392
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:36,580
chamber.
Let's talk about that.

1393
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:38,770
What do you know about?
Never done it,

1394
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:43,180
but I've heard amazing things from UFC
guys that have fought and had pretty

1395
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:47,440
significant injuries,
handbrakes muscle damage and gotten

1396
01:05:47,441 --> 01:05:51,280
there and had some pretty,
pretty rapid recovery because of it.

1397
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:52,190
My,
my,

1398
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:56,800
my doctor who she's my endocrinologist
when I told her I was doing and she

1399
01:05:56,801 --> 01:05:57,634
goes,
Old Dallas,

1400
01:05:57,710 --> 01:06:01,330
I can tell you I,
I know it can only help you.

1401
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,030
She goes,
the only story I have about,

1402
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:07,720
I don't know enough about it.
She said I had a woman who had radiation

1403
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:10,240
therapy,
so she had an open wound from her breast

1404
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:14,050
cancer and it wouldn't close for over
two years,

1405
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:17,470
centered down to emory.
Finally put her night Berg Chamber.

1406
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,270
Three months later,
100 percent healed.

1407
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,700
Same things happens with people with
diabetes.

1408
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,960
So I had heard like Lebron had it,
you know,

1409
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:26,470
because I don't,
I never saw an article on him,

1410
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:28,540
but I just heard people talking about
it,

1411
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:30,220
you know,
in different areas that he had won.

1412
01:06:30,221 --> 01:06:31,960
Coby had one.
They have them in their house.

1413
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:34,000
That's what I heard.
I don't know if they do or they don't.

1414
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:38,860
I just heard it.
So it got me thinking in my house that I

1415
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:40,260
was just,
I just let it.

1416
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:43,630
It's called the accountability crib and
I'm about to put this out there

1417
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:44,464
everywhere.

1418
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,110
It's when I moved jake into my home in
Atlanta,

1419
01:06:47,111 --> 01:06:50,500
I just bought it and it was all about
being accountability.

1420
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:52,190
One of my friends,
Christina and uh,

1421
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:55,030
sent me a list of names.
I want to call this something.

1422
01:06:55,031 --> 01:06:58,120
I put it out there on the Internet and
she sent me like 22 names and one of

1423
01:06:58,121 --> 01:07:01,330
them is the accountability crib.
So that's what I call it DDPS

1424
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:03,910
accountability crib.
And you got to be accountable for

1425
01:07:03,911 --> 01:07:06,310
everything.
And the thing,

1426
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:10,930
I love that home,
but it was 22 steps to get to my bedroom

1427
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,160
and my knees are bone on bone.
So going down was a drag.

1428
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:18,820
So I figured fuck it,
I'm going to buy a new home master on

1429
01:07:18,821 --> 01:07:20,830
main and I'm going to build this,
you know,

1430
01:07:20,831 --> 01:07:25,090
I have this place that I can bring in
top athletes that want to be healed,

1431
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:25,840
you know.

1432
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:30,840
So going back to the crib,
I'm making that like an airbnb now.

1433
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:32,650
And,
or have like the steak Robert Suite,

1434
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,610
the um,
uh,

1435
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:37,280
the uh,
razor Ramon suite to DDP sweet.

1436
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:38,950
Yeah.
So that'll be pretty cool.

1437
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:42,760
That's going to happen next week.
We're going to get into is hyperbaric

1438
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,020
chamber.
Great.

1439
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,180
Why doesn't Lebron Shave his head?
What's going on with that?

1440
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:49,660
Someone explained that there's some so
much fuckery going on with his hair.

1441
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:50,861
Wow,
okay.

1442
01:07:50,861 --> 01:07:53,650
That looks a lot,
but mine.

1443
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:58,730
I would venture to say that he is not at
12 psi on that thing and what that means

1444
01:08:00,101 --> 01:08:04,300
is pounds per square inch.
If you're like 10,

1445
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:07,960
say 10 feet below sea level,
that's about four pounds per square

1446
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:09,190
inch.
You get know it just goes up.

1447
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:14,220
Twenty would be like eight,
eight pound per square at 12 pounds per

1448
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:17,270
square inch.
The pressure is there.

1449
01:08:17,271 --> 01:08:19,040
An takes like 10 minutes to get up
there.

1450
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,650
Like you're blowing your nose.
Like wow.

1451
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,460
You know,
like just getting air,

1452
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:25,760
getting your,
you'll fix your ears and all that shit.

1453
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:31,330
But what happens when you get to 12 psi
now it breaks the brain barrier and the

1454
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:35,960
oxygen will go to your brain.
So this is.

1455
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:39,290
I didn't know any of this shit till I
sit next to a guy named Brad Campbell

1456
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:41,600
who's like an angel,
this cat.

1457
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,280
And we just started talking on a plane
and at some point I said,

1458
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:47,930
man,
how old are you anyway?

1459
01:08:47,931 --> 01:08:49,730
Sounds like you do a lot of shit.
And he says,

1460
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,650
I'm thinking.
He looks at the Max 45,

1461
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,120
maybe 40.
He goes,

1462
01:08:53,121 --> 01:08:54,850
I'm 57.
I go,

1463
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,420
you're 57.
I said,

1464
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:58,820
how the fuck you look like that?
He said,

1465
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:01,620
I've been living in a hyperbaric chamber
for the last 14 years.

1466
01:09:01,621 --> 01:09:03,920
So he's a Weirdo kid away from me.

1467
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,570
Right.
I said,

1468
01:09:05,571 --> 01:09:09,530
how did that happen?
Is that I was diagnosed with ms 22 years

1469
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:11,870
ago.
Oh Wow.

1470
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,810
Right.
And using that to keep the MS and check.

1471
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:19,840
He told me that when he gets a 12 PSI
and it goes to your brain,

1472
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:23,240
and this would be layman's terms.
Okay.

1473
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,320
Like when you get ms kind of like
crystallized on your brain,

1474
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,380
right?
And when the crystals fill up,

1475
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:36,010
where do they go next down your spine,
hence became the Walker,

1476
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:41,750
the chair.
So what somebody.

1477
01:09:41,751 --> 01:09:46,751
I don't know who the person was who
figured out 20 days in a chamber.

1478
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,510
And it's all about consistency.
You do it once or twice,

1479
01:09:50,511 --> 01:09:52,790
you're going to feel better a little
bit,

1480
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:57,140
but you do it like consistent,
like 20 days,

1481
01:09:57,141 --> 01:10:00,140
like they do their take off five days.
You do that four times.

1482
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:05,960
You do your Mri on your brain before you
start and after there's a kid named

1483
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:09,590
Daniel Bryan who is one of the biggest
stores in professional wrestling and a

1484
01:10:09,591 --> 01:10:13,490
couple of years ago he had to retire at
the height of his career and he was the

1485
01:10:13,491 --> 01:10:17,630
hottest guy on the planet at the time
and he wasn't a big guy,

1486
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:22,640
but he was the number one guy in the
business and he had to retire because of

1487
01:10:22,641 --> 01:10:23,474
concussions.

1488
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:26,150
Well,
he's back and I haven't talked to them

1489
01:10:26,151 --> 01:10:28,600
directly about this,
but I did hear that he was using a

1490
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:30,950
hyperbaric chamber to help heal his
brain.

1491
01:10:30,951 --> 01:10:33,590
Now again,
while he's telling me this story,

1492
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:36,800
I'm not thinking about them as,
but I'm thinking I've been hit in the

1493
01:10:36,801 --> 01:10:38,380
head a lot.
You know,

1494
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:40,490
I've been knocked out a shitload of
time,

1495
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:42,770
but I knocked out a shit load of guys by
accident.

1496
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:44,990
But you know,
they weren't trying to knock me out

1497
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,540
either,
but it's not checkers out there.

1498
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:50,390
So it I've been hit in the head with
chairs and all that shit.

1499
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:53,500
So how do you guys do that?
How do you hit some of these?

1500
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:56,030
Supposed to go with it.
Here's the deal.

1501
01:10:56,090 --> 01:11:00,680
If I walk up to you and we're about to
go out there and I'm going to slap the

1502
01:11:00,681 --> 01:11:02,180
shit,
I don't do it anymore.

1503
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,310
But in the old days if I'm going to hit
you in a chair,

1504
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,730
you got to hit it like even right?
I'd say,

1505
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:09,590
hey dude,
I'm going to say I'm sorry right now.

1506
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,530
And you would say back to me and we'll
come with a motherfucker.

1507
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:16,150
Don't make it weak.
I mean that's what you would say because

1508
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,450
if we're going to shoot an angle on it,
let's go with it.

1509
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,210
But don't you think that back when you
were 35,

1510
01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:23,000
they didn't understand traumatic brain
injury.

1511
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:24,720
That's why they let us do it.
They don't want to.

1512
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:28,650
They don't see that anymore.
But you remember when Dennis Rodman

1513
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:29,790
wrestled?
Yes.

1514
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:33,090
Well,
that was when I got Karl Malone involved

1515
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:36,690
and it was me and Karl Malone against
Rodman and Hogan.

1516
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:40,710
It was fucking huge.
I took my name to a different level,

1517
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:45,480
but robin was supposed to be a practice
that day in Detroit.

1518
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:50,460
We were in Detroit that night with metro
and he,

1519
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:54,930
him and Hogan.
I'm about to do this announcement and

1520
01:11:54,931 --> 01:11:57,990
him and Hogan come from the back and
whack me with chairs.

1521
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,200
Now this is Dennis Rodman.
Alright.

1522
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:01,320
Right.
He's not one of the boys.

1523
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:05,270
He doesn't know.
You've got to lay it flat if you in and

1524
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,170
there's a,
there was some big like probably like a

1525
01:12:07,171 --> 01:12:08,090
mat,
you know,

1526
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:12,030
from a wrestling like the collegiate
wrestlers wrestle on.

1527
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:15,570
So this big roll of rubber was there.
It was probably about three feet off the

1528
01:12:15,571 --> 01:12:17,430
ground.
And I said,

1529
01:12:17,431 --> 01:12:20,460
I know you've never swung a chair
before,

1530
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:24,480
so let me show you something.
And I picked my hands up with a chair

1531
01:12:24,481 --> 01:12:26,880
and then I'd lower him down just right
on top of it.

1532
01:12:26,881 --> 01:12:29,370
Then I'd pick them up at low room flat.
I said,

1533
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,720
you see,
I'll flag it is right.

1534
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:33,360
And I took it up and I hit it as hard as
I could.

1535
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:34,650
Boom.
I said,

1536
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:36,930
if you hit me like that,
we're good.

1537
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,330
And then I just turned with my left
hand,

1538
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:42,040
move down a little more.
So now the railing of the chair headed

1539
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,610
and to put a big getting it.
I said,

1540
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:47,730
if you hit me like that,
you break my rips.

1541
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,630
I said,
so please let me see you do it.

1542
01:12:51,631 --> 01:12:52,710
Hit a fly.
He was great,

1543
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:55,620
you know?
And they came out and it was on espn

1544
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:59,700
that night because he was supposed to be
a practice and hear his fucking around

1545
01:12:59,701 --> 01:13:02,760
with us.
So on a shoot and the angle or metro.

1546
01:13:02,761 --> 01:13:06,510
So it was pretty cool.
But it's all about laying it flat and

1547
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:10,180
then you'll see how it's not checkers,
it's not fucking checkers.

1548
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:13,170
The one of the most disturbing things I
ever saw was brock lesnar doing that

1549
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:15,600
flip off the top rope and landing on his
head.

1550
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,850
Oh my God.
Not a lot of human beings that would

1551
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:21,270
even survive that.
And then he goes on to complete the pin.

1552
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,790
He,
how the fuck did he not get knocked

1553
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:27,870
unconscious from that and how the fuck
did he not have permanent spinal injury

1554
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:30,270
from that and he is 300 pounds at the
time.

1555
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:33,360
I tell everybody,
you know what you fucking want about

1556
01:13:33,361 --> 01:13:36,990
fresh and wrestling.
You can't fake gravity.

1557
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:40,440
That little fucker that was flipping in
the air.

1558
01:13:40,441 --> 01:13:42,450
I mean he's,
he's the baddest motherfucker alive as

1559
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:47,430
far as our maturity survived the hundred
pounds flying through the air,

1560
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:51,240
landing on the top of his neck.
And then you watched it was this,

1561
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:55,150
here was this shared heritage with look
at the size of the is.

1562
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:58,350
Oh,
that is so fucked up.

1563
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:01,350
That is so fucked up.
Look at him grabbing his head.

1564
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,660
Oh,
I mean he landed on his fucking head.

1565
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:05,700
How is he alive?
I don't know.

1566
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:07,470
He's not.
I missed that.

1567
01:14:07,471 --> 01:14:09,670
So bad is Cyborg.
Know.

1568
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,560
I mean he's one of the best fuckers
landed

1569
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:17,330
on his head and this was before and look
at this and the other band is

1570
01:14:18,461 --> 01:14:23,260
motherfuckers right there.
Next door was also completely fucked up

1571
01:14:23,261 --> 01:14:24,120
from wrestling.
I mean,

1572
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:26,380
his arms,
both of his arms were completely

1573
01:14:26,381 --> 01:14:30,160
atrophied because he said so many spinal
surgeries and spinal injuries.

1574
01:14:30,161 --> 01:14:34,630
His neck has completely fused up.
I begged Kim and Olympic gold medalist,

1575
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:38,080
legit Olympic gold medalist and
wrestling broke his neck.

1576
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:41,170
Yes,
for and still wants to one again,

1577
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,870
one of the best parks.
But again,

1578
01:14:43,871 --> 01:14:45,370
this,
this job,

1579
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:47,080
which is why,
you know,

1580
01:14:47,081 --> 01:14:48,670
I mean,
it's obviously,

1581
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:49,990
it's a work.
Everyone's,

1582
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:51,460
it's work,
it's entertainment,

1583
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:55,420
but physically demanding in terms of
physically demanding crazy.

1584
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,970
It might be more physically demanding
than a sport.

1585
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,500
You know,
it's right up there.

1586
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,020
The only thing I could think that might
be as bad,

1587
01:15:02,021 --> 01:15:04,810
but they don't do it every day is bull
riding.

1588
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,370
I don't even know if that's a sport
that's just crazy.

1589
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:11,560
People.
Pretty nutty.

1590
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:13,480
I had a friend of mine who,
uh,

1591
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:18,630
has done it and he had eight or nine
shoulder surgeries.

1592
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,280
His shoulder was just shredded.
It was just,

1593
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:24,010
it was just all these cut marks all over
his shoulders.

1594
01:15:24,011 --> 01:15:27,430
It just blown apart and they stitch it
back together and blew it apart and

1595
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:28,870
stitch it back together again.
It's like,

1596
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:32,320
how about stop riding fucking 2000 pound
animals,

1597
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:34,390
Bro,
I don't want to fuck one of those six

1598
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,550
are,
they're just so crazy coming out of the

1599
01:15:36,551 --> 01:15:38,110
gate.
You can't control that at all.

1600
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:39,580
No,
you can't control that at all.

1601
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:42,320
So the guys who had those runs are
pretty banged up and the other guy's

1602
01:15:42,321 --> 01:15:43,660
like,
I've just started,

1603
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:46,210
you know,
I'm talking to a pardot to who is the

1604
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:50,470
president of the NFL alumni and we've
been talking about doing something for

1605
01:15:50,471 --> 01:15:54,400
the guys and again,
when I do shit like that I just give it

1606
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:56,590
to them just to help them.

1607
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:58,630
And I've talked to a few of the players.
I got a few guys,

1608
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:01,450
you know,
loving it and so it just,

1609
01:16:01,451 --> 01:16:03,600
again,
helping them with because there's,

1610
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,040
you know,
those guys are all weight lifting,

1611
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:09,490
running.
We can't do either now because you're so

1612
01:16:09,491 --> 01:16:11,850
beat up.
So it'll let you know.

1613
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,350
It's funny when we watched,
you know,

1614
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,340
I'm sure you watched the superbowl when
they had the 50th anniversary a couple

1615
01:16:16,341 --> 01:16:20,170
of years back and all the mvps that came
out there just,

1616
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:22,720
it was brutal to watch how beat up they
are.

1617
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:25,300
The only guy who,
of course Jerry Rice looks like he could

1618
01:16:25,301 --> 01:16:28,030
still play because that's a rubbish to
the greatest.

1619
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:32,050
He's just a freaking super athlete and
somehow I don't know what all the crazy

1620
01:16:32,051 --> 01:16:34,510
shots he's been hit with that he had
survived.

1621
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:37,750
But there are certain people I always
say they could eat plastic,

1622
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:40,420
like they can do anything.
And um,

1623
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:42,750
you know,
you said Herschel Walker prefer that.

1624
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,200
Still wants to fight.
He was fighting in strikeforce when he's

1625
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:48,570
48 years old.
I watched,

1626
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:52,180
built like a fucking 20 year old freak
of nature fully shredded.

1627
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,520
And then,
you know,

1628
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,410
I mean,
you really have to stop and think if

1629
01:16:56,411 --> 01:17:00,100
that guy did fight when he was in his
twenties instead of in his forties,

1630
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:01,030
late forties,
right.

1631
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:03,400
He could have been a world champion and
I'm not bullshitting.

1632
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:05,600
He's that kind of a freak athlete.
He,

1633
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:10,100
he wasn't my claim to fame is with him,
was his

1634
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:14,590
last big run for Dallas.
He caught the ball and ran 67 yards into

1635
01:17:14,591 --> 01:17:19,590
the ends on this is like 1997 and he put
the ball between his hands to deny

1636
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:23,300
mccarter side and did the bank.
But if you didn't know because he put

1637
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:26,450
the ball in there if it was battery with
doing something else.

1638
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:27,840
And one of my friends,
uh,

1639
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:31,260
who had a show,
a radio show into a craig in,

1640
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,610
he had it in Arizona.
He called me up,

1641
01:17:34,611 --> 01:17:35,444
he goes,
D,

1642
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,970
I'm having Walker on the show today.
He goes,

1643
01:17:37,971 --> 01:17:39,720
do you want to sit in the wings?
I'll ask him if he,

1644
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:42,590
if he did the diamond cutter or not.
And it's called Dude,

1645
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:45,800
I definitely want to hear that.
So he put me on the phone and the wings

1646
01:17:45,801 --> 01:17:47,240
and I'm waiting there.
And he said,

1647
01:17:47,241 --> 01:17:48,770
so what happened that day?
Uh,

1648
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:49,580
what,
what,

1649
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:51,530
what,
what was that thing you did with the

1650
01:17:51,531 --> 01:17:52,580
ball?
He goes,

1651
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:52,871
well,
you know,

1652
01:17:52,871 --> 01:17:56,300
in the big WCW fan.
And I really liked Diamond Dallas page

1653
01:17:56,301 --> 01:17:58,970
and I felt like bang.
And I just did it and did a bang and

1654
01:17:58,971 --> 01:17:59,804
everything,
and he goes,

1655
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:01,430
well,
he's on the air right now with you.

1656
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:02,450
It's like,
get outta here.

1657
01:18:02,451 --> 01:18:04,830
And we became buddies out of it.
I lost touch with them since then,

1658
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:05,900
buddy.
Guy.

1659
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,470
Hilarious.
What I think you're doing and what I

1660
01:18:09,471 --> 01:18:11,990
think that one of the best benefits of
yoga,

1661
01:18:11,991 --> 01:18:16,460
and I'm sure the same with ddpy said
you're connecting everything together.

1662
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:20,210
Whereas like yoga and sprinting,
all this explosive exercise,

1663
01:18:20,211 --> 01:18:22,610
it's building up the muscles,
but what you're doing is you're

1664
01:18:22,611 --> 01:18:26,030
tightening up all the joints.
You're tightening up the core and the

1665
01:18:26,031 --> 01:18:27,590
joints,
and this is the thing that people are

1666
01:18:27,591 --> 01:18:30,830
missing that a lot of people are missing
that are really into fitness and

1667
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:33,590
exercise.
They're doing all this explosive stuff,

1668
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:37,700
but what's connecting everything
together is what blows out the knees,

1669
01:18:37,701 --> 01:18:38,990
the ankles,
the shoulders,

1670
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:40,700
the back,
and this.

1671
01:18:40,701 --> 01:18:43,940
This is something that's missing from a
lot of people's work because it's not as

1672
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:45,230
glamorous,
right?

1673
01:18:45,231 --> 01:18:47,200
It's not like you do biceps.
You buys,

1674
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:49,280
get all pumped up,
you do chest,

1675
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,260
you get all pumped up,
you look great.

1676
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:54,950
It's a different thing.
When you're doing is for overall body

1677
01:18:54,951 --> 01:18:59,330
maintenance and health and just
connecting all these parts together in a

1678
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:02,090
way that makes the whole unit stronger
and healthier.

1679
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:04,770
And again,
that's where I was saying I'm stretching

1680
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,860
and strengthening.
Just think about going over your head

1681
01:19:08,070 --> 01:19:11,140
and reaching up what you know.
When I started class,

1682
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:16,490
like I just had 175 people pay to be a
part of a workshop that I do called

1683
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:20,580
inspiration meets perspiration and I
guarantee you two things.

1684
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:22,290
I'm going,
I'm so jacked up,

1685
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,240
I'm so inspired.
They're to feel like they could run

1686
01:19:24,241 --> 01:19:27,510
through a brick wall and two,
they're going to sweat their ass off,

1687
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:31,590
but I met,
but the it where they are on whatever

1688
01:19:31,591 --> 01:19:34,920
level,
so the person who might be 400 pounds

1689
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:40,280
and the person who shredded over there
can get a good workout at the same time

1690
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:44,440
because I'm showing him how to do that
modification over there and he might

1691
01:19:44,441 --> 01:19:46,800
even have a chair and this guy,
I'm going to go deep.

1692
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:47,663
No,
no,

1693
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:48,503
go deep.

1694
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,750
Now let me show you this.
Now grab the ball opened up and then

1695
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,790
pull.
But before I start,

1696
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:55,650
one of those things,
because there's people there who come

1697
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,570
because they hear it yoga,
right,

1698
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,770
right.
And I walk,

1699
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:00,810
y'all got my mic on and I go,
I'm walking.

1700
01:20:00,811 --> 01:20:04,260
I go,
if you came here for the yoga where you

1701
01:20:04,261 --> 01:20:06,990
reach your arms to heaven,
sorta the universe smiles back.

1702
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:08,910
You and I dropped my arms.
I go,

1703
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,920
we won't be doing any of that shit
tonight.

1704
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:15,180
What kind of Yoga did you start with?
Power Yoga was.

1705
01:20:15,181 --> 01:20:17,240
I was.
So he never did.

1706
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,500
Like,
no,

1707
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:23,660
I've done everything I've done.
I've done all of them at least once just

1708
01:20:24,331 --> 01:20:28,350
to try like I respect yoga at a
different level,

1709
01:20:28,351 --> 01:20:31,200
like as much as any.
Like what's really funny,

1710
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:34,680
he's like guys like Brian Kest and
shipper ray and there was a,

1711
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:38,850
my buddy mine,
Arthur Klein did a movie called why Yoga

1712
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:44,480
and in it he gives me a camera and it
was the second time I went to Iraq and I

1713
01:20:45,381 --> 01:20:50,360
filmed all this shit and meet with the
guys and then go interview and I wasn't

1714
01:20:50,361 --> 01:20:54,210
interviewing someone else's interviewing
him for me and it got this great,

1715
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:55,770
great stuff.

1716
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,820
But in the beginning I'm talking about
how like I literally was interviewed

1717
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:03,360
when I wrote the Book Yoga for regular
guys and I get it.

1718
01:21:03,361 --> 01:21:07,460
It was smoking hot chicks and regular
guys because back then I met TNF,

1719
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:11,370
you when I said it and I never thought
women would love the workout the way

1720
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:13,440
they do and those this year that you put
this together,

1721
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:17,670
2005.
So I was interviewed by this guy from

1722
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:22,671
the Wall Street Journal and literally he
quoted me saying when Kimberly had asked

1723
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:27,630
me if I would do the yoga,
I was like fuck that I wouldn't be

1724
01:21:27,631 --> 01:21:31,860
caught dead doing yoga.
And he put in there after Dash Dash,

1725
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:34,140
dash that I wouldn't be caught dead
doing yoga.

1726
01:21:34,141 --> 01:21:35,880
So that's in the beginning of the movie,
right?

1727
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:38,460
So the Yogis like,
hey me.

1728
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:43,410
But by the time it gets to the end where
they see like I'm just putting a

1729
01:21:43,411 --> 01:21:46,800
different spin on it and I'm not trying
to do what you're doing,

1730
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,340
but similar writing as far as I'm
concerned,

1731
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,420
more benefits.

1732
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:52,920
Now,
when you say power yoga,

1733
01:21:52,921 --> 01:21:54,660
for people who've never done yoga
before,

1734
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:56,010
differ.
Differentiate.

1735
01:21:56,040 --> 01:22:00,120
Like what does that mean when you say
power yoga versus something like Bikram

1736
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:03,440
Yoga?
I'm being remiss to me personally,

1737
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:06,420
I don't want to be that hot.
I don't want to be in a hot room.

1738
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:11,421
I want to hate my body up in the cold so
I don't want to put myself in a position

1739
01:22:11,911 --> 01:22:15,600
where it's so hot that I can go farther
than I've ever come before because then

1740
01:22:15,601 --> 01:22:18,750
I'm going to walk out into the real
world and then I'm not going to get

1741
01:22:18,751 --> 01:22:20,880
that.
I want to be able to get what I get in

1742
01:22:20,881 --> 01:22:24,300
the real world and there's like,
I'm going to say I don't know how many

1743
01:22:24,301 --> 01:22:26,580
positions are,
I won't say there's 46 positions or

1744
01:22:26,581 --> 01:22:29,150
whatever it is and peegrum things.
Twenty eight,

1745
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,050
but whatever it was,
20 slash 27 slash 20.

1746
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:34,650
I can't remember.
But either way he trademarked that.

1747
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:38,570
So that like a news that in court
though.

1748
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,860
But uh,
I thought he won,

1749
01:22:40,861 --> 01:22:44,580
but who can either way on top of that,
I don't think it was his to begin with.

1750
01:22:44,581 --> 01:22:48,570
I think somebody else had had put all
those patterns together before him.

1751
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,640
Now,
and then probably so because again,

1752
01:22:50,641 --> 01:22:53,160
it's freaking yoga,
it's been around for thousands of years,

1753
01:22:53,161 --> 01:22:58,050
but for me,
what I do like the one time Chris

1754
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:58,920
Jericho and I were,
he was,

1755
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:02,190
he came by my house in La when I was
living here and we went out to the park

1756
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:03,420
and he's like,
so what do you do?

1757
01:23:03,421 --> 01:23:05,650
Do you do stand up one day,
you know,

1758
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,390
strength building or next?
I go Chris,

1759
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,590
I do it different every time.
I do the same open under the same

1760
01:23:11,591 --> 01:23:13,420
clothes,
but all the middle I go,

1761
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,380
it's like a match man.

1762
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:17,100
I'm making it up as I go along at times,
you know,

1763
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:19,000
and um,
improv because I'm seeing what you can

1764
01:23:19,001 --> 01:23:20,800
do and then I'm going to take a
different.

1765
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:23,020
I see you can really go,
well,

1766
01:23:23,021 --> 01:23:25,630
I'm going to push you to a different
level that I go to.

1767
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:30,430
If you can't then I'm going to back way
the fuck off because I don't want to

1768
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:32,050
burn you.
I want you to.

1769
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:34,390
I did it with Tito.
Tito Ortiz.

1770
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:39,340
One time he'd written something in a
sports illustrated,

1771
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:44,400
interviewed him and I had met him at a
strip joint in Vegas and he was the man

1772
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:49,600
in ufc at the time and he wanted to do,
they weren't making any money.

1773
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:52,930
You remember back in the beginning when
they weren't making any money and he

1774
01:23:52,931 --> 01:23:56,270
wanted to go to where we were.
Right.

1775
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:57,730
And I was like,
dude,

1776
01:23:58,330 --> 01:23:59,560
here's what I really feel.

1777
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:03,520
This shit you're doing is building crazy
momentum.

1778
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,860
I go,
we're at the top of where we're going to

1779
01:24:05,861 --> 01:24:09,790
go right now and it's so cyclical.
At some point it's going to fall out.

1780
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,920
I said,
it's whole different thing than what

1781
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:13,570
you're doing.
I know you appreciate it.

1782
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,870
Which I'm super excited about,
but bottom line is,

1783
01:24:16,871 --> 01:24:18,160
man,
stay where you are.

1784
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:20,800
And he's saying this in the SII
interview.

1785
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,440
Right?
So I still had his number and I called

1786
01:24:23,441 --> 01:24:25,000
them up and he answered the phone like,
Hey,

1787
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:26,800
do you know the gay?
Did he pay him?

1788
01:24:26,801 --> 01:24:27,341
Like,
Hey man,

1789
01:24:27,341 --> 01:24:29,470
I uh,
I saw what you said in,

1790
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:32,740
you told the story exact cause I talked
him out of it,

1791
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,370
like trying to go and told no stay where
you are,

1792
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:37,960
dude,
you're about to have a hell of a Rut.

1793
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:40,720
And he put that oversight.
I said,

1794
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:43,030
man,
you remember exactly where it went?

1795
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:43,781
And he said,
yeah.

1796
01:24:43,781 --> 01:24:44,441
He goes,
of course,

1797
01:24:44,441 --> 01:24:47,530
that's what was fighting again.
I heard that fight next month.

1798
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:50,230
I went down and worked out once
November.

1799
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,720
Yeah,
I worked out with them after his back

1800
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:54,810
surgery.
He said a bond back,

1801
01:24:54,830 --> 01:24:55,930
certain files.
The first one,

1802
01:24:56,380 --> 01:25:01,030
the first one I've worked with them and
I'm figuring this is [inaudible] and I'm

1803
01:25:01,031 --> 01:25:04,000
going to fricking push him to show him
how this will strengthen them.

1804
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,420
Then after that he wouldn't do it and I
finally pinned him down.

1805
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:09,490
I go,
why didn't you do it again?

1806
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:11,890
Because it was too fucking hard,
bro.

1807
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,353
I'm like,
dude,

1808
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:15,520
you say that you wouldn't have been as
fucks alive.

1809
01:25:15,521 --> 01:25:16,750
How could you?
And he's like,

1810
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:17,830
you know,
I just thought it was too.

1811
01:25:17,831 --> 01:25:22,810
I said I can make it super easy and
that's where I learned pack the fog off,

1812
01:25:22,811 --> 01:25:27,340
meaning me,
bring it where they need it and let me

1813
01:25:27,341 --> 01:25:30,280
show you how we can,
not like Cain Valasquez he was just down

1814
01:25:30,281 --> 01:25:31,114
in,
um,

1815
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:34,390
in um,
the performance center and wwe and I'm

1816
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:37,140
training the guys down there.
I go down for like a week at a time.

1817
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:40,420
I heard he's thinking about going into
pro wrestling after his career is over.

1818
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,350
Well,
I'll tell you what,

1819
01:25:41,351 --> 01:25:43,570
man.
He was another guy was at a shitload of

1820
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:46,390
back surgery and shoulder surgeries,
knee surgeries,

1821
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,680
and he,
you know,

1822
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:52,360
control huge money.
He really comes or such a natural,

1823
01:25:52,361 --> 01:25:55,450
as you can imagine,
a giant Mexican family.

1824
01:25:55,451 --> 01:25:58,090
Those are the
right,

1825
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:01,480
that doesn't really exist like that.
Whatever Mexican heavyweight champion

1826
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:03,440
for sports,
I watch it,

1827
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:04,160
man.
He's

1828
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,050
one of the greatest of all time,
if not the greatest.

1829
01:26:06,051 --> 01:26:07,970
He just,
his body couldn't keep up with his mind.

1830
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:10,220
His mind was so physically tough.
I mean it's.

1831
01:26:10,221 --> 01:26:13,790
Mine was so he was so mentally tough.
That is his physical body would start

1832
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:15,140
falling apart.
His knees,

1833
01:26:15,141 --> 01:26:18,040
his back shoulders.
It's just when you watch that got

1834
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,120
trained me,
he trains like nobody,

1835
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:23,950
him and Daniel Cormier,
we'll just go to a fucking war than

1836
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:25,970
happy for DC.
I mean,

1837
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:29,480
but he's awesome.
He's on a Thursday,

1838
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,910
Thursday.
Please tell we've never met,

1839
01:26:31,911 --> 01:26:36,911
but what we do and just want the uh,
fights in Dallas this weekend.

1840
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:38,181
Oh Great.
Yeah.

1841
01:26:38,181 --> 01:26:41,570
There's a UFC welterweight championships
in Dallas this weekend.

1842
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:42,650
Awesome.
Awesome.

1843
01:26:43,410 --> 01:26:45,520
I'm going to say before you said
Cormier,

1844
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,390
Tito Ortiz,
it was too difficult for him,

1845
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,580
you know,
that's when you learned to back the fuck

1846
01:26:49,581 --> 01:26:52,910
off and that Cain Velasquez Cain.
Wow,

1847
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:53,773
you're good.

1848
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,130
You should do this.
You should.

1849
01:26:56,370 --> 01:26:59,430
You should have a show how much
products.

1850
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:01,880
So when I,
when I was down there,

1851
01:27:01,881 --> 01:27:05,300
I did six workouts in full,
five d,

1852
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:09,320
six work.
I do double sessions and every single

1853
01:27:09,321 --> 01:27:11,060
session,
every day Kaine made four of them.

1854
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:13,870
And then yeah,
we changed numbers.

1855
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:17,120
I sent him my program or something.
That's heart monitor and I don't know if

1856
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:19,040
he's doing that.
I haven't checked back in and help him

1857
01:27:19,041 --> 01:27:21,200
tremendously.
Tremendously.

1858
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:22,820
Really.
Would you know,

1859
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:24,270
because that guy,
his whole issue is,

1860
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:27,340
has been really his back.
I mean there's other injuries,

1861
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:29,030
the shoulders and the knees and stuff
like that,

1862
01:27:29,031 --> 01:27:31,320
but they can fix those,
but then they can fix your back.

1863
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:33,770
The back is.
I know if he's doing it,

1864
01:27:33,771 --> 01:27:35,370
lose those discs,
you know,

1865
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:36,710
and I told him,
like I told you,

1866
01:27:36,711 --> 01:27:40,760
I said if you can get out to Atlanta,
like I'll personally work with you.

1867
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:43,910
It costs you this.
I just want you to have the results

1868
01:27:43,911 --> 01:27:45,590
because like,
Arthur,

1869
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:48,730
the results will speak for themselves.
Yeah.

1870
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:50,150
No,
I mean I,

1871
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:53,050
I'm a believer 100 percent and I just,
I,

1872
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:57,690
I can't say enough how impressed I am
that video with Arthur and that,

1873
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:00,800
that is one of the most impressive
transformation videos I think I've ever

1874
01:28:00,801 --> 01:28:02,750
seen online.
And that's saying a lot.

1875
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:08,090
That's when I found it on the Internet.
There's few things that they really

1876
01:28:08,511 --> 01:28:11,450
share.
Like when Steve First did that video,

1877
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:13,490
I looked at it and went,
man,

1878
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:15,800
you don't have a.
back then it was still,

1879
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:17,780
we were just branding it.
DDP Yoga.

1880
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:20,060
You don't have DDP Yoga Dot com when it
though,

1881
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:21,320
bro.
He goes,

1882
01:28:21,410 --> 01:28:26,410
I read a book and in the book,
remember this is 2011 and he started

1883
01:28:27,951 --> 01:28:31,410
read a book that talked about,
um,

1884
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,330
if you want something go viral,
it can't be an advertising ad.

1885
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,730
It has to be.
Unless it's super funny then that's

1886
01:28:37,731 --> 01:28:40,070
different you said,
but if you want,

1887
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:42,620
we use two things we can do here.
We can make it an ad.

1888
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:44,600
We can inspire people.
He goes,

1889
01:28:44,601 --> 01:28:47,180
what do you want to do?
I just let it inspired people.

1890
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:48,890
So then I watched it again,
right?

1891
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,170
And then I'm flushing it and I go,
fuck it.

1892
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,410
I'm a Yogi in there.
So I called them up.

1893
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:55,210
I go,
I go,

1894
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:57,920
I don't want to be.
I mean I love Yoga,

1895
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:00,500
but I don't want to go for doing your
own thing.

1896
01:29:00,530 --> 01:29:01,363
Right?
And he goes,

1897
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:02,160
I just

1898
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,540
want you to think about this.
And this is Steve.

1899
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:08,910
Steve is like an Ivy Leaguer,
graduated from Cornell,

1900
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:12,900
like super smart,
was literally on his way to being a top

1901
01:29:12,901 --> 01:29:16,050
guy at ibm and thought,
fuck that.

1902
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:19,800
I don't want to do that.
I want to inspire people,

1903
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:25,380
so he's only guy that I know is self
taught 100 percent how to edit,

1904
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,780
how to produce,
how to do everything,

1905
01:29:27,781 --> 01:29:29,910
and resurrection the snake.
When you see it,

1906
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,260
you'll know it.
That's his baby.

1907
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:35,730
That video is his baby.
So he said,

1908
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,230
just imagine this.
All right,

1909
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:41,850
yoga is gonna.
Want to take credit for all of this even

1910
01:29:41,851 --> 01:29:44,130
though it's our shit and it's different.
It's still,

1911
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:46,200
you know,
a version of.

1912
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:51,030
He said that'll end up on every yoga
studio wall ever.

1913
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:56,190
And that's what helped it go viral.
So remember we said that in the video

1914
01:29:56,191 --> 01:30:00,000
that had been turned away by [inaudible]
because he needed,

1915
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:00,870
he needed the chair.

1916
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:03,540
They didn't have any such thing.
They don't know how to incorporate that

1917
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:05,440
into their flow.
Right.

1918
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:10,320
I do see you just figured out the chair
is a balancing tool we have when we have

1919
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:12,300
some more people just sitting down and
we,

1920
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:15,510
we have like beginner beginner,
but by the time you come into my class,

1921
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,820
like when I'll do,
I'll go do a class and I'll be back.

1922
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:22,840
We'll let everybody know Tuesday of next
week I will be doing a class at DDP yoga

1923
01:30:22,861 --> 01:30:25,620
performance center.
It will be Jim and be able to fit people

1924
01:30:25,621 --> 01:30:28,020
in there,
but there'll be people with chairs and

1925
01:30:28,021 --> 01:30:29,380
there'll be people without them in.
No.

1926
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:33,720
The energy will be insane because I've
got you counting and you'll see like

1927
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:36,690
grabbed the ball.
Now grab a hold and work your back and

1928
01:30:36,691 --> 01:30:39,960
buys here and pull the breath.
Three,

1929
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:41,070
two,
one.

1930
01:30:41,071 --> 01:30:43,200
I'm engaging everything now.

1931
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,960
Negative rep,
so you're engaging again.

1932
01:30:45,961 --> 01:30:47,400
Again,
I want to get your heart rate up there

1933
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:51,630
and keep it there for you.
Are pro wrestling when you were 35?

1934
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:53,700
I was running nightclubs.
I was running nightclubs.

1935
01:30:53,701 --> 01:30:57,510
The nightclub business since I was 17.
They actually had any bounce.

1936
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:00,590
Didn't know how old they'd know it was
an old mouth because I was six,

1937
01:31:00,591 --> 01:31:05,591
four and 180 pounds,
but I was tall and I started bouncing

1938
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:09,000
when I was 18.
Once if I was 17 and get the hell out of

1939
01:31:09,001 --> 01:31:10,200
here.
You're not old enough,

1940
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:14,700
but I came back when I was 18 and then I
was bar backing and bartending and I was

1941
01:31:14,701 --> 01:31:19,080
running.
I ran a small rock and roll joint at 22

1942
01:31:19,081 --> 01:31:22,380
and a half years old and then I went to
Houston.

1943
01:31:22,381 --> 01:31:26,220
I lived down there for awhile and Honky
tonks scene was insane.

1944
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:30,150
Then I came back for a wedding and I.
There was a place in Asbury Park,

1945
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:31,650
New Jersey,
which is where I'm from,

1946
01:31:31,651 --> 01:31:32,484
the Jersey shore.

1947
01:31:32,990 --> 01:31:35,610
It's really funny.
I always tell people this from this same

1948
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:39,780
Jersey shore area,
me and Bambam baked lowe who is a future

1949
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:44,340
whole families to meet you already be.
And Danny Devito,

1950
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,500
Jack Nicholson,
Jon Bon Jovi,

1951
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,900
and Bruce Bracing.
Hope from that,

1952
01:31:48,901 --> 01:31:51,120
like saved Jersey shore area.
But,

1953
01:31:51,121 --> 01:31:52,230
um,
I,

1954
01:31:52,231 --> 01:31:54,630
uh,
I came back for a wedding and there was

1955
01:31:54,631 --> 01:31:56,690
this club opening up and so I went in
there.

1956
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:57,930
I talked to the guy and he goes,
well,

1957
01:31:57,931 --> 01:31:58,980
I need a head bartender.
I,

1958
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:02,350
I'm going to be a head bartender,
but I'll be a general manager and I'll

1959
01:32:02,351 --> 01:32:05,650
get behind the stick two days a week.
But this place was huge.

1960
01:32:05,651 --> 01:32:09,930
Like you stick the bar,
get behind the bar and bartender.

1961
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:13,020
No one's slower nights.
You get behind the stadium,

1962
01:32:13,050 --> 01:32:16,120
behind the stick.
The stick,

1963
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:17,170
right?
Well,

1964
01:32:17,171 --> 01:32:18,730
yeah,
we'll put our place was.

1965
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:20,230
It was huge.
It was a big.

1966
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:23,020
We had rock and roll and disco burst
time.

1967
01:32:23,021 --> 01:32:27,700
Bruce springsteen ever sang dancing in
the dark was kind of with a band called

1968
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:30,520
bystander and sang with them because you
know Bruce Van,

1969
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:35,440
two blocks one block away was the stone
pony where I watched him probably 18

1970
01:32:35,441 --> 01:32:38,530
sundays in a row play with a band called
cats on a smooth surface.

1971
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:41,200
You just jump up and start playing,
you know,

1972
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:44,860
and now how'd you go to pro wrestling?
So I was running a club.

1973
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:48,460
I tried it when I was 22.
That was right before I started to

1974
01:32:48,461 --> 01:32:49,870
actually,
you know,

1975
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:53,740
get a chance at running a club.
I had three matches.

1976
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:55,660
I sucked.
I talked,

1977
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:58,210
I talked my knee and when I was 12 years
old,

1978
01:32:58,630 --> 01:33:01,450
I mean I was like,
I love football and hockey.

1979
01:33:01,451 --> 01:33:04,120
Like in my mind I'm going to play
defensive end for the New York giants.

1980
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,850
I mean that's my mind at the time,
but then I walked back,

1981
01:33:06,851 --> 01:33:08,740
I hit by a car,
my face bounced off the hood,

1982
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:11,560
netsuite 42 feet and appointed him
ambassador Jesus Christ.

1983
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:16,620
No such thing as rehab in 1968.
So they wouldn't let me play football or

1984
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:19,550
hockey.
But there,

1985
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:21,730
here's the two sports that you were
broken.

1986
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:22,960
They're like,
you're young,

1987
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:26,080
you can't get a doctor to sign for you.
And they weren't going to sign for me.

1988
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:30,700
So they gave me two choices.
Baseball and basketball.

1989
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:34,180
I suck at both.
And baseball,

1990
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:37,510
you're going to have somebody basketball
you don't.

1991
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:40,700
And I didn't even make the team in
seventh grade and I didn't give a fuck

1992
01:33:40,701 --> 01:33:42,730
cause I didn't really like it.
When you say you gotTa have somebody,

1993
01:33:42,731 --> 01:33:44,110
what do you mean?
You have to have someone to throw the

1994
01:33:44,111 --> 01:33:46,900
ball back and forth with us.
You to have nine guys.

1995
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:50,680
You had to know yodlee seven.
You know that the play with another

1996
01:33:50,681 --> 01:33:53,110
seven or whatever and I just what you
want of course,

1997
01:33:53,111 --> 01:33:55,600
but whatever you can do to make work for
basketball,

1998
01:33:55,601 --> 01:33:58,120
you just need one.
You need a ball in a hoop.

1999
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:01,930
That's it.
And Eighth Grade I sat on the bench and

2000
01:34:01,931 --> 01:34:06,220
I'd never sat on the bench ever.
So I thought that's never happened to me

2001
01:34:06,221 --> 01:34:08,380
again.
And it taught me the greatest lesson.

2002
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:12,010
It taught me that summer I played every
day,

2003
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:14,800
all day long,
five hours a day,

2004
01:34:14,801 --> 01:34:18,190
minimum you when you're by yourself,
you'll lay ups,

2005
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:19,690
hooks,
foul shots,

2006
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:22,900
whatever you know.
And then games pickup in the beginning,

2007
01:34:23,150 --> 01:34:25,060
you know,
I didn't get picked up until the end

2008
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:27,880
maybe.
And then as time went on over that

2009
01:34:27,881 --> 01:34:29,440
summer,
kept getting better and better and

2010
01:34:29,441 --> 01:34:32,920
better and better.
My freshman year I started and we went

2011
01:34:32,921 --> 01:34:34,960
undefeated.
By my sophomore year I was playing

2012
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:39,250
varsity.
So I realized that work ethic equals

2013
01:34:39,251 --> 01:34:41,650
results.
So that was the huge lesson I learned

2014
01:34:41,651 --> 01:34:45,160
from that.
So now I'm 23 years old and I've,

2015
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:47,200
you know,
I hurt my knee,

2016
01:34:47,201 --> 01:34:49,660
I and I,
and I'm going to take some time off away

2017
01:34:49,661 --> 01:34:53,170
from the dream of being a wrestler and I
get caught in the booze,

2018
01:34:53,171 --> 01:34:57,210
the poets and the party because it's so
broad

2019
01:34:58,940 --> 01:34:59,773
of.

2020
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:06,290
And I was lucky that I had way of
parenting myself,

2021
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:08,390
like getting into that whole Party
scene,

2022
01:35:08,391 --> 01:35:11,690
which I did,
but slowly I kind of backed myself out a

2023
01:35:11,691 --> 01:35:15,830
little bit each year and I've got this
club in Fort Myers,

2024
01:35:15,831 --> 01:35:19,280
Florida time and this one I actually own
a little piece of my buddy Tony could

2025
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:22,040
pharaoh and couple other guys.
And

2026
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:26,010
One night I'm in,
I'm in the office and we had a camera at

2027
01:35:26,011 --> 01:35:29,120
the backdoor and camera at the front
door in this place would hold legally,

2028
01:35:29,121 --> 01:35:34,010
probably about 600 people.
We've got a thousand in there and I'm

2029
01:35:34,011 --> 01:35:36,170
looking to cameras.
That person walks in,

2030
01:35:36,171 --> 01:35:38,090
looks just like kicked the snake
Roberts.

2031
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:43,810
I'm a huge fan of Jake Roberts.
So I frigging you outside of the

2032
01:35:44,211 --> 01:35:46,160
building come around because I don't
want to walk through the people.

2033
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:47,720
And I go to this girl judy at the front.

2034
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:50,780
So I go to the guy just walked in here.
It looks like Jake Roberts.

2035
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:51,920
She was,
yeah,

2036
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,030
she goes,
I think it's him.

2037
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:56,540
So I practically go running it and
they're like a huge mark.

2038
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:58,200
And when I see him,
I slowed down

2039
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:04,790
over fanboy go one over bad boy.
So,

2040
01:36:04,791 --> 01:36:06,910
uh,
well he's up at the bar and I'm like,

2041
01:36:06,911 --> 01:36:07,431
uh,
Hey,

2042
01:36:07,431 --> 01:36:09,440
uh,
you get snake Roberts.

2043
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:15,010
Who wants to know
is it the guy who runs this place?

2044
01:36:15,051 --> 01:36:16,070
He goes,
yeah,

2045
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:17,540
I go,
what are we drinking?

2046
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:21,230
And that's how we started.
So it's really crazy that in

2047
01:36:21,231 --> 01:36:24,920
resurrection I help him not drink again.
It is amazing.

2048
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:29,370
I mean this had that happening.
Then of course I paid for his drinks and

2049
01:36:29,371 --> 01:36:32,080
next of Ted dibiase there,
push whackers.

2050
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,920
They are really cool.
The guy from the eighties,

2051
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:36,950
if you wrestled in Tampa then you had to
go to Miami.

2052
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:40,820
Well,
Fort Myers was the perfect location,

2053
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:45,020
so they had seen all these different.
These boys come in through that,

2054
01:36:45,021 --> 01:36:47,510
right?
So I did all my own radio commercials

2055
01:36:47,511 --> 01:36:50,130
back then.
So back then it might be like Thursday,

2056
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:54,550
Thursday hot legs.
And then I might throw in Uja ticket

2057
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,430
thinking,
thinking,

2058
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:00,770
thinking.
And people didn't know if it was randy

2059
01:37:00,771 --> 01:37:05,240
or a hole or jessie or whoever.
And I never told anybody.

2060
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:08,400
Right?
So they do this interview on

2061
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:12,510
the voice because this is Fort Myers,
it's a little.

2062
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,840
It's called a party news network.
My Buddy Kevin,

2063
01:37:15,050 --> 01:37:17,370
that we're going to do a spot on you on
the news network.

2064
01:37:17,371 --> 01:37:17,991
I'm like,
okay.

2065
01:37:17,991 --> 01:37:20,180
So they filmed me and my 62 pink
Cadillac.

2066
01:37:20,181 --> 01:37:24,410
They fill me at the studio.
Sixty two pink cadillac convertible.

2067
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:26,960
It was,
yeah,

2068
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:30,080
it was the board.
It was the first divorce wife I never

2069
01:37:30,081 --> 01:37:30,914
had.

2070
01:37:32,490 --> 01:37:36,030
I just saw one go by.
I eventually sold it because you're

2071
01:37:36,031 --> 01:37:37,670
constantly putting.
I wore.

2072
01:37:37,671 --> 01:37:40,310
I drove it all the time.
I love that.

2073
01:37:40,311 --> 01:37:45,210
That's when you supposed to keep on
convertible.

2074
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,750
It was bad.
As bad as another bruce springsteen

2075
01:37:47,751 --> 01:37:49,220
song.
Dude it fucking great song.

2076
01:37:49,221 --> 01:37:50,310
That was.
Oh Man.

2077
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:53,810
The best.
We actually at that club gave away.

2078
01:37:53,811 --> 01:37:56,940
It was like a 68 pink cadillac
convertible.

2079
01:37:57,220 --> 01:38:01,740
[inaudible] 60 to 62 pink cadillac
convertible.

2080
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,570
There's Google is probably a picture of
his.

2081
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:08,030
There's a picture of me with three hot
smoking hot diamond dolls in my hallway.

2082
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:14,820
It's got sober on their
fucking cars or any other pictures.

2083
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:19,190
We could see the front of it.
There's a what?

2084
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,310
A car?
No,

2085
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,290
that's not it,
but that's,

2086
01:38:21,350 --> 01:38:23,940
that's like 61.
That's a hard top.

2087
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,190
That's an old.
It's got to have the wings on the

2088
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:28,410
bottom.
Go to that last one that you just went

2089
01:38:28,411 --> 01:38:28,890
to.
Ooh,

2090
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:30,960
look at that one.
That last convertible one.

2091
01:38:30,961 --> 01:38:33,040
You went to one one before that.
Oh,

2092
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:34,080
that's like a 56.

2093
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:37,890
Crudites.
Fifty nine.

2094
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,240
That's my favorite.
Look at that.

2095
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,300
That's the 70,
right?

2096
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:40,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

2097
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:44,820
Seventy fucking car.
God Damn.

2098
01:38:44,821 --> 01:38:46,020
They made some cars.
Go,

2099
01:38:46,021 --> 01:38:46,890
go,
go back to that.

2100
01:38:46,891 --> 01:38:48,540
Did shout at me in the watchman called
there.

2101
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:52,530
It's so funny because back then there is
the guide

2102
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:57,350
right there.
Um,

2103
01:38:57,470 --> 01:39:01,020
I am 31 years old.
That is if you guys want to read a

2104
01:39:01,021 --> 01:39:02,850
really great,
like super detailed,

2105
01:39:02,851 --> 01:39:04,750
like insanely long.
Um,

2106
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:09,660
it's called a letter to my younger self
players' tribune.

2107
01:39:10,170 --> 01:39:14,220
And so we're writing this Yo,
it's so fucking long.

2108
01:39:14,221 --> 01:39:16,490
I'm like,
I've let me cut back on some of drag.

2109
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:16,861
No,
no.

2110
01:39:16,861 --> 01:39:21,390
We need more detail.
And then it goes to 9,000 words and then

2111
01:39:21,391 --> 01:39:22,890
they want more detail that it goes.

2112
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:30,450
Look at that hair.
That's a 19 eighties head of hair.

2113
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:35,010
Shit.
The cops looking at you from behind.

2114
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:39,750
What the fuck?
I'm a manager that so don't let me give

2115
01:39:39,751 --> 01:39:43,290
you the backstory of it.
It's so my backup backup.

2116
01:39:43,291 --> 01:39:48,160
That's the money pitcher right there.
How will we know?

2117
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:50,580
I don't know.
Fucking trouble that,

2118
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:55,570
that son of a bitches major trouble.
So let me go back to where.

2119
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:58,140
So I,
uh,

2120
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:03,980
I do this radio spot and when they're
doing it at radio decide TB.

2121
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:07,880
When I do the radio spot,
they're filming me in my car at Radio

2122
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:10,740
one radio spot.
I'm wearing a wrestlemania tee shirt and

2123
01:40:10,741 --> 01:40:14,370
I know because I have this footage still
and I put it up on my motivational

2124
01:40:14,371 --> 01:40:18,900
Mondays for our very first one,
a power of power of what's possible.

2125
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:22,920
And then they fill me at my office right
now.

2126
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:27,780
Let me just digress the week before I'm
going around at night and I'm grabbing

2127
01:40:27,781 --> 01:40:28,600
the drawers,
you know,

2128
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:32,070
like the,
the money tours and I'm watching video

2129
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,080
that's upon girls.
Just wanna have fun.

2130
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:36,170
Remember that with city law?
Sure.

2131
01:40:36,350 --> 01:40:40,200
And it had captain Lou Albanna wanted,
who's like one of my favorite managers

2132
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:42,360
ever super character that a bunch of
movies.

2133
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:45,420
Lou was just super freaking fun to
watch.

2134
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:50,190
He's in that video and I'm picking up
the drawers and I'm not talking to

2135
01:40:50,191 --> 01:40:55,191
anybody but myself and I say
cap with the rubber bands and the beard.

2136
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,660
So I look up at that video and I go rock
and wrestling.

2137
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:06,220
I should've been a part of that.
And I walk into my office now,

2138
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:09,160
other bartenders going to come in and
count their drawers right now.

2139
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:12,010
And smoky comes into my head bartender
and he comes,

2140
01:41:12,011 --> 01:41:13,180
he goes,
page check.

2141
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:16,570
Because my real first name is paige
Joseph Falkenberg.

2142
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:21,590
And my dad said that that names ever
dry.

2143
01:41:21,610 --> 01:41:25,080
Anybody hates Falkenberg is get a tough
sell.

2144
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:28,510
Exactly.
It might Dallas page that makes sense.

2145
01:41:28,511 --> 01:41:29,344
Their work,
right?

2146
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:33,100
But my dad's page one and he said,
I'm freaking,

2147
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:34,660
you know,
your page two.

2148
01:41:34,661 --> 01:41:35,494
And I'm like,
no.

2149
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:37,840
As a little kid,
he said he didn't like that.

2150
01:41:37,841 --> 01:41:41,980
So Dallas cowboys was my theme that I
loved the most when I was little kid

2151
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:44,950
don't know because of the stars or
whatever and Landry and all that shit.

2152
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:49,630
And he ends up a nickname me,
dallas.

2153
01:41:49,631 --> 01:41:51,580
So I always loved that name.
So let's put them together.

2154
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:53,060
It's kind of crazy,
right?

2155
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:56,040
So I tried that as handsome.
So.

2156
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:59,110
So bottom line is smokey comes in the
back and he goes,

2157
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:01,110
page jake,
he goes up,

2158
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:03,610
what do you mean rock and wrestling?

2159
01:42:03,610 --> 01:42:04,990
You should've been a part of that.
And I said,

2160
01:42:04,991 --> 01:42:05,381
well,
you know,

2161
01:42:05,381 --> 01:42:06,910
I tried it when I was a kid.
He goes,

2162
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:09,160
you did,
what was your name?

2163
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,740
I said,
handsome Dallas page.

2164
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:13,120
And he went,
Oh,

2165
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:15,280
you forget about using that gimmick
anymore.

2166
01:42:15,281 --> 01:42:16,490
And everybody laughed,
you know,

2167
01:42:16,491 --> 01:42:18,820
and now we're drinking sat for hours,
right?

2168
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:24,100
So I can't get it out of my head.
Joe and I just start scribbling and I

2169
01:42:24,101 --> 01:42:26,890
write diamond Dallas page and I said,
you know,

2170
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,140
where'd you get the diamond?
I just figured my birthday,

2171
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:31,010
April.
And it just kind of float.

2172
01:42:31,090 --> 01:42:33,230
This is a diamond a month,
April's yeah,

2173
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:36,220
April fifth is a diamond.
And I,

2174
01:42:36,221 --> 01:42:38,860
um,
I love classy freddy blasting and I

2175
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:41,350
loved the way that name float classy,
Freddie blassie.

2176
01:42:41,351 --> 01:42:43,690
I thought Diamond Dallas page.
It kind of flows.

2177
01:42:43,691 --> 01:42:45,280
I go,
what about if my name was,

2178
01:42:45,281 --> 01:42:49,360
I'm too old to be a wrestler Knoxville
or try one was 22 or 21 slash 23 slash

2179
01:42:49,361 --> 01:42:50,194
22.

2180
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:53,300
And now I'm 31.
So Yang and you,

2181
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:54,640
we're going to be a manager or
something.

2182
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:56,200
And what are you mad at?
Her kimmy hearts.

2183
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:58,960
A manager.
I could be Diamond Dallas page,

2184
01:42:58,961 --> 01:43:00,250
Jimmy Hart,
you know,

2185
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:04,550
it's got the heart foundation.
I could have the diamond exchange rates

2186
01:43:04,590 --> 01:43:07,600
shot shot.
So now we're getting pretty fucked up

2187
01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:11,490
and it's.
So I say,

2188
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:13,331
I say,
you know,

2189
01:43:13,331 --> 01:43:14,980
um,
you know,

2190
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:19,090
there's not a lot of really good looking
women in wrestling today.

2191
01:43:19,091 --> 01:43:20,710
I go,
Miss Elizabeth's beautiful.

2192
01:43:20,711 --> 01:43:22,480
But she's girl next door.
Beautiful.

2193
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:26,950
What if I had a whole stable of ladies
and I called them diamond dolls and they

2194
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:28,990
were stripper hot.
It was like,

2195
01:43:28,991 --> 01:43:30,070
oh,
that'll be a stretch.

2196
01:43:30,071 --> 01:43:31,090
Wow.
Shot,

2197
01:43:31,091 --> 01:43:31,721
shot,
drink,

2198
01:43:31,721 --> 01:43:35,140
drink.
And so the end of the night comes around

2199
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:38,470
and I'm like,
Diamond Dallas page,

2200
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:41,230
diamond exchange,
that diamond dolls.

2201
01:43:41,231 --> 01:43:42,064
I go,
man,

2202
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:47,220
that's fucking be a double d bad.
And I went and I just made that up

2203
01:43:47,591 --> 01:43:47,700
there.

2204
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:51,950
I steal that somebody.
And I just wrote it down a week later.

2205
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:57,200
Here I am with the party news network
and they're interviewing me and at some

2206
01:43:57,201 --> 01:44:00,380
point they say,
so where does the voice come from?

2207
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:03,140
Our job.
There's not a pair of white sunglasses

2208
01:44:03,141 --> 01:44:05,330
there at the time.
I don't know if I do it,

2209
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:10,010
but they're sitting right there next to
that shit.

2210
01:44:10,550 --> 01:44:13,940
So I grab him when I put them on.
And let's say your sunglasses,

2211
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:16,060
sunglasses,
they'll wrap out.

2212
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:18,590
I mean they weren't there.
I don't know if I say out and if I go

2213
01:44:18,591 --> 01:44:21,320
into character,
but because I could put a mask on.

2214
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,240
Uh Huh.

2215
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:26,710
I go,
the boards comes from give me some

2216
01:44:26,711 --> 01:44:28,330
volume.
Give me some volume on this.

2217
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,660
Put you in a deep breathe.
It's light that now ladies,

2218
01:44:32,661 --> 01:44:34,970
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to the ladies on TV.

2219
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:39,660
He must be getting back to them and then
I'll get back to the over your data

2220
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,910
in this interview.
You get it was good.

2221
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:47,270
A little hot in here.
It would have program here like I was

2222
01:44:47,271 --> 01:44:49,040
saying,
because the ice man puts you in a deep

2223
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:50,310
freeze.
It's like that.

2224
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:51,500
Pay Attention.
Ms. Dot Bernstein.

2225
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:55,310
Oh my God.
This is fucking classic.

2226
01:44:55,311 --> 01:44:57,890
You got a motley crue tee shirt on with
no neck.

2227
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:00,880
Look at this guy.
Rock hard,

2228
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:05,920
Rick,
and then Jack Bernstein has his own show

2229
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:14,040
in Jersey on as a podcast or country
music,

2230
01:45:14,041 --> 01:45:16,020
but he's a bit.
It was a big job for a long time.

2231
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:20,090
Great pipes over.

2232
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:26,020
Peeling down the walls of my mind with
his bare hands.

2233
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:28,080
But diamonds,
don't you know,

2234
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:32,500
one of my mods.
Colab.

2235
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,080
We had to bring in cranes.
We had to bring in trade.

2236
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:41,170
We even brought in blame because we were
afraid at the bottom of that mind lay

2237
01:45:41,261 --> 01:45:43,820
this big,
big man.

2238
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:47,550
John.
Jack.

2239
01:45:47,551 --> 01:45:51,150
We all bring it today.
We're bringing out fucking classics.

2240
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:53,350
What years old.
This is the beginning of where we

2241
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:54,560

01:45:56,930 --> 01:46:01,930
The Diamond Dallas baton exchange,

2247
01:46:02,681 --> 01:46:05,200
all over the world.
They love to cuddle him.

2248
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:08,610
He is the Ted Ebay.
If you wouldn't mind taking off,

2249
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:09,880
take off that jacket,
that teddy bear.

2250
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:12,880
Show the fans what you got.
Show them what you got here.

2251
01:46:13,090 --> 01:46:18,090
Board

2252
01:46:18,730 --> 01:46:21,920
This ain't no normal midget wrestler.
The world.

2253
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,810
You know what I'm talking about?
Oh my God.

2254
01:46:24,811 --> 01:46:25,690
Awesome.
Russell there.

2255
01:46:26,230 --> 01:46:29,200
Dallas,
and those ladies are unbelievable.

2256
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:30,320
They can't

2257
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:35,841
listen.
Listen,

2258
01:46:35,841 --> 01:46:36,430

2259
01:46:36,430 --> 01:46:37,263
listen for Teddy,

2260
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:39,590
teddy bear.
Do you have anything to add to this?

2261
01:46:44,850 --> 01:46:47,670
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

2262
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:53,880
This is 1987.
Oh my God.

2263
01:46:53,881 --> 01:46:56,190
I'm fresh out of high school.
That's two years out of high school for

2264
01:46:56,191 --> 01:47:00,390
me.
So what happened was I do this promo

2265
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:03,570
where they got the shelf,
like we just went ahead of it.

2266
01:47:03,571 --> 01:47:07,620
Okay.
So where I'm doing the news network and

2267
01:47:07,621 --> 01:47:09,270
they say,
where does the voice come from?

2268
01:47:09,810 --> 01:47:12,330
I looked out and I always say,
just don't think it,

2269
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,010
ink it,
write it down.

2270
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:16,410
It's right in front of me.
This is your spot.

2271
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:20,100
I grabbed those sunglasses.
I put them on and I go,

2272
01:47:20,110 --> 01:47:22,340
the voice comes from Diamond Dallas page
data.

2273
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:25,290
I was born to be able to touch the rest
of it's big.

2274
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:26,870
It's bad.
It's an internet.

2275
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:30,420
Normal genes voice and I took them off
and I kept talking.

2276
01:47:31,290 --> 01:47:34,700
I radio jock who is a.
It was a great fighter.

2277
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:39,720
Name was smitty and Smitty sees this,
so this is like a week later,

2278
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:40,530
right?

2279
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:45,530
I get a phone call from the girl at the
front desk says on page on Thursday

2280
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:50,700
someone to call for Diamond Dallas page.
I pick up the phone and go,

2281
01:47:50,701 --> 01:47:53,120
fuck you smoky.
And I hang up the phone,

2282
01:47:53,121 --> 01:47:54,600
right,
because I think it's smoky ribbing me

2283
01:47:54,610 --> 01:47:56,280
right?
Calls back.

2284
01:47:56,281 --> 01:47:57,150
She goes,
it's not.

2285
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:59,340
Smokey is named Smith.
He's got a radio show.

2286
01:47:59,341 --> 01:48:02,040
He wants to talk to you.
I go,

2287
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:02,910
hello?
He's like,

2288
01:48:02,911 --> 01:48:04,530
yeah,
I want to bring you on the show.

2289
01:48:04,531 --> 01:48:07,350
He goes,
know I'm a boxer who has his own show

2290
01:48:07,351 --> 01:48:09,300
about boxing,
but I want to start doing wrestling.

2291
01:48:09,301 --> 01:48:10,140
I go,
he goes,

2292
01:48:10,141 --> 01:48:12,780
I want to have you on the show.
I go brow,

2293
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:16,740
I don't really do it.
I was just making that shit up,

2294
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:17,633
you know,
and he's like,

2295
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:21,120
who cares?
It's radio and I'm like,

2296
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:22,080
man,
I don't know.

2297
01:48:22,081 --> 01:48:23,840
He goes,
I'm going to have captain blue while

2298
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:25,560
banner worn.
Like,

2299
01:48:25,561 --> 01:48:29,290
what's the odds of that?
I'm going to have captain Lou Albano on

2300
01:48:29,291 --> 01:48:30,920
the show.
I want you to be my cohost.

2301
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:32,010
I go,
do I get the talk?

2302
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:33,690
The captain will.
He's like,

2303
01:48:33,691 --> 01:48:34,670
absolutely.
I go,

2304
01:48:34,671 --> 01:48:35,504
oh man.

2305
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:42,060
So I do that show when I do another one
with sergeant and he says to me,

2306
01:48:42,061 --> 01:48:42,930
he says,
you know,

2307
01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:46,290
you got to do something with this
Diamond Dallas page thing.

2308
01:48:46,291 --> 01:48:47,370
You're a natural.
I go,

2309
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:49,350
many do what?
I don't know what the fuck to do.

2310
01:48:49,351 --> 01:48:51,930
I mean it's just something in my head.
And he says,

2311
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:55,470
I got this friend of mine named Rob
[inaudible] who is a boxing promoter who

2312
01:48:55,471 --> 01:48:58,230
now is working for the awa up in
Minnesota.

2313
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:01,830
I'll give you his address,
send them a tape or something.

2314
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:07,520
So I think about it and I write those
storylines for those guys and then I

2315
01:49:08,131 --> 01:49:13,131
make that tape and I sent it to the Awa.
No bullshit.

2316
01:49:13,381 --> 01:49:15,630
Joe.
Two weeks later I get a phone call,

2317
01:49:16,730 --> 01:49:17,563
hey,
um,

2318
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:19,800
is this Diamond Dallas page?
And I'm like,

2319
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:20,700
uh,
yeah,

2320
01:49:21,810 --> 01:49:25,800
this is rob [inaudible] from the Awa.
We've seen your tape.

2321
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:30,060
We want to bring you and your boys and
for a tryout,

2322
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:32,640
he goes,
probably cut one question,

2323
01:49:32,641 --> 01:49:34,650
you know,
we've shown them tape around and

2324
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:36,570
everybody kind of liked your stick,
you know,

2325
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:37,920
it's fresh,
got energy.

2326
01:49:37,921 --> 01:49:40,170
Said,
but what's ever heard of you?

2327
01:49:40,171 --> 01:49:41,520
Where are you guys working?

2328
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:45,330
Well Rob,
we've got one problem.

2329
01:49:45,331 --> 01:49:46,950
I'm,
none of those guys can.

2330
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:49,443
He's like,
what?

2331
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:51,520
He goes,
why would you send us a tape?

2332
01:49:51,521 --> 01:49:53,110
I go,
it's like a secret society.

2333
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:56,740
Like no one could figure out how to
fucking get in so you know why they're

2334
01:49:56,741 --> 01:49:58,810
trading.
I could manage.

2335
01:49:58,811 --> 01:49:59,350
And I'm like,
God,

2336
01:49:59,350 --> 01:50:00,670
don't call us.
We'll call you.

2337
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:05,560
And two weeks later,
God just alignness for me at some for

2338
01:50:05,561 --> 01:50:09,820
some reason just to be where I am today.
But Paul Heyman,

2339
01:50:09,821 --> 01:50:11,320
who's one of the biggest stars,
as you know,

2340
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:14,680
a character on Bebee,
whl television was called Poli

2341
01:50:14,681 --> 01:50:19,681
dangerously at the time he left the aws,
went to the end two a which was going to

2342
01:50:22,301 --> 01:50:26,650
get bought by Ted Turner.
Let the huge spot open for a young guy

2343
01:50:26,651 --> 01:50:28,270
that could talk.
They brought me in.

2344
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:32,080
All those clothes you saw me in.
I was wearing that shit in Fort Myers,

2345
01:50:32,081 --> 01:50:32,914
Florida.

2346
01:50:33,490 --> 01:50:35,080
And I said to my buddy,
curt church,

2347
01:50:35,081 --> 01:50:39,580
who was my head bouncer at a time I the
floor and I and when this was starting

2348
01:50:39,581 --> 01:50:40,391
to happen,
and I go,

2349
01:50:40,391 --> 01:50:42,610
dude,
can you imagine if I ever have a reason

2350
01:50:42,611 --> 01:50:47,611
to dress like this?
And if anything I got way more tapered

2351
01:50:48,371 --> 01:50:52,520
down.
I wasn't living the gimmick but a bear.

2352
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:55,560
That was the beginning of everything.
And then dusty Rhodes had come into

2353
01:50:55,570 --> 01:50:57,540
Florida for Florida championship
wrestling.

2354
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:02,530
Dusty took me under his wing man and he
gave me every break that ever meant

2355
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:07,330
anything to my career early on.
That's why was so important for me to be

2356
01:51:07,331 --> 01:51:11,440
there for cody because I get choked up
just thinking about it without dusty

2357
01:51:11,441 --> 01:51:16,441
Rhodes original Diamond Dallas page.
He gave me every break I ever had and

2358
01:51:16,451 --> 01:51:21,451
for me to watch his son do what they did
last weekend.

2359
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:23,920
Do you remember your first match?

2360
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:27,850
My first,
my first match a was a tag match,

2361
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,460
so I'm managing now.
Okay.

2362
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:34,560
Three and a half years.
And then I finally get the call because

2363
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:38,980
dusty who went to wwe and he did just
polka dotted gimmick.

2364
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:43,320
Willem,
he came back to run the to WCW and now

2365
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:46,920
he's Nwa world champion.
He's one of the smartest guys ever in

2366
01:51:46,921 --> 01:51:48,730
our business.
And um,

2367
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:52,900
I developed a relationship that was
super tight with him when we were in

2368
01:51:52,901 --> 01:51:55,480
Florida,
but it was his wife Michelle,

2369
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:59,140
who really kept it going when he wasn't.
Because when I'd call up just to check

2370
01:51:59,141 --> 01:52:01,300
in with dusty,
once in a while she'd say,

2371
01:52:01,301 --> 01:52:04,180
don't worry Dallas dusty.
We'll call you back.

2372
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:07,660
And knowing how bad he is at calling
someone back.

2373
01:52:08,410 --> 01:52:11,800
I know that that's why I think Michelle
and my whole fame speech,

2374
01:52:11,801 --> 01:52:15,340
because I know without her,
I don't know if it ever would have kept

2375
01:52:15,341 --> 01:52:17,830
going the way it today,
but dusty,

2376
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:20,770
you know,
he brought me in and I managed the

2377
01:52:20,771 --> 01:52:23,610
freebirds Michael ps Hayes and Jimmy Gam
Garland,

2378
01:52:23,611 --> 01:52:25,540
which was such an education,
such a good time.

2379
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:29,680
Michael's still one of my best friends
today and I hope Scott Hall,

2380
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:35,070
who was big Scott Hall come in,
changed his entire look from blonde hair

2381
01:52:35,411 --> 01:52:39,490
and a big role as mustache.
Adam dye his hair jet black and give

2382
01:52:39,491 --> 01:52:44,491
them this brush cut beard that like
nobody had the 5:00 shadow and no one

2383
01:52:44,861 --> 01:52:47,960
knew the fuck he was and I brought them
in.

2384
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:51,500
And what is happening as you see all the
crazy clothes I wore.

2385
01:52:52,370 --> 01:52:55,870
Well,
five months in magnum ta who's get dusty

2386
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:57,710
righthand man comes up to me and he's
like,

2387
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:01,070
listen,
we're going to keep you at the color

2388
01:53:01,071 --> 01:53:03,590
commentator spock's.
I'm also doing color commentating with

2389
01:53:03,591 --> 01:53:05,450
our pitch off who would later run the
company.

2390
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:07,520
Um,
and he said,

2391
01:53:07,521 --> 01:53:09,110
um,
he said,

2392
01:53:09,111 --> 01:53:12,180
we can't let you manage anymore.
Like what?

2393
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:13,820
What I do wrong?
He goes,

2394
01:53:13,821 --> 01:53:16,310
it's not,
it's not anything you're doing wrong,

2395
01:53:16,311 --> 01:53:16,550
bro.

2396
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:17,383
He goes,
he goes,

2397
01:53:18,140 --> 01:53:22,520
it is with the hair and the wrap and the
dowels and those crazy clothes.

2398
01:53:22,521 --> 01:53:24,230
He goes,
you're taking too much attention away

2399
01:53:24,231 --> 01:53:26,990
from the boys and they're the ones who
draw the money.

2400
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:28,970
And I was like,
so fuck.

2401
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:33,080
Are you telling me magnum,
that I'm too over the top or wrestling?

2402
01:53:34,910 --> 01:53:36,740
And he goes,
as a manager Kinda.

2403
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:38,570
He said,
but you know,

2404
01:53:38,571 --> 01:53:41,120
what we should have done is put you in a
pair of tights and boots and see if you

2405
01:53:41,121 --> 01:53:44,180
could do this shit.
I had seven months left on my contract,

2406
01:53:44,181 --> 01:53:45,560
Bro.
I said,

2407
01:53:45,561 --> 01:53:48,110
fuck this.
I never got in this business to be a

2408
01:53:48,111 --> 01:53:50,870
manager.
I wanted to live the dream.

2409
01:53:51,290 --> 01:53:55,970
Well I'm going to do it.
And I went down there and they beat the

2410
01:53:55,971 --> 01:53:57,230
fuck out of me.
Now.

2411
01:53:57,231 --> 01:53:59,420
Did they teach you how to do it first?

2412
01:53:59,440 --> 01:53:59,850
No,
they.

2413
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:02,930
What they do is they blow you up.
Mrs Was not done.

2414
01:54:03,060 --> 01:54:07,760
The nxts is different.
I'm like down there performance center,

2415
01:54:07,761 --> 01:54:12,200
but the original power plant,
my one of my mentors,

2416
01:54:12,201 --> 01:54:17,000
a guy named Jody Hamilton who was the
assassin and he really taught me a lot

2417
01:54:17,001 --> 01:54:20,660
and so did this Guy Sarge,
but in the beginning they want to run

2418
01:54:20,661 --> 01:54:23,060
you off so they want to see if you'll
quit.

2419
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:23,961
Oh,
absolutely.

2420
01:54:23,961 --> 01:54:27,230
It's just get you to quit.
It's a different level of seal training,

2421
01:54:27,590 --> 01:54:32,590
like you're going to do 50,
50 Hindu squats where you're asked to,

2422
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:38,360
you know a and up again,
and then you can do 10 pushups and then

2423
01:54:38,361 --> 01:54:41,300
you're going to do $50 and then 10 and
50 and 10.

2424
01:54:41,330 --> 01:54:43,820
By the time you get to that third 50
your life,

2425
01:54:43,821 --> 01:54:47,150
you're not in shape.
You're screwed because we're going to

2426
01:54:47,151 --> 01:54:48,430
500.
Yeah.

2427
01:54:48,450 --> 01:54:50,780
Fit Hindu squats are a big thing amongst
wrestlers,

2428
01:54:50,781 --> 01:54:51,200
right?
Yep.

2429
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:54,100
It's a great way to get in shape.
It's really wears on your knees and

2430
01:54:54,101 --> 01:54:55,120
boom,
boom foot.

2431
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:57,040
It's really good for you.
Nice and non.

2432
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:57,883
No,
no,

2433
01:54:58,410 --> 01:55:00,890
not free.
If you've got bad and you're wondering

2434
01:55:00,891 --> 01:55:03,470
where to go,
you got great knees.

2435
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:05,180
Inputs.
It's like anything.

2436
01:55:05,181 --> 01:55:07,340
There's only so many bumps.
You're allowed life.

2437
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:09,910
The MS was on fear factor back in the
day.

2438
01:55:10,630 --> 01:55:12,910
To this day,
I say he's the fittest guy that was ever

2439
01:55:12,911 --> 01:55:15,580
on the show.
That fucking kid is a stud.

2440
01:55:15,581 --> 01:55:19,930
He is a stud.
He did this stunt in cold water where

2441
01:55:19,931 --> 01:55:23,410
you had a dive into this cold water,
hold your breath in and complete this

2442
01:55:23,411 --> 01:55:25,720
stunt,
and he was in it for more than two

2443
01:55:25,721 --> 01:55:28,110
minutes holding his breath and cold
water enough,

2444
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:30,130
you know,
anything about cold water that is

2445
01:55:30,131 --> 01:55:34,050
unbelievably impressive.
Plus very grueling physical activity.

2446
01:55:34,051 --> 01:55:36,760
It's not.
He was just in cold water holding his

2447
01:55:36,761 --> 01:55:39,190
breath for two minutes,
which is impressive enough as it is,

2448
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:43,710
but he was swimming around and pulling
off like he blew everybody out of the

2449
01:55:43,711 --> 01:55:44,280
water

2450
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:46,080
and he told me he did a shitload of
those.

2451
01:55:46,081 --> 01:55:49,110
He was doing $500 a day.
Five hundred Hindu squad kid,

2452
01:55:49,210 --> 01:55:51,750
no kid,
and that's why it was that guy shape.

2453
01:55:51,751 --> 01:55:53,880
Let me give you a super nice guy too.
Tremendous.

2454
01:55:53,881 --> 01:55:57,690
I love them is I think he's going to be
a huge superstar.

2455
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:59,430
He's already a huge superstar in
wrestling,

2456
01:55:59,431 --> 01:56:03,480
but I think he's going to be huge
superstar in the acting transcend.

2457
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:05,340
So let me tell you the first time I meet
him.

2458
01:56:06,030 --> 01:56:08,040
I'm here in La.
I'm living in Playa Vista.

2459
01:56:08,041 --> 01:56:09,840
Before that,
all that shit blew up there.

2460
01:56:09,841 --> 01:56:10,710
Right.
I'm living there.

2461
01:56:10,711 --> 01:56:11,544
It's night.
Yeah.

2462
01:56:11,740 --> 01:56:14,370
I want to say it's 2004 because I'm
gonna I,

2463
01:56:14,450 --> 01:56:18,630
I wrestled until I was 46.
Then I took off two and a half years.

2464
01:56:18,631 --> 01:56:20,610
Came here,
did the whole acting thing and put my

2465
01:56:20,611 --> 01:56:24,930
dues and put the work in.
Now I want to go back and I want to show

2466
01:56:24,931 --> 01:56:28,530
people what I can do with my ddpy
program at 49,

2467
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:33,490
so I call up a buddy of mine named Rick
bassman and he's got the upw at the time

2468
01:56:33,491 --> 01:56:35,140
when he's got the own area,
kind of like,

2469
01:56:35,330 --> 01:56:37,980
like the power plant was and then kids
are training their.

2470
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:39,540
Whenever I said,
do me a favor,

2471
01:56:39,541 --> 01:56:42,440
send me over one of your boys and let
him a combine.

2472
01:56:42,460 --> 01:56:45,030
Get me and you know,
I'll do what I want to do and then I'll

2473
01:56:45,031 --> 01:56:49,170
help work with him.
A little bit and so he sends me Mike,

2474
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:54,070
the Miz and just the sweetest kid and
we,

2475
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:56,850
we have a great talk on the way over
there and you know,

2476
01:56:56,851 --> 01:56:59,010
I get,
I get done doing all my shit,

2477
01:56:59,370 --> 01:57:00,360
you know,
and then I said,

2478
01:57:00,361 --> 01:57:01,260
okay,
what do you want learn?

2479
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:02,880
He's like,
you're gonna work with me.

2480
01:57:02,881 --> 01:57:03,481
I'm like,
hell yeah,

2481
01:57:03,481 --> 01:57:05,110
I want to work with you.
Got great attitude,

2482
01:57:05,111 --> 01:57:06,810
dude,
of course going to work with you.

2483
01:57:07,110 --> 01:57:11,670
And we worked and now he's taking me
home and he tells me about how he's was

2484
01:57:11,671 --> 01:57:14,430
a real world.
He's like the original real world guy.

2485
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:15,720
So he's like,
I said,

2486
01:57:15,721 --> 01:57:17,550
man,
you've got that piece.

2487
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:19,320
Like people already know you.
That's,

2488
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:21,480
that's,
that's really worth something.

2489
01:57:21,481 --> 01:57:24,300
It will really come back to help you
later as you're going through this.

2490
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:27,300
So we get all the way back to my place
and I'm like,

2491
01:57:27,301 --> 01:57:28,800
you want to come in for a beer?
He's like,

2492
01:57:28,830 --> 01:57:29,663
oh,
absolutely.

2493
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:32,310
So he comes in and who's on the porch?
But stone cold.

2494
01:57:32,311 --> 01:57:35,370
Steve Austin,
who I live with at a time and Kevin Nash

2495
01:57:35,371 --> 01:57:37,280
are there.
So he's like in,

2496
01:57:37,370 --> 01:57:38,970
Whoa,
what the fuck,

2497
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:43,720
I was just a Wrestlemania a full two
years ago and you know,

2498
01:57:44,210 --> 01:57:48,120
when I was inducted in the hall of fame
and Ms Dot was back doing one of his

2499
01:57:48,121 --> 01:57:49,170
things.
Now he's got the,

2500
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:52,500
the reality show with his wife,
which is super funny,

2501
01:57:52,710 --> 01:57:57,120
and there's times where I'm like,
this is really real because your reality

2502
01:57:57,121 --> 01:57:59,220
show,
there's no such thing as real life in

2503
01:57:59,221 --> 01:58:02,010
reality show shit,
but there's a lot of their stuff you

2504
01:58:02,011 --> 01:58:05,340
could tell that they're like shooting on
because they want the real,

2505
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:06,420
uh,
the real deal.

2506
01:58:06,810 --> 01:58:09,810
But he told that story like he was
backstage,

2507
01:58:09,811 --> 01:58:12,030
but it's one of his suits on and his
wife there he goes,

2508
01:58:12,031 --> 01:58:14,070
Whoa,
I come here and database Kabir let,

2509
01:58:14,290 --> 01:58:16,290
let's talk about the story when we first
met.

2510
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:21,620
And I just knew that that kid,
like he's hit a couple of roadblocks

2511
01:58:21,631 --> 01:58:23,700
along the way that he could,
he could have quit.

2512
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:25,560
He could've walked away from it.
He could have not.

2513
01:58:25,710 --> 01:58:28,650
But he had such a belief in himself.
I always tell people,

2514
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:33,860
never underestimate the power you give
yourself by believing in you.

2515
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:38,090
And that's who the MS is and I think
he's going to be a huge.

2516
01:58:38,490 --> 01:58:42,760
I love the fact we get a of different
slat now because of the man.

2517
01:58:42,970 --> 01:58:47,410
The Rock,
the biggest star in the world is one of

2518
01:58:47,411 --> 01:58:49,600
us.
And did you see blockers would Sina?

2519
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:51,070
No.
Oh Dude,

2520
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:51,933
watch it.

2521
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:56,170
It's one of the funniest movies I've
ever seen and I was flying home.

2522
01:58:56,171 --> 01:58:57,820
I'm telling my wife,
you got to watch this movie.

2523
01:58:57,821 --> 01:59:00,670
It's hysterical.
She's sitting next to me and I'm not

2524
01:59:00,671 --> 01:59:02,560
even walk.
I can't hear it because I've already

2525
01:59:02,561 --> 01:59:04,960
seen it.
She's laughing so hard,

2526
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:08,650
but I'm laughing because I'm watching it
and I know what they're saying or an

2527
01:59:08,651 --> 01:59:11,500
idea of it.
But when you got visual comedy,

2528
01:59:11,501 --> 01:59:15,970
which you know,
when you don't hear the words and you're

2529
01:59:15,971 --> 01:59:18,460
watching like buster Keaton and you're
laughing,

2530
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:23,140
that's really good shit.
And it's super funny and seen it killed

2531
01:59:23,141 --> 01:59:24,370
it.
So you know,

2532
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:26,410
he's,
he's super alias actor now.

2533
01:59:26,411 --> 01:59:29,350
He just did Ferdinand moving him.
I mean he's on fire.

2534
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:30,340
I,
I,

2535
01:59:30,430 --> 01:59:34,050
last time I saw him at the show,
I just pulled them over for a second.

2536
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:36,160
I just because I don't really know him
that well,

2537
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:37,660
but I wanted to know.

2538
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:42,780
I wanted him to know that I was so proud
of him not for what he's done is an

2539
01:59:42,911 --> 01:59:45,430
actor,
even though I'm super proud of him on

2540
01:59:45,431 --> 01:59:47,710
that level,
but how he carried the company on his

2541
01:59:47,711 --> 01:59:52,711
back for over a decade and still did so
much work for charity mean it was mind

2542
01:59:53,191 --> 01:59:56,260
boggling.
Like no one has done more along that

2543
01:59:56,261 --> 02:00:00,220
whole make a wish thing than Ciena has.
But when I saw.

2544
02:00:00,221 --> 02:00:02,770
Did you see him when he hosted the sps?
No,

2545
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:05,140
dude,
you're a comedian.

2546
02:00:05,170 --> 02:00:10,170
You know how hard that shit is.
He is not extended up comedian,

2547
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:14,680
but he was frigging amazing what he's
been acting for so long now.

2548
02:00:14,681 --> 02:00:17,140
It's so loose and you know,
this is the thing about being behind the

2549
02:00:17,141 --> 02:00:21,040
mic on the wwe as well.
Just being able to do that in front of

2550
02:00:21,041 --> 02:00:23,040
all those apps that.
Absolutely.

2551
02:00:23,041 --> 02:00:25,990
I'd say that's its own level of like
sometime 20 minute promos are doing.

2552
02:00:26,230 --> 02:00:29,800
The Rock confuses me in like how much
energy is.

2553
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:32,740
I don't know how the fuck he can do all
the things he does.

2554
02:00:32,830 --> 02:00:34,660
Yeah.
He's always doing something like,

2555
02:00:34,690 --> 02:00:37,810
I go to his instagram page all the time,
like a lazy.

2556
02:00:40,280 --> 02:00:41,560
He's.
He flies into China.

2557
02:00:41,561 --> 02:00:43,090
It's four in the morning.
He's lifting weights.

2558
02:00:43,091 --> 02:00:47,380
Like what the fuck man?
The hardest word in cat I have ever seen

2559
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:50,730
this old way of doing something.
Yeah,

2560
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:53,230
I mean he's just sandwiches everything
together.

2561
02:00:53,231 --> 02:00:55,500
I don't know how the fuck he does it.
I'll tell you,

2562
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:59,020
Jericho is.
I put like guys like who have the most

2563
02:00:59,021 --> 02:01:04,021
insane work ethic right now?
Rock is way past everybody who's past.

2564
02:01:04,091 --> 02:01:05,860
Anyone I've ever seen that.
Me Too.

2565
02:01:05,861 --> 02:01:08,000
And,
and I'll just occasionally put,

2566
02:01:08,070 --> 02:01:09,030
you know,
just a tweet out,

2567
02:01:09,031 --> 02:01:09,870
just says,
hey dude,

2568
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:12,910
keep up the great work.
He's one of those guys where I go,

2569
02:01:12,911 --> 02:01:16,090
how long can a human,
how long can the human body.

2570
02:01:16,210 --> 02:01:17,500
I'm like going like this because you
know,

2571
02:01:17,501 --> 02:01:19,410
he's only sleeping four hours a night.
He's got to.

2572
02:01:19,411 --> 02:01:20,560
Yeah.
I think he's kind of like my buddy

2573
02:01:20,561 --> 02:01:20,951
Steve.
You,

2574
02:01:20,951 --> 02:01:22,510
they don't need to sleep.
They just keep going.

2575
02:01:22,511 --> 02:01:24,430
Jericho's the same way.
Jericho,

2576
02:01:24,580 --> 02:01:27,070
when he's not wrestling,
he's singing when he's not doing that,

2577
02:01:27,071 --> 02:01:28,540
he's doing his podcast so he's not doing
that.

2578
02:01:28,541 --> 02:01:30,100
He's doing this or he's doing that or
we're doing this,

2579
02:01:30,101 --> 02:01:35,101
we're doing that and like he flew in,
they frigging private jet him into the

2580
02:01:35,801 --> 02:01:39,110
Olin deal and I didn't even know.
I don't like to know.

2581
02:01:39,111 --> 02:01:40,220
I want to be surprised

2582
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:42,440
and they shot this angle with Kenny
Omega,

2583
02:01:42,441 --> 02:01:46,880
who's one of the premier superstars that
our business right now,

2584
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:52,270
and they did him in Jericho at 47,
sold out the Tokyo dome.

2585
02:01:52,731 --> 02:01:56,600
Forty 7,000 people in January.
His match,

2586
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:59,000
these wrestled for Dan Churches.
Everything.

2587
02:01:59,001 --> 02:02:02,270
We're 48 minutes.
They wrestled for 37 minutes.

2588
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:04,700
He's 47.
Well,

2589
02:02:04,701 --> 02:02:07,770
he jumped on a plane while he's touring.
They flew him in.

2590
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:09,950
You put a mask on,
you thought it was one guy.

2591
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:15,080
He pulls the mask off.
Vettery drops Omega and bought a boom.

2592
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:18,980
It's Jericho.
The place goes bat shit crazy.

2593
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:21,200
He gets out,
grabs his deal,

2594
02:02:21,230 --> 02:02:24,140
hopped on a plane and flies were
supposed to play at 12:00 that night.

2595
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:27,770
That's Jericho.
And the other guys Patista.

2596
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:31,040
So Battista Yo.
Between a galaxy,

2597
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:32,900
right?
I mean the,

2598
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:37,930
here's four guys that are like red hot
as actors and they're all the boys.

2599
02:02:38,691 --> 02:02:41,180
He's fantastic and Guardians and oh my
God,

2600
02:02:41,181 --> 02:02:44,960
he's so good at being self deprecating
Dorky.

2601
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:50,060
I mean he plays like a goof so well and
he's such a cool dude.

2602
02:02:50,061 --> 02:02:51,620
Man.
Tony was here right now.

2603
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:54,800
He would be [inaudible] and his pants.
He really wouldn't be able to hold it

2604
02:02:54,801 --> 02:02:57,240
together.
Turn to that.

2605
02:02:58,250 --> 02:03:01,910
Now what's.
What's interesting is that this group,

2606
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:05,270
I mean Hulk Hogan was probably one of
the first big guys that transcend into

2607
02:03:05,271 --> 02:03:06,050
moodle.
Yes,

2608
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:08,360
yes.
But he got turned off by Hollywood.

2609
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:10,900
He had apparently it got a couple of
Dick robbers.

2610
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:13,100
I don't know,
that's a real story,

2611
02:03:13,190 --> 02:03:15,740
but I'll tell you what he said,
of all the guys that I know,

2612
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:20,840
like I'm super supportive whole because
he was super supportive of me too.

2613
02:03:21,321 --> 02:03:22,670
Great Guy.
Oh Man.

2614
02:03:22,700 --> 02:03:23,251
You know,
and,

2615
02:03:23,251 --> 02:03:28,190
and he right now he's doing.
He finally got back and they finally

2616
02:03:28,191 --> 02:03:31,250
brought them back in ww,
which I was super excited about because

2617
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:33,830
to me going into the whole thing without
hope being in there,

2618
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:35,960
just kind of like,
Whoa,

2619
02:03:35,980 --> 02:03:39,980
video of me interviewing Hulk Hogan for
Spike TV.

2620
02:03:40,130 --> 02:03:43,730
I got a chance to interview him for
Spike TV back in the day when he was a

2621
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:45,770
spike TV.
Went into the wrestling business.

2622
02:03:45,790 --> 02:03:46,510
Sure,
sure,

2623
02:03:46,510 --> 02:03:47,343
sure,
sure.

2624
02:03:47,390 --> 02:03:50,030
I hope that I helped them do that
because I was one of the names that

2625
02:03:50,031 --> 02:03:50,451
brought.
Yeah,

2626
02:03:50,451 --> 02:03:52,340
that's what I was wrestling.
So for me as a kid,

2627
02:03:52,341 --> 02:03:54,380
I mean I was a giant fan of Jimmy
superfly,

2628
02:03:54,381 --> 02:03:57,500
snuck a Bob Backlund,
although when I was in high school and

2629
02:03:57,510 --> 02:04:01,880
early eighties and Hulk Hogan.
So for me to get a chance to interview

2630
02:04:01,970 --> 02:04:05,540
Hulk Hogan,
it was this one of the greatest

2631
02:04:05,541 --> 02:04:06,650
professional wrestlers

2632
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:09,490
all time.
Sports and entertainment,

2633
02:04:09,491 --> 02:04:12,600
huge personality.
The one and only Hulk Hogan.

2634
02:04:12,610 --> 02:04:15,130
We share a brother,
you know,

2635
02:04:15,131 --> 02:04:20,131
to be here with Joe Mania.
It doesn't get any better than this

2636
02:04:20,441 --> 02:04:22,600
brother.
These guys are going to war out here.

2637
02:04:22,690 --> 02:04:26,920
It's unbelievable that you've made as an
mma fights before you a UFC fan.

2638
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:28,210
I'm a huge fan.
My brother.

2639
02:04:29,230 --> 02:04:34,230
Now I understand that you have recently
announced a partnership with TNA

2640
02:04:35,081 --> 02:04:37,320
wrestling and it's president Dixie
Carter,

2641
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:39,510
and you're going to be moving to spike
TV.

2642
02:04:39,630 --> 02:04:42,450
We're going to see some Hulkamania on
Spike TV.

2643
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:43,940
Tell us more about that.
Well,

2644
02:04:43,941 --> 02:04:47,940

energy and our partners with spike.

2645
02:04:48,140 --> 02:04:51,450

2646
02:04:51,451 --> 02:04:56,010

fourth to get a impact.

2647
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:58,710
We're going wide open.
We're going to head on head.

2648
02:04:58,860 --> 02:05:03,150
We're going to battle wwe Monday night
of January,

2649
02:05:03,151 --> 02:05:04,800
Fourth Hulk Hogan and TNA.

2650
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:07,650
We're coming after everybody burst out
for everybody's.

2651
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:10,590
Now I understand that you have you
recently released a book,

2652
02:05:10,830 --> 02:05:13,200
if you've done a wrestling tour in
Australia,

2653
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:16,800
when are we going to see Hulk Hogan
Wrestle in Tna?

2654
02:05:17,130 --> 02:05:17,940
Well,
brother,

2655
02:05:17,940 --> 02:05:19,430
I'm going January.
Fourth luck.

2656
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:22,320
I said Monday night we're going to war.
TNA impacts,

2657
02:05:22,530 --> 02:05:25,380
but you'd never know.
I'm going over there to take over.

2658
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:29,130
The maniacs are coming,
all the TNA star's going to be there and

2659
02:05:29,131 --> 02:05:33,120
you never know when the old man with a
yellow boots might just step in that

2660
02:05:33,121 --> 02:05:35,670
ring.
Brother Hulk Hogan is coming back.

2661
02:05:35,671 --> 02:05:39,090
Lazy Gentlemen,
CCNA wrestling live on spike TV.

2662
02:05:39,230 --> 02:05:42,060
Hugs here for the fights.
You know you want to watch them on TV.

2663
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:44,520
Watch.
You're going to do brother in the UFC

2664
02:05:44,670 --> 02:05:47,280
runs wild on you.
What are you going to do?

2665
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:49,620
That's the good question.
Thank you very much.

2666
02:05:50,770 --> 02:05:55,770
Would spot brother.
I was so happy you ever met Jean

2667
02:05:58,080 --> 02:05:59,000
Oakland.
Oh Man.

2668
02:05:59,020 --> 02:06:02,260
What did they skies on the planet,
but the whole coming when I got to do

2669
02:06:02,261 --> 02:06:07,261
much stuff with him because we not only
did the malone stuff mean morale.

2670
02:06:07,550 --> 02:06:10,240
I mean my wound against Rodman and
Hogan,

2671
02:06:10,540 --> 02:06:14,770
but the next month they come in and
because we shot that angle on the

2672
02:06:14,771 --> 02:06:18,550
tonight show and the next month they go
in,

2673
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:22,270
Hogan ambitious off and they runj off
the set.

2674
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:26,740
I come in from the wings,
not on his ass and it's me and Jay Leno

2675
02:06:27,050 --> 02:06:29,950
gets
bitch off.

2676
02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:36,060
Flip them over.
Look at.

2677
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:37,630
Hold on,
my God,

2678
02:06:37,631 --> 02:06:39,380
that is hilarious.
Oh,

2679
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:42,820
that is so funny.
Jay Leno was holding the dog down and he

2680
02:06:42,821 --> 02:06:47,590
grabs his hair is crazy.
This is so ridiculous.

2681
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:48,640
Oh God.
It was,

2682
02:06:49,140 --> 02:06:50,240
you know,
it was so much fun.

2683
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:53,200
I'll tell you,
you know another guy,

2684
02:06:53,230 --> 02:06:55,810
I mean,
he came and worked out with us and he

2685
02:06:55,811 --> 02:06:57,850
didn't,
didn't spend as much time like malone

2686
02:06:58,030 --> 02:07:02,280
because malone was like a super athlete,
but he works out at all now.

2687
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:05,230
Just turns wrenches,
gotta learn you gotTa.

2688
02:07:05,231 --> 02:07:07,930
Learn how to move around a little bit
and know we just worked around in,

2689
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:10,720
in hope was never that guy to lay stuff
out.

2690
02:07:10,721 --> 02:07:12,490
Like today,
a lot of this stuff is laid out,

2691
02:07:12,550 --> 02:07:14,170
you know,
back then it was like you called as you

2692
02:07:14,171 --> 02:07:16,960
go and,
and so I was a guy who actually did

2693
02:07:16,961 --> 02:07:18,520
that.
I could lay everything out and that's

2694
02:07:18,550 --> 02:07:21,880
how I liked to know where we're going
and I'm still going to talk you the

2695
02:07:21,881 --> 02:07:23,290
whole time,
you know,

2696
02:07:23,291 --> 02:07:25,950
but you know,
bottom line is a Yo jake,

2697
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:29,830
just working them through it and it was
a lot of fun when Hulk Hogan was in

2698
02:07:29,831 --> 02:07:31,270
rocky three.
I mean,

2699
02:07:31,271 --> 02:07:33,290
that was,
you was fucking fantastic.

2700
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:36,040
And then you also get to see God damn

2701
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:36,873
big.
He is.

2702
02:07:37,990 --> 02:07:41,020
Salon is go,
whoa.

2703
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:43,570
When he picked sly up by his neck and
you're like,

2704
02:07:43,571 --> 02:07:45,770
Holy Shit.
And then you know,

2705
02:07:45,790 --> 02:07:47,450
when they go through the whole thing,
when afterwards,

2706
02:07:47,470 --> 02:07:49,870
you know,
hoke is like smiling and laughing with

2707
02:07:49,871 --> 02:07:51,700
them and still only like,
oh good.

2708
02:07:51,701 --> 02:07:52,710
You know,
rocky was like,

2709
02:07:52,711 --> 02:07:53,544
oh,
all right,

2710
02:07:53,810 --> 02:07:57,000
like a little rough out.
That's what it is,

2711
02:07:57,010 --> 02:07:59,440
brother.
One of the greatest moments of great

2712
02:07:59,441 --> 02:08:01,080
moment in film.
So awesome.

2713
02:08:01,081 --> 02:08:04,630
I mean it was said that that was a big
moment in film too for a lot of people

2714
02:08:04,631 --> 02:08:08,450
that thought like pro wrestling is fake,
right?

2715
02:08:08,470 --> 02:08:09,303
It's like,
well,

2716
02:08:09,330 --> 02:08:11,050
ain't nothing fake about that.
I mean,

2717
02:08:11,051 --> 02:08:13,250
it's entertainment,
but if you don't think that's

2718
02:08:13,290 --> 02:08:16,870
[inaudible] difficult to do,
like look at the size difference.

2719
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:19,420
Jesus,
million bucks,

2720
02:08:19,421 --> 02:08:20,980
they're dead.
It looked fantastic.

2721
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:27,970
He was just super good to me and what he
picks him up over his head.

2722
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:31,660
Is there a video in this?
See if you can find video of it because

2723
02:08:31,661 --> 02:08:34,690
when Paul is going crazy and he's having
a heart attack or I love that.

2724
02:08:34,930 --> 02:08:37,170
Oh my God,
that was a great fucking scene.

2725
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:39,820
You know what I love about slide?
He's the perfect example.

2726
02:08:39,821 --> 02:08:41,980
Everybody counted them out and he's
fucking stronger.

2727
02:08:41,981 --> 02:08:42,990
Never again.
You know?

2728
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:44,121
He's like,
Yo,

2729
02:08:44,121 --> 02:08:47,360
we're going to move around a little bit.
Come on to hit you a little bit,

2730
02:08:47,361 --> 02:08:52,361
a little bit with this
little hole mania music.

2731
02:08:53,970 --> 02:08:57,490
They're just fucking.
That was snug.

2732
02:08:59,690 --> 02:09:01,690
Stallone was so slim and trim back
though,

2733
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:03,790
right?
It's kind of hilarious that he was

2734
02:09:03,791 --> 02:09:06,970
playing a heavyweight champion because
he's not a big guy.

2735
02:09:07,330 --> 02:09:10,900
He really is more like a middleweight,
but Hogan was.

2736
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:14,140
I mean he wouldn't even be able to back
in these days.

2737
02:09:14,141 --> 02:09:18,340
Wouldn't you be able to make the UFC?
Is Weight limit UFC as a 265 pound

2738
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:20,710
cutoff for whatever reason?
Really?

2739
02:09:20,740 --> 02:09:21,371
Yeah.
There's A.

2740
02:09:21,371 --> 02:09:23,470
There's no super heavyweight division
in.

2741
02:09:23,471 --> 02:09:24,500
MMM.
Yeah.

2742
02:09:24,510 --> 02:09:26,620
There.
There was a super heavyweight division.

2743
02:09:26,621 --> 02:09:29,020
It's possible,
but the UFC is never implemented it,

2744
02:09:29,140 --> 02:09:32,110
so it's been sanctioned.
There's a 265 and above,

2745
02:09:32,380 --> 02:09:37,380
but the UFC heavyweight division has a
cutoff and the bunch of guys have had to

2746
02:09:37,631 --> 02:09:39,310
cut weight.
Brock's a big example.

2747
02:09:39,790 --> 02:09:43,080
Brock had to cut weight to make to 65,
Francis and gone.

2748
02:09:43,081 --> 02:09:43,830
Oh Tim.
Silvia.

2749
02:09:43,830 --> 02:09:45,610
Few guys have had to actually cut.
Wait,

2750
02:09:45,670 --> 02:09:48,120
Mark Hunt,
cut weight to make to 65 work.

2751
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:51,280
Mark's about walking around in tank
five,

2752
02:09:51,281 --> 02:09:54,000
10 to 90.
Just bad.

2753
02:09:54,250 --> 02:09:57,460
Bad.
He's a bad man mark on.

2754
02:09:58,940 --> 02:10:00,820
But I love about sly.
Like you know,

2755
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:02,830
you go back to it.
A lot of people don't know that story.

2756
02:10:02,831 --> 02:10:06,070
I'm sure you do.
You know how he wrote that script or

2757
02:10:06,071 --> 02:10:11,071
rocking would not sell it and you get
all 300 like Ryan O'neal to play rock.

2758
02:10:11,241 --> 02:10:13,360
You're someone called Paul Newman.
I forget who it was.

2759
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:15,430
I feel,
I feel like it was Ryan O'neil,

2760
02:10:15,431 --> 02:10:18,490
they wanted Ryan o'neal to play rocky
and he held out and he's like,

2761
02:10:18,491 --> 02:10:19,900
no,
I fucking wrote this.

2762
02:10:19,901 --> 02:10:22,350
This is me your vehicle.
And that's it.

2763
02:10:22,390 --> 02:10:27,220
That's the greatest example of being
positively unstoppable in owning it.

2764
02:10:27,410 --> 02:10:32,410
Like just alone could have written this
book or has 100,000 times and when you

2765
02:10:32,980 --> 02:10:33,450
know,
like he,

2766
02:10:33,450 --> 02:10:36,020
he's,
he's one of my mentors without me

2767
02:10:36,021 --> 02:10:37,420
knowing him,
you know,

2768
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:41,570
because I've just watched how he's lived
his life and he's recreated themselves

2769
02:10:41,571 --> 02:10:45,170
so many times and that's what I'm
constantly trying to crazies of the guys

2770
02:10:45,171 --> 02:10:47,930
doing the expendables as a fucking
action star.

2771
02:10:47,930 --> 02:10:52,930
He's in his seven deans.
Crazy fuck in their seventies is

2772
02:10:52,941 --> 02:10:57,890
believable in inaction is guys have like
beat people up and movies like a

2773
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:00,020
suspension of disbelief.
I'll let it slide,

2774
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:02,720
but when you see him doing it,
you're like,

2775
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:06,110
I kind of believe it.
The guy's still jacked at 70,

2776
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:08,270
72,
I think 73 years old.

2777
02:11:08,271 --> 02:11:10,220
Whatever the fuck he is.
How old is he now?

2778
02:11:10,820 --> 02:11:13,640
Seventy two years old.
That's fucking insane.

2779
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:16,760
Let me give you a behind the scenes from
stone cold Steve Austin,

2780
02:11:16,761 --> 02:11:19,550
who was like a brother to me,
like a real one,

2781
02:11:19,551 --> 02:11:21,680
like literally we lived together.
We wrote together,

2782
02:11:21,681 --> 02:11:24,890
uh,
one of my best friends and he's doing

2783
02:11:24,891 --> 02:11:29,891
the first expendables and he's doing,
we talk about,

2784
02:11:30,890 --> 02:11:34,670
I guess he's on the set for about a
couple of weeks by this time and he

2785
02:11:34,671 --> 02:11:35,960
says,
I'll tell you what day.

2786
02:11:36,820 --> 02:11:41,420
And you remember every top Alpha dog is
in that first movie because he grabbed

2787
02:11:41,421 --> 02:11:41,930
the,
the,

2788
02:11:41,930 --> 02:11:43,640
you know,
the heavies of the heavies.

2789
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:46,550
The guys who had the biggest names and
uh,

2790
02:11:46,551 --> 02:11:51,551
Austin said in a world of Alpha dogs,
there is one number one guy and his name

2791
02:11:53,871 --> 02:11:56,360
is so bester stolen.
And he said,

2792
02:11:56,361 --> 02:11:59,060
when he were doing the Hollywood fight
in the back,

2793
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:01,490
stallone was like,
come on,

2794
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:03,530
bring it,
like meant it.

2795
02:12:03,590 --> 02:12:06,380
He broke his fucking,
broke his neck.

2796
02:12:06,381 --> 02:12:08,930
Have you seen his neck?
But they did an x ray of his neck.

2797
02:12:08,931 --> 02:12:12,860
He's got these fucking screws keeping
his spine together in his neck.

2798
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:16,400
He showed it on,
it was the shell or Letterman,

2799
02:12:16,730 --> 02:12:19,520
but he was on and they showed an x ray
of his neck.

2800
02:12:19,521 --> 02:12:24,260
He broke his fucking neck during that
movie because he's 68 at the time,

2801
02:12:24,261 --> 02:12:26,930
69.
And he's getting thrown into a wall.

2802
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:27,610
Right.
And,

2803
02:12:27,610 --> 02:12:32,610
and telling Austin who's a tough son of
a giant ring,

2804
02:12:33,050 --> 02:12:35,390
it wants it to be real.

2805
02:12:35,450 --> 02:12:36,760
I mean,
he is.

2806
02:12:36,810 --> 02:12:38,030
I mean,
look,

2807
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:40,940
he got knocked out by Antonio carver.
Oh,

2808
02:12:40,970 --> 02:12:43,760
Antonio Tarver in one of those rocky
movies,

2809
02:12:43,761 --> 02:12:44,510
right?
Right.

2810
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:46,880
I mean,
I think he was deep into his sixties and

2811
02:12:46,881 --> 02:12:49,700
he got fucking knocked out there doing
the boxing scenes where they're going

2812
02:12:49,701 --> 02:12:54,140
over things and tarver cracked him.
I would kill to do a workout with him

2813
02:12:54,141 --> 02:12:57,310
and show him because he.
Oh no one works out harder neck,

2814
02:12:58,090 --> 02:13:00,140
so I'll fucking fused together that
plates.

2815
02:13:00,950 --> 02:13:02,510
The bionic man.
Look at that.

2816
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:07,160
That's fucking crazy.
So he's got three discs fused together.

2817
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:10,160
He might be the toughest guy.
Pound for pound,

2818
02:13:10,190 --> 02:13:13,580
age for age alive.
What's a four months ago?

2819
02:13:14,030 --> 02:13:15,410
This is him.
Four months of the word.

2820
02:13:15,470 --> 02:13:17,800
God.
Who was the other guy there?

2821
02:13:18,610 --> 02:13:22,240
Take your sunglasses off bro.
Look at Jack.

2822
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:27,140
D is 72 crazy man.
I love the Guy Man.

2823
02:13:27,141 --> 02:13:30,140
I mean you want to feel good to sit down
and watch a rocky movie.

2824
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:31,320
I interviewed him.
Him Too.

2825
02:13:31,330 --> 02:13:32,130
He's a super nice

2826
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:34,650
guy and like real,
like self deprecating,

2827
02:13:34,860 --> 02:13:37,290
loose laugh doesn't take himself
seriously at all.

2828
02:13:37,640 --> 02:13:39,390
No Ego.
Just joking around.

2829
02:13:39,700 --> 02:13:41,490
Easy to like somebody heckled out.
He's like,

2830
02:13:41,580 --> 02:13:44,280
oh your mom.
Really funny.

2831
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:48,180
Funny Guy.
Real real nice guy to know.

2832
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:50,750
But listen man,
I'm,

2833
02:13:50,820 --> 02:13:52,110
I don't know what else we could talk
about,

2834
02:13:52,111 --> 02:13:53,970
but I think what you're doing is fucking
awesome.

2835
02:13:54,070 --> 02:13:56,820
I'm super pumped that we finally got
together.

2836
02:13:57,060 --> 02:13:58,830
I would love to do a workout with you
for sure.

2837
02:13:58,890 --> 02:14:00,450
Absolutely.
And what about,

2838
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:03,330
what about tomorrow?
What time?

2839
02:14:03,331 --> 02:14:05,550
Tomorrow?
I'm here.

2840
02:14:05,551 --> 02:14:08,550
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving on Thursday afternoon.

2841
02:14:08,730 --> 02:14:11,040
So I have.
Let's figure this out after.

2842
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:15,210
The one thing I want to do about this.
Let me tell you about the positively

2843
02:14:15,211 --> 02:14:16,770
unstoppable.
When to come out.

2844
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:19,440
The Art of owning it doesn't come out
until January,

2845
02:14:19,650 --> 02:14:20,850
but I,
here's my goal.

2846
02:14:20,930 --> 02:14:23,040
Okay.
I had two books before this.

2847
02:14:23,430 --> 02:14:26,970
I didn't push them to be best sellers
because they weren't really worthy.

2848
02:14:27,510 --> 02:14:31,260
This is because I know it's going to
really help people and here's the hook

2849
02:14:31,261 --> 02:14:33,300
that I want to do.
Reason why I want people to get it,

2850
02:14:33,780 --> 02:14:37,440
preorder it now,
and this is what I want to give with

2851
02:14:37,441 --> 02:14:42,441
this anyone and it's up on my site.
If you go to DDP yoga.com/positively

2852
02:14:43,921 --> 02:14:47,040
unstoppable,
and you ordered the book there,

2853
02:14:47,190 --> 02:14:50,370
there'll be an address right there.
The DDP Yoga performance center,

2854
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:51,211
which is one,
two,

2855
02:14:51,211 --> 02:14:52,860
three,
nine concord road,

2856
02:14:52,861 --> 02:14:53,700
Smyrna,
Georgia,

2857
02:14:53,701 --> 02:14:54,630
three zero,
zero,

2858
02:14:54,631 --> 02:14:58,050
eight zero.
If you send me a self addressed stamped

2859
02:14:58,290 --> 02:15:00,750
envelope,
we've got these book plates,

2860
02:15:00,751 --> 02:15:04,590
that Random House or random house book
and they send me these book plates that

2861
02:15:04,591 --> 02:15:09,591
I'm going to sign and if you send me
that self addressed stamped envelope

2862
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:14,700
with a proof that you purchased the book
that you preorder the book,

2863
02:15:15,240 --> 02:15:16,650
I'm going to send you my autograph.

2864
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:20,640
Well autographed from the book when I'm
doing a comicon,

2865
02:15:20,730 --> 02:15:24,300
I'm $40 for a picture.
$40 for an autograph,

2866
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:28,500
Sixty Dollars Combo.
The book costs 24 99.

2867
02:15:29,070 --> 02:15:32,220
So if you're looking to get a DDP,
each signature diamond Dallas page

2868
02:15:32,221 --> 02:15:34,260
signature,
you got it for the book.

2869
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:37,950
I will send it to you.
My goal is to make positively

2870
02:15:37,951 --> 02:15:42,220
unstoppable.
A best selling book and I think it might

2871
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:43,770
easiest,
easiest.

2872
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:48,660
The only way I'm really going to do it
is by preorder because I don't have any

2873
02:15:48,661 --> 02:15:50,550
machine behind me except for my own
shit,

2874
02:15:50,610 --> 02:15:53,850
you know,
and doing this the way I just want to

2875
02:15:53,851 --> 02:15:57,240
check one thing.
It was sort of look at you and where's

2876
02:15:57,241 --> 02:15:58,470
the,
what's the APP?

2877
02:15:58,471 --> 02:16:02,160
How can people find the APP?
The APP is at DDP Yoga Dot com,

2878
02:16:02,161 --> 02:16:06,360
like it's up on itunes and droid and if
they're looking for it on itunes or

2879
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:08,220
google marketplace,
but if it's,

2880
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:11,880
if it's on itunes or Android,
all it's going to cost more because you

2881
02:16:11,881 --> 02:16:13,860
know,
they charge more,

2882
02:16:13,861 --> 02:16:15,480
they tack on 30 percent.

2883
02:16:15,540 --> 02:16:18,990
So you can download the APP from your
website.

2884
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:23,610
You go to Dallas,
you go to Diamond Dallas page.com and

2885
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:28,290
you will be able to um,
get the APP right there.

2886
02:16:28,291 --> 02:16:31,240
And Right now I'm doing 20 percent off
work though.

2887
02:16:31,450 --> 02:16:33,730
Don't you have to go to the APP,
sort of put an APP on your phone?

2888
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:35,200
I'm not really actually.
Sure

2889
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:39,790
exactly.
Sure how that works,

2890
02:16:40,090 --> 02:16:43,270
but I just know if you're going to DDP
yoga.com,

2891
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:45,370
it's going to be cheaper and then you
got to get.

2892
02:16:45,371 --> 02:16:46,810
You get.
You can prep for a month,

2893
02:16:46,930 --> 02:16:48,370
three months,
a year,

2894
02:16:48,371 --> 02:16:50,620
whatever the deal.
We'll figure it out.

2895
02:16:50,650 --> 02:16:52,990
The one thing I do want to mention to
you is,

2896
02:16:53,410 --> 02:16:56,410
and maybe we can come back when this
gets released and talk about this,

2897
02:16:56,770 --> 02:16:59,170
but I've got a new documentary coming
out.

2898
02:16:59,171 --> 02:17:02,050
You've already seen and I know you're
going to love the resurrection.

2899
02:17:02,050 --> 02:17:03,340
Jake the snake,
if you want to see that.

2900
02:17:03,370 --> 02:17:06,310
We just took it off Netflix.
It's only on itunes.

2901
02:17:06,311 --> 02:17:10,330
It's like ninety nine cents.
It's absolutely the look up to inspire.

2902
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:13,390
You know,
everyone has some sort of addiction in

2903
02:17:13,391 --> 02:17:14,680
their life,
whether it's their uncle,

2904
02:17:14,681 --> 02:17:16,540
their father,
their sister or brother.

2905
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:22,200
There's somewhere around it.
I've had so many people come up to me in

2906
02:17:22,991 --> 02:17:25,330
so many people have come up to Jake and
say,

2907
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:30,520
that movie changed my life.
People say I'm three months sober,

2908
02:17:30,690 --> 02:17:35,690
I am two years sober.
Like that movie changed my life and Jake

2909
02:17:36,370 --> 02:17:40,750
doing the program,
it gave him a way to get wins,

2910
02:17:40,751 --> 02:17:45,230
meaning like going from 300,
seven pounds to under 302 to 78 and you

2911
02:17:45,231 --> 02:17:46,270
know,
and so forth.

2912
02:17:46,510 --> 02:17:49,420
But being able to move more and be able
to feel better.

2913
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:54,550
So resurrection gives you that
inspiration and you just watched

2914
02:17:54,940 --> 02:17:56,230
Arthur's video.

2915
02:17:56,620 --> 02:17:58,980
Well,
Jake's movie The resurrection snake,

2916
02:17:59,140 --> 02:18:01,930
you're gonna Laugh,
you're gonna cry.

2917
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:07,120
Most of all you're going to be inspired.
So the new documentary we are coming out

2918
02:18:07,390 --> 02:18:10,300
will be out sometime in 2019.
We'll,

2919
02:18:10,301 --> 02:18:15,301
I'll talk to you before it comes out and
it's called relentless and it goes from

2920
02:18:15,581 --> 02:18:19,030
the day that Kevin Nash blows my back
out and have gag set.

2921
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:21,150
He didn't do it.
It was my body was finally brought.

2922
02:18:21,160 --> 02:18:23,200
He's always trying to protect me and
vice versa.

2923
02:18:23,770 --> 02:18:26,980
But when I blew my back out to where we
are today,

2924
02:18:27,490 --> 02:18:30,520
we have actually take out the wrestling
shit.

2925
02:18:30,910 --> 02:18:35,910
We have 16 years of footage of this
entire journey up and down and up and

2926
02:18:36,161 --> 02:18:41,161
down and how we became with the program
at eight year overnight success,

2927
02:18:43,510 --> 02:18:47,700
and this is one of the most inspiring
movies I know anybody will ever see now.

2928
02:18:47,701 --> 02:18:50,320
It'll be out this year.
