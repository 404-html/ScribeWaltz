1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,040
[inaudible]

2
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,773
the tank.

3
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,680
So Gilbert,

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,320
the thing,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,330
anybody could use the tag.

6
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:29,820
It's Bilbo,

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,653
right?

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,580
Can you think Brian?

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,240
Yeah.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,050
You're ready for you?

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,010
You relax in there.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,030
You know the whole deal behind it.

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:35,571
Oh yeah.

14
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:36,590
You float on salt water.

15
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:37,550
You see Jesus.

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,511
Good Bill.

17
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:41,270
Get in it.

18
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,720
We're just gonna.

19
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,980
I'm gonna start getting this,

20
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:44,030
this fucking box.

21
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:45,530
We're going to start
filling it up with water.

22
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,640
Silver.

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,340
We would love to have you on the podcast.

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,920
Do a podcast blog to me and Brian made up.

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,480
We already made up ever the
c level couple of fist bumps.

26
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,960
Lotion.

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,793
It was fun though.

28
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,560
You're going to get
trolled hard now though.

29
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,211
You realize that,

30
00:00:58,211 --> 00:00:58,511
right?

31
00:00:58,511 --> 00:00:58,961
The Internet,

32
00:00:58,961 --> 00:00:59,794
those fucking kids.

33
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,610
First of all,

34
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,600
I don't read like I even got it.

35
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,693
Does it?

36
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,230
You don't read your emails?

37
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,093
Yeah.

38
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,610
Okay.

39
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,010
That's why it's this or probably
just contact the a thousand times

40
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,830
they're trying to take
pill away from me still.

41
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,220
If they contacted me,

42
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:20,870
I never said that they could take it.

43
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,143
Jeez.

44
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,290
Can RSSP right Brian,

45
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,740
tell them about the second you
take your car in the driveway.

46
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:27,921
I mean,

47
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,221
right there.

48
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:28,851
That's your fault.

49
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:30,810
If you put it in a parking
lot and somebody steals it,

50
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,563
show me.

51
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,510
How are you Jimmy?

52
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,390
How are you?

53
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,223
Are you excited

54
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,830
when you think about tonight buddy?

55
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,371
Ah,

56
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:46,870
I want to,

57
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,480
I don't want to give my pick
because every time John,

58
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,320
every time I pick every one I picked,

59
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,040
I kind of don't want to jinx him.

60
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,320
Like what do you think should fear?

61
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,440
John Jones very confidently says this.

62
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:00,781
Yeah,

63
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,614
I like John Zone.

64
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,040
That's why I wanted to win.

65
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,850
I'm like the guy in what's happening.

66
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,940
Who was picking the off then?

67
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,390
It wouldn't be run was picking
the teams based on their helmets.

68
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,070
I don't remember what's
happening at Wayne.

69
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,910
Good reference though for 2011.

70
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:12,744
And what's happening?

71
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,311
What was that?

72
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:16,160
1997 what's happening now?

73
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,351
What's happening now?

74
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:18,890
What is that?

75
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,030
That was the remake of what's happening.

76
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:20,990
And that was the guy that was the,

77
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:21,100
uh,

78
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,130
the second helping of it.

79
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:22,790
Yeah.

80
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,241
What was,

81
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:25,400
what happened was that it
was all the early eighties,

82
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:25,720
right?

83
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,553
Yeah,

84
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,470
they do.

85
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,180
And I are old and we're
just starting to give out.

86
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,050
How old do you know?

87
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,260
42 got Sam.

88
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,290
43 yeah.

89
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,433
Oldest.

90
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,610
How old are you?

91
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,190
37 37 you're still
holding onto his thirties.

92
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,560
You still got a strong
three years to go by.

93
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:41,720
What a non uncomfortable camera person am.

94
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:44,300
I am actually looking into the
lens like a fucking retard.

95
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,560
I'm looking at you though.

96
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,020
We Miss John Ona yesterday.

97
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,541
Thank you.

98
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:47,691
Yeah,

99
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:48,980
I was going up picking Boston.

100
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,000
Brian.

101
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,120
Yeah.

102
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,750
I had to go from Florida to Boston through
the Wilberg probably rather have been

103
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,400
studio.

104
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,030
It was fine.

105
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,211
Yeah.

106
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:59,100
I know you shop and came in through,

107
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,410
what was he promoting was even more than
that thing in the village for teller.

108
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,463
Yeah.

109
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,301
Teller will come on.

110
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,260
I actually got voicemail.

111
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:06,094
Some tellers.

112
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,750
I want to play them on the yard so bad,

113
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,360
but I can't cause us any.

114
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,031
My I leaving and he's like,

115
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:10,350
hey man,

116
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,700
you think he was inviting me to the show?

117
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:13,534
It's actually good.

118
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,081
And I'm like,

119
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:14,914
I can't,

120
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,440
I can't play it on the uh,

121
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,490
on the salads because he doesn't talk.

122
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,790
He did a fear factor.

123
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:21,800
You didn't talk to him the whole show,

124
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,440
but he talked in between takes.

125
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,250
It was kind of weird.

126
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:24,530
Yeah.

127
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:24,970
It was like,

128
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,740
and then we would do the show and nothing.

129
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,280
Yeah.

130
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,461
Yeah.

131
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:27,701
You know?

132
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:29,950
But that's a perfect kid from had you
locked up because he loves the APP.

133
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,281
Yeah.

134
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:31,060
He's a good talker.

135
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,331
Yeah,

136
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:32,140
it's perfect.

137
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,410
Yeah.

138
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,243
It's a balance.

139
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,133
What are you think of that?

140
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,080
I don't have any fucking idea.

141
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,850
Shoguns and killer man.

142
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,590
You know a lot of people
are selling them short.

143
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,540
Shoguns got a lot of fucking experience,

144
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,050
man.

145
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,861
He's an assassin.

146
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,270
He's a cold blooded motherfucker.

147
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:46,990
He's not.

148
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,220
He's going to find openings.

149
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,241
The thing is,

150
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:50,890
John Jones is a super talent man.

151
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:52,630
He's like a Michael Jordan type character.

152
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,030
They're just unbelievably
physically gifted.

153
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,111
Who knows,

154
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:56,590
man.

155
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,940
That's what makes it exciting.

156
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,420
My theory is that Joe Rogan
always talk about the guy.

157
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,220
He doesn't think he's going to win a
lot more because he's got a chance.

158
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,220
Who wants to make sure everyone
knows about those chances?

159
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,490
And you've been talking nonstop about
about Shogun and how much of a killer,

160
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:09,730
you know,

161
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,690
how dare you,

162
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,510
how dare you find my
strategy for commentating.

163
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,190
Okay.

164
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:14,590
How come?

165
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,423
Freaked out.

166
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,451
Freaked out with these guys.

167
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:18,160
Be If I just have to
know and utilize models.

168
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,270
They do it like it all Shogun seem right?

169
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,323
Yeah.

170
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,571
Yeah,

171
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:24,760
they,

172
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,790
they get creeped out when want
