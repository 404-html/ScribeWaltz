1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,400
That good luck with the yellow brick 
road.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,990
Yeah.
That's some good songs.

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,890
Oh yeah.
Dude.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,680
The bitches back.
Oh,

5
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:09,390
and but lively's gentlemen,
shrimp raid.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,900
Powerful Duncan trussell's in the house.
Come back.

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,900
Dr Chris Ryan looking like you're fresh 
off of vacation.

8
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:18,300
Like we just pulled you out of somewhat 
sale,

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,050
but as on a fishing trip.
Perfect,

10
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:22,884
right?
Yeah.

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,790
The endless vacation.
We were talking about Elton John,

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,683
right before we start.
I think there's some Elton John Songs 

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,370
that are just all time classics,
you know?

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,950
Yeah.
What are your favorite top three?

15
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,850
Boy,
I'm man.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,620
Do you like Daniel?
That's the best.

17
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,720
That's a great song.
Rocket Man is one of my favorites.

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,150
I don't know.
I never,

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,320
I never thought about that.
Let me,

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,880
let me go over the lyrics.
You know,

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,140
that's one of those songs.
You just.

22
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,850
The lyrics almost become inconsequential
because the lyrics are,

23
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,930
oh,
this is the sound.

24
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:58,764
That song makes that song.
That song has this feeling like listen 

25
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,110
to a song in a different language.
Right?

26
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,633
It's just an instrument.
It's weird when you find out what song 

27
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,680
is about and it's the opposite.
Oh,

28
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,450
what does it say what it is now?
This is just the lyrics.

29
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,130
It's a bad or an astronaut or a lyric.
I don't think it is.

30
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:19,410
I think it's about like snorting 
ketamine.

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,870
Is that what it is?
It's a space.

32
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:24,300
I miss my wife.
I missed the earth so much.

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,670
You just guessing Dunkin.
Well,

34
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,460
I mean we all get to interpret music in 
our own way,

35
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:30,980
but for sure that's out in.

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,973
Johnny's in some hotel room is laid out 
some blinds academy and he's about the 

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,380
baseline is here.
It says,

38
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,150
uh,
during the Druggie or a,

39
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,250
given that it was penn during the 19 
seventies drug era,

40
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,203
people can still see that it services an
extended metaphor comparing fame to 

41
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:47,510
space travel.
Wow.

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,680
That makes.
That makes a ton of sense.

43
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,323
But it also.
I bet it also was about rocket travel 

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,620
because Bernie top and wrote it.
Yeah,

45
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,563
he wrote it.
He wrote them on what a great 

46
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,950
combination.
The two of those guys like you and young

47
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,540
Jamie,
very similar.

48
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,790
Nobody ever hears about young Jamie.
Last time I was here,

49
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,390
I tried to get them on my podcast.
He's,

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,333
he's alluding me really smart.
Just want to be on your crazy podcasts 

51
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:15,620
out in the woods.
Can come into the van.

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Jamie was on Saturday night.
That's a great one.

53
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,420
Alright,
for fight.

54
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:25,710
Yeah,
that's a good one.

55
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,440
That's a great workout.
So it's a real kind of.

56
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,630
Yeah,
it's like a punk.

57
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:32,400
British.
Yeah.

58
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,234
Saturday night Daniels.
The first time I really thought about 

59
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:36,720
Spain.
It's about Daniel,

60
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:39,510
my brother.
He's headed out on the plane.

61
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:43,560
I can see the red tail lights head and 
for Spain friend dying.

62
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,400
He's blind.
No,

63
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,560
it's about as blind brother interpreting
all of your messaging.

64
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,630
You must have a lot.
I like him less.

65
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,470
I like the.
What his songs are about.

66
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,660
You know what's interesting about this 
conversation is trying to interpret with

67
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:01,494
songs are,
is very actual thing that happened when 

68
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:07,990
people were trying to interpret the 
stories from the Bible,

69
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,530
but it's basically the same thing.
We're trying to figure out.

70
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:12,460
No,
he met this.

71
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,330
No,
he meant that these parables and some of

72
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:15,920
the stories that are in the Bible,
you know,

73
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,030
if you go to the John Marco Allegro 
definition,

74
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,090
was it say his song was written from his
younger brother's perspective.

75
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,560
Got a story about a guy who went back to
a small town in Texas returning from the

76
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,250
Vietnam War.
Wow.

77
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,780
Okay.
That's Daniel.

78
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,250
And he was blind.
Right?

79
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:35,660
Your eyes have died,
but you see more than I.

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,930
Oh wow.
Huh?

81
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,270
Do you still feel the pain of the scars 
that won't heal?

82
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,183
Yes.

83
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,940
Have you guys heard,
you know that song?

84
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:44,650
Summer of 69.
Jamie,

85
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:46,780
maybe you can bring this to Brian Adams 
one,

86
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,440
and that's about like actually 68,
69.

87
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,880
Oh really?
Yeah,

88
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:52,780
that's what I know.
Again,

89
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:53,614
like every single one of them,
but look it up because I think the 

90
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,140
summer of 69,
one interpretation is that's like a fuck

91
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:06,130
summer.
He had like $69 a month.

92
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:07,050
Summer.
Is that,

93
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,040
is that true?
Yes.

94
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,580
Is it true?
I

95
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,290
had my first real six string,
a Bryan Adams fourth album,

96
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,770
reckless.
Some are 69 in many meetings,

97
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:23,040
although one of them including life in 
1969,

98
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,710
while another includes making love with 
someone,

99
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:28,680
hence using the number 69 as a reference
boy.

100
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,560
That's not accurate the way they said 
that.

101
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,150
It's just like the Internet 
interpretation.

102
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,984
Sorry.
What I meant was it's like you would 

103
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:38,064
never say that.
That wouldn't be how you convey your 

104
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:41,184
feelings.
Like if you're writing that song like 

105
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:45,980
the summer of 69 and this say.
Hold on,

106
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,823
go back to that please.
It says while another includes making 

107
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:53,580
love with someone that is just.
That's not an accurate way.

108
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,400
I'm talking about 69 ing.
I mean,

109
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:58,770
yeah,
you're making love but you get crazy.

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,633
It's like there's more to it than that.
That was like the same thing as like 

111
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,310
trying to interpret stories from a Bible
or something like that.

112
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,143
Like you're boiling them down like 
you're trying to figure out what was 

113
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:10,470
this guy actually say?
Yeah.

114
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,810
You know,
like literary interpretation.

115
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,120
It's all poetry,
right.

116
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,330
My favorite example of a song that sort 
of mislead you.

117
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:19,164
I mean,
I really like songs were the covers 

118
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,023
better than the original because the 
person doing the cover gets what the 

119
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,980
song's about better than the original 
artists does.

120
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,320
I mean all along the watchtower.
Hendrix is way better than Dylan's.

121
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:33,090
Right?
Dillon actually said that,

122
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,790
but my favorite example in recent music 
is.

123
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,940
Hey Ya.
By outkast.

124
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,671
Oh,
okay.

125
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,550
You know,
shake it like a polaroid picture.

126
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:42,384
Hey.
Yeah.

127
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,610
My baby don't mess around because she 
loves me.

128
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,444
So just I know for sure you know,
it's real upbeat at it or listen to the 

129
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,194
words,
but does she really want to but can't 

130
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:51,954
stand to see me walk out the door.
Don't try to stop the feeling because 

131
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:57,210
the thought alone is killing me right 
now.

132
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:57,980
Thank

133
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,940
God for Mom and dad for sticking to 
together because we don't know how.

134
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,700
It's all about how we don't know how to 
love each other.

135
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,410
Wow.
Yeah.

136
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:08,480
Hey fellas,
what's cooler than being cool?

137
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,403
Ice Cold.
If what they say is nothing lasts 

138
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:14,690
forever,
then what makes love the exception?

139
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,621
Oh,
why?

140
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,454
Oh,
why are we so in denial when we know 

141
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:20,240
we're not happy here.
Wow.

142
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,940
It's a really sad song.
Super Sad.

143
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,570
Yeah.
There's a dude who did a cover of it.

144
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,490
Oh,
Obadiah Parker.

145
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,070
See,
the thing that I really like about,

146
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,340
he gets it.
He gets the sadness of it,

147
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,743
play.
Some of that

148
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,790
is seen me.

149
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,700
I can't see the feeling because the 
thought alone is,

150
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:52,670
Holy Shit,
dude.

151
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,760
Again,
because we don't know.

152
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:02,170
Wow,
this is fucking great.

153
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:04,444
Hey,
there's people right now screaming at 

154
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:07,844
their phone.

155
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,683
I don't know what grade it is,
so fucking sick of your music taste so 

156
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,980
bad.
Music tastes are so bad.

157
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,340
I get to more tweets about how bad my 
bad

158
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,800
taste is in music and movies and 
television and blame it on me.

159
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,620
Did that cut Chris Ryan?
Yeah,

160
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:29,454
I was.
I was looking at something the other 

161
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:31,134
day,
some something on some video years of 

162
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,623
comments or something and it occurred to
me how you have your audience is first 

163
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:38,484
of all so large and also so mix because 
you've got your fingers in all these 

164
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:42,444
different worlds that you must get a lot
more hostility than someone like Duncan 

165
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,620
or me because our audience is more sort 
of homogeneous.

166
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:53,430
I would think I'm the bridge between the
meatheads and the potheads exactly.

167
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,920
So there's conflict and no matter which 
way you go,

168
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,610
there's a little bit,

169
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,443
but the meatheads kind of get that look 
if you want to go to the far end of the 

170
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:04,770
extreme.
It's like the UFC fans,

171
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,220
but the UFC fans know,
like I'm a,

172
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,410
I'm a representative,
like I'm doing my best.

173
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:13,290
Like they know I'm 100 percent into 
this.

174
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,540
This is not like I'm not like some actor
that they hired to promote this so.

175
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,930
But then you got all the way to the far 
left which is the psychedelic people and

176
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:25,380
I got a ton of Vegan followers and 
people that are really into yoga.

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,833
It's like all of them together.
It's like the weirdest fucking house 

178
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,230
party

179
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,610
it seems sometimes.
The comments,

180
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,430
well no man,
this is like,

181
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,463
what is this?
This Ram das retreat that I just went 

182
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:36,700
to,
one of the,

183
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,533
one of the people who run runs their 
treat wanted me to tell it to thank you 

184
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,711
because he's like,
you know,

185
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:46,150
your podcast brings a lot of people to 
these randazzo retreats,

186
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:46,984
which is,
to me it was such a strange thing to 

187
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:49,864
think man that you're magnetizing people
and bringing them down a slippery where 

188
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:55,980
they

189
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,980
land in Maui,
hanging out with like Buddhist and Hindu

190
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,810
teachers.
It's really crazy,

191
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,490
man.
It's a very odd thing.

192
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,730
How many?
Like how many tentacles you have fucking

193
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:10,350
burning man.
Jesus Christ.

194
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,080
Burning man.
Everybody wants you to go,

195
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,190
man.
You've got to go.

196
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,640
You got it.
Go.

197
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,900
When is it again?
It's like it's all coming season.

198
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:24,030
Late August there listening.
He can't bring some elks to burning man.

199
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,880
I can't interact with that.
Many people do that anymore.

200
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,500
Those days are done,
but you know what?

201
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,420
What has changed?
Like a big.

202
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:33,760
One of the biggest thing that's ever 
changed because of this podcast.

203
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,560
The float industry.
Yeah.

204
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,900
Floating streets taken off.
I get like residual gratitude from float

205
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,010
places like I know you know Joe Rogan,
you can float for free.

206
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,180
Wow,
that's amazing.

207
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,561
Well,
the thing is,

208
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:50,680
it just didn't make any sense to me that
before I was talking about it,

209
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:53,410
no one was talking about that this was 
something that was invented by Lillian.

210
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,430
What?
Nineteen 60 something happened where you

211
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,264
were vertical know he had one where you 
would wear a helmet and you had a 

212
00:10:00,581 --> 00:10:02,950
harness and helmet with float you,
you know,

213
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:05,960
and then he figured out the salt thing 
and um,

214
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,060
I mean the fact that this was not a 
popular thing was blown me away.

215
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:10,923
Well it was,
but then it died because of the age 

216
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:13,280
thing.
Yeah.

217
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,950
And you brought it back for this 
popular?

218
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,491
No,
no,

219
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:18,700
but it was much.
It was higher than it dropped a lot.

220
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,210
They killed it because nobody knew,
sort of brought it back in.

221
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:23,620
Yeah.
So with John Lilly,

222
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,733
you know what's interesting about him,
people leave out about him a lot is he 

223
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:29,554
was talking to aliens and it's an 
interesting thing that people just kind 

224
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:36,230
of push all that shit aside.
They know him as the flow guy,

225
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:38,690
you've in a float tank,
dolphin and the Dolphin Guy,

226
00:10:38,691 --> 00:10:39,524
but also they completely leave out that 
he was going into those tanks and 

227
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:43,604
claiming some kind of communication with
something called the ECC or something 

228
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,134
eco,
you know about that they're earth 

229
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:52,730
coincidence control office or something,
you know about that.

230
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,580
Then the center of the cyclone.
Yeah,

231
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,443
center the,
but he was going way out talking about 

232
00:10:58,071 --> 00:11:03,071
some kind of like invisible I guess 
network that produces coincidence is.

233
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,633
I don't understand it at all,
but people just completely leave that 

234
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:10,274
out.
That the guy created float tanks was 

235
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:14,450
using them to communicate with entities

236
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,320
and he was using a lot of ketamine.
A lot academy.

237
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,620
Yeah.
Or maybe they.

238
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,860
They're leaving out that the guy who 
invented float tanks lost his shit there

239
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:23,980
toward the end.
Well,

240
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,620
he may be,
but I think that.

241
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,010
I don't know what's happening when 
you're doing psychedelics,

242
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,873
but there are certain psychedelics where
it absolutely feels like you're 

243
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,080
experiencing another life form 
communicating with you.

244
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,020
For sure.
For sure.

245
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:37,854
Right now,
if that's the case with ketamine as 

246
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:42,330
well.
Ketamine seems to be like me personally,

247
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:43,164
my personal bias,
I sort of dismiss it because I think of 

248
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:48,880
it as some sort of chemical compound 
things,

249
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:51,180
some sort of a synthetic thing.
That man's career,

250
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,410
Ketamine,
what?

251
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,090
Something is more

252
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,933
reliable,
but I think that's just my own 

253
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,763
ignorance.
I think really we're just talking about 

254
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:00,040
chemicals.
Right?

255
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:00,874
And how chemicals that exist in nature.
It's like when someone says it's an 

256
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:04,354
artificial chemical,
well that's not real because everything 

257
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:08,500
is natural.
Everything's here.

258
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,513
Like it might've been concocted and put 
together and baked and cooked and 

259
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,890
synthesize by a person,
but of course it's all natural.

260
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,730
Everything that's exists.
Antics though,

261
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,593
because it isn't.
It isn't in that these chemicals most 

262
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:26,440
likely have some sort of a corresponding
receptor in the human brain.

263
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,630
Right?
Or something similar.

264
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,280
Something similar molecule.
Yeah.

265
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,760
And it's a natural thing.
Like that's the craziest thing about the

266
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:36,700
most potent drugs,
whether it's still assignment or whether

267
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:37,534
it's dimethyltryptamine,
they have like really similar 

268
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,290
composition did normal human 
neurochemistry keys.

269
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,260
Like there are keys that fit a certain 
lock.

270
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,210
That's how they put it.

271
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,073
Yeah.
But I do think that there is a 

272
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:54,190
distinction between natural and 
unnatural in the sense that something,

273
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,960
because I get this argument all the 
time,

274
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:56,301
right?
Oh,

275
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:57,910
people created it,
so it's natural,

276
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:02,530
but there are things that exist in the 
natural system,

277
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:06,640
like plastics don't exist in the natural
ecosystem and therefore they don't break

278
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,590
down.
They don't become part of the food chain

279
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:12,010
in a beneficial way.
Whereas things that have existed in that

280
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:16,810
system for a long time do they fit into 
it and I think in terms of drugs,

281
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:21,790
there are drugs like ghb that exists 
naturally in the body that we metabolize

282
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,150
absolutely cleanly because the liver 
knows exactly what it is.

283
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:30,390
It's prepared to deal with it and it 
doesn't cause any organic toxicity,

284
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,234
no neurotoxicity.
But then there are other things like 

285
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:37,840
alcohol which are natural in a sense 
that fruits for meant and all that,

286
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:40,690
but the body doesn't metabolize it 
cleanly.

287
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,523
So it damages us in.
Particularly if you're from a very 

288
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:45,910
specific part of the world,
right where it's a.

289
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,033
If it's not a part of your customer,
which is why it was such a giant issue 

290
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:53,200
when Europeans came here,
they didn't.

291
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,150
They didn't have any history with 
alcohol.

292
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,851
Well,
well,

293
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:58,450
you know Hamilton Morris,
a device guy.

294
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:00,190
He tweeted this thing I thought was 
pretty smart.

295
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,390
Probably a little controversial.
Forgive me if I miss quote it,

296
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,800
but it's something along the lines of 
it's drugs,

297
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,130
it's drugs and that word is a 
controversial word.

298
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:12,340
Somehow people like to use the term 
plant Madison,

299
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:13,174
which is okay.
You can call it plant medicine or you 

300
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:15,784
can call it whatever you want,
but to create a hierarchy based on 

301
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,083
synthesis I think is to sort of miss the
point which is that all of these things 

302
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:24,334
are tools and some of them we have more 
of a history with humanity and some of 

303
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:30,520
them we don't.
The ones we don't,

304
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,590
which is my God,
there's so many.

305
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,570
There's so many new drugs that are just 
popping up all the time.

306
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,800
Different derivatives of Lsd,
things you can like right now apparently

307
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:46,390
you can order sheets of this stuff that 
is like Lsd,

308
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:49,240
but it's in the gray area.
It's still kind of legal,

309
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,430
it's like a different version of,
but we don't know

310
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,383
yet the effects it's going to have 
because it's not like anyone's really 

311
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:56,564
testing it out.
So I say the name because Jeff sessions 

312
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:58,964
is listening at one hand as you're 
writing down little southern big scary 

313
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:14,270
of Jeff sessions at a giant Dick Table.
Yeah.

314
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,253
But anyway,
I think this talking to a woman who had 

315
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:21,280
sex with a little person and she said he
had a normal sized Dick [inaudible] that

316
00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:22,114
big heads.
So Jeff sessions with a normal sized 

317
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:28,460
Dick would be interesting 
proportionally.

318
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,421
Yeah.
I don't know.

319
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:33,410
I mean just scary to think about like 
that jeff sessions having like some kind

320
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:34,430
of like.
Because you know,

321
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:35,480
he's such a,
you know,

322
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:38,690
he's just such a quintessential pig,
you know,

323
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:39,524
and it's like you want the 
quintessential pig to have some kind of 

324
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:44,960
like to be almost like a unit or 
something.

325
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:45,794
But it's terrifying to imagine the jeff 
sessions when he takes his clothes off 

326
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,533
probably as like six nipples.
It was just running right down the 

327
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:56,090
middle of his fucking chest.

328
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,823
They usually,
it gets wet when he's like arresting 

329
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:04,680
people.
They who's the little goat knobs that he

330
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:08,090
has to fall file down.
Go Nazi pro.

331
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:11,810
Yeah.
He's got file private prisons.

332
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:12,644
He visits private prisons and just pulls
out his massive throbbing cock in front 

333
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:18,650
of people who've been sentenced there 
for life.

334
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,340
It's right on that screen that you put 
your hand on.

335
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,510
Mr.
Sessions.

336
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:26,330
I was standing up for it.
I just want you to know that going after

337
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,410
medical marijuana,
again,

338
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,660
it's trying to.
It's almost like he can't help himself.

339
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:33,020
He knows what the laws are and it's 
almost like I just want to grab them.

340
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,240
Let me just grab,
just grab them.

341
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,560
I know what science says,
but I've got my personal opinions on the

342
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:40,394
thing and that's what matters.
Just anytime there's one person who has 

343
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:44,924
authority over another person and 
they've lived an entire life in that 

344
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:47,990
position.

345
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,020
That's their ecosystem.
Their ecosystem is they have authority,

346
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,970
they enforce laws,
they lock people up.

347
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,480
They put in this the game that gets the 
game they play and be successful.

348
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,680
Yeah.
Not just that.

349
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,723
It's like there's an objective.
It's literally like almost like a 

350
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:03,500
monopoly game,
like you see what the thing is to arrest

351
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:04,580
people.
You're,

352
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:07,460
you're the guy who arrest people,
you arrest people and convict people.

353
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,870
That's your game.
That's what you do.

354
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,733
You're plugged into the machine.
Do you know an interesting thing about 

355
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:12,794
monopoly?
It was invented by an anarchist who was 

356
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,660
invented it to teach kids the evils of 
capitalism.

357
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,210
Wow.
Really?

358
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,320
That's incredible.
Goofy.

359
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:28,120
Anarchists are the exact opposite thing.
It's like what they do to it.

360
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:31,340
It wasn't supposed to be fun.
It was supposed to demonstrate that when

361
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,320
you accumulate capital,
you ended up taking it.

362
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:34,940
All right.
Wait,

363
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:36,200
what do you think?
And Arkansas.

364
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,273
Well,
I think that anarchistic or people who 

365
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:39,404
want to diminish this system that we 
have have far less rules have far less 

366
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:45,850
government.
Right?

367
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,100
And usually they're kind of spastic and

368
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:50,851
their,
their,

369
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:51,684
their,
the way they express themselves is 

370
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:53,750
always like very awkward

371
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,950
court like Libertarians.
Well,

372
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,873
but you know,
you know,

373
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,843
you know,
like I've just been reading this book 

374
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:01,220
are a narco syndicate.
Realism.

375
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,490
It's like this,
I cannot dance.

376
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,453
It's really interesting to look at the 
history of anarchism like when it comes 

377
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:07,964
from versus what it gets interrupt 
because I remember when I was in high 

378
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:11,534
school or do you remember drawing the 
fucking anarchy symbol and you'd be 

379
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:18,490
like,
yeah man didn't even know what it made.

380
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:20,300
You're just assuming you know,
but,

381
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:25,330
but I think one part of it that's really
beautiful is the idea that we don't need

382
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,613
withered old prunes like jeff sessions 
telling us what we can put in our 

383
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:32,690
bodies.
We don't need that.

384
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,531
That's true.
And,

385
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:34,130
and,
and,

386
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:34,963
and that how many jeff sessions are 
there and the power structure and then 

387
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,080
where it gets really fucking cool man.
Check out David Graber.

388
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,820
You should have him on the podcast.
My God,

389
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:45,820
he's fucking brilliant what you're 
doing.

390
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,490
He's an author and he,
I'm a philosopher,

391
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:51,100
I guess you could say,
but uh,

392
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,530
he is incredible.
And he wrote a book called,

393
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,920
I think it's called the Utopia of rules 
that I've been reading,

394
00:18:57,921 --> 00:19:02,530
which is pretty fucking bad ass.
And it's just sort of breaking down like

395
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,200
the,
um,

396
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,670
the bureaucracy that we're in right now,
bureaucracy,

397
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:08,504
all the fucking forms you got to fill 
out to do just about anything these 

398
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,830
days,
like all these fucking forums.

399
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:12,830
It's insanity,
right?

400
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,673
Right.
But then where it gets really 

401
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:19,481
interesting is he's right now.
So like in like communists states the,

402
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,413
the,
the,

403
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,830
the corporations in the state are kind 
of the same thing.

404
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:29,780
So there's these like Ministry of Labor,
the stores are all national stores,

405
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:30,614
you know.
And so we think that that's not what's 

406
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:33,260
happening right now.

407
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,170
But actually because the people were 
running,

408
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:37,004
a lot of the corporations used to be in 
government and the people who are in 

409
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:42,800
government used to be running these big 
corporations.

410
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:43,993
One of the cool points he makes and also
because the government is making the 

411
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:49,280
rules that the corporations are working 
by,

412
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,280
but the corporations are putting their 
own agents into the state.

413
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,443
He saying the actually the line between 
the state and private companies is 

414
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:57,734
really blurry right now.
They're kind of merging together 

415
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,513
together.
But we like to pretend that there are 

416
00:20:02,741 --> 00:20:03,980
separate,
for example,

417
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:04,814
what's happening right now with the 
fucking fcc trying to take away the 

418
00:20:07,521 --> 00:20:08,354
internet with verizon having one of 
their fucking pig drones in a 

419
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,633
superposition of power right now is 
trying to take away the freedom of the 

420
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:18,270
Internet.
The state can be like we.

421
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:20,000
The corporations can blame it on the 
state.

422
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,160
It's just clarifying by what

423
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,993
you mean by that,
because they're not trying to take away 

424
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:27,310
the freedom of the Internet to try and 
to try and get rid of net neutrality.

425
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,270
Exactly.
Yeah.

426
00:20:28,271 --> 00:20:32,020
So what did it mean is that you will 
have to probably pay more.

427
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,873
Yeah.
To access things that require more 

428
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:37,300
bandwidth and it's going to be.
It's not.

429
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:42,010
It's going to be what it is now where 
every website has open access it you two

430
00:20:42,011 --> 00:20:42,581
versions,
right?

431
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:44,980
You get the capitalist version.
I think it's a good idea,

432
00:20:44,981 --> 00:20:47,470
and then you get the tech version,
which thinks is terrible idea.

433
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,980
I almost

434
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,000
always go towards the tech for.
Yeah,

435
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,303
but that's the Anaconda.
You know the way an Anaconda kills 

436
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:53,814
somebody,
every time you exhale it squeezes in a 

437
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,150
little bit.
That's all.

438
00:20:57,151 --> 00:20:59,170
Like right now,
it's the squeeze in as,

439
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:01,270
okay,
this fucking Internet.

440
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,750
It sucks.
If you're somebody like jeff sessions,

441
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:05,584
that's not.
That's not where the money's coming 

442
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:08,410
from.
I think you're misinterpreting the whole

443
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:10,150
idea.
It's all just a business thing.

444
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,970
It's like being able to throttle the 
data and being able to decide like,

445
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:15,804
like if Netflix wants you on there,
if you want to have netflix on the 

446
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:20,014
network,
they want to be able to work out some 

447
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:21,844
sort of a deal.
They don't want to treat netflix like 

448
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:24,200
it's any other sort of streaming 
service.

449
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:25,120
Like you look at it,
the,

450
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,173
the,
the,

451
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,253
the business transactions.
So they're looking at in a business 

452
00:21:29,261 --> 00:21:31,240
sense,
they're not saying the internet sucks.

453
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,460
No one is trying to like squeeze the 
Internet,

454
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:35,590
stop it with the trying to do is make 
more money.

455
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,191
Well,
okay,

456
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:37,140
great.
They're trying,

457
00:21:37,141 --> 00:21:37,671
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah,

458
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,190
I do here.
I do know what you're saying,

459
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:40,024
but I think it's a slippery slope and 
it's that idea of the Internet being 

460
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,690
treated like,
I don't know,

461
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,543
water,
the Internet being treated like just a 

462
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:47,884
thing that no corporation should have 
any kind of say that that to me it has 

463
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:57,420
to stay like that because the moment 
some corporation,

464
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,140
whoever it may be,
it gets to start deciding,

465
00:21:59,141 --> 00:21:59,974
yeah,
you guys need to pay a little bit more 

466
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,433
and if we establish that corporations in
the state aren't as separate as we like 

467
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:06,634
to think,
then suddenly there's all kinds of back 

468
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:08,914
channels there.
Suddenly there becomes a new way to 

469
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,440
begin to filter out content and you 
could say it's for money.

470
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,513
You start building financial walls 
around things and you start making 

471
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:18,874
things vanished into the background 
because they aren't in some big 

472
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:25,480
conglomerate that's paying off the 
corporations more or whatever.

473
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,480
You just mess up the whole thing,
which as far as I can tell,

474
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,200
it's doing great.
The Internet.

475
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,113
Great.
This fucking compound you're in right 

476
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:33,970
now,
you know,

477
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,940
a lot of it came from the Internet.
This thing we're doing right now,

478
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,650
it's the way the Internet's been 
working.

479
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,603
Oh Dude.
No one's a bigger proponent of the 

480
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:41,434
internet than I am.
I just think when we're talking about 

481
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,750
these issues,
you've got to be.

482
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,950
You've got to be really like objective.
What's trying to happen here.

483
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,770
They're not trying to silence dissent.
They're just trying to,

484
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,023
trying to make as much money as possible
and this is a weird tricky time when it 

485
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:59,950
comes to information and we do have to 
be very careful because it could wind up

486
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:00,790
being like,
Hey,

487
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:02,690
you get your internet from comcast will.

488
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,920
Comcast is no longer allow,
you know,

489
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:06,754
Blah Blah Blah.
The laugh app that has your podcast 

490
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:11,080
featured on it or you know,
some new streaming service.

491
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:13,900
It's yet to be discovered.
That will be in the future.

492
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,600
Challenging Youtube.
So youtube gets together with Google,

493
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,543
you know,
they're owned by Google and they get 

494
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:22,090
together with verizon and they make it 
exclusive for the verizon network.

495
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:25,600
If you want to get on youtube,
you have to be on the verizon network.

496
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,460
That's,
that's.

497
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,320
This is all inside the realm of 
possibility.

498
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,650
Fuck.
The deeper level though,

499
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:30,484
anybody who thinks that government has 
not been totally captured by 

500
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:35,920
corporations isn't paying attention.
I mean,

501
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:36,754
that's not news in this country.
You come from Europe where this is one 

502
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:40,924
of the things,
the problems I have with anarchists and 

503
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:42,774
Libertarians.
I think they're very naive about what 

504
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,100
the world would

505
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,350
look like if there were no government 
regulation.

506
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,213
Yeah,
I agree.

507
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,190
Every poison,
every river would be to poison,

508
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:53,570
to swim in it.
You know,

509
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,690
the air would be fucking because 
corporations,

510
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,553
it makes sense for them to dump their 
shit as near to the factory as possible 

511
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,823
and don't give a fuck about birth 
defects and dead people that it doesn't 

512
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:06,160
matter.
That's true.

513
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,660
But a lot of good things come from from 
that,

514
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,210
from a lot of anarchistic a theorists 
and and,

515
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,640
and some of those things.
Well,

516
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,553
I think a lot of it relates back to my 
shit with a hunter gatherers because 

517
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,390
hunter gathers are essentially anarchist
functioning anarchists.

518
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,480
The problem is when you scale up and 
you've got corporations that,

519
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,493
you know,
I've talked about this on this podcast 

520
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:27,374
before,
what my idea that my belief that 

521
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:32,720
corporations are living things,
institutions are living things and their

522
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,610
agendas conflict with like super 
organisms are.

523
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,523
Sounds Spooky.
I think that every time you get large 

524
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:40,184
groups of people together and they 
operate under one window or one 

525
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:42,914
umbrella,
rather,

526
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,820
they just tend to act like one organism.
Just what countries do.

527
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,270
I mean,
listen,

528
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,930
it's a natural thing that human beings 
do for some strange reason,

529
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:52,090
not only human beings,
right?

530
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,490
Think about flocks of birds and fish and
yeah,

531
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:59,270
and hills.
There are all sorts of examples and then

532
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:02,360
you go the other direction are,
are a microbiome,

533
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,423
you know,
I mean that's all functioning according 

534
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:06,560
to its own systems,
you know?

535
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:07,394
And then that's happening within us.
So there's all sorts of scalable stuff 

536
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:12,500
going on.
I think you'd be insane.

537
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:13,334
Did not think there needs to be some 
kind of structure to help things 

538
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,233
function smoothly.
But I think we all agree we don't need 

539
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:23,360
as much structure as we've got right now
and a lot.

540
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,920
But the problem is.
Sorry to interrupt,

541
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,323
just to finish the point,
I think what happens is a lot of people 

542
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:29,384
get in their heads and they start 
thinking that the state is responsible 

543
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:36,060
in some way or another for their 
wellbeing and that.

544
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:36,894
And that's what happens is you start 
forgetting that if what's really 

545
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:41,684
important is communities.
What's really important is finding a 

546
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:44,354
group of people that you love and 
deciding in this group of people 

547
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,140
loosely,
it's not a commune.

548
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:50,983
It's not like a cult,
but just deciding what the group of 

549
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:55,670
people that you have making this really 
intense decision,

550
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:58,400
which is none of us are ever going to be
homeless.

551
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,070
You could start there.
That used to be what the family was,

552
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:02,630
but a lot of people don't have that 
anymore.

553
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:03,464
So groups of people agreeing very 
loosely to take care of each other and 

554
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,943
in a way that the state is currently 
functioning with welfare and all that 

555
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:12,890
shit.

556
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,830
That's to me is like,
it's not anarchy,

557
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,530
but it's a.
it's a sense of soul,

558
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,493
like shrugging off the idea that the 
state is really going to take care of 

559
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:23,264
you,
but what if the state is an expression 

560
00:26:25,071 --> 00:26:28,730
of that sense of community as it is in a
country like Denmark for example,

561
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,950
were Danish people and Dutch people and 
Swedish people and you know,

562
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,720
lots of northern European countries 
said,

563
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,840
you know,
we're not gonna.

564
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:36,674
Let anyone be homeless and suffering.
We're not going to let any children be 

565
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:43,070
malnourished in this country.
We're going to take care of each other.

566
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,190
It depends on how

567
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,541
it.
It's.

568
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:46,710
If you're.
If there was a pure expression,

569
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,573
if for one,
if the people are unified enough to 

570
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:53,750
create a pure expression of what they,
what they're like central goals were,

571
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,810
that would be pretty startling to me,
but if we pay lip service to America all

572
00:26:57,811 --> 00:26:58,561
the time,
you know,

573
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:01,200
thanks for your service and we're all in
this together.

574
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:02,550
We're all Americans.
You know,

575
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:03,870
rally around the flag.
Yeah,

576
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:04,704
yeah,
yeah.

577
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,030
That's what we're doing.
We're,

578
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,850
we're trying to create this sense of 
community.

579
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:09,684
We're all in it together,
but when it comes to actually taking 

580
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,160
care of each other than we don't do it.
Well,

581
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:15,990
I mean that's to me.
I mean the list.

582
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,850
Let me say them as natively stupid 
thing.

583
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:19,140
I was just thinking about this in the 
way ever.

584
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:19,974
I mean this is so dumb,
but I was really thinking this because 

585
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:22,584
you know,
the prisoners are fighting the fires 

586
00:27:24,031 --> 00:27:24,631
right now,
you know,

587
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:27,000
that is that prisoners.

588
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,780
They're getting paid $1 an hour to fight
these fires were there.

589
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,763
It's fucking insane.
But I was just thinking to myself like 

590
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:35,700
dollar,
no $1 an hour.

591
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,220
But I was thinking to myself,
man,

592
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,870
what,
what if like everybody in California was

593
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:43,411
like,
shit,

594
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:48,280
there's fires and we all were going to 
help fight the fires would,

595
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,000
would we all be able to put the fires 
out?

596
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:51,834
Like if like as many just people just 
started flooding to actually go help or 

597
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,790
if like all these homes are burned down 
and I was just thinking like,

598
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,190
shit man.
If like everybody in California is like,

599
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:03,024
all right,
let's just go help them build their 

600
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:05,430
houses back.
I mean,

601
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:06,264
it's so insane,
but also fall apart if you are building 

602
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:10,730
a house,
trust will start building out.

603
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,630
They'd be like,
no,

604
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,560
nothing's done.
Nothing's the fuck did you do.

605
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,540
I wouldn't be in charge of the.

606
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,370
I wouldn't be in charge of building the 
fucking houses.

607
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,950
Like sandwiches.
I make sandwiches,

608
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,290
which is another cool thing that I like 
about.

609
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,124
I'm not saying by the way,
I'm not a fucking nras but one cool 

610
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:31,140
thing I like about the idea is like 
right now we have this hierarchy of uh,

611
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,020
you know,
of have like careers,

612
00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:37,710
right?
So doctors are valued more than somebody

613
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,910
who plumber,
plumber,

614
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,720
right?
Or plumbers are plumbers are valued more

615
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,910
than like,
I dunno,

616
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,660
a house cleaner or something.
So like,

617
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,703
you know,
it's considered a low status thing if 

618
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:51,870
you're somebody who works in a fast food
joint or something like that.

619
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:55,680
But when you get together with a group 
of people who are fucking cool,

620
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,250
some people are good at some things and 
some people are good at other things,

621
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,383
but nobody is valued more than the other
person because everybody loves each 

622
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:04,410
other.

623
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,870
And you've got this,
like what,

624
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,590
you know,
the person who's the most,

625
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,680
like somebody digging trenches to like 
put electrical wires down,

626
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,423
a pretty unskilled job is super 
appreciated because who the fuck wants 

627
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:21,450
to dig the trenches managed when you add
money to the equation,

628
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:23,610
which is what we're doing right now.
And I get it.

629
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,530
I'm not saying get rid of money or 
whatever.

630
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,170
When you add money to it,
everything gets fucking weird.

631
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,120
So what I'm saying is it's just a right 
now when we hear about the fires,

632
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,051
we think,
okay,

633
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:35,790
I'll donate some money,
I'll donate some money.

634
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,170
That'll,
that'll do it.

635
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:39,090
I'll donate some money.
But this is,

636
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,070
like I said before,
it's crazy naive.

637
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,160
I just had this image

638
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,420
of like,
fuck,

639
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:48,750
what if just huge groups of people 
started going towards the fires in blood

640
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:51,890
cells,
contaminants that.

641
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,903
Yeah.
Because right now we're using prisoners 

642
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,023
will do you understand the terrain?
Like this is not something that most 

643
00:29:57,221 --> 00:29:58,054
people can traverse.
You're talking about like extremely 

644
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:04,000
hilly areas that are also you.
You'd have to be not just fit,

645
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:06,430
but you'd have to understand which way 
the wind's blowing.

646
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:09,460
You could get shoe horned in and 
surrounded by fire.

647
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,000
There's a lot of like serious dangers 
with them.

648
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,440
It's a beautiful idea on paper.
We need trained.

649
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,760
There'd have to be like.
It would never.

650
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:18,590
I know it never fucking happen.
It's just clear.

651
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,070
You would need a lot of stuff.
Someone would have to organize.

652
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:26,100
It was supposed to be bigger than this 
than the city of Washington DC.

653
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,280
Now I know how big the fucking bad.

654
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,870
I mean it's insane how big it is.
It's terrible.

655
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,704
It's terrible.
You'd have to get a lot of fucking 

656
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:35,980
people to circle that bit,
but we're just so.

657
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,340
We're so.
We're so broken apart.

658
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:40,174
We're so disconnected.
Like whenever you hear about something 

659
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,100
going down,
it's just a thing that's going down.

660
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,100
If someone's house is burnt down,
your that fucking house burnt down,

661
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,323
that's it.
You don't really think much more than 

662
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:54,040
that and we think the state is going to 
come in and like take care of everything

663
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,360
and I think that's what the state wants.
I love using the term this state.

664
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,440
Does the state want that or is just how 
it's structured now at wants it,

665
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,323
but the state wants to because in the 
same reason anyone who's in an abusive 

666
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:07,894
relationship wants to be in control.
It's like if you think that I'm the one 

667
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,260
who's going to help you,
then you're dependent on me.

668
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:17,200
And do you think if the.
If there was a really effective,

669
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:21,250
massive volunteer firefighter force,
the state would resist that?

670
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,340
No,
I don't.

671
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,173
That's what's beautiful about it is I 
don't know how the state would resist 

672
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,184
that.
I mean we do see the state resisting 

673
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:31,720
things like groups of people getting 
together and trying to feed the homeless

674
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:33,060
and stuff like that.
Yeah.

675
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,700
Rather they resist last popups and you 
can't feed them like that.

676
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:41,140
There's a lot of licenses you need 
licenses to feed people.

677
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:43,360
You got to fill out forms baby.
But isn't that.

678
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,223
Would that be a good idea to prevent 
people from poisoning people or people 

679
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,160
giving them bad food or.
You know,

680
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,690
but I mean,
I don't know for sure man,

681
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,260
but when was the last time you heard 
about like an organized group like food?

682
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:57,094
Not Bombs poisoning.
Homeless people wouldn't have to be 

683
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:00,460
that.

684
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,510
It would be Duncan's food delivery 
service,

685
00:32:02,511 --> 00:32:05,770
so you just started out.
You might might have good intentions,

686
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:08,350
but not really be qualified to prepare 
food.

687
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,050
People are eating fucking hamburgers at 
a trashcan.

688
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,490
Definitely better than what they're 
eating.

689
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,353
For sure.
I know the real issue with homeless 

690
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:17,620
people is not just an economic issue 
though.

691
00:32:17,621 --> 00:32:21,250
The one of the big ones needs to be 
addressed as mental health and when they

692
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:23,320
changed the standards during the Reagan 
administration,

693
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:27,470
they essentially just sent people out on
the street and they were using Duncan.

694
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,970
The argument you're making basically,
which is that the state is providing for

695
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:32,020
people.
They should be.

696
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,210
There should be private church 
communities,

697
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:37,300
religious based families.
That was the argument they made.

698
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:40,220
I think it was disingenuous.
I think it was just about taking money.

699
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:40,810
Yeah.
No.

700
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,040
This is about giving it to the whole 
Reagan thing.

701
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:43,874
What we're seeing now is the fruit,
the bitter fruit of the Reagan 

702
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,264
Revolution.
They're still using the same economic 

703
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:50,330
arguments that's trickled down.
Shit.

704
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,410
Yeah.
That was started.

705
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,870
I most listeners probably aren't old 
enough to remember this,

706
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:57,160
but I remember in the eighties,
David Stockman was the,

707
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,560
the economic advisor did Ronald Reagan 
who came up with all this stuff.

708
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,650
Four or five years later,
he left the administration.

709
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:05,210
He came out and said that was all 
bullshit.

710
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,300
We knew it was bullshit.
It was just a story we made up.

711
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:10,970
It has makes no economic sense.
It's ruining the country.

712
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:12,950
I'm so sorry.
Jesus Christ,

713
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:13,784
you know,
and but they're still using it because 

714
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:18,330
it's a narrative that's effective.
The,

715
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,273
I'm getting into this a lot recently,
like how narratives are popular and 

716
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:28,070
powerful,
not because they make sense,

717
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,293
but because they create a story that 
justifies the power structure that's in 

718
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:35,420
control at the time.

719
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:36,731
Yeah.
Well,

720
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:37,320
I,
this is,

721
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,153
I,
this is why I think it's like hyper 

722
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:39,884
important right now for people to find 
groups of people that they love and do 

723
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,354
more than just like play board games,
like getting together with people and 

724
00:33:47,391 --> 00:33:50,270
like make stuff like face the facts.
Man.

725
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,313
Fucking California is on fire right now.
I mean everyone thinks this shit just 

726
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:56,990
stays the way it is.
It's not just on fire,

727
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:59,380
it's on fire in a way that you realized 
like,

728
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,253
oh,
it could be twice as bad as this and we 

729
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:02,654
would literally have to.
Everyone would have to flee the state 

730
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,170
and it's December.
Yeah,

731
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,700
this is the rainy season and it easily 
could be twice as bad as it is now.

732
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:11,534
We're just mean we're in a weird place 
and there's no rain in the rain is 

733
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,820
incoming.
Yeah.

734
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,770
And,
and you know,

735
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,910
like it sucks that people have to.

736
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:20,743
You have to create in your mind the 
reality of what's happening to my 

737
00:34:24,171 --> 00:34:25,010
friend.
You know,

738
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,173
he was sending me pics,
he was right by the fires and he's 

739
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:30,920
saying people just can't understand how 
bad this is.

740
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,690
People just can't comprehend it to 
people because this is,

741
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,130
this is,
this is like,

742
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,110
this is real life right now.
Do you guys feel like this,

743
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:44,210
for example,
and other things that are happening,

744
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,463
do you feel like this is the shit 
hitting the fan in a way that always 

745
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,180
seemed hypothetical?
You know,

746
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:51,014
like this is to me that we're living 
through a moment that's almost like 

747
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,160
aliens arriving in.
Like something that you always thought,

748
00:34:58,161 --> 00:34:59,360
well that would be weird.
Right?

749
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,240
It's happening.
It's happening right now.

750
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,453
It's like there are things happening now
that seemed inconceivable even five 

751
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:08,840
years ago,
10 years ago.

752
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,540
I don't know.
Like I remember what specific.

753
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:12,374
Well,
I mean like evacuate Santa Barbara on a 

754
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:15,764
few times that I've thought of.
Trump president is the main thing of 

755
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,680
course.
And like,

756
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:22,371
oh no,
these,

757
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:23,204
these national monuments were selling 
them to those mining company that now 

758
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:26,954
you know,
their lobbyists works for the heads of 

759
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:31,010
the Department of the interior and just 
like,

760
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,770
it's over like this.
We're reaching.

761
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
This is an end stage,
but you know,

762
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,290
hold.
I know what you mean.

763
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:38,010
And like God

764
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,320
knows like depending on how much,
how high I am,

765
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,780
my brain will get really shrill about,
fuck,

766
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:44,030
this is it man.
This is the end stage.

767
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,430
This fucking apocalypse happened man.
But man,

768
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,150
but then then when you go and look,
because I make some ketamine.

769
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:51,871
Well,
no,

770
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:52,704
like I had on my podcast recently,
he's said his story and the first 

771
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:57,510
question I asked him is this,
is this the end of the world?

772
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,520
And he's like,
I don't think so.

773
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,770
He's like,
you know,

774
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,793
they go into black plague,
wiped out like what 30 percent of the 

775
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:05,904
people on Earth got white.
Certainly Times that are filled with 

776
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:12,660
adversity and we're,
there's a restructuring.

777
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,800
Yeah,
it's the,

778
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,600
I don't mean it's the end of the world 
per se,

779
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:16,434
but it's the end of the American empire.
It's the end of America as a country 

780
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:22,850
that,
um,

781
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:23,743
other,
other people around the world looked up 

782
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:27,120
to as a,
as a model to be emulated.

783
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,103
Well,
we have a contest to see who controls 

784
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:30,504
the nukes and this is the first time 
that the popular guy fucked up what it 

785
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:36,210
is.
And this is the first time a popular guy

786
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:37,044
entered the popularity contest.
So who knows how to be popular and 

787
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:41,004
there's a bunch of people out there that
are pro wrestling fans and they bought 

788
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:44,220
right in Hook,
line and sinker.

789
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,233
And that's.
And that's a very simplistic version of 

790
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:48,624
it.
There's a lot of other people that 

791
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:49,614
wanted to throw a monkey wrench in the 
system because they thought Hillary 

792
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,870
Clinton was a crook and she probably is 
because they're all crooks.

793
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,180
There's most,
most of those people at the top,

794
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,000
or at least in some way fucked up.
Yes.

795
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,730
We have an opportunity to rebound.
Who Al Franken,

796
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:08,670
and I know Al Franken's just a but 
grabber and all things considered.

797
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,403
Did you read the last bit,
like the straw that broke the camel's 

798
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:12,550
back?

799
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,970
The last one where the veil said enough 
is enough.

800
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:17,510
It was in the Atlantic.
This woman or he put that.

801
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,340
She asked for a photo.
He put his arm around.

802
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:23,010
His hand was on her waist and schools 
are fat.

803
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,900
He squeezed her.
He.

804
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:27,870
She said he grabbed a handful of flesh,
which is a weird thing to say,

805
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,620
but he squeezed her at least twice is 
her quote.

806
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:32,454
At least twice.
He had his hand on her waist and she 

807
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:36,804
said,
I don't even let my husband touch me 

808
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:40,560
that way in public because it demeans me
as a professional woman.

809
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,480
Oh,
you're fucking kidding me.

810
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,213
Let's.
I'd like to interview her husband like 

811
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:48,040
you're not allowed to put your arm 
around your wife in public.

812
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,510
The squeezer my wife would love to be 
squeezed.

813
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:53,100
The more,
the more the merrier.

814
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,730
The idea of it is,
um,

815
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,673
it's very strange because that,
that one doesn't make sense to Leanne 

816
00:37:58,071 --> 00:37:59,670
tweet and one was the only one that made
sense.

817
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,100
He,
there's a photo of me.

818
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,030
She's unconscious.
It's demeaning,

819
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,850
I get the whole thing.
He apologized for that and rightly so.

820
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:09,510
And apparently he tried to kiss her but 
then the butt grab and it's like,

821
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:10,344
well,
he's definitely shouldn't be grabbing 

822
00:38:11,311 --> 00:38:12,600
people's Butts.
But I mean,

823
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:17,520
how much of a big deal is it also do 
have we stopped?

824
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,533
I mean,
Chelsea handler was on Bill Maher the 

825
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:20,274
other night and she said,
I have to believe these women because 

826
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:24,210
I'm a woman.
And I thought,

827
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,440
well,
wait a minute,

828
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,660
does that mean I have to believe all 
men?

829
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:28,494
Because I'm a man the isn't there any 
discussion about whether these things 

830
00:38:32,941 --> 00:38:35,040
are true or not?
[inaudible] Mia said this,

831
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,070
he said

832
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,903
he put it on twitter.
He goes saying all women are liars is 

833
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,490
just as crazy as saying all women tell 
the truth.

834
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,090
Right?
Well,

835
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:45,580
yeah.
I think a lot.

836
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,750
Franklin,
I don't know enough about Franklin,

837
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,140
but a lot of these people,
it's like,

838
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,630
like Weinstein wasn't like 40 people or 
something like that,

839
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,870
like 40.
I think when it starts getting up in the

840
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,490
and also what?
He's accused of it.

841
00:38:59,491 --> 00:38:59,870
Yeah.

842
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,703
In different things.
We're not talking about taking pictures 

843
00:39:02,231 --> 00:39:03,010
with people.
They were,

844
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:03,843
they like you.
They want to take a picture of you and 

845
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:06,430
you grabbed their waste.
We're talking about.

846
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,520
I mean he's been accused of rape by more
than one woman,

847
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:10,780
like actual rape,
rape.

848
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,440
Not just like getting someone drunk and 
having sex with them and be like holding

849
00:39:14,441 --> 00:39:17,150
them down type rape.
There was a lot of,

850
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,360
he's,
there's a lot of crazy.

851
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,450
See here's what's kind of fucked.
Um,

852
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,960
if prostitution was legal,
would that exist or is it a power thing?

853
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,293
Is it always a power thing?
Like does he want to have sex with the 

854
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:36,190
star of his films?

855
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,170
Because that's.
I think it's more a question of if,

856
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:44,470
if there weren't so many teenage boys 
who never got laid what with the society

857
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,084
look like,
and by this I don't mean to excuse 

858
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:49,304
anyone and I don't mean to say teenage 
girls should be more promiscuous or 

859
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:54,050
anything.
I'm just looking at objects.

860
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,390
I'm saying that guys like Harvey 
Weinstein,

861
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,460
that Dude didn't get laid in high 
school.

862
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,040
Most of the,
you look at these mass shootings,

863
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:04,550
a lot of these guys in their,
in their suicide notes say,

864
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,880
I'm doing this because I can't get laid.
I'm going to die a virgin.

865
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,100
That's the one begins.
Actually,

866
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,403
uh,
there's this a massive amount of 

867
00:40:13,071 --> 00:40:13,904
frustration that builds up because 
biologically most boys are horny little 

868
00:40:18,351 --> 00:40:22,010
monsters at 13 or 14.
They're not getting laid.

869
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,340
And so it gets to the point.
So there may be five,

870
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:32,360
six years between when a boy is totally 
obsessed with not just sex,

871
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:38,180
but with being acceptable to women being
loved by women being touched,

872
00:40:38,181 --> 00:40:42,920
being caressed being,
and they can't think about anything else

873
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:43,843
and they're not getting it.
And so I think a lot of boys grow up 

874
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:51,350
with extreme frustration that either 
curdles into misogyny,

875
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,430
where you get these,
like mass killers who,

876
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,790
who did they kill hookers,
right?

877
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,150
Sexually Liberated Free Women in their 
perspective.

878
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,840
And you get guys that just chase money 
their whole lives because they think the

879
00:41:02,841 --> 00:41:05,120
money and the power is going to get 
them,

880
00:41:05,121 --> 00:41:05,954
those women.
And so when they get to that place and 

881
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:10,400
they're still fucking disgusting and 
they,

882
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,970
they sense that the women don't even 
want to fuck them or they only fuck them

883
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,680
because they're going to get something 
from them.

884
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,740
Then there's all this self hatred and 
shame.

885
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,930
I think that's what's being expressed 
here.

886
00:41:20,931 --> 00:41:23,710
So I think it is power and I do think 
that it has a,

887
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,670
it's an,
it's an expression or a manifestation of

888
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:29,720
a deeply sex,
negative pathological culture.

889
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,823
Conversely,
how do you feel about like women that 

890
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:34,130
weren't attractive in high,
how come they don't lash

891
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,963
out at the same way?
They're not out there rape and did one 

892
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:42,040
becoming them down.
Women are much better at accepting their

893
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,913
sexual situation.
You see women have accepted a lot of 

894
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:48,350
shit that men are unable to accept for 
Millennia.

895
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,070
That's partly biological and probably 
partly cultural,

896
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,780
but also because,
I mean women can have sex.

897
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,140
Even women who aren't particularly 
attractive because the,

898
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:00,974
the,
the whole market is so skewed in the 

899
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:04,334
other direction.
Even women who aren't particularly 

900
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:10,550
attractive probably don't have much 
trouble getting laid in high school.

901
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,813
I don't think it's just that.
I think you're boiling it down to 

902
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,820
getting laid.
That's a reductionist thing.

903
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:21,821
I think it's way more,
but an unattractive woman who has a hard

904
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:24,140
time finding a boyfriend.
You know,

905
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,083
someone who loves her.
Someone who wants to be emotionally 

906
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:27,344
connected to her.
That probably is just as children full 

907
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:32,870
to a woman as a guy who can't find maybe
more painful.

908
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,910
Yeah.
Then a guy who can't find sex partner in

909
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,760
psychology,
they say that men express their,

910
00:42:37,761 --> 00:42:42,620
their these feelings through anger and 
women through depression and sadness.

911
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,493
Right?
So you probably don't see women lashing 

912
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:48,170
out and killing a bunch of dudes.
You see them being depressed and feeling

913
00:42:48,171 --> 00:42:49,130
like shit.
And when you do,

914
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:50,750
they have high testosterone.
That's why

915
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:55,170
another point to be made here is,
is that like,

916
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,910
you know,
people do say the thing,

917
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,250
oh well,
like people like Harvey Weinstein,

918
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,980
they wanted all this money to get laid,
but I don't,

919
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,913
I do not think that's it.
I think what people like Harvey 

920
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,950
Weinstein probably enjoy his power.
It's not like,

921
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,270
oh,
I want to get fucking laid.

922
00:43:12,271 --> 00:43:15,330
I'm going to become this massive.
It's like I like to dominate.

923
00:43:15,331 --> 00:43:18,420
I'm a dominating force.
That's what I am.

924
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:22,530
I'm going to.
I enjoy like having people around me who

925
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,800
worship me and as part of that I'm going
to dominate my interns.

926
00:43:28,261 --> 00:43:31,200
I'm going to dominate my employees and 
when I'm around women,

927
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,303
I'm going to use my.
I'm going to fucking jerk off and house 

928
00:43:34,751 --> 00:43:36,750
plants in front.
I mean,

929
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,230
it's like really fucking the ficus,
but you know,

930
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,340
you gotta you gotTa really think about 
that.

931
00:43:41,341 --> 00:43:42,360
It's like,
I don't,

932
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,650
I don't.
I know what you're saying.

933
00:43:43,651 --> 00:43:45,030
Oh,
poor Harvey Weinstein.

934
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:47,390
When he was fucking in front of the God 
damned with the.

935
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,450
He's saying,
well,

936
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,960
the thing of like he's not getting 
touched enough.

937
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:51,530
Well,
no,

938
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:51,891
no,
no,

939
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:52,724
but it's like this is the,
there's a lot of frustration that's 

940
00:43:55,491 --> 00:43:56,324
inherently connected to this suppressive
sexual culture that we find ourselves 

941
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:05,000
embroiled in that we don't necessarily 
agree with these fucking little boys.

942
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:05,811
Why are,
you know?

943
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:08,210
Because one,
that's the only access they have to.

944
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:10,130
They're less likely to tell on them.
And three,

945
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:13,670
there's self hatred.
I just recidivism.

946
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,440
I like to do a little thought 
experiment,

947
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,573
which is I like to imagine what,
where my head's gotta be if I jerk off 

948
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,120
into a house plant in front of somebody.
If you don't,

949
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,210
if you have tried that,
just just think about it.

950
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:29,240
Like where would you,
what's going on with you Christmas tree?

951
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:30,763
Yeah.
It might be like you're just 

952
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:31,983
celebrating.

953
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:41,100
He doesn't mind if you jerk off in the 
plant,

954
00:44:41,101 --> 00:44:43,930
the plants can absorb it and he's just 
leaving as dna all over the place.

955
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,810
It's really good for the planet.
Bet It is.

956
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:47,560
It's terrible for plants.
Not My.

957
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:51,120
Jim Weinstein is great for parents,
Bro.

958
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:55,323
Plants alive.
It's running for Senate Alpha Alphacam 

959
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:02,660
coming soon from onnit.
Joko you can really sell your com right?

960
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:09,210
I don't want anybody,
don't you think that all these things,

961
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:09,960
uh,
it's,

962
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,960
I think it's certainly this sex is not 
just a power thing because he's not just

963
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,990
exercising power.
He's exercising power in a sexual way.

964
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,400
Yeah.
It's not just power.

965
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:21,234
I think it's the game,
like we were talking about like 

966
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:26,640
corporations and even police officers 
and guys like Jeff sessions who have the

967
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,550
game to arrest people.
That is the game they play.

968
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:30,503
They get really good at it.
That's what the game is the game with a 

969
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:36,570
guy like him is,
I can't believe I get to fuck what's her

970
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:37,470
name,
know name,

971
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:42,471
famous actress and that famous actress 
is on her stomach and your mouth fucking

972
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,080
her.

973
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:43,913
Like,
Whoa,

974
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,780
really?
Is this really happening?

975
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,673
And it wasn't really happening.
It's happening because you're going to 

976
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:49,830
let her be cat woman or whatever the 
fuck the movie is.

977
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:50,664
Right?
Yeah.

978
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,240
There's some nuttiness to it.
There was some craziness.

979
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:56,520
There's some forbidden thing to it.
There's some,

980
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,430
there's a bunch of,
a bunch of things in play powers.

981
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:02,570
One of the dynamics,
it's just the most foul one because they

982
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,413
all the other ones like the sexual 
frustration and stuff doesn't seem so 

983
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:07,530
gross.
It's like when you,

984
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,271
when you,
you're,

985
00:46:08,271 --> 00:46:11,410
you're imposing your will on someone.
Then it's unquestionably an,

986
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,940
an expression of power.
Like once you were raping,

987
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:15,953
once you're coercing,
once you're imposing your will and 

988
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,640
you're saying,
I'm going to take away your career.

989
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:23,220
If you don't let me have sexual 
intercourse with you,

990
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:26,790
well then it's 100 percent power thing.
Like how did it get there?

991
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:31,200
There's a lot of things and I think 
you've got to get a lot of power.

992
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,001
I mean,
I,

993
00:46:32,001 --> 00:46:32,834
I guess I haven't exercised sufficient 
power in my life to know the answer to 

994
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,050
this question,
but does,

995
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,520
does dominance feel good directly or is 
it,

996
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,190
is it something that comes to you 
indirectly.

997
00:46:44,191 --> 00:46:45,024
So in other words,
does it feel good to dominate someone 

998
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:52,290
else or only because then you can get 
something that you want from them?

999
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,380
I think it's something that you want 
from them and I think there's also,

1000
00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:00,530
there's I think human beings are 
connected to each other in an undeniable

1001
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:01,764
way and I think that if you're 
exercising power over someone like say 

1002
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:09,060
if you hate to paint the scenario but 
just save you rape someone,

1003
00:47:09,061 --> 00:47:11,460
you were sexually attracted to someone 
you're loan with you and you raped them,

1004
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:14,670
and if you have any conscience at all,
if you,

1005
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:15,930
you know,
they're screaming no,

1006
00:47:15,931 --> 00:47:16,764
and you're still having sex with them 
and you come and then after what you 

1007
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:22,680
have to think about it like you would be
horrified at yourself.

1008
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,870
The level of self hatred would be almost
unimaginable.

1009
00:47:26,871 --> 00:47:29,380
Even posed yourself and your,
you're,

1010
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:31,060
you're,
you're twisted sickness.

1011
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,350
At the heart of that moment,
you know,

1012
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,090
the,
the,

1013
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:36,500
the,
the,

1014
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,190
the power dynamic.
Trying to impose the power.

1015
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:42,400
It can't possibly feel good.
I think it's just a thing.

1016
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,073
I think it's just a,
almost like a creepy leftover reptilian 

1017
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,060
instinct that,
that creatures have.

1018
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,500
Because if you look at rape in nature,
and this is not to exonerate,

1019
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:57,334
rapist is not to normalize rape,
but it's insanely common in the animal 

1020
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:02,740
kingdom,
right?

1021
00:48:02,741 --> 00:48:05,410
It's all.
It's common in ducks.

1022
00:48:05,411 --> 00:48:07,600
It's in common in all sorts of different
animals.

1023
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:09,853
Yeah.
Orangutans are ruthless and it's tough 

1024
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:12,244
because there are a lot of primatologist
are women and they learned the hard way 

1025
00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:18,850
from what I've heard,
that the always wear jeans.

1026
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,250
If you're working with Orangutans,
oh Jesus Christ,

1027
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,380
rape a tanks.

1028
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,580
That's awful,
but this,

1029
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,443
that this thing,
we're supposed to be evolved past that 

1030
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:30,100
and for the most part,
by far and above,

1031
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:30,934
we are right.
If you think about all these sexual 

1032
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:36,310
harassment interactions,
now imagine if they were chimps,

1033
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,140
you know,
I mean,

1034
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:42,040
imagine if they were a Rangataua was the
rape is the common thing.

1035
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,053
You could never have a bunch of a tanks 
in some sort of a building and people 

1036
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:46,351
would go,
well,

1037
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:48,160
of course we're better than a rank 
tanks.

1038
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,530
We are.
That's why we don't rape as much,

1039
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,933
but it is problematic to use the word 
rape when you're talking about animals 

1040
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:57,160
because part of it is that the way you 
described it,

1041
00:48:57,161 --> 00:48:57,994
that knowledge on some level that this 
female is totally not into what's 

1042
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:05,160
happening right now.
Whereas presumably Iranian,

1043
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:06,023
Tim doesn't have that knowledge and also
there are animals where the female is 

1044
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:15,211
triggered to ovulate by aggressive male 
behavior that we might call raping.

1045
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:16,750
Right?
Like rabbits.

1046
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:19,540
You bite the back of their neck and 
that's what makes the female ovulate.

1047
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,320
Well,
that's.

1048
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,470
There's a lot of weird stuff when it 
comes to women's w,

1049
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:24,343
what,
what is sexually attractive to certain 

1050
00:49:26,981 --> 00:49:30,520
women and what arouses them?
Rape fantasies is the number one.

1051
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,130
A lot of women like to be choked,
you know,

1052
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,420
like what's happening.
They're like,

1053
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:35,620
why?
Why do you like to be choked?

1054
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:36,483
Why do you like to get your arms pinned 
behind your back and why do you like to 

1055
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:41,380
fight back?
Like you actually like it.

1056
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:44,080
You want me to do that?
You want me to hold both your wrists?

1057
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,160
Okay.
You're sure,

1058
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,860
like there's a lot of tying up going on 
out there.

1059
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,030
There's really.
Yeah,

1060
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:49,864
there's a lot of people are.

1061
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,003
Yeah,
like this is all very strange stuff in 

1062
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:58,450
your apartment,
but here's the thing.

1063
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:02,190
When it comes to like s and M or bondage
at one,

1064
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,123
I think one of the big misconceptions 
when it comes to that is that if you're 

1065
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:09,610
being tied up or if you're tying 
somebody up there,

1066
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:12,850
there's like anger happening in that 
situation.

1067
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,330
It's one of the most sweet,
loving,

1068
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:19,090
trusting things that you can do for you.
It's the.

1069
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:19,924
It's really like,
I don't want to say full easily sell it 

1070
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,313
it.
It is.

1071
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,120
I've spent,
I spent a lot of time in dungeons.

1072
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:25,954
Actually.

1073
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,620
It's a healing sweet,
beautiful thing.

1074
00:50:32,621 --> 00:50:37,520
There's a difference between that and 
rough sex is very rich.

1075
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,540
I mean I personally find it not,
not.

1076
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,200
It doesn't turn me on at all largely 
because it's so choreographed.

1077
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,203
All the outfits and the this and now 
we're going to do that and safe words 

1078
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:52,163
and.
Yeah,

1079
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,940
but I mean I have been in those 
environments and as Duncan says,

1080
00:50:55,941 --> 00:50:56,774
it's,
it's like the opposite of out of 

1081
00:50:58,131 --> 00:51:00,590
control.
It's totally in control.

1082
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,490
Totally worked out the difference 
between a gun range and a war.

1083
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:14,600
So funny.
Well the last time I was at a gun range,

1084
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:17,300
I ended up bleeding from the head.
What happened?

1085
00:51:17,301 --> 00:51:20,030
I was with my buddy justin and we were 
shooting,

1086
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:22,920
this is up in Washington state where I 
was shooting his uh,

1087
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:28,190
remember what a 30,
30 or something and sculpt he had.

1088
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,640
He had this big elk gun that he was 
trying to scope in and he was like,

1089
00:51:31,641 --> 00:51:32,510
man,
I'm not like,

1090
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,523
you're shooting really well,
can you just take a shot at a few shots 

1091
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:36,260
on this and see if you.

1092
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:41,270
And I just grabbed it and didn't think 
that it was a totally different gun.

1093
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,610
Yeah.
And I just went boom in the scope,

1094
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:47,480
went right into my forehead.
All these macho dudes,

1095
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:47,860
you know,
I'm,

1096
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:52,860
I'm exposed as the idiot range.
We went to shoot at burnt down.

1097
00:51:53,091 --> 00:51:54,410
Did you hear about that?
No,

1098
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,090
I would imagine it did.
I would imagine it now.

1099
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:58,160
Well,
recently,

1100
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:01,670
yeah,
there's definitely fires in that area.

1101
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,533
I mean the fires are so out of control,
especially that out towards Santa 

1102
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:07,920
Barbara and Ventura,
Ventura,

1103
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:10,220
and that's the worst.
You know what I keep thinking?

1104
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:11,054
What if the fucking big one hits like 
shit's gonna catch on fire on the big 

1105
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:17,000
one heads and all the roads are going to
be fucked up.

1106
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,310
The infrastructure is going to be messed
up.

1107
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,510
That like this is like without a massive
earthquake.

1108
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:28,511
What happens if the big one hit right 
now all the water lines are broken.

1109
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,330
Trucks can't get there.
Yeah,

1110
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:33,860
yeah.
It could be a giant issue.

1111
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:36,350
Then you have toxic clouds and stuff 
too,

1112
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,540
because all these warehouses going.
Not only that,

1113
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:40,550
if the big one hits,
it's entirely likely.

1114
00:52:40,551 --> 00:52:43,040
It's not just going to hit here,
but it also hits in the ocean.

1115
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:48,140
Which case we get hit with a tsunami.
Which case all that super expensive real

1116
00:52:48,141 --> 00:52:52,880
estate in Malibu just gets wiped away.
I'm good up in Topanga though.

1117
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,630
Yeah,
you're probably,

1118
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,160
if you're not good up in Topanga.
We're really.

1119
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,170
Yeah,
we're fucked.

1120
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,880
Yeah.
You're like a canary in a coal mine.

1121
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,530
Calculate the planet,
leave it to me,

1122
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:08,003
dude.
Get back to the topic you're talking 

1123
00:53:09,741 --> 00:53:12,200
about.
It's the,

1124
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:13,373
what's the thing that's happening is 
people are realizing staff that nobody 

1125
00:53:17,391 --> 00:53:19,160
ever really wanted to talk.
Shit's changing.

1126
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:19,994
Like if you,
if you ever watched like porky's or if 

1127
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:23,600
you watch any of the movies from the 
seventies,

1128
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,190
like the makeout scenes,
like

1129
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,900
the guys are like,
come on baby,

1130
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,220
come in here.
What are you doing?

1131
00:53:29,221 --> 00:53:34,170
They're like throwing themselves on.
They're doing things in movies that were

1132
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:35,070
just considered like,
yeah,

1133
00:53:35,071 --> 00:53:36,870
that's how,
that's I guess that's how it's done.

1134
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:39,000
You're like,
you are forcing themselves.

1135
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:39,834
There's like scenes I think with like 
Bill Murray maybe or scenes in the old 

1136
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:45,180
movies with all so many of them.
Uh,

1137
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:47,520
pepe Le Pew,
you know what I mean?

1138
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,170
There's 100 percent right?
See,

1139
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:52,800
when you,
when you're seeing like this,

1140
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:55,290
like you're seeing much French.
Yeah,

1141
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:57,750
it's crazy when you go back and look and
you realize like,

1142
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:58,613
shit man,
what's happening is moves from the 

1143
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:01,434
fifties where the guy will just grab the
woman and things are changing is what's 

1144
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:08,031
happening.
And,

1145
00:54:08,031 --> 00:54:08,840
and,
and,

1146
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,710
and,
and as things change,

1147
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,500
like the two things we need to figure 
out,

1148
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,600
number one,
we have to admit like,

1149
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:16,680
yeah,
I get it man.

1150
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:17,543
Like,
you know,

1151
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:18,443
for me,
like hanging out with you doing the 

1152
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,820
podcast with you.
I know.

1153
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,693
Here's one thing I know man,
I'm pretty sure at least you don't want 

1154
00:54:27,661 --> 00:54:28,494
to fuck me.

1155
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:32,283
I'll tell he didn't look at me when he 
said it was just totally left out for 

1156
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,840
the chapter and your next book,
but you know,

1157
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:41,460
Research Duncan with,
with,

1158
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:45,030
with,
with what's happening with women is a.

1159
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,240
because a lot of dudes and I,
I'm sorry if this is a shocking thing to

1160
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:50,700
say,
a lot of dudes are in positions of power

1161
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:54,510
and what's happening with women is like 
who want to be actors.

1162
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:56,220
You're wanting whatever you want to like
do it,

1163
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:58,710
do stuff when they're getting around.
These guys,

1164
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,520
they don't have that assurance.
They're not like,

1165
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,120
this guy doesn't want to.
They're probably thinking this guy wants

1166
00:55:06,121 --> 00:55:09,240
to fuck me for these are women who most 
guys want to fuck.

1167
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:11,020
Yes.
So especially

1168
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,290
if you're talking about Harvey 
Weinstein,

1169
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:14,040
these hot actresses,
right?

1170
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,120
The,
the real.

1171
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:18,100
The strange thing is you have that 
unquestionably.

1172
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:18,993
Yeah,
and then you have women that want to 

1173
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:24,550
have nothing to do with that part of the
business.

1174
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,280
They don't.
They're not trying to be seductive,

1175
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:29,590
they just want to work.
They want to act,

1176
00:55:29,591 --> 00:55:31,180
and then they have to deal with all this
bullshit.

1177
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:33,700
That's it.
But then you've got women who sneak into

1178
00:55:33,701 --> 00:55:37,300
that mix and they're willing,
not only they willing,

1179
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:40,940
they're manipulative and they're 
seductive and they.

1180
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,520
They're trying to make their way up the 
ladder.

1181
00:55:42,521 --> 00:55:45,340
That way they exist there.
It's a much smaller percentage,

1182
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:46,323
but they exist to make sure that their 
whole society is set up to make women 

1183
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:53,440
think that the only thing they have to 
trade is their sexuality.

1184
00:55:53,441 --> 00:55:54,274
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with these women agreeing to do a film 

1185
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,220
with not even Harvey Weinstein.
Anyone.

1186
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,173
And then he says,
I'll give you more parts if you fucked 

1187
00:56:03,521 --> 00:56:04,900
me.
And the girl wants to do it.

1188
00:56:04,901 --> 00:56:05,734
And she does it.
Like,

1189
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,250
I think it's gross,
but it's not gross.

1190
00:56:09,251 --> 00:56:11,200
It's not gross to her.
Do you know what I'm saying?

1191
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,180
It's.
It's a weird thing.

1192
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,193
It's only grows if it's gross.
It's gross being around a guy like 

1193
00:56:18,191 --> 00:56:19,240
Harvey Weinstein.
Right.

1194
00:56:19,241 --> 00:56:22,510
If he's yelling at people and he's fat 
and sweating all over the place,

1195
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,620
it's.
Yeah.

1196
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,040
Unless

1197
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,860
it's not gross.
Unless you like that kind of guy.

1198
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:28,540
Right?
Like you might bears.

1199
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,890
Yeah.
Because they're into bears.

1200
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,170
Might you might like that.
Yeah.

1201
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,030
Right.
So at what point are we.

1202
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,420
Are we taking away women's agency when 
we say that?

1203
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:38,254
That should never be.
You shouldn't be able to give a guy a 

1204
00:56:39,971 --> 00:56:42,160
blow job and get a part in a movie.
It's weird.

1205
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:42,994
Right?
It's like you should be able to pay for 

1206
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:45,694
things,
but you shouldn't be able to pay for 

1207
00:56:47,051 --> 00:56:49,990
things with sex.
Why not?

1208
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:51,363
That's George Carlin's things.
You can buy things when you can have 

1209
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:55,000
sex,
but you can't buy sex.

1210
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:56,063
Like it's strange.
It's strange because I don't think it's 

1211
00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:04,540
necessarily illegal in a barter sense.
Like say it to you dinner,

1212
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:09,990
like say if you had some woman and she 
wanted to paint your house,

1213
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:16,420
but in it is a bad example or you wanted
to paint her house,

1214
00:57:16,421 --> 00:57:17,620
how about this?
She wants you to pay it,

1215
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:21,340
they're going to pay you but I will suck
your Dick and you're like,

1216
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,280
okay,
that's a deal.

1217
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,260
Like that seems like a good deal.
Like you want to do that?

1218
00:57:26,261 --> 00:57:26,771
And she's like,
yeah,

1219
00:57:26,771 --> 00:57:27,604
I want to do I want to talk to your dad 
because I also want you to paint my 

1220
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:31,270
house.
I mean look at some girl.

1221
00:57:31,271 --> 00:57:32,104
It depends on who it is.
It's Angelina Jolie and she's 25 to be 

1222
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:35,730
out there with the fucking roller.

1223
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,513
You just be thinking.
I was going to take a long time to 

1224
00:57:41,231 --> 00:57:42,064
finish though.
I like if you're both into it and this 

1225
00:57:44,171 --> 00:57:45,090
is exempt.
And again,

1226
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,140
again I have to be super clear about 
this,

1227
00:57:47,141 --> 00:57:50,980
but I'm not exonerating rape or sexual 
harassment or predatory behavior.

1228
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:51,933
What I am saying is we have a weird.
It's weird that we separate commerce 

1229
00:57:57,191 --> 00:57:58,024
from intimacy when it comes to sex and 
it's the only type of intimacy you can 

1230
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:04,420
get massaged in your underwear.
I do it all the time where women will be

1231
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:05,920
talking to me about,
you know,

1232
00:58:05,921 --> 00:58:08,530
well,
my kids go into school at this place and

1233
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:11,620
he really likes wrestling,
but the problem is they're discontinuing

1234
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:12,880
the program and while they're doing 
that,

1235
00:58:12,881 --> 00:58:15,280
she's digging her elbow and my back and 
I'm in pain,

1236
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:16,263
but I'm,
I'm in my underwear or alone in a room 

1237
00:58:18,071 --> 00:58:18,904
with this lady and I'm having a nice 
conversation with her while she's being 

1238
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:21,820
intimate with me.

1239
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,650
I mean,
that's essentially what's going on.

1240
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,613
There's oil involved,
they're massaging neck and it feels 

1241
00:58:26,891 --> 00:58:27,724
really good.
It's don't shoot any fluid out of your 

1242
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:32,920
body.
We allow that to get a woody when you're

1243
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:33,930
getting a massage.
Uh,

1244
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,980
it definitely moves.
I'm trying to stay calm and zen though I

1245
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:39,070
put myself in,
in a peaceful place.

1246
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,470
Fucking worse.
When your deck starts getting harder and

1247
00:58:41,471 --> 00:58:43,420
they're getting a platonic massage and 
you're like,

1248
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:48,700
what were like preparing your apology?
But it's because being touched.

1249
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:51,630
We're also touched a starved.
Yeah.

1250
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:55,000
You know,
in this society that I think people have

1251
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:55,834
a hard time distinguishing between 
pleasant touch and eroticism or between 

1252
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,220
good sex and love.
You know,

1253
00:59:03,221 --> 00:59:06,370
we mix it all together because we were 
so unfamiliar with it.

1254
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,813
There's also,
there's would be levels to prostitution 

1255
00:59:09,731 --> 00:59:13,000
to right,
like what would be a peek ahead buddy.

1256
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,373
You don't have to tell us what would be 
the problem with someone who say was a 

1257
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:22,040
woman who just did not have

1258
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,350
a desire to have a family like to 
freedom.

1259
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:25,423
Didn't want to work a regular job,
but she likes having sex with men that 

1260
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:29,660
she likes.
So she picks a few men.

1261
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:34,930
Maybe she's got a small roster of like 
10 guys who fucker and they rotate.

1262
00:59:35,331 --> 00:59:36,200
No,
you can do Tuesday.

1263
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:37,940
Mike's doing Tuesday.
Okay.

1264
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:39,500
Wednesday.
Yeah,

1265
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:40,334
Wednesday at work.

1266
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:42,490
This is happening.
There's a lot of this.

1267
00:59:42,491 --> 00:59:45,680
I just was visiting with a friend of 
mine who does this real.

1268
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:46,900
Yeah,
there's a website,

1269
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,930
I forget what it's called.
It's not friends with benefits,

1270
00:59:49,931 --> 00:59:50,764
but it's their websites and there's a 
whole name for these sugar daddies and 

1271
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,720
sugar daddy sites where the guys now 
it's like,

1272
00:59:58,721 --> 00:59:59,291
okay,
look,

1273
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:01,450
we're gonna.
And the way she described it was,

1274
01:00:01,451 --> 01:00:02,890
there's no,
it's no set price.

1275
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,350
It's not like a thousand bucks to fuck 
me or whatever.

1276
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:06,184
It's,
it's like we get together if I like you 

1277
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:09,280
have dinner,
whatever.

1278
01:00:09,281 --> 01:00:10,114
And Yeah.
And then you want to get together again 

1279
01:00:11,021 --> 01:00:11,950
next weekend.
Okay,

1280
01:00:11,951 --> 01:00:13,950
you want to take me to Malibu?
Okay,

1281
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:18,700
we'll go to Malibu and then his money 
showing up in my accounts or not.

1282
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:20,043
And if it's not then I'm deciding do we 
want to keep seeing this dude for 

1283
01:00:22,811 --> 01:00:24,340
nothing,
you know?

1284
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,720
Or it was 150 bucks,
you know?

1285
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:27,983
And then it's like,
and she's like different guys depending 

1286
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:31,003
how much money they have,
they give her more or less and so she 

1287
01:00:33,431 --> 01:00:34,264
can just decide at anytime.
She wants to continue the relationship 

1288
01:00:36,821 --> 01:00:38,950
and she doesn't consider herself a 
prostitute.

1289
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:41,950
And you go to someplace like Thailand.
It's,

1290
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:43,323
I met this dude in Nepal years ago who 
explained to me the whole do the whole 

1291
01:00:46,571 --> 01:00:49,060
deal because I've spent a lot of time in
Thailand,

1292
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:53,050
but I've never been able to wrap my head
around and I was Horny as hell,

1293
01:00:53,051 --> 01:00:57,150
but I couldn't wrap my head around the 
thing and how it worked because,

1294
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:59,140
you know,
getting back to your rape thing,

1295
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:00,003
to me the most demeaning experience in 
the world would be to find myself in a 

1296
01:01:04,991 --> 01:01:08,380
sexual situation and realize that the 
woman doesn't want to be there.

1297
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:09,260
You know?

1298
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,210
It's like,
oh my God,

1299
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:12,070
that's just like,
I feel so ugly,

1300
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:12,923
you know,
so to be with a Thai woman and there's 

1301
01:01:14,981 --> 01:01:19,750
all this confusion and she doesn't.
She's acting like she wants to do this.

1302
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,550
Anyway,
this guy explained to me,

1303
01:01:21,551 --> 01:01:25,090
he goes to Thailand,
there's a woman he knows there.

1304
01:01:25,091 --> 01:01:25,924
If she's not around,
she'll hook them up with a friend of 

1305
01:01:27,371 --> 01:01:28,204
hers,
but basically he'll travel with her for 

1306
01:01:30,611 --> 01:01:33,670
a month or to take her all over 
Thailand.

1307
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:34,623
She translates,
she gets them better deals on rooms and 

1308
01:01:37,271 --> 01:01:39,580
food and everything.
She knows what to order,

1309
01:01:39,581 --> 01:01:42,340
and Thailand is very cool about 
prostitution.

1310
01:01:42,341 --> 01:01:45,760
It's Buddhist that doesn't have this 
anti sex thing that we have,

1311
01:01:45,761 --> 01:01:48,100
so it's no big deal,
right?

1312
01:01:48,101 --> 01:01:51,280
As far as the Thai people are concerned.
And um,

1313
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:54,820
and at some point on that trip,
they'll go to the village where she grew

1314
01:01:54,821 --> 01:01:58,870
up and they'll meet her family and he'll
be like,

1315
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,190
hey,
your mother's refrigerators looking kind

1316
01:02:01,191 --> 01:02:03,160
of old.
Is she needed a new refrigerator?

1317
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:04,420
Oh,
that would be great.

1318
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:07,390
And they go buy a refrigerator and give 
it to the mother and the mother.

1319
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,100
Super happy.
And that's the,

1320
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:12,250
that's it.
There's no money changing hands.

1321
01:02:12,251 --> 01:02:13,084
It's a gift.
So it's very much like what you're 

1322
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:17,260
describing.
It's and sex.

1323
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:19,410
It's not for the sex.
There's sex,

1324
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:20,220
there's friendship,

1325
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,053
there's translation,
there's saving me money and telling me 

1326
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:25,410
the best places to go.
That's like a guide.

1327
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,250
And sex is just part of that.
It's a very,

1328
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:30,000
it's,
it's,

1329
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,150
it's hard to conceive from our cultural 
perspective,

1330
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:35,850
uh,
that it actually works that way.

1331
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:36,743
I don't think there would be anything 
wrong with a woman deciding to have sex 

1332
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:40,374
with a bunch of men for money.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

1333
01:02:42,361 --> 01:02:43,194
with it or I think the real is comes 
into having sex with somebody you don't 

1334
01:02:45,331 --> 01:02:46,450
know.
Right.

1335
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,333
You know,
if you're a street walker and some guy 

1336
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:50,970
picks you up and wants to kill you,
that's the real danger.

1337
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:51,983
The real danger is not in your clientele
unless of course one of them is a 

1338
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:58,020
fucking psycho,
but I think can happen on a tinder date.

1339
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,210
Yeah,
I think we are.

1340
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:04,380
We're operating under the echoes of the 
puritans and uh,

1341
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,130
I think as grown adults deep into our.

1342
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:08,680
I mean,
I'm,

1343
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,840
I'm,
I'm 50 now.

1344
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,280
How old are you?
Fifty five.

1345
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:15,120
The idea that we're still under and 
you're 43.

1346
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:19,740
Imagine being under this.
The whims of some people who died,

1347
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,780
you know,
hundreds of years ago,

1348
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:24,660
had a complete ignorance to human 
psychology,

1349
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:27,990
to physiology,
to sexual urges to genetics.

1350
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:29,143
They did.
What they knew then is literally 

1351
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:34,750
flavoring the way we behave today.
It's so insanely suppressive.

1352
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,593
It's good point.
I also have a point about all this 

1353
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,383
sexual harassment stuff that's 
uncomfortable and this is those 

1354
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:45,324
environments become your world.
If you're in an office eight hours a 

1355
01:03:49,321 --> 01:03:51,690
day,
that is most of your day.

1356
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:55,050
Yeah.
Most of your waking conscious day you're

1357
01:03:55,051 --> 01:03:55,884
spending in this one area and people,
they start behaving like that's the 

1358
01:04:00,691 --> 01:04:04,650
world and you start becoming sexually 
attracted to the people that are in your

1359
01:04:04,651 --> 01:04:07,950
world and some people reciprocate and 
some do not.

1360
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:08,903
Some people are frustrated and some are 
not and some people are gross and 

1361
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:12,474
they're in a position of power in that 
weird world and I think maybe that guy 

1362
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:18,390
wouldn't sexually harassed in the big 
world,

1363
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,553
but in this little world where 
everything's jammed in together and you 

1364
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:22,644
have these clearly defined things like 
this guy has got a plaque on his desk 

1365
01:04:25,231 --> 01:04:26,970
that says the boss.
Right,

1366
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,770
and you got to come in and he's got the 
desk.

1367
01:04:28,771 --> 01:04:30,030
Come on and shut the door.
Shut the door.

1368
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,073
Or if you like Matt Lauer,
you've got a button where you lock the 

1369
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:34,140
door,
click fuck.

1370
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:34,891
Come on.
Inside.

1371
01:04:34,891 --> 01:04:37,290
We've got to discuss.
We've got to review your progress.

1372
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:39,870
This click,
this is the world,

1373
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:41,940
I mean,
I'm not exonerating.

1374
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:43,500
Matt Lauer can't believe I'd say the 
scan,

1375
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:46,500
but if you're in that guy's world and I 
don't even know what he did,

1376
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:47,430
I didn't pay attention.

1377
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:50,250
I met him once.
He was quite a gentleman,

1378
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:54,030
but he's in this.
He's got to be working 10,

1379
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:56,460
12 hours a day.
You're doing the today show.

1380
01:04:56,790 --> 01:04:59,340
It's insanely competitive that morning 
TV thing.

1381
01:04:59,341 --> 01:05:01,590
You have to be on the ball,
you have meetings,

1382
01:05:01,591 --> 01:05:04,050
you have fucking stuff to review.
You have guests.

1383
01:05:04,051 --> 01:05:08,130
Are you going to review your performance
in your conversations with people and.

1384
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:08,820
Well,
Matt,

1385
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,290
you know,
whenever you start talking about sex,

1386
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:11,460
people drop off.
Look,

1387
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:14,100
we've got the numbers.
We have the chart in the direct relation

1388
01:05:14,101 --> 01:05:17,010
to what you were saying earlier is what 
I read about Matt Lauer was,

1389
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:17,950
uh,
he,

1390
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:18,250
he

1391
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,083
couldn't have sex with a,
just normal people because he's famous 

1392
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:23,230
and he's,
you know,

1393
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:24,063
he'd get in trouble and he's married.
So he had to maintain the facade of 

1394
01:05:26,711 --> 01:05:27,544
that.
He and he couldn't have sex with other 

1395
01:05:29,321 --> 01:05:31,570
famous people because that would come 
out into the press.

1396
01:05:31,571 --> 01:05:33,640
So he had to have sex with people who 
weren't famous,

1397
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:35,950
they weren't just normal people.
And that left the office.

1398
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:37,383
That was it.
So imagine if we lived in a world where 

1399
01:05:39,851 --> 01:05:41,740
we said,
who gives a shit if Matt Lauer's fucking

1400
01:05:41,741 --> 01:05:43,800
someone other than his wife,
that's between them.

1401
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:44,650
The sixties,
again,

1402
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:46,643
this,
I don't know that that was back when 

1403
01:05:48,461 --> 01:05:50,510
Dustin Hoffman was grabbing titties 
acute,

1404
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,230
and if you guys ever seen,
by the way last,

1405
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:56,020
sorry the last word on this for me 
anyway,

1406
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:57,363
the people who are acting shocked and 
outraged around Matt Lauer and Charlie 

1407
01:06:00,341 --> 01:06:02,700
rose are full of shit.
That's what.

1408
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,633
That's what kills me.
The hypocrisy of the people who've been 

1409
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:08,060
working with them for years and going,
oh,

1410
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,083
I had no idea.
I heard about Charlie rose being a 

1411
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:14,560
fucking creep 15 years ago and I don't 
even work in media.

1412
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:17,140
You know,
it's like the bill cosby thing.

1413
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:19,850
Open the bill cosby thing was an open.

1414
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:21,920
Have you see?
Have you guys seen this?

1415
01:06:21,921 --> 01:06:22,754
Is one of the grossest things you can 
witness in a workplace is when the boss 

1416
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:30,080
starts giving fucking neck rubs.
You ever seen that?

1417
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:31,243
A neck rub and boss though it is,
it is so fucking creepy to watch a big 

1418
01:06:38,211 --> 01:06:42,980
fat fucking boss saddling up behind some
married secretary.

1419
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,073
Just so how are you doing the day carol 
rubbing her neck and she could see the 

1420
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:51,620
look on her face frozen.
She's got kids.

1421
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:53,690
She's.
If she says to him,

1422
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,400
Hey,
do you mind?

1423
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:57,290
I don't really want you to touch me 
right now.

1424
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,760
He's going to be,
oh,

1425
01:06:58,761 --> 01:07:03,260
I'm sorry,
but then she doesn't know down the line,

1426
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:05,930
down the line when he's doing employee 
reviews and he's thinking,

1427
01:07:05,931 --> 01:07:07,790
you know what?
Ruin that fucking time.

1428
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:09,620
I just wanted to rub her back,
man,

1429
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,340
but I'm not rubbing any of the dudes 
backs in the office.

1430
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:18,470
Now that man that is fucked up.
That is one of the sleaziest slimy.

1431
01:07:18,471 --> 01:07:22,580
His things and to imagine when you're 
the boss,

1432
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:25,880
to imagine that these bosses,
they're oblivious,

1433
01:07:25,881 --> 01:07:26,714
they just don't know.
They just want to give them that 

1434
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:29,630
corrupts.
They're not aware like come on.

1435
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:32,900
They can feel that it is.
He's rubbing their back.

1436
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:33,883
If you can't feel their fucking.
Adam's trying to escape your sweaty God 

1437
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,780
fucking male.
Dominator.

1438
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:42,913
How many guys become friends with women?
Have Air tag friends just so they just 

1439
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:48,734
creep and closer,
almost like your stock and big game and 

1440
01:07:51,261 --> 01:07:55,460
you want to just move real close to flow
and that's what they're doing.

1441
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:58,190
One of the classics.
That's how I hunt elk.

1442
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,420
I walk real slow.
Give it an echo now.

1443
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:04,010
Don't give it a try not to make my 
intentions known.

1444
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:07,190
That is what's happening in these 
environments.

1445
01:08:07,191 --> 01:08:09,410
I think when people work in offices 
together,

1446
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,440
they get attracted to each other.
Whitney.

1447
01:08:12,441 --> 01:08:14,690
Cummings has a fucking hilarious bit 
about it.

1448
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:16,130
I won't.
I won't do

1449
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,360
it justice.
I'm not going to say it,

1450
01:08:17,361 --> 01:08:20,090
but she talks about working in an office
because she's,

1451
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:21,650
you know,
she works on Rosanne.

1452
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:24,320
She's on.
She's on the staff,

1453
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,510
like she's in an office all the time.
She's like,

1454
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,793
this is what people do that it's this 
weird environment and office romances 

1455
01:08:31,701 --> 01:08:36,690
are fucking.
There's so calm and they're so common.

1456
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:40,040
Plus together they're going to be 
attractive and if you're.

1457
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:40,913
If you're married to some guy and he 
said he's the big boss and it says that 

1458
01:08:43,471 --> 01:08:44,304
on his breastplate,
the big boss and the big pause as a 

1459
01:08:45,931 --> 01:08:46,764
secretary with the big ass and big tits 
and she's friendly and he's alone with 

1460
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:53,640
her all day,
all day,

1461
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,830
all day,
every day,

1462
01:08:56,130 --> 01:09:01,130
every week and she's calling it home 
because she's on top of the appointments

1463
01:09:01,411 --> 01:09:03,280
and she's made.
Is his playing.

1464
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:05,760
Oh,
I have Mike's flight arrangements.

1465
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:07,510
I just wanted to call it and the wife 
has to listen.

1466
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:08,363
Listen to this bitch

1467
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,333
hanging out there.

1468
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:15,860
They slowly taking her power away,
socking away her influence until one day

1469
01:09:16,621 --> 01:09:18,810
can't take it anymore and he's like,
you know,

1470
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,673
just fucking.

1471
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:22,510
Is it home?
If Carol was like you,

1472
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:25,690
Carol doesn't understand me.
Carol is just such a bitch to me.

1473
01:09:25,691 --> 01:09:28,700
Sometimes it's,
it's crazy because you give her so much.

1474
01:09:28,701 --> 01:09:31,490
She provide her so much.
She,

1475
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,690
she doesn't know any woman who want to 
be in Carol's place.

1476
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,553
You know me.
You work with Carol doesn't understand 

1477
01:09:38,351 --> 01:09:39,970
me.
Next thing you know,

1478
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:40,804
you've got the sexual novelty kicking in
when he's been banging carol for 15 

1479
01:09:44,171 --> 01:09:45,280
years.
They got kids,

1480
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:48,580
they got a mortgage,
they've got a big ass.

1481
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:52,140
Yeah,
to Nice.

1482
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:56,440
That nice with Ruby red lipstick and her
long nails.

1483
01:09:56,650 --> 01:10:00,280
Well it's fucking.
The whole thing is just like I've office

1484
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:01,143
fucking and all that.
Just like the whole thing is kind of 

1485
01:10:03,221 --> 01:10:06,490
unsavory.
But like the and yeah,

1486
01:10:06,491 --> 01:10:07,810
for sure.
Office Romances,

1487
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,120
I hope they do happen.
Hope everyone in the office is,

1488
01:10:10,121 --> 01:10:12,010
is happily fucking all day long.

1489
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,930
That's glory.
But man,

1490
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:16,120
when you think about that much work 
done,

1491
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:20,890
when you think about fucking being 
denise and who's this dude's name?

1492
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,350
That Guy Mike.
Mike,

1493
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:23,960
Mike,
Tara.

1494
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:24,913
When you're fucking didn't hear denise 
and you got this job and there's Mike 

1495
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,720
and Mike is a fucking asshole man.
Mike is not.

1496
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,010
You're not as different story than my 
story.

1497
01:10:36,011 --> 01:10:36,800
Yeah.
No,

1498
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,830
I thought Mike just had a lot of 
responsibility,

1499
01:10:38,831 --> 01:10:42,610
but I thought mix a big burly guy maybe 
eat a little too much and drank a little

1500
01:10:42,611 --> 01:10:43,444
too much company or sanitation motto.
Lot of work responsibility and Mike 

1501
01:10:47,621 --> 01:10:49,520
smells like fucking onions.
It's far.

1502
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:52,710
It's or like his mind.
It's farts are just fucking hell.

1503
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:55,960
A should see denise's ex husband,
man.

1504
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:57,603
Denise has a kid,
has a kid with a guy who was a real 

1505
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:04,090
piece of shit.
I'm saying what's happening right now,

1506
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:05,343
right now,
what's happening is there's been a lot 

1507
01:11:06,881 --> 01:11:09,310
of fucking slimy massages that have been
going on.

1508
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:12,850
I'm going to guess for about 5,000
years.

1509
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:13,684
There's been a lot

1510
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:18,750
more than 20,000
years is slimy massages.

1511
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:19,823
It's been building up like the fucking 
yellow stone super called there and in 

1512
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:26,760
the fucking like epigenetic Dna of 
women.

1513
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:30,030
There is probably somewhere in coded in 
there,

1514
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,073
just millennia of creepy fucking 
massages that don't stop with the 

1515
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:37,890
fucking massage depending on what time 
period you're in.

1516
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:38,933
You know,
and so I think that what we're feeling 

1517
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:45,291
right now is the result of generations 
of creepy fucking massages and much,

1518
01:11:48,661 --> 01:11:51,060
much worse happening.
And women are like,

1519
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:53,160
fuck this,
this fucking sucks.

1520
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:54,203
We're sick of it.
We're fucking sick of your creepy 

1521
01:11:56,131 --> 01:11:58,740
massages and that's what it is.
And some women,

1522
01:11:58,890 --> 01:11:59,910
I mean,
imagine man,

1523
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,013
I've.
There's one time at a blockbuster video 

1524
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:06,400
used to work at a blockbuster video.
And My boss was this like,

1525
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:07,853
just a,
a sleazy fucking like just a slimy 

1526
01:12:10,531 --> 01:12:12,300
fucking gay dude.
I didn't like him.

1527
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,350
He made his clean the video tapes when 
they didn't need to be cleaned.

1528
01:12:15,351 --> 01:12:16,081
It's like,
come on man,

1529
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:19,260
these tapes are clean spray and fucking 
videotapes down.

1530
01:12:19,261 --> 01:12:22,170
I remember late at night,
he,

1531
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:22,920
we,
we,

1532
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,050
there's like the area where the cash 
register is,

1533
01:12:25,051 --> 01:12:27,770
is this closed off cubicle place?
I'm,

1534
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:30,180
I'm down.
I'm down on my fucking knees,

1535
01:12:30,181 --> 01:12:31,014
man.
Having to get something from underneath 

1536
01:12:31,891 --> 01:12:32,724
there.
And this dude like hops up on the 

1537
01:12:34,411 --> 01:12:38,880
fucking counter and he stretches his 
legs out in front of me.

1538
01:12:38,881 --> 01:12:41,520
He's like,
spread eagles is fucking legs out.

1539
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:45,660
So like blockbuster khaki pants on 
curling up.

1540
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:49,860
But you could see the outline of his 
fucking boss balls in there and,

1541
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:51,350
and like.
And he's like,

1542
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:53,760
he's like,
you got.

1543
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,760
I mean he's,
he never.

1544
01:12:56,850 --> 01:13:01,850
There was nothing more unappealing than 
boss balls accentuated by Khaki.

1545
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,640
And you're looking up there and he's 
looking down at you.

1546
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:06,623
That power has been accentuated.
He's looking down at you and he's just 

1547
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:12,690
saying you did a good job today.
He did a good job today,

1548
01:13:12,691 --> 01:13:14,940
Duncan,
and I'm like thinking like,

1549
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:16,103
this is fun.
This is truly got to be one of the 

1550
01:13:18,571 --> 01:13:20,770
circles of fucking hell right now 
because like,

1551
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:25,130
this dude is hitting on me right now.
I'm getting paid minimum.

1552
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:29,070
You for sure dude.
His legs are spread.

1553
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,900
I don't know.
Can I put it in just doing you?

1554
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,771
Can I prove it?
Yeah,

1555
01:13:31,771 --> 01:13:32,604
for right.
I don't even think people were doing 

1556
01:13:33,511 --> 01:13:35,790
yoga in North Carolina at this time.
If he was a woman,

1557
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:36,624
you would assume that those actions 
would indicate that she would want 

1558
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:39,174
sexual intercourse.
I'm saying there was a feeling now 

1559
01:13:41,221 --> 01:13:43,110
whether I could prove it or whether it 
was just me or whatever.

1560
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,100
Oh,
what?

1561
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:45,320
Oh,
twenties.

1562
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,420
I don't know,
but there was a feeling that this sucks,

1563
01:13:48,421 --> 01:13:50,130
man.
There's more going on here.

1564
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:51,060
Right?
This sucks.

1565
01:13:51,061 --> 01:13:52,800
That's.
Is it a legal.

1566
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:53,551
Is it like,
could I.

1567
01:13:53,551 --> 01:13:55,660
is it even sexual harassment?
No,

1568
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,790
but it sucks and it's like it sucks 
dude.

1569
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:00,960
And that,
that,

1570
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:02,063
that is the,
is what a lot of fucking women had been 

1571
01:14:04,381 --> 01:14:09,381
dealing with for a long time and they're
pissed and they're rightfully rightfully

1572
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:11,710
fucking pissed.
It's like,

1573
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:15,310
who wants to be dominated like that?
If I'm getting dominated,

1574
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,770
I want to be paying for it.
You know what I mean?

1575
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:19,000
I don't want it.

1576
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,630
No,
no doubt man.

1577
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:26,623
Um,
I really do think there's something to 

1578
01:14:28,211 --> 01:14:33,211
this idea that humans aren't meant to be
in these small areas totally enclosed in

1579
01:14:34,451 --> 01:14:37,330
together with each other all day.
I don't think we're designed for it.

1580
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:38,203
No,
I just don't think that's an intimate 

1581
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:41,500
environment.
As weird as that sounds.

1582
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:42,663
And this is not saying that men and 
women can't work together and be 

1583
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:46,350
totally,
you know,

1584
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:48,520
platonic.
And they absolutely can.

1585
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:49,383
Yeah.
But it's,

1586
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:50,513
it's a super unnatural behavior,
unnatural environment to be in these 

1587
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,393
cubicles.
You small little boxed in offices 

1588
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,560
working day in,
day out with people,

1589
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:01,690
smelling them.
And you know,

1590
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:04,270
I think we should outlaw offices.
Yes.

1591
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:08,100
We have to get shit done.
Working at home,

1592
01:15:08,101 --> 01:15:08,934
a kiss for it

1593
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:15,650
solutions,
but definitely protected by the state.

1594
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:20,000
The state man who's going to fix the 
roads,

1595
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:24,190
we could fix the roads.
We'll figure it out.

1596
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,240
We'll figure it out.

1597
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,073
We were talking about something earlier 
that I wrote down because I wanted to 

1598
01:15:27,941 --> 01:15:28,774
remember it.
You were saying about Bob Dylan's 

1599
01:15:30,701 --> 01:15:34,300
version of all along the watchtower 
versus Jimi Hendrix.

1600
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,493
I think Jimi Hendrix was amazing,
but Bob Dylan's was his and he wrote it 

1601
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,820
and it was something cool about.
Listen to those words.

1602
01:15:42,821 --> 01:15:47,740
Even it wasn't like as pleasing orally,
but there's a.

1603
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:48,603
If you go to cat power official,
you know cat power is saying she has a 

1604
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:55,740
video up today that she put on her 
instagram.

1605
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:56,623
She's got a great instagram and a video 
up today of Bob Dylan in the 19 sixties 

1606
01:16:01,571 --> 01:16:02,404
in Paris,
getting all these really dumb questions 

1607
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:05,134
thrown at him and he's doing like this 
press conference and he's sitting there 

1608
01:16:08,201 --> 01:16:11,260
smoking cigarettes.
He looks like he's like 25 years old and

1609
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:14,110
they're yelling things at them and 
asking them questions like,

1610
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:17,490
what did you find it?
Yeah,

1611
01:16:17,491 --> 01:16:18,090
pull it.
What?

1612
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:19,000
Listen to this.
Listen.

1613
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:19,960
It's kind of crazy,
man.

1614
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,353
Do you agree that you should be the 
leader of singles with a message is 

1615
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:31,790
don't you attend your first breakfast 
one that's better than the ones that you

1616
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:36,791
do now?
You said that he's American American.

1617
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:43,293
Well,
that's why you probably did better is 

1618
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:55,630
because I feel like singing off on each 
particular special to express.

1619
01:16:57,921 --> 01:17:02,921
When you're saying no folks

1620
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:17,690
kind of weird,
Huh?

1621
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:20,420
Yeah,
I'll fucking weird French,

1622
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:24,380
but how weird is that?
Like seeing this is essentially like the

1623
01:17:24,381 --> 01:17:26,390
same dumb questions you'd get on 
twitter.

1624
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:27,273
Yeah.
Twitter accounts would get those exact 

1625
01:17:31,581 --> 01:17:35,000
same student.
Take your oldest dogs better than.

1626
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:36,063
You'll see that there's some performance
art is to hired a security for himself 

1627
01:17:44,931 --> 01:17:45,764
and a cameraman and he walked through 
times square pretending to be super 

1628
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:50,594
famous and they had other people like at
the periphery studying the crowd 

1629
01:17:55,251 --> 01:17:59,510
reaction to this staged famous person 
walking through Times Square.

1630
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:00,560
Here,
we're seeing this.

1631
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,730
No,
I forget.

1632
01:18:01,731 --> 01:18:02,564
I wouldn't.
I don't know how to tell Jamie to look 

1633
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:04,700
for it,
but it's incredible.

1634
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:06,850
They interview people,
right?

1635
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:07,693
Who have seen him in there.
These two huge black dudes and a guy 

1636
01:18:10,341 --> 01:18:12,470
with a camera and he's like walking 
around like he's,

1637
01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:13,343
you know,
fucking superstar and they interview 

1638
01:18:15,051 --> 01:18:19,340
people around is this Damn Jamie,
you are fast.

1639
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:24,350
So this is him by himself.
Normally I guess security with a suit on

1640
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:28,430
and security and I remember they asked 
people like,

1641
01:18:28,431 --> 01:18:31,440
what do you think of whatever name it is
a.

1642
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:32,443
and one of the dudes was like,
well I really liked his early stuff and 

1643
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,800
this was not one of the guys that was 
paid off.

1644
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,190
This is another person on the street.
It's just making it a random idiot.

1645
01:18:43,191 --> 01:18:44,750
Yeah.
That's so hilarious.

1646
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:46,240
Well,
I've had that happen to me before.

1647
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:47,780
Will someone come up and ask me for a 
picture?

1648
01:18:47,781 --> 01:18:49,370
And then another guy will pull out his 
phone and go,

1649
01:18:49,371 --> 01:18:51,090
who are you man?
I'm like,

1650
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:54,500
I'm nobody picture.
It's like getting a camera.

1651
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:56,930
I'm going to get a picture with you too 
if I know who you are.

1652
01:18:57,550 --> 01:18:59,340
You don't know who I am.
So why would you want a picture window?

1653
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:00,260
That's crazy.

1654
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,530
Just don't grab his waist when if you.
If you double pinch my fat,

1655
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:08,030
I will call it shit.
Double Pinch my family.

1656
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:12,170
You've done tens of thousands of photos 
after your shows.

1657
01:19:12,171 --> 01:19:14,590
You always stand out there and you take 
a photo of every morning.

1658
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:17,360
Oh really?
Weird man.

1659
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,680
Shows got too big.
Yeah,

1660
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:21,710
like the Belko theater.
I just didn't tell you.

1661
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,120
You're doing really big.
Yeah,

1662
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:23,983
it's too bad news.
I'll do it still at the ice house and 

1663
01:19:25,341 --> 01:19:27,050
stuff like that.
But sometimes people,

1664
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,960
they have an agenda and it's not just to
say hi,

1665
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:31,730
you know,
and they just want to monopolize.

1666
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:34,580
Not Monopolize your time.
They don't care if people around you and

1667
01:19:34,581 --> 01:19:36,080
you're run to those people and you don't
know what.

1668
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:38,120
It's just too much work.
Yeah,

1669
01:19:38,121 --> 01:19:39,340
it's crazy.
Did that,

1670
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:40,700
man.
That was crazy.

1671
01:19:40,701 --> 01:19:41,534
You did that.
That was,

1672
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:43,400
that's crazy.
I remember thinking,

1673
01:19:43,401 --> 01:19:44,234
man,
it's a lot of times shannon out there 

1674
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,370
did it for 3,700
people.

1675
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:52,880
Add like an extra couple of hours to.
You're there for two hours.

1676
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,710
Yeah.
A second show.

1677
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,293
Literally.
Did you have a fucking immune system on 

1678
01:20:00,961 --> 01:20:02,620
fire?
Because when you think of all those,

1679
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:06,830
like when you think like if like we 
could take your hand after shaking three

1680
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:08,030
people's hands.
So

1681
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:10,500
there's never that many people with is 
3,700

1682
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:11,640
people in the theater.
100.

1683
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:12,653
It might've been a thousand.
Take your hand and if we could put it 

1684
01:20:14,761 --> 01:20:17,090
under like a scanning microscope,
you know.

1685
01:20:17,091 --> 01:20:20,130
How much shit do you think is on your 
hand after one of those nights?

1686
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:24,210
Probably like a pretty lots of shit.
Lots of stuff.

1687
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,170
Lots of com.
Com pitfalls.

1688
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:31,640
What sweat shirt or sweater?
I just like it.

1689
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:35,700
It's got to be some period blood on my 
hands.

1690
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,140
Some fight.
And who knows man.

1691
01:20:37,141 --> 01:20:39,160
Maybe like pizza,
pizza,

1692
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:40,890
[inaudible].
A lot of weed.

1693
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:41,933
Some we'd never know.
People try to slip it into your pocket 

1694
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:47,880
or something handed to me.
They put it in my hand.

1695
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:50,910
I was telling I can't.
First of all I get too much weed.

1696
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,150
So anybody trying to get me,
we'd please don't give me any weed.

1697
01:20:53,151 --> 01:20:54,220
I get too much wheat.

1698
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,670
And then second of all I can't.
I don't know.

1699
01:20:56,671 --> 01:20:58,980
You can just take your weed.
Just can't.

1700
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,480
I can't,
I wish I could.

1701
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,370
I wish I could.
I'm sure you cool.

1702
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:03,480
You know.
Sure you are.

1703
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:05,070
But I have kids.
Somebody gave me.

1704
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:06,173
Somebody gave me Iowasca after a show.
I'll just drag it right there on the 

1705
01:21:08,881 --> 01:21:09,870
spot.
It was a,

1706
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:14,550
it was a tough.
It's a tough with black.

1707
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:17,280
Oh Geez.
It's IOWASCA.

1708
01:21:17,281 --> 01:21:18,114
I remember taking it back to my towel,
looking at it and for a second thinking 

1709
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:24,630
like what?
What would happen if I drink Iowasca and

1710
01:21:24,631 --> 01:21:28,820
a fucking holiday inn.
Like how bad would that trip be?

1711
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:29,683
Be fucking wonderful.
The ceiling would open up to be 

1712
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,030
propelled right through it.
Yeah.

1713
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,630
It's the same stuff that William hurt 
drank in altered states,

1714
01:21:36,631 --> 01:21:37,620
bro.
This is the real shit.

1715
01:21:37,621 --> 01:21:41,750
I got saved in a tupperware.
Just shake it first dude.

1716
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:42,593
Once,
once,

1717
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:47,430
once I got it,
I got home after the show I've flown and

1718
01:21:47,431 --> 01:21:51,510
someone had given me this framed picture
and I have this frame picture.

1719
01:21:51,511 --> 01:21:54,180
I don't remember what the art was.
It's like a skull or something.

1720
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:55,303
I wasn't somehow like I ended up pulling
the thing open and inside the picture 

1721
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:02,423
was a fucking joint.
The guy had shoved a joint into the 

1722
01:22:05,911 --> 01:22:09,620
picture and I had flown with it.
So if they had,

1723
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:13,440
if they had like seeing if they'd open 
that shit up,

1724
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:16,830
they would have seen a joint and I 
would've had to been like,

1725
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:17,664
Nah man,
somebody gave that to me to show it was 

1726
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:23,940
fucking hippie shit.
Dumb ass trying to smuggle one joint.

1727
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:28,380
So it's dangerous.
It's tricky,

1728
01:22:28,381 --> 01:22:29,970
man.
You can really get in trouble.

1729
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:32,210
Had An interesting experience recently 
at Heathrow.

1730
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:33,103
I don't know if.
Did you want to talk about this in New 

1731
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:34,620
York?

1732
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:37,150
Anyway,
I was flying through Heathrow and uh,

1733
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:40,560
I had a connecting flight,
miss the connecting flight,

1734
01:22:40,561 --> 01:22:42,420
but whatever.
There's another one two hours later.

1735
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:43,254
So I'm going through security because 
you have to like go again through 

1736
01:22:45,871 --> 01:22:48,150
security at Heathrow when you're coming 
from outside Europe.

1737
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:49,703
And uh,
I'm standing in their way and they take 

1738
01:22:51,871 --> 01:22:52,704
my bag for a secondary check and,
and I see the woman talked to the boss 

1739
01:22:56,581 --> 01:22:58,710
and he says,
we'll use the other one over there.

1740
01:22:58,711 --> 01:23:02,730
So she takes my bag over to this other,
a security line that's not functioning.

1741
01:23:02,731 --> 01:23:04,260
And she runs it through the machine 
there.

1742
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,020
She comes back and they talk for

1743
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,540
a minute and he comes over to me and he 
says,

1744
01:23:07,541 --> 01:23:10,720
you and I have to have a conversation.
I said,

1745
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:12,310
okay.
He said,

1746
01:23:12,311 --> 01:23:13,510
um,
what do you do?

1747
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,600
Like writer,
psychologist?

1748
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:17,321
And he's like,
yeah,

1749
01:23:17,321 --> 01:23:18,790
but what do you do?
What hobbies do you have?

1750
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,490
Hobbies?
And I literally,

1751
01:23:21,491 --> 01:23:22,061
I said,
dude,

1752
01:23:22,061 --> 01:23:23,830
I'm 55.
I jerk off and go to bed.

1753
01:23:23,831 --> 01:23:28,831
I don't have any hobbies.
He didn't smile and he's like,

1754
01:23:29,681 --> 01:23:30,920
you have a garden.
It was like,

1755
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,680
no,
that you work with animals.

1756
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:34,240
No.
Like,

1757
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:36,640
I don't know,
like fertilizer or something.

1758
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:39,130
Fertilizer residue got on your brain.
They use that for bombs.

1759
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:40,700
So he's a surgeon,
right?

1760
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:41,411
He's like,
well,

1761
01:23:41,411 --> 01:23:43,990
you haven't told me a story that makes 
sense,

1762
01:23:43,991 --> 01:23:46,270
so I have to call the police.
I was like,

1763
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:47,350
what are you talking to me?
He's like,

1764
01:23:47,351 --> 01:23:48,680
well,
night night,

1765
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:53,110
a nitrates set off the machines,
shut off the other machine.

1766
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:53,973
They're never wrong.
You're going to have to sit down right 

1767
01:23:55,571 --> 01:23:58,180
there and wait.
And he tells this other guy,

1768
01:23:58,181 --> 01:23:59,710
watch him.
Don't let him go anywhere.

1769
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:01,360
Like yeah,
I'm gonna make a run for it,

1770
01:24:01,361 --> 01:24:03,910
and he threw and these cops show up 
dude,

1771
01:24:03,911 --> 01:24:08,911
and they were like nine cops and body 
armor like surrounded me and you know,

1772
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:10,900
it was like,
wow,

1773
01:24:10,901 --> 01:24:15,901
this is what it feels like to go down.
But you are also a 55 year old white guy

1774
01:24:16,571 --> 01:24:20,230
who's obviously well educated.
You're not speaking with a weird accent.

1775
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:22,180
Exactly.
That's what I'm thinking.

1776
01:24:22,181 --> 01:24:24,880
So if it,
if I were black or you're whatever,

1777
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,250
for me,
I would've been terrified.

1778
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,540
Did you see the video that I posted to 
the guy that got gunned down?

1779
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,180
Watch it.
I did.

1780
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:33,790
So horrific.
Unbelievable.

1781
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:35,350
It's a murder.
It was murdered.

1782
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,020
And also why do you have to crawl across
the fucking floor?

1783
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:38,853
How does they put your hands over your 
head and we come over and cuff you 

1784
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,600
because they wanted to clear the room 
who's near the room.

1785
01:24:43,601 --> 01:24:45,160
They didn't want them to be too close to
the room.

1786
01:24:45,161 --> 01:24:45,994
The room was slightly around the corner,
but the way that guy escalated it was 

1787
01:24:49,331 --> 01:24:54,331
playing a game of Simon says with them 
and I will fucking shoot you.

1788
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:58,000
And then did shoot him for just reaching
back to grab his pants.

1789
01:24:58,001 --> 01:25:00,250
His pants were falling down.
It was as he was crawling,

1790
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:02,560
I mean was.
He was in no way,

1791
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:04,450
looked like he was doing something 
dangerous.

1792
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:05,523
But the most fucking disturbing thing 
was how many people in the comments 

1793
01:25:08,021 --> 01:25:10,750
after I posted that video on twitter,
we're saying,

1794
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:12,220
you know,
that he didn't comply.

1795
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,670
They were like saying clean kill.
He didn't comply and clean,

1796
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,010
clean,
clean,

1797
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:21,693
clean,
kill.

1798
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:23,680
Come on,
come on Joe.

1799
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,960
That's a clean kill.
And also one that the guy was drunk,

1800
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:27,280
he was young.
He's,

1801
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:28,383
you know,
it's an open carry state by the way was 

1802
01:25:29,741 --> 01:25:30,471
white.
Yeah,

1803
01:25:30,471 --> 01:25:31,680
he was white.
He had.

1804
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:34,780
This is not an agency if the guy that 
killed him.

1805
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:37,150
Monster.
Scary looking dude,

1806
01:25:37,151 --> 01:25:38,220
man.
Jamie can you.

1807
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:42,550
I'm fucked.
Written on his Ar.

1808
01:25:42,630 --> 01:25:45,890
He fucked your for your,
for your friend.

1809
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:50,290
And then I should say I'm fucked.
And then the other thing was they didn't

1810
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:51,124
let the jury look at the video.
They thought it would take them like it 

1811
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:57,160
would change their opinion.
Like what are you talking about?

1812
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,140
Reality.
To see that video,

1813
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:01,390
that video is,
there's the guy,

1814
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:02,263
what the fuck Jesus Christ man,
go a good beat up a lot in high school 

1815
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:13,220
and there's that old expression.
If you give someone a hammer,

1816
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:14,143
everything looks like a nail.
That's the only tool you have is a 

1817
01:26:16,521 --> 01:26:16,940
hammer.

1818
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:17,773
Everything looks like a nail and you're 
given this young guy who's obviously 

1819
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:23,510
fucking psycho mean the way he gun that 
guy down.

1820
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:28,220
I mean that was insane.
Just fucking insane.

1821
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,353
And the idea that this represents two 
human beings in an interaction and that 

1822
01:26:34,911 --> 01:26:35,744
one human being has that much power over
the other one that he can yell at them 

1823
01:26:38,421 --> 01:26:40,520
screaming,
I'm totally escalate the situation,

1824
01:26:40,521 --> 01:26:42,230
not deescalate,
you know,

1825
01:26:42,231 --> 01:26:44,450
and that he's got this gun out by the 
way,

1826
01:26:44,451 --> 01:26:45,284
which you're in an open carry state.
So if the guy did have a toy gun or 

1827
01:26:49,601 --> 01:26:50,434
whatever the fuck they said he had,
and he's holding this toy gun and 

1828
01:26:53,091 --> 01:26:56,120
someone calls the police,
you're allowed to have a toy gun,

1829
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:59,330
you're allowed to have a gun gun in 
Arizona.

1830
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:00,283
I read that he was state,
he was an exterminator and he had like 

1831
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:04,183
22 or something that he used for 
extermination in the room and somebody 

1832
01:27:07,011 --> 01:27:10,010
saw through the window him holding a 
rifle,

1833
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:13,900
but you know what man,
those are legal thing,

1834
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:17,420
unless someone just got completely 
hysterical and called and said,

1835
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:18,403
hey,
the guy's pointing the gun out the 

1836
01:27:19,041 --> 01:27:21,260
window at people and this is the message
that got in.

1837
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:24,740
The cops don't know when they show up,
but when you see that guy and that woman

1838
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:25,603
and you just see their fucking body 
language as they're walking down the 

1839
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:29,390
hallway,
super casual,

1840
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,610
they're not walking like people that are
about to kill people.

1841
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:33,740
They go,
they comply immediately.

1842
01:27:33,741 --> 01:27:36,470
The guys begging for his life,
please don't shoot me.

1843
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:40,100
The whole thing was horrific.
Yeah.

1844
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:41,263
Yeah,
and so I mean this gets back to we were 

1845
01:27:42,441 --> 01:27:43,274
talking about with the women this moment
in history where women are tired of the 

1846
01:27:45,621 --> 01:27:46,454
sleazy hand rubs.
I think we're also at the moment were 

1847
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:49,483
nonwhite.
People are fucking tired of being done 

1848
01:27:51,741 --> 01:27:52,790
down.
Everybody's.

1849
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:56,100
This is a white guy,
so you know what I'm saying?

1850
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:57,740
This is everybody so imagined.
Well,

1851
01:27:57,741 --> 01:27:58,880
but it doesn't show.
It's everyone.

1852
01:27:58,881 --> 01:28:00,890
It shows it.
It happens to white people sometimes.

1853
01:28:00,891 --> 01:28:02,570
But imagine the black guy.
I mean,

1854
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,110
you're right.

1855
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:05,030
I got in Albuquerque,
homeless dude,

1856
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:08,990
and they fucking throw grenades and he 
starts running.

1857
01:28:08,991 --> 01:28:09,591
Oh yeah,
there was,

1858
01:28:09,591 --> 01:28:11,820
this happened like two years ago.
There was a homeless guy.

1859
01:28:11,821 --> 01:28:15,710
He's sleeping right out in the bush 
somewhere near Albuquerque.

1860
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:18,140
And the cops come out,
they throw a flash.

1861
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:20,750
Flash grenade scares the fuck out of 
him.

1862
01:28:20,751 --> 01:28:22,190
He jumps up,
starts running away.

1863
01:28:22,191 --> 01:28:23,024
They got him down from the back.
They shoot them in the back as he's 

1864
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:26,570
running away.
And it's like.

1865
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:28,560
And they were acquitted.
I mean,

1866
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:30,290
it's,
it's nuts.

1867
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:33,950
That is.
There's no accountability.

1868
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,840
And uh,
so.

1869
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:38,840
But the thing that I,
you know,

1870
01:28:38,841 --> 01:28:39,674
the,
what's the line that a thing it was 

1871
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:44,870
Benjamin Franklin or,
or one of the founding fathers said that

1872
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,540
the police,
the revolution,

1873
01:28:48,730 --> 01:28:49,563
the revolution occasionally has to be a,
like a fed with the blood of their 

1874
01:28:57,890 --> 01:29:02,040
history of liberty must sometimes be 
watered with

1875
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,200
the blood of Patriots.

1876
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,560
Martyrs.
What?

1877
01:29:06,561 --> 01:29:08,130
A fucked up tree.
Hey man,

1878
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,360
why you got that in your garden,
man,

1879
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,460
that's fucking get that thing out of 
your.

1880
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,153
But don't you think there's like a 
cleansing revolution that has to happen 

1881
01:29:19,161 --> 01:29:20,120
every once in a while.

1882
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:22,620
I think what we're experiencing now as 
people,

1883
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:23,483
well,
what we're getting from information 

1884
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:25,374
right and where we're getting from this 
use of the Internet is the ability to 

1885
01:29:27,451 --> 01:29:28,284
spread information instantaneously.
This video could have existed decades 

1886
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:33,350
ago and we've never seen it,
you know,

1887
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:34,293
and there would be no need for potty 
cameras back then either they didn't 

1888
01:29:36,241 --> 01:29:37,740
have the technology.
So now they do.

1889
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:41,910
Everyone has to have a body camera.
This guy did this knowing he was filming

1890
01:29:41,911 --> 01:29:44,430
it,
which is even more insane.

1891
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:47,970
Like imagine this guy completely 
unfiltered,

1892
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:48,893
right?
I mean,

1893
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:52,910
he might've just gone that guy down for 
the fuck of it as soon as he saw him.

1894
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,153
I mean,
he might be just a guy looking to shoot 

1895
01:29:56,251 --> 01:29:57,810
people,
which is real.

1896
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:58,241
Well,
no,

1897
01:29:58,241 --> 01:29:59,980
this is the thing that we're,
this is like you're saying,

1898
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:00,350
oh,
what,

1899
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:01,270
you know,
priests,

1900
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:03,920
molesting kids.
Uh,

1901
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:05,560
and why?
Well,

1902
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:06,423
a lot.
I don't know why there are so many are 

1903
01:30:09,761 --> 01:30:13,250
doing it,
but one thing's for sure sociopath's and

1904
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:16,690
people who are trying to do fucked up 
shit.

1905
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:17,820
Wait,
what was the.

1906
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:19,810
You're saying about.
What's her name?

1907
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:20,943
Kira.
What was it you were saying that she 

1908
01:30:22,241 --> 01:30:23,980
liked DP.
Oh yeah.

1909
01:30:24,290 --> 01:30:25,020
What?
What does he do?

1910
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:25,853
So she said she.
She was joking on this podcast I did 

1911
01:30:28,091 --> 01:30:28,924
with her.
She was like,

1912
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,073
you know,
I think I've gained the system because 

1913
01:30:31,131 --> 01:30:35,380
what I love the most in sex is DP and 
that's what they pay the most for now.

1914
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:39,140
What he being doubled penetration for 
some people aren't fucked up.

1915
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,460
Both of them.
Brand new new listeners.

1916
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:47,340
What that shows.
That's a person who

1917
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:51,120
figured out truly you'd figured out how 
to make money doing what she loves.

1918
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:55,590
And so in the same way,
when you have these fucking sociopath,

1919
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:58,530
these pedophiles who want to make a 
career,

1920
01:30:59,000 --> 01:30:59,833
we want to figure out a way to do what 
they're doing while while like 

1921
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:03,700
sustaining themselves.
Well,

1922
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:04,621
they're like,
oh,

1923
01:31:04,621 --> 01:31:07,680
I'll just become a priest.
If I become a priest I'm going to have.

1924
01:31:07,681 --> 01:31:08,514
And it's all power.
All talking power dynamics here because 

1925
01:31:11,161 --> 01:31:16,161
it's like it's not enough the you're an 
older man and you're helpless kid,

1926
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:17,933
but on top of that you're a 
representative of the creative force of 

1927
01:31:21,271 --> 01:31:24,810
the universe.
You're like the fucking spokesperson for

1928
01:31:24,811 --> 01:31:25,644
the universe.
The power dynamic there is a is it's 

1929
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:31,500
almost as skewed as it can fucking get 
it in the same way that guy,

1930
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:33,870
that guy.
No,

1931
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:35,640
I mean,
you think when that guy goes home,

1932
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:36,803
he's like listening to sounds of 
waterfalls and shit and taking baths 

1933
01:31:39,481 --> 01:31:40,620
with lavender candles.

1934
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:41,753
That guy is.
That guy goes fucking home and he just 

1935
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:45,720
probably just fucking punches a brick 
wall.

1936
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,700
He just punches.
Was He?

1937
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:50,340
He's uh,
that guy is not a happy dude.

1938
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,233
I agree.
And he likes to dominate people and he 

1939
01:31:52,831 --> 01:31:55,380
wants to be in control and he wants to 
have power.

1940
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:00,560
And he got himself into a job where he 
could be a get paid to be the worst kind

1941
01:32:01,121 --> 01:32:01,954
of murderous bully there is.
And that's what's really happening is 

1942
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:05,374
that we have in our society monsters and
the monsters are smart and they're 

1943
01:32:10,631 --> 01:32:13,510
figuring out ways to get in positions of
power.

1944
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:16,000
And We,
before the bloody revolution,

1945
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:17,163
we just need to come up with better ways
to scan for these fucking assholes so 

1946
01:32:20,531 --> 01:32:24,820
that we can keep them out of these 
positions of power not scanned for them.

1947
01:32:24,821 --> 01:32:25,654
We encouraged them.
The system is built in such a way that 

1948
01:32:28,211 --> 01:32:29,044
they're encouraged.

1949
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:30,063
I mean,
it's no accident that we ended up with 

1950
01:32:31,571 --> 01:32:34,750
psychopaths as president.
Who the fuck else would want to do that?

1951
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:38,350
Who seeks a psychopath?
I don't either.

1952
01:32:38,351 --> 01:32:42,490
I think Obama and Jimmy Carter,
or to a real exceptions to that,

1953
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:43,300
we'll wait.
Well,

1954
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:44,133
we have to.
I don't think psychopath is the right 

1955
01:32:45,131 --> 01:32:46,230
word for it,
but we do do.

1956
01:32:46,231 --> 01:32:48,300
You do kind of have to come up with low 
maniac.

1957
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,560
Well you need to come up with a 
definition of terms,

1958
01:32:50,561 --> 01:32:52,450
right?
So it's like for example,

1959
01:32:52,451 --> 01:32:53,284
like Obama,
like you gonna have to come up with an 

1960
01:32:54,121 --> 01:32:58,300
inarguable.
Things like Obama for sure ordered drone

1961
01:32:58,301 --> 01:32:59,134
strikes that killed people.
So if you order a drone strike and it 

1962
01:33:01,481 --> 01:33:04,570
kills people,
are you a murderer or that's a question.

1963
01:33:04,571 --> 01:33:06,850
Are you a murderer?
If you order a drone strike and it kills

1964
01:33:06,851 --> 01:33:07,550
people.

1965
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:08,383
And the numbers are insane.
The number of innocence is in the high 

1966
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,800
eighties.
Does that make you a murderer?

1967
01:33:12,801 --> 01:33:14,650
Does that make you a murderer?
80,000

1968
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:16,440
now percent.
Oh percent.

1969
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:17,383
Like if you have a dentist before Jamie 
with the number of innocence killed by 

1970
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:23,683
drone strikes,
I think it's in somewhere in the 80 

1971
01:33:25,251 --> 01:33:26,600
range.
Eighty percent range

1972
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:29,320
that that would.
Would that make him a murderer?

1973
01:33:29,321 --> 01:33:32,470
Like is it safe to say when you're using
adjectives for him,

1974
01:33:32,471 --> 01:33:35,050
you could say,
well he has.

1975
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:37,140
Could you say he has murdered?

1976
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:38,780
Cool.
Could you say this?

1977
01:33:38,781 --> 01:33:39,614
That we have an infant tile view of what
the president is because there are so 

1978
01:33:42,921 --> 01:33:43,754
many tasks in so many human beings in so
many things that are connected to him 

1979
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:48,403
that the idea that he is the one giving 
all the orders for all these different 

1980
01:33:51,321 --> 01:33:54,200
things that are happening all over the 
world is kind of absurd.

1981
01:33:54,710 --> 01:33:57,440
It's like a monotheistic God or the 
Daddy.

1982
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,433
We we really need to go to a,
a more community based understanding of 

1983
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:03,433
religion and politics of everything.
There shouldn't be one person in charge 

1984
01:34:06,531 --> 01:34:07,670
of everything.
That's ridiculous.

1985
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:10,400
One guy just thinking about two massive 
issues,

1986
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:15,550
geopolitics and a and finance.
These are two things that the government

1987
01:34:17,511 --> 01:34:18,344
is supposed to have their hands on,
their source to be able to control the 

1988
01:34:22,191 --> 01:34:23,024
way we interact with world leaders,
all sorts of weird military 

1989
01:34:27,891 --> 01:34:31,730
dictatorships and the Middle East and in
North Korea.

1990
01:34:31,731 --> 01:34:34,190
We have to interact with all of these 
countries,

1991
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:36,860
hundreds of countries.
Then on top of that,

1992
01:34:37,010 --> 01:34:40,260
he's responsible for job growth.
Like what?

1993
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:41,890
Who is this fucking guy?
Right.

1994
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:43,700
What else is he doing?
He's ordering Jones trikes.

1995
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:46,130
He's ordering drone strikes to what else
is doing?

1996
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:48,680
He's keeping pot illegal.
That son of a bitch,

1997
01:34:48,681 --> 01:34:51,830
he's appointing Supreme Court judges 
just drilling in Alaska.

1998
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:55,490
He's cutting a new road through the 
Salmon River like he they're doing.

1999
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:58,010
He's one guy,
one guy

2000
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:02,390
doing any one guy with a full time job.
Doing any one of those.

2001
01:35:02,391 --> 01:35:03,224
Being responsible for the decisions is 
crazy for any one of those things are 

2002
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:07,393
the public face of the world.
Do you notice a trump and I used to 

2003
01:35:11,391 --> 01:35:13,550
think that people were exaggerating,
but he's losing his shit.

2004
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:16,180
He's micro strokes.
I think he's.

2005
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:17,083
He's slurring his words now a lot and he
drinks 12 cans of diet coke a day 

2006
01:35:21,231 --> 01:35:23,180
apparently,
which made me maybe fake news.

2007
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,800
They might be fucking with this,
I don't know,

2008
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:27,980
but he watches eight hours of television
a day.

2009
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,380
So perfect.
Representative of America.

2010
01:35:30,410 --> 01:35:31,243
Look at this.
Nearly 90 percent of the people killed 

2011
01:35:33,381 --> 01:35:36,770
in air strikes were not the intended 
targets during one,

2012
01:35:36,771 --> 01:35:41,771
five month period of operation between 
January 2012 and February 2013.

2013
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:45,000
Okay,
well why do they hate us?

2014
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:46,140
But why do they hate?
Well,

2015
01:35:46,141 --> 01:35:48,450
let's talk about the psychopath.
I do eat them.

2016
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:52,710
Let's talk about the psychopath idea.
Like what is a psychopath?

2017
01:35:52,711 --> 01:35:56,610
I mean this is a very special kind of,
of of murder that's happening here.

2018
01:35:56,611 --> 01:35:57,660
It's like,
you know,

2019
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:59,910
okay,
let's take the classic example.

2020
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:00,960
God,
Rhett,

2021
01:36:01,110 --> 01:36:03,570
may he rest in peace.
Charles Manson,

2022
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:06,630
one of the things he always said is,
I never killed anybody.

2023
01:36:06,631 --> 01:36:08,280
Man.
I never killed anybody.

2024
01:36:08,281 --> 01:36:09,900
And it's true.
I don't think he ever killed anybody.

2025
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:13,110
Tex Watson did all the killings.
So in with Manson,

2026
01:36:13,111 --> 01:36:15,180
it's like Jesus fucking Christ.
That guy is truly.

2027
01:36:15,181 --> 01:36:17,100
I mean,
he really is one of the classics.

2028
01:36:17,101 --> 01:36:19,380
He's amazing.
He's like one of the most entertaining,

2029
01:36:19,381 --> 01:36:22,770
entertaining psychopaths in America.
Maybe ever.

2030
01:36:22,771 --> 01:36:25,380
He's really great actor.
He's a great musician,

2031
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:27,180
but he's.
But the thing is like,

2032
01:36:27,181 --> 01:36:28,410
okay,
we know Manson.

2033
01:36:28,410 --> 01:36:31,490
That guy was out of his fucking Gore.
We age your garbage man.

2034
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:32,371
Yeah,
yeah.

2035
01:36:32,371 --> 01:36:35,110
You call it garbage dump.
I call it a gold mine,

2036
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:38,010
but like you take somebody like that and
it's like,

2037
01:36:38,011 --> 01:36:39,210
okay,
clearly nuts.

2038
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:44,280
But then you take someone like Obama or 
any American president who was killed so

2039
01:36:44,281 --> 01:36:45,114
many more people are ordered people to 
kill so many more people in many of 

2040
01:36:47,491 --> 01:36:48,324
those people or children and they're 
dressed in a suit and there are dapper 

2041
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:54,390
and they're fucking charismatic.
I mean,

2042
01:36:54,391 --> 01:36:56,490
fuck.
If Obama walked into the room right now,

2043
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:57,810
I do like,
wow,

2044
01:36:57,811 --> 01:36:58,591
Bama.
Wow,

2045
01:36:58,591 --> 01:36:59,424
great to meet you.

2046
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:04,230
You know how you know how a drone 
strikes get approved now,

2047
01:37:04,231 --> 01:37:08,610
lawyers,
what from the Defense Department?

2048
01:37:08,670 --> 01:37:11,070
Lawyers,
lawyers ultimately make the call whether

2049
01:37:11,071 --> 01:37:13,420
or not drone strikes get approved,
but dude,

2050
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,140
they get together with lawyers.
That's the.

2051
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,153
That's the day they have a target.
Say of the targets and apartment 

2052
01:37:19,411 --> 01:37:22,140
building,
they have a Geo locator on the target,

2053
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:23,013
like whatever it is,
whether it's a metadata from someone's 

2054
01:37:25,171 --> 01:37:28,800
cell phone that indicates the cell 
phones in this particular area,

2055
01:37:28,830 --> 01:37:31,860
how big of a target is this?
How much of a risk is it?

2056
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,790
What's the benefits of.
And they'll,

2057
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,310
they'll literally get together with 
lawyers.

2058
01:37:35,311 --> 01:37:38,220
This is according to a guy that I know 
that used to be one of the big wigs,

2059
01:37:38,221 --> 01:37:39,870
the CIA.
He's like,

2060
01:37:39,871 --> 01:37:41,820
this is what happens.
Mike Baker told me that.

2061
01:37:41,850 --> 01:37:42,683
Are they worried about getting sued or 
what they're worried about the legality 

2062
01:37:45,511 --> 01:37:47,310
of it,
how it's going to be perceived,

2063
01:37:47,311 --> 01:37:50,070
whether or not you can be tried as a war
criminal for this.

2064
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:51,270
Ah,
yeah.

2065
01:37:51,271 --> 01:37:56,271
Like it's not just the scary thing is 
not just that 90 are unintended targets.

2066
01:37:56,851 --> 01:37:57,684
It's that they know going in that 
they're going to kill a bunch of 

2067
01:38:00,991 --> 01:38:01,824
unintended gun him down.
Like you saw that collateral murder 

2068
01:38:05,521 --> 01:38:07,800
video,
which is what put what wiki leaks on the

2069
01:38:07,801 --> 01:38:12,801
map when they released that video that 
showed those guys gunning down and uh,

2070
01:38:13,981 --> 01:38:14,814
there was a minivan and these kids in 
the van and let the guys literal 

2071
01:38:17,761 --> 01:38:19,470
reaction is,
I shouldn't have brought the kids,

2072
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:22,380
shouldn't have brought the kids.
We had a gun.

2073
01:38:22,381 --> 01:38:23,310
You down.
Oh,

2074
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:24,840
whoops.
Turns out that wasn't a gun.

2075
01:38:24,841 --> 01:38:26,670
It was a camera.
My bad.

2076
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:30,030
I mean they're gunning you down with 
blurry images from the sky.

2077
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:31,163
And then when,
when they killed kids or thought they'd 

2078
01:38:33,571 --> 01:38:35,280
killed kids,
I think the kid survived.

2079
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:37,190
They were like,
shouldn't have brought the kid.

2080
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:38,341
Yeah.
And that.

2081
01:38:38,341 --> 01:38:40,940
And that's what's really wild about it,
is that freedom.

2082
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:43,620
We don't yet freedom the tree of fucking
liberty.

2083
01:38:43,621 --> 01:38:45,670
We got to water.
What do you want the thing to weather.

2084
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,870
But this is the,
this is that,

2085
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,700
that to me,
this is the most interesting thing about

2086
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:51,833
living in the United States is the way 
that you generally don't think about 

2087
01:38:57,031 --> 01:38:59,670
that stuff.
Like you just don't think about it.

2088
01:38:59,671 --> 01:39:01,770
It's not a thing that you really.
What are you going to do?

2089
01:39:01,771 --> 01:39:03,270
It's like,
you know,

2090
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:05,010
it's happening,
you know,

2091
01:39:05,011 --> 01:39:06,270
we've been doing it,
you know,

2092
01:39:06,271 --> 01:39:09,090
we've done it over and over and over and
over and over again,

2093
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:11,820
but really nobody.
What can we do?

2094
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:13,370
You vote your low,
low,

2095
01:39:13,410 --> 01:39:17,330
be politically active and maybe you can 
get somebody in power who isn't going to

2096
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:20,880
kill a bunch of people,
but inevitably they keep killing a bunch

2097
01:39:20,881 --> 01:39:21,714
of people.
They keep doing it and we keep ignoring 

2098
01:39:24,211 --> 01:39:29,160
it and that is one of the creepiest 
fucking things because it's the,

2099
01:39:29,161 --> 01:39:29,940
it's like,
alright,

2100
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:34,800
when here in the United States when a 
cop guns down somebody,

2101
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:37,530
thank God,
most people freak out.

2102
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:41,450
Like that video that you tweeted.
We all look at the video.

2103
01:39:41,470 --> 01:39:42,390
We're like,
my God,

2104
01:39:42,391 --> 01:39:44,970
how did that guy get off the hook?
We used to look at his picture.

2105
01:39:44,971 --> 01:39:48,510
He's a monster,
but w probably today,

2106
01:39:48,511 --> 01:39:50,610
I don't know for sure,
but this week,

2107
01:39:50,611 --> 01:39:54,720
certainly this month some people got 
exploded by the United States.

2108
01:39:54,721 --> 01:39:55,554
Right.

2109
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:56,593
Does that happen?
I mean this thing about drones is they 

2110
01:39:58,761 --> 01:39:59,594
don't really.
They don't tell you we're launching 

2111
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:02,440
drones

2112
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:03,273
strikes and then like let's talk about 
Yemen where all the weapons that Saudi 

2113
01:40:08,170 --> 01:40:09,003
Arabia is using to starve and destroy 
the Yemeni population came from the 

2114
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,440
United States,
so.

2115
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:19,300
And the pilots are trained by us and so 
we've got our drones blowing people up,

2116
01:40:19,301 --> 01:40:20,134
but also we've totally armed this 
country that's destroying this other 

2117
01:40:22,781 --> 01:40:24,940
country.
And do you know,

2118
01:40:24,941 --> 01:40:27,910
they know that it says USA on the bomb 
fragments.

2119
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:30,190
That's so fucked up.
Yeah.

2120
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:31,980
Yeah.
I don't know.

2121
01:40:32,510 --> 01:40:33,580
Sorry to.
I don't,

2122
01:40:33,650 --> 01:40:35,350
I don't know if this will derail it,
but you know,

2123
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:39,280
we're talking about Sam Harris earlier 
and the Bfi have a.

2124
01:40:39,290 --> 01:40:40,123
it's not a beef,
but the disagreement that I have with 

2125
01:40:41,781 --> 01:40:46,781
him around his Islam thing is that he 
totally discounts the role of US foreign

2126
01:40:47,871 --> 01:40:52,871
policy in creating the toxic environment
that gives rise to things like isis.

2127
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:58,030
So to ensure that he totally discount.
So because I don't think that's true.

2128
01:40:58,210 --> 01:40:59,290
Honestly,
I don't,

2129
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,393
you know a lot more about Sam than I do,
but some of my friends and listeners 

2130
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:04,811
will be like,
dude,

2131
01:41:04,811 --> 01:41:07,780
you got to listen to convenient talking 
point.

2132
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:08,853
I don't think he does.
I listen to one podcast he did where he 

2133
01:41:11,651 --> 01:41:16,651
was responding to this article in the,
the,

2134
01:41:17,090 --> 01:41:21,220
the publication of,
of Islamic Jihad or something,

2135
01:41:21,221 --> 01:41:22,054
and he was like,
look,

2136
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:23,740
this is what I'm talking about.

2137
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:25,080
Like all,
you know,

2138
01:41:25,081 --> 01:41:28,750
I'm a non Muslim,
should be killed and blah,

2139
01:41:28,751 --> 01:41:29,584
blah blah.
And he's going through this whole thing 

2140
01:41:30,501 --> 01:41:32,680
and it's been a year since I listened to
it.

2141
01:41:32,681 --> 01:41:33,514
So you know,
apologies to Sam if I'm misremembering 

2142
01:41:36,161 --> 01:41:38,170
this,
but what I remember thinking at the time

2143
01:41:38,171 --> 01:41:40,780
was he,
he said something like,

2144
01:41:40,781 --> 01:41:41,614
well,
there are people who think that it's US 

2145
01:41:42,401 --> 01:41:43,810
foreign policy,
but that's ridiculous.

2146
01:41:43,811 --> 01:41:45,400
This is Islam.
This is Islam.

2147
01:41:45,401 --> 01:41:48,850
It says it right here.
This is the ideology of Islam.

2148
01:41:48,851 --> 01:41:49,391
And I'm like,
yeah,

2149
01:41:49,391 --> 01:41:50,224
but dude,
that particular ideology of Islam is 

2150
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:57,790
taking hold a because of 100 years of 
foreign policy of,

2151
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:00,670
of humiliating and destroying these 
cultures,

2152
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:01,713
and B,
because of American support for the 

2153
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:05,883
Saudi supported a schools.
I forgot the name of the schools that 

2154
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:13,840
are all over the Middle East now because
of Saudi Arabia,

2155
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:16,510
putting them into Pakistan and 
Afghanistan and all that.

2156
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:19,210
That will hobby ism.
Exactly.

2157
01:42:19,211 --> 01:42:20,800
Thank you.
Yeah,

2158
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:21,634
so I mean I think this is really 
important that when you destroy 

2159
01:42:25,690 --> 01:42:27,970
countries and when you do it the way 
we're doing it,

2160
01:42:27,971 --> 01:42:30,370
we don't even have the balls to go in on
the ground.

2161
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:33,340
You're just blasting people from the 
clouds.

2162
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:34,593
It creates blowback and if that's 
expressed in terms of a religious 

2163
01:42:38,531 --> 01:42:41,890
ideology or whatever it is,
it's going to come back do.

2164
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:42,793
You're absolutely right.
But there's also stuff that's happening 

2165
01:42:45,251 --> 01:42:47,380
to places that it has nothing to do with
America.

2166
01:42:47,381 --> 01:42:48,214
That's also related to.
I mean look at what's going on in Iraq 

2167
01:42:51,851 --> 01:42:52,684
when the power vacuum was created 
because Saddam Hussein was killed and 

2168
01:42:56,351 --> 01:42:59,180
the Sunni's and this year I started a 
civil war and they're,

2169
01:42:59,181 --> 01:42:59,551
they're,
they're,

2170
01:42:59,551 --> 01:43:02,550
they're starting a war that has nothing 
to do with America again,

2171
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:06,190
and the fact that America took out their
dictator,

2172
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:07,780
but why does it exist?

2173
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:12,610
Who created Iraq?
We did the British and we created it and

2174
01:43:12,611 --> 01:43:14,620
we created it like we did.
When I say we,

2175
01:43:14,621 --> 01:43:17,650
I'm talking about European know post 
World War II team,

2176
01:43:17,651 --> 01:43:19,660
US principal,
World War One.

2177
01:43:19,661 --> 01:43:20,261
Really?
Yeah.

2178
01:43:20,261 --> 01:43:21,094
Team us.
When they created these countries in 

2179
01:43:23,051 --> 01:43:23,884
Africa as well,
they intentionally created them so that 

2180
01:43:26,171 --> 01:43:27,004
there were opposing tribes or 
populations within the country so that 

2181
01:43:30,311 --> 01:43:32,230
they could better exercise control over 
them.

2182
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:35,740
Right?
So they engineered the Sunni and Shiite.

2183
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:38,260
They engineered.
You look at the origins of,

2184
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:39,550
and I'm not an expert,
this is.

2185
01:43:39,551 --> 01:43:40,384
I've read this several different places,
but I know it happened in in Africa as 

2186
01:43:43,721 --> 01:43:44,554
well,
where they would intentionally draw the 

2187
01:43:45,461 --> 01:43:49,720
borders so that you have different 
tribes within that border who are all.

2188
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:50,613
You have a long lasting and enmity with 
each other so you can like arm and can 

2189
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,000
manipulate one tribe to dominate the 
others.

2190
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:01,950
And then when dee colonialization 
happen,

2191
01:44:01,951 --> 01:44:02,784
then we and we have all these unstable 
structures in place that we've left 

2192
01:44:07,251 --> 01:44:08,780
behind.
I think what you're asking

2193
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:09,653
lighting is that it's a very complex 
issue and it's not simply just the 

2194
01:44:13,051 --> 01:44:13,884
ideology and I 100 percent agree.
I don't think anybody who's reasonable 

2195
01:44:16,890 --> 01:44:17,723
couldn't agree,
but I also think that there's a problem 

2196
01:44:19,531 --> 01:44:20,364
with human psychology and ideologies and
and we have this very bizarre desire to 

2197
01:44:26,041 --> 01:44:26,874
be all in,
in whatever team that were on and when 

2198
01:44:29,851 --> 01:44:34,851
you're on a team that has in arguably in
2017,

2199
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:39,210
the most archaic mainstream ideology 
that's,

2200
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,470
that's Islam,
right?

2201
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:45,500
I mean if you stop and think about how 
ancient is it in its practices the way,

2202
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:48,960
especially when it's in use in radical 
ways,

2203
01:44:48,961 --> 01:44:52,050
the way women are forced to dress the 
way in Saudi Arabia,

2204
01:44:52,051 --> 01:44:54,420
I think up until really recently they 
weren't allowed to drive.

2205
01:44:54,421 --> 01:44:57,000
Right now they're allowing them to 
within the last two or three years,

2206
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:58,313
there's a lot of like stuff in it that 
we would think of as being a part of a 

2207
01:45:01,921 --> 01:45:05,160
bygone era of human beings.
So for Alabama,

2208
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:08,190
Roy Moore's losing though apparently is 
he?

2209
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:09,083
Yeah.
That's happening right down by 10 

2210
01:45:10,051 --> 01:45:10,884
points.

2211
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:16,140
Is paralyzed right on that.
Yeah.

2212
01:45:16,141 --> 01:45:18,020
There's definitely parallels.
There's,

2213
01:45:18,030 --> 01:45:18,863
I think it's like all things.
We're always looking for one reason why 

2214
01:45:21,871 --> 01:45:22,704
something exists and look,
the reason why you have this idea of 

2215
01:45:27,301 --> 01:45:32,301
jihad and jihadism being like involving 
suicide bombers and sacrifice and wore a

2216
01:45:34,891 --> 01:45:35,724
lot of that is direct directly 
attributable to what happened to 

2217
01:45:39,301 --> 01:45:40,134
Afghanistan during the Soviet Union's 
interaction with them when we were 

2218
01:45:43,051 --> 01:45:45,690
training the Muja hi dean.
If you don't,

2219
01:45:46,050 --> 01:45:46,883
the way they talked people into going to
war and arm them against the Soviet 

2220
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:52,980
Union.
These few tile attempts.

2221
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:55,560
Yeah.
There was a lot of like this.

2222
01:45:55,561 --> 01:45:58,920
A lot of encouragement for a lot of 
these suicidal tactics.

2223
01:45:59,080 --> 01:45:59,913
Maybe not necessarily suicide bombing,
but the mujahideen were armed directly 

2224
01:46:04,801 --> 01:46:09,801
by the United States and that is what 
turned Osama bin Ladin against us.

2225
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,340
Like he was with us.

2226
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:13,740
Charlie Wilson's war.
You seen that movie?

2227
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:14,910
No,
it's about that.

2228
01:46:14,911 --> 01:46:15,744
It's about the senator.
I think he was who went to Pakistan and 

2229
01:46:18,151 --> 01:46:21,450
oversaw the arming of the Mujahideen.
Tom Hanks.

2230
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:22,410
Oh,
right.

2231
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:27,410
I'm the guy.
Everyone says I look like a while ago.

2232
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:30,290
Philip Seymour Hoffman.
What is his name,

2233
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:31,283
feel?
Seymour Hoffman and also to relate back 

2234
01:46:34,201 --> 01:46:35,034
to what we were talking about earlier,
think about the role of sexual 

2235
01:46:36,661 --> 01:46:41,260
frustration in getting a martyr's.
You know,

2236
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:42,990
these are guys who never get laid.

2237
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:44,320
A lot of them.
These kids,

2238
01:46:44,321 --> 01:46:45,154
man,
a buddy of mine who was over in 

2239
01:46:46,301 --> 01:46:49,030
Afghanistan was telling me how they 
would put kids in front of

2240
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,490
because tractors weren't expensive.
Ah,

2241
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:54,070
Jesus,
Dr.

2242
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:54,790
Shawn,
right?

2243
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:56,760
Does doesn't want that.
Dr Baker wasn't.

2244
01:46:56,820 --> 01:46:58,770
I was thinking that was.
I'm andy.

2245
01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:00,260
I'm stumped,
but no,

2246
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:01,103
I think it was Sean Baker was telling me
that he was over in Afghanistan as a 

2247
01:47:03,931 --> 01:47:06,180
medic and he was saying that these guys 
had.

2248
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:07,740
He's like,
I can always make another son.

2249
01:47:07,741 --> 01:47:10,080
I can't get another tractor.
Jesus God.

2250
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:13,530
So the other kids walk in front of the 
tractors to look for landmines.

2251
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:15,900
D,
what does,

2252
01:47:15,901 --> 01:47:18,540
here's the super bowl.
The donkeys have blown up or any.

2253
01:47:18,541 --> 01:47:19,374
Just fucking imagine that.
That could even be something that 

2254
01:47:21,391 --> 01:47:22,224
someone could say and you realized the 
difference in the world that you'll in 

2255
01:47:25,081 --> 01:47:29,260
the harshness of the world that you're 
talking about and the worst thing.

2256
01:47:29,470 --> 01:47:32,540
Sorry.
The worst thing about Afghanistan is,

2257
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:33,623
I mean I know a lot old hippy,
so used to that was on the hippie trail 

2258
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:40,380
and Afghanistan was the best place.
Everybody loved Afghanistan.

2259
01:47:40,381 --> 01:47:43,590
The people are so nice.
So welcoming your,

2260
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:45,720
your bus breaks down in the middle of 
the nowhere.

2261
01:47:45,721 --> 01:47:46,554
People will come from miles away from 
the village and take you back to the 

2262
01:47:49,771 --> 01:47:50,604
village and feed you and take care of 
you and like it was the most hospitable 

2263
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:54,833
places.

2264
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:56,980
I'll tell you a scary story about that 
though,

2265
01:47:56,981 --> 01:47:57,814
because when I'm there is that one of 
the teachers that he's Rom dass 

2266
01:48:00,371 --> 01:48:02,200
retreats,
they all were on the hippie trail man.

2267
01:48:02,201 --> 01:48:03,610
And one of them,
her name's,

2268
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:06,560
I think Mirabai Bush,
I think Mira,

2269
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:07,310
Mira,
right?

2270
01:48:07,310 --> 01:48:09,250
Uh,
but she was telling the story how,

2271
01:48:09,430 --> 01:48:10,510
you know,
the hippie trail,

2272
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:11,553
they get in a bus.
They traveled through Europe to end up 

2273
01:48:13,781 --> 01:48:14,614
in India.
The fucking brotherhood of eternal love 

2274
01:48:17,051 --> 01:48:20,980
was like just just dispensing,
just acid.

2275
01:48:21,010 --> 01:48:22,530
Every listing.
Do this trip.

2276
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:24,080
No,
I mean you can have.

2277
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:27,610
You tried fucking bringing a rainbow bus
through Afghanistan now man.

2278
01:48:28,730 --> 01:48:31,510
We gotta go through Iran to get the 
soldiers to shoot it,

2279
01:48:32,050 --> 01:48:32,883
but she was telling the story about how 
like all these hippies were hanging out 

2280
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:36,850
at.
I don't know where they were at,

2281
01:48:36,851 --> 01:48:41,440
but these two fucking dudes wrote up and
horses wearing like,

2282
01:48:41,441 --> 01:48:42,400
you know,
the,

2283
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:43,720
the full garb.

2284
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:48,070
They had swords in one of the hippies 
said to them something like,

2285
01:48:48,071 --> 01:48:51,670
we're all children of God,
and he responded,

2286
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:53,763
my God has no children.
It was like some kind of heavy duty is 

2287
01:48:57,821 --> 01:48:58,541
law.
I'm just like,

2288
01:48:58,541 --> 01:49:00,760
fuck you hippie.
What are you talking about?

2289
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:02,020
So it wasn't.
It wasn't.

2290
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:03,053
It wasn't necessarily.
Everything wasn't necessarily peaceful 

2291
01:49:05,381 --> 01:49:08,620
and joyful over there with still 
fundamentalism happening there.

2292
01:49:08,621 --> 01:49:10,660
But I think all this shit we're talking 
about,

2293
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:15,100
they're really creepy thing is that 
whatever this is,

2294
01:49:15,130 --> 01:49:15,963
whether it's the United States stuck a 
fucking stick in the ants nest too much 

2295
01:49:19,810 --> 01:49:20,643
and now we've got like these 
fundamentalists lunatics who will blow 

2296
01:49:24,401 --> 01:49:27,410
themselves up to kill other people.
Now,

2297
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:28,453
whether we've got a viral form of a 
religion that is infected people's 

2298
01:49:33,101 --> 01:49:38,101
brains and is now like a contained is 
going to spread with adversity.

2299
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:39,573
Their real problem is we're also dealing
with an exponential increase in 

2300
01:49:42,970 --> 01:49:43,803
technological progress and this is when 
I interviewed this Guy Aaron Frank from 

2301
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:48,393
university and is a scary thing he said 
is eventually there's going to be 

2302
01:49:51,161 --> 01:49:51,994
technology that exists where you can 
just like you can engineer a engineer 

2303
01:49:57,431 --> 01:50:01,310
fucking ebola using some kind of 
biological three d printer when,

2304
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:03,460
when that,
that might be 50 years from now,

2305
01:50:03,461 --> 01:50:04,750
60 years from now,
I don't know,

2306
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,490
but it's not that far away.

2307
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:11,820
And also this fucking Cuban sound beam 
right there.

2308
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:12,773
There's kind of,
you know,

2309
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:15,880
the story popped up about these people 
in Cuba state.

2310
01:50:15,881 --> 01:50:19,210
There's some weird chirping sound.
The embassy at the embassy,

2311
01:50:19,211 --> 01:50:20,044
US embassy there shooting some sort of 
sound weapon at them and driving them 

2312
01:50:23,771 --> 01:50:24,604
crazy and it caused brain damage and so 
when you consider that already there is 

2313
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:29,493
apparently some new sonic weapon 
existing that can make you mentally 

2314
01:50:33,281 --> 01:50:34,114
disabled maybe permanently.
And we're dealing with people who are 

2315
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:40,660
mentally disabled.
And another fucking way,

2316
01:50:40,661 --> 01:50:45,661
which is that they become infected with 
some paradigm that makes them think that

2317
01:50:46,511 --> 01:50:51,490
there is an actual,
like loony God out there that wants them

2318
01:50:51,491 --> 01:50:56,491
to put babies in front of tractors and 
that wants them to explode other people.

2319
01:50:56,680 --> 01:50:57,513
And they could maybe get ahold of this 
sound beam that goes through walls and 

2320
01:51:02,051 --> 01:51:04,720
just start launching it into people's 
house through walls.

2321
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:06,100
I think it went through a wall.
Yeah.

2322
01:51:06,110 --> 01:51:08,890
So they haven't defined what this weapon
is specifically,

2323
01:51:08,891 --> 01:51:10,030
right?
This isn't a new thing.

2324
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:10,930
Well this is the.
No,

2325
01:51:10,931 --> 01:51:13,510
have some sound weapons,
some salad.

2326
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:16,060
But this is the thing.
There was a time when a nuclear bomb did

2327
01:51:16,061 --> 01:51:19,780
not exist and then it existed.
There was a time when a gun didn't exist

2328
01:51:19,781 --> 01:51:20,614
and then it existed.
So I think it'd be a safe bet to say in 

2329
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:26,530
the next 50 years we're going to get 
some brand new fucking weapon.

2330
01:51:26,710 --> 01:51:29,950
There's some guy in Darpa right now 
whipping up some fucking thing.

2331
01:51:29,951 --> 01:51:31,900
I don't know what it is.
So who knows what it is,

2332
01:51:31,901 --> 01:51:32,980
you know,
just like,

2333
01:51:32,981 --> 01:51:33,814
uh,
a new kind of flashlight that shines 

2334
01:51:35,591 --> 01:51:38,770
through walls.
And just makes you forget who you are,

2335
01:51:38,950 --> 01:51:42,010
why you saw what Elon Musk said about 
the robots.

2336
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:43,083
You need a strobe light to see him 
because there'll be moving so fast in 

2337
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:46,160
two years.

2338
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:47,530
Yeah.
Sleep tight,

2339
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:49,780
sleep tight.
Because it's like,

2340
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:50,703
you know,
not only do we have like these weapons 

2341
01:51:52,871 --> 01:51:54,850
are in the hands right now.
Like you said,

2342
01:51:55,190 --> 01:51:58,960
the nuclear weapons are in the hands of 
somebody won a popularity contest.

2343
01:51:59,410 --> 01:52:01,510
I don't know who's gonna control the 
fucking robots,

2344
01:52:01,511 --> 01:52:03,040
but one thing's for sure,
man,

2345
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:04,173
there's a lot of crazy people on the 
planet right now and they're going to 

2346
01:52:07,391 --> 01:52:10,650
have access to shit unlike anything 
we've ever,

2347
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:13,270
we've ever seen in the question.
Yes.

2348
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:15,760
And how about a weapon that just makes 
everyone.

2349
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:19,780
Infant tile doesn't kill you.
Like the idea of the hydrogen bomb,

2350
01:52:21,330 --> 01:52:22,730
the hydrogen bomb,
right?

2351
01:52:22,950 --> 01:52:25,150
That kills all the people.
Leaves.

2352
01:52:25,151 --> 01:52:27,880
All the buildings are beautiful.
But what about neutron bomb?

2353
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:29,650
Neutrons that what it is.
You're right.

2354
01:52:30,430 --> 01:52:32,450
What about stupid bomb?
Yeah,

2355
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:34,960
like a bomb that makes everybody have a 
50 Iq.

2356
01:52:34,990 --> 01:52:37,540
There you go.
They thought they would drop a LSD,

2357
01:52:37,541 --> 01:52:38,374
right?
They were experimenting with Lsd in the 

2358
01:52:40,151 --> 01:52:44,140
sixties and seventies thinking that they
could use that to make soldiers crazy on

2359
01:52:44,141 --> 01:52:46,040
the battlefield,
and so he initially wanted to use

2360
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:46,873
it as a truth serum.
They want to use it on captured enemy 

2361
01:52:48,651 --> 01:52:49,690
soldiers.
Yeah.

2362
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:50,430
Yeah.
There's.

2363
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:54,370
There's some hilarious videos from the 
19 fifties given soldiers acid,

2364
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:57,280
world war two video.
Yeah.

2365
01:52:57,370 --> 01:53:00,650
We'll post World War II.
They got them all doped up on acid,

2366
01:53:00,651 --> 01:53:01,484
I think their English troops from the UK
and they're wandering around and black 

2367
01:53:04,821 --> 01:53:06,470
and white footage.
Just tripping balls.

2368
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:07,713
That's right.

2369
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:09,193
Yeah.
It's true.

2370
01:53:09,250 --> 01:53:10,690
Dude.
This is the.

2371
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:15,590
This is actually why we need lsd right 
now because the problem is we're.

2372
01:53:15,591 --> 01:53:16,424
We're facing one of the most beautiful 
things that could ever happen to our 

2373
01:53:19,191 --> 01:53:20,024
society,
which is we're about to create this 

2374
01:53:22,941 --> 01:53:23,774
beautiful technology that is going to be
something unlike anything we've ever 

2375
01:53:28,311 --> 01:53:30,320
seen and it's wonderful.
It's wonderful.

2376
01:53:30,321 --> 01:53:32,510
Humans are mostly wonderful,
I think,

2377
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:36,800
but we've got a few of us out there have
been infected with this thing.

2378
01:53:36,801 --> 01:53:39,810
You're talking about us or them,
the team attitude.

2379
01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:40,903
It's me and you.
It's me versus you and this is the 

2380
01:53:43,581 --> 01:53:44,690
problem.
This is the.

2381
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:47,490
This is a real problem.
How do we fix that?

2382
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:48,950
That.
Because it's like,

2383
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:50,900
yeah,
I don't know who caused it.

2384
01:53:51,230 --> 01:53:52,063
That's the thing,
like what are is fucking Harvey 

2385
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:55,640
Weinstein or these,
you know,

2386
01:53:55,641 --> 01:53:59,570
is it because we did teen teen teen boys
aren't getting jerked off enough.

2387
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:03,560
I don't know.
But we do have a problem right now which

2388
01:54:03,561 --> 01:54:08,561
is that there's a lot of people whose 
minds are scrambled with crazy ideas and

2389
01:54:09,501 --> 01:54:11,090
that's okay.
That's okay.

2390
01:54:11,091 --> 01:54:11,924
Back when there were crossbows and shit,
but now that we've got these minds 

2391
01:54:14,831 --> 01:54:19,831
scramble with crazy ideas and access to 
information about how to make fertilizer

2392
01:54:21,051 --> 01:54:23,990
bombs,
how to make the Ivr already heard,

2393
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:24,350
ever happened.

2394
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:25,183
Then with that,
what,

2395
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:27,200
what did what,
where'd you get the fertilizer?

2396
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:29,800
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2397
01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:31,850
So what happened was,
so these cops,

2398
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:33,353
so,
so this one cop is standing next to me 

2399
01:54:35,301 --> 01:54:36,190
and he's like,
oh,

2400
01:54:36,191 --> 01:54:38,390
so you're from the states on what part 
do you live in?

2401
01:54:38,391 --> 01:54:41,720
And we're just chatting and then this 
other cop comes over and he's like,

2402
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:42,823
he's like,
I'm gonna.

2403
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:44,570
Press my camera.
I have to record this,

2404
01:54:44,571 --> 01:54:45,920
you understand that are like,
yes,

2405
01:54:45,921 --> 01:54:48,410
I understand you're recording me and 
anything you say will be used.

2406
01:54:48,411 --> 01:54:48,801
Yeah,
yeah,

2407
01:54:48,801 --> 01:54:52,440
I understand.
And he's real up in my face and like,

2408
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:54,590
I think you're lying to me and giving me
all this shit.

2409
01:54:54,591 --> 01:54:56,270
And then he goes away and the other 
guy's like,

2410
01:54:56,271 --> 01:54:56,991
yeah,
don't worry.

2411
01:54:56,991 --> 01:54:59,690
He's like,
he gets uptight sometimes and I'm like,

2412
01:54:59,691 --> 01:55:00,800
oh,
so you're the good cop.

2413
01:55:00,830 --> 01:55:01,770
Right?
And he's like,

2414
01:55:01,771 --> 01:55:02,421
yeah,
yeah,

2415
01:55:02,421 --> 01:55:03,550
yeah.
And I said,

2416
01:55:03,551 --> 01:55:04,251
all right,
that's fine.

2417
01:55:04,251 --> 01:55:05,690
As long as you're not American cop.

2418
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:06,523
Right.
I'm not worried about it because I knew 

2419
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:10,640
like,
I knew like eventually this was going to

2420
01:55:10,641 --> 01:55:12,200
be just a good story.
Yeah.

2421
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:13,460
And so they're like,
well,

2422
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:14,631
you know,
you're bad.

2423
01:55:14,631 --> 01:55:18,220
Keeps coming back positive.
And they checked my hands and my,

2424
01:55:18,290 --> 01:55:21,860
they wiped my jeans and Shit and they 
said we got to get the dog,

2425
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:23,633
get the dog.
So now I'm waiting there just chatting 

2426
01:55:24,841 --> 01:55:25,940
in the,
bring this dog.

2427
01:55:25,941 --> 01:55:30,050
Brian was the name of the dog and Brian 
sniffed my bag and didn't.

2428
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:31,910
There was nothing.
And so they were like,

2429
01:55:31,930 --> 01:55:32,870
eh.
Brian says,

2430
01:55:32,871 --> 01:55:34,880
you're,
you're good to go that crazy.

2431
01:55:34,881 --> 01:55:37,200
Fuck the equipment,
let's adopt a dog.

2432
01:55:37,590 --> 01:55:38,570
And they're telling me,
and I'm like,

2433
01:55:38,690 --> 01:55:39,890
guys,
there's nothing.

2434
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:40,740
Trust me,
there's,

2435
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:42,650
you can google me,
like I'm not,

2436
01:55:42,651 --> 01:55:43,980
you know,
and they're like,

2437
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:46,800
the machines are never wrong.
They've literally said that.

2438
01:55:46,801 --> 01:55:47,400
And I'm like,
well,

2439
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:48,670
they're wrong this time,
you know,

2440
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:51,060
let's get 50 bucks,
50 pounds,

2441
01:55:51,061 --> 01:55:51,660
you know,
and like,

2442
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:52,493
yeah,
we don't bet.

2443
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:54,660
Anyway,
so finally I was like,

2444
01:55:54,661 --> 01:55:56,040
when the,
when the dog was like,

2445
01:55:56,470 --> 01:55:57,840
you know,
that I was free,

2446
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:01,080
I say,
can I do a group Selfie with you guys?

2447
01:56:01,110 --> 01:56:03,150
Like put it on Instagram,
that'd be pretty funny.

2448
01:56:03,151 --> 01:56:03,870
And they're like,
Nah,

2449
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:07,290
we can't ever faces on right.
But you can take a picture with Brian.

2450
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:11,670
So I got picture with the dog licking my
cheek and Heathrow,

2451
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:12,973
hilarious.

2452
01:56:13,650 --> 01:56:16,390
Bought a laptop once,
red band and uh,

2453
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:19,610
he was selling this windows laptop.
I want it to get a second laptop.

2454
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:24,880
And the first time I used it took it 
through the airport and uh,

2455
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:28,280
it got screened.
So,

2456
01:56:28,281 --> 01:56:30,230
uh,
they pull you aside.

2457
01:56:30,490 --> 01:56:33,350
We're going to have to check this again.
Have you been near farm?

2458
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:35,390
No,
I didn't know what that meant back then.

2459
01:56:35,391 --> 01:56:37,730
I didn't know about the fertilizer.
They checked my hands.

2460
01:56:37,731 --> 01:56:38,564
Nothing.
They swab the entire laptop and they'll 

2461
01:56:40,730 --> 01:56:43,850
test positive for fertilizer and cum 
stains.

2462
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:48,020
It's probably just red bands.
Just fucking a computer.

2463
01:56:48,021 --> 01:56:51,200
But they,
they went over it with a fine tooth comb

2464
01:56:51,201 --> 01:56:52,034
with a swab and they went up and down.
They had asked me a bunch of questions 

2465
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:56,930
and I'll explain what I do.
I'm a comedian,

2466
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:58,670
you know,
a host fear factor.

2467
01:56:58,671 --> 01:56:59,301
And they go,
oh,

2468
01:56:59,301 --> 01:57:00,740
okay.
All right.

2469
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,450
Get outta here.
Just gave it to me.

2470
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:05,960
Gave me the laptop.
Because they recognized you?

2471
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:07,400
Yeah,
because they checked the laptop.

2472
01:57:07,401 --> 01:57:08,720
They,
I said I bought it from a friend.

2473
01:57:08,721 --> 01:57:10,040
This is the work around the farm.
I go,

2474
01:57:10,041 --> 01:57:11,740
I don't think so.
And uh,

2475
01:57:12,050 --> 01:57:12,883
they just tested it and they swapped it 
and whatever the minimal amount of 

2476
01:57:16,791 --> 01:57:20,000
nitrogen or that they found on it,
which exists in fertilizer,

2477
01:57:20,001 --> 01:57:23,210
but also in bombs somehow or another.
But it's also,

2478
01:57:23,211 --> 01:57:25,340
by the way,
nitrogen is the most common thing in the

2479
01:57:25,341 --> 01:57:27,650
air.
The air's 80 percent nitrogen.

2480
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:32,780
How they're getting.
What they're getting off of the laptop,

2481
01:57:33,050 --> 01:57:35,600
I don't know why it would test positive 
or what have you,

2482
01:57:35,601 --> 01:57:39,170
but it was apparently a minimal amount 
in some way,

2483
01:57:39,171 --> 01:57:40,580
shape or form.
They thought it was okay.

2484
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:41,573
I thought they were going to turn it on 
and check the content and you're going 

2485
01:57:43,751 --> 01:57:44,584
to get in trouble for

2486
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:50,280
writing all the shit that I write down 
like the fuck is wrong with your head,

2487
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:54,510
but like if you worked on a farm and you
got that nitrogen shit all over,

2488
01:57:54,511 --> 01:57:55,344
you feel like you were laying down some 
fertilizer and gotten your clothes and 

2489
01:57:57,331 --> 01:57:59,340
you went straight to the airport.
You're not flying anywhere,

2490
01:57:59,341 --> 01:58:00,174
bro.
Yeah.

2491
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:02,850
They check you and they find that shit 
on you.

2492
01:58:03,710 --> 01:58:04,543
You know,
if there's somehow or another it gets 

2493
01:58:05,401 --> 01:58:06,234
detected.
It's touching your bags or something 

2494
01:58:08,581 --> 01:58:09,414
like that.
Like you're gonna you're going to be in 

2495
01:58:10,591 --> 01:58:12,460
for some questioning.
You know?

2496
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:13,890
That sucks man.

2497
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:15,393
So what do you think's gonna happen with
this democratization of weaponry that 

2498
01:58:18,971 --> 01:58:19,804
you were talking about?
Because sometimes I think he could be a 

2499
01:58:21,851 --> 01:58:25,840
good thing if everybody had the capacity
to destroy the planet.

2500
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:27,610
No Way.
It's not a good thing.

2501
01:58:27,611 --> 01:58:30,550
It's like,
well,

2502
01:58:30,580 --> 01:58:31,413
that's where we're going,
where we're going to have to kill the 

2503
01:58:33,761 --> 01:58:35,780
people that we think would possibly 
destroy

2504
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:38,540
on it,
and then everyone's going to be scared.

2505
01:58:38,630 --> 01:58:41,300
It's going to be like mccarthyism for 
nuclear catastrophe.

2506
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:42,040
Everyone's

2507
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,930
going to think that metro our 
destruction,

2508
01:58:44,730 --> 01:58:47,350
which works when one of the,
when both people are saying,

2509
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:48,513
but when you're dealing with someone who
wants to die and like and like these 

2510
01:58:51,341 --> 01:58:52,174
shooters,
when you look at what's happening with 

2511
01:58:52,931 --> 01:58:54,490
these shooters,
like the guy in Vegas,

2512
01:58:54,730 --> 01:58:55,563
that's an example of a lunatic,
getting ahold of some technology and 

2513
01:58:59,981 --> 01:59:00,814
using that technology to wipe out a shit
ton of people not caring if he's going 

2514
01:59:03,801 --> 01:59:04,634
to die.
What if that guy was up there with a 

2515
01:59:05,591 --> 01:59:06,424
fucking Cuban sonic,
dumdum beam just blasting people with 

2516
01:59:10,631 --> 01:59:13,930
this beam that's making them for the 
rest of their lives,

2517
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:16,750
have some kind of neurological 
impairment.

2518
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:17,733
What if that person,
God forbid he was up there like dusting 

2519
01:59:20,021 --> 01:59:23,980
out smallpox that he printed up and his 
three d printer.

2520
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:28,650
It's like the creepy thing about it is 
Chris,

2521
01:59:28,651 --> 01:59:31,090
that there is not a solution.

2522
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:32,253
I don't even know how you,
like we're looking at like huge chunks 

2523
01:59:36,191 --> 01:59:37,024
of the human population that believe 
that in this insane creator force that 

2524
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:45,220
actually wants them to explode 
themselves.

2525
01:59:45,490 --> 01:59:46,780
You know,
they went in and like that,

2526
01:59:47,070 --> 01:59:47,903
that shooting that just happened where 
the isis came in and just fucking 

2527
01:59:51,401 --> 01:59:53,290
executed a bunch of Sufi.
He's,

2528
01:59:53,730 --> 01:59:56,200
you know,
and Egypt and Sufi Islam.

2529
01:59:56,201 --> 01:59:57,220
Like that's,
that's,

2530
01:59:57,550 --> 01:59:58,900
you know,
it's such a,

2531
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:01,300
it's like mystical Islam.
It's beautiful.

2532
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:03,580
It's beautiful dancing.
Yes.

2533
02:00:03,581 --> 02:00:07,510
It's dancing and so,
so we already have this kind of insanity

2534
02:00:07,511 --> 02:00:09,970
bubbling up in different parts of the 
planet.

2535
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:12,370
So in that,
and then you have white,

2536
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:13,233
the loner person who just for whatever 
reason decides to go and shoot up a 

2537
02:00:15,401 --> 02:00:18,340
church or whatever.
This is all like Sam Harris arguments.

2538
02:00:18,830 --> 02:00:19,663
This is Sam Harris believes in when it 
comes to like ideologies being 

2539
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:25,440
incredibly toxic in that form.
Yeah.

2540
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:26,830
They can be,
they can be.

2541
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:27,850
Yeah.
They can be.

2542
02:00:27,851 --> 02:00:30,400
I want to start a fight with Sam Harris,
but I like him.

2543
02:00:30,401 --> 02:00:35,240
It seems like a fun thing to do.
I'm going to get you a few of your.

2544
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:36,753
Hey Mr.

2545
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:39,953
logical focus,
I'll get you for your focus being right 

2546
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:45,960
all the time.
No,

2547
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:46,420
no,
but,

2548
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:47,350
but the um,
the.

2549
02:00:47,351 --> 02:00:49,470
Yeah man,
this is like a,

2550
02:00:50,420 --> 02:00:51,253
this is ai is a big problem,
but also the fact that the current ai 

2551
02:00:55,451 --> 02:00:56,284
that we're running,
the human operating system is like 

2552
02:00:58,541 --> 02:01:01,390
already fucking up in this kind of 
intense way.

2553
02:01:01,730 --> 02:01:02,441
It's,
it's.

2554
02:01:02,441 --> 02:01:05,410
I don't know what the solution is.
No one can really even think about it,

2555
02:01:05,411 --> 02:01:06,940
but it's,
it is going.

2556
02:01:06,970 --> 02:01:10,180
It's a problem in the most intense way.
Well,

2557
02:01:10,181 --> 02:01:11,014
here's how easy the ais to hack Donald 
Trump who's never been religious at any 

2558
02:01:14,111 --> 02:01:17,350
point in his life ever now is able to 
say,

2559
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:18,393
God bless America and everybody starts 
clapping and they believe that he 

2560
02:01:22,961 --> 02:01:25,780
believes that God is blessing of 
America,

2561
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:27,940
which has never been a part of his 
thought process.

2562
02:01:27,941 --> 02:01:28,810
Right?
That's right.

2563
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:33,610
Like there's a giant history of Donald 
Trump interacting with the world.

2564
02:01:33,670 --> 02:01:36,100
Never were.
Was there any proselytizing,

2565
02:01:36,230 --> 02:01:37,063
right?
There's never any espousing or have any 

2566
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:40,400
religious doctrines

2567
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,800
are talking about the greatness of 
Christianity.

2568
02:01:42,801 --> 02:01:43,634
But now he does it and because he's in 
this position where you have to believe 

2569
02:01:46,101 --> 02:01:46,934
it.
We accept that new variation in his 

2570
02:01:48,651 --> 02:01:51,050
speech,
the now he brings God into the equation.

2571
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:53,240
We never brought God into the equation 
before.

2572
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:54,470
That's so creepy,
man.

2573
02:01:54,471 --> 02:01:55,304
The way you just said,
I didn't know what you're talking about 

2574
02:01:56,130 --> 02:01:58,310
because I'm like,
trump definitely didn't hack any fucking

2575
02:01:58,311 --> 02:01:59,810
ai,
but now I hear what you're saying.

2576
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:00,673
Yeah,
yeah.

2577
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:01,793
He's,
he's tapped into this human ai acquire 

2578
02:02:04,390 --> 02:02:09,360
their requirement to believe in 
supernatural beings that are looking out

2579
02:02:09,361 --> 02:02:12,690
for us.
That's a requirement in 2017.

2580
02:02:12,691 --> 02:02:13,524
You cannot.
Like if Chris Ryan wanted to run for 

2581
02:02:14,851 --> 02:02:16,520
president,
one of the real issues,

2582
02:02:16,521 --> 02:02:19,470
it would be as I can't trust an atheist.
Right?

2583
02:02:20,350 --> 02:02:23,130
Oh,
I think that's gonna be the least.

2584
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:26,043
I just read your book.
We got to sit down and talk is I'm not 

2585
02:02:28,621 --> 02:02:29,454
some crazy polygamous monkey person.
Be My first press conference would be a 

2586
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:33,880
doozy.
Let me tell you.

2587
02:02:33,881 --> 02:02:34,714
You're great.

2588
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:35,231
Yeah,
man.

2589
02:02:35,231 --> 02:02:36,670
That's that.
So that,

2590
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:40,480
that is the problem is the human ai.
We're getting better at hacking it.

2591
02:02:40,780 --> 02:02:42,580
You know that.
This is.

2592
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:44,610
I don't think it was St Harris who said 
it though.

2593
02:02:44,611 --> 02:02:46,420
It might've been.
Maybe it was Elon Musk,

2594
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:49,830
he was saying everyone thinks the 
problem with a,

2595
02:02:49,870 --> 02:02:53,590
with ai is that it's going to be robots 
killing people,

2596
02:02:53,591 --> 02:02:54,424
which is one part of it,
but the real problem is that the ai is 

2597
02:02:56,951 --> 02:02:57,784
going to be able to start hacking the 
human operating system and we kind of 

2598
02:03:02,141 --> 02:03:06,250
have already witnessed that with the 
twitter bots.

2599
02:03:06,430 --> 02:03:09,740
So it's like you can produce the uh,
uh,

2600
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:14,760
you can produce the illusion of a 
majority opinion using bots.

2601
02:03:15,011 --> 02:03:15,844
So,
and the more advanced right now you can 

2602
02:03:17,261 --> 02:03:18,094
usually,
you can at least kind of tell what the 

2603
02:03:19,181 --> 02:03:21,790
bots are like.
You go back and look and you realize the

2604
02:03:21,791 --> 02:03:22,624
body has been tweeting every like five 
minutes and it's got like lists of 

2605
02:03:25,811 --> 02:03:28,270
people in it and it's usually tweeting 
memes and it seems to be

2606
02:03:28,270 --> 02:03:29,103
Ben have,
you'd have to chase it down if you just 

2607
02:03:30,311 --> 02:03:32,530
looked at the comments itself after a 
post,

2608
02:03:32,890 --> 02:03:33,723
like say if you're someone who opposes 
president trump and they've got trump 

2609
02:03:36,371 --> 02:03:37,204
bots that they use to go and attack 
someone who says anything bad about 

2610
02:03:40,451 --> 02:03:41,284
trump,
you would just see the overwhelming 

2611
02:03:42,941 --> 02:03:45,250
negative response versus positive.

2612
02:03:45,610 --> 02:03:46,700
Yeah.
Well yeah,

2613
02:03:46,910 --> 02:03:47,743
but you could still,
I guess what I'm saying is like right 

2614
02:03:48,891 --> 02:03:51,560
now there's a way you can tell 
something's a bot,

2615
02:03:51,950 --> 02:03:54,860
but as ai gets better,
you're going to start seeing.

2616
02:03:54,950 --> 02:03:55,783
I've been thinking about this.
You're going to start seeing these 

2617
02:03:57,410 --> 02:03:58,243
basically social networking farmers.
So the idea's like I created a teenage 

2618
02:04:02,391 --> 02:04:03,224
bought in.
I figured out a way to get it to create 

2619
02:04:05,871 --> 02:04:09,380
its own facebook account and for like,
I don't know,

2620
02:04:09,381 --> 02:04:10,214
six years,
it just posts shit on its own facebook 

2621
02:04:13,071 --> 02:04:13,904
account.
Giving the illusion that this is a 

2622
02:04:14,721 --> 02:04:18,470
living thing.
Now if I could do that with 7,000

2623
02:04:18,471 --> 02:04:20,380
of these teen bots,
so now I have a,

2624
02:04:20,390 --> 02:04:25,390
have a bought swarm of 7,000
ais that all have facebook accounts,

2625
02:04:27,021 --> 02:04:27,854
twitter accounts,
instagram accounts that they've been 

2626
02:04:29,811 --> 02:04:33,350
somehow populating with bullshit content
for like seven years.

2627
02:04:33,530 --> 02:04:37,040
So now no one can really even tell if 
it's a person or not.

2628
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:38,280
I've got a really

2629
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:43,280
super powerful weapon and so I think 
that's what's the real creepy thing with

2630
02:04:43,861 --> 02:04:44,970
ai is.
And,

2631
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:45,833
and you know,
you've seen that shit that popped up on 

2632
02:04:46,771 --> 02:04:47,590
the Internet.
The ability.

2633
02:04:47,590 --> 02:04:49,680
Here's a road in the day.
Look,

2634
02:04:49,681 --> 02:04:51,660
we just made it look like it's winter 
now.

2635
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,880
We just made it look like it's nighttime
now.

2636
02:04:53,881 --> 02:04:54,714
We just made it look like it's whatever,
anytime of year that we want we can 

2637
02:04:57,541 --> 02:04:58,374
make.
It's going to get to the point where we 

2638
02:04:58,951 --> 02:05:02,130
can make a person look like they said 
anything and you're not going to be able

2639
02:05:02,131 --> 02:05:04,860
to tell the difference.
And then on top of that,

2640
02:05:04,890 --> 02:05:06,060
that's here.
By the way,

2641
02:05:07,220 --> 02:05:10,860
I think it was radio lab or something 
that did a podcast here.

2642
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:13,590
It's close.
It's discernible,

2643
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:15,150
but it's getting close.
So.

2644
02:05:15,190 --> 02:05:17,970
So we're talking about reality video and
audio.

2645
02:05:18,150 --> 02:05:18,983
Yeah,
it it.

2646
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:20,213
It's reality bombs where you're going to
be able to bomb a culture with ai 

2647
02:05:24,870 --> 02:05:28,110
produced the illusion of anything that 
you fucking want,

2648
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:31,090
whatever you want,
but in dme and people are gonna,

2649
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:33,030
believe it,
but devil's advocate here.

2650
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:34,830
Haven't we been doing that for a long 
time?

2651
02:05:34,860 --> 02:05:37,470
Isn't that what a laugh track is?
A studio audience,

2652
02:05:37,690 --> 02:05:38,523
but it's creating the illusion of 
community of a bunch of people that 

2653
02:05:41,641 --> 02:05:42,474
believe a certain thing that react 
certain ways and that manipulates the 

2654
02:05:45,601 --> 02:05:48,360
hordes.
Bernays wrote about this in the twenties

2655
02:05:48,361 --> 02:05:49,194
about manipulating and effective.
It's already been in its rudimentary 

2656
02:05:52,771 --> 02:05:53,604
form.
Now imagine a super advanced form of 

2657
02:05:56,251 --> 02:05:57,084
that and what you're looking at is like 
the re one of the real problems of ai 

2658
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:03,420
that maybe is more problematic than 
robots going so fast.

2659
02:06:03,421 --> 02:06:05,070
You have to use a strobe light to see 
them.

2660
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:06,173
We're talking about people no longer if 
you believe that anything in the media 

2661
02:06:12,650 --> 02:06:13,483
or on the Internet is real or if you've 
been trying to like establish your 

2662
02:06:16,801 --> 02:06:17,634
concept of what the universe is or the 
world is based on the news based on the 

2663
02:06:21,901 --> 02:06:22,734
Internet and people have been doing that
for a long time with newspapers and 

2664
02:06:24,751 --> 02:06:25,380
shit.

2665
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:29,040
Then we're going to enter into a phase 
in human history where that is no longer

2666
02:06:29,041 --> 02:06:29,874
necessarily a way for us to gauge what 
reality actually is because we're not 

2667
02:06:35,521 --> 02:06:38,400
even gonna know fucking humans are 
creating the content.

2668
02:06:38,610 --> 02:06:39,443
We're not going to get to a certain 
point in time where we're not going to 

2669
02:06:41,281 --> 02:06:43,020
know if someone's human.
Yeah,

2670
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:46,470
blade is a real thing that's going to 
happen.

2671
02:06:46,490 --> 02:06:47,970
Yeah.
That's not far away.

2672
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:51,570
They have some pretty God damn 
convincing robot heads now in Japan.

2673
02:06:51,630 --> 02:06:55,320
Sex robots looking pretty good.
They don't look too bad and we're.

2674
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:56,173
We're getting real close.
We're getting within 50 years away from 

2675
02:06:59,281 --> 02:07:03,600
an indiscernible artificial life form.
Buddy of mine had a wet dream recently.

2676
02:07:04,230 --> 02:07:05,063
He's in his forties and he had a wet 
dream where he was having sex with two 

2677
02:07:10,310 --> 02:07:11,700
revolutions.
Sex robots.

2678
02:07:11,730 --> 02:07:12,563
Oh yeah,
for sure.

2679
02:07:12,850 --> 02:07:13,683
And that chicken,
even though you could see right through 

2680
02:07:16,321 --> 02:07:17,610
her legs,
she was clear.

2681
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:19,970
She had clear arms and shit.
You still fuck shit up.

2682
02:07:20,490 --> 02:07:22,390
Beautiful.
She was nice to you.

2683
02:07:23,790 --> 02:07:25,080
How do you know what is real?
I mean,

2684
02:07:25,081 --> 02:07:27,830
if it interacts with you,
if you're talking to a premier shit,

2685
02:07:28,590 --> 02:07:29,423
here's where it gets really interesting 
is like there's this mystic name 

2686
02:07:32,261 --> 02:07:36,250
Gurdjieff,
and he called people spiritual

2687
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:41,250
machines and so his thing was like most 
people already are.

2688
02:07:42,370 --> 02:07:47,320
Robots are automatons and the sense that
most people when they're doing anything,

2689
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:50,320
whatever the thing is they're doing,
it's imitation.

2690
02:07:50,700 --> 02:07:53,800
So when a person like you know,
does any,

2691
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:56,350
the way a person,
a person who's acting cool,

2692
02:07:56,740 --> 02:07:57,573
right?
Usually the person who is acting cool 

2693
02:07:59,770 --> 02:08:03,220
has Emma is learned that from something.
It's all limitation.

2694
02:08:03,221 --> 02:08:07,150
It's all autopilot already.
So most human beings,

2695
02:08:07,330 --> 02:08:11,070
they're not even autonomous at all.
Like how most of it,

2696
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:12,063
most people will spend like three 
fucking days completely up in their 

2697
02:08:15,341 --> 02:08:17,980
heads.
Not even knowing where they're at.

2698
02:08:17,981 --> 02:08:19,900
I mean,
I know I've been in that situation where

2699
02:08:19,901 --> 02:08:22,210
like sometime will pass and suddenly 
I'll be like,

2700
02:08:22,211 --> 02:08:23,590
wait,
what the fuck?

2701
02:08:23,591 --> 02:08:26,380
I've been in my head for three days 
straight.

2702
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:29,560
I'm running on autopilot.
What's going on here man?

2703
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:31,240
That's like,
how many people are.

2704
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:33,250
They wake up in the morning,
they get their coffee to get in a car.

2705
02:08:33,430 --> 02:08:34,570
They go and do their thing.
They come back,

2706
02:08:34,571 --> 02:08:35,404
they go to bed.
They barely even know what they're 

2707
02:08:36,611 --> 02:08:38,410
doing.
Momentum,

2708
02:08:39,010 --> 02:08:39,910
momentum.
Right?

2709
02:08:39,911 --> 02:08:40,744
So,
so we're already dealing with a kind of 

2710
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:43,713
organic robot,
a meat machine that's barely even aware 

2711
02:08:46,691 --> 02:08:48,310
of what it's doing,
you know,

2712
02:08:48,430 --> 02:08:51,550
which is why I think,
and I know you and I talk about Christ a

2713
02:08:51,551 --> 02:08:53,050
lot,
I'm going to bring it up on your show.

2714
02:08:53,051 --> 02:08:55,570
Again.
When Jesus is being crucified,

2715
02:08:55,571 --> 02:08:56,404
I think one of the most poignant things 
and the new testament is when Jesus is 

2716
02:08:59,271 --> 02:09:00,760
being crucified,
he looks out and he says,

2717
02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:02,380
father,
forgive them.

2718
02:09:02,650 --> 02:09:03,483
They know not what they do.
And a lot of people interpret that as 

2719
02:09:06,581 --> 02:09:07,414
being like they don't know I'm Jesus,
but I think what he's really saying is 

2720
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:12,730
they don't know what they're fucking 
doing,

2721
02:09:12,731 --> 02:09:13,660
man,
period.

2722
02:09:13,690 --> 02:09:15,820
Period.
They're just on autopilot.

2723
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:19,900
They don't know what they're not.
They're barely sentience yet.

2724
02:09:19,990 --> 02:09:21,310
Termites in the mountain.

2725
02:09:21,430 --> 02:09:24,610
Now let's think about what we were 
talking about earlier when we're talking

2726
02:09:24,611 --> 02:09:27,160
about a 50 year old who's trying to grab
it.

2727
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:27,671
No,
no,

2728
02:09:27,671 --> 02:09:30,790
I didn't know if you were passing it.
Give them some of that shit.

2729
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:34,360
When we're talking about 50 year olds or
50 year old movies,

2730
02:09:34,450 --> 02:09:35,283
you know those old movies where men 
smacked women and grabbed them and and 

2731
02:09:37,870 --> 02:09:40,930
how you're seeing these big changes in 
the way people behave.

2732
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:44,950
Now let's go 2000 years ago.
Let's,

2733
02:09:44,980 --> 02:09:45,813
let's,
let's go way back before written things 

2734
02:09:48,190 --> 02:09:49,023
right,
and let's go back before anybody knew 

2735
02:09:50,351 --> 02:09:53,430
how to write things down or read and 
let's imagine

2736
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:55,240
like what is that?
Ten thousand years ago,

2737
02:09:55,241 --> 02:09:56,074
crypt 15,
that was eight for writing rudimentary 

2738
02:09:58,621 --> 02:09:59,454
writing.

2739
02:10:00,150 --> 02:10:01,440
It's all.
It's all insane.

2740
02:10:01,770 --> 02:10:06,770
If you really think about the amount of 
raw change that's happening in our life,

2741
02:10:08,580 --> 02:10:10,980
just what's going on right now with this
whole me too.

2742
02:10:10,981 --> 02:10:11,814
Movement,
the sexual harassment and sexual 

2743
02:10:12,691 --> 02:10:16,200
assault,
an outing of all these predators,

2744
02:10:16,530 --> 02:10:17,700
all of this stuff.
I'm good.

2745
02:10:17,701 --> 02:10:20,040
Just put all this stuff that's happening
now,

2746
02:10:20,041 --> 02:10:24,150
is this,
they get accelerated evolution,

2747
02:10:24,570 --> 02:10:29,570
accelerated cultural compatibility like 
accelerated understanding of it.

2748
02:10:31,050 --> 02:10:34,130
Almost like a,
a new,

2749
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:40,000
a new version of equality because it 
used to be that like you could fuck your

2750
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:42,680
employee because your employee couldn't 
say anything.

2751
02:10:42,710 --> 02:10:43,341
Right?
Right.

2752
02:10:43,341 --> 02:10:44,180
They couldn't do anything.
Well,

2753
02:10:44,181 --> 02:10:45,014
now they can.
Now everybody can and now other people 

2754
02:10:46,731 --> 02:10:48,530
find out about you and now it becomes an
issue.

2755
02:10:49,070 --> 02:10:49,903
It's all forced and so now we're going 
to change the way we think about 

2756
02:10:52,701 --> 02:10:53,534
behaving now and our standards going to 
change because our standards have 

2757
02:10:55,641 --> 02:10:57,740
radically changed from a thousand years 
ago.

2758
02:10:57,890 --> 02:10:58,723
Radically changed from 2000 years ago 
and radically changed from the 19 

2759
02:11:01,491 --> 02:11:03,920
fifties.
If you look at the 19 fifties and we see

2760
02:11:03,921 --> 02:11:04,754
it in uniquely,
so in the 19 fifties is that we can see 

2761
02:11:08,001 --> 02:11:12,020
it in the form of mainstream media 
films.

2762
02:11:12,170 --> 02:11:16,010
You can read about it in books,
but seeing it visually in films,

2763
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:17,233
it's so shocking and stunning and you 
see just the way people interacted with 

2764
02:11:20,481 --> 02:11:21,314
each other and you just think about if 
someone from like 1950 tried to exist 

2765
02:11:24,591 --> 02:11:26,120
today,
it would be hilarious.

2766
02:11:26,210 --> 02:11:27,043
Would be hilarious.
Just watching them try to interact with 

2767
02:11:29,151 --> 02:11:30,860
everybody with phones and all the 
studies.

2768
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:31,873
They literally would be like a person 
from a foreign world that's going to be 

2769
02:11:35,810 --> 02:11:36,643
us a hundred years from now.
One hundred years from now this world 

2770
02:11:39,891 --> 02:11:42,160
will be indiscernible.
It's going.

2771
02:11:42,250 --> 02:11:43,083
The technology is like literally a 
yellowstone about to blow up the entire 

2772
02:11:47,781 --> 02:11:50,630
country that literally about the super 
volcano,

2773
02:11:50,631 --> 02:11:51,464
the whole world,
and no one is prepared for the 

2774
02:11:53,271 --> 02:11:54,104
consequences.
We just assume that the paradigms that 

2775
02:11:56,301 --> 02:11:59,810
exist today are going to remain and that
it's just going to get better.

2776
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,490
It'd be easier to text people.
No,

2777
02:12:01,491 --> 02:12:02,324
no,
no.

2778
02:12:02,470 --> 02:12:03,303
This,
this paradigm did not exist 2000 years 

2779
02:12:05,121 --> 02:12:06,560
ago.
This world,

2780
02:12:06,620 --> 02:12:07,453
the world,
the way we operate and communicate and 

2781
02:12:09,321 --> 02:12:11,630
even get around.
How about the way we get around?

2782
02:12:11,631 --> 02:12:12,464
How about this hard surface and these 
metal boxes of rubber tires and now 

2783
02:12:15,170 --> 02:12:16,640
fucking drive themselves.

2784
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:18,960
I mean we.
We're at the.

2785
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:20,690
We're at,
we're in the middle of it,

2786
02:12:20,810 --> 02:12:23,960
but we're also at the gate to like 
insanity,

2787
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:25,393
pure,
absolute world changing and sandy from 

2788
02:12:27,711 --> 02:12:28,544
DNA with Crispr,
they've just started injecting it into 

2789
02:12:31,341 --> 02:12:32,450
live people.
Now,

2790
02:12:32,510 --> 02:12:35,720
some guy with some incurable disease 
allowed them to Guinea pig on him.

2791
02:12:35,870 --> 02:12:37,820
What if he gets fucking cured?
Right?

2792
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:39,800
What if people figure out a way to get 
smarter?

2793
02:12:39,801 --> 02:12:40,634
What have they developed?
Crispr telekinesis modules where they 

2794
02:12:43,611 --> 02:12:45,590
can insert them into your fucking head 
and use it,

2795
02:12:45,591 --> 02:12:46,424
works off your own body's electricity 
and they never run bad and we all talk 

2796
02:12:50,461 --> 02:12:51,294
to each other through our minds and then
in school they have to teach kids a new 

2797
02:12:53,541 --> 02:12:54,374
language,
a universal language that's not not 

2798
02:12:57,291 --> 02:12:59,570
phonetically based,
so people stopped talking.

2799
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:01,430
So our heads grow big.
Like aliens are.

2800
02:13:01,431 --> 02:13:03,680
Miles shiver up just like the aliens.

2801
02:13:04,010 --> 02:13:05,530
That's what the aliens.
That's what that.

2802
02:13:05,570 --> 02:13:06,403
That archetype is.
That alien archetype is like what we 

2803
02:13:08,991 --> 02:13:11,000
know we're going to look like.
If we keep going,

2804
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:15,220
we're all going to be like a merge of 
colors because that's problematic.

2805
02:13:15,230 --> 02:13:17,360
All that Dick Stuff.
That shit just gets in the way.

2806
02:13:17,361 --> 02:13:20,180
Dude.
Your your database now on your brain.

2807
02:13:20,181 --> 02:13:21,050
Sure.
Well,

2808
02:13:21,051 --> 02:13:21,884
I liked this is the way Mckenna talked 
about how like what he say octupus like 

2809
02:13:25,221 --> 02:13:26,540
that.
Like all the limbs,

2810
02:13:26,541 --> 02:13:29,180
like they build the.
It has to communicate with body language

2811
02:13:29,181 --> 02:13:32,040
is so much more profound than it's like.
Yeah.

2812
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:34,110
Not only are we not going to have this 
form,

2813
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:36,630
we're going to be able to decide any 
form we want,

2814
02:13:36,660 --> 02:13:37,740
any form,
any form,

2815
02:13:37,741 --> 02:13:39,810
anything you want to be,
want to be a fucking octupus.

2816
02:13:40,290 --> 02:13:43,050
Theoretically you could be an optimist 
if we get.

2817
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:44,243
If we get to that point,
if we get to that point also nuclear 

2818
02:13:46,810 --> 02:13:47,643
arsenals,
nuking ourselves or without like actual 

2819
02:13:49,891 --> 02:13:54,030
yellowstone or without like sending out.
Maybe we just haven't produced,

2820
02:13:54,210 --> 02:13:54,660
you know,
we're,

2821
02:13:54,660 --> 02:13:55,493
we always are scanning this guys for 
radio signals or that's what we used to 

2822
02:13:59,131 --> 02:13:59,964
do,
but maybe we haven't even produced a 

2823
02:14:01,321 --> 02:14:02,154
signal than an advanced civilization 
would identify as being something that 

2824
02:14:05,701 --> 02:14:08,730
would come from a civilization.
And the moment we do it,

2825
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:14,000
the moment somebody at cern or somebody 
at Darpa produces some kind of beam that

2826
02:14:14,401 --> 02:14:16,960
emanates from the planet.
It just summons a,

2827
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:22,280
just a fucking legion of like crafts 
that just want to enslave us,

2828
02:14:22,501 --> 02:14:24,600
you know?
You know what I mean?

2829
02:14:24,601 --> 02:14:28,980
It just like the first little like boop,
and then they're ready to harvest them.

2830
02:14:29,290 --> 02:14:30,123
Weirdest thoughts that I've ever had 
about interacting with other aliens or 

2831
02:14:33,161 --> 02:14:36,790
other life forms for another planet is 
not that it's a signal,

2832
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:37,833
it's not that like you you'd like,
but you can go to a place that you can 

2833
02:14:40,871 --> 02:14:44,490
transform,
like whatever your consciousness is into

2834
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:48,760
something that can travel to different 
dementias and that these things exist in

2835
02:14:48,761 --> 02:14:52,750
dimensional planes as much as they exist
in physical locations,

2836
02:14:52,810 --> 02:14:53,643
so maybe it's got a physical location of
a hundred billion light years away or 

2837
02:14:56,411 --> 02:14:57,400
whatever the fuck it is.
Right?

2838
02:14:57,670 --> 02:14:59,890
Yeah,
but it's also right here.

2839
02:14:59,910 --> 02:15:03,300
Yeah,
like in that it's all tied in together.

2840
02:15:03,301 --> 02:15:04,134
Like there's this really rudimentary 
crude physical distance space that we 

2841
02:15:08,801 --> 02:15:09,634
operate in on a daily basis because 
we're still as advanced as we are for 

2842
02:15:12,881 --> 02:15:15,520
earth.
We're still fairly low level in terms of

2843
02:15:16,030 --> 02:15:16,863
the ability to spring forth and entire 
universe from something the size of the 

2844
02:15:20,201 --> 02:15:22,180
head of a pin,
which is what the Big Bang is,

2845
02:15:22,181 --> 02:15:22,360
right?

2846
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:23,193
So some insanely complex webbing of just
insane distance plus potential life 

2847
02:15:30,171 --> 02:15:32,310
forms and different styles of,
of,

2848
02:15:32,370 --> 02:15:33,203
of,
of life that could exist and all these 

2849
02:15:34,451 --> 02:15:35,284
different planets.
Hundreds of billions of known galaxies 

2850
02:15:38,590 --> 02:15:40,000
in the universe.
It's so big.

2851
02:15:40,090 --> 02:15:40,923
Lawrence Krauss tried to explain to me 
the size of the universe and he changed 

2852
02:15:44,081 --> 02:15:44,914
the way I looked at it because he said 
it's not that we know for sure that the 

2853
02:15:49,811 --> 02:15:52,810
universe is 13 point 7 billion years 
old,

2854
02:15:53,020 --> 02:15:56,620
but that's as far back as we can see 
with what we have now.

2855
02:15:56,710 --> 02:15:57,543
And he was saying that time that he was 
trying to make some distinction between 

2856
02:16:02,561 --> 02:16:03,394
the amount of time it would take to go 
back more than 13 point 7 billion years 

2857
02:16:09,130 --> 02:16:09,963
in that time literally moves faster than
that and that you can't detect it after 

2858
02:16:15,821 --> 02:16:16,760
what we're not.
We're,

2859
02:16:16,860 --> 02:16:20,620
we're very limited in our ability to 
detect things after a certain space.

2860
02:16:20,770 --> 02:16:21,603
So he's not necessarily.
The Universe is only 13 point 7 billion 

2861
02:16:23,831 --> 02:16:26,890
years old.
It might be infinitely old.

2862
02:16:27,130 --> 02:16:28,840
It's like that's as far as we can see 
what their.

2863
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:30,100
So we assume

2864
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:30,750
that's all there is.

2865
02:16:30,750 --> 02:16:32,910
Well that's what they have to operate 
on.

2866
02:16:32,911 --> 02:16:34,050
What they can prove now.
Right?

2867
02:16:34,051 --> 02:16:34,884
So this is what they're saying.
What we can prove now is that light is 

2868
02:16:38,040 --> 02:16:38,873
the light.
We're getting is 13 point 7 billion 

2869
02:16:40,891 --> 02:16:41,724
years old or the radio waves that 
indicate that there was some sort of an 

2870
02:16:43,921 --> 02:16:47,250
explosion,
but all of it is like super sketchy man.

2871
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:50,340
They're writing things down on a little 
legal notepad.

2872
02:16:50,370 --> 02:16:51,203
They're all agreeing with the math and 
looking at it and they're way fucking 

2873
02:16:53,551 --> 02:16:56,430
smarter than me,
so they're probably right about a lot of

2874
02:16:56,431 --> 02:16:57,264
stuff,
but it's entirely possible that just we 

2875
02:16:58,711 --> 02:17:02,880
don't have the ability to detect how 
much further it actually goes back.

2876
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:03,933
Might have this whole faulty assumption 
of this initial beginning of the 

2877
02:17:07,891 --> 02:17:12,060
universe might be bullshit.
There might literally not have ever been

2878
02:17:12,061 --> 02:17:14,040
a beginning because it has always been 
here.

2879
02:17:14,041 --> 02:17:14,420
Right?

2880
02:17:14,420 --> 02:17:15,253
Well,
in my area they've been saying 

2881
02:17:16,250 --> 02:17:19,550
anatomically modern human beings have 
existed for 200,000

2882
02:17:19,551 --> 02:17:20,780
years.
That's what everybody,

2883
02:17:20,781 --> 02:17:22,370
including me,
rights in the books,

2884
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:23,233
you know the accepted wisdom couple 
months ago they found remains in 

2885
02:17:26,361 --> 02:17:28,880
Morocco.
That seemed to be about 300,000

2886
02:17:28,881 --> 02:17:31,710
years old that appear to be from 
anatomically modern human.

2887
02:17:31,711 --> 02:17:32,544
So it's like,
oh,

2888
02:17:32,930 --> 02:17:33,763
well.
So when you say something goes back 

2889
02:17:36,261 --> 02:17:38,020
while you've had Graham Hancock on a 
lot,

2890
02:17:38,030 --> 02:17:38,863
right,
where you say something goes back a 

2891
02:17:39,441 --> 02:17:40,274
certain amount of time,
often what you're saying is that's how 

2892
02:17:41,721 --> 02:17:44,330
far back we.
We found something for that.

2893
02:17:44,331 --> 02:17:47,030
We can detect it in the case of the 
space exploration.

2894
02:17:47,170 --> 02:17:49,690
Insane.
And here's what's really insane.

2895
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:52,240
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt.
Let's go half a million.

2896
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:54,280
That's not.
Yeah,

2897
02:17:54,370 --> 02:17:56,710
it's a blink of an eye.
A half a million years ago.

2898
02:17:56,711 --> 02:18:00,700
We were literally some kind of eighth 
thing half a million years ago,

2899
02:18:00,701 --> 02:18:01,271
right?
Yeah.

2900
02:18:01,271 --> 02:18:02,410
Well we,
Australia pithy,

2901
02:18:02,411 --> 02:18:03,520
that gets 2 million years ago.

2902
02:18:05,930 --> 02:18:07,220
Australopithecus,
you know,

2903
02:18:07,221 --> 02:18:08,054
I stick with anatomically modern humans,
which is why that really jumps out at 

2904
02:18:11,631 --> 02:18:12,411
me.
But yeah,

2905
02:18:12,411 --> 02:18:14,540
I'm not real clear on Australia,
Perth,

2906
02:18:14,630 --> 02:18:17,240
the kiss and Cro Magnon.
And uh,

2907
02:18:17,241 --> 02:18:19,850
I know neanderthals lived up to about 
40,000

2908
02:18:19,851 --> 02:18:21,880
years ago.
Can interbred with human.

2909
02:18:21,980 --> 02:18:23,270
How crazy is that one?
Yeah.

2910
02:18:23,540 --> 02:18:26,540
So that means there was some sort of 
like cultures,

2911
02:18:26,750 --> 02:18:29,300
there was some sort of like villages and
shit back then.

2912
02:18:29,690 --> 02:18:31,710
Now stop and think how crazy that is.
And we're,

2913
02:18:31,711 --> 02:18:32,544
we're,
we're talking about like Mesopotamia or 

2914
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:34,733
mayor or a rack,
we're talking about these incredibly 

2915
02:18:37,401 --> 02:18:38,234
advanced for the time civilizations that
are like the oldest known modern style 

2916
02:18:42,651 --> 02:18:44,600
civilizations,
early 6,000

2917
02:18:44,601 --> 02:18:45,860
years old.
I know.

2918
02:18:45,861 --> 02:18:47,690
It's crazy.
It's so crazy.

2919
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:48,833
And the other thing,
I actually had an idea for a book which 

2920
02:18:50,910 --> 02:18:53,040
the rate I write,
I'll never live to write it,

2921
02:18:53,041 --> 02:18:58,020
but the idea is to look at the known 
unknowns in science,

2922
02:18:58,021 --> 02:18:58,854
right?
Because there are things that are you 

2923
02:19:00,150 --> 02:19:02,220
elucidated and example earlier where 
it's like,

2924
02:19:02,580 --> 02:19:03,413
look,
that's how far we can detect that 

2925
02:19:04,561 --> 02:19:06,720
doesn't mean that's how far it is.
So we know,

2926
02:19:06,721 --> 02:19:07,680
we don't know that

2927
02:19:08,070 --> 02:19:08,903
there's a lot of arrogance in the 
assumption that we have all the data 

2928
02:19:11,521 --> 02:19:14,550
when it comes to the civilizations to 
like how old they are.

2929
02:19:14,570 --> 02:19:17,550
Like who you're,
you're weird going into 6,000

2930
02:19:17,551 --> 02:19:18,384
years,
you're not getting a lot of stuff when 

2931
02:19:19,741 --> 02:19:22,650
you go for thousand years before that 
you're getting way less stuff.

2932
02:19:23,070 --> 02:19:24,510
You go 4,000
years before that.

2933
02:19:24,511 --> 02:19:26,110
You might not have any stuff left.
Right?

2934
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:28,290
Right.
There might be like some shards of metal

2935
02:19:28,291 --> 02:19:30,650
that you can explain and you can carbon 
date those anyway.

2936
02:19:30,651 --> 02:19:33,650
Right.
And I think rock you can carbon date.

2937
02:19:33,651 --> 02:19:36,350
You need like physical things later,
like living right,

2938
02:19:36,351 --> 02:19:39,440
like you need like wood or food for 
carbon,

2939
02:19:39,710 --> 02:19:41,630
carbon dating.
Is that how they're doing it still?

2940
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:42,710
No,
I think there's a,

2941
02:19:42,711 --> 02:19:44,090
there's some other,
uh,

2942
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:47,210
isotope that they're using that they 
don't need the carbon,

2943
02:19:47,440 --> 02:19:50,840
the carbon is accepted and the other 
one's quite new.

2944
02:19:51,170 --> 02:19:53,240
It's pretty fucking crazy.
They were so smart,

2945
02:19:53,241 --> 02:19:57,170
not us obviously,
but someone out there is so smart.

2946
02:19:57,560 --> 02:20:01,640
They could take a piece of something and
tell you roughly how old it is.

2947
02:20:02,170 --> 02:20:03,003
That's fucking nuts.
And apparently gets a little screwy in 

2948
02:20:06,380 --> 02:20:07,213
places where there's higher levels of 
carbon and there's like some weirdness 

2949
02:20:10,551 --> 02:20:11,384
to it,
especially initially when it was first 

2950
02:20:12,201 --> 02:20:14,360
invented,
but just the fact that that exists,

2951
02:20:14,510 --> 02:20:15,350
that someone could say,
oh,

2952
02:20:15,530 --> 02:20:19,220
well we found out that the dinosaurs 
died 65 million years ago.

2953
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:21,410
You're like,
what the fuck?

2954
02:20:21,411 --> 02:20:26,411
Do you know that Chesney fuck?
Did you figure that out?

2955
02:20:28,060 --> 02:20:31,160
And and meanwhile,
probably a hundred years from now,

2956
02:20:31,161 --> 02:20:33,830
they'll have something that'll tell you 
that day the asteroid hit,

2957
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:35,113
they'll,
they'll show you like a model of the 

2958
02:20:36,771 --> 02:20:37,604
Yucatan before and after.
You'll be able to watch it with the HTC 

2959
02:20:39,951 --> 02:20:41,510
Vive,
put it over your head.

2960
02:20:41,511 --> 02:20:46,220
You'll be able to literally watch an 
accurate representation of that giant.

2961
02:20:46,220 --> 02:20:48,210
Was it five miles wide?
Yeah.

2962
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:49,093
The crater.
The action asteroid itself that killed 

2963
02:20:51,501 --> 02:20:52,520
all the dinosaurs.
Yeah.

2964
02:20:52,610 --> 02:20:55,880
I want to say it was five miles wide,
but it might be making that up.

2965
02:20:56,300 --> 02:20:57,133
Five.
Imagine five mile wide city slamming 

2966
02:21:00,621 --> 02:21:02,450
into the earth,
going 45,000

2967
02:21:02,451 --> 02:21:03,284
miles an hour from space and you could 
watch it all take place in virtual 

2968
02:21:06,021 --> 02:21:07,550
reality.
That's going to happen.

2969
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:09,113
You gotta be able to see it.
You're going to literally witness the 

2970
02:21:11,421 --> 02:21:12,254
people coming off the mayflower and 
clubbing native Americans and raping 

2971
02:21:15,171 --> 02:21:16,004
them and killing them.
You will be able to literally see 

2972
02:21:17,990 --> 02:21:19,910
westworld.
You Seen Westworld?

2973
02:21:20,110 --> 02:21:21,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

2974
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:23,090
It's intense,
but I mean,

2975
02:21:23,091 --> 02:21:27,120
I think that they're going to be able to
recreate things in.

2976
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:30,530
As computing power gets more and more 
power.

2977
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:31,393
The only real problem would be things 
that really prehistorical in terms of 

2978
02:21:34,131 --> 02:21:36,890
like cultural things,
maybe not like physical animal things,

2979
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:37,933
but as far as like things that people 
did or didn't do because they vary so 

2980
02:21:40,131 --> 02:21:43,130
much,
it'd be so hard to pin down without real

2981
02:21:43,430 --> 02:21:47,660
accurate like images and videos,
but from here on out,

2982
02:21:48,020 --> 02:21:48,853
from here on out there,
they're going to be able to have 

2983
02:21:51,411 --> 02:21:55,160
recreations of things that happened that
are going to be indistinguishable.

2984
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:58,640
They have images of all of us.
Everybody has a facebook page.

2985
02:21:58,730 --> 02:22:00,210
Everybody has a picture of you.
Alright,

2986
02:22:00,260 --> 02:22:04,460
so the 300 billion,
whatever it will be in 100 years,

2987
02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:07,820
320 million people that exist in this 
country right now.

2988
02:22:07,850 --> 02:22:08,683
There's a probably a picture of 
everybody that that was not the case a 

2989
02:22:12,380 --> 02:22:13,213
hundred years ago.
Right?

2990
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:15,560
In the future,
there's going to be some sort of a three

2991
02:22:15,561 --> 02:22:16,394
dimensional version of you that you use 
as an Avatar and you three d games and 

2992
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:20,913
that's going to look exactly like you 
and they're going to be able to make 

2993
02:22:23,451 --> 02:22:26,040
something that literally recreates

2994
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:27,210
moments in your life.
Well,

2995
02:22:27,211 --> 02:22:28,044
they're gonna.
Be able to like take your social 

2996
02:22:29,101 --> 02:22:29,934
thumbprint.
They're going to be able to 

2997
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:34,380
theoretically they could scan all your 
instagram posts or facebook posts,

2998
02:22:34,381 --> 02:22:36,510
all your tweets,
even your podcast,

2999
02:22:36,511 --> 02:22:39,120
analyze your voice,
get an idea of your personality,

3000
02:22:39,121 --> 02:22:42,480
construct some kind of massive amount of
data,

3001
02:22:42,481 --> 02:22:43,314
feed it to an ai,
say create a personality based on this 

3002
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:48,150
person,
here's their picture,

3003
02:22:48,330 --> 02:22:49,163
animate the picture and now you've 
cloned yourself in ai is like basically 

3004
02:22:53,041 --> 02:22:53,874
imbued all the data that exists and has 
been used to imbue an image of you with 

3005
02:22:59,251 --> 02:23:02,430
your personality and now you are living 
in some kind of simulator,

3006
02:23:02,431 --> 02:23:06,480
which means that you're going to be able
to anyone who has ever had their picture

3007
02:23:06,481 --> 02:23:11,481
taken and as some kind of data out there
to establish some kind of personality.

3008
02:23:12,060 --> 02:23:14,640
You're gonna.
Be able to use that to make a.

3009
02:23:14,730 --> 02:23:18,630
to simulate individuals that have lived 
in the past and do it.

3010
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:21,600
It's going to get really interesting 
ethically because it's like,

3011
02:23:21,601 --> 02:23:23,400
all right,
let me fucking take.

3012
02:23:23,401 --> 02:23:24,420
Like,
I dunno,

3013
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:26,310
he's somebody out there with like a huge
social.

3014
02:23:26,311 --> 02:23:28,110
Like,
let me take Taylor swift.

3015
02:23:28,111 --> 02:23:29,820
Right?
I'm going to take her.

3016
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:30,833
I'm gonna have my ai produce a mini 
Taylor swift and I'm going to drop her 

3017
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:36,413
into like a simulated reality filled 
with fire breathing scorpions to see 

3018
02:23:41,011 --> 02:23:41,844
what Taylor swift would do if she was 
like running through some doom 

3019
02:23:44,761 --> 02:23:45,594
simulator.
They're gonna have to come up with laws 

3020
02:23:47,341 --> 02:23:49,200
about this,
which is like you don't,

3021
02:23:49,201 --> 02:23:52,650
you can't duplicate,
you can't duplicate without permission.

3022
02:23:52,950 --> 02:23:53,783
You know,
talked about them on the podcast before 

3023
02:23:54,871 --> 02:23:56,130
with robots.
We were like,

3024
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:56,993
what's going to stop you from making a 
replica of say Jennifer Lopez for a sex 

3025
02:24:00,331 --> 02:24:02,550
robot?
It looks exactly like Jennifer Lopez and

3026
02:24:02,551 --> 02:24:03,900
is that a violation of her?

3027
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:05,430
You go over,
you know,

3028
02:24:05,460 --> 02:24:06,293
you go to the store and you could 
literally buy a Jennifer Lopez fucked 

3029
02:24:09,211 --> 02:24:10,860
all.
It looks indistinguishable.

3030
02:24:10,861 --> 02:24:13,010
You take it home and you fucked Jennifer
Lowe more like,

3031
02:24:13,050 --> 02:24:13,883
more than likely it's going to be.
You're going to have some kind of like 

3032
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:17,033
what you would have,
I guess would be some kind of generic 

3033
02:24:18,961 --> 02:24:19,794
looking fucked all,
but you put ai goggles on or augmented 

3034
02:24:23,521 --> 02:24:28,380
reality goggles on it projects,
whoever you want onto this thing.

3035
02:24:28,381 --> 02:24:29,260
So it's like you don't have,
you don't,

3036
02:24:29,261 --> 02:24:32,340
you wouldn't go buy a fucked all based 
on a celebrity.

3037
02:24:32,490 --> 02:24:33,323
You would just have some kind of like 
basically a screen in the form of an 

3038
02:24:37,351 --> 02:24:42,351
android that your augmented reality 
would project a person onto that.

3039
02:24:42,661 --> 02:24:45,000
So it kind of in love.
Yeah.

3040
02:24:45,060 --> 02:24:46,080
Yeah.
Well I mean that's the,

3041
02:24:46,220 --> 02:24:49,260
that's where it gets a deal person on 
doesn't want.

3042
02:24:49,300 --> 02:24:50,133
And that's where it gets really fucking 
weird is that's the other thing that 

3043
02:24:51,980 --> 02:24:55,020
you're going to be able to do is you're 
gonna be able to sit across from someone

3044
02:24:55,320 --> 02:24:56,153
and project onto them.
Anyone that you want so that no longer 

3045
02:25:00,350 --> 02:25:01,170
you know,
you'll,

3046
02:25:01,170 --> 02:25:03,120
you'll be talking to western Winston 
Churchill,

3047
02:25:03,460 --> 02:25:04,690
your girlfriend.
Exactly.

3048
02:25:04,710 --> 02:25:08,370
You and I could,
could cope project something onto Joe.

3049
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:11,580
Could be like a game we'd play together.
Yeah.

3050
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:12,533
Well especially if we all decided to 
live in virtual reality and if we spent 

3051
02:25:15,151 --> 02:25:18,960
most of our time alone in a room,
but we felt like we were all hanging out

3052
02:25:18,961 --> 02:25:19,794
together and the feeling is 
indistinguishable than being in a 

3053
02:25:22,621 --> 02:25:24,210
physical location.
Right.

3054
02:25:24,390 --> 02:25:25,870
This is going to be a lot of that going 
on,

3055
02:25:25,871 --> 02:25:27,760
man.
Then you don't need a body anymore.

3056
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:30,490
We're going to get super close to the 
alien thing,

3057
02:25:30,491 --> 02:25:31,324
man.
We're going to engineer big giant heads 

3058
02:25:33,060 --> 02:25:33,893
and we're all going to exist in there.
There's going to be htc vives built was 

3059
02:25:36,550 --> 02:25:38,440
no more atmosphere.
We're going to blow out the atmosphere.

3060
02:25:38,441 --> 02:25:41,110
So we have built in sunglasses.
That's why the aliens have the big black

3061
02:25:41,111 --> 02:25:43,720
eyes.
Those are like bill built in ray band.

3062
02:25:43,721 --> 02:25:46,610
Wayfair's.
Yeah,

3063
02:25:46,910 --> 02:25:47,743
dude,
I think it's brought to you by ray ban 

3064
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:54,910
skin that doesn't get cancer.
It's bulletproof to figure that out.

3065
02:25:54,940 --> 02:25:55,773
Don't you think this is like when you,
when you smoked DMT and I've never 

3066
02:25:59,921 --> 02:26:02,860
smoked dmt and I never would do any 
illegal psychedelic,

3067
02:26:02,861 --> 02:26:06,820
but let's say that I had,
let's say that I had recently done it at

3068
02:26:06,840 --> 02:26:07,720
like,
I don't know,

3069
02:26:07,721 --> 02:26:10,180
burning man where no one's doing drugs 
there anymore,

3070
02:26:10,181 --> 02:26:13,190
but let's say that I had done it there,
but I,

3071
02:26:14,620 --> 02:26:18,910
they're so confused anymore.
Back in the old days,

3072
02:26:19,110 --> 02:26:21,580
it was like,
so making up that I had had that I had a

3073
02:26:21,581 --> 02:26:22,414
crazy

3074
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:23,920
man where,
uh,

3075
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:29,520
I looked down after drinking this very 
strong mint tea and I saw this,

3076
02:26:31,400 --> 02:26:34,240
I saw this fucking,
I don't know,

3077
02:26:34,250 --> 02:26:36,140
it looked like a,
it was a look,

3078
02:26:36,190 --> 02:26:39,490
kind of like a cow or something,
but coming out of it,

3079
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:44,300
it had this long neck with like a 
technological lantern hanging off of it.

3080
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:47,450
And I'm looking at that thing.
And what's interesting about dmts,

3081
02:26:47,480 --> 02:26:51,230
you look away and he looked back now 
fucking things still there,

3082
02:26:51,231 --> 02:26:52,400
man.
It's just right there.

3083
02:26:52,401 --> 02:26:53,234
I'm like,
what the fuck got sucked through this 

3084
02:26:55,460 --> 02:27:00,460
tube into this beautiful,
beautiful domed structure.

3085
02:27:03,740 --> 02:27:04,573
Oh Man.
It was so pretty and it was just 

3086
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:07,333
spinning with potential.
It's just pure potentiality and I'm 

3087
02:27:10,401 --> 02:27:13,940
looking at this incredible thing.
It's technology for sure.

3088
02:27:13,941 --> 02:27:14,481
I mean,
whatever.

3089
02:27:14,481 --> 02:27:17,690
This was the way my brain was 
interpreting it as like,

3090
02:27:17,691 --> 02:27:18,524
this is technology.
Like I'm looking at some kind of super 

3091
02:27:20,721 --> 02:27:21,554
advanced simulator or some kind of 
machine that is like simulating 

3092
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:26,720
realities and I'm looking at it.

3093
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:27,321
It's like,
my God,

3094
02:27:27,321 --> 02:27:30,350
it's just so much potential here,
but I thought to myself,

3095
02:27:31,160 --> 02:27:34,670
I'm going to miss my friends if I have 
to hang out in this place,

3096
02:27:34,671 --> 02:27:38,180
because the interesting thing about dmt 
is that there's a sense of,

3097
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:39,073
or I've heard other people report this,
a sense of incredible familiarity or 

3098
02:27:42,351 --> 02:27:44,510
you're like,
I have been here.

3099
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:45,433
In fact this is home,
and then you realize that feeling of 

3100
02:27:47,121 --> 02:27:47,954
coming home is actually this is that 
it's not even close to the feeling of 

3101
02:27:51,921 --> 02:27:55,010
being at home here and I'm looking 
around at this and thinking,

3102
02:27:56,210 --> 02:27:56,961
yeah,
but my friends,

3103
02:27:56,961 --> 02:27:58,340
my friends,
what about all my friends?

3104
02:27:58,341 --> 02:27:59,630
I'm going to,
I'm in this space,

3105
02:27:59,631 --> 02:28:01,220
I'm going to miss them,
and that thing,

3106
02:28:01,221 --> 02:28:02,570
it doesn't talk to you,
but it's like,

3107
02:28:02,571 --> 02:28:04,700
might as well be a voice is like,
oh,

3108
02:28:05,300 --> 02:28:06,133
oh,
you can always go back there and then I 

3109
02:28:07,611 --> 02:28:10,400
open my eyes and I'm back at burning 
man,

3110
02:28:10,401 --> 02:28:13,220
hanging out with my friends and that's 
when I realized,

3111
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:15,440
Oh fuck,
I get reincarnation,

3112
02:28:15,441 --> 02:28:15,740
man.

3113
02:28:15,740 --> 02:28:16,573
I get it.
This thing you're talking about the 

3114
02:28:17,301 --> 02:28:18,134
simulator that is going to happen 
sometimes after having taken 

3115
02:28:21,861 --> 02:28:22,521
psychedelics.
You think,

3116
02:28:22,521 --> 02:28:22,731
no,
no,

3117
02:28:22,731 --> 02:28:23,564
no,
it's already fucking happened and this 

3118
02:28:25,851 --> 02:28:30,560
thing that we're in right now are alive.
The idea of reincarnation is you die and

3119
02:28:30,561 --> 02:28:34,160
then you become a goat or something 
crazy like that larva slug,

3120
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:35,233
but what if it's that you die.
You pop into that dmt realm and you get 

3121
02:28:39,471 --> 02:28:43,490
to jump back into your life at any frame
of your life that you want to.

3122
02:28:43,850 --> 02:28:46,580
You can.
You can actually repopulate your life or

3123
02:28:46,581 --> 02:28:50,090
reincarnate your life at any moment.
So you die.

3124
02:28:50,091 --> 02:28:53,840
You become the universal 
superintelligence and then you gaze back

3125
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:54,913
into what happened,
and usually it's like in Buddhism they 

3126
02:28:56,961 --> 02:28:58,790
say the cause of suffering is 
attachment.

3127
02:28:58,970 --> 02:29:01,820
That that what you're attached to that 
life,

3128
02:29:01,821 --> 02:29:02,654
this thing you just were this fucking 
interdimensional temporal worm that 

3129
02:29:06,291 --> 02:29:09,170
burrowed through time with every action 
that you took and you're like,

3130
02:29:10,020 --> 02:29:10,880
yeah,
well you're just.

3131
02:29:10,890 --> 02:29:11,511
You.
You're like,

3132
02:29:11,511 --> 02:29:12,344
I want to go back.
I want to go back to this moment right 

3133
02:29:14,271 --> 02:29:15,104
now,
and I was podcasts when my pals doing a 

3134
02:29:16,761 --> 02:29:19,160
shrimp parade and then boom,
there you are.

3135
02:29:19,161 --> 02:29:21,860
You're back back in your life.
So in any given moment,

3136
02:29:22,040 --> 02:29:25,730
you could be reincarnating a million 
fucking times.

3137
02:29:25,731 --> 02:29:26,564
You could just be like always coming 
back to any frame of your life that you 

3138
02:29:29,481 --> 02:29:30,950
want.
And anyway,

3139
02:29:30,951 --> 02:29:32,360
this is what came to me out there in the
desert.

3140
02:29:32,361 --> 02:29:32,901
And I was thinking,
oh,

3141
02:29:32,901 --> 02:29:35,480
I get it.
It's not like you reincarnate into other

3142
02:29:35,481 --> 02:29:38,210
life forms.
You keep repeating your life,

3143
02:29:38,450 --> 02:29:41,480
but it's not a circle.
It's a spiral hopefully,

3144
02:29:41,690 --> 02:29:44,300
because each time you can improve a 
little bit more,

3145
02:29:44,510 --> 02:29:45,343
you can improve a little bit more,
make decisions that you normally 

3146
02:29:47,601 --> 02:29:48,710
wouldn't make.
Which is why,

3147
02:29:48,711 --> 02:29:49,544
like at any given moment,
you know the big moments that come when 

3148
02:29:52,761 --> 02:29:55,850
you're around somebody and you're about 
to say some shitty fucking thing to,

3149
02:29:55,851 --> 02:29:56,661
um,
you know,

3150
02:29:56,661 --> 02:29:59,810
your enemy,
your whoever it may be that moment where

3151
02:29:59,811 --> 02:30:02,210
you're like about to do the fucking 
thing you always do.

3152
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:03,433
And you can feel it like you're.
You feel this gravitational pull to the 

3153
02:30:05,871 --> 02:30:08,270
habituation.
And in that moment you're like,

3154
02:30:08,330 --> 02:30:11,840
you don't say the shitty thing.
And that moment you discipline yourself,

3155
02:30:11,841 --> 02:30:14,090
you control yourself.
You don't do the thing.

3156
02:30:14,091 --> 02:30:16,760
You've always done whatever it is.
And in that moment,

3157
02:30:16,761 --> 02:30:20,960
your life spirals up a little bit and 
now you're existing in like a completely

3158
02:30:20,961 --> 02:30:24,720
new new,
like essentially a new universe plan.

3159
02:30:24,860 --> 02:30:27,400
What you hit a higher place.
Exactly.

3160
02:30:27,410 --> 02:30:28,243
That's kind of in a way that replicates 
what you talk about sometimes on your 

3161
02:30:31,311 --> 02:30:32,990
social media.
I see on your instagram,

3162
02:30:33,380 --> 02:30:35,990
like taming the inner bitch you have the
thing.

3163
02:30:35,991 --> 02:30:36,950
The other day he was like,
you know,

3164
02:30:36,951 --> 02:30:39,160
I really do not want to do this today.
You know,

3165
02:30:39,161 --> 02:30:40,080
you got up,
you know,

3166
02:30:40,180 --> 02:30:42,650
after you do the show the night before,
whatever.

3167
02:30:43,010 --> 02:30:44,630
And you did it.
And at the end of it,

3168
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:49,700
by doing that thing you didn't want to 
do or not doing the thing you do want to

3169
02:30:49,701 --> 02:30:50,120
do.

3170
02:30:50,120 --> 02:30:53,960
Conversely you do move to a higher level
and feel way better use.

3171
02:30:53,990 --> 02:30:54,741
And,
and that.

3172
02:30:54,741 --> 02:30:56,310
So that thing,
that thing you,

3173
02:30:56,380 --> 02:30:57,830
you,
you instagrammed,

3174
02:30:58,430 --> 02:30:59,263
um,
which I think is super cool thing that 

3175
02:31:00,321 --> 02:31:04,010
you do because I think it's like,
a lot of people need to like think,

3176
02:31:04,011 --> 02:31:05,040
yeah man,
I could fucking.

3177
02:31:05,060 --> 02:31:06,960
Anytime I want.
I could just start jogging and.

3178
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:10,460
But it's like you could like really,
you could,

3179
02:31:10,490 --> 02:31:13,040
you just start doing it.
You don't even have to be good at it.

3180
02:31:13,290 --> 02:31:14,780
You don't have to do anything.
Could just make sure,

3181
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:17,300
make sure you do it.
If you just do that,

3182
02:31:17,301 --> 02:31:19,890
everything changes for the better.
And that seems easy.

3183
02:31:19,891 --> 02:31:20,040
It

3184
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:20,873
seems so ridiculous.
But you need to hear people say it and 

3185
02:31:22,891 --> 02:31:25,260
you need to hear someone say it.
Who actually does it?

3186
02:31:25,290 --> 02:31:28,080
Yes.
Now that you know Rupert Sheldrake,

3187
02:31:28,081 --> 02:31:29,850
I think you might have had them on.
Oh,

3188
02:31:29,851 --> 02:31:30,361
cool.
Okay.

3189
02:31:30,361 --> 02:31:32,940
So you know his idea of the Ronnell and 
the timespace content,

3190
02:31:32,980 --> 02:31:37,410
he calls it a runnel basically.
So that feeling when you're like,

3191
02:31:37,411 --> 02:31:38,670
fuck,
I'm not going to have a writing.

3192
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:40,880
You're not just feeling your own,
like,

3193
02:31:41,010 --> 02:31:43,260
you know,
lack of ambition or laziness.

3194
02:31:43,470 --> 02:31:45,270
You're literally feeling.
Now again,

3195
02:31:45,450 --> 02:31:47,610
I don't believe it's just like a thought
experiment or whatever,

3196
02:31:47,611 --> 02:31:52,611
but you're literally feeling the 
gravitational pull of infinite lifetimes

3197
02:31:53,031 --> 02:31:55,230
where in that moment you decided not to 
go running.

3198
02:31:55,231 --> 02:31:56,064
You're actually feeling like the track 
that you've carved deep into the time 

3199
02:31:59,791 --> 02:32:03,630
space continuum by every time that 
moment appears you keep making,

3200
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:04,613
so when you actually do go,
I'm going to go fucking running your 

3201
02:32:07,411 --> 02:32:08,244
kind of climbing out of this trench that
you've dug into time over countless 

3202
02:32:12,631 --> 02:32:16,020
incarnations and when you do that and 
you're out there running,

3203
02:32:16,530 --> 02:32:18,560
you're like in a new dimension.
Now you're like,

3204
02:32:18,580 --> 02:32:20,670
what the fuck?
This is the dimension where I decided to

3205
02:32:20,671 --> 02:32:25,140
go running and then that and that's why 
everything starts changing a little bit.

3206
02:32:25,141 --> 02:32:27,910
When you make these decisions,
big life changing moves.

3207
02:32:28,490 --> 02:32:30,900
Those are good for you and for some 
people going out.

3208
02:32:30,930 --> 02:32:31,763
Jogging can be a life changing move.
It doesn't have to be some spectacular 

3209
02:32:35,551 --> 02:32:36,770
thing.
It can be as simple as

3210
02:32:37,220 --> 02:32:38,053
taking a yoga class,
deciding to take a yoga class twice a 

3211
02:32:40,400 --> 02:32:41,990
week or three times a week and change 
your life.

3212
02:32:42,020 --> 02:32:47,020
Calling someone who you've said some 
shitty thing too because they're.

3213
02:32:47,240 --> 02:32:48,073
They did something wrong and a Po and 
being the bigger person apologizing 

3214
02:32:52,010 --> 02:32:55,430
instead of holding that stupid garage,
calling them up and being like,

3215
02:32:55,431 --> 02:32:56,840
Hey,
I'm sorry.

3216
02:32:57,080 --> 02:32:59,210
I was fucking mad.
I love you.

3217
02:32:59,211 --> 02:33:00,044
You're great.
Instead of like carrying on with this 

3218
02:33:02,270 --> 02:33:06,380
stupid angry war carousel and the 
carousel.

3219
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:11,560
Anytime you make decisions like that,
things get better so fast and then like,

3220
02:33:11,751 --> 02:33:13,220
I don't know if you've noticed that 
there's,

3221
02:33:13,520 --> 02:33:14,353
I've noticed like synchronicities start 
happening more like good luck starts 

3222
02:33:17,481 --> 02:33:18,314
happening.
More like interesting things start 

3223
02:33:20,121 --> 02:33:20,680
happening.

3224
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:21,700
Yeah,
I think you,

3225
02:33:21,701 --> 02:33:22,534
we,
we,

3226
02:33:22,750 --> 02:33:27,280
we fight against ourselves sometimes 
accidentally liked me when I was young.

3227
02:33:27,610 --> 02:33:28,443
When I was young I would have an 
interaction with someone and then I 

3228
02:33:30,401 --> 02:33:31,234
would always imagine what they were 
going to say when we talked again and 

3229
02:33:34,331 --> 02:33:35,164
then I would imagine me talking shit to 
them and that I would imagine then 

3230
02:33:38,771 --> 02:33:41,920
getting upset at me and having a 
delusional perspective.

3231
02:33:41,921 --> 02:33:45,460
I would like play out this weird play in
my mind.

3232
02:33:45,461 --> 02:33:46,294
I'm on.
And then when I was in my twenties I 

3233
02:33:48,041 --> 02:33:49,990
started to realize how preposterous it 
was.

3234
02:33:50,020 --> 02:33:50,853
Took me that long and I realized like 
I'm wasting all this time and I didn't 

3235
02:33:55,181 --> 02:33:57,360
realize it was crazy.
I didn't realize other people did.

3236
02:33:57,510 --> 02:34:00,280
I talked to my friend Brian once and he 
was saying the same thing.

3237
02:34:00,340 --> 02:34:01,173
I go,
you have arguments with people that 

3238
02:34:01,931 --> 02:34:03,280
aren't there.
It goes all the fucking time,

3239
02:34:03,730 --> 02:34:04,563
all the fucking time.
I have arguments in my head with people 

3240
02:34:06,071 --> 02:34:06,904
that were there that's like sometimes 
you'll have a conversation with someone 

3241
02:34:08,501 --> 02:34:09,334
about something and then you both 
immediately are like relieved and start 

3242
02:34:11,861 --> 02:34:12,694
laughing because you were both expecting
the other person to be like Super Mad 

3243
02:34:15,791 --> 02:34:17,980
and come in like an asshole,
but meanwhile you're both

3244
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:22,090
apologize and then it just goes away and
then everybody feels way better.

3245
02:34:22,091 --> 02:34:25,180
A better way.
Better like conflict is stupid.

3246
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:30,300
What's not stupid is exercising out all 
the anxiety that your body possesses,

3247
02:34:31,151 --> 02:34:33,580
that it creates conflict in the first 
place.

3248
02:34:33,730 --> 02:34:34,563
Whether it's exercising it through 
meditation or through taking a yoga 

3249
02:34:37,511 --> 02:34:38,344
class or doing something physical.
That just gives you some relief of 

3250
02:34:41,261 --> 02:34:44,200
stress because you exert yourself.
It doesn't have to be anything crazy.

3251
02:34:44,201 --> 02:34:46,900
Fucking going on a nice hike.
You go on a nice hike,

3252
02:34:46,901 --> 02:34:50,080
you get to see things and you feel 
better like you're walking.

3253
02:34:50,081 --> 02:34:52,120
The blood starts pumping through your 
brain.

3254
02:34:52,390 --> 02:34:54,370
You come up with great ideas when you 
hike,

3255
02:34:54,670 --> 02:34:55,503
you know,
it's like all these things are just 

3256
02:34:56,530 --> 02:34:57,363
little incremental steps at every one of
us can take and you do that and it 

3257
02:35:00,521 --> 02:35:02,440
changes everything.
Then you be nicer,

3258
02:35:02,470 --> 02:35:03,970
nicer to people.
That changes everything too.

3259
02:35:04,330 --> 02:35:08,350
And it helps you to be nicer if you have
control of your physical body.

3260
02:35:08,410 --> 02:35:09,720
That's it.
And,

3261
02:35:09,730 --> 02:35:10,563
and the,
you know,

3262
02:35:10,570 --> 02:35:12,130
the question that we're talking about 
earlier,

3263
02:35:12,131 --> 02:35:12,964
it's like,
what the fuck do we do about the 

3264
02:35:13,541 --> 02:35:15,970
lunatics out there?
Well,

3265
02:35:15,971 --> 02:35:16,781
what you do,
man,

3266
02:35:16,781 --> 02:35:17,650
you,
I mean,

3267
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:18,753
if you can,
you start with a fucking lunatic that 

3268
02:35:21,431 --> 02:35:26,431
you're sitting in right now.
That's what you do.

3269
02:35:27,750 --> 02:35:28,940
Absolutely.
Lunatic.

3270
02:35:30,030 --> 02:35:30,970
And then,
and then,

3271
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:31,661
and,
and,

3272
02:35:31,661 --> 02:35:32,351
and,
and that,

3273
02:35:32,351 --> 02:35:32,890
I mean,
that's,

3274
02:35:32,890 --> 02:35:35,580
that's exactly what Rom da says is,
uh,

3275
02:35:35,830 --> 02:35:38,560
we work on ourselves so we can help the 
people next to us.

3276
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:41,530
And that's all you can do because you 
can't do shit,

3277
02:35:41,531 --> 02:35:43,150
man,
to make another person.

3278
02:35:43,390 --> 02:35:46,510
You're not really gonna do much to the 
other people around you.

3279
02:35:46,720 --> 02:35:48,550
They're going to do their own thing.
They're going to decide.

3280
02:35:48,910 --> 02:35:49,743
I mean,
this is something I've been thinking 

3281
02:35:51,790 --> 02:35:52,623
fucking Jesus,
because a lot of people talk about 

3282
02:35:54,941 --> 02:35:55,774
miracles and stuff,
especially like in the camps I hang out 

3283
02:35:58,120 --> 02:35:59,650
with.
Like Duncan says,

3284
02:35:59,830 --> 02:36:01,960
I've been thinking about fucking Jesus.

3285
02:36:04,510 --> 02:36:05,350
No,
I will.

3286
02:36:05,710 --> 02:36:08,170
That's freaking.
That's a different thing.

3287
02:36:08,171 --> 02:36:10,620
Fucking fucking Jesus.
Yeah,

3288
02:36:10,720 --> 02:36:11,553
I would totally do it.
It's a different thing that you've 

3289
02:36:12,971 --> 02:36:14,890
already done it.
If you do DMT,

3290
02:36:15,170 --> 02:36:16,570
I,
but that's part of the experience.

3291
02:36:16,571 --> 02:36:19,150
Making Christ,
having intercourse with the Christ.

3292
02:36:19,480 --> 02:36:21,910
It would be an honor through all pours.
It would be an honor.

3293
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:25,720
You go together like you just merge.
You just merged.

3294
02:36:25,721 --> 02:36:26,554
You just merge.
You're on your knees again at the video 

3295
02:36:28,571 --> 02:36:29,410
store.
This guy,

3296
02:36:29,411 --> 02:36:31,780
it's always dirty with him,
but she never be just psychedelic,

3297
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:37,430
psychedelic love about Jesus.
Just be on your knees choking on Christ.

3298
02:36:37,440 --> 02:36:38,273
Come or not,
but I can guarantee you can guarantee 

3299
02:36:43,060 --> 02:36:45,500
that's going to be a semi.
A sex simulator for sure.

3300
02:36:45,620 --> 02:36:47,420
My to Christ there.
Sure,

3301
02:36:48,070 --> 02:36:50,290
sure.
Of the Virgin Mary.

3302
02:36:50,740 --> 02:36:52,000
She was hot.
These people,

3303
02:36:52,001 --> 02:36:54,790
they talk about mirrors.
Nice guys.

3304
02:36:54,791 --> 02:36:55,624
Come on.
I'm trying to talk about fucking 

3305
02:36:56,620 --> 02:36:57,490
miracles here.

3306
02:36:57,850 --> 02:36:58,683
So I know these people,
they talk about miracles that bunch and 

3307
02:37:08,621 --> 02:37:09,341
like,
you know,

3308
02:37:09,341 --> 02:37:13,210
having seen some of these fucking gurus 
do crazy shit,

3309
02:37:13,510 --> 02:37:14,343
but they always say it doesn't matter.
Like ultimately these are dishes like 

3310
02:37:18,081 --> 02:37:19,220
fireworks,
kind of.

3311
02:37:19,221 --> 02:37:20,720
It's just like tricks.
It's a firework.

3312
02:37:20,721 --> 02:37:21,554
It doesn't because like the thing is 
like you could sit in front of someone 

3313
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:27,620
and like levitate bottles in front of 
him,

3314
02:37:27,950 --> 02:37:31,100
like levitate a bunch of bottles,
teleport across the room,

3315
02:37:31,130 --> 02:37:33,710
come back and then tell the person,
you know,

3316
02:37:33,711 --> 02:37:35,780
you're going to be a lot happier if you 
go jogging.

3317
02:37:36,260 --> 02:37:39,050
Like someone could do that to me and 
tomorrow I'm gonna wake up.

3318
02:37:39,500 --> 02:37:40,101
And I was like,
yeah,

3319
02:37:40,101 --> 02:37:43,100
he levitated bottles.
He poured across the room.

3320
02:37:43,101 --> 02:37:46,870
They told me I should go jogging,
I'll probably go tomorrow.

3321
02:37:47,410 --> 02:37:49,350
No fucking jogging.
I don't care.

3322
02:37:49,590 --> 02:37:52,990
They don't care the liver.
So the,

3323
02:37:54,890 --> 02:37:56,120
you know what I mean?
It doesn't matter.

3324
02:37:56,480 --> 02:37:58,810
None of it.
None of the point is like if.

3325
02:37:58,820 --> 02:38:01,810
So if a person who can levitate bottles 
probably isn't gonna,

3326
02:38:01,830 --> 02:38:02,663
make you go jogging,
then certainly you're not going to be 

3327
02:38:05,211 --> 02:38:07,190
able to talk to a person and be like,
hey,

3328
02:38:07,191 --> 02:38:09,080
you know you're going to feel better if 
you do this,

3329
02:38:09,530 --> 02:38:13,010
you all you can really do is look at 
yourself and be like,

3330
02:38:13,011 --> 02:38:15,410
you know what,
I'm gonna go fucking jogging.

3331
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:16,800
This is a really good point.
What is,

3332
02:38:16,830 --> 02:38:20,580
what's your take on this in terms of 
like the miracles in the Bible?

3333
02:38:20,581 --> 02:38:23,280
Like some of the weirder ones like 
walking on water,

3334
02:38:23,580 --> 02:38:25,980
like what do you do?
What do you think that's about?

3335
02:38:25,981 --> 02:38:26,814
What do you think like the.
Even though the interpretation of those 

3336
02:38:29,011 --> 02:38:30,120
is kind of suspect,
right?

3337
02:38:30,121 --> 02:38:33,660
Like what isn't the walking on water is 
a weird one because I think it has to do

3338
02:38:33,661 --> 02:38:34,494
with translation and I think that it 
could be interpreted in other languages 

3339
02:38:38,821 --> 02:38:39,654
walking by the water,
like walking near the water could be 

3340
02:38:42,961 --> 02:38:45,990
thought of as levitating and walking on 
water polo and the preposition.

3341
02:38:45,991 --> 02:38:46,561
Man.
Yeah.

3342
02:38:46,561 --> 02:38:47,394
It's so hard when you're going from 
ancient Hebrew and Aramaic and all this 

3343
02:38:50,551 --> 02:38:52,470
different shit.
But do you think that this,

3344
02:38:52,680 --> 02:38:56,970
what you're saying is that someone would
do tricks to get you to listen to them,

3345
02:38:57,390 --> 02:39:02,230
like you levitate things or walk on 
water or turn water into wine minds?

3346
02:39:02,700 --> 02:39:05,640
Moses splits the sea.
Like what?

3347
02:39:06,180 --> 02:39:06,980
Like,
you know,

3348
02:39:06,980 --> 02:39:09,120
I used to have a bit about that where it
was like,

3349
02:39:09,121 --> 02:39:11,730
um,
like there'd be like 100 people standing

3350
02:39:11,731 --> 02:39:13,710
behind him going,
how long can you hold that?

3351
02:39:14,490 --> 02:39:16,110
Like,
what the fuck is he doing?

3352
02:39:16,350 --> 02:39:17,320
Like why do you split the,
Oh,

3353
02:39:17,321 --> 02:39:19,930
we have to walk across that because 
that's going to take dates.

3354
02:39:21,030 --> 02:39:22,470
I'm like,
how's he doing that magic.

3355
02:39:22,770 --> 02:39:25,980
Tell that silly motherfucker uses magic 
and make us a boat.

3356
02:39:26,530 --> 02:39:31,530
It's crazy walking a mile high of on one
side or the other.

3357
02:39:32,370 --> 02:39:33,203
You just walking through the middle.
Just fucking dead fish flopping around 

3358
02:39:35,641 --> 02:39:38,280
in the middle walls of water on either 
side.

3359
02:39:38,320 --> 02:39:39,400
Yeah.
Very humid.

3360
02:39:39,660 --> 02:39:40,840
Yeah.
Fuck that.

3361
02:39:40,870 --> 02:39:41,703
Well,
I mean you're,

3362
02:39:41,710 --> 02:39:42,543
that's all,
you know,

3363
02:39:42,550 --> 02:39:46,060
that's literal interpretations.
It's something that's way deeper than.

3364
02:39:46,061 --> 02:39:48,740
That adds a lot of deeper meanings.
It's probably a,

3365
02:39:48,810 --> 02:39:49,643
you know,
it's a,

3366
02:39:49,830 --> 02:39:50,663
it's a myth.
They're using these encoded stories to 

3367
02:39:53,231 --> 02:39:54,064
try to get across something that's a lot
bigger and it's isn't about really 

3368
02:39:58,751 --> 02:40:00,170
walking on water maybe.
No,

3369
02:40:00,171 --> 02:40:00,220
no,

3370
02:40:00,220 --> 02:40:01,053
but I think that these showing that the 
people that had all this knowledge also 

3371
02:40:04,841 --> 02:40:05,674
had magic tricks is very telling.
Like the people that everybody would 

3372
02:40:09,611 --> 02:40:10,400
follow.
They were.

3373
02:40:10,400 --> 02:40:13,200
They were able to do things right.
Like,

3374
02:40:13,230 --> 02:40:17,760
well,
how about the guy who I'm called upon a.

3375
02:40:17,800 --> 02:40:22,500
She bear to kill these kids that were 
mocking him for being bald.

3376
02:40:23,070 --> 02:40:25,100
That's a story that's in the Bible.
Yeah,

3377
02:40:25,110 --> 02:40:25,561
yeah,
yeah.

3378
02:40:25,561 --> 02:40:27,540
There was a man,
I forget his name.

3379
02:40:27,970 --> 02:40:30,990
You can find that story.
He called a upon a.

3380
02:40:30,991 --> 02:40:31,824
She bear and God brought down a sheet 
bear to smite these children that were 

3381
02:40:36,031 --> 02:40:37,410
making fun of is balding.

3382
02:40:39,480 --> 02:40:41,040
She asked,
well,

3383
02:40:41,041 --> 02:40:43,020
I think it was a female bear.
They would.

3384
02:40:43,080 --> 02:40:46,350
They would do cold.
She bare back then to today,

3385
02:40:46,390 --> 02:40:49,380
they were,
I guess we'd call it a sow sow bear,

3386
02:40:49,570 --> 02:40:50,403
but that this bear killed the kids 
because they were making fun of him for 

3387
02:40:52,711 --> 02:40:53,820
being,
for being bald.

3388
02:40:54,330 --> 02:40:55,650
Like what?
Like,

3389
02:40:55,850 --> 02:40:56,970
you know,
there again,

3390
02:40:56,971 --> 02:40:57,804
you have to listen to this guy.
He's got magic is able to conjure up 

3391
02:41:01,890 --> 02:41:04,260
from the forest to kill mocking 
children.

3392
02:41:04,290 --> 02:41:05,790
Yeah.
They walk on water.

3393
02:41:05,791 --> 02:41:06,624
They turned water into wine here.
Why did God killed 42 lads merely for 

3394
02:41:10,321 --> 02:41:11,610
saying Alicia was bald?

3395
02:41:13,510 --> 02:41:15,920
Forty two lads.
That makes it worse.

3396
02:41:17,990 --> 02:41:19,990
Friendly.
Or let's read the verse.

3397
02:41:20,020 --> 02:41:21,610
Then he went up from there to backfill.
Anyways,

3398
02:41:21,700 --> 02:41:23,050
going up,
by the way,

3399
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:26,200
young lads came out from the city and 
mocked him and said,

3400
02:41:26,230 --> 02:41:27,640
damn,
go app your bald.

3401
02:41:27,641 --> 02:41:29,730
Head Up.
You bought it.

3402
02:41:30,220 --> 02:41:34,150
When he looked behind him and saw them,
he cursed them in the name of the Lord.

3403
02:41:34,151 --> 02:41:36,250
It doesn't say what he says in all caps 
too,

3404
02:41:36,251 --> 02:41:38,070
by the way,
like it's fucking twitter account.

3405
02:41:38,290 --> 02:41:40,180
Tooth then to feet.
Yeah,

3406
02:41:40,181 --> 02:41:42,220
Lord.
God.

3407
02:41:42,250 --> 02:41:43,083
Then to female bears,
came out of the woods and tore up 42 

3408
02:41:47,201 --> 02:41:51,080
lads have their number.
I thought it was too too.

3409
02:41:51,400 --> 02:41:56,400
That's crazy.
It knows to bears either one.

3410
02:41:56,861 --> 02:41:58,410
She bear weight.
What is this?

3411
02:41:58,430 --> 02:42:02,560
So this is like actually exploring this.
Why would God allow two bears to kill 42

3412
02:42:02,561 --> 02:42:03,394
young black,
and it's written by a guy named Matt 

3413
02:42:06,210 --> 02:42:07,043
Slick,

3414
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:10,170
probably doing porn right now,
red liquid.

3415
02:42:10,171 --> 02:42:11,880
It says,
let's take a look.

3416
02:42:11,910 --> 02:42:13,520
Bitch.
You ain't taking nothing.

3417
02:42:13,560 --> 02:42:14,393
You're just guessing.
Alicia was traveling from Jericho to 

3418
02:42:16,921 --> 02:42:19,530
Bethel when a group of young men 
verbally accosted him.

3419
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:23,220
A 42 is a large number of people and 
they were probably an organized group,

3420
02:42:23,350 --> 02:42:24,183
gone out to challenge the La show.
Their mockery implied a militia to a 

3421
02:42:27,980 --> 02:42:28,813
malicious intent,
especially when the culture of the time 

3422
02:42:30,840 --> 02:42:32,940
insisted on showing respect to their 
elders.

3423
02:42:33,060 --> 02:42:35,070
Furthermore,
the statement go up.

3424
02:42:35,071 --> 02:42:38,700
You bald head has cultural significance.
First of all,

3425
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:39,593
go up in parenthesis is a probably a 
reference to a licensed predecessor 

3426
02:42:44,730 --> 02:42:47,700
Alijah ascending to heaven.
In other words,

3427
02:42:47,870 --> 02:42:50,340
they are stating that when Elijah got,
oh,

3428
02:42:50,341 --> 02:42:51,540
they want to lie Shangaan,
it's,

3429
02:42:51,610 --> 02:42:54,750
oh,
this is just so ridiculously intense.

3430
02:42:54,780 --> 02:42:55,613
Elijah had gone on to the next world.
The implication is they wanted 

3431
02:42:58,510 --> 02:43:00,450
[inaudible] dead.
Also,

3432
02:43:00,451 --> 02:43:01,284
the epitaph,
bald head was one of contempt in the 

3433
02:43:03,691 --> 02:43:08,040
east end.
Quotes apply to a person who,

3434
02:43:08,100 --> 02:43:08,933
a person,
even with a bushy head of hair lepers 

3435
02:43:11,711 --> 02:43:12,280
had to shave

3436
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:13,540
their heads,
is such a statement,

3437
02:43:13,541 --> 02:43:16,030
could easily have been deliberate,
malicious insult,

3438
02:43:16,031 --> 02:43:17,110
something dangerous.
And um,

3439
02:43:17,770 --> 02:43:18,603
yeah,
so it's such a weird interpretation of 

3440
02:43:21,161 --> 02:43:24,430
what it is.
Either way you sent bears to kill people

3441
02:43:24,431 --> 02:43:25,264
for marketing your fucking head because 
you're saying it's okay if they were 

3442
02:43:28,181 --> 02:43:31,690
being disrespectful,
that God would just call some bears.

3443
02:43:31,770 --> 02:43:35,010
That this is the weirdest sort of a 
justification for attack by,

3444
02:43:35,290 --> 02:43:36,123
by wild beasts.
The creator of the universe is using a 

3445
02:43:39,461 --> 02:43:42,190
wild beast to attack because someone 
hurt with words.

3446
02:43:42,530 --> 02:43:45,970
Have you read the book of Job?
Nothing since I was like,

3447
02:43:45,971 --> 02:43:47,530
it's so.
It's a whopper men.

3448
02:43:47,560 --> 02:43:50,860
So it's the story of this Guy Joe,
who's like prosperous.

3449
02:43:50,861 --> 02:43:52,330
He's in love,
he's married,

3450
02:43:52,331 --> 02:43:53,164
he has three children and lots of 
animals and land and everything's going 

3451
02:43:56,231 --> 02:43:57,064
great.
And so up in heaven or in wherever they 

3452
02:43:59,471 --> 02:44:00,304
are,
God and the devil are having a 

3453
02:44:02,261 --> 02:44:06,520
conversation and God is saying,
look at how great I am,

3454
02:44:06,521 --> 02:44:07,750
how everyone loves me.

3455
02:44:07,750 --> 02:44:08,780
And you know,
look at Joe.

3456
02:44:08,781 --> 02:44:11,170
He loves me.
He worships all the time and all that,

3457
02:44:11,171 --> 02:44:12,004
and the devil says,
of course he does because his life so 

3458
02:44:13,841 --> 02:44:18,040
good take away is a sheep and see what 
he says.

3459
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:20,680
And God's like,
alright,

3460
02:44:20,740 --> 02:44:21,573
so he kills all job.
Sheep and job goes to church and 

3461
02:44:23,981 --> 02:44:26,380
worships and no problem.
And then the devil's lake.

3462
02:44:26,410 --> 02:44:27,243
Yeah,
but if you took away the cows and the 

3463
02:44:29,021 --> 02:44:30,520
land there,
then you'd see.

3464
02:44:30,910 --> 02:44:31,743
So God goes,
it takes away the cows and the land and 

3465
02:44:33,251 --> 02:44:37,570
it goes on and on until job is totally 
destitute.

3466
02:44:37,660 --> 02:44:42,660
All of his family is dead.
He sitting on an ash heap with boils all

3467
02:44:42,671 --> 02:44:45,760
over his body.
That's how far God was willing to go,

3468
02:44:45,761 --> 02:44:49,420
to prove a point to the devil.
Jesus Christ.

3469
02:44:49,510 --> 02:44:50,850
Remember that part?
Didn't.

3470
02:44:50,860 --> 02:44:55,860
He continued to love God.
That's a crazy story.

3471
02:44:57,460 --> 02:44:58,550
Sorry,
let me just finish.

3472
02:44:58,650 --> 02:45:01,600
So then what?
So then God wins the bet.

3473
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:02,913
Whereas tortured this dude and he gives 
back twice as much as everything to job 

3474
02:45:08,740 --> 02:45:09,573
to reward him.
So now he has 400 sheep and one in six 

3475
02:45:13,841 --> 02:45:15,710
children.
And it's like.

3476
02:45:15,850 --> 02:45:18,610
So it didn't matter who those children 
were that you killed.

3477
02:45:18,790 --> 02:45:20,860
And the wife,
you just give them another wife and more

3478
02:45:20,861 --> 02:45:21,790
children.
You're better.

3479
02:45:22,290 --> 02:45:24,730
Maybe had a little time machine spun it 
all back.

3480
02:45:24,760 --> 02:45:28,160
I mean he did create the universe.
He could do whatever the fuck you want.

3481
02:45:28,180 --> 02:45:30,250
That is kind of like the part in job.
That's.

3482
02:45:30,370 --> 02:45:31,540
I mean again,
literally.

3483
02:45:31,541 --> 02:45:33,460
Yeah,
it's fucking ridiculous.

3484
02:45:33,461 --> 02:45:34,294
But it's not supposed to be stories that
are meant to like encompass the human 

3485
02:45:38,621 --> 02:45:41,440
predicament and like one of the cool 
things in there isn't there?

3486
02:45:41,441 --> 02:45:42,274
This great line where job is like 
questioning why he would job is 

3487
02:45:45,521 --> 02:45:47,310
questioning him too or something.
He said something.

3488
02:45:47,410 --> 02:45:48,071
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

3489
02:45:48,071 --> 02:45:49,340
He,
they get into an argument.

3490
02:45:49,700 --> 02:45:51,780
Response is something like I created.
Yeah.

3491
02:45:51,790 --> 02:45:54,250
Where were you when I created the 
heavens and the earth?

3492
02:45:56,040 --> 02:45:58,930
And this is again man,
the fucking tone.

3493
02:45:59,440 --> 02:46:00,273
And at this debt,
this tribal desert religion is really 

3494
02:46:03,641 --> 02:46:06,850
harsh and patriarchal.
But the message behind it,

3495
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:09,740
it's pretty similar.
The bhagavad Gita,

3496
02:46:09,741 --> 02:46:10,000
which is

3497
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:10,833
just a fucking battlefield where Krishna
turns into that universal form is the 

3498
02:46:16,941 --> 02:46:19,930
quote ob Oppenheimer's quote,
behold,

3499
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:23,600
I have become damn become the destroyer 
of worlds.

3500
02:46:23,720 --> 02:46:25,760
And so it's a similar thing.
Both of these are saying,

3501
02:46:25,820 --> 02:46:29,180
listen,
tiny little human thing all caught up in

3502
02:46:29,181 --> 02:46:32,720
your life,
so fixated on everything about you.

3503
02:46:33,170 --> 02:46:36,980
You exist within the infinite span of 
time.

3504
02:46:37,370 --> 02:46:38,203
A Big Bang to go with something like we 
were saying longer than 13 point 7 

3505
02:46:42,380 --> 02:46:43,580
billion years.
You tiny,

3506
02:46:43,581 --> 02:46:44,414
tiny little thing.
You exist in something so infinitely 

3507
02:46:48,111 --> 02:46:51,980
gigantic and beautiful.
What do you think you control?

3508
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:55,640
What do you think you really control?
You don't control shit.

3509
02:46:55,850 --> 02:46:59,660
You don't control anything,
so that's what they really.

3510
02:46:59,661 --> 02:47:00,494
It's more of like when when we 
experienced inevitable catastrophe in 

3511
02:47:03,111 --> 02:47:05,930
our lives and we're looking around and 
like,

3512
02:47:05,931 --> 02:47:07,130
what the fuck,
man,

3513
02:47:07,460 --> 02:47:08,293
what the fuck's wrong with the universe?
It's like nothing's wrong with the 

3514
02:47:11,361 --> 02:47:13,400
universe.
Nothing's wrong with you.

3515
02:47:14,030 --> 02:47:15,320
Nothing's wrong with anything.
In fact,

3516
02:47:15,321 --> 02:47:17,570
everything's perfect.
Just surrender to it.

3517
02:47:17,810 --> 02:47:21,620
Even if you're sitting in the goddamn 
ash pile covered in boils,

3518
02:47:21,950 --> 02:47:25,790
if you just let go and surrender and 
drop the bitterness,

3519
02:47:26,120 --> 02:47:28,160
then you can.
If nothing else,

3520
02:47:28,161 --> 02:47:32,210
not suffer under the terrible weight of 
the resistance or feeling like a victim.

3521
02:47:32,630 --> 02:47:34,130
That's,
to me what I get at a job,

3522
02:47:34,131 --> 02:47:35,890
you know,
from the non literal level,

3523
02:47:35,910 --> 02:47:38,780
the literal level.
It's like God's hanging out with Satan,

3524
02:47:39,230 --> 02:47:40,590
so they played poker and shit.

3525
02:47:40,640 --> 02:47:41,473
What does that mean?
Like he just drops by like Satan 

3526
02:47:45,471 --> 02:47:48,970
sometimes just pops by wherever God 
lives and they make bets.

3527
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:50,690
They make beds.
It's ridiculous,

3528
02:47:50,810 --> 02:47:54,860
but it will suffer for God's bet like 
fear factor when you think about it.

3529
02:47:54,861 --> 02:47:56,160
No,
you got paid for Fairfax.

3530
02:47:57,520 --> 02:47:58,500
Perfect.
If you.

3531
02:47:58,510 --> 02:48:02,870
When you made $50,000
job,

3532
02:48:03,140 --> 02:48:03,973
the government takes a piece out of 
someone winning naked and afraid or any 

3533
02:48:06,651 --> 02:48:08,390
of those shows.
Government takes piece.

3534
02:48:08,420 --> 02:48:10,970
That's crazy.
You're out there choking on bug.

3535
02:48:10,990 --> 02:48:11,823
Dick's trying to make banana hammock out
of literal banana leaves for Dick by 

3536
02:48:19,340 --> 02:48:22,040
love or biting you everywhere.
It's so ridiculous.

3537
02:48:22,041 --> 02:48:24,350
Those shows are so ridiculous.
It's amazing.

3538
02:48:24,351 --> 02:48:26,250
They haven't killed anybody.
It is Kong.

3539
02:48:26,300 --> 02:48:29,180
How come nobody's gotten bitten by 
spiders and died or some shit?

3540
02:48:29,540 --> 02:48:32,180
Some people get super sick on the show.
Oh yeah.

3541
02:48:32,181 --> 02:48:34,850
Well they eat fucked up things.
By the way,

3542
02:48:34,910 --> 02:48:37,790
some of this stuff,
if you eat things and don't cook them,

3543
02:48:38,060 --> 02:48:40,010
those parasites can stay with you 
forever,

3544
02:48:40,610 --> 02:48:41,900
so I don't do Sushi.

3545
02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:47,800
Sushi is not bad if you get ocean Sushi,
but I've been told not to eat salmon.

3546
02:48:48,410 --> 02:48:49,550
I've been told,
yeah,

3547
02:48:49,551 --> 02:48:51,590
someone said that.
Freshwater Salmon.

3548
02:48:51,830 --> 02:48:54,580
The problem is salmon is a freshwater 
fish as well.

3549
02:48:54,730 --> 02:48:57,470
They go,
they migrate to go to the ocean and they

3550
02:48:57,500 --> 02:48:58,333
go and they're susceptible to some 
parasites apparently that a tuna and a 

3551
02:49:03,111 --> 02:49:07,530
lot of ocean born fish isn't susceptible
to because I guess the parents don't.

3552
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:10,950
They just live way easier and fresh 
water,

3553
02:49:11,070 --> 02:49:12,570
which makes sense,
right?

3554
02:49:13,760 --> 02:49:14,593
Yeah.
Also the salmon stop eating and their 

3555
02:49:17,311 --> 02:49:18,144
metabolism changes once they get back to
fresh water and so essentially they're 

3556
02:49:21,781 --> 02:49:23,700
dying from that point on,
you know,

3557
02:49:23,701 --> 02:49:26,610
so when you see them upstream there,
they're like zombies.

3558
02:49:26,611 --> 02:49:27,444
It's really gross.
Sushi is a really nutty thing when you 

3559
02:49:29,551 --> 02:49:30,820
stop and think about it,
right?

3560
02:49:30,900 --> 02:49:32,850
Because here we are,
we're,

3561
02:49:32,910 --> 02:49:36,930
we're like on these little landmasses 
surrounded by a blue.

3562
02:49:36,960 --> 02:49:37,793
Like as soon as you get to the edge,
you realize how much blue there and 

3563
02:49:39,280 --> 02:49:40,980
you're like,
Holy Shit,

3564
02:49:41,220 --> 02:49:42,710
that's all water.
Like,

3565
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:43,231
yeah,
yeah,

3566
02:49:43,231 --> 02:49:44,400
yeah.
We'll just so accustomed to it.

3567
02:49:44,401 --> 02:49:45,420
No big deal.
It's just water.

3568
02:49:45,580 --> 02:49:45,981
So.
No,

3569
02:49:45,981 --> 02:49:48,090
no,
it's this thing is mostly water.

3570
02:49:48,390 --> 02:49:50,910
We're on the dirt spots of this thing.
That's mostly water.

3571
02:49:51,060 --> 02:49:51,893
Yeah.
Well we do is we take these metal boxes 

3572
02:49:53,220 --> 02:49:56,850
and we float out there and we grab 
whatever is live and we scoop it up with

3573
02:49:56,851 --> 02:49:59,430
nets and fucking bring it in Bro.
It's great.

3574
02:49:59,640 --> 02:50:03,540
We serve it with a little bit of 
Jalapeno on top and some ponds do sauce.

3575
02:50:03,780 --> 02:50:04,613
You're gonna.
Love it and we're just extracting the 

3576
02:50:07,591 --> 02:50:10,410
fish out of the water ever.
Just pulling them out.

3577
02:50:10,411 --> 02:50:11,244
It's the only thing like it in terms of 
that fact that we're not dealing with 

3578
02:50:15,811 --> 02:50:19,260
farmed animals were scooping up wild 
animals.

3579
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:21,300
We don't allow that anymore in the 
United States,

3580
02:50:21,450 --> 02:50:22,283
like the United States,
you don't use the age to have market 

3581
02:50:23,521 --> 02:50:26,220
hunting for buffalo and for elk and for 
deer.

3582
02:50:26,221 --> 02:50:28,050
You're not allowed to do that anymore.
That's illegal.

3583
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:30,210
Now.
Wild game is wild,

3584
02:50:30,330 --> 02:50:32,490
but not wild fish,
wild fish.

3585
02:50:32,491 --> 02:50:33,324
You can commercially farm,
you could commercially cultivated and 

3586
02:50:37,291 --> 02:50:38,124
harvest you go out there with giant 
fucking nets and just scoop up wild 

3587
02:50:41,971 --> 02:50:42,804
creatures in the middle of the ocean 
because we don't have good regulations 

3588
02:50:45,271 --> 02:50:46,104
for the fucking ocean.
So 80 percent of what you bring up that 

3589
02:50:49,171 --> 02:50:50,340
you killed.
Oh yes.

3590
02:50:50,341 --> 02:50:53,850
Throw it over.
We're just draining that thing.

3591
02:50:53,940 --> 02:50:56,730
We're draining and it's wild.
It's a wild thing.

3592
02:50:57,030 --> 02:50:57,863
If like we,
if anybody tried to propose that today 

3593
02:50:59,701 --> 02:51:02,220
with like elk,
someone said,

3594
02:51:02,221 --> 02:51:05,340
we're just going to get nets and just 
run through the forest and gather up all

3595
02:51:05,341 --> 02:51:07,710
the elk and then we're going to sell it 
at the ELC store.

3596
02:51:07,890 --> 02:51:10,710
You'd be like the fuck you are right the
fuck you are,

3597
02:51:10,711 --> 02:51:11,544
man.
Those things are wild and kill all the 

3598
02:51:12,871 --> 02:51:17,690
Iraqi tunes and squirrels.
So you're decimating the environment and

3599
02:51:17,730 --> 02:51:18,563
monkeys,
they,

3600
02:51:18,680 --> 02:51:19,360
you know,
the,

3601
02:51:19,360 --> 02:51:23,670
the nets are super a work.
They work really hard,

3602
02:51:23,671 --> 02:51:25,050
you know what I mean?
Pulling through all that water.

3603
02:51:25,350 --> 02:51:27,330
Two or three trips,
they cut them loose.

3604
02:51:28,080 --> 02:51:30,150
They don't pull them back up to the boat
and recycle them.

3605
02:51:30,300 --> 02:51:33,690
They cut them loose.
So oceans are full of drifting nets,

3606
02:51:33,700 --> 02:51:34,533
miles wide,
just going on and killing more and more 

3607
02:51:38,041 --> 02:51:41,640
shit until they finally say no.
Yeah.

3608
02:51:41,700 --> 02:51:42,533
Because as you say,
it's this kind of wilderness now where 

3609
02:51:44,491 --> 02:51:49,491
it's unregulated largely and there's no 
way to look at it and see all that Shit,

3610
02:51:49,740 --> 02:51:51,540
you know?
Holy Shit.

3611
02:51:51,560 --> 02:51:53,580
Yeah.
It's really freaked me out.

3612
02:51:54,030 --> 02:51:54,863
Just thinking of the sheer numbers of 
nets drifting through the water and 

3613
02:51:57,481 --> 02:52:00,210
landing on the ground.
I know that because a friend of mine was

3614
02:52:00,211 --> 02:52:03,600
working with a guy who was,
if I remember this correctly,

3615
02:52:03,601 --> 02:52:05,620
it's in Chile,
I think kyle who's a,

3616
02:52:05,650 --> 02:52:06,483
he's a surfer,

3617
02:52:06,880 --> 02:52:09,370
goes around the world and does 
interesting research.

3618
02:52:10,090 --> 02:52:10,923
And uh,
he was in Chile and there was a guy 

3619
02:52:13,721 --> 02:52:14,554
starting a company that was created a 
market for those nets to encourage the 

3620
02:52:18,731 --> 02:52:21,310
fisherman to bring them back.
And then he recycled that,

3621
02:52:21,430 --> 02:52:22,263
that nylon,
because it's a pretty high quality 

3622
02:52:23,981 --> 02:52:25,860
nylon.
So the whole idea is he's,

3623
02:52:25,910 --> 02:52:30,400
he's created a sustainable business 
selling these things made from the nylon

3624
02:52:30,401 --> 02:52:33,190
that people know comes from the nylon.
Wow.

3625
02:52:33,191 --> 02:52:35,680
This is crazy.
Ghost fishing.

3626
02:52:36,610 --> 02:52:38,290
Yeah.
So they just go around.

3627
02:52:39,070 --> 02:52:41,320
Oh Man,
I had a talking about Sushi.

3628
02:52:41,321 --> 02:52:46,321
I had a really traumatic experience with
that in Alaska that have I told you,

3629
02:52:46,511 --> 02:52:47,980
you know,
so I,

3630
02:52:47,981 --> 02:52:48,814
I met this dude on the ferry going up.
Really Cool Guy Ed from Oregon 

3631
02:52:52,391 --> 02:52:54,820
somewhere.
He was camping next to me on the deck of

3632
02:52:54,821 --> 02:52:55,654
a,
the ferry boat and next to him was this 

3633
02:52:58,361 --> 02:52:59,194
really hot woman,
Becca and Becca never changed her 

3634
02:53:01,721 --> 02:53:04,030
clothes in like three or four days on 
the ferry.

3635
02:53:04,030 --> 02:53:06,400
Really sexy but never changed her 
clothes.

3636
02:53:06,401 --> 02:53:08,710
Never opened her backpack.
She had this huge backpack.

3637
02:53:09,060 --> 02:53:10,900
Finally it turned out it was full of 
weed.

3638
02:53:12,100 --> 02:53:15,200
She was smuggling from Hawaii to Alaska.
Yeah.

3639
02:53:15,400 --> 02:53:17,560
Wow.
So Ed sort of fell in love with her.

3640
02:53:17,561 --> 02:53:19,240
We get to this town and we get off.
I bet.

3641
02:53:19,270 --> 02:53:21,520
Ads like all into fishing.
Yeah,

3642
02:53:21,550 --> 02:53:23,460
exactly.
She's got it all bad.

3643
02:53:24,640 --> 02:53:27,700
So anyway,
he's super into fishing.

3644
02:53:27,701 --> 02:53:28,534
His dream,
his whole life has been to go to Alaska 

3645
02:53:30,070 --> 02:53:31,540
and fish.
Wow.

3646
02:53:31,570 --> 02:53:32,403
He's got this Super Nice Rod,
carbon rod and all this stuff and I 

3647
02:53:35,231 --> 02:53:38,650
don't know shit about fishing,
but we were in Petersburg,

3648
02:53:38,651 --> 02:53:41,410
Alaska and we go out.
I walk out with them.

3649
02:53:41,411 --> 02:53:42,640
I'm a vegetarian,
but anyway,

3650
02:53:42,641 --> 02:53:45,430
he casts first cast.
He catches the salmon,

3651
02:53:45,460 --> 02:53:46,293
big salmon,
brings it in and kills it with a rock 

3652
02:53:49,181 --> 02:53:50,230
and all that.
And then another.

3653
02:53:50,231 --> 02:53:51,160
He's super happy.

3654
02:53:51,160 --> 02:53:52,780
It's his dream.
Everything's wonderful.

3655
02:53:53,350 --> 02:53:58,330
We go back to this campsite where we are
and there's like a maybe 10 tents around

3656
02:53:58,331 --> 02:54:01,150
in this campground and it's central area
with a fire and all that.

3657
02:54:01,660 --> 02:54:05,530
And he so happy because he's going to 
feed everybody.

3658
02:54:05,540 --> 02:54:08,290
He's got these three fish,
he's feeling great and he's so he's got,

3659
02:54:08,460 --> 02:54:09,293
you know,
puts a onions and shit inside and the 

3660
02:54:10,590 --> 02:54:14,200
foil and all that.
And everybody's hanging out.

3661
02:54:14,201 --> 02:54:16,540
Everybody's super happy.
He passes out the fish,

3662
02:54:16,541 --> 02:54:19,990
he's got his own smaller one is for him.
Everyone else is sharing the other two.

3663
02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:21,393
And I'm sitting up behind him looking 
over his shoulder and I see movement in 

3664
02:54:26,681 --> 02:54:30,550
this fish and I'm like,
hi.

3665
02:54:30,551 --> 02:54:32,800
And we'd been drinking and it's 
firelight,

3666
02:54:32,860 --> 02:54:33,693
but I'm pretty sure I see movement and I
looked closer over shoulder and there's 

3667
02:54:38,650 --> 02:54:39,483
all these tiny little white worms at the
center of the fish that hadn't been 

3668
02:54:43,661 --> 02:54:45,360
cooked out.
And they're all just moving,

3669
02:54:45,361 --> 02:54:47,440
moving like Sylvia.
Right?

3670
02:54:47,650 --> 02:54:48,483
Oh my God.
How many of you had a bite already know 

3671
02:54:51,641 --> 02:54:53,050
I'm a vegetarian.
Oh,

3672
02:54:53,051 --> 02:54:54,070
that's right.
At that point,

3673
02:54:54,071 --> 02:54:55,570
right?
So I didn't need any.

3674
02:54:56,230 --> 02:54:59,320
And it's like the best night of his 
life.

3675
02:54:59,530 --> 02:55:01,150
Oh my God.
And I'm a.

3676
02:55:01,420 --> 02:55:03,010
I got tell him.
Yes,

3677
02:55:03,050 --> 02:55:03,980
right.
He's already eaten

3678
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:06,230
half the fish.
Oh Jesus.

3679
02:55:07,610 --> 02:55:09,550
Oh.
So I say,

3680
02:55:09,570 --> 02:55:11,030
ed man,
stop.

3681
02:55:11,070 --> 02:55:11,960
Look,
look at this.

3682
02:55:11,961 --> 02:55:14,180
And he sees it and he's just like,
oh fuck.

3683
02:55:14,181 --> 02:55:16,490
He goes from the top of the world to the
bottom,

3684
02:55:16,940 --> 02:55:21,470
grabs this bottle of Tequila drinks half
this bottle of Tequila it to try to kill

3685
02:55:21,471 --> 02:55:23,500
what's in his stomach work.
I don't know.

3686
02:55:23,820 --> 02:55:26,100
It's a great idea.
Probably would work guys.

3687
02:55:26,101 --> 02:55:26,934
Thank you.
It was just a good excuse to get fucked 

3688
02:55:28,191 --> 02:55:29,990
up and stub my toe.
Kimmy.

3689
02:55:29,991 --> 02:55:32,210
That Tequila quit.
Got fired.

3690
02:55:32,211 --> 02:55:33,950
Fuck you mean it.
Tequila quick.

3691
02:55:35,110 --> 02:55:36,960
Whatever happens.
Tequila.

3692
02:55:37,060 --> 02:55:39,320
I need half a bottle of Tequila on the 
devil.

3693
02:55:39,960 --> 02:55:43,670
Will Tequila means cure all in Spanish.
Oh man,

3694
02:55:45,780 --> 02:55:47,900
got me to.
Damn.

3695
02:55:48,380 --> 02:55:50,810
Yeah,
that's the worms are fucking scary shit,

3696
02:55:50,811 --> 02:55:52,040
man.
That guy that a ref.

3697
02:55:52,390 --> 02:55:53,223
The guy who escaped North Korea,
so they found enormous tapeworms in his 

3698
02:55:56,121 --> 02:55:56,954
body.

3699
02:55:57,560 --> 02:55:58,520
His body.
He was like,

3700
02:55:59,290 --> 02:56:02,660
I think they described it as a toy that 
had been broken,

3701
02:56:02,880 --> 02:56:05,300
like it was just broken like all over 
the place,

3702
02:56:05,301 --> 02:56:09,710
like legs are broken bones or broken.
His insides are filled with parasites.

3703
02:56:09,711 --> 02:56:12,140
You got nutrition or times or something.
Yeah.

3704
02:56:12,150 --> 02:56:14,630
Good shot four times here.
The whole thing is horrific,

3705
02:56:14,631 --> 02:56:15,950
man.
That poor fucking guy,

3706
02:56:15,951 --> 02:56:16,784
man.
That poor fucking guy for Dune is 

3707
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:19,993
falling apart.
He gets short shot four times and he 

3708
02:56:22,131 --> 02:56:23,260
keeps running.
Yeah.

3709
02:56:24,140 --> 02:56:26,250
That's how bad he wanted to get free,
I guess.

3710
02:56:26,270 --> 02:56:28,420
Yeah,
the videos and Naomi,

3711
02:56:28,790 --> 02:56:29,690
you seen it?
No,

3712
02:56:29,730 --> 02:56:31,160
it's amazing.
It's amazing.

3713
02:56:31,260 --> 02:56:32,093
It's just making this run for it and 
they jumped out the car and they're 

3714
02:56:33,471 --> 02:56:35,630
shooting at me like really close 
distance while he's running.

3715
02:56:36,040 --> 02:56:36,873
I mean,
I didn't realize that they were that 

3716
02:56:37,431 --> 02:56:39,650
close to them.
They were on the ground like 15,

3717
02:56:39,651 --> 02:56:41,960
20 feet away from him shooting at him as
he's running,

3718
02:56:42,300 --> 02:56:43,520
as he jumped out of his car.

3719
02:56:43,610 --> 02:56:44,540
You know,
it's crazy.

3720
02:56:44,541 --> 02:56:48,920
Is that video of that fucking dude from 
North Korea and the airport getting that

3721
02:56:49,190 --> 02:56:51,220
poison put on him?
No,

3722
02:56:51,440 --> 02:56:52,880
I haven't seen that.
Oh,

3723
02:56:52,881 --> 02:56:54,070
Kim Jong.
UN's brother?

3724
02:56:54,090 --> 02:56:56,090
Yeah.
Kim Jongens brothers video.

3725
02:56:56,100 --> 02:56:57,560
The assassination.
Watch it.

3726
02:56:57,561 --> 02:57:01,130
It's why me is on it.
It's pretty intense.

3727
02:57:01,330 --> 02:57:02,420
What was it,
seren?

3728
02:57:02,450 --> 02:57:04,610
Is that what they put on him?
I don't know what it was.

3729
02:57:04,611 --> 02:57:05,910
Some nerve gas.
They,

3730
02:57:05,970 --> 02:57:08,000
they trick someone to doing that for 
them.

3731
02:57:08,001 --> 02:57:09,050
Right.
It wasn't a story.

3732
02:57:09,060 --> 02:57:12,440
A defense of the people who did it.
They're saying they didn't know,

3733
02:57:12,441 --> 02:57:15,890
but apparently there was footage of them
practicing it.

3734
02:57:16,370 --> 02:57:17,480
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

3735
02:57:17,510 --> 02:57:20,360
That's him afterwards.
That's him after getting zapped.

3736
02:57:21,140 --> 02:57:23,580
But you can watch like a professional 
assassination.

3737
02:57:25,080 --> 02:57:25,913
Yeah.
Ready at the airport and apparently he 

3738
02:57:28,581 --> 02:57:32,090
had the antidote in his baggage.
Oh Jesus Christ.

3739
02:57:32,150 --> 02:57:35,960
This is the thing with the them having 
like Icbm Vieques,

3740
02:57:36,560 --> 02:57:40,190
vieques that 20 minutes after VX 
poisoning.

3741
02:57:41,650 --> 02:57:43,010
Just how nutty.
I mean this is.

3742
02:57:43,310 --> 02:57:44,143
This is some old school shit that they 
do in the Soviet Union to write a bunch 

3743
02:57:47,301 --> 02:57:49,820
of people over there have been killed 
with poisoned in London.

3744
02:57:49,821 --> 02:57:52,130
Actually the.
There they are

3745
02:57:55,790 --> 02:57:58,190
there right there.
Just vx gas.

3746
02:57:59,260 --> 02:58:00,093
Mr.
Like puts a chloroform rag over his 

3747
02:58:03,061 --> 02:58:03,894
face.
She just walks over and put the rag on 

3748
02:58:05,341 --> 02:58:08,640
his head and they're going to show 
another video where you watch just comes

3749
02:58:08,641 --> 02:58:11,060
up behind him.
Fluid is low.

3750
02:58:11,250 --> 02:58:15,090
That's all it takes to kill you.
That's fucking insane.

3751
02:58:15,450 --> 02:58:18,120
And he's saying someone just put 
something on my face.

3752
02:58:19,020 --> 02:58:20,760
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

3753
02:58:22,020 --> 02:58:23,880
That's insane.
Yeah,

3754
02:58:23,881 --> 02:58:27,600
it's not scary.
Can't see that coming.

3755
02:58:29,760 --> 02:58:33,420
So you stay in there and she just walks 
right up and jack.

3756
02:58:33,421 --> 02:58:37,080
So whoa.
She was fast too.

3757
02:58:37,800 --> 02:58:39,000
That's intense,
man.

3758
02:58:40,590 --> 02:58:41,423
That's intense.
So my buddy had got medivaced out of 

3759
02:58:43,741 --> 02:58:46,620
Petersburg with the worms in his 
stomach,

3760
02:58:47,100 --> 02:58:49,290
intestinal bleeding.
Jesus Christ.

3761
02:58:49,291 --> 02:58:51,000
They were trying to burrow the way out.
Yep.

3762
02:58:51,210 --> 02:58:52,043
Eat his bones on the inside.
This is your friend who drank that 

3763
02:58:54,540 --> 02:58:56,760
Tequila doesn't work to get rid of one.
Killed them all.

3764
02:58:56,760 --> 02:58:59,910
He went to the doctor the next day in 
town and the doctor was like,

3765
02:58:59,911 --> 02:59:01,320
yeah,
it's probably no big deal.

3766
02:59:01,321 --> 02:59:03,270
Whatever you'll be.
Fuck you doctor.

3767
02:59:03,360 --> 02:59:04,193
And then I left and traveled all around 
Alaska and then went back home and when 

3768
02:59:08,041 --> 02:59:08,874
I was home I got a letter from him that 
he had been medivaced out and had been 

3769
02:59:11,641 --> 02:59:13,950
in the hospital,
had four or five surgeries.

3770
02:59:14,340 --> 02:59:17,880
How many other people fucked up?
I don't know if he'd lived a fish.

3771
02:59:17,910 --> 02:59:20,760
You don't know if he lived.
How many other people got sick?

3772
02:59:21,090 --> 02:59:22,800
Just his story.
If you just trust him,

3773
02:59:22,801 --> 02:59:26,400
the other fish were fine.
Could you go and find out for the story

3774
02:59:27,480 --> 02:59:28,313
so we know how we should feel.
I don't like these open ended a fucking 

3775
02:59:33,320 --> 02:59:35,570
ed was.
He lived in the country for old men type

3776
02:59:35,580 --> 02:59:38,160
end.
They lived happily ever after too,

3777
02:59:38,810 --> 02:59:39,643
to tell you guys seen that video.
That cam girl who's like a worm shoots 

3778
02:59:43,661 --> 02:59:47,640
at her ass,
hope everyone seemed.

3779
02:59:54,970 --> 02:59:57,960
Oh my God,
we did.

3780
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:03,000
Jamie can know if it's on instagram.
I haven't seen it.

3781
03:00:05,130 --> 03:00:09,500
He squats down and it's like just the 
very tip of some kind of worm thing like

3782
03:00:09,501 --> 03:00:13,230
pops out of her ass and sex back.
Jamie seen this.

3783
03:00:13,760 --> 03:00:15,830
Maybe I dreamed it.
I'm pretty sure you might.

3784
03:00:15,840 --> 03:00:16,673
It might not.
How interesting is it that there's two 

3785
03:00:18,321 --> 03:00:20,840
completely different social media 
platforms that we all use?

3786
03:00:20,910 --> 03:00:24,810
Twitter and instagram and one of them 
allow straight up porn.

3787
03:00:25,890 --> 03:00:26,940
Which one?
Twitter.

3788
03:00:27,150 --> 03:00:27,983
Twitter,
a straight up porn on your feet and you 

3789
03:00:30,631 --> 03:00:34,890
see a chick just gagging on a fat dick 
taking one right in the ass right there,

3790
03:00:35,140 --> 03:00:36,660
right at your feet and you're like,
whoa.

3791
03:00:36,920 --> 03:00:38,670
Yeah.
I don't know.

3792
03:00:39,150 --> 03:00:41,640
What is that?
Instagram wanted to be show nipples,

3793
03:00:42,450 --> 03:00:43,283
drills,
blends,

3794
03:00:43,330 --> 03:00:44,121
blurted,
nipples out.

3795
03:00:44,121 --> 03:00:45,960
Yeah.
You got to put like little acorns is.

3796
03:00:45,961 --> 03:00:49,290
What it's really interesting is because 
my eyesight's going shitty anyway,

3797
03:00:49,440 --> 03:00:52,770
so if a girl is mildly billers or 
Nipples,

3798
03:00:53,190 --> 03:00:55,980
to me it looks the same.
So you're getting around

3799
03:00:56,380 --> 03:00:59,620
just getting around,
playing the system built in system.

3800
03:01:01,380 --> 03:01:02,141
No,
for real though,

3801
03:01:02,141 --> 03:01:02,974
how blurry does it happen?
This is the question like would you see 

3802
03:01:06,210 --> 03:01:07,780
like a picture of my Dick?
Right?

3803
03:01:07,781 --> 03:01:08,614
If you have a picture of you sitting 
there and you want it to go on 

3804
03:01:10,301 --> 03:01:12,370
Instagram,
you would that Hawaiian shirt on,

3805
03:01:12,371 --> 03:01:13,204
Chris with your hog hanging out and you 
want to take a picture of slightly 

3806
03:01:16,121 --> 03:01:16,954
pixelate your Dick.
He'll be like really clear where the 

3807
03:01:19,871 --> 03:01:21,550
head of it is,
where the balls are,

3808
03:01:21,551 --> 03:01:25,180
where the shaft is.
Even the color of your deck will be very

3809
03:01:25,181 --> 03:01:26,014
easy to start,
but it's not totally your deck because 

3810
03:01:28,541 --> 03:01:31,680
it's all pixely.
Oh there,

3811
03:01:31,720 --> 03:01:33,340
look.
Oh,

3812
03:01:33,400 --> 03:01:35,050
okay.
Show it from the beginning.

3813
03:01:35,600 --> 03:01:36,433
I look.
Watch a seems like a worm that's seems 

3814
03:01:42,581 --> 03:01:47,510
like she'd get parasites internally.
Pixelation thing is one of them.

3815
03:01:47,910 --> 03:01:49,420
Thanks for bringing that to our 
attention.

3816
03:01:50,620 --> 03:01:54,110
Not Be Real.
I mean that wasn't the highest quality.

3817
03:01:54,180 --> 03:01:55,013
That could have been like some CGI even 
more fucked up than CGI and worms and 

3818
03:01:59,951 --> 03:02:00,784
they cam girls assholes or.
But if it was where I'm coming out of 

3819
03:02:03,401 --> 03:02:04,234
her ass hole,
because you really suck it back in like 

3820
03:02:05,411 --> 03:02:06,790
that.
I mean it's an asshole.

3821
03:02:06,791 --> 03:02:09,640
It's not lips.
It's like it sucked itself back in.

3822
03:02:09,670 --> 03:02:10,503
Yeah.
But you don't have a lung connected to 

3823
03:02:11,531 --> 03:02:14,140
your asshole.
Like how much are you sucking?

3824
03:02:14,290 --> 03:02:17,430
How much power does she have to get that
Spaghetti back into her mouth?

3825
03:02:17,540 --> 03:02:20,410
The wiring itself pulled its head back 
in.

3826
03:02:20,411 --> 03:02:21,310
It was like,
whoa.

3827
03:02:21,311 --> 03:02:26,311
Another universe looking at me.

3828
03:02:30,880 --> 03:02:33,310
The camera.
Fuck this.

3829
03:02:34,750 --> 03:02:35,460
I know,
right?

3830
03:02:35,460 --> 03:02:37,930
She used to that steady.
90 six degrees.

3831
03:02:37,960 --> 03:02:39,130
Yeah.
It's cozy.

3832
03:02:39,490 --> 03:02:40,480
Wow.
How weird,

3833
03:02:40,481 --> 03:02:42,640
man.
That we can get those.

3834
03:02:42,641 --> 03:02:43,474
I had a dog once,
it had worms and when she would go to 

3835
03:02:45,011 --> 03:02:46,900
the bathroom,
that's how I found it.

3836
03:02:46,901 --> 03:02:47,734
I saw worms,
inner poop and I saw worms like around 

3837
03:02:49,721 --> 03:02:51,130
her butthole and I was like,
oh,

3838
03:02:51,190 --> 03:02:52,023
someone's got a problem.
And they do that as drag across the 

3839
03:02:54,401 --> 03:02:58,000
carpet will dogsled they eat everything,
man,

3840
03:02:58,200 --> 03:02:59,110
you know,
they'll eat anything.

3841
03:02:59,111 --> 03:03:02,210
They find a dead rat.
They find a dead rat.

3842
03:03:02,211 --> 03:03:03,044
They just start eating it and they'd get
all kinds of fucked up things inside 

3843
03:03:05,801 --> 03:03:06,850
their body.
Oh Shit,

3844
03:03:06,851 --> 03:03:08,500
man.
If you seen that documentary.

3845
03:03:08,530 --> 03:03:09,100
Wait,
he.

3846
03:03:09,100 --> 03:03:09,933
God dammit.
I can't believe I can't remember his 

3847
03:03:10,991 --> 03:03:11,824
name.
He's the guy who like only ate 

3848
03:03:12,731 --> 03:03:17,530
McDonald's for Morgan spurlock.
Have you seen Morgan spurlock's rats?

3849
03:03:17,530 --> 03:03:18,640
Yes.
Yes.

3850
03:03:18,880 --> 03:03:22,010
Oh my God.
When they.

3851
03:03:22,240 --> 03:03:25,840
When they dissect the rack and you see 
what's living in that thing.

3852
03:03:25,860 --> 03:03:27,640
I about that bought fly that was in its 
neck.

3853
03:03:28,060 --> 03:03:32,560
Literally like if you had a football 
grown out of your side of your neck.

3854
03:03:32,860 --> 03:03:35,470
That's how big this Bot fly larva was.
It's called red.

3855
03:03:35,471 --> 03:03:36,850
It's on Netflix.
It's called rats.

3856
03:03:36,870 --> 03:03:40,120
It is fucked up and it's so good.
So good.

3857
03:03:40,121 --> 03:03:40,931
It's so good,
man.

3858
03:03:40,931 --> 03:03:41,764
But it is so deeply disturbing.
The raw numbers that you get hit with 

3859
03:03:47,410 --> 03:03:48,243
you.
Like what?

3860
03:03:48,340 --> 03:03:49,570
Wait a minute.
Is that real?

3861
03:03:49,780 --> 03:03:50,613
Like when you,
when you hear there's as many rats in 

3862
03:03:52,661 --> 03:03:55,210
New York City as there are human beings 
and you just go,

3863
03:03:55,211 --> 03:03:55,691
wait,
wait,

3864
03:03:55,691 --> 03:03:56,500
wait,
wait,

3865
03:03:56,500 --> 03:03:58,070
wait a minute.
Really?

3866
03:03:58,160 --> 03:04:00,080
Yeah.
There's the whole.

3867
03:04:00,440 --> 03:04:03,530
That's from the butterfly larva.
They pulled out of that things body.

3868
03:04:05,150 --> 03:04:06,200
Jesus.
Yeah,

3869
03:04:06,201 --> 03:04:07,034
and they said that there were so many of
them that they tested that have like 

3870
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:10,513
terminal illnesses in them to just 
fucking everywhere to man and in New 

3871
03:04:15,200 --> 03:04:16,033
York they set this camera up while those
garbage bags were being put out and you 

3872
03:04:18,801 --> 03:04:19,634
see the ratchet darn out of the sewer 
and then they stuck cameras down to 

3873
03:04:22,670 --> 03:04:23,503
sewer hose to find them and they learn 
about poisonous and they'll piss on it 

3874
03:04:27,081 --> 03:04:28,880
to warrant or they'll send in,
didn't they?

3875
03:04:28,910 --> 03:04:33,170
Didn't he say they'll send in like like 
Beta rats to the poison?

3876
03:04:33,320 --> 03:04:35,480
Yeah,
the sending Beta rats and they get stuck

3877
03:04:35,481 --> 03:04:36,314
in traps and they get they poison and 
they'll sit back and they'll watch and 

3878
03:04:39,501 --> 03:04:41,450
you can observe them do this.
They literally,

3879
03:04:41,720 --> 03:04:43,520
yeah,
they literally send the dumber or routes

3880
03:04:43,521 --> 03:04:44,160
for their.

3881
03:04:44,160 --> 03:04:46,970
They're like all things we were talking 
about earlier,

3882
03:04:47,240 --> 03:04:49,250
they're like a super organism,
a rats.

3883
03:04:49,610 --> 03:04:52,430
Rats are all basically the same shape 
and size.

3884
03:04:52,520 --> 03:04:54,830
They vary a little bit bigger,
a little bit smaller,

3885
03:04:54,831 --> 03:04:55,664
but mostly the same thing.
Who Look exactly the same and they 

3886
03:04:57,501 --> 03:04:59,360
behave like the same.
They do,

3887
03:04:59,400 --> 03:05:01,850
they all do the same shit and they all 
move into these and they're.

3888
03:05:01,851 --> 03:05:02,684
They're happy to live with.
Nothing else wants to live like we'll 

3889
03:05:04,160 --> 03:05:04,993
take it,
we'll moving in and they move in and 

3890
03:05:06,710 --> 03:05:07,543
breed in a way that's unprecedented in 
terms of things that like mammals that 

3891
03:05:12,501 --> 03:05:15,920
live alongside humans,
there's not a goddamn thing like rats,

3892
03:05:16,220 --> 03:05:18,410
like no other animals figured out how to
do it.

3893
03:05:18,411 --> 03:05:19,244
Like Rats,
k like they can do it in a way where 

3894
03:05:20,901 --> 03:05:24,730
this as many of them as there was a bus.
Just imagine that there's smart.

3895
03:05:25,530 --> 03:05:29,530
His father must be a lot of cockroaches.
Probably,

3896
03:05:29,690 --> 03:05:32,290
I would guess more than there are rats,
right?

3897
03:05:32,410 --> 03:05:34,310
Sure.
Because they're so small.

3898
03:05:34,380 --> 03:05:35,213
Oh yeah,
but those tools are like particular 

3899
03:05:36,861 --> 03:05:37,694
things.
It's really interesting because people 

3900
03:05:39,320 --> 03:05:40,153
don't like to.
They always want to think that they 

3901
03:05:41,811 --> 03:05:43,490
never.
They never prejudge.

3902
03:05:44,180 --> 03:05:46,640
They're not prejudice,
but we certainly are.

3903
03:05:46,940 --> 03:05:50,420
When it comes to rats and bugs.
Butterflies are awesome.

3904
03:05:50,510 --> 03:05:52,280
Butterfly landed on you.
Everybody's psyched.

3905
03:05:52,320 --> 03:05:55,160
Roche walks in the room,
everybody freaks out.

3906
03:05:55,670 --> 03:05:57,330
Wants to fucking stop it,
get it.

3907
03:05:57,750 --> 03:05:59,840
Get it right.
Yeah.

3908
03:05:59,900 --> 03:06:01,730
Mosquito comes in.
Everybody's pissed.

3909
03:06:02,180 --> 03:06:03,560
Spider walks in,
AH,

3910
03:06:03,561 --> 03:06:05,780
some people freak out.
Some people want to help the spider.

3911
03:06:06,260 --> 03:06:06,861
Yeah,
man,

3912
03:06:06,861 --> 03:06:10,640
when you see any kind of rat rats are no
Bueno.

3913
03:06:10,700 --> 03:06:13,260
Like to the core.
You see that rat and you're like that.

3914
03:06:13,261 --> 03:06:16,990
And a squirrel.
Squirrels are cool.

3915
03:06:17,700 --> 03:06:22,700
Just rats with bushy tail per well.

3916
03:06:24,110 --> 03:06:26,360
They don't eat meat.
That's the thing about squirrels.

3917
03:06:26,361 --> 03:06:30,110
Squirrels were eating acorns and shit.
That is just a better animal,

3918
03:06:30,111 --> 03:06:30,944
but they do eat meat sometimes.
Here's the fucked up thing about 

3919
03:06:33,591 --> 03:06:35,290
animals,
especially if there's,

3920
03:06:35,350 --> 03:06:36,183
you know,
they're sick or they have some weird 

3921
03:06:36,831 --> 03:06:37,664
nutrition requirement.
There's a video of a squirrel eating a 

3922
03:06:39,801 --> 03:06:43,010
mouse and it's hard to watch.
Man.

3923
03:06:43,160 --> 03:06:43,993
The squirrel was holding onto this mouth
mouse with its hands and just chewing 

3924
03:06:47,810 --> 03:06:48,990
into it.
A fucking score.

3925
03:06:49,640 --> 03:06:50,540
And you're like,
Whoa,

3926
03:06:50,600 --> 03:06:52,970
really?
This is a real trusted you.

3927
03:06:53,690 --> 03:06:54,950
Yeah,
you're a fucking squirrel.

3928
03:06:55,560 --> 03:06:56,010
You're supposed to

3929
03:06:56,010 --> 03:06:58,320
be super cool.
I could feed you like you could.

3930
03:06:58,400 --> 03:07:00,070
Like there it is.
Look at it,

3931
03:07:03,400 --> 03:07:08,400
but you always think,
well you started it with the warm in the

3932
03:07:08,671 --> 03:07:10,870
ass,
but it's been downhill from there.

3933
03:07:10,871 --> 03:07:11,704
I'm excited to look at that.
It's insane because he doesn't have any 

3934
03:07:17,251 --> 03:07:20,160
problem eating that rap.
He's watching a movie.

3935
03:07:20,161 --> 03:07:25,161
It's like he's watching game of thrones,
like enjoying some quickies devouring.

3936
03:07:26,371 --> 03:07:31,371
It seems like it's like you holding onto
a ham cream cone.

3937
03:07:32,480 --> 03:07:33,930
Look at that because it's biting into 
it.

3938
03:07:36,990 --> 03:07:39,710
Delicious.
Looking at it.

3939
03:07:39,720 --> 03:07:41,340
It's almost gone.
Jesus.

3940
03:07:41,370 --> 03:07:42,720
No,
I dropped a big chunk.

3941
03:07:42,730 --> 03:07:43,381
Oh,
he dropped.

3942
03:07:43,381 --> 03:07:45,360
So looking at these giant chunks of 
guts.

3943
03:07:45,361 --> 03:07:47,760
It's consuming.
He was hungry.

3944
03:07:48,070 --> 03:07:49,350
This is amazing,
man.

3945
03:07:49,670 --> 03:07:50,503
It's too bad.
The only audience he's bearing what's 

3946
03:07:54,031 --> 03:07:57,480
left of it.
This is a ground squirrel.

3947
03:07:57,630 --> 03:08:01,110
This is a different kind of squirrel.
That might be why ground squirrels are a

3948
03:08:01,111 --> 03:08:02,340
totally different kind of squirrel.

3949
03:08:02,610 --> 03:08:04,710
Ground.
Squirrels are actually a real problem on

3950
03:08:04,711 --> 03:08:07,410
ranches because they make millions.
Yeah.

3951
03:08:07,740 --> 03:08:12,740
They estimate to honed ranch is 270,000
acres and someone there told me,

3952
03:08:14,410 --> 03:08:15,243
I didn't check this true,
but just listen if it is told me that 

3953
03:08:17,821 --> 03:08:18,654
the biomass of these ground squirrels is
bigger than anything else on the ranch 

3954
03:08:25,170 --> 03:08:26,003
because these tiny little things there 
so fucking many of them that all the 

3955
03:08:28,501 --> 03:08:30,930
deer,
all the bear or the mountain lions,

3956
03:08:30,931 --> 03:08:34,200
all the wild pigs,
all the cattle that roam around there,

3957
03:08:34,201 --> 03:08:35,730
all the elk,
everything,

3958
03:08:35,820 --> 03:08:37,020
every other bird,
ground,

3959
03:08:37,021 --> 03:08:38,190
nesting birds,
Turkeys,

3960
03:08:38,220 --> 03:08:39,053
everything.
The biomass of those fucking ground 

3961
03:08:41,101 --> 03:08:44,100
squirrels was greater than all of it.
He's like,

3962
03:08:44,101 --> 03:08:45,510
I just want you to think about that for 
a second.

3963
03:08:45,940 --> 03:08:46,820
I was like,
what?

3964
03:08:47,220 --> 03:08:48,600
He's like,
we got a real problem with these things.

3965
03:08:48,601 --> 03:08:49,560
He goes,
you can't kill them,

3966
03:08:49,830 --> 03:08:50,663
and they leave holes and then the cattle
step in those holes and break their 

3967
03:08:53,521 --> 03:08:54,150
ankles.

3968
03:08:54,150 --> 03:08:58,050
You can't kill him because they're just 
too wildly where you gotta find them,

3969
03:08:58,450 --> 03:09:02,390
sit out there with a pistol and you're 
going to shoot it like poison or is what

3970
03:09:02,400 --> 03:09:03,233
he said.
He said he shot one of them and when he 

3971
03:09:05,311 --> 03:09:06,144
shot it,
another one grabbed it and dragged it 

3972
03:09:07,921 --> 03:09:12,921
into the hole to eat it.
Dude.

3973
03:09:13,570 --> 03:09:14,780
Eating it.
Yeah.

3974
03:09:16,280 --> 03:09:21,280
Not find out if ground nesting squirrels
eat meat.

3975
03:09:23,140 --> 03:09:25,230
If ground nesting squirrels are 
omnivores,

3976
03:09:25,330 --> 03:09:26,163
I wonder if they have a just a totally 
different diet because the they have 

3977
03:09:28,691 --> 03:09:31,610
those gross tails to.
They have almost rat tails.

3978
03:09:31,660 --> 03:09:32,493
The gross little things.
You don't feel good or when you're 

3979
03:09:34,051 --> 03:09:36,120
around them.
That's why we need more snakes.

3980
03:09:36,570 --> 03:09:38,430
Yeah.
We don't need more snakes.

3981
03:09:38,490 --> 03:09:40,620
We don't need more snakes.
Snakes.

3982
03:09:40,680 --> 03:09:44,880
Snakes are one of the only things that 
all babies are afraid of.

3983
03:09:44,940 --> 03:09:45,773
Instinctively.
Show an infant the new image of a snake 

3984
03:09:50,161 --> 03:09:51,180
and they'll just freak.
Well,

3985
03:09:51,181 --> 03:09:52,370
that's [inaudible] in the garden of 
Eden.

3986
03:09:52,371 --> 03:09:54,220
The snake is what made eve eat

3987
03:09:54,220 --> 03:09:56,980
the tree of the knowledge of Jesus.
True.

3988
03:09:57,040 --> 03:09:58,270
He's right though.
That's true.

3989
03:09:58,271 --> 03:10:00,640
Snakes fault.
Eaves a good chick.

3990
03:10:00,940 --> 03:10:03,640
Most neotropic.
Ground squirrels are omnivorous.

3991
03:10:03,700 --> 03:10:04,630
Or you go.
There you go.

3992
03:10:04,750 --> 03:10:06,280
There you go.
So they're eating meat.

3993
03:10:07,330 --> 03:10:12,330
Ground oral sex.
Caterpillar's crooked mice and make each

3994
03:10:13,151 --> 03:10:13,691
other.
Oh,

3995
03:10:13,691 --> 03:10:16,000
they get in there and eat the eggs 
rather than asked.

3996
03:10:16,030 --> 03:10:17,500
Yeah.
Ground nesting birds.

3997
03:10:18,190 --> 03:10:19,380
Ducks.
Yeah.

3998
03:10:19,420 --> 03:10:22,330
Eggs and chicks and ducks and birds.
Mice.

3999
03:10:22,570 --> 03:10:24,190
Smaller ground squirrels.
Oh yeah.

4000
03:10:24,191 --> 03:10:25,024
So squirrels.
Ground squirrels are just little 

4001
03:10:26,380 --> 03:10:27,540
monsters.
Yeah.

4002
03:10:27,850 --> 03:10:28,683
That's why we feel bad about them.
They're the little evil little 

4003
03:10:31,691 --> 03:10:33,580
mediators.
So what?

4004
03:10:34,290 --> 03:10:36,010
Coyotes,
I guess probably get something.

4005
03:10:36,190 --> 03:10:37,023
Yeah,
but the problem is they dig into holes 

4006
03:10:37,961 --> 03:10:39,520
and the coyotes have a hard time 
catching them.

4007
03:10:39,640 --> 03:10:43,990
Too dark to that fucking hole so quick.
I don't think it's an effective method.

4008
03:10:43,991 --> 03:10:44,824
I don't think they have a lot of 
effective methods of eradicating them 

4009
03:10:46,511 --> 03:10:47,830
other than like poison and shit.

4010
03:10:47,830 --> 03:10:49,180
If I had a guest.
What about those?

4011
03:10:49,181 --> 03:10:51,850
Rat Terriers in the spurlock shot?
Remember that?

4012
03:10:51,851 --> 03:10:52,870
God,
it was amazing.

4013
03:10:52,990 --> 03:10:56,740
They actually hunt rats.
I haven't seen the film though.

4014
03:10:57,280 --> 03:11:00,850
They tear these rats apart.
They live for it.

4015
03:11:01,050 --> 03:11:01,883
So they live for.
They are in their glory when they let 

4016
03:11:04,031 --> 03:11:06,640
them loose with these terriers.
Go correct.

4017
03:11:06,670 --> 03:11:07,503
That's like Jack Russel terriers and 
that's why those little fuckers are so 

4018
03:11:10,061 --> 03:11:10,894
hyper because they're rat killers.
It's like it's fucking dawn and the 

4019
03:11:14,351 --> 03:11:19,351
dad's like watching zombies them apart.
It is the grab and shake.

4020
03:11:19,521 --> 03:11:20,354
I'm so happy right now.
This is the greatest thing that happens 

4021
03:11:24,191 --> 03:11:27,730
to these dogs is hunting.
Fucking look at that and go,

4022
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:30,700
Oh yeah,
look at the fucking rat.

4023
03:11:30,701 --> 03:11:32,290
Try to get away.
And they just shaking it.

4024
03:11:32,350 --> 03:11:33,730
Whoa.
That is amazing.

4025
03:11:33,731 --> 03:11:34,564
Yeah.
I guess the guys are helping them that 

4026
03:11:35,371 --> 03:11:36,310
they're digging them up.

4027
03:11:36,340 --> 03:11:37,690
Yeah.
That's the idea.

4028
03:11:39,440 --> 03:11:40,273
God.
Laughter of children as you're watching 

4029
03:11:43,380 --> 03:11:48,380
her mother get ripped apart by monsters 
there in the dirt here and that.

4030
03:11:49,631 --> 03:11:50,464
These,
these guys are digging them out of the 

4031
03:11:52,070 --> 03:11:54,640
hole.
And as they dig them out of the holes,

4032
03:11:54,820 --> 03:11:57,490
the rats explained the dogs know that.
Go to look for it.

4033
03:11:57,580 --> 03:11:59,350
Yeah.
Wagging their tails.

4034
03:11:59,500 --> 03:12:01,000
There's so happy,
dude.

4035
03:12:01,630 --> 03:12:03,490
It's so nuts.
It's crazy.

4036
03:12:03,520 --> 03:12:05,740
You can almost engineer any animal.
Oh,

4037
03:12:05,741 --> 03:12:06,640
there's one.
Got It.

4038
03:12:06,670 --> 03:12:09,840
Got It.
Jesus Christ moving.

4039
03:12:09,950 --> 03:12:12,550
Yeah.
And then what did they do?

4040
03:12:12,580 --> 03:12:15,660
They're not eating them apart.
They were tearing them apart.

4041
03:12:16,150 --> 03:12:18,640
They're eating.
Just like killing him.

4042
03:12:18,730 --> 03:12:20,140
Well,
they probably eat so much.

4043
03:12:20,141 --> 03:12:22,260
They're stuffed now that just,
uh,

4044
03:12:22,570 --> 03:12:25,720
I'm sure they eat some of it though and 
that's a whole thing of that last one.

4045
03:12:25,721 --> 03:12:26,554
It looked like he was bringing it over,
like maybe they're trained to put them 

4046
03:12:28,841 --> 03:12:30,790
in a bag or something.
That would be clutch.

4047
03:12:30,820 --> 03:12:35,040
Maybe you got to do something with the 
body's a golden retrievers and stuff.

4048
03:12:35,050 --> 03:12:36,220
Right.
Then the ducks.

4049
03:12:36,221 --> 03:12:37,054
Right.
Why?

4050
03:12:37,360 --> 03:12:41,110
Why,
why are you so fascinated with this part

4051
03:12:41,111 --> 03:12:41,944
in nature?
Like sometimes I got to be careful with 

4052
03:12:44,081 --> 03:12:45,250
your feet,
man,

4053
03:12:45,260 --> 03:12:47,050
because it's like.
I know man,

4054
03:12:47,051 --> 03:12:48,140
if you like,
if like you,

4055
03:12:48,310 --> 03:12:49,320
I don't look at it.
But yeah,

4056
03:12:49,330 --> 03:12:51,830
inevitably if you tweet nature's,
what do you say?

4057
03:12:51,831 --> 03:12:52,510
Nature's

4058
03:12:52,510 --> 03:12:53,380
bitch.
Uh,

4059
03:12:53,420 --> 03:12:54,440
no.
He says nature is.

4060
03:12:54,620 --> 03:12:55,453
What do you say?
What's the thing you say native friends 

4061
03:12:57,010 --> 03:12:58,150
are scary.
Birch,

4062
03:12:58,260 --> 03:13:00,390
something like that.
If I see that I'm not watching this,

4063
03:13:00,890 --> 03:13:02,110
she's going to be awful.
Let's get.

4064
03:13:02,180 --> 03:13:04,100
But why do you.
Why do you?

4065
03:13:04,190 --> 03:13:07,670
Yeah,
why are you so interested in that aspect

4066
03:13:07,671 --> 03:13:08,860
of nature?
Well,

4067
03:13:08,900 --> 03:13:10,790
super extreme,
right?

4068
03:13:10,791 --> 03:13:12,770
I mean this is an extreme event 
happening here.

4069
03:13:12,800 --> 03:13:13,633
One life form is exploding on another 
life form and it seems like it's 

4070
03:13:17,920 --> 03:13:20,900
designed to do that.
When you see a Jaguar,

4071
03:13:20,901 --> 03:13:21,734
Kyla Cayman and grab it in the back of 
its neck and bite into a fucking 

4072
03:13:25,041 --> 03:13:27,710
crocodile and drag it in between its 
legs,

4073
03:13:27,711 --> 03:13:28,544
up the beach to eat it.
You're seeing one of the most extreme 

4074
03:13:31,521 --> 03:13:32,354
things that exists in the world.
You're seeing a life form consuming 

4075
03:13:35,841 --> 03:13:38,650
another life form with its face,
killing her,

4076
03:13:38,810 --> 03:13:39,643
like eliminating it from us dimension 
with its teeth at a very specific part 

4077
03:13:43,161 --> 03:13:43,994
of its body and it seems like it's 
designed to do that and that's the only 

4078
03:13:46,701 --> 03:13:47,534
way you keep these populations and 
control the populations have a built in 

4079
03:13:50,361 --> 03:13:54,710
system and we want to look at it through
the gobs of our civilization and through

4080
03:13:54,711 --> 03:13:55,940
what we've accepted.

4081
03:13:55,940 --> 03:13:59,090
This is a pet and this is an animal that
you eat and you never eat.

4082
03:13:59,091 --> 03:14:03,170
Your pat and we have all these weird 
little sort of distinctions and cultural

4083
03:14:03,171 --> 03:14:05,570
ideas that we've attached to animal 
life,

4084
03:14:05,600 --> 03:14:09,200
but he watched them in their world.
Their world is fucking.

4085
03:14:09,560 --> 03:14:14,000
It's unbelievably ruthless,
unbelievably ruthless.

4086
03:14:14,150 --> 03:14:18,680
Like our ideas of animals have become so
strange because we keep,

4087
03:14:18,681 --> 03:14:19,514
some of them,
we keep them around us and we feed them 

4088
03:14:21,980 --> 03:14:22,813
so they're like really sweet to us,
but there's not a fucking animal in all 

4089
03:14:26,061 --> 03:14:30,890
of nature that is so sweet with the 
other animals around it.

4090
03:14:31,710 --> 03:14:34,410
Just many animals that are sweet with 
the other animals around them.

4091
03:14:34,411 --> 03:14:35,980
All hurt animals for example.
No,

4092
03:14:35,990 --> 03:14:36,860
that's what I mean.
Social,

4093
03:14:36,910 --> 03:14:39,660
what I mean like Jaguars and antelopes 
aren't buddies.

4094
03:14:40,200 --> 03:14:41,610
Well,
when the Jaguar is eaton,

4095
03:14:41,820 --> 03:14:42,653
he can walk right through the middle of 
the hurt and they won't even run away 

4096
03:14:44,671 --> 03:14:46,530
because they know he's not hungry.
Oh,

4097
03:14:46,531 --> 03:14:49,800
but that's so crazy to think that's like
a murderer and kills one of your buddies

4098
03:14:49,801 --> 03:14:50,634
and eat something.
You'll be cool just wandering around 

4099
03:14:51,631 --> 03:14:53,170
that,
but they're not visitors.

4100
03:14:53,410 --> 03:14:54,660
They're eating.
They're eating.

4101
03:14:55,650 --> 03:15:00,030
Their interactions are incredibly 
ruthless when they wrap it,

4102
03:15:00,360 --> 03:15:01,193
but see I.
This is something I write about in this 

4103
03:15:02,730 --> 03:15:03,563
book I'm working on still,
which is the lack of proportionality in 

4104
03:15:09,691 --> 03:15:13,380
this argument because what's your.
This nature is ruthless red in tooth and

4105
03:15:13,381 --> 03:15:14,214
claw thing.
That's been very popular for a long 

4106
03:15:15,961 --> 03:15:16,794
time,
but the real well it's real when it's 

4107
03:15:18,781 --> 03:15:19,614
real,
but it's also real that we die in agony 

4108
03:15:22,130 --> 03:15:22,963
and often our agony is extended by 
medicine to last much longer than that 

4109
03:15:26,911 --> 03:15:27,744
mouse that just got eaten by the score.
I'm fascinated by death by these 

4110
03:15:31,681 --> 03:15:34,260
interactions,
but what I'm saying is that the,

4111
03:15:35,160 --> 03:15:35,993
the conclusion to draw from those 
interactions that therefore nature is 

4112
03:15:40,291 --> 03:15:41,124
this battlefield misrepresents what 
actually happens in nature when 

4113
03:15:46,950 --> 03:15:49,050
predation happens,
it can be nasty of.

4114
03:15:49,500 --> 03:15:50,010
Right,
but that's

4115
03:15:50,010 --> 03:15:50,843
what I'm saying.
I'm not looking at the entire nature as 

4116
03:15:52,351 --> 03:15:55,170
a whole and making this distinction.
This is the only thing interesting about

4117
03:15:55,171 --> 03:15:55,801
nature.
No,

4118
03:15:55,801 --> 03:15:56,220
no,
no.

4119
03:15:56,220 --> 03:15:59,970
I'm saying when I just the depiction of 
nature as being ruthless.

4120
03:16:00,060 --> 03:16:00,893
Well,
it is in that moment that is nature and 

4121
03:16:02,111 --> 03:16:04,440
that isn't that moment and in that 
moment exists.

4122
03:16:04,441 --> 03:16:07,500
The only reason why these predators can 
exist is because they have to be killing

4123
03:16:07,501 --> 03:16:08,940
things all over the world.
I mean,

4124
03:16:08,941 --> 03:16:09,774
every place where there's a wolf,
it means the wolf is alive because it's 

4125
03:16:12,091 --> 03:16:12,924
eating things,
which means it's killing things all day 

4126
03:16:14,071 --> 03:16:14,904
long.
I mean,

4127
03:16:14,910 --> 03:16:17,610
that's not a.
that's not an inaccurate depiction.

4128
03:16:17,611 --> 03:16:20,570
The thing is there's so many things.
There's so many elk exist,

4129
03:16:20,650 --> 03:16:21,483
so many wolves.
Most of the time the elk aren't getting 

4130
03:16:22,951 --> 03:16:23,784
killed by wolves,
but wolves are killing an elk almost 

4131
03:16:26,281 --> 03:16:27,114
every store,
so it's just a matter how you look at 

4132
03:16:28,381 --> 03:16:29,330
it.
So it's just,

4133
03:16:29,331 --> 03:16:30,164
it's correct to say diminishing the 
ruthless aspect of it because you're 

4134
03:16:33,751 --> 03:16:34,850
looking at the overall picture,

4135
03:16:34,900 --> 03:16:36,380
but.
But I'm not diminishing it.

4136
03:16:36,390 --> 03:16:37,223
What I'm saying is that that's one 
perspective on it and actually in terms 

4137
03:16:40,291 --> 03:16:43,800
of proportion,
it's a minor perspective on it.

4138
03:16:44,070 --> 03:16:44,903
For example,
I was watching this nature thing and 

4139
03:16:46,351 --> 03:16:47,184
there were these seals playing in the 
waves and then the du Du du Du du Du du 

4140
03:16:50,461 --> 03:16:51,294
Du to start in this great white comes up
and hits one of the seals and they slow 

4141
03:16:55,561 --> 03:16:58,540
it down to one 40th natural speeds.
ORC.

4142
03:16:58,710 --> 03:17:00,810
All right,
well I think it was a great way.

4143
03:17:01,050 --> 03:17:03,120
It may have been an Orca at same,
same thing,

4144
03:17:03,850 --> 03:17:04,683
and this seal lands in its mouth and you
see a crunching the seal and the blood 

4145
03:17:08,041 --> 03:17:12,540
running down and the narration is nature
is ruthless and there's the never ending

4146
03:17:12,541 --> 03:17:14,340
struggle for survival and Yada,
Yada,

4147
03:17:14,341 --> 03:17:16,670
Yada,
and so I'm looking at that.

4148
03:17:16,690 --> 03:17:19,980
I'm thinking,
how long do harbor seals live?

4149
03:17:19,980 --> 03:17:21,030
So I look it up.
Online.

4150
03:17:21,031 --> 03:17:25,710
Harbor Seals live about 25 to 30 years.
I've seen a lot of seals lying around on

4151
03:17:25,711 --> 03:17:28,110
rocks,
having a good time not stressed out.

4152
03:17:28,740 --> 03:17:32,460
I don't see a lot of high stress seals 
and so I think it's like,

4153
03:17:32,670 --> 03:17:33,381
okay,
this seal,

4154
03:17:33,381 --> 03:17:36,990
let's say live 25 years.
It's hanging out eating Sushi,

4155
03:17:36,991 --> 03:17:38,310
having a good time.
Then boom,

4156
03:17:38,311 --> 03:17:39,144
it's dead so quickly that we have to 
slow this down to one 40th of normal 

4157
03:17:42,901 --> 03:17:43,734
speed so you can enjoy this death porn.
That's a tiny sliver of that seals 

4158
03:17:49,510 --> 03:17:54,510
existence and we're depicting nature as 
this incredibly ruthless,

4159
03:17:55,111 --> 03:17:55,640
horrible.
We'll

4160
03:17:55,640 --> 03:17:59,240
bloody place.
That's just inaccurate.

4161
03:17:59,600 --> 03:18:00,950
Well,
it's not in that moment.

4162
03:18:01,280 --> 03:18:03,920
Not In that moment,
but you can't ignore that in moment.

4163
03:18:03,950 --> 03:18:04,731
No,
of course not.

4164
03:18:04,731 --> 03:18:05,564
That moment is the reason,
but that moment is the reason why this 

4165
03:18:07,251 --> 03:18:11,420
seals population is controlled moment is
the reason why the shark can.

4166
03:18:11,570 --> 03:18:13,340
Oh yeah.
It all has to be there.

4167
03:18:13,341 --> 03:18:14,780
I agree with you,
but I disagree with you.

4168
03:18:14,930 --> 03:18:15,763
I agree with you.
I see you're saying that there's way 

4169
03:18:16,911 --> 03:18:19,520
more going on than just as tooth Fang 
claw.

4170
03:18:19,820 --> 03:18:20,653
I don't.
I'm not looking at it from a moral 

4171
03:18:21,681 --> 03:18:22,514
perspective.
I'm looking at it from a like a chaotic 

4172
03:18:23,901 --> 03:18:24,621
perspective.
I'm like,

4173
03:18:24,621 --> 03:18:25,454
it is fascinating.
These to these schools of tuna that we 

4174
03:18:28,610 --> 03:18:30,680
scoop up with nets.
They're out there,

4175
03:18:30,681 --> 03:18:31,514
Jack and little fish.
That's why they're in schools because 

4176
03:18:33,240 --> 03:18:34,073
they operate more efficiently that way 
and they're chasing down sardines and 

4177
03:18:36,501 --> 03:18:39,410
fucking them up and that's oftentimes 
how you catch fish.

4178
03:18:39,500 --> 03:18:42,770
When I was in,
when I was a tuna fishing in Mexico,

4179
03:18:43,030 --> 03:18:46,550
we're catching amberjack or skipjack,
I forget,

4180
03:18:46,700 --> 03:18:47,533
but you would find these pools of bait 
fish bullet going crazy on the surface 

4181
03:18:51,641 --> 03:18:52,474
of the water because the tune and were 
all ganging up on and Jack it up and 

4182
03:18:55,631 --> 03:18:56,464
then he got the Pelicans and top attack.
Cc the birds and then you would see the 

4183
03:19:00,221 --> 03:19:02,050
froth of the water and then these fish 
would just.

4184
03:19:02,440 --> 03:19:03,273
They'd go crazy and fuck up these little
bait fish and you would literally just 

4185
03:19:05,501 --> 03:19:06,334
cast into this football field size 
swirling in the ocean and these fish 

4186
03:19:10,841 --> 03:19:11,674
would just bite it and you would just 
catch them up almost instantly so that 

4187
03:19:14,560 --> 03:19:17,320
that is not the whole ocean all the 
time,

4188
03:19:17,500 --> 03:19:19,970
but that's still real.
Like this is real.

4189
03:19:19,990 --> 03:19:22,060
I'm not denying the reality.
I'm talking to proportion.

4190
03:19:22,600 --> 03:19:23,433
I agree,
but the thing that I find the most 

4191
03:19:24,701 --> 03:19:28,600
fascinating for whatever fucked up 
reason is when the water,

4192
03:19:28,840 --> 03:19:29,673
the water buffalo comes out the line and
the line ducks under the water buffalo 

4193
03:19:32,911 --> 03:19:36,340
and grabs it by its neck and rolled it 
over and crushes it.

4194
03:19:36,341 --> 03:19:37,330
Saying,
I just,

4195
03:19:37,420 --> 03:19:42,420
I am fascinated by the idea that all 
moral judgments aside nature has somehow

4196
03:19:45,220 --> 03:19:50,220
engineered a Jaguar and a cayman,
and then there's Jaguar looked at Cayman

4197
03:19:50,920 --> 03:19:51,753
was like,
ah,

4198
03:19:51,800 --> 03:19:55,780
to figure out how to put that in me.
And he snuck up,

4199
03:19:55,840 --> 03:19:59,090
swam in the water,
snuck up on a goddamn crocodile,

4200
03:19:59,470 --> 03:20:01,560
shopped on its back.
It's an equity.

4201
03:20:01,690 --> 03:20:03,730
There's a lot of cool shit.
I like watching.

4202
03:20:03,731 --> 03:20:04,564
Jaguars is real.
I liked watching Jaguars when they get 

4203
03:20:06,101 --> 03:20:08,870
ahold of psychedelic plants.
Have you ever seen that?

4204
03:20:10,950 --> 03:20:11,783
There's a,
there's this type of vine that's rich 

4205
03:20:13,931 --> 03:20:14,764
and dmt that Jaguars will chew on and 
then they literally just lie on their 

4206
03:20:18,371 --> 03:20:19,204
back and they're just staring out into 
space trip and balls like catnip for 

4207
03:20:22,010 --> 03:20:24,820
Jaguar.
But if they think it's Psychedelic,

4208
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:28,480
they think that might be when you have 
all these Jaguar dreams,

4209
03:20:28,481 --> 03:20:29,314
when people take Iowasca,
it might be that the Jaguar is 

4210
03:20:31,721 --> 03:20:33,840
interfacing with the same dimension that
you will.

4211
03:20:33,841 --> 03:20:35,730
Oh,
so that's the reason why.

4212
03:20:35,980 --> 03:20:36,813
Because we know that these jaguars do 
take these psychedelic plants and we 

4213
03:20:40,031 --> 03:20:42,550
know that these psychedelic plants,
when they were first discovered,

4214
03:20:42,820 --> 03:20:46,420
they were trying to call.
I'm harming,

4215
03:20:46,450 --> 03:20:47,130
is uh,
the,

4216
03:20:47,130 --> 03:20:48,370
the uh,
the chemical,

4217
03:20:48,550 --> 03:20:53,020
but they were trying to call it 
telepathy theme was the same as harming.

4218
03:20:53,200 --> 03:20:56,470
They had to run tests on it and find out
that there was,

4219
03:20:56,471 --> 03:20:57,304
it was already an established molecule 
that was an already established a 

4220
03:21:00,520 --> 03:21:01,353
compound.

4221
03:21:01,750 --> 03:21:02,583
So the reason why they call it telepathy
was because people were experiencing 

4222
03:21:05,951 --> 03:21:08,650
group states of consciousness while they
were taking this stuff,

4223
03:21:09,040 --> 03:21:09,873
so they're thinking that these people 
that do Iowasca and have these trips 

4224
03:21:13,901 --> 03:21:18,070
with Jaguars,
they literally might be interacting with

4225
03:21:18,071 --> 03:21:18,904
Jaguars who were also tripping.
Like I see this thing is just eating 

4226
03:21:21,881 --> 03:21:25,810
these leaves and lion dyads back clearly
in an altered state,

4227
03:21:26,740 --> 03:21:29,590
just rolling around on its back with its
paws up in the air,

4228
03:21:29,591 --> 03:21:32,800
staring at things that aren't there 
staring at.

4229
03:21:32,801 --> 03:21:33,634
It's like in Brooklyn right now with a 
bunch of fucking people on some loft in 

4230
03:21:39,671 --> 03:21:43,160
Brooklyn with some fucking glass 
blowers.

4231
03:21:43,170 --> 03:21:46,250
A couple of accountants.
Its eyes dilate.

4232
03:21:46,251 --> 03:21:51,080
It's mine's going back and forth.
That is so fucking wild.

4233
03:21:51,081 --> 03:21:51,914
I'm going to Peru in a couple of weeks.
You're going to get down with the funky 

4234
03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:56,560
funky medicine plant medicine.

4235
03:21:56,590 --> 03:21:57,311
Yeah.
Yeah.

4236
03:21:57,311 --> 03:22:00,080
If the right situation presents itself,
that's the thing,

4237
03:22:00,081 --> 03:22:00,914
right?
The problem and the people that say 

4238
03:22:01,641 --> 03:22:03,420
plant medicine,
they all make go,

4239
03:22:05,030 --> 03:22:05,863
oh yeah.
They're like really into like other the 

4240
03:22:07,040 --> 03:22:08,000
plant medicine.
You're like,

4241
03:22:08,500 --> 03:22:09,710
okay,
yeah.

4242
03:22:09,711 --> 03:22:10,544
Okay.
You might be cool if you used those 

4243
03:22:11,961 --> 03:22:15,230
terms all the time or you might be one 
of those fucking Weirdos.

4244
03:22:15,530 --> 03:22:15,960
You know,
there's,

4245
03:22:15,960 --> 03:22:16,793
there's,
there's a bunch of people that are into 

4246
03:22:17,841 --> 03:22:22,220
the psychedelic world that they know 
they would have been into the moonies if

4247
03:22:22,221 --> 03:22:23,780
the moonies found them.
Right.

4248
03:22:23,840 --> 03:22:26,240
There are lots of different plants that 
they use though.

4249
03:22:26,241 --> 03:22:27,074
It's not just Iowasca,
so if you just use it as a general term 

4250
03:22:29,841 --> 03:22:31,240
there,
San Pedro and all the time.

4251
03:22:31,310 --> 03:22:33,730
I'm fully aware.
It's just the people love saying it.

4252
03:22:33,740 --> 03:22:34,720
Yeah.
They love saying.

4253
03:22:36,420 --> 03:22:39,470
I mean legally it's probably better to 
use the term plant medicine.

4254
03:22:39,680 --> 03:22:43,850
It is so pretentious that aren't going 
to get you stopped at any borders.

4255
03:22:44,030 --> 03:22:45,620
Yeah,
I think it's pretentious.

4256
03:22:45,621 --> 03:22:46,454
Like I get it.
I understand why you're calling it a 

4257
03:22:48,621 --> 03:22:51,560
plant medicine,
but like when I'm getting stoned,

4258
03:22:52,280 --> 03:22:54,200
I'm not thinking,
let me take my medicine.

4259
03:22:54,830 --> 03:22:55,790
I'm thinking,
let me get.

4260
03:22:55,820 --> 03:22:56,653
I want to get fucking high man.
I wanna I wanna like get high play with 

4261
03:22:59,180 --> 03:23:00,760
synthesizers.
When I'm like,

4262
03:23:00,860 --> 03:23:05,630
when I'm taking Roba Tesson I'm thinking
I'm taking medicine right now.

4263
03:23:05,631 --> 03:23:06,690
It tastes like shit.
It's gonna.

4264
03:23:06,710 --> 03:23:08,660
Make me fall asleep.
I just honestly,

4265
03:23:08,661 --> 03:23:12,480
the reason I don't like the term plant 
medicine is because I think it,

4266
03:23:13,000 --> 03:23:13,833
and forgive me out there you guys,
but I feel like in some small way 

4267
03:23:17,211 --> 03:23:21,410
diminishes all the other reasons I want 
to take this fucking plant.

4268
03:23:21,650 --> 03:23:23,360
Like when I'm,
when I'm like,

4269
03:23:23,361 --> 03:23:24,194
you know,
and this is such a degraded thing to 

4270
03:23:25,911 --> 03:23:27,500
say,
so I'm sorry,

4271
03:23:27,501 --> 03:23:29,660
but remember when used to be sponsored 
by fleshlight.

4272
03:23:29,720 --> 03:23:31,790
Yes.
And you fucked a flashlight,

4273
03:23:31,791 --> 03:23:33,930
right?
And it made you come shut.

4274
03:23:33,950 --> 03:23:34,783
You weren't thinking as you're fucking 
the flashlight for the pure joy of like 

4275
03:23:39,470 --> 03:23:42,770
experiencing an orgasm with this weird 
dumb thing.

4276
03:23:42,771 --> 03:23:44,750
This tube.
You're not thinking to yourself,

4277
03:23:45,050 --> 03:23:47,880
I'm giving myself medicine.
Now you're thinking,

4278
03:23:47,881 --> 03:23:50,000
I don't want to assume this is you for 
you,

4279
03:23:50,001 --> 03:23:50,834
for I want to come in the same way like 
with some of these substances that he'd 

4280
03:23:54,820 --> 03:23:56,690
never get high with you again,
man.

4281
03:24:00,370 --> 03:24:01,203
The fucking house plants.
It's just sometimes it's a plant 

4282
03:24:05,001 --> 03:24:08,390
medicine sometimes.
Why do you get high?

4283
03:24:08,391 --> 03:24:09,224
Are you saying that sometimes you get 
high just because it feels good to 

4284
03:24:11,200 --> 03:24:13,670
behind?
That's exactly what I'm saying.

4285
03:24:13,671 --> 03:24:15,380
That's why God made nitric oxide.

4286
03:24:16,060 --> 03:24:16,893
Can didn't you get your license with me 
from a black guy with dreadlocks was a 

4287
03:24:21,401 --> 03:24:23,720
doctor,
was calling it the medicine wasn't a,

4288
03:24:23,770 --> 03:24:25,120
didn't you?
And I go to that place.

4289
03:24:25,180 --> 03:24:26,013
I don't remember this.
This was in the early days when it was 

4290
03:24:30,341 --> 03:24:32,090
like sketchy,
sketchy,

4291
03:24:32,100 --> 03:24:34,030
regrow ops were sketchy.
He didn't want people to know.

4292
03:24:34,031 --> 03:24:37,780
Where you grow up was it wasn't legal 
across the board.

4293
03:24:37,900 --> 03:24:40,000
You had to get a doctor's 
recommendation.

4294
03:24:40,030 --> 03:24:41,770
I remember we walked into the doctor's 
office.

4295
03:24:41,790 --> 03:24:42,623
Tell me if you remember this.
It was just cool black guy with 

4296
03:24:44,671 --> 03:24:47,850
dreadlocks and he had one of those 
volcano vapor bags,

4297
03:24:47,851 --> 03:24:50,430
but it was extra long.
He made an extra long bag,

4298
03:24:50,610 --> 03:24:53,040
like a normal volcano.
Bay bags like that big.

4299
03:24:53,160 --> 03:24:53,993
He had one that was like three feet was.
It was cartoonish and as soon as he saw 

4300
03:24:57,180 --> 03:24:59,250
us like,
y'all look sick,

4301
03:25:00,840 --> 03:25:02,820
need medicine,
come on man,

4302
03:25:02,821 --> 03:25:03,654
y'all need to layer.
And it was baked out of his fucking 

4303
03:25:06,061 --> 03:25:06,894
mind.
He was a legitimate doctor and he had 

4304
03:25:08,190 --> 03:25:09,180
full on dreadlocks.

4305
03:25:09,220 --> 03:25:09,881
No,
that wasn't me.

4306
03:25:09,881 --> 03:25:11,460
I wasn't with you.
I would not that.

4307
03:25:11,470 --> 03:25:12,970
That was not me,
but you know,

4308
03:25:12,971 --> 03:25:13,930
again,
it is healing.

4309
03:25:13,931 --> 03:25:16,600
I think it is a medicine and it can be.
Obviously it's in Madison.

4310
03:25:16,601 --> 03:25:19,240
It is a medicine that heals people for 
sure.

4311
03:25:19,570 --> 03:25:23,050
I just think it's not just a medicine.
I think it's much more than that.

4312
03:25:23,051 --> 03:25:27,190
Maybe we just don't have the language to
describe what it is necessarily yet,

4313
03:25:27,220 --> 03:25:30,220
but people aren't or aren't taken 
Iowasca to field good.

4314
03:25:30,430 --> 03:25:34,000
But it's not like a recreational drug.
Oh yeah.

4315
03:25:34,001 --> 03:25:35,320
You know what?
I agree with you there,

4316
03:25:35,321 --> 03:25:36,154
but I think that a lot of people are not
necessarily taking Iowasca because they 

4317
03:25:39,881 --> 03:25:40,714
are.
They want something more out of their 

4318
03:25:42,281 --> 03:25:43,070
life.
They want to.

4319
03:25:43,070 --> 03:25:46,660
They were or they want some novelty.
They want a heightened experience.

4320
03:25:46,661 --> 03:25:47,494
Many people are taking your Iwatch is 
they're chronically fucking depressed 

4321
03:25:50,381 --> 03:25:51,214
and they're desperate and they need help
and the people who are administering it 

4322
03:25:53,741 --> 03:25:55,500
that are legitimate,
they,

4323
03:25:55,510 --> 03:25:56,490
they're like dog.

4324
03:25:56,530 --> 03:25:57,363
They're like doctors.
Their understanding of these plants is 

4325
03:26:00,360 --> 03:26:03,930
as astounding and deep and I get all 
that and,

4326
03:26:03,950 --> 03:26:04,650
and I,
I,

4327
03:26:04,650 --> 03:26:05,770
and I'm,
and I'm so.

4328
03:26:05,771 --> 03:26:08,140
I'm certainly not opposed to that 
concept.

4329
03:26:08,141 --> 03:26:11,440
I'm just saying the term plant medicine 
itself,

4330
03:26:11,710 --> 03:26:16,710
it feels like somehow it's less romantic
than I picture psychedelics,

4331
03:26:17,090 --> 03:26:20,020
to me,
psychedelics or a combination,

4332
03:26:20,350 --> 03:26:23,080
a hedonic tool,
a portal,

4333
03:26:23,350 --> 03:26:26,050
a means of communion,
a spiritual practice,

4334
03:26:26,330 --> 03:26:28,270
um,
and also in medicine.

4335
03:26:28,271 --> 03:26:29,620
But there are all those other things 
too.

4336
03:26:29,621 --> 03:26:32,110
I just think it's more than a medicine.
That's all.

4337
03:26:32,111 --> 03:26:34,480
It's something bigger than medicine 
though.

4338
03:26:34,481 --> 03:26:36,940
All those things I just mentioned you 
could call it medicine.

4339
03:26:37,210 --> 03:26:38,043
It's just reducing either some expansion
of healing to that goes beyond the 

4340
03:26:40,961 --> 03:26:44,260
physical and into the psychological and 
emotional and spiritual,

4341
03:26:44,261 --> 03:26:46,570
you know,
which makes me sound like a Hippie,

4342
03:26:46,571 --> 03:26:47,404
but I just got schooled.
I was using the term hallucinogens 

4343
03:26:51,370 --> 03:26:52,203
reflexively and I had Jim Fadiman on my 
podcast who's the microdosing guru and 

4344
03:26:57,341 --> 03:26:59,260
he very quickly said,
you know,

4345
03:26:59,320 --> 03:27:00,670
the,
the Scott,

4346
03:27:00,680 --> 03:27:01,890
a lot of baggage,
Hulu,

4347
03:27:01,930 --> 03:27:04,560
because you don't actually hallucinate,
you know,

4348
03:27:04,570 --> 03:27:05,410
and it's like,
well,

4349
03:27:05,411 --> 03:27:06,650
you're right.
Psychedelics is,

4350
03:27:06,910 --> 03:27:09,220
is definitely a better word for it.
It's a better term.

4351
03:27:09,240 --> 03:27:13,740
But what is happening when you're 
closing your eyes when you're doing dmt?

4352
03:27:14,220 --> 03:27:18,480
I think it's,
it's entirely likely that we don't know.

4353
03:27:18,720 --> 03:27:19,553
And that you,
you might be actually interfacing with 

4354
03:27:21,481 --> 03:27:22,314
some other place,
but you're seeing things that seemed 

4355
03:27:24,901 --> 03:27:26,580
like they must be hallucinations.
Yeah.

4356
03:27:26,770 --> 03:27:27,603
It seems like something is interacting 
with your visual perception abilities 

4357
03:27:31,291 --> 03:27:33,600
where your eyes are seeing things that 
are impossible.

4358
03:27:33,930 --> 03:27:34,763
Now is that because you're actually 
there and you actually are experiencing 

4359
03:27:36,691 --> 03:27:40,950
these impossible things or is it a trick
that's happening with chemicals and your

4360
03:27:40,960 --> 03:27:44,730
eyeballs and your brain and 
neurochemistry and that's.

4361
03:27:44,990 --> 03:27:47,510
That's a question to be answered by 
people far smarter than I.

4362
03:27:47,560 --> 03:27:49,930
and what is the difference between those
two things?

4363
03:27:49,960 --> 03:27:53,410
To what extent is your experience your 
reality?

4364
03:27:53,440 --> 03:27:54,520
Yeah.
That's the real question,

4365
03:27:54,521 --> 03:27:56,440
right?
We want to think that if you can't weigh

4366
03:27:56,441 --> 03:27:58,990
something on a scale,
if I can bang on it with a hammer,

4367
03:27:58,991 --> 03:28:01,210
if I can't draw on it with a marker,
then it's not a real thing.

4368
03:28:01,320 --> 03:28:02,130
Right?
Right,

4369
03:28:02,130 --> 03:28:04,180
right.
But if you said this,

4370
03:28:04,181 --> 03:28:05,014
like if you had an experience with God 
where you literally were transported 

4371
03:28:07,811 --> 03:28:08,644
into heaven and you had a communication 
with God and then God gave you love and 

4372
03:28:11,921 --> 03:28:12,754
wisdom and then you came back down to 
Earth into your body and you this 

4373
03:28:17,410 --> 03:28:18,243
actually did happen,
or you took a drug and the exact same 

4374
03:28:21,491 --> 03:28:26,491
experience took place in every way,
shape and form the exact amount of time,

4375
03:28:27,070 --> 03:28:29,800
the exact feeling,
the exact message,

4376
03:28:29,890 --> 03:28:30,723
the exact visuals,
the exact reexamining of your life when 

4377
03:28:33,401 --> 03:28:35,740
you return,
they're basically the same thing.

4378
03:28:36,040 --> 03:28:38,710
I mean,
if less you could get God in one of them

4379
03:28:38,711 --> 03:28:39,544
tuna nets and bring them back here so I 
could prove that you had God and that 

4380
03:28:43,331 --> 03:28:47,290
you weren't just tripping your fucking 
balls off basically telling me a story,

4381
03:28:47,291 --> 03:28:48,000
Bro.

4382
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:49,170
Yeah,
that'd be pissed.

4383
03:28:49,220 --> 03:28:50,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

4384
03:28:50,470 --> 03:28:51,630
I think,
I don't know.

4385
03:28:51,631 --> 03:28:52,464
I'm sure that there's like a lot of 
scientific materialist hearing that and 

4386
03:28:54,451 --> 03:28:55,410
they're like,
they're,

4387
03:28:55,440 --> 03:28:56,760
they're,
they're assholes.

4388
03:28:56,761 --> 03:29:00,780
Or like squeezing into their body.
Just in horror what you're saying,

4389
03:29:00,781 --> 03:29:02,430
because it's like they're,
they're like,

4390
03:29:02,460 --> 03:29:03,293
well,
the difference is like when you have a 

4391
03:29:05,311 --> 03:29:06,144
dream and you have this incredible dream
or a unicorn comes out of the clearing 

4392
03:29:10,081 --> 03:29:12,690
in the forest and like a rainbow shoots 
out of it's worn,

4393
03:29:12,930 --> 03:29:17,310
and then it turns into a swarm of 
fireflies that spell I love you.

4394
03:29:17,700 --> 03:29:18,780
Well,
that's like,

4395
03:29:18,980 --> 03:29:20,820
you know,
that's a really cool dream,

4396
03:29:20,920 --> 03:29:22,860
right?
But that's not real.

4397
03:29:23,100 --> 03:29:23,933
That didn't happen.
And it's completely different than if 

4398
03:29:25,831 --> 03:29:27,900
you went into a clearing,
uh,

4399
03:29:28,040 --> 03:29:30,510
and,
and saw a fucking Unicorn because if you

4400
03:29:30,511 --> 03:29:32,490
can go into clearing and see a fucking 
Unicorn,

4401
03:29:33,150 --> 03:29:36,000
tell me where the clearing is.
Let's get some nets.

4402
03:29:36,310 --> 03:29:37,970
Another thing too about,
well,

4403
03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:42,530
here's the thing about mushrooms,
mushrooms enough to stop and think about

4404
03:29:42,531 --> 03:29:45,010
the people that wrote the Bible.
Stop to think about the people that have

4405
03:29:45,020 --> 03:29:47,720
discovered mushrooms a long time ago by 
trial and error,

4406
03:29:47,721 --> 03:29:48,554
or whatever the method was.
And imagine everybody decided to get 

4407
03:29:51,051 --> 03:29:51,884
together in some field somewhere and you
all take these mushrooms and you all 

4408
03:29:54,891 --> 03:29:58,400
literally go to heaven and you have this
insane experience.

4409
03:29:58,401 --> 03:29:59,234
And then you all come back and then you 
have to write about it in your ancient 

4410
03:30:01,971 --> 03:30:02,804
tongue.
You have to write this down in Aramaic 

4411
03:30:06,080 --> 03:30:06,913
on animal skins.
You roll these up and put them in clay 

4412
03:30:09,711 --> 03:30:10,544
jars in the caves of Qumran so that 
someone someday will know this and 

4413
03:30:14,331 --> 03:30:15,860
understand what you've been through.
Well,

4414
03:30:15,861 --> 03:30:18,620
when the drought came,
the mushrooms went away and we were left

4415
03:30:18,621 --> 03:30:19,454
with nothing but stories mean you have 
to repeat the craziest thing about 

4416
03:30:23,241 --> 03:30:24,074
psychedelics,
especially the natural ones that don't 

4417
03:30:25,131 --> 03:30:25,964
kill anybody.
Is it somehow or another somebody wound 

4418
03:30:27,471 --> 03:30:28,304
up bing enough people and putting off 
disinformation out that one of the most 

4419
03:30:33,321 --> 03:30:34,154
valuable things ever in for human 
exploration ever as far as like the 

4420
03:30:37,851 --> 03:30:40,000
exploration of our mind is the

4421
03:30:40,010 --> 03:30:40,843
one,
one of the most valuable things that's 

4422
03:30:42,201 --> 03:30:47,000
ever existed for changing the way you 
view the world,

4423
03:30:47,150 --> 03:30:50,540
giving you a reset.
The one though and doesn't kill anybody,

4424
03:30:50,970 --> 03:30:51,803
it's illegal.
It's illegal in societies that are 

4425
03:30:55,500 --> 03:30:58,890
oriented in a way that that would be 
corrosive.

4426
03:30:59,370 --> 03:31:00,300
Right?
And that's,

4427
03:31:00,330 --> 03:31:04,340
that's why getting into legal,
what's legal in Peru and

4428
03:31:04,720 --> 03:31:07,220
they just decriminalized lsd.
And what is it,

4429
03:31:07,221 --> 03:31:08,150
Sweden?
Where do they do?

4430
03:31:08,151 --> 03:31:10,190
I think it was a switcher go.
Everything's legal.

4431
03:31:10,191 --> 03:31:11,570
Yeah,
Portugal's got it nailed.

4432
03:31:11,630 --> 03:31:14,090
I think in Sweden they made it a 
misdemeanor to.

4433
03:31:14,120 --> 03:31:14,953
I can't remember somewhere recently.
They just made it a misdemeanor to have 

4434
03:31:19,730 --> 03:31:24,730
to get caught with asset on the books 
for the 2018 elections for California.

4435
03:31:25,670 --> 03:31:26,503
We have to organize like,
this is something we really should 

4436
03:31:28,740 --> 03:31:32,060
really should go after this.
Like if you want to talk to me people,

4437
03:31:32,061 --> 03:31:34,560
Oh God,
that's going to go after military rooms.

4438
03:31:35,090 --> 03:31:38,000
Don't you really could change the world 
and this is not bullshit.

4439
03:31:38,001 --> 03:31:42,200
If we organized and we got a bunch of 
people to vote yes,

4440
03:31:42,201 --> 03:31:44,930
on recreational use of mushrooms for 
adults,

4441
03:31:45,140 --> 03:31:47,030
I literally think we could change the 
world.

4442
03:31:47,031 --> 03:31:47,864
That would be the best.
It could change the world because like 

4443
03:31:49,700 --> 03:31:52,610
medical marijuana,
it will spread to recreational marijuana

4444
03:31:52,611 --> 03:31:53,444
and recreational mushrooms get past and 
if they do medical mushrooms get passed 

4445
03:31:56,781 --> 03:31:58,610
and then they can start doing tests on 
mushrooms.

4446
03:31:58,880 --> 03:32:01,070
Like the John Hopkins psilocybins 
studies that they've done.

4447
03:32:01,520 --> 03:32:03,680
You would see literally a change in the 
world.

4448
03:32:03,681 --> 03:32:06,470
You would see a shift in global 
consciousness and that's not.

4449
03:32:06,720 --> 03:32:10,700
That's not a ridiculous thing to say.
It's probably true.

4450
03:32:10,730 --> 03:32:11,563
Well,
that's why Tim scully and his partner 

4451
03:32:13,101 --> 03:32:15,470
made all that orange sunshine acid.
They weren't.

4452
03:32:15,471 --> 03:32:17,750
I had him on my podcast.
He's such a sweet guy.

4453
03:32:18,140 --> 03:32:18,973
I'm not interested in money.
He could have made tons of money doing 

4454
03:32:21,411 --> 03:32:22,244
other things.
He was this child genius and he just 

4455
03:32:25,641 --> 03:32:29,270
made the acid and went to prison for it 
because he wanted to change the world.

4456
03:32:29,510 --> 03:32:30,620
He really thought it would do it.

4457
03:32:30,850 --> 03:32:35,420
Know I've been talking to you through 
email to William Leonard Pickard.

4458
03:32:35,421 --> 03:32:37,260
That dude who got busted with all that 
acid.

4459
03:32:37,280 --> 03:32:41,140
He's in jail now for like a multiple 
life sentences.

4460
03:32:41,250 --> 03:32:42,083
When they busted him,
he is the guy that was like the missile 

4461
03:32:43,491 --> 03:32:46,040
silo that.
Oh yeah.

4462
03:32:46,370 --> 03:32:47,203
Was the guy that had the girl that lived
with them and they were selling ecstasy 

4463
03:32:50,481 --> 03:32:52,220
and someone tried to kill somebody or 
something.

4464
03:32:52,250 --> 03:32:54,640
It's so crazy.
Someone got.

4465
03:32:54,680 --> 03:32:59,600
The other guy got arrested.
That girl Rad the guy out and holy shit,

4466
03:32:59,840 --> 03:33:01,610
there's a great book he wrote.
If you want to read it,

4467
03:33:01,611 --> 03:33:02,444
really trippy book,
he wrote this book called the Rose of 

4468
03:33:04,701 --> 03:33:09,701
paraklesis and it's this really cool 
book and it's kind of like flow.

4469
03:33:09,830 --> 03:33:11,840
It's very intense to read and the way 
it's written,

4470
03:33:11,841 --> 03:33:13,730
it's really not.
But um,

4471
03:33:14,270 --> 03:33:16,430
uh,
it's pretty interesting.

4472
03:33:16,431 --> 03:33:18,850
It's talking about sort of the life of 
a,

4473
03:33:18,940 --> 03:33:22,700
it's a,
the setup is a guy's going to talk to an

4474
03:33:22,701 --> 03:33:23,534
lsd chemist and a who is sort of 
explaining what it's like to have to be 

4475
03:33:29,211 --> 03:33:30,044
a secret as you have to be if you're 
manufacturing what he calls planetary 

4476
03:33:33,921 --> 03:33:36,860
doses of Lsd,
which is what they want planetary.

4477
03:33:37,620 --> 03:33:37,980
And that's

4478
03:33:37,980 --> 03:33:38,813
what they wanted to do.
That was the idea is like let's 

4479
03:33:40,351 --> 03:33:41,184
manufacturer planetary doses of this 
substance to up shift the consciousness 

4480
03:33:45,240 --> 03:33:47,400
of the planet.
And one of the things he says,

4481
03:33:47,401 --> 03:33:48,234
it's all very flowery and beautiful,
but he's talking about the lsd chemist 

4482
03:33:51,211 --> 03:33:53,460
and people being like,
this is a for profit thing.

4483
03:33:53,940 --> 03:33:54,661
And he's saying,
no,

4484
03:33:54,661 --> 03:33:55,900
you know,
for us money is,

4485
03:33:55,901 --> 03:34:00,660
is just the ability to move around.
Because when you're an lsd chemist,

4486
03:34:00,661 --> 03:34:02,100
and again,
it's all very flowery writing,

4487
03:34:02,101 --> 03:34:02,934
but he says something along the lines of
when you're standing next to the forge 

4488
03:34:06,331 --> 03:34:09,840
of the gods,
you stop thinking about money as meaning

4489
03:34:09,841 --> 03:34:12,480
anything because you're breathing in the
fumes.

4490
03:34:12,660 --> 03:34:13,493
You're broke.
You're like constantly in contact with 

4491
03:34:15,331 --> 03:34:17,790
this,
like mind expanding substance.

4492
03:34:17,940 --> 03:34:20,920
And good luck when you're mid,
you know,

4493
03:34:20,940 --> 03:34:25,170
200 microgram trip.
Good luck taking money seriously.

4494
03:34:25,210 --> 03:34:29,340
And that moment is this fucking Shit,
man.

4495
03:34:29,700 --> 03:34:31,520
This stuff's ridiculous.
You know?

4496
03:34:31,620 --> 03:34:32,520
So,
so,

4497
03:34:32,521 --> 03:34:34,110
um,
yeah man,

4498
03:34:34,111 --> 03:34:35,250
there was,
there still is,

4499
03:34:35,251 --> 03:34:36,630
I hope,
I don't know if there is,

4500
03:34:36,631 --> 03:34:37,464
but there are people who are 
manufacturing psychedelics and putting 

4501
03:34:41,131 --> 03:34:44,520
their entire lives at risk,
not because they want to make money.

4502
03:34:44,521 --> 03:34:45,354
And it could be,
maybe they started off wanting to make 

4503
03:34:46,531 --> 03:34:47,364
money,
but now that they're manufacturing it 

4504
03:34:48,871 --> 03:34:52,680
because they know of all the ways to 
shift human consciousness,

4505
03:34:52,890 --> 03:34:54,870
there's lots of ways theoretically to do
it,

4506
03:34:54,871 --> 03:34:55,320
you know,

4507
03:34:55,320 --> 03:34:56,153
can you imagine being the person who's 
responsible for literally like a 

4508
03:34:58,721 --> 03:35:01,960
swimming pool filled with acid that will
change the world.

4509
03:35:02,260 --> 03:35:02,891
Like,
you know,

4510
03:35:02,891 --> 03:35:05,110
like right in front of you.
If you could get this,

4511
03:35:05,260 --> 03:35:09,130
there would be such a hiccup and shift 
of culture.

4512
03:35:09,280 --> 03:35:10,780
I mean,
I don't know which way it would go.

4513
03:35:10,781 --> 03:35:11,614
I don't know what would happen.
I don't know how much schizophrenia you 

4514
03:35:13,091 --> 03:35:13,924
would trigger.
I don't know how many people would blow 

4515
03:35:15,041 --> 03:35:16,180
fuses.
I don't know,

4516
03:35:16,360 --> 03:35:17,193
but I do know that something would 
happen and it will know about shy evil 

4517
03:35:19,541 --> 03:35:21,460
times when this happened based or God,
right?

4518
03:35:21,461 --> 03:35:22,070
Yeah,
yeah.

4519
03:35:22,070 --> 03:35:23,110
Right.
Yeah.

4520
03:35:23,111 --> 03:35:23,944
That's what they think happened with the
Salem witch trials that literally the 

4521
03:35:28,001 --> 03:35:30,370
Erg gotten the Rod because of an early 
frost.

4522
03:35:30,371 --> 03:35:34,300
Some new fungus had grown on some of the
bread and they were able to run tests on

4523
03:35:34,301 --> 03:35:37,450
it and they believe that it has lsd like
property to it.

4524
03:35:37,580 --> 03:35:38,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

4525
03:35:38,571 --> 03:35:39,500
I mean,
that's the,

4526
03:35:39,501 --> 03:35:40,334
uh,
that's certainly one of the potential 

4527
03:35:43,041 --> 03:35:45,940
ways to like upshift consciousness,
Epi,

4528
03:35:46,130 --> 03:35:51,130
getting people having access to 
psychedelics in a consensual way.

4529
03:35:51,590 --> 03:35:52,423
You know,
like when you're fucking chomping 

4530
03:35:53,541 --> 03:35:58,541
polluted wheat and suddenly think your 
neighbors know fucking Satan.

4531
03:35:58,730 --> 03:35:59,860
Pretty scared.
That's,

4532
03:35:59,880 --> 03:36:00,713
that's different than like deciding to 
take a psychedelic in a responsible way 

4533
03:36:04,461 --> 03:36:05,294
and then understanding a little bit more
about how to be compassionate or 

4534
03:36:08,571 --> 03:36:09,710
something like that,
you know,

4535
03:36:10,250 --> 03:36:14,030
seeing yourself for the first time.
I remember seeing yourself though.

4536
03:36:14,031 --> 03:36:16,580
The first time I took mushrooms I saw 
myself and I was like,

4537
03:36:16,640 --> 03:36:18,380
oh yeah,
that's who I am.

4538
03:36:18,810 --> 03:36:20,330
You know,
like you before you do it,

4539
03:36:20,331 --> 03:36:21,164
it's like you have this idea looking in 
out and then you are separated from all 

4540
03:36:25,911 --> 03:36:26,744
of your life and you're like this entity
observing from the outside your life 

4541
03:36:31,071 --> 03:36:34,040
yourself is the first time I ever 
considered myself outside of myself.

4542
03:36:34,240 --> 03:36:35,580
Dude,
this is.

4543
03:36:35,590 --> 03:36:36,010
I'm sorry.

4544
03:36:36,010 --> 03:36:37,600
I was bringing up Rhonda us on your 
podcast.

4545
03:36:37,610 --> 03:36:40,480
A lot of them,
but one of the grading under his beads,

4546
03:36:40,510 --> 03:36:43,270
one of the great stories is one of the 
great stories is that,

4547
03:36:43,271 --> 03:36:44,410
uh,
uh,

4548
03:36:44,500 --> 03:36:47,080
you know,
he gave Lsd to Neem Karoli Baba,

4549
03:36:47,081 --> 03:36:49,900
his guru twice,
first time,

4550
03:36:49,901 --> 03:36:51,970
and you can find a youtube video of him 
telling the story.

4551
03:36:51,971 --> 03:36:53,410
It's amazing.
It gives him like,

4552
03:36:53,800 --> 03:36:54,910
you know,
Owsley,

4553
03:36:55,300 --> 03:36:56,133
Owsley kid,
Charlemagne has given him this 

4554
03:37:00,341 --> 03:37:01,174
incredible lsd.
Says it's 300 microgram tablets made by 

4555
03:37:04,601 --> 03:37:05,434
one of the great lsd chemist of our time
and he's going to need to give it to 

4556
03:37:08,501 --> 03:37:12,760
people and he gives it to.
He gives a 600 micrograms to Neem Karoli

4557
03:37:12,761 --> 03:37:15,340
Baba.
Now 600 micrograms is like,

4558
03:37:15,430 --> 03:37:16,720
fuck that.
Fuck that.

4559
03:37:16,780 --> 03:37:19,480
Fuck that.
That's just too much.

4560
03:37:19,600 --> 03:37:22,900
And neem Karoli Baba eats it.
But the way he's eating it,

4561
03:37:22,901 --> 03:37:25,840
as he's like doing this,
throwing it in his mouth and eats it,

4562
03:37:25,841 --> 03:37:26,440
nothing happens.

4563
03:37:26,440 --> 03:37:28,450
So Rom das gets back to the United 
States.

4564
03:37:28,451 --> 03:37:30,310
He's telling one of his scientists,
friends,

4565
03:37:30,550 --> 03:37:32,230
this store and a science friends,
come on,

4566
03:37:32,231 --> 03:37:34,510
dude.
He didn't fucking eat it.

4567
03:37:34,960 --> 03:37:36,400
He threw,
he palmed it.

4568
03:37:36,401 --> 03:37:39,790
He threw it over his shoulder.
This story is bullshit.

4569
03:37:39,791 --> 03:37:43,030
You got tricked.
You got hoodwinked by fucking Bob out in

4570
03:37:43,031 --> 03:37:44,380
India.
They're all out there.

4571
03:37:44,530 --> 03:37:45,363
They just want you to worship.
Then they want you to think they're 

4572
03:37:46,361 --> 03:37:47,970
powerful.
So like Rhonda is,

4573
03:37:48,000 --> 03:37:52,660
gets back to India the second time with 
acid again.

4574
03:37:52,840 --> 03:37:54,520
And this guy named Karoli Baba says to 
him,

4575
03:37:54,940 --> 03:37:59,940
when you were here last time,
what did you give me around us as says,

4576
03:38:01,690 --> 03:38:02,880
well,
I gave you lsd.

4577
03:38:03,340 --> 03:38:06,810
And he's like,
did I take it around?

4578
03:38:06,830 --> 03:38:08,770
The US is like,
I don't know,

4579
03:38:09,460 --> 03:38:10,360
and he's like,
give me more,

4580
03:38:10,361 --> 03:38:11,800
give me more.
So it gives him more.

4581
03:38:12,070 --> 03:38:14,110
And he takes these pills,
puts them in his mouth,

4582
03:38:14,650 --> 03:38:17,950
chewing them up in front of him and 
opens his mouth.

4583
03:38:17,950 --> 03:38:22,570
His mouth is coated with tablet acid.
He's taken a coordinator around us now,

4584
03:38:22,870 --> 03:38:23,703
900 Mike's of this stuff.
And so he goes under his blanket and 

4585
03:38:29,621 --> 03:38:31,870
starts shaking.
And I know people now,

4586
03:38:31,871 --> 03:38:35,020
I've seen you saw this happen,
not just him telling the story,

4587
03:38:35,200 --> 03:38:37,180
who saw it happen?
And they said like,

4588
03:38:37,181 --> 03:38:40,150
the fucking blood rushed out around us,
his face.

4589
03:38:40,450 --> 03:38:41,470
He's like,
oh my God.

4590
03:38:41,530 --> 03:38:42,520
Oh my God,
what have I done?

4591
03:38:42,521 --> 03:38:44,980
What was I fucking thinking?
I just drove this dude crate.

4592
03:38:45,220 --> 03:38:46,053
I essentially just gave an old man 900 
micrograms of fucking acid in the hills 

4593
03:38:50,291 --> 03:38:53,680
of India and he's going to go fucking 
nuts and it's going to be my fault.

4594
03:38:54,280 --> 03:38:55,360
Right?
And so,

4595
03:38:55,361 --> 03:38:56,194
like,
neem Karoli Baba comes out of the 

4596
03:38:57,011 --> 03:38:59,440
blanket,
his eyes are back in his head,

4597
03:38:59,441 --> 03:39:02,860
he's like,
and then he just goes back to completely

4598
03:39:02,861 --> 03:39:04,510
normal,
nothing,

4599
03:39:04,720 --> 03:39:07,030
no effect.
And he says to him,

4600
03:39:07,031 --> 03:39:07,864
so was he,
was he laughing what now he was putting 

4601
03:39:10,211 --> 03:39:11,400
on?
He was playing on a fuck.

4602
03:39:11,420 --> 03:39:13,590
He was playing a joke to fuck with him,
but he,

4603
03:39:13,600 --> 03:39:14,433
but,
uh,

4604
03:39:14,500 --> 03:39:15,333
but,
uh,

4605
03:39:15,670 --> 03:39:17,170
he was just fucking with.
But what,

4606
03:39:17,220 --> 03:39:17,780
what,
what,

4607
03:39:17,780 --> 03:39:18,613
uh,
what he said to him was really 

4608
03:39:20,381 --> 03:39:21,310
interesting.
We said to him,

4609
03:39:21,320 --> 03:39:22,840
was this,
he said,

4610
03:39:22,841 --> 03:39:24,640
we used it.
They used to have something like this in

4611
03:39:24,641 --> 03:39:27,010
the Indus Valley and he said,
uh,

4612
03:39:27,250 --> 03:39:30,640
this will bring you into the presence of
Christ,

4613
03:39:31,150 --> 03:39:34,130
but you have to leave better

4614
03:39:34,130 --> 03:39:36,990
to become Christ than to hang out with 
him.

4615
03:39:37,720 --> 03:39:39,150
He said,
which is.

4616
03:39:39,510 --> 03:39:40,151
Yeah,
yeah,

4617
03:39:40,151 --> 03:39:41,030
yeah.
That was his.

4618
03:39:41,240 --> 03:39:43,910
Because their premise was,
this is something like,

4619
03:39:43,911 --> 03:39:47,930
this is definitely a thing for sure.
But there could be that thing.

4620
03:39:47,960 --> 03:39:48,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

4621
03:39:48,801 --> 03:39:49,820
That's it.
That was the,

4622
03:39:50,030 --> 03:39:51,340
you can live there.
Yeah.

4623
03:39:51,380 --> 03:39:52,213
I think that we're entirely in prison 
divide a wall of ideas and of behavior 

4624
03:39:58,431 --> 03:39:59,264
and a momentum.
And of culture and of conditioning and 

4625
03:40:01,970 --> 03:40:05,120
the way we look at the world is like in 
these preprogram trunks,

4626
03:40:05,121 --> 03:40:05,954
that's a car that's a building we,
I don't think necessarily we see it for 

4627
03:40:09,531 --> 03:40:10,364
what it really completely is,
which is some very strange temporary 

4628
03:40:15,141 --> 03:40:19,280
life that no one has really defined the 
meaning of it.

4629
03:40:19,520 --> 03:40:20,353
We're,
we're in infinity hurling through space 

4630
03:40:23,510 --> 03:40:24,343
surrounding and giant nuclear explosion 
rocketing through the universe and all 

4631
03:40:28,311 --> 03:40:29,000
of that.
Trying to make,

4632
03:40:29,000 --> 03:40:29,833
make sense of it all,
and in between there you've got cops 

4633
03:40:31,431 --> 03:40:32,960
killing people in hallways.

4634
03:40:33,300 --> 03:40:35,550
You've got black lives matter,
you've got a.

4635
03:40:35,551 --> 03:40:36,384
you've got every single possible 
variation from furries to people that 

4636
03:40:41,600 --> 03:40:44,540
it's their job to ticket street vendors 
who don't have the right.

4637
03:40:45,830 --> 03:40:46,663
It'd be the whole thing is this entire 
thing that we're experiencing is really 

4638
03:40:51,081 --> 03:40:51,914
psychedelic.
If you weren't living life and if life 

4639
03:40:55,341 --> 03:40:56,174
made way more sense,
like in the world that we're normally 

4640
03:40:59,991 --> 03:41:00,824
accustomed to,
is much more controlled and two 

4641
03:41:03,201 --> 03:41:05,870
dimensional,
and you could see the world that we live

4642
03:41:05,871 --> 03:41:06,704
in for the very first time.
You'd be overwhelmed by how insane it 

4643
03:41:09,471 --> 03:41:10,304
is.
You'd be overwhelmed by the 

4644
03:41:11,271 --> 03:41:14,030
possibilities.
We'd be overwhelmed by the Internet.

4645
03:41:14,031 --> 03:41:14,864
You'd be overwhelmed by language.
You'd be overwhelmed by feelings and 

4646
03:41:16,821 --> 03:41:19,400
emotions and all of it.
If we weren't used to it,

4647
03:41:19,730 --> 03:41:21,050
all of it will be like,
whoa,

4648
03:41:21,051 --> 03:41:23,960
this is crazy.
Like nonverbal expression.

4649
03:41:24,020 --> 03:41:29,020
People Strip clubs for race cars,
all of it planes.

4650
03:41:29,640 --> 03:41:31,910
Why don't they have metal tubes?
They flying through the air,

4651
03:41:32,030 --> 03:41:34,490
the fuck.
We're just so used to all of it.

4652
03:41:34,700 --> 03:41:35,533
That life itself is very psychedelic.
It's just a psychedelic experience that 

4653
03:41:40,041 --> 03:41:40,874
we've grown deeply accustomed to and I 
think the psychedelic experience that 

4654
03:41:44,301 --> 03:41:45,950
you have when you're on a heavy duty 
thing,

4655
03:41:45,951 --> 03:41:46,784
like a dmt,
it's like you venture forth into a 

4656
03:41:50,031 --> 03:41:51,940
dimension that you don't have context 
for,

4657
03:41:52,370 --> 03:41:54,650
but you feel familiar.
You feel familiar with it,

4658
03:41:54,770 --> 03:41:55,603
but you don't have context for it.
It doesn't fit into your normal 

4659
03:41:57,441 --> 03:41:58,274
patterns,
but the normal patterns are just as 

4660
03:41:59,841 --> 03:42:00,830
bizarre.
Man.

4661
03:42:01,100 --> 03:42:01,933
The normal patterns were taking liquid.
How do these clear plastic things that 

4662
03:42:06,051 --> 03:42:06,884
are made out of oil that somehow the 
other they figured out to turn into a 

4663
03:42:10,340 --> 03:42:11,173
clear plastic.
Can we fill it up with liquids and you 

4664
03:42:13,311 --> 03:42:14,180
drink them?
The Chuck?

4665
03:42:14,181 --> 03:42:18,200
These things and you follow the path of 
this plastic bottle,

4666
03:42:18,290 --> 03:42:19,123
it might eventually wind up in some 
seagulls gut choking to death in the 

4667
03:42:22,970 --> 03:42:23,570
middle of the ocean.
You know,

4668
03:42:23,570 --> 03:42:25,710
I mean,
it's bizarre,

4669
03:42:25,820 --> 03:42:26,653
but then also add to that that you're 
melting into time to while you drink 

4670
03:42:29,781 --> 03:42:31,940
from the bottle,
you're just not.

4671
03:42:31,950 --> 03:42:32,040
The

4672
03:42:32,040 --> 03:42:32,873
insanity that is bottle is like your 
bottles mid process it somewhere from 

4673
03:42:37,350 --> 03:42:41,160
some batch of gooey shit to being a 
bottle to being in a seagulls.

4674
03:42:41,161 --> 03:42:41,994
Got You're mid process to honey,
you're getting funding getting 

4675
03:42:49,051 --> 03:42:50,640
dissolved,
you know what I mean?

4676
03:42:50,760 --> 03:42:51,593
You're mid process and and,
and like the sun and so is the fucking 

4677
03:42:55,081 --> 03:42:55,660
sun.
But you know,

4678
03:42:55,660 --> 03:42:56,493
the fun thing to do,
this is something that occurred to me 

4679
03:42:58,051 --> 03:42:58,884
when I was super high recently.
I was sitting in this fucking apartment 

4680
03:43:02,970 --> 03:43:05,580
and then suddenly it dawned on me like,
wait a minute,

4681
03:43:05,760 --> 03:43:07,470
how many other people are going to 
fucking live here?

4682
03:43:07,800 --> 03:43:08,910
And then I'm thinking like,
wait,

4683
03:43:08,911 --> 03:43:10,950
how many people have lived here?
And then I'm thinking,

4684
03:43:10,951 --> 03:43:11,784
how many conversations have happened in 
this fucking apartment where everybody 

4685
03:43:14,251 --> 03:43:16,200
thought these were really serious 
conversations.

4686
03:43:16,201 --> 03:43:16,621
Like,
Oh yeah,

4687
03:43:16,621 --> 03:43:18,420
we're really getting into it,
man,

4688
03:43:18,780 --> 03:43:20,160
and then you realize,
oh my God,

4689
03:43:20,161 --> 03:43:20,994
I'm just a little.

4690
03:43:21,100 --> 03:43:24,810
I'm just a little eddy of air spinning 
around in this fucking apartment.

4691
03:43:25,110 --> 03:43:27,960
I'm going to leave and there's going to 
be other little eddies of hair that spin

4692
03:43:27,961 --> 03:43:28,794
around in this apartment.
The apartment's going to be around way 

4693
03:43:31,351 --> 03:43:33,450
longer than any of those other eddies of
air.

4694
03:43:33,451 --> 03:43:35,670
So really just to add to what you're 
saying,

4695
03:43:35,671 --> 03:43:36,504
the beauty of the glorious nature of the
universe versus our ability to 

4696
03:43:40,321 --> 03:43:43,140
comprehend it is that we are so fucking 
impermanent.

4697
03:43:43,410 --> 03:43:48,300
We are so impermanent and we are so 
fluid and we're so melting into time.

4698
03:43:48,570 --> 03:43:49,403
It's a really amazing thing that will 
allow you and I and you say you say 

4699
03:43:52,411 --> 03:43:54,990
we're used to it and sometimes I think,
yeah,

4700
03:43:54,991 --> 03:43:57,090
that must be it,
but I think also there's a lot of eggs.

4701
03:43:57,120 --> 03:43:59,910
We're ignoring it.
We're numb to it.

4702
03:44:00,150 --> 03:44:02,510
It's too much.
Too overwhelmed.

4703
03:44:02,610 --> 03:44:05,190
Yes.
You think about hunter gatherers,

4704
03:44:05,400 --> 03:44:08,280
hunter gatherers lived in the world that
created them,

4705
03:44:08,730 --> 03:44:10,620
the world that they evolved in,
right?

4706
03:44:10,830 --> 03:44:11,663
So it's the same world.
Your father and grandfather and great 

4707
03:44:13,441 --> 03:44:15,360
grandfather.
Everybody lived in the same world,

4708
03:44:15,510 --> 03:44:17,490
so the skills you're born learning,

4709
03:44:17,750 --> 03:44:18,583
I grew up learning.
Those are the skills that are 

4710
03:44:19,251 --> 03:44:20,084
appropriate to your world where we're in
a world now where even people who are 

4711
03:44:25,431 --> 03:44:28,700
alive are in a different world than the 
one they were born into.

4712
03:44:29,190 --> 03:44:31,460
You know,
and where I grew up before the Internet,

4713
03:44:31,480 --> 03:44:32,510
right.
This is all new.

4714
03:44:32,870 --> 03:44:34,670
I was in my thirties when the shit 
started.

4715
03:44:34,730 --> 03:44:36,590
Yeah.
So nuts and.

4716
03:44:36,620 --> 03:44:38,870
But people,
younger people can't imagine what it was

4717
03:44:38,871 --> 03:44:41,520
like to travel before there was email.
Yeah.

4718
03:44:41,521 --> 03:44:44,060
So you were like 40 when the first 
iphone came out,

4719
03:44:44,061 --> 03:44:45,040
right?
I was born in [inaudible].

4720
03:44:45,041 --> 03:44:46,430
Sixty two.
Yeah.

4721
03:44:47,330 --> 03:44:48,163
So the whole thing is,
it's hard to imagine it being any 

4722
03:44:51,291 --> 03:44:52,124
different than it is,
but if you really just think of what it 

4723
03:44:55,461 --> 03:44:56,120
is,
I'll either,

4724
03:44:56,120 --> 03:44:56,953
just the discussions that we've had here
today about what the potential issues 

4725
03:45:00,381 --> 03:45:01,214
could be with ai,
with advancing technology that has not 

4726
03:45:04,131 --> 03:45:05,840
been mapped out.
It's not,

4727
03:45:05,900 --> 03:45:06,733
it's not going to be regulated as far as
how far innovation is allowed to 

4728
03:45:09,381 --> 03:45:10,490
continue.
It's not going.

4729
03:45:10,520 --> 03:45:11,353
They're going to.
They're going to be so far ahead of the 

4730
03:45:12,831 --> 03:45:15,070
people that understand the regulations.
Let's get that.

4731
03:45:15,170 --> 03:45:17,390
Things are going to be coming out like 
the Internet itself.

4732
03:45:17,450 --> 03:45:18,283
The Internet came out itself before they
really understood what the implications 

4733
03:45:20,361 --> 03:45:21,194
were.
If the government could go back in time 

4734
03:45:22,820 --> 03:45:23,870
and pull the fucking,
hey,

4735
03:45:23,871 --> 03:45:24,620
hey,
hey,

4736
03:45:24,620 --> 03:45:26,630
pop.
Let's talk about this first.

4737
03:45:26,750 --> 03:45:30,160
Pull that plug right out of the wall 
before the Internet on aol

4738
03:45:30,340 --> 03:45:33,940
and let's just talk about what we're 
going to do with this and let's,

4739
03:45:33,970 --> 03:45:36,340
let's manage this because let me show 
you what it could be,

4740
03:45:36,550 --> 03:45:40,090
and then you'd see 25 years later,
people like holding on their phones,

4741
03:45:40,091 --> 03:45:40,924
walking into traffic and getting hit by 
cars because they're so addicted to 

4742
03:45:43,601 --> 03:45:45,070
checking their facebook fan,
man.

4743
03:45:45,640 --> 03:45:46,473
Yeah,
it's nuts.

4744
03:45:46,810 --> 03:45:47,643
Yeah.
Imagine if a drug could do with cell 

4745
03:45:48,581 --> 03:45:49,414
phones.
Do imagine if a drug came along and the 

4746
03:45:51,281 --> 03:45:53,650
drug made you like stare at your hands 
all day,

4747
03:45:53,910 --> 03:45:55,900
that everybody was just like staring at 
their hands.

4748
03:45:56,680 --> 03:45:58,150
It means like praying.
Yeah.

4749
03:45:58,151 --> 03:45:58,984
The only.
The only thing difference is you are 

4750
03:46:00,131 --> 03:46:03,100
getting some information,
but I mean if there was a drug that came

4751
03:46:03,101 --> 03:46:06,730
along that made you want to stare at 
your hands like 90 percent of the day,

4752
03:46:07,010 --> 03:46:10,690
like if you're playing video games,
you're not getting any information.

4753
03:46:10,930 --> 03:46:13,070
That's true.
Porn.

4754
03:46:13,450 --> 03:46:16,600
Well they say the video games in some 
ways are good for the site though.

4755
03:46:16,810 --> 03:46:20,040
Good for the psyche.
They make it good for your mind.

4756
03:46:20,050 --> 03:46:21,250
Pilots.
Yeah.

4757
03:46:21,480 --> 03:46:21,910
That's,
you know,

4758
03:46:21,910 --> 03:46:22,743
it's not good for my psyche getting my 
fucking ass kicked at hearthstone where 

4759
03:46:25,341 --> 03:46:26,440
this new expansion.

4760
03:46:29,260 --> 03:46:32,050
But very quickly the thing you're 
talking about the um,

4761
03:46:32,530 --> 03:46:33,970
the uh,
the,

4762
03:46:34,040 --> 03:46:37,030
the concept of a drug that makes you 
stare at your hands.

4763
03:46:37,990 --> 03:46:42,990
I think our thoughts at one point like 
the ability to think the way we do was a

4764
03:46:43,181 --> 03:46:45,280
new technology.
It started emerging.

4765
03:46:45,281 --> 03:46:47,410
And so like when you're caught up in 
your thoughts,

4766
03:46:48,100 --> 03:46:51,040
what's the difference between that and 
looking at your fucking cell phone?

4767
03:46:51,280 --> 03:46:53,920
Like when you get obsessed with your 
thoughts and like,

4768
03:46:53,980 --> 03:46:57,580
cause I've noticed like whenever I get 
really caught up in a flurry of thoughts

4769
03:46:57,790 --> 03:46:58,623
and I allow myself to really get lost in
the thing you're talking about the 

4770
03:47:00,971 --> 03:47:03,100
simulation,
the projection into the future.

4771
03:47:03,370 --> 03:47:04,203
You're 17 fights ahead with this person 
because they said this thing that 

4772
03:47:07,211 --> 03:47:10,840
they're never going to say.
I think that's a form of looking at your

4773
03:47:10,841 --> 03:47:11,674
cell phone only.
It's the internal simulator inside the 

4774
03:47:13,991 --> 03:47:14,824
neuro computer that your brain is,
but I don't think it's too much 

4775
03:47:17,381 --> 03:47:18,040
different.

4776
03:47:18,040 --> 03:47:18,873
I think both of these things are just 
different attempts to try to evade the 

4777
03:47:22,691 --> 03:47:23,524
present moment because the present 
moment is so overwhelmingly 

4778
03:47:26,681 --> 03:47:27,514
heartbreakingly beautiful that we'd 
rather have our faces buried in our 

4779
03:47:30,461 --> 03:47:31,294
phones or in our thoughts.
I think that's the problem is the more 

4780
03:47:33,941 --> 03:47:36,610
that we get into the moment,
it's fucking amazing here.

4781
03:47:36,640 --> 03:47:38,470
It is amazing,
but I don't think that's what's.

4782
03:47:38,650 --> 03:47:39,483
I don't think it's the fact that it's 
beautiful that's making people be 

4783
03:47:41,891 --> 03:47:42,724
distracted.
I think overwhelming the amount of data 

4784
03:47:45,671 --> 03:47:48,340
that's coming our way and I don't think 
we're designed for it.

4785
03:47:48,341 --> 03:47:50,380
I think that's one of the things that 
gets people at peace.

4786
03:47:50,381 --> 03:47:54,010
If you're on a hike in nature,
this is all stuff where your brain has a

4787
03:47:54,011 --> 03:47:55,780
whole fort.
We're talking about keys,

4788
03:47:56,190 --> 03:47:59,130
keys at slots.
Those key is just fit in.

4789
03:47:59,140 --> 03:48:00,490
There's a tree,
there's the bird,

4790
03:48:00,510 --> 03:48:02,170
all of that eagle.
Holy Shit.

4791
03:48:02,171 --> 03:48:02,621
Wow.
Look,

4792
03:48:02,621 --> 03:48:05,320
the salmon jumping,
that's there's keys for that.

4793
03:48:05,350 --> 03:48:06,183
There's receptors for all that stuff.
When you're walking down fucking Santa 

4794
03:48:11,050 --> 03:48:11,883
Monica Boulevard and his people honking 
their horn and different music is 

4795
03:48:13,571 --> 03:48:14,404
playing in different cars and there's 
smells that aren't natural and there's 

4796
03:48:18,221 --> 03:48:19,054
so much data coming your way.
It's overwhelming and then you're 

4797
03:48:21,161 --> 03:48:24,730
thinking about your work and your job 
and your boss keeps giving you massages.

4798
03:48:25,600 --> 03:48:27,050
Creepy.
You know?

4799
03:48:27,330 --> 03:48:28,730
You just want to.

4800
03:48:29,120 --> 03:48:33,060
When it gets back to that natural,
unnatural conversation we began with,

4801
03:48:33,070 --> 03:48:34,890
right?
Because you know you're.

4802
03:48:35,420 --> 03:48:36,253
You're describing the metaphor of 
receptor cells or something for these 

4803
03:48:38,601 --> 03:48:39,434
different inputs,
but another way to look at it is your 

4804
03:48:41,661 --> 03:48:44,270
body has expectations,
right?

4805
03:48:44,271 --> 03:48:45,104
Your eyes are designed with an 
expectation of certain wavelengths of 

4806
03:48:49,911 --> 03:48:53,840
light that are relevant to this animal,
right?

4807
03:48:53,841 --> 03:48:54,674
Those are like the reds of the berries 
are relevant because now they're ripe 

4808
03:48:57,021 --> 03:48:59,990
and you know there are different than 
blood is shocking and all that.

4809
03:49:00,530 --> 03:49:01,363
The ears are expectations of certain 
decibel levels that would be important 

4810
03:49:04,791 --> 03:49:07,860
for this animal to hear.
Rabbits I've totally different setup,

4811
03:49:07,861 --> 03:49:09,650
you know,
so your whole body,

4812
03:49:09,651 --> 03:49:12,560
your lungs or an expectation of oxygen,
rich air,

4813
03:49:12,561 --> 03:49:15,950
you know everything.
And when you take that animal out,

4814
03:49:16,370 --> 03:49:20,060
it's confused because what it's 
expecting isn't there.

4815
03:49:20,240 --> 03:49:22,650
So it's not just metaphorical,
it's,

4816
03:49:22,651 --> 03:49:23,484
it's actually physiologically we're 
living in a world that our bodies don't 

4817
03:49:26,631 --> 03:49:27,770
expect.
Hmm.

4818
03:49:28,150 --> 03:49:28,983
God Damn.
What a great way to end this thing 

4819
03:49:31,390 --> 03:49:33,820
sitting for five hours.
This was fun.

4820
03:49:34,030 --> 03:49:36,250
Jesus Christ.
Thank you guys.

4821
03:49:36,251 --> 03:49:38,120
Let's do this more often.
Make these easy.

4822
03:49:38,121 --> 03:49:41,330
We can all just will triple cast it.
You want to do that while three?

4823
03:49:41,510 --> 03:49:42,880
Put it out,
put it.

4824
03:49:42,890 --> 03:49:43,910
We'll do that.
Whatever time.

4825
03:49:44,300 --> 03:49:46,810
I think that's probably the best way to 
do it all the time.

4826
03:49:47,220 --> 03:49:48,053
Yeah.
Yeah.

4827
03:49:48,140 --> 03:49:51,170
So that way nobody has to miss any of 
them or not subscribed.

4828
03:49:51,200 --> 03:49:53,240
And um,
you guys are both here.

4829
03:49:53,241 --> 03:49:55,630
Now you're here,
you're moving back.

4830
03:49:55,631 --> 03:49:57,350
I'm back,
you're done and you're here.

4831
03:49:57,640 --> 03:50:02,640
So unless I get kidnapped and Peru and a
little bit more often,

4832
03:50:03,440 --> 03:50:04,273
there's some of my favorite podcast ever
that Chris Ryan on twitter and the 

4833
03:50:09,010 --> 03:50:09,890
instagram.
Same.

4834
03:50:10,070 --> 03:50:12,360
Same beckers and Duncan trussell and 
everything.

4835
03:50:12,390 --> 03:50:14,290
I can trust them.
Alright fuckers.

4836
03:50:14,330 --> 03:50:15,470
Thank you.
Bye.
