1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,220
And we're live.
All right,

2
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:09,540
Shawn,
welcome aboard man.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,500
Thank you.
Thanks for doing this.

4
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:11,760
Appreciate it.
Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,920
Joe.
You are one of those guys that,

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,340
uh,
that came up so many times on twitter.

7
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:19,200
I had to reach out to you.
So many people were like,

8
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,700
have you checked out what this guy's
doing?

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,520
He's eating nothing but meat and he's a
doctor.

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,440
He's super healthy.
I was like,

11
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:26,910
okay,
let me check out what this guy's doing.

12
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:30,090
And then I saw you and I was like,
he's serious about this.

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,051
And I was like,
okay,

14
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:35,160
this isn't a gimmick.
You're actually an educated guy and um,

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,130
you,
you are pursuing this carnivore diet.

16
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,361
Yeah.
I mean it's,

17
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:40,410
you know,
if you were to ask,

18
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,870
pull this thing up close to you,
if you could let you go,

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,140
if you would've asked me two years ago,
I would've said,

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,310
that's fucking crazy.

21
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:47,910
I mean,
yeah,

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,960
I mean,
it's what I to say,

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,990
you know,
if you'd asked me even five years ago,

24
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:52,650
I'd say,
yeah,

25
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,720
die doesn't really matter that much.
Just training your ass off.

26
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,570
Because I had been an athlete is
training my whole life.

27
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,250
And you know,
I didn't really until I got in my mid

28
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:01,980
forties and then all of a sudden I was
like crap,

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,810
trading ain't working.
I'm just getting fat.

30
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:04,561
I'm getting,
you know,

31
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:05,880
high blood pressure,
you know,

32
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:08,160
probably pre diabetic and they're not,
you know that I went down this,

33
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,400
you know,
there's dietary journey where I went

34
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:16,401
from doing the low fat,
low calorie fish and vegetables,

35
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:19,950
almost vegetarian training three day,
three times a day,

36
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,620
just about trying to try and get lean.
And then I went down to,

37
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,701
you know,
then I was like,

38
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:25,050
man this sucks.
I'm miserable.

39
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,010
I can't,
can't,

40
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,390
can't maintain this,
you know.

41
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,170
Then I went on the Paleo Diet.
You started looking,

42
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:30,601
I was like,
man,

43
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:33,570
Bacon looks pretty good.
And then I went and I started reading

44
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:36,570
some more and then I went on to a low
carb,

45
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:38,850
high fat.
And then I did ketogenic for about two,

46
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:40,500
three years.
Cause I think you do stuff like that

47
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,020
dude.
And then I just started reading about

48
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:45,930
these people that do this cardboard dot.
And then I want to sort of reading,

49
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,310
did you read about it?
Well,

50
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:48,810
there's,
there's actually a facebook group,

51
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,420
it's called zeroing in on health is
getting Charles' Washington,

52
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:54,330
he's been doing it about 10 years.
And so they've got about 10 thinks about

53
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:57,840
13,000 peoples right people.
So He's been exclusively on a

54
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:00,150
carnivorous diet for 10 years,
10 years.

55
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,490
So no vegetables,
no carbs,

56
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,600
no nothing.
Nope.

57
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,550
I mean he basically eats,
you know,

58
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,860
I think he ate steak and pork ribs and
stuff like that.

59
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,540
And there's another guy,
I mean it was more impressive.

60
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:12,090
There's a guy named Joel Anderson and
his wife Shawn,

61
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,370
they'd been doing it for 20 years and I,
you know,

62
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,680
I could probably show you a picture of
that guy,

63
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:19,560
but he,
I mean he's 60 and he looks like he's 30

64
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:22,740
his wife is in his mid forties and she
looks like she's 25 I mean there,

65
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,710
I mean why all by looking at these
people you're like,

66
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,090
they're crazy healthy.
You know,

67
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:30,840
what happened was she had lyme disease
real bad and was kind of overweight and

68
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:33,630
really sick and he started doing like
the same stuff loud when he's reading

69
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,310
about these olds cold bodybuilders,
you remember,

70
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:36,810
I don't know if we're ever going to
convince Kuranda.

71
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,120
So he promoted the steak and eggs diet
back in the 1950s sixties and he was

72
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,090
just jacked.
I mean he was,

73
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:44,340
he was like,
this is,

74
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:47,070
you know,
1956 he was kind of before most of the

75
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:48,870
steroid stuff was hitting,
you know,

76
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:50,490
I mean there were,
there were still some steroids back in

77
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,740
the 1940s you know,
they're Nazis play with that with the

78
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:53,100
truth.

79
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,930
But you know,
it didn't really get into the

80
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,360
bodybuilding culture till probably the
60s you know,

81
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,710
and in the 70s and not,
you know,

82
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,570
not to everywhere.
Right,

83
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,180
right.
But he was doing this stuff when he,

84
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,880
and if you look up,
if you look up Vince Garon de and look

85
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,240
at his physique from the 1940
[inaudible] 1950 he's fricking pretty

86
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,770
amazing.
And it's just eating meat.

87
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,800
He was eating his diet was basically,
I think it was five days of just eating

88
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,510
meat and eggs.
I was taking the eggs and then every,

89
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:19,690
every one day,
like every fifth or sixth day you could

90
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,230
eat,
you know,

91
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,390
whatever.
And so that's what,

92
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,870
that's what he did.
So that was his night.

93
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:25,880
So that's what he looked like back in 19
you know,

94
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,490
that's probably the fifties you know,
so.

95
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,280
So that's pretty decent for back then.
You know,

96
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,550
they jack,
well I mean for,

97
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,140
for our,
and for a nonsteroid guy,

98
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:35,920
I mean this is also taking into
consideration how little they really

99
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:37,570
knew about training back then,
right?

100
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,500
Oh yeah.
They didn't know.

101
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,240
I mean,
if you go back into history and I'm

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,210
moving to talk about that,
but then there was a guy named Larry

103
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,670
Scott who was like the first Mr Olympia
and he was another guy that was eating

104
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:47,530
just tons of meat,
you know,

105
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:51,130
four or five pounds of meat a day.
And he wanted us to an Olympian again,

106
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,540
you know,
there's some of their drug use,

107
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,590
you know,
in some of this stuff.

108
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:56,590
But I was just reading about this stuff
and I was just like,

109
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:56,860
well,
I'm,

110
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,700
you know,
I'm an athlete.

111
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:00,460
I like trying new stuff.
And so I said,

112
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,840
well,
I'm just going to try it for a month.

113
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,120
And so I did it for a month and I was
like,

114
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:05,170
man,
I feel pretty good,

115
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,101
right?
So I was like,

116
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:06,680
well,
I'm gonna,

117
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,260
I'm size like I did a month.
And I'm like,

118
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:09,910
well,
I'm gonna go back and go back to my

119
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,750
Kenogenic Diet.

120
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,210
And so I started wearing that day.
The day I did,

121
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,440
I was like,
I'm gonna eat some apples,

122
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,940
a little almond butter,
you know,

123
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,850
had some barriers and creamy and stuff
you'd be normally it is a treat and I

124
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:20,140
just didn't feel as good,
you know,

125
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:22,420
like my back started hurting a little
bit and I was like,

126
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,550
well,
maybe that's where someone had,

127
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,660
so then I went and said,
well,

128
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:26,950
I'm just going back to eating meat
again.

129
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,320
When your back started hurting from
eating apples.

130
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,161
Well,
I mean,

131
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:30,970
it was just like,
you know,

132
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,490
this is one of the things that I've seen
him,

133
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,340
and we can talk about this,
you know,

134
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,850
in detail,
but I've seen a lot of people what

135
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:38,050
they'll say is,
you know,

136
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,020
and this is what I saw when I was
working as a surgeon,

137
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,020
when I put people on a ketogenic diet,
their joint pain was starting to go

138
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:44,390
away.

139
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,730
Right?
So this is pretty common.

140
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,520
A lot of people believe that joint pain
is connected to the consumption of

141
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,420
simple carbohydrates.
Well,

142
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:50,951
I think,
yeah,

143
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:51,700
I think it's,
you know,

144
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,310
I find carbohydrates,
I don't know what it is for sure,

145
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:56,230
but it's something we eat and most like,
you know,

146
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:57,370
a lot of cases,
not always,

147
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:59,020
but I think there's something out there
we're eating.

148
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,480
I'm pretty convinced as not meat,
you know,

149
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:03,610
that's what I can tell you for sure.
From what I know,

150
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,200
you know,
whether it's,

151
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,130
uh,
you know,

152
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:07,160
sugar,
whether it's,

153
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,990
uh,
you know,

154
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,380
process gluten or wheat or stuff like
that,

155
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:13,420
whether it's vegetable oil,
uh,

156
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:14,620
whether it's,
uh,

157
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,750
you know,
or even some vegetables potentially.

158
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,610
And so this is what I'm seeing and this
is what I saw.

159
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,700
You know,
I studied these large facebook groups

160
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:22,840
like an anthropologist,
you know,

161
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:24,760
like they used to study these people,
you know,

162
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:25,980
a hundred years ago they'd go out,
you know,

163
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,910
western price,
we got and see all these people and

164
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,260
study their teeth and stuff.

165
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,750
The problem with that is,
you know,

166
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,080
you don't speak their language.
You know,

167
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,100
he was pretty remote.
You can't,

168
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,920
you've got to translate.
And so some of those observations,

169
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:36,850
you know,
while they're valid,

170
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,650
they're hard to do now,
you know,

171
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:41,640
but so when you go on these groups and
you just wa all even knew it,

172
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,690
just like reading this,
like a scientist going,

173
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,760
okay,
this guy went on this diet and has joint

174
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,441
pulling away.
And this guy,

175
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:49,810
one of those not in his thyroid disease
went away.

176
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:53,050
This guy went on this diet and his skin
got psoriasis,

177
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:54,850
want to go.
And I kept seeing this over and over and

178
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:56,800
over and over again.
I mean thousands of them.

179
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,130
But the big thing for most

180
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,340
people is removing refined
carbohydrates,

181
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:03,800
removing sugar.
And a lot of people

182
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,850
dairy.
Yeah.

183
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:07,490
I would say that that's a good strategy
for most people.

184
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,324
You know,
here's the deal.

185
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,460
I don't care what people or you didn't
eat,

186
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,690
whatever makes you healthy.
You know,

187
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:13,880
I think this is a thing.
We had these national guidelines that

188
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,280
tell people what to eat,
but there they don't work for most

189
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:16,851
people.
You know,

190
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:17,500
obviously,
I mean,

191
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,590
we're looking at it,
look at our country.

192
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:20,600
I mean it's just,
it's sad to see all these people that

193
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:21,620
are,
you know,

194
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,700
really,
really getting sick.

195
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:24,440
And so I think,
you know,

196
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,420
there's a guy named Vinnie toward her
two has this no sugar,

197
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,560
no grains.
I think that will,

198
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:31,370
that will successfully help a huge
percentage of people,

199
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,050
you know?
But I think you have to be objective

200
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:35,370
about it.
You have to do it long enough for town

201
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:36,290
and effect.
And you know,

202
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,510
I think you have to,
um,

203
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,461
you know,
being,

204
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:40,010
be really cool.

205
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,130
It'd be really clinical about it.
And so one of the big problems that I

206
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:45,260
see as a physician,
and this is a big problem because people

207
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:49,190
will go on a low carb diet or ketogenic
diet and they'll say,

208
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,380
I feel the best I've ever felt in my
life.

209
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,330
I mean,
my mood is better,

210
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,520
my,
my mental cognition is better,

211
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,040
my joints feel better,
my guts don't hurt,

212
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,200
my skin is better,
my sex drive is better.

213
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,320
Everything you would say is that means
you're getting healthy and they'll go to

214
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:07,460
their doctor and they'll get some blood
drawn and their cholesterol be high and

215
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,780
the doctor will say,
well,

216
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:10,520
you're going to kill yourself.
You're going to have a heart attack.

217
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,500
Right?
So people get scared away from that and

218
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,940
then go back to eating their other stuff
and they get,

219
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:15,230
then they feel crappy again.
But they're like,

220
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,490
well,
at least my cholesterol is not bad.

221
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,300
So one of the big problems,
and I'm trying to sort of basically

222
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:23,390
preaching this stuff is I think,
and this is a problem with health care

223
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,630
in general,
is we have so gotten away from just

224
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:27,970
defining what's healthy.
You know,

225
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,270
if somebody comes into your office and
you say you meet,

226
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,900
you talk to him for two,
three minutes because health healthcare

227
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:35,480
is just,
you got 10 minutes to see a patient make

228
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:36,950
a decision.
So what you're gonna do is like,

229
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,993
hi,
how you doing?

230
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,060
Order a bunch of labs.
You look at the results of the labs and

231
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,380
say,
okay,

232
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:43,760
this lab's low,
the slab is high,

233
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,180
the slabs normal.
Go on this drug or you know,

234
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:48,160
do this or that.
And,

235
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:49,550
and in,
in the patient may be saying why,

236
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,830
but I feel great.
Or the,

237
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,190
or maybe converse,
they may say,

238
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:53,450
I feel like crap.
Well,

239
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,470
you look at your labs,
look fine.

240
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:55,890
So go exercise a little bit.
So let me

241
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,740
back to the beginning.
So you,

242
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,210
you're,
you're a physician,

243
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:01,100
right?
So you understand a lot about the human

244
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:04,340
body,
double you worried when decided to go on

245
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:06,620
this carnivore only diet.
Well,

246
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:09,620
you worried that you were going to be
deficient in some sort of nutrients and

247
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,870
vitamins and fiber and all these
different things.

248
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:13,640
Like where were you cautious?

249
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,490
Yeah,
I mean,

250
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,710
I,
I was very,

251
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,850
uh,
very,

252
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,590
I'm still skeptical.
I mean,

253
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,270
I mean that's just the way he should be.
But I mean,

254
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:21,104
I was,
uh,

255
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,360
we're aware of what's not in me.
You know,

256
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,700
if you look at the Rda,
if you look at the already in it says

257
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:29,720
meet as low in vitamin C,
it's low and manganese,

258
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:32,390
it's low and you know,
a potassium,

259
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:34,940
it's low and you don't vitamin a.
But I mean there's a whole bunch of

260
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:36,050
things.
It's low and you know,

261
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:36,920
on paper,
right.

262
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,480
So I was like,
well,

263
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:40,220
I don't,
I can't rectify,

264
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:42,410
why are these people are doing so well?
You know,

265
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:45,500
just eating meat and we know
historically that tear their populations

266
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:49,340
out there in the inner what the Messiah,
the Sammy and all these people,

267
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,090
you know,
and the,

268
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,260
anyway,
it's probably the best exam,

269
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,380
but

270
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,850
right.
Because they had extremely low incidence

271
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:56,130
of cancer and no,
there's nothing up

272
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,740
there.
Yeah.

273
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,241
I mean,
I mean,

274
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,320
you know,
if you go to,

275
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,630
you know,
if you go to northern Alaska in the

276
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,310
winter time,
good luck trying to find a fruit or

277
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:04,770
vegetable or not.
And so,

278
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,300
but what people would say,
well they would,

279
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:07,410
they would just,
they would just fly.

280
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:09,210
So yeah,
but they had a lot of their organs and I

281
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:11,340
guess the vitamin C from their liver and
you know,

282
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:13,670
some of the,
some of the whale skin handsome.

283
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,870
And so they would just try to justify
that and try and make,

284
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:18,340
this is how it worked.
And then the same thing as messiah.

285
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,860
And they would say,
well sometimes they would eat some

286
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:22,050
berries once in a while.
So they would always try to justify it.

287
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:23,340
I'm like,
you know,

288
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:24,660
those things aren't available year
round.

289
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,100
So you know,
you can't get berries,

290
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,240
you know,
especially in Alaska or wherever the

291
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:29,700
anyone are.

292
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,450
You know,
you can't,

293
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,030
you can't get that 12 months out of
year.

294
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,240
That's not what's having a significant
impact on their diet.

295
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,270
I don't think it's coming from the meat
itself.

296
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,961
Well,
this was,

297
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:41,040
this is what,
this is what I,

298
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,690
after doing a lot of research on this
stuff.

299
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,120
So we've known,
so it's interesting.

300
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:47,720
So when we look at the development of
the Rdh,

301
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,260
you know,
the recommended daily allowance is those

302
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,930
were divine,
those were developed back in the 1940s

303
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,750
and they were developed basically for
soldiers to figure out what the heck are

304
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:56,610
you supposed to feed people so they can
survive.

305
00:09:56,611 --> 00:10:00,240
And so they did research on this and
what they did was they take populations

306
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:02,610
of people that are consuming a normal
diet.

307
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,320
Like you know,
back in the 1940s you know,

308
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:06,750
people would eat a mixture.
Everything was fairly high in

309
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:08,430
carbohydrate,
not as high as it is now,

310
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:10,530
by the way,
but it was a mixed diet.

311
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,060
And so what they see is,
you know,

312
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,510
if you eat that diet and you're
deficient in this nutrient,

313
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:16,980
if you don't get x amount of this
nutrient,

314
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,380
you're going to develop some sort of
nutrient deficiency syndrome.

315
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:21,091
And so they said,
okay,

316
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:24,990
well we know that this level of nutrient
deficiency causes disease,

317
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,670
so therefore we're going to recommend
this.

318
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,440
You know,
everybody gets this amount,

319
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,120
right?
So,

320
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:33,110
but they knew what they found out back
even at 1897,

321
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:35,280
there's a study where they're looking at
animals and they looked at something

322
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,980
called firemen.
They didn't know it was time and back

323
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:39,900
then,
but they saw that certain animals,

324
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:43,050
if they're on a lower carb diet,
they didn't get this disease.

325
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,380
We're animals on a high cart
carbohydrate dig this disease.

326
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:49,530
And the disease was called Berry Berry.
And so that's a thiamine deficiency,

327
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:53,310
which causes neurologic problems or um,
uh,

328
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,810
congestive heart failure type problems.

329
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,120
And so they were noticing that these
animals are on a low carb diet,

330
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,650
even though the thymine levels were
really,

331
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:01,140
really low,
they weren't getting diseases.

332
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,960
So if you look at that and you look at
all these other nutrients,

333
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:05,790
you know,
things like manganese,

334
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,900
manganese is highly,
uh,

335
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,830
required for carbohydrate metabolism.
And so if you're on a diet where you're

336
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:16,740
not taking any carbohydrate,
all of a sudden you've got to say,

337
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,560
maybe I don't need as much manganese.
And despite what the RDA says,

338
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,110
and you can look at that for nutrient
after nutrient glucose and vitamin sees

339
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,230
a huge one,
right?

340
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,420
So vitamin C,
you don't,

341
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,270
you don't take vitamin C and you get
really,

342
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:31,980
really need to get scurvy and you get
sick.

343
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:33,900
You die is it will kill you.
I mean,

344
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,060
you end up with bleeding in your joints,
your teeth fall out,

345
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,070
your gums rot,
your skin opens up with sores,

346
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:38,910
horrible disease.

347
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,020
And these people are not getting scurvy.
And so what's happening is we know that

348
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,100
a molecule of glucose and a molecule of
vitamin C are almost identical.

349
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,830
And so they compete for the same
transporters.

350
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,900
And so if you don't have a lot of
glucose floating around,

351
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,010
you need way,
way less vitamin C.

352
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,900
Really?
Yeah.

353
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,833
So there's,
there's some,

354
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,850
and this has been known for for quite a
while as well.

355
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,540
So,
well that's fascinating because

356
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,920
obviously orange juice,
tons of glucose,

357
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,150
tons of vitamin say.
Yeah.

358
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:05,020
Right.
Database account,

359
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,990
cancel each other out.
So I think what's happening,

360
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:10,360
and this is one of the things I think
potentially it just needs to be

361
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:13,600
investigated,
but I think that a lot of people that we

362
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:16,060
have all these vitamin deficiency,
vitamin D deficiency,

363
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,140
magnesium deficiency,
a lot of that may be caused by just

364
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:22,020
ingesting too much carbohydrate and
creating it,

365
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:23,950
creating a higher than normal need.

366
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,220
So basically we're,
we're creating higher needs for

367
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:28,150
vitamins.
Now.

368
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,160
You do blood work on yourself.
I haven't,

369
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:31,030
you know,
I haven't yet.

370
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:32,450
I'm gonna probably do it once I get,
you know,

371
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,820
I'm,
I'm a year at this.

372
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,100
You haven't done any?
No,

373
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:36,521
I don't.
You know,

374
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:37,190
here's the deal.
Do,

375
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,890
I mean I've got a lot of people to do it
all the time.

376
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,050
I'm not that interested in it because I
just don't,

377
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,300
I don't think it makes that big of a
difference from me.

378
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:45,880
I'll do it just out of,
just to satisfy other people's

379
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:48,970
curiosity.
I don't really have that much curiosity

380
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:49,680
personally

381
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,570
about your blood work.
I would not really radical change in

382
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:55,550
your diet where you're just consuming
only meat.

383
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,020
I would,
I would want to see what kind of results

384
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:57,490
I'm getting.

385
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,240
Well,
I mean it,

386
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,110
I mean it depends,
you know,

387
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,380
if you can tell me what blood tests
tells me I'm healthy and I don't think

388
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,500
you can't.
Well I think if you get a really good,

389
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:04,540
yeah,

390
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,980
doctor who understands the different
genes,

391
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:11,010
hdl cholesterol and ldl cholesterol and
free testosterone available and all the

392
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,760
different nutrients that are essential.
And if you get someone who really

393
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:19,390
understands that and kind of a
comprehensive examination of your blood

394
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:21,580
work,
I think he could benefit from it

395
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,140
greatly.
But also the,

396
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,650
the knowledge that you can tell them
like,

397
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:28,030
how do you feel?
I feel great.

398
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,650
You know,
and they can get a look at this.

399
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,570
What are you eating and what kind of
media you eating?

400
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:32,404
Where are you getting in it?

401
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah.
So that's an interesting point cause I,

402
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,360
you know,
we've started this,

403
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,201
you know,
you know,

404
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:37,230
and again,
I was new,

405
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:39,800
I started doing this and got public on
it and twitter and a lot of people were

406
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:40,281
saying,
well,

407
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:41,114
yeah,
you're,

408
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,560
you know,
you're doing well.

409
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:43,011
You're,
you know,

410
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:44,840
I'm breaking some more records and stuff
like that.

411
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,920
So let's put,
explain that.

412
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:47,470
Like what raw world records he,
Bryce,

413
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:48,410
so on the,
you know,

414
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,320
so I've been in,
yes.

415
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,260
So I've been an athlete my whole life
taught me and I've,

416
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:53,510
I've done,
it was like an athlete look pretty

417
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:54,020
stellar.
I mean,

418
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,880
you know,
I'm about to 40 right now,

419
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:56,960
but I mean I was,
you know,

420
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,600
so when I was,
when I was younger I played rugby in New

421
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,780
Zealand.
I was playing with some of the all

422
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:01,510
blacks,
you know,

423
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,660
at a high level.
This is before it was professional in

424
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:04,760
the name of the team by the way.

425
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,150
No,
it's not a race plane with blacks.

426
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:09,860
Is that what he's saying?
There's Zealand all blacks.

427
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,800
Do you want to know the history on it?
And it's kind of an interesting sort of

428
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:13,521
thing.
So back,

429
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:15,380
you know,
back in the 19 hundreds of New Zealand

430
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,350
guys were so fast and there's forwards
and backs,

431
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:21,660
fours elect the lineman in the backs of
the fast guys and they,

432
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,420
they were all so super fit.
And so they said they looked like they

433
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:27,890
were all backs,
but somebody type made a typo.

434
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,480
So that's what I'm,
that's interesting.

435
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,470
But they're,
they're like the best rugby players in

436
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,921
the world.
You know,

437
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:35,300
some people say South Africa is pretty
good,

438
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:38,300
but New Zealand is pretty much the best.
So I played down there with those guys

439
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:41,780
and then I went into weight,
powerlifting and I had an American

440
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:44,580
record in the deadlift.
I was deadlifting close to 800 pounds is

441
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,460
drug free athlete back in the 30s and
then I went on to 'em,

442
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,640
I just am strongman stuff for a few and
then I went on to throwing,

443
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,630
you know,
like track and field,

444
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:56,030
like discus and shot put and then the
highland games where you,

445
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,670
you know,
you run around with a big caber and wear

446
00:14:58,671 --> 00:14:59,090
a kilt.

447
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,560
And I won the world championships in
that.

448
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:04,160
And then you know what I got in my mid
40 [inaudible] I was about close to 300

449
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:06,890
pounds back then I was about to 80 to 85
and I was like,

450
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:09,850
man,
I just can't keep me doing this side.

451
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:11,150
So that's when I started dieting and
stuff.

452
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:15,500
And so I got down to pretty lean about
two 40 ish or I'm at now.

453
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,390
And I started doing is indoor rowing
stuff,

454
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:18,830
which is not a concept too.
So you remember,

455
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,570
I don't know,
you know conor mcgregor on is,

456
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,860
I don't remember that machine he was
rolling on.

457
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,250
I mean I'm sure in a lot of the Mam
showing guys know that.

458
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:28,010
So I got on there and I started training
for that.

459
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,310
And so what I did was there's a 500
meter row,

460
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,811
which is,
you know,

461
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:34,100
and this is kind of itching because it's
highly,

462
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:34,940
highly glycolytic.

463
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,170
I mean it's,
it's like,

464
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,770
it's not like running a marathon,
like exact pitter explaining glycolytic.

465
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,870
So glycolytic means you're burning
glucose,

466
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,370
you know,
you're using muscle glycogen,

467
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,091
you know,
I know he had,

468
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:46,560
who's a fell on a couple of weeks ago.
No,

469
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,080
it was,
the other guy was Andy Galpin.

470
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,940
Yeah.
He was saying all you got to have

471
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:50,990
glycogen.
And I'm like,

472
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,290
well to do highly glycolytic activity.
And so this is a highly,

473
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,370
highly glycolytic activity.
Takes about a minute,

474
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,120
a minute,
a minute to minute 30 and that's,

475
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,200
that's intense.
You know,

476
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:01,550
like you're going all out.
Right.

477
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,510
And so I was able to break the war,
the 50 plus world record in that.

478
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:08,200
And it was when I went Olin,
when it was uh,

479
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,120
when I got to 50,
it was one minute,

480
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:14,090
18.3 seconds.
And so I put it down all the way down

481
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:17,990
and one 14 so it took four seconds off
the world record without a single gram

482
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:18,710
of carbohydrate.

483
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,540
Totally.
I mean,

484
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,200
but doesn't,
when you mean this is the,

485
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:23,690
one of the issues with the ketogenic
diet,

486
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,170
if you eat too much protein,
your body converts that Protein Back to

487
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:28,850
glucose.
That's one of the things that they were

488
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:30,830
saying that you have to have like the,
you,

489
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:34,130
you're supposed to have like somewhere
in the neighborhood of 70% fats,

490
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,200
30% proteins,
right.

491
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:38,530
So this is a,
this is another sort of thing that I

492
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,390
think a lot of people sort of have,
have questions about.

493
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,850
One of the things we know about
Gluconeogenesis,

494
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:48,710
so that's converting protein or fat into
glucose is it's demand driven.

495
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,950
So your body doesn't just make it.
So if you get a lot of protein,

496
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:54,200
it doesn't just say,
I'm just going to make a bunch of blood

497
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:55,900
sugar for the heck of it because your
body doesn't need it.

498
00:16:55,901 --> 00:17:00,770
And so one of the things that glucose is
extremely important to the body.

499
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,760
I mean,
we need it.

500
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,760
I mean it's absolute.
So the nice thing about it is if you

501
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:07,490
regulate it really,
really well and the best way to regulate

502
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:08,121
it really,
really well,

503
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:10,430
it's just to make your own.
So rather than,

504
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,920
you know,
getting it from Kombucha or you know,

505
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,620
eating a bunch of carbs,
you know,

506
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:16,071
we're,
we're,

507
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:18,710
we're going to be all over the place.
So this is what happens.

508
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:19,900
So,
so ketosis,

509
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,410
again,
I probably spend significant periods of

510
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,930
time in Ketosis,
but I'm not always in Ketosis.

511
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:28,280
And that's not the point of this,
you know?

512
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,220
But I mean,
I think it ptosis is probably a good

513
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:31,791
thing,
you know,

514
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:32,840
periodically.
But I don't,

515
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:33,441
you know,
like I said,

516
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:34,850
I don't think,
you know,

517
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:36,020
we,
we can talk about evolutionary,

518
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,500
excuse me for interrupting you,
but why would it vary if your diet's not

519
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:40,334
varying?

520
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,880
Why would you be in Ketosis or out of
Ketosis if you're not varying your diet?

521
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,320
It just eating only meat.
Right?

522
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:46,520
So,
you know,

523
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,380
because it depends on how long I go
between meals.

524
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,110
Oh self,
I'm not intermittent fast,

525
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:53,980
so I intermittent feast.
So,

526
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,670
so this is what I think is,
you know,

527
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:59,250
I think this is probably more pri.
I will often go,

528
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,620
well,
here's the funny,

529
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,560
you know,
so I was in Denver,

530
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,540
a couple nice guy.
I went to the big Brazilian,

531
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,820
you know,
get down all you can eat meat place and

532
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:07,990
I just to Haas Korea.
Yeah.

533
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,840
Yeah.
I just picked up.

534
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,810
So I went there and I just,
I had him come back 50 times.

535
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,240
Wow.
Like I clicked everyone,

536
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:19,000
I said 50 frigging orders of food I had
to pay was about six pounds of meat and

537
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,190
hundred putting away in one setting.

538
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,760
You ate six pounds of me.
That's insane,

539
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:24,410
dude.
Yeah.

540
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,070
Yeah.
So I would,

541
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,280
so I put away about six pounds and then
I'm not hungry for like 30 some hours.

542
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,800
So I'm basically,
it's not that I'm intentionally,

543
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:34,620
fasting is just,
I've faced it so much that I just don't

544
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:36,330
feel like eating.
So I think here's what I think,

545
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,220
Huh?
You know you haven't,

546
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:39,870
why do you think we have an appetite?
I mean,

547
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,240
what's the point of an appetite to tell
you when to eat,

548
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,040
right?
Right.

549
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,060
That's exactly right.
But if you're eating the crappy wrong

550
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:47,640
food,
you know your appetites all screwed up.

551
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:49,920
So one of the problems,
we have people eating the wrong food.

552
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,971
You know,
we have this,

553
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:53,280
all this process garbage.
It's full of calories,

554
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,310
sugar and crap,
but it doesn't have any nutrients in

555
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:57,540
there.
So every time you're hungry,

556
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,010
your body's saying,
give me more nutrition.

557
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,860
Well,
if all you do is pour garbage your body,

558
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:03,060
you're always going to be saying,
I'm hungry,

559
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,040
I'm hungry.
Plus the insulin spikes,

560
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:05,910
all that stuff.
I mean,

561
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,950
so you want to know insulin is not,
you know,

562
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:10,290
we need some insulin,
we need insulin for muscle growth.

563
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,280
It's,
it's a useful thing.

564
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,350
The goal of insulin is not zero.
You know,

565
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:14,580
that's what people,
you don't understand.

566
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:16,230
It's not,
we don't want our glucose to be zero.

567
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:19,560
We don't want our insulin to be zero,
but we don't want it always,

568
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:20,820
always,
always spiking.

569
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:21,930
And so,
you know,

570
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:24,240
when you eat a big meal of something
you're supposed to be eating.

571
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:27,300
And I'll argue that I think meets a
pretty damn good meal and we can argue,

572
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,830
we can talk about how it's completed,
not,

573
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,170
but,
um,

574
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,620
so when you do that,
you know,

575
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:34,650
you dislike the next time you're hungry,
it's time to eat.

576
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,100
Your body says I need some,
I need energy so you can get it from fat

577
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,110
when you eat meat.
But I also need structure.

578
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,530
And so by you know,
eating meat,

579
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,060
you know,
you're basically giving your body what

580
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:47,100
it's asking for.
And I think that works pretty well.

581
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,450
Whose phones them on?
That's very interesting because,

582
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,790
uh,
most people would say you should eat a

583
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,040
balanced diet.
Right?

584
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,530
Most people would say that in order to
be healthy,

585
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,780
you should consume certain amount of
fruits,

586
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:03,600
a certain amount of vegetables.
You should have some,

587
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,170
some whole grains,
you should eat some meat.

588
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,900
And if you come along and tell people
like,

589
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:12,270
this is what I'm doing,
I mean six pounds of meat and I don't

590
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:14,820
eat for 30 hours,
like this guy's out of his fucking mind.

591
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,571
Yeah,
I mean I agree.

592
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:16,970
I mean it sounds crazy,
you know,

593
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,540
2017 that's crazy.

594
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,410
It's crap.
I mean I can,

595
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,290
I can point to thousands and thousands
of people and doing it in an excellent

596
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,280
help,
which is interesting.

597
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,840
But I mean,
you know,

598
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,060
balanced diet is just a frigging cop
out.

599
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,740
I mean it's like,
I don't know what that fucking to tell

600
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:30,180
you.
So I'm gonna tell you the mom's diet and

601
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:33,660
I wish you had done some blood work so
you should get us some data.

602
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,300
I mean,
it seems like someone who's espousing

603
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,910
this diet,
like it'd be nice he had some hard data.

604
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,631
Yeah.
So I mean,

605
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:40,860
you know,
cause I didn't know I was going to do

606
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:41,780
this.
I just started doing it.

607
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:42,460
I'm like,
well I,

608
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,291
you know,
I've already done it,

609
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,340
so I'll,
I'll probably get some,

610
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:45,590
you know,
so what,

611
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,030
what did you just decide like,
hey man,

612
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,850
try this for a month and then just keep
going.

613
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,650
I've tried.
I said I'm going to try it for a month.

614
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,420
And I just felt so good.
I was like,

615
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:55,930
well and you've been on it for,
so I started last December,

616
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,220
so a year.
Wow.

617
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,180
So a whole eat you whole year of just
eating meat cause you gotta do some

618
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:02,014
blood work,
man.

619
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,100
Well I probably will.
I mean,

620
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:04,010
you know,
but the point is,

621
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:06,250
I'm looking at the point I'm making is,
well what is it going to tell me?

622
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,600
Here's the thing,
we don't know.

623
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,460
One of the things is,
you know,

624
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:11,470
I'll tell you a little probably,
cause I've seen hundreds of hundreds of

625
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,600
people who've already done blood work.
So I know what it's going to show

626
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:14,920
basically.
You know.

627
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:16,530
So I've gotten,
we've got this study going,

628
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,010
we've got all these people to submitting
blood work.

629
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,290
But the,
uh,

630
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,380
you know,
probably my hdl will go out and my

631
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:24,540
triglycerides will go down.

632
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,930
My blood sugar stabilized to a low level
by my,

633
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:30,290
uh,
inflammatory markers will be normal does

634
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,610
because I've seen lots and lots of other
people's blood work already.

635
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,530
So I know it's going to show my
cholesterol may be up or down.

636
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,090
And that's the,
and that's something that we had a lot

637
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:41,350
of people worried about that.
And I can talk about cholesterol and my

638
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:44,680
view is a pretty worthless marker,
you know,

639
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,610
by itself.
You know,

640
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:47,800
you have to take it into context.
And so there's a,

641
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,290
you know,
there's a couple people that are really,

642
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,310
really intelligent about cholesterol
that it really testing this source of,

643
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,160
one guy's name is Dave Feldman on
twitter.

644
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:59,530
His name is Dave Kido.
There's another guy named Ivor Cummins,

645
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:01,150
who's an Australian thinks both
engineers.

646
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:02,200
And so this was,
this is what happened.

647
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,930
This guy date,
he goes on a ketogenic diet.

648
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,970
He was cholesterol goes sky frigging
heights,

649
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:08,020
like 400 you know,
way,

650
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:08,740
way up there.

651
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,570
And his doctor is freaking out and he's
freaking out.

652
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,940
So he's like,
I don't understand this.

653
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,630
I mean I feel great.
Everything about me is just best health

654
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:19,330
ever felt my life.
So what he does is he starts drawing his

655
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:23,380
blood every single day.
He gets a blood test and what he finds

656
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:27,670
out is that his blood cholesterol is all
over the place.

657
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,440
One day it's 300 and next day it's 201
days,

658
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,820
three 50 in the next day.
And so what we,

659
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,020
when we go to the doctor every six
months or a year and they get a blood

660
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,710
cholesterol uson and well that's my
cholesterol.

661
00:22:36,711 --> 00:22:40,180
And it's always that way.
Well he found out that it's so variable.

662
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,000
They've actually known about this since
the 1950s but no one has been talking

663
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:45,550
about.
So what he figured out,

664
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:47,110
and he's a systems engineer and he's
engineered.

665
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:47,980
There's some smart guys.

666
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,650
I mean that's the one thing I,
I kind of talk about it,

667
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:54,160
just to get somebody as an md or phd
doesn't mean they know everything.

668
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:57,250
There's a lot of people that are
plumbers and whatever,

669
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,000
they don't have any formal training that
configure.

670
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,820
They're smart people and they can figure
this stuff out.

671
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,640
So he's in his,
he's an engineer,

672
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,820
real smart guy.
And so what he does,

673
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,710
he figures out the cholesterol is
basically all it is,

674
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,920
is it's traveling around in your blood
based on energy flux.

675
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,750
So how much,
so if you've eaten a lot,

676
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,120
so if you've eaten a whole bunch of food
and your fault,

677
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,720
your liver is saying,
I don't need to put out a bunch fat

678
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,350
cause you to burn fat as fuel and oil,
even if we're not in a kitty Jane died.

679
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,660
So what it does is it transports fat.

680
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,150
So when you're hungry,
you haven't eaten for a while.

681
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,670
Like you fasted for a blood test,
your liver says we need fat and misses

682
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,140
because we're low on energy.
And so it shoots out all this fat.

683
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,520
And what happens is cholesterol is
cruising around for a ride.

684
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,040
So it's just sitting there,
you know,

685
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,630
um,
you know,

686
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,520
as a passenger.
So depending on how much you eat and

687
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:47,180
when you've eaten,
it'll change your cholesterol.

688
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,310
And so it's not a very good marker.
I mean you can,

689
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,400
you can find studies that show for all
cause mortality.

690
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:54,290
Like if you're like you,
you and me on it,

691
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,370
cause you're,
you're the same age as I am.

692
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:56,330
I think you do it right.
Yeah.

693
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,550
We're both these.
So if we look at,

694
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,540
you know,
and again,

695
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,490
associational studies are not that
great,

696
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,070
but if you look at that and you say all
cause mortality,

697
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:05,360
if I'm,
am I going to die or not?

698
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,300
If your cholesterol is high,
you're less likely to die.

699
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,910
If your cholesterol is high,
you're less likely to get Parkinson's

700
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:12,620
disease.
If your cholesterol is high,

701
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:14,360
you're less likely to get a bunch of
cancers.

702
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,980
You know,
so it's like,

703
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,080
see you saying that though,
but most people hear this and they go,

704
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:18,531
Bubba,
Bubba,

705
00:24:18,531 --> 00:24:18,980
Bubba,
bubba.

706
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,600
If you have a cholesterol is high,
you got to get a heart attack.

707
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,840
Well,
here's the deal with the dye.

708
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,360
Yeah.
Here's what,

709
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,430
here's the deal of heart attack.
So,

710
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:24,870
and this is interesting because you
know,

711
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,670
vegetarian to Vegan,
I don't mean to pick on vegetarians

712
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,350
beings cause I know some great ones are
great people and I think,

713
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:32,510
you know,
there shouldn't be a war between us but

714
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,300
vegetarians and Vegans,
the number one killer of vegetarian

715
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:37,550
Vegan has heart disease.
I mean that's what kills him to,

716
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:38,480
it kills everybody.

717
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,990
So it's just like,
you know,

718
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,570
you know,
do you trade,

719
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:42,920
am I going to die of cancer?
Am I going to try it?

720
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:44,120
Die Of heart disease,
you know,

721
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:45,160
which,
which won't pick your poison.

722
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:50,161
Most people don't understand that the
sugar industry's hijacking of science in

723
00:24:51,381 --> 00:24:56,381
the 1950s the way they paid off those
scientists to literally false advertise

724
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,970
the idea that sugar is safe for you,
but that saturated fat and cholesterol

725
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:05,390
is what's causing all of these issues
with people and heart attacks to this

726
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,770
day.
People just sort of repeat that.

727
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,420
Like they think it's Gospel.
Yeah.

728
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:09,380
I mean it's in,
it is,

729
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:12,020
it's part of the,
it's part of the framework of society

730
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:12,730
now.
I mean it's like,

731
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,460
it was the push that got you to say,
I'm just gonna eat nothing but meat.

732
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,040
Was there anybody that you knew that was
doing it really well that you were

733
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:19,640
talking to?

734
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,380
Did you get some where,
like I said,

735
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:23,240
it was just reading about people online,
you know,

736
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,650
um,
you know,

737
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:25,470
there's a,
you know,

738
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,570
if there's a,
I'll tell you what,

739
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:29,270
if there's a guy named Joe Anderson on
twitter,

740
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,650
his handle is Joe Charlene 98 eight 88
98 or 98.

741
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,863
It's this guy,
you know,

742
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,560
it's just the guy.
He's been doing it for 20 years.

743
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:37,730
I'm just like,
this is pretty cool.

744
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,250
Like I said,
reading back on that stuff and then just

745
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:41,720
because I've been an athlete and I'm
like,

746
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:42,441
and I don't,
you know,

747
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,420
I've never taken drugs and stuff like
that and I was always like,

748
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,990
what can get me to the next level as far
as athletic complex cause I'm just a

749
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:49,250
really competitive guy.
I mean,

750
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:50,660
I just,
I just like to,

751
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:52,280
you know,
push myself and see what works.

752
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:55,970
I know a lot of savage people that eat
mostly meet my friend Cam hands.

753
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,260
It's almost all meat.
Yeah.

754
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,540
He occasionally eats like something
else,

755
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,570
but most of what he eats is meat.
My friend Jocko willink.

756
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,100
Yeah.
When he's tired he goes,

757
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:06,330
I need more steak.
He eats a neat,

758
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,840
I mean it's a,
it's a fricking health food.

759
00:26:07,841 --> 00:26:09,110
I totally is.
I mean,

760
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:12,020
and you know there's a guy named bobby
maximus who's a,

761
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,280
who's a fitness guy.
He was,

762
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,810
he,
I guess he was used to be an mma guy

763
00:26:14,811 --> 00:26:18,110
years ago or something like that.
But I know he did this steak every day

764
00:26:18,111 --> 00:26:20,400
thing.
And so if we look back into,

765
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,760
into history,
I mean there's all kinds of accounts of

766
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,690
people using meat as an athletic
performance enhancer.

767
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,710
You know,
back in the original Greek Olympics,

768
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,650
those guys knew that they had a lot of
meat to perform better.

769
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,540
You know,
the feeders out of London,

770
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,550
you know,
these guys with the guards for the

771
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,271
kings,
you know,

772
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:37,340
they gave them extra meat,
cause I know they would fight better.

773
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,541
The,
you know,

774
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:39,680
the Mongols,
you know,

775
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,910
they just decimated,
you know,

776
00:26:40,911 --> 00:26:43,650
all through Asia.
They basically just ate their horses and

777
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:44,150
their meat.

778
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,660
That's what they did.
And I traveled with that,

779
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:47,940
you know,
and so you've got all these historical

780
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,380
examples of people performing better,
you know,

781
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,330
of what they were.
Laborers,

782
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,330
they were known to have this incredible
work capacity and all that.

783
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:57,390
You know,
all they was seal maiden and reindeer

784
00:26:57,391 --> 00:26:58,410
and you know,
stuff like that.

785
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:01,890
So what's a typical diet for you?
Give me a normal day.

786
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:03,550
You wake up in the morning,
so I do,

787
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,890
well I'll tell you what to do it.
So today,

788
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:05,490
I mean,
you know,

789
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,460
eating wise,
some that,

790
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,000
you know,
general,

791
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,960
either one meal or two meals depending
on what my workout training's going to

792
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,640
be.
So this morning,

793
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:12,540
you know,
cause I knew I was coming up here.

794
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:13,670
I train early,
early morning.

795
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,730
Well it's fast.
You know,

796
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:15,840
I set a new record,
by the way,

797
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:19,740
in my personal record is doing that,
but I had a couple of New York strips,

798
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,190
so I had about two pounds,
two pounds of meat.

799
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,061
Well,
that's a snack,

800
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,170
ma'am.
Is that your phone man?

801
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,540
That keeps it keeping.
Might be,

802
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,310
might have your little thing on that.
I think I'll probably get notifications

803
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:30,650
from people saying,
hey bro,

804
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,760
you too,
Andrew,

805
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,710
let me turn it said,
man,

806
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,720
you look just like you.
So you had to New York strips today.

807
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,740
Yeah,
I mean that's,

808
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:41,580
you know,
pounds of meat.

809
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,050
You know,
it took me a while to build up to this

810
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:43,651
before,
you know,

811
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:45,030
like a pound of meat would be,
you know,

812
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:45,631
that'd be tough.
No,

813
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:48,840
I can,
I can put down four pounds at one time

814
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:50,460
with the people looking at you would go,
well,

815
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:54,480
he's the super lean.
Like obviously whatever you're eating,

816
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:57,660
your body's processing it really well
when you don't have a,

817
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,300
you don't have what someone would think
of as a steak eater.

818
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:01,830
Gut.
Like you tell a guy,

819
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,830
someone,
a guy eats two steaks a day and like,

820
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,850
oh,
it must have a gut.

821
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:11,220
That's how that mashed potatoes,
macaroni and cheese and stuff eat with

822
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:11,551
it.
I mean,

823
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:12,690
you know,
I've just,

824
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,950
uh,
you know,

825
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:15,690
I put,
like I said on that instagram page,

826
00:28:15,691 --> 00:28:16,524
I've got,
you know,

827
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,960
me exercising and doing stuff and you
know,

828
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,090
pictures and that was something that you
talked about,

829
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,040
uh,
outside of the studio right before we

830
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:26,610
came in that the studies that have been
done on people consuming meat,

831
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:30,750
and I brought this up as well,
that there's a lot of misconceptions

832
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:35,130
about the studies because they're not
very clear when they say that people who

833
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:38,820
eat meat five times a week are more
likely to get cancer.

834
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:43,050
What they're not telling you is what
these people eight along with the meat,

835
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,310
are they eating cheeseburgers or the
eating grass fed beef or it's grass

836
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:48,660
finished,
grass fed,

837
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,810
you know,
high in essential fatty acids healthy

838
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:52,170
for you.

839
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,610
Or are they eating some bullshit
cheeseburger with a sugary drink?

840
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,180
Like what is the rest of their diet?
Are they consuming a lot of refined

841
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:02,460
carbohydrates?
Are they consuming a lot of sugar?

842
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,920
Are they drinking alcohol?
They smoking cigarettes.

843
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,880
All you're saying is they're eating meat
five days a week.

844
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,610
It's not,
it's not specifying in any way their

845
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:13,330
actual overall diet.
You know,

846
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,680
they don't,
they don't sort that very,

847
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,830
very well out.
So they've got all these epidemiology

848
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:20,340
studies in basically a mediator is
basically someone and,

849
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,420
and you know,
we statistically,

850
00:29:21,421 --> 00:29:23,520
we know they're more likely to smoke,
they're more likely to drink.

851
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:25,050
They're more likely not to wear their
seatbelt.

852
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,540
They're more likely to be an accidents
are more likely not to go to their

853
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:28,350
doctor.
They're not,

854
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,750
they're more likely to just not to care.
So you've got,

855
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,950
that's what it means.
Why is that?

856
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,930
What's this cause people,
cause if I tell you,

857
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:37,050
as I say,
Joe eating meat's bad for you and you

858
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:38,250
say F you,
I don't care.

859
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:39,540
I don't care about my health.
Right,

860
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,740
right.
So you just don't care.

861
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,040
So is it,
so they can't

862
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,310
separate that out.
So they've got all these studies where

863
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:47,410
they,
they try to separate out and say well

864
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,990
what Kinda what Kinda even up to smokers
but they never can take that.

865
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:50,950
I don't give a,
you know,

866
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:53,740
I don't,
I don't give a fuck right thing out of

867
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,530
it.
So you've got this stuff and then all

868
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,280
the studies are really,
really low strength.

869
00:29:57,281 --> 00:30:00,760
So if we look at w you know,
and we can talk about this about meat,

870
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:02,620
meat,
meat being causing cancer.

871
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,360
Cause there was,
there's some concern about that with

872
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:06,730
colon cancer.
But if we look at smoking,

873
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,070
you know when they determine that
smoking causes cancer,

874
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:14,310
the epidemiology showed a 2000% increase
in the incidence of cancer.

875
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:18,040
And a lot of studies when they compare
that to meat and cancer,

876
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,340
they found an 18% increase,
which is nothing.

877
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:23,470
I mean it's like,
it's like it doesn't even matter.

878
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:27,550
It's so percent isn't high,
not not when you look at relative risk,

879
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,730
right?
So if your risk,

880
00:30:28,731 --> 00:30:33,050
if your risk of getting colon cancer is
one or say your,

881
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:38,060
your risk of getting colon cancer is a
five in a million.

882
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,800
Right?
And now it's six in a million.

883
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,100
I mean it's like nothing.
I mean it dislike it,

884
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:47,980
it's so minor.
But if your risk is going from five and

885
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:51,070
a million to 300 and a million,
then you're like,

886
00:30:51,071 --> 00:30:55,120
well that's pretty powerful.
So it depends on the incident.

887
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:58,120
So if it's really low to begin with and
you only raise it but tiny mountain,

888
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,420
it's so small.
And so what we know there was a guy

889
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:05,700
named Bradford Hill who talked about
statistical correlations on when this

890
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:09,970
things actually matter and not to,
you get to 200% or 300% does it even

891
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:11,860
matter?
You can't draw any conclusion from that.

892
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,970
The problem is 200 300% difference out
of like a thousand yeah.

893
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:20,060
So sort of two,
it would be six [inaudible],

894
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,160
right?
So instead of,

895
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,510
right.
So instead of being 18% more like a

896
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:26,590
year,
200% more likely that those numbers are

897
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:30,570
confusing to people though the way he's
saying 200% like what?

898
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,050
That's a lot of people,
right?

899
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:34,030
So,
so you would have to double or triple

900
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,030
your risk.
So 18% is not double or tripling.

901
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,220
That's only putting it up by it,
by a fraction.

902
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,153
Right?
Right.

903
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,470
So when you,
when you separate all that stuff out and

904
00:31:42,471 --> 00:31:43,181
then,
then you know,

905
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:44,014
there was,
uh,

906
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,410
you know,
the World Health Organization two years

907
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:48,191
ago,
last year,

908
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:52,090
two years ago,
declared that red meat wasn't class two

909
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:54,730
carcinogen.
Prosec meets was a class one carcinogen.

910
00:31:54,731 --> 00:31:56,710
You know,
they said it's like plutonium and

911
00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:58,870
smoking and you know,
everybody runs to runs all over the

912
00:31:58,871 --> 00:31:59,430
place with that.

913
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,450
Why'd they do that?
So here's why they do that.

914
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,990
So first of all,
and you can read,

915
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,300
you can go on their website,
you know,

916
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:06,340
they'll tell you what their,
what their conclusions were.

917
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,020
So this was done by an organization
called the International Association for

918
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,600
Research on cancer.
They're based on a Leland France and

919
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:14,730
they are,
uh,

920
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,480
you know,
that's what the World Health

921
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,730
Organization uses to determine their
stuff.

922
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:19,840
And so there are written,
and this is,

923
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,570
you know,
besides appointment right now the IRC is

924
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:24,580
under,
under investigation by the US Congress

925
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:28,810
for using crappy science and you know,
promoting political agenda.

926
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:31,600
So I don't know if that's true or not.
Part of that's generated by the probably

927
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:33,160
be corporations.
You don't like their findings,

928
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:35,110
but so they're under investigation for
that.

929
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:38,650
But what they say is we have some weak
epidemiology,

930
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,110
which is 18% stuff,
but we think we have some strong

931
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:43,820
mechanistic reasons for this.

932
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,620
Right?
So if everybody,

933
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:49,230
you know there's isn't,
there's a doctor named George Ead Ede

934
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,950
who's a,
who's a psychiatrist out in Maryland

935
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:53,300
who's got this,
this tremendous,

936
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:56,690
she analyzed the whole thing.
She has a website called diagnosis

937
00:32:56,691 --> 00:33:01,691
diet.com so she did an analyst analysis
of all the 800 studies they used and she

938
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:05,270
found that what they ended up doing is
most of them showed me,

939
00:33:05,271 --> 00:33:07,570
didn't cause cancer.
There was a small percentage it did.

940
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:12,440
And they looked at all these rat studies
and there was about 20 2025 rat studies.

941
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,080
And they found like three or four of
them showed meat.

942
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,210
You know,
if we gave this type of cancer,

943
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,120
if we gave this rat a certain,
you know,

944
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:23,990
amount of meat and we genetically bred
them and we gave them a ma,

945
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,950
a medicine that makes them get cancer,
that they get a little bit of change in

946
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:31,430
their colon that might turn into cancer
medicine that makes them get cancer.

947
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,790
Well I don't remember.
It's something there.

948
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,610
There's a special way to make get
cancer.

949
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:37,280
So they have this model that it makes
them get cancer really,

950
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,380
really easy.
So what they did is they felt,

951
00:33:39,381 --> 00:33:41,180
why did they do that?
If we're trying to find out if something

952
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:44,000
gives something cancer.
Well because they want to make it,

953
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,370
they want to be able to,
you know,

954
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:49,250
they want to differentiate that as quick
as possible because they've got to use a

955
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:50,710
million rats.
And I see,

956
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,500
I see what you're saying is the real
fast way to show up.

957
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:54,350
They get cancer.
But the problem with that,

958
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:57,080
and she explains it very well,
is that we don't know that they would

959
00:33:57,081 --> 00:33:57,810
get cancer.
It's,

960
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,650
and it's not shown.
And the other thing we talked about this

961
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:02,750
before is that if you want to look at a
rat studies,

962
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,640
and it's not to say that plants give you
cancer,

963
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:09,260
but there are pesticides and plants that
have been studying rats that we eat

964
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:09,890
every day.

965
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:14,240
Natural foods and vegetables and fruits
that also give racks cancer and so the

966
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:16,070
only difference is we've got,
you know,

967
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,420
submitted some really,
you mean things that natural compounds

968
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:23,350
that plants extract or they write
secreted in order,

969
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,490
does it discourage predation?
Exactly.

970
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:27,890
These natural substances,
when they feed them to rats and the

971
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:31,310
isolate them and feed them to rats,
it gives the rads cancer at 52 they kept

972
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:34,580
tested.
27 of them is just normal food that we

973
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:37,130
eat on [inaudible] stuff we do on a
daily basis.

974
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,080
So it's not to scare people out of
eating that stuff,

975
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:42,150
but it's just saying that's how much bs
and stuff is based upon.

976
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,180
It just seems to me to be so crazy that
they would,

977
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,160
the,
they're doing a cancer study and they

978
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:49,550
give the rat something that induces
cancer in order to find out what gives

979
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:50,570
him cancer more.

980
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,570
So they give them this compound and on
top of the compound and they,

981
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,690
they check their diet.
Right.

982
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,490
And they also feed them sugar with it,
you know?

983
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:01,190
So it's Kinda like,
it's just the way they do it,

984
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:02,150
you know,
and you know,

985
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,650
you can,
you can extrapolate.

986
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:05,270
Does that really matter to humans or
not?

987
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,650
It's just so hard to tell.
I mean,

988
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:08,840
there's so many things that animals can
eat that we can't.

989
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,700
It just,
the whole thing is bizarre.

990
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,271
Yeah.
I mean,

991
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:12,170
we're not rats,
you know?

992
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:12,891
That's interesting.
You know,

993
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:14,420
it's like the same thing when we talked
about,

994
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,490
you know,
cancer rates in the historical

995
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:17,420
populations,
you know,

996
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:18,111
what Messiah,
they didn't,

997
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:19,230
they didn't have much cancer,
you know,

998
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:21,410
not until we started feeding them,
you know,

999
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,350
the 1940 stories and stuff like that.
Nothing.

1000
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,720
So til we started feeding him all our
crap that they,

1001
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,930
that they started to get those diseases.
Yeah.

1002
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:30,770
That's,
uh,

1003
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,480
it's all very strange,
right.

1004
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:36,740
When you think about diet and health,
you also have to take into account

1005
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,000
geographically,

1006
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,030
uh,
the,

1007
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,250
the,
the geography that your ancestors

1008
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,460
evolved in and what did they,
what were they accustomed to eating?

1009
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:46,800
Like there's different adaptations for
the nun.

1010
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,500
For example,
adaptations to cold.

1011
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,890
They probably have requirements for
certain amount of dietary fat.

1012
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:54,621
Yeah,
I think it's,

1013
00:35:54,621 --> 00:35:55,550
you know,
this is what I think is,

1014
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,451
I think we're all,
you know,

1015
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:58,440
this is one of the things that people
talked about their so like,

1016
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:00,020
you know,
everybody is so different.

1017
00:36:00,021 --> 00:36:02,810
We have all this different genetics.
We need special diets.

1018
00:36:02,811 --> 00:36:04,820
I tend to say that,
you know,

1019
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,770
in certain circumstances that make
sense.

1020
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:07,700
But I think,
you know,

1021
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,200
evolutionary,
you know,

1022
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,540
we,
we sort of split from primates.

1023
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,640
You know,
we,

1024
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,960
we shared a common ancestor with
primates,

1025
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:16,400
chimpanzees,
Bonobos,

1026
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,040
gorillas somewhere eight to 10 million
years ago.

1027
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,850
We don't know for sure.
It was back and then,

1028
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:22,370
and so what happens is,
you know,

1029
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:24,830
the human,
the pre humans kind of went one way and

1030
00:36:24,831 --> 00:36:28,760
then the apes and chimpanzees went up to
swim when we went up into the trees.

1031
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,460
And if you look at,
you know,

1032
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,210
even the difference between a chimpanzee
in a,

1033
00:36:32,211 --> 00:36:33,470
in a,
in an ape,

1034
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,110
an ape or not an ape,
a gorilla,

1035
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,420
gorilla crushes all these,
you know,

1036
00:36:38,421 --> 00:36:40,310
these all really fibers,
food,

1037
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,930
lots of fiber and stuff like that.

1038
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,800
Chimpanzees can't tolerate that as well
because they're there.

1039
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,700
They're colon,
got a little smaller,

1040
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,900
will humans.
Colin's got way,

1041
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:50,210
way smaller,
right?

1042
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,540
And so what happened is why you and I
can throw a rock really far.

1043
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,750
You don't,
a chimpanzee chimpanzee can throw,

1044
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,800
you know,
if you give a Cimzia baseball,

1045
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:59,150
they can throw in about 20 miles an
hour.

1046
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,210
It's not very strong.
You and I can throw a baseball,

1047
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,130
you know,
60 miles an hour average guy,

1048
00:37:04,131 --> 00:37:04,630
you know,
if you get,

1049
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,320
you know,
major league baseball players are

1050
00:37:06,321 --> 00:37:07,640
throwing at 95 plus,
right?

1051
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,900
The reason we evolve to do that is
because we're throwing shit in animals.

1052
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:12,734
We were hunting.
Right.

1053
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,450
That's what drove,
I mean,

1054
00:37:14,451 --> 00:37:16,610
our scapula has rotated,
you know,

1055
00:37:16,611 --> 00:37:18,080
tim,
if you'll get a chimpanzee Scapula,

1056
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:18,760
it's,
it's,

1057
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,593
you know,
on the side,

1058
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,920
it allows him to crump,
climb trees and do this stuff.

1059
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,400
And so these strong climate based
evolutionary pressures,

1060
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:27,440
which drove us to saying,
you know,

1061
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:28,310
there's,
you know,

1062
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,580
you know,
there's all this ice age stuff going on.

1063
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:31,751
The,
the,

1064
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:34,550
the climate's drawing out the fruits and
the jungles are going away.

1065
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:36,710
Now it's all this grassland and you
know,

1066
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,900
there's not much eat in the grassland,
you know,

1067
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:39,890
except for some animals,
you know,

1068
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,870
people need some bugs and stuff like
that for awhile.

1069
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,311
And that's what,
you know,

1070
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:45,200
chimpanzees or even chimpanzees,
you know,

1071
00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:47,040
3% of their diet.
You know,

1072
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,970
there's a lot of people say we're
frugivores and always should be.

1073
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:51,530
It's fruit.
But even chimpanzees eat about 3% of

1074
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:52,820
their diet comes from killing other
animals.

1075
00:37:52,821 --> 00:37:53,654
I mean,
yeah,

1076
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,780
there's this red colobus monkey
somewhere and you can hand it or

1077
00:37:56,781 --> 00:37:59,000
somewhere in Africa,
the chimpanzees are hunting,

1078
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:00,360
listening to extinction.
The,

1079
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,940
they're,
they're good little hunters.

1080
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:02,774
But

1081
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,930
yeah,
there's a David attenborough documentary

1082
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:06,130
on it.
It's terrifying.

1083
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,650
And you see how organized they are to
kill monkeys.

1084
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,450
They have chimps at one end of this tree
line and they're coming this way and

1085
00:38:13,451 --> 00:38:16,060
they have chips on the side and they
chase him in and then they,

1086
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,920
they corner him,
they ambush them and they get them in

1087
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,780
the center and they just swarm them.

1088
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,761
That's amazing.
I mean,

1089
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:21,541
and you know,
think about it.

1090
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:23,760
Their brain is not even half as big as
ours.

1091
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,110
I mean,
so when humans sort of,

1092
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:25,944
no,
I think that's,

1093
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:29,120
I think it's pretty clear that what
drove a lot of our evolution,

1094
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,750
evolution,
our ability to communicate,

1095
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:31,740
to strategize.
You know,

1096
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:33,810
some of the anatomic things was based
around hunting.

1097
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,680
I mean,
hunting,

1098
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:36,160
I know you're a hunter Geo,
and I know it's,

1099
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,860
it's not an easy thing to do.
You've got to think a lot.

1100
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:39,940
You know,
you've got to be pretty smart.

1101
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:42,160
Dot Smart.
These animals I'm supposed to be when

1102
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:44,260
you're in big groups and been back then
when they've got,

1103
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,161
you know,
I got it.

1104
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:46,480
Spears basically,
you know,

1105
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:49,600
you look at a,
there was a population in central Europe

1106
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:54,040
called the Gravettian is right.
So if you look at population markers for

1107
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,360
nutrition,
right?

1108
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,123
The,
uh,

1109
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,170
one of the things I look at is
population height.

1110
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,630
So if there's a real top height tall
population,

1111
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,730
it means that they had really good
nutrition.

1112
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,910
And so if you look at the tallest people
that probably ever live where these

1113
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:10,690
gravette that teams,
these guys were just decimating

1114
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:11,530
mammoths.
I mean,

1115
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:13,270
they were so efficient at killing
mammoths.

1116
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:15,730
And so that's probably basically all
they ate.

1117
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,601
You know,
for the most part,

1118
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:18,160
they might have a little vegetables,
but they are,

1119
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,680
they were there advertise it was like
six foot two.

1120
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:23,050
And this is like 30,000 years ago.
That's crazy.

1121
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,820
So these things have been giant.
They were giants.

1122
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,280
And so the people that have did,
have sort of genetically are related to

1123
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,120
those people now are the people from
Croatia and the Netherlands were turning

1124
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:33,340
in the tallest people in the world.
The only other group that rivaled that

1125
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,270
are the neurotic,
uh,

1126
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,760
Africans,
which are like the,

1127
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:39,460
what to see in the Messiah,
which are all about six feet tall and

1128
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:40,150
average.

1129
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,600
And their diet is primarily as we know,
livestock based.

1130
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:47,230
And then the other tall population
historically were the plains Indian,

1131
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,290
particularly in the Cheyenne Injury
Indians and they just lived on mostly

1132
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:51,580
buffalo.
So it's kind of,

1133
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,660
it's kind of interesting as far as
what's the best food for nutrition,

1134
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,770
you know,
and uh,

1135
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,940
you know,
that's what I'm finding from a

1136
00:39:57,941 --> 00:39:59,320
performance standpoint,
you know,

1137
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:01,550
it's just will make me feel the best and
work the best.

1138
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:04,660
Do you supplement,
do you take vitamins or minerals or

1139
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:05,500
anything?
You know,

1140
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:06,301
I don't,
you know what,

1141
00:40:06,301 --> 00:40:07,070
I just,
you know,

1142
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,960
I,
I kind of,

1143
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,823
you know,
just,

1144
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,110
I mean,
well I will say I take some salt,

1145
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:11,970
salt,
my meat,

1146
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:12,490
you know,
I mean,

1147
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,890
I'll have some Himalayan salt or some
regular sauna.

1148
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:18,430
How do you normally cook?
You Cook for yourself also time and you

1149
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:19,530
get pretty good at cooking steaks.

1150
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,060
You haven't,
so I'll either reverse here,

1151
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,030
you know,
you know how to,

1152
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:26,020
you know how to reverse sear here,
reverse sear a steak in a cast and cook

1153
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:29,560
it slowly,
slowly low heat to talk to internal

1154
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:30,410
temperature.
I do,

1155
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,290
I just like,
but medium rare and then a throw in a

1156
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,870
pan for a couple minutes and sear it up
and they need it or I'll just throw it

1157
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:35,531
on the grill.
You know,

1158
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:36,400
it depends where I'm,
where I'm at.

1159
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:38,440
If from California,
I got a grill,

1160
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:39,310
Harish,
I'll throw one in the grill.

1161
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,450
If I'm back,
you know,

1162
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,560
in another,
in New Mexico,

1163
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:42,370
I'll,
I'll just,

1164
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,420
I'll do it to come and have a girl
there.

1165
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:45,390
So I do that.
But that's that,

1166
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,530
you know,
it takes a,

1167
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,300
you know,
a couple of minutes to do a lot of

1168
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:51,310
supermarket runs cause that get
expensive.

1169
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,140
It's gotta be an expensive diet and
yeah.

1170
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,220
So I mean it's,
you know,

1171
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:55,150
it depends,
you know,

1172
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:56,260
it depends on,
you know,

1173
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:57,850
again,
how much I'm probably eating more than

1174
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,040
the average person that does this diet
that I'm aware of.

1175
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:03,070
She only goes about two pounds,
two pounds of meat.

1176
00:41:03,071 --> 00:41:05,110
And so they can do day a day.
Right.

1177
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:06,720
And so a lot of people,
you know,

1178
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,750
people that are,
that are,

1179
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:08,531
uh,
you know,

1180
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:10,660
don't have the budget of the stupid like
ground beef and stuff like that.

1181
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:12,880
And you can do,
you can eat two pounds of ground beef

1182
00:41:12,881 --> 00:41:13,420
for,
you know,

1183
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,850
under 10 bucks a day,
which is right.

1184
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,291
Wait,
you know,

1185
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:16,810
it's two cups of starbucks,
you know,

1186
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:19,510
something like that.
So it's actually not that bad for a lot

1187
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:22,420
of people.
Now there's also people that have

1188
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,700
ethical concerns about the consumption
of animals,

1189
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:27,430
especially the consumption of factory
farmed animals.

1190
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,470
Sir,
on a mass basis.

1191
00:41:29,471 --> 00:41:31,030
I mean,
you're probably responsible for a whole

1192
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,010
goddamn feel.
Dead Cows.

1193
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,891
Yeah.
So I mean,

1194
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:34,730
I think,
I mean,

1195
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:37,100
I think I have a concern.
I think people that eat meat should be

1196
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:39,170
concerned about,
and we're the ones that primarily need

1197
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:42,470
to make sure that's not happening.
And so I think,

1198
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:43,400
you know,
as you know,

1199
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,260
you know,
I would argue that,

1200
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,330
you know,
since evolution began,

1201
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:50,180
humans have been eating meat and that's
just what happens in nature.

1202
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:52,630
You know,
if you look at how an animal's killing a

1203
00:41:52,631 --> 00:41:54,590
wild,
if Elian takes down under zebra,

1204
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,320
it's not a pleasant experience for that
animal.

1205
00:41:57,321 --> 00:42:00,110
And so most of the way that humans kill
these animals now,

1206
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,910
you know,
from it from a humane say,

1207
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:03,200
it's pretty darn humane.
I mean,

1208
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:04,240
even as a hunter,
you know,

1209
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:06,020
if you hit an animal and you don't get
them,

1210
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,280
you know,
you don't hit on the right spot,

1211
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,000
you got to track him down and he's going
to,

1212
00:42:09,001 --> 00:42:11,420
it may take an hour or longer.

1213
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:16,310
So the issue is not necessarily even
just the eventual death of the animal,

1214
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:18,710
it's also the life of the animal was
killed.

1215
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,670
Yeah,
I agree with that too.

1216
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:20,810
And so I think that,
uh,

1217
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,820
you know,
you have to look at,

1218
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,560
um,
you know,

1219
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:27,050
if the animals,
like if you've got chickens in cages and

1220
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:29,750
they can't turn around right,
and they're just as cramped in there,

1221
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:30,361
that's awful.
No,

1222
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:32,820
it shouldn't be allowed.
One of the reasons they put chicken in

1223
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,670
case cause they'll peck the hell out of
each other.

1224
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,930
You know,
if they don't say anything they'll just

1225
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,430
tear each other up.
So that,

1226
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,920
you know,
there are different considerations on

1227
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:39,830
that.
You know,

1228
00:42:39,831 --> 00:42:41,270
if you have an animal that you're,
you know,

1229
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:43,310
cause I talked to a lot of cattle
ranchers and most of them,

1230
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:47,090
I mean most of them they really care
about their animals are out in the snow

1231
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:49,430
and the rain,
making sure their animals are fed,

1232
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:50,500
making sure they're sheltered.

1233
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,130
You know,
if an animal goes down there taking care

1234
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:52,964
of that.
So,

1235
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,010
you know,
there's probably some bad apples out

1236
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:58,640
there and if we know about that stuff
and some Vegan documentary guy wants to

1237
00:42:58,641 --> 00:42:59,870
make a film about that,
then yeah,

1238
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:02,840
those guys should be saying,
hey don't mistreat your animals.

1239
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:03,674
You know,
don't,

1240
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,210
you know,
intentionally hurt them.

1241
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:06,890
Don't have them standing in a pilot
crap.

1242
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,971
You know,
give them some,

1243
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:08,804
give them some,
you know,

1244
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,940
fresh air and some,
some ability to move.

1245
00:43:10,941 --> 00:43:12,570
But you know,
you know,

1246
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,470
if you look cows or animals in the wild,
they're herd animals anyway.

1247
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:19,130
So they hang out together anyway.
It's not like if they're indoors now,

1248
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:22,850
if they're indoors and they've got no
room to move around and they go in and

1249
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:23,631
go out,
I think that'll,

1250
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:25,550
I think that's a big issue.
And so I think you have to kind of,

1251
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,470
you know,
you can't just make it all black and

1252
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,540
white.
There's some people that are good at it.

1253
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,810
Some people are bad.
The bad ones need to be made not to do

1254
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:34,760
that anymore.
But it doesn't change the fact that we

1255
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:35,510
all need to eat.

1256
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:39,830
There's a company called butcher box
that'll sell you a grass fed grass

1257
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:41,420
finished beef too.
They send it to you.

1258
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:43,550
They're one of the sponsors of the show.
And,

1259
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:44,271
uh,
I've,

1260
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:46,250
I've eaten there meat.
It's very good.

1261
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,060
And if you're a certain,
if you're in a place and we have it,

1262
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:49,894
like,
uh,

1263
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:55,660
isn't there like some sort of like a,
like a password or something that we

1264
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:59,720
give them to see what could find that?
But,

1265
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,030
um,
there's,

1266
00:44:02,031 --> 00:44:05,630
there's ways to get,
I mean you have to search for it though.

1267
00:44:05,631 --> 00:44:10,490
It's not meat that you get.
You don't really exactly know how the

1268
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:12,000
person is raising it.
It's,

1269
00:44:12,001 --> 00:44:12,834
it's hard.
I mean if you can go,

1270
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,830
unless you go to a,
some sort of a farmer's market or

1271
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:17,000
something like that,
okay.

1272
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:22,070
You can get $10 off plus free bacon by
using the code word Rogan and butcher

1273
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:25,610
box.com.
So butcher box is one option.

1274
00:44:25,611 --> 00:44:27,280
There's a,
I'm sure there's,

1275
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,270
like I said,
farmers markets are great too.

1276
00:44:29,271 --> 00:44:32,070
You can actually meet the ranchers and
uh,

1277
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:34,110
you know,
get a sense of how they raise these

1278
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:36,840
animals.
But I think for health wise it's really

1279
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:40,140
critical to get grass fed grass raised
to get the best.

1280
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,980
Did you pay attention to that or do you
just take whatever you can get?

1281
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:45,183
Yeah,
so I think,

1282
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,131
I think,
you know,

1283
00:44:46,131 --> 00:44:47,720
I think you're right in the fact that if
you say,

1284
00:44:47,721 --> 00:44:52,721
what is the most nutrient dense,
what is the best quality I can get grass

1285
00:44:53,481 --> 00:44:55,520
fed grass finished is going to fill that
bill.

1286
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,800
Now,
if you compare that to something that

1287
00:44:57,801 --> 00:44:58,550
was,
you know,

1288
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,660
fed corn,
right?

1289
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:04,400
And given hormones and given antibiotics
and what else did I do?

1290
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,521
You know,
so you know,

1291
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:10,130
you've got those things and it's fed no
grain the difference nutritionally

1292
00:45:10,131 --> 00:45:11,750
compared to,
you know,

1293
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:14,480
cause if you don't have any money and
you can't afford the stuff compared to

1294
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:17,000
the rest of the crap and the supermarket
is,

1295
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:17,863
you know,
so,

1296
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:20,390
so I'll use it,
I'll use a mma analogy for you.

1297
00:45:20,391 --> 00:45:22,580
So have grass fed,
grain fed beef is,

1298
00:45:22,581 --> 00:45:25,160
you know,
conor Mcgregor or GSP,

1299
00:45:25,161 --> 00:45:28,070
right?
Then there's other stuff is say some guy

1300
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:30,260
who's like the number three contenders
or something like that,

1301
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,340
that close the differences.

1302
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:34,170
And you know,
because you look at hormones and beat,

1303
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:34,710
you know,
so,

1304
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:35,960
so you don't want any hormones in your
media,

1305
00:45:35,961 --> 00:45:36,621
right?
Right.

1306
00:45:36,621 --> 00:45:38,570
You don't want antibiotics in your
media,

1307
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,260
the right,
so you're in your grass fed beef,

1308
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,650
even the Lq kill,
you've got hormones in that stuff

1309
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:45,290
because the animal makes it natural
course.

1310
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,620
So you're getting a ventral horn hard
getting on very low level.

1311
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:52,940
And so what they do is they give those
animals generally the same hormones.

1312
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:56,420
It didn't increase as a percentage,
a little bit more compared to what you

1313
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:57,830
and I make normally.
So if they,

1314
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,370
if we look at like grants,
you know what maybe,

1315
00:46:01,371 --> 00:46:02,750
you know,
I can't remember the numbers exactly,

1316
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,870
but the scale is what's important.
So if they give you,

1317
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:10,010
if grass fed beef gives you five Nanning
rams of estrogen,

1318
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,550
okay,
grain fed beef gives you 10 nanograms of

1319
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:16,160
estrogen and then you compare it to
eggs,

1320
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:19,670
which give you maybe 90 and you compare
it to dairy,

1321
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:22,940
which gives you 110 and then you compare
it to,

1322
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,250
you know,
uh,

1323
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,420
if you look at Fido estrogens,
you know,

1324
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:28,010
that's,
that's in the millions,

1325
00:46:28,011 --> 00:46:28,310
right?

1326
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,080
So,
so things like soy beans and stuff like

1327
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:31,700
that,
and then you compare it to what is your

1328
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:35,570
body naturally make?
And that's like 30 or 40,000.

1329
00:46:35,571 --> 00:46:39,210
And so it's a really small level.
So I think if you can afford grass fed

1330
00:46:39,211 --> 00:46:40,790
and grain fed,
you know,

1331
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:42,860
I'm,
I'm not saying how can you solve the

1332
00:46:42,861 --> 00:46:44,240
world's problem?
And I think if you're just telling,

1333
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:47,720
if we just isolate for health only,
so you're a poor guy and all you can

1334
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,850
afford is,
you know,

1335
00:46:49,851 --> 00:46:52,520
I can't afford his grasp and mean I
can't for 20 bucks a pound for this

1336
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:53,354
stuff,
right?

1337
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,340
And butcher box is still too expensive
for me,

1338
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,420
then that's probably still a better
option than going back and eating,

1339
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,730
you know,
uh,

1340
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,210
the other crap,
the other car,

1341
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,160
the cheetos and uh,
you know,

1342
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,900
all this other stuff.
And even though you don't like the

1343
00:47:05,901 --> 00:47:07,610
organic fruits and stuff like that,
you know,

1344
00:47:07,611 --> 00:47:09,020
it's just expensive for people.

1345
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:09,741
So,
I mean,

1346
00:47:09,741 --> 00:47:10,371
I think it's,
you know,

1347
00:47:10,371 --> 00:47:12,270
like I said,
it depends on who your audiences,

1348
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,600
you know,
if you've got unlimited resources and

1349
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:17,210
most people don't,
then you have to say what's,

1350
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:18,044
you know,
what's,

1351
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,710
you know,
from a health standpoint,

1352
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:23,270
what is most affordable and what's
practical?

1353
00:47:23,271 --> 00:47:24,800
How do I get my health back?
Because this is,

1354
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:25,251
you know,
I don't,

1355
00:47:25,251 --> 00:47:26,210
like I said,
I don't really,

1356
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:29,000
I'm not like saying this is the best
diet in the world.

1357
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,640
Everybody,
I'm just saying you need to find out

1358
00:47:30,641 --> 00:47:31,690
what works for you.
Right.

1359
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,930
But basically what you're saying is that
grass fed beef is better,

1360
00:47:34,931 --> 00:47:37,090
but it's only slightly better for you.
Right?

1361
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,950
I mean in the grand scheme of things,
right?

1362
00:47:38,951 --> 00:47:42,730
So if you're saying I want to be as good
as I possibly can be and that I said

1363
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:44,830
probably grass fed,
grain fed and grass when it's probably

1364
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:47,410
better if you're like saying I'm just
sick and I don't want to be sick

1365
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:49,720
anymore,
then I'd say get what you can afford.

1366
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,430
So you really think that meat is in some
ways a panacea for health.

1367
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:58,720
You think that it really,
if you just eat more meat that your body

1368
00:47:58,721 --> 00:48:01,570
will be what?
More vibrant and more healthy and like

1369
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:03,820
what is,
what is it about meat specifically?

1370
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,080
Well I think it's,
you know,

1371
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,970
so this is another sort of
misconception.

1372
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:10,870
So I think a lot of it's extremely well
absorbed in our body.

1373
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:12,910
I mean it's look at the end result of
why we,

1374
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:14,560
what do we do when we,
when we're eating.

1375
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:15,820
Okay.
What's the end result?

1376
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,860
We eat for two reasons.
We ill eat to get energy and to build an

1377
00:48:19,861 --> 00:48:22,450
animal tissue.
I mean you and I are animals or animal

1378
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:25,720
tissue.
The most efficient way to do that is

1379
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:27,670
just eatsa because your body has,
it has,

1380
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,310
it says everything in the,
in the proportions that we need it.

1381
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,740
Right?
And it's,

1382
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,890
you know,
it's a misconception.

1383
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:33,730
You know,
when you hear,

1384
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,470
a lot of people will say,
you know,

1385
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,970
if he'd be a bunch of me just kind of
sit there and rot in your intestines and

1386
00:48:38,971 --> 00:48:40,600
it's going to putrefying and stuff like
that.

1387
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:45,490
So they've done studies on people who
have had ileostomies and these are

1388
00:48:45,491 --> 00:48:46,750
people that have had their colon
removed,

1389
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,180
right?
So you've had colon cancer,

1390
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:53,170
inflammatory bowel disease,
like Crohn's disease where they take out

1391
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:55,930
your whole colon and now you've got a
little back what you pooped until this

1392
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:56,764
little bag,
right?

1393
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,770
So they've looked at people and they've
looked at what comes out when they eat

1394
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,930
meat.
Almost nothing comes out.

1395
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,280
There's a little bit of liquid,
right?

1396
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,040
So that means all that means is being
absorbed,

1397
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,290
you know?
But when you get a bunch of fiber and

1398
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:10,930
vegetables and plants,
all that stuff goes up in the back

1399
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:11,830
because you can't digest it.

1400
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:13,960
You got to have,
you have to have bacteria in your colon

1401
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,530
to do that in humans are not really good
at it compared to other primates.

1402
00:49:17,531 --> 00:49:20,230
We're really bad at it.
What about probiotics?

1403
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,390
So I think probiotics,
you know,

1404
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:26,860
the microbiome is fascinating and
there's a lot of research going on.

1405
00:49:26,861 --> 00:49:28,530
There's a lot of people just talking all
about the stuff,

1406
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,380
how it affects your health.
One of the things that we,

1407
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,150
we try to say is how do we define a
healthy microbiome?

1408
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:36,280
You can't yet.
We just don't know enough.

1409
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:37,540
There are,
you know,

1410
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,340
we can't even,
we don't even know everything about the

1411
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:42,550
human body.
And then to put in tens of billions of

1412
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:43,750
different bacteria,
whole different,

1413
00:49:43,751 --> 00:49:46,630
different species and say,
this is the perfect combination and

1414
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:48,730
that's perfectly fine.
But we're so far away from knowing that

1415
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:51,010
we're in the very infancy and what that
means.

1416
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:53,500
So what I would say is if you are
healthy,

1417
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,930
you know,
if your joints don't hurt,

1418
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,110
if everything's going good,
then probably by definition your

1419
00:49:59,111 --> 00:50:02,590
microbiome is fine.
If you're eating just a meat based diet,

1420
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,910
your microbiome is going to be different
in the probiotics are probably not going

1421
00:50:04,911 --> 00:50:06,490
to make a difference for him.
But if you're eating,

1422
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,910
if you're eating a crappy diet,
you know,

1423
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,150
and you're fitting your,
your gut,

1424
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:12,970
a bunch of sugar,
you're going to get this dysbiosis,

1425
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,080
which is bad,
you know,

1426
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:16,840
bad bacteria.
And then,

1427
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:18,100
um,
you know,

1428
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,740
maybe the private probiotics might help
in that situation.

1429
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:21,730
I'm not convinced,
you know,

1430
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,650
I just,
I just don't think there's a,

1431
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:25,990
you know,
enough evidence to show that that's a

1432
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:27,130
big deal.
That's interesting.

1433
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,280
So you think that perhaps

1434
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,580
maybe the probiotics exist or maybe the
probiotics are healthy?

1435
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:34,880
It's my
freaking out.

1436
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:38,060
Well,
audio levels.

1437
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,200
Yeah.
Too loud.

1438
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,230
No,
not long enough.

1439
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:41,063
Let's talk.
So,

1440
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,890
um,
so the probiotics you think maybe only

1441
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:50,891
beneficial if people are consuming a lot
of variable things are a very diet,

1442
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:53,810
like carbohydrates,
all sorts of different things.

1443
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:57,500
And then maybe the co,
the probiotics are necessary to sort of

1444
00:50:57,501 --> 00:50:58,880
balance you out.
Is that what you're thinking?

1445
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,500
I mean,
that potentially could be the case.

1446
00:51:00,501 --> 00:51:03,560
So you think that the microbiome of
someone who eats meat is probably

1447
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,970
designed to eat meat?

1448
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:05,811
Well,
it is.

1449
00:51:05,811 --> 00:51:06,200
I mean,
I,

1450
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,600
your,
your microbiome reacts to whatever you

1451
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:10,370
do,
how much sleep you get,

1452
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:12,350
how much exercise you do,
how much you eat,

1453
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,510
how much stress is in your life.
This is very,

1454
00:51:14,511 --> 00:51:16,220
very adaptable.
It can change in a day,

1455
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:17,001
right?
You know,

1456
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:19,190
so whatever you're feeding it
chronically is going to change.

1457
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:20,900
What wouldn't,
what bacteria live there.

1458
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:21,951
So,
you know,

1459
00:51:21,951 --> 00:51:23,330
it's like this thing about,
you know,

1460
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,250
again,
back to this meet putrefaction thing.

1461
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:28,060
So if we look at the definition of
putrefaction here,

1462
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,851
sounds awful,
right?

1463
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:29,750
It's putrefying,
right?

1464
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,860
Putrefaction is the activity of bacteria
on protein,

1465
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,750
right?
So protein getting your colon,

1466
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:37,160
it'll pewter fry,
right?

1467
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,680
So again,
when we go back to these ileostomies

1468
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,600
patients,
they studied people that were getting

1469
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:43,760
soy,
protein and meat,

1470
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,190
and guess which one had more protein
going into the colon?

1471
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,050
Soy Protein.
So meeting and what to soit means stuff

1472
00:51:51,051 --> 00:51:54,170
means more proteins going into your
colon and your getting it more future

1473
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:55,000
facts in that way.

1474
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,250
Is that rumor,
like I know very little about what soy

1475
00:51:58,251 --> 00:52:02,590
supposed to do to you in terms of like
raising your estrogen levels.

1476
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,200
Is that supposed to be a real thing?

1477
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,620
Well,
I mean there's a lot of people think so.

1478
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:08,120
I mean there's some studies that support
that.

1479
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:09,410
I don't know for sure.
I mean,

1480
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:11,150
I don't,
I don't think soy is a particularly good

1481
00:52:11,151 --> 00:52:13,310
food for us.
I know some people will say that

1482
00:52:13,311 --> 00:52:14,750
fermented soy,
you know,

1483
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:15,950
it is a little better.
Yeah,

1484
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,300
heard that's good for you actually
write,

1485
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:18,830
what does that called?
Not to,

1486
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:20,930
not only not,
I think it's an Asian type thing,

1487
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:23,450
but you know,
I think that there's certainly some

1488
00:52:23,451 --> 00:52:26,870
people that think there's a lot of
associations that guys getting

1489
00:52:26,871 --> 00:52:29,020
Gynecomastia and stuff like that from
eating too much.

1490
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,370
Guys really done that.
I feel like that's one of those things

1491
00:52:32,371 --> 00:52:33,570
where people just tell you,
hey man,

1492
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,413
you're gonna get bitch too.
Them.

1493
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,050
I,
you know,

1494
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,360
I've got no idea.
I honestly guys getting that from

1495
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:39,160
anything other than steroids.
I mean,

1496
00:52:39,161 --> 00:52:40,030
they're,
they're,

1497
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,830
they're supposedly are.
I don't know for sure.

1498
00:52:41,831 --> 00:52:43,450
I can't say.
I can't say for sure.

1499
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,920
Okay.
Yeah.

1500
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:48,010
Um,
so now that you've been doing this,

1501
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:50,500
do you plan on,
you've done it for a year now,

1502
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,640
do you plan on continuing this for life?
Is this your diet now or are you going

1503
00:52:53,641 --> 00:52:54,820
to mix it up a little like,

1504
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,150
right.
So I'm going to,

1505
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:59,000
you know,
I seriously doubt I will not eat a ton

1506
00:52:59,001 --> 00:52:59,690
of meat.
You know,

1507
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:01,010
I just think I feel too good.
I mean,

1508
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,550
I think I want to feel good and perform
as good as I can for as long as I can.

1509
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:07,070
So whether I say,
and this is what I tell people,

1510
00:53:07,071 --> 00:53:09,330
you know,
do it for a couple months,

1511
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,970
you know,
because this is one of the problems,

1512
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:12,290
so many people that have health
problems,

1513
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:15,200
and I think a lot of it's food related
and it's really hard to sort that out.

1514
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,120
You know,
if you're eating a hundred different

1515
00:53:17,121 --> 00:53:18,890
types of food,
which one is it?

1516
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,180
I don't know.
I'm gonna,

1517
00:53:20,181 --> 00:53:21,470
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna drop this out.

1518
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,380
Right.
So,

1519
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,520
and it's obviously variable in terms of
your own individual biology.

1520
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:26,840
Right?

1521
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,501
Right.
So,

1522
00:53:27,501 --> 00:53:30,080
but I mean,
when you dropped down to just meet then

1523
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,100
it's pretty easy.
You just say,

1524
00:53:31,101 --> 00:53:33,160
okay,
I'm only meeting now if I add fruit back

1525
00:53:33,161 --> 00:53:34,970
hand,
does that f me up or not?

1526
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,620
You know,
if it does and I'm like,

1527
00:53:36,621 --> 00:53:38,430
man,
I shouldn't probably eat that if I eat

1528
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:42,080
dairy backhand.
So probably there'll be a point when

1529
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:42,681
I'll say,
hey,

1530
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:43,231
I'm going to,
you know,

1531
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:43,910
I mean,
you know,

1532
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:46,010
maybe once in a while I have a,
you know,

1533
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,450
have some berries again,
you know,

1534
00:53:47,451 --> 00:53:50,150
and then to see how I do with that.
I mean there's nothing wrong with that.

1535
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,820
There are a lot of people,
I'll tell you that these guys have been

1536
00:53:52,821 --> 00:53:54,320
doing it for five,
eight,

1537
00:53:54,321 --> 00:53:55,940
10 15 years.
I mean,

1538
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:56,421
they're like,
man,

1539
00:53:56,421 --> 00:53:58,460
that stuff to have screws me up and I
don't want to do that.

1540
00:53:58,490 --> 00:53:59,540
Who was the guy that you were saying?

1541
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,460
Did you find that gentleman online?
Young,

1542
00:54:01,461 --> 00:54:03,680
jammy.
The uh,

1543
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,500
did you get the tab?
I had a few people up,

1544
00:54:06,501 --> 00:54:08,130
but I've pulled him off.
Which one?

1545
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,560
The guy that he was saying,
oh,

1546
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:10,480
Anderson,
Joey.

1547
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:12,400
And I couldn't find him.
It was a,

1548
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,340
can you,
if you go out,

1549
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,310
if you go on my instagram,
there's about,

1550
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:19,190
I don't know,
about a month or two ago,

1551
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,590
I've got a picture I put up for these
people.

1552
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,080
These are all people that have done it
for a total of 55 years.

1553
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,180
Okay.
And there's one guy,

1554
00:54:25,181 --> 00:54:26,970
he's a marathon runner.
Uh,

1555
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,590
and then these other two couples that
have been doing it for 20 years and

1556
00:54:29,591 --> 00:54:31,500
other Gal,
there's nothing galleries was Kelly

1557
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,333
Hogan and that,
uh,

1558
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:37,400
she was like big morbidly obese woman
and she went on a conversation,

1559
00:54:37,401 --> 00:54:39,830
she's not for eight years and she got
super lean.

1560
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,660
Uh,
she was to totally in fertile,

1561
00:54:41,661 --> 00:54:42,980
couldn't have kids,
right?

1562
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,660
Super Lean carnivores.
Dot.

1563
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,490
Three kids later,
happy as can be.

1564
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,410
All she does is eat hamburgers every
day.

1565
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,273
I mean,
that's,

1566
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:50,260
I mean it's,
it's,

1567
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:50,710
it's,
you know,

1568
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:52,070
the stories I get,
you know,

1569
00:54:52,071 --> 00:54:56,330
this is because now I'm this kind of
central point and I get all these crazy,

1570
00:54:56,331 --> 00:54:59,360
crazy stories of people just,
just from talking about it online,

1571
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:00,141
just from talking.
Yeah.

1572
00:55:00,141 --> 00:55:01,580
It's kind of like sending,
is that?

1573
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,320
Well,
it's kind of like a little movement,

1574
00:55:03,321 --> 00:55:05,900
I think.
And I think what you'll see over the

1575
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,250
next year or two,
there's going to be a lot more people

1576
00:55:07,251 --> 00:55:08,540
doing this just to try it.
You know?

1577
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:09,111
And I think it's,
you know,

1578
00:55:09,111 --> 00:55:11,240
it's a crazy,
some people are going to do it just to

1579
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:11,571
say,
hey,

1580
00:55:11,571 --> 00:55:12,620
it's cool.
I'm going to be a carnivore.

1581
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:13,760
I'm just gonna.
I'm going to screw around.

1582
00:55:13,761 --> 00:55:17,510
But I think there's people that honestly
are doing it and they're really

1583
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:20,930
seriously improving their health.
And I think whatever works is what you

1584
00:55:20,931 --> 00:55:21,710
should do.

1585
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:24,500
Well,
I think that the removal of refined

1586
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:27,560
carbohydrates almost helps everybody.
No,

1587
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:28,620
I agree.
100% done.

1588
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:32,720
If not the removal,
the severe restriction,

1589
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,760
just restrict most car.
I mean,

1590
00:55:34,761 --> 00:55:38,570
I think a day a week just have at it,
have a fucking slice of pizza who gives

1591
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:41,000
a shit go to town.
I don't think there's anything wrong

1592
00:55:41,001 --> 00:55:44,240
with a cheat day,
but I think overall refined

1593
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:49,241
carbohydrates just do not seem to be a
healthy nor normal thing for your body

1594
00:55:49,521 --> 00:55:50,354
to consume.

1595
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,230
Well,
if we look at,

1596
00:55:51,231 --> 00:55:52,370
you know,
historically,

1597
00:55:52,371 --> 00:55:53,300
I mean,
you know,

1598
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:56,480
we didn't start consuming dairy and all
about 12,000 years going to start

1599
00:55:56,481 --> 00:55:59,630
farming until about the same time.
So those things aren't in living novel.

1600
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,490
You know,
we didn't start eating all this

1601
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:03,260
processed stuff all about a hundred you
know,

1602
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,530
Chris Cole came on in 1910 or something
like it's all that crap we've invented

1603
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:09,320
in the last century.
And then when the high fructose corn

1604
00:56:09,321 --> 00:56:13,220
syrup came in in the 70s all this stuff
our human body just hasn't evolved for

1605
00:56:13,221 --> 00:56:14,180
yet.
So I think we're getting,

1606
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,190
we're getting seriously messed up.

1607
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,550
Yeah.
And if you look at the change in our

1608
00:56:18,551 --> 00:56:20,770
diet,
there's a corresponding uptick and

1609
00:56:20,771 --> 00:56:24,160
diabetes and all sorts of other obesity
and health

1610
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,730
issues,
sugar and refined carbohydrates tills.

1611
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:28,690
The two big ones.
There were,

1612
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:32,500
the other debate is whether or not
eating all this meat is healthy for you.

1613
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:35,020
And what about diverticulitis?
Have you ever heard about people getting

1614
00:56:35,021 --> 00:56:37,480
that?
Cause I know a d that's what brock

1615
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:39,700
lesnar got.
And one of the things that they said

1616
00:56:39,701 --> 00:56:41,590
that he got it from just eating mostly
meat.

1617
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:42,760
Yeah.
This is interesting because there's

1618
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:46,960
actually a gunny,
pier e p e r r y did a study in 2014 he

1619
00:56:46,961 --> 00:56:48,910
did colonoscopies,
right?

1620
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,850
So he actually looked at people who was
one of the first ones to do this and he

1621
00:56:51,851 --> 00:56:54,970
looked at people on these diets and he
found that the people that ate the

1622
00:56:54,971 --> 00:56:59,560
highest amount of fiber and had the most
bowel movements had the most incidents

1623
00:56:59,561 --> 00:57:02,080
of diverticulosis.
So diverticulosis proceeds

1624
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:04,560
diverticulitis.
So diverticulosis,

1625
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:06,430
a little pouch that shoots out from your
colon.

1626
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:09,040
So it's like a little sack.
So what happens is that eventually gets

1627
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:12,970
infected and then you get diverticulitis
with the people that were developing

1628
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,540
diverticulosis and most in his study,
he did two or three like this show,

1629
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:18,820
the ones that are reading a bunch of
fiber.

1630
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:22,030
And there's also studies on so that
fiber gets caught or somethings that

1631
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:24,010
potentially,
so the question is one of the thing

1632
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:24,970
people don't understand,
you know,

1633
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:27,630
cause a lot of people want to talk about
ketogenic diets.

1634
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:28,960
They cut out their fiber,
they're like,

1635
00:57:28,961 --> 00:57:30,310
you're gonna get all constipated,
right?

1636
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:31,560
I mean,
you know,

1637
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,550
so basically I haven't had a bowel
movement in a year.

1638
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,070
You know,
it's got Ya.

1639
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,050
That's not true obviously.
But so what happens is you just don't

1640
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:39,270
make anything.
I mean you,

1641
00:57:39,271 --> 00:57:41,740
you know all that meat,
it goes right into your small

1642
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:43,810
intestines.
It's absorbs from next to nothing.

1643
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,630
It gets to your colon.
And so it takes,

1644
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,391
yeah,
there's nothing,

1645
00:57:46,391 --> 00:57:48,430
there's hardly anything.
You can take a little tiny coops.

1646
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,880
Exactly.
What if you're like one of those dudes

1647
00:57:49,881 --> 00:57:51,430
that's backed up,
you don't even realize it.

1648
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:53,530
And you got like 20 pounds of on
digestive.

1649
00:57:53,531 --> 00:57:54,880
Is that the always the funny,
yeah.

1650
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:56,740
That's the thing that I like John Wayne
and stuff like that.

1651
00:57:56,741 --> 00:57:58,420
But what happens is,
what was the story?

1652
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:00,580
Oh well he died with a colon full of
stuff,

1653
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:02,170
but they said it'd be bowling ball.
Well,

1654
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:02,810
but I mean,
who knows?

1655
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,240
It's probably what it was.
It wasn't me.

1656
00:58:04,241 --> 00:58:04,720
You know,
look,

1657
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,270
look at this Joe.
If you go to the bathroom and you'd a

1658
00:58:07,271 --> 00:58:08,620
bunch of corn,
he looked down in there.

1659
00:58:08,621 --> 00:58:10,000
Sometimes there's some corn floating
around.

1660
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,890
When's the last time times.
Almost every time.

1661
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,220
When's the last time you saw a piece of
steak floating around in the toilet bone

1662
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:20,380
to bone that may have your eaten bombs
but meet this doesn't get there.

1663
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:20,911
I mean it's,
it's,

1664
00:58:20,911 --> 00:58:24,160
it's a total myth.
And so when we talk about what causes

1665
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:26,540
constipation is probably a neurologic
thing.

1666
00:58:26,541 --> 00:58:29,650
It's probably a neuromuscular thinks the
colon is not correct contracting

1667
00:58:29,651 --> 00:58:31,840
correctly.
It may have to do with electrolyte

1668
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,810
deficiency.
It certainly varies depending on my

1669
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:36,580
diet.
When I eat a lot of vegetables,

1670
00:58:36,581 --> 00:58:38,200
man,
it just comes flying out like,

1671
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,520
well it's because you just put more in
the right,

1672
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:41,650
so you're not constipated,
you're just,

1673
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,750
you're just putting your stuff and
you're just shoveling more stuff

1674
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:44,950
through.
The tube is sort of,

1675
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,470
but it seems like it comes out quicker.
Like when I drink.

1676
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,440
The craziest thing for sure for me is
Kale shakes.

1677
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,870
When I drink Kale shakes.
Woo.

1678
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:53,830
Hang on,
Hannah.

1679
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:54,970
Where are you getting about your,
I mean,

1680
00:58:54,971 --> 00:58:56,040
you're getting a bunch of,
you know,

1681
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:58,210
liquid fibers getting into your colon a
lot quick,

1682
00:58:58,211 --> 00:58:59,050
cleans it all out.

1683
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,610
It makes it feel good though.
It may be,

1684
00:59:00,611 --> 00:59:01,480
you know,
there's some people that do it,

1685
00:59:01,481 --> 00:59:04,140
but there's no real prize for the most.
But when you,

1686
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,860
at the end of your life,
you're not going to get an award for

1687
00:59:05,861 --> 00:59:07,570
more having more bowel moments.
You don't,

1688
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,340
you don't,
you don't shit.

1689
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:10,211
Yeah,
I,

1690
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:11,320
you sure?
Well,

1691
00:59:11,321 --> 00:59:13,030
I'm not 100% sure of,
but I'm not,

1692
00:59:13,031 --> 00:59:16,270
I'm not aware of so,
but that side too again.

1693
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:19,360
Um,
but most people think that just in all

1694
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,440
seriousness,
start seriousness that,

1695
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:24,470
that uh,
consuming fiber is important for like

1696
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:27,590
bowel movements and you overall
intestinal health and all that stuff.

1697
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,431
Yeah.
There's no doubt.

1698
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,160
The more fiber you eat,
the more battles you're going to have.

1699
00:59:30,161 --> 00:59:32,040
But what happens if you,
if you get constipated,

1700
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:34,160
and there's another study about this,
he looked at people with chronic

1701
00:59:34,161 --> 00:59:37,610
constipation that were always
constipated and the only thing that

1702
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:39,500
helped them was taking all fiber in
their diet,

1703
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,780
grilling and then there's a study.

1704
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,820
Uh,
but that's crazy because that's what

1705
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:46,730
people like mute.
What does that music is still,

1706
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:48,470
what does that stuff,
metamucil,

1707
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,390
metamucil.
Isn't that like,

1708
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:51,140
yeah,
it's fine.

1709
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,540
Yeah,
but what happens is what you have is you

1710
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:57,080
got a neuromuscular problem where the
colon is not contracting the right way

1711
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:00,260
and so you're blacked up and then you
just shove more fiber in there and it

1712
01:00:00,261 --> 01:00:02,510
just fills up more and more and
eventually just come.

1713
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,160
Maybe you might be the force it all
through,

1714
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,600
but,
but that's not,

1715
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,290
you know how that's,
you know,

1716
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:08,210
it's,
it's,

1717
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:11,390
a lot of people will say that.
I will tell you there was a lot of

1718
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:13,970
people that will tell me fiber just
jacks up their intestines.

1719
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,710
I mean,
they feel awful and they'd taken a lot

1720
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:18,500
of fiber.
I have heard that before.

1721
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:21,140
When people try five or supplements that
they have issues.

1722
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:26,740
Now do you very due lamb occasionally or
wild game or,

1723
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:27,651
yeah,
I mean,

1724
01:00:27,651 --> 01:00:28,850
depends what's available.
I mean,

1725
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:30,430
you know,
I'm pretty happy with,

1726
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,820
with uh,
with beef,

1727
01:00:31,821 --> 01:00:32,660
but I mean,
when I was,

1728
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,600
I was in France earlier this year and I
had just a bunch of lamb,

1729
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:35,991
you know,
that's,

1730
01:00:35,991 --> 01:00:37,280
that's easier to get.
I'll have,

1731
01:00:37,281 --> 01:00:39,110
sometimes they'll have chicken,
you know,

1732
01:00:39,111 --> 01:00:39,970
having a game.
Meanwhile,

1733
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:41,570
I wouldn't get any gaming since I've
started this,

1734
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,550
but I used to,
I've eaten elka foreign deer and you

1735
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:44,570
know,
Chili's and students,

1736
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:46,010
stuff like that.
So that's,

1737
01:00:46,011 --> 01:00:46,910
that's fine.
But I mean,

1738
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:48,650
but you don't necessarily eat a lot of
chicken hot.

1739
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:50,120
It's mostly red meat.
Yeah.

1740
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:51,130
I just find it,
I didn't,

1741
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,850
there's a lot of people like me to do
this.

1742
01:00:52,851 --> 01:00:54,980
They just find chicken is not as
satisfying.

1743
01:00:54,981 --> 01:00:56,600
It's just,
it's probably not as nutritious,

1744
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:57,620
you know?
It's just kind of like,

1745
01:00:57,621 --> 01:00:59,630
it doesn't feel as satisfying when
you're eating it.

1746
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,111
Yeah,
no,

1747
01:01:00,111 --> 01:01:01,220
that's it.
It's probably not,

1748
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,720
you know,
I think it's just harder to do that.

1749
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,870
I'm always trying to figure out like
what is that response that you get when

1750
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:08,700
you slice into a steak and it's juicy
and delicious and you're,

1751
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:10,430
your whole body goes,
oh,

1752
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,920
well I think that's,
you know,

1753
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:16,450
I think that's a primitive thing that
goes back a hundred thousand years.

1754
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,390
I mean,
that's like,

1755
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:19,970
that's like the point of,
you know,

1756
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:21,800
all it's hunting.
We did and it's just what,

1757
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:23,120
what,
what kind of satisfies?

1758
01:01:23,121 --> 01:01:26,220
It's why I always try to explain to
people that the difference between like

1759
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,320
domestic beef versus like a slice of
like Moose tenderloin,

1760
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:35,120
like the difference in the richness of
the flavor and the darkness of the meat

1761
01:01:35,121 --> 01:01:37,850
and the,
the nutrition content of the food is so

1762
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:41,270
much higher that the [inaudible] is
higher too.

1763
01:01:41,271 --> 01:01:42,650
Like the,
when you slice into and you're like,

1764
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,230
oh my God,
it just,

1765
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,090
your body's like that,
more of that.

1766
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:48,410
There we go.
That's what we're looking at.

1767
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:49,760
Media.
I think it's a primal thing.

1768
01:01:49,761 --> 01:01:52,130
I think it's just like,
this is satisfaction.

1769
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,240
I know really is.
Well,

1770
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:56,990
the Vegan army has a,
they've got their troops pointed in your

1771
01:01:56,991 --> 01:01:58,280
direction,
right?

1772
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,440
I'm sure.
Yeah.

1773
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,540
I mean,
I've got a bunch of tweets about you and

1774
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:04,010
one of the,
one of the tweets was,

1775
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:07,040
uh,
talking about your record as a doctor in

1776
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:09,370
New Mexico and stuff that you and I went
back and forth.

1777
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,010
Sure,
sure,

1778
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:11,030
sure.
So let's,

1779
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:15,540
let's like get that out and try to
figure out what the issue was.

1780
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:16,161
Sure.
All right.

1781
01:02:16,161 --> 01:02:17,570
So,
so,

1782
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,231
you know,
I was,

1783
01:02:18,231 --> 01:02:19,070
you know,
like I said,

1784
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,250
I'll just go to it,
my background

1785
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:20,791
a little bit.
So I,

1786
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:21,241
you know,
I go to,

1787
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:22,530
I go to medical school,
you know,

1788
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:25,920
I go to a degree in biology,
then I go to medical school,

1789
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,320
then I dropped out of medical school to
play professional rugby.

1790
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:29,310
You know,
I had just kind of a crazy,

1791
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:31,740
crazy career.
Then I go into the military and at

1792
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,870
launch nuclear bombs for,
you know,

1793
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:36,330
uh,
five years nuclear bombs.

1794
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,370
Yeah.
That was a nuclear bomb launch officer

1795
01:02:38,371 --> 01:02:40,740
for about five years.
Where do you still launched nuclear

1796
01:02:40,741 --> 01:02:41,670
bombs?
Well,

1797
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:44,940
I mean,
up in Wyoming and Nebraska and Colorado

1798
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:46,750
and their taxi detonate them.
No,

1799
01:02:46,751 --> 01:02:47,550
no.
That's where there,

1800
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:51,010
that's where you shoot them from
actually launch it.

1801
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:53,650
But you will work out.
And I was the guy that if we went to war

1802
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:57,050
and say Donald Trump says we want to
nuke North Korea out of and the guy goes

1803
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,180
moon,
it's a button.

1804
01:02:58,350 --> 01:02:59,310
So I did that.
So you know,

1805
01:02:59,311 --> 01:03:02,940
they do all this crazy psychological
screening to make sure you're not some

1806
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:03,780
psychopath,
you know,

1807
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:07,530
so I'm just like straight ethical guide.
It's dislike,

1808
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:09,270
you know,
you know a good,

1809
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:12,060
just a good solid guy that's a top
secret clearance and all that stuff.

1810
01:03:12,061 --> 01:03:15,210
So I do all this stuff.
So then I go play rugby and then I get

1811
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:16,440
tired of getting my head kicked in.
You know,

1812
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:17,850
I was playing,
you know,

1813
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,400
I remember my last match has plenty of
some Russian team I'm laying on the

1814
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:22,320
ground and it just cannot tee it off on
my head.

1815
01:03:22,321 --> 01:03:25,040
Kicking me in the head.
I got blood's coming out of my ears and

1816
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:26,220
I'm like,
I'm 30 years old.

1817
01:03:26,221 --> 01:03:28,050
I'm like F it,
I'm going to go back to medical school.

1818
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:30,660
So,
so I go back to medical school with the

1819
01:03:30,661 --> 01:03:32,100
military pays for it this time.

1820
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,030
So then,
you know,

1821
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:37,050
I do my time and you know,
go through to go through school and my

1822
01:03:37,051 --> 01:03:39,390
training and graduate top,
you know right at the top of my class in

1823
01:03:39,391 --> 01:03:41,250
medical school because getting
orthopedics,

1824
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:44,100
you gotta you gotta be like,
it's wanting to real competitive clc,

1825
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,470
you gotta be really at the top of the
class to do that.

1826
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:48,930
So I do that stuff,
do all my training,

1827
01:03:48,931 --> 01:03:50,400
bust my ass,
do really well,

1828
01:03:50,401 --> 01:03:53,460
get all these awards and train.
Then I get to in the military and then

1829
01:03:53,461 --> 01:03:54,660
they send me to war.
Right.

1830
01:03:54,661 --> 01:03:56,730
So they send me to Afghanistan and this
is,

1831
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,710
if it's okay,
I'll give it to tell you a little bit

1832
01:03:58,711 --> 01:04:00,390
about it.
So I'm,

1833
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,440
you know,
I come out of training,

1834
01:04:01,441 --> 01:04:03,060
not long was training and me and this
other dude,

1835
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:04,800
his name's Tom Large.
Excellent,

1836
01:04:04,801 --> 01:04:05,530
excellent surgeon.
Good.

1837
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:06,720
One of the,
just a great guy,

1838
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,290
great people.

1839
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:10,650
Me and him are the only two guys at the
main center in Afghanistan.

1840
01:04:10,651 --> 01:04:12,720
So you fly out there,
it takes you about three days.

1841
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,370
You go to Bangor,
Maine,

1842
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:16,740
and these old ladies give you lobster
bisque and away out.

1843
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:19,530
It's kind of cool.
Then you fly to Turkey and then we sat

1844
01:04:19,531 --> 01:04:22,440
there for like six hours on a runway,
wouldn't let us move,

1845
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,870
they wouldn't let us off the plane.
And then they fly into Kurdistan,

1846
01:04:24,871 --> 01:04:26,870
which is there used to be part of the
Soviet Union.

1847
01:04:26,871 --> 01:04:28,890
So Union.
So we've got a US base in what was

1848
01:04:28,891 --> 01:04:31,680
usually Soviet Union.
So we stayed there for one and it's

1849
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:33,210
freezing cold.
And then we,

1850
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:35,350
then we get on this c one 30 which is a
military plane.

1851
01:04:35,351 --> 01:04:36,810
You know,
you're packed in there with the cargo

1852
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,970
and you fly in Afghanistan and they're
shooting at just,

1853
01:04:38,971 --> 01:04:40,210
they turn off the lights so that,
you know,

1854
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,070
hopefully they don't hit you.

1855
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:42,120
They're shooting at,
you should come in.

1856
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:47,130
So we get in there and then I get off
the plane and they put you in this giant

1857
01:04:47,131 --> 01:04:50,000
hall with like 300 guys on cots first
night.

1858
01:04:50,001 --> 01:04:51,540
And then we go to the first day to go to
work.

1859
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:54,120
Right.
And we're taking over from the army and

1860
01:04:54,121 --> 01:04:56,550
I was in the air force at the time.
So we're taking over for the arm.

1861
01:04:56,551 --> 01:04:58,290
And the first thing that rolls in and
there's poor,

1862
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,310
I mean I remember this man,
it was,

1863
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:02,310
it was like welcome to fucking war.
There was a guy,

1864
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:06,210
Canadian guy who was 23 year old kid,
his special forces guy,

1865
01:05:06,211 --> 01:05:07,290
you know,
full beard.

1866
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:09,450
Cause you know the special forces guys
would wear beards cause it was so they

1867
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:10,284
could blend in,
right?

1868
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,110
Both legs blown right off.
I mean look like Holy Shit.

1869
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:13,951
You know.
So this is like,

1870
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:15,420
this is stuff discount real.

1871
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,620
So every day,
boom,

1872
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,041
boom,
boom,

1873
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:18,581
boom,
trunk.

1874
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,580
Crazy train.
We would get people blown up by bombs.

1875
01:05:21,581 --> 01:05:23,440
I mean their whole,
their legs are being on.

1876
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:24,880
I mean the second,
third day we got there,

1877
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:27,280
we had a kid,
he was a 17 year old kid in his anatomy.

1878
01:05:27,281 --> 01:05:28,570
We were taking care of enemies too,
right?

1879
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,240
He setting up a roadside bomb to kill
our guys.

1880
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:31,601
Right?
He's from,

1881
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:34,390
he's a 17 year old kid from Pakistan.
It blow,

1882
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:37,630
he blows himself up,
blows up both his legs above the knee,

1883
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,090
blows off one of his arm and most of his
hands.

1884
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:42,820
So he's basically,
I mean he's got nothing left,

1885
01:05:42,821 --> 01:05:45,490
some are operating on this guy.
We do all these operations is basically

1886
01:05:45,491 --> 01:05:47,680
saved the kid's life,
even though he's an enemy.

1887
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:48,820
Cause there's a physician,
you just,

1888
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,570
that's just your job.
So what happens to this guy?

1889
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,070
He said,
we fixed him up and takes us,

1890
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,740
you know,
month to get him stabilized and they

1891
01:05:56,741 --> 01:05:59,050
take them out the gate.
The Afghan army just goes and shoots him

1892
01:05:59,051 --> 01:06:01,570
in the head rail.
Fuck.

1893
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:02,591
You know,
we're like,

1894
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:04,120
what the hell are we doing here?
You know,

1895
01:06:04,121 --> 01:06:05,830
it's just like we're doing all this work
and he's gotten killed.

1896
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:08,410
These people,
they did that because they knew who he

1897
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,450
was.
They knew he was an enemy.

1898
01:06:10,451 --> 01:06:11,200
And so,
you know,

1899
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,060
they don't,
you know,

1900
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,570
I don't play games,
don't play games.

1901
01:06:13,571 --> 01:06:14,950
And so,
and this happened the other way too

1902
01:06:14,951 --> 01:06:16,840
around and we saw that seems like a lot
of wasted money.

1903
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:17,980
It is.
It's a waste.

1904
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:18,821
It's heartbreaking.
You know,

1905
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:20,500
you get in there and so we're getting,
I'm getting,

1906
01:06:20,501 --> 01:06:24,460
these people are blown up.
Our rockets are whole ways attached to,

1907
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,680
I mean,
even if it's the enemy,

1908
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:28,550
like you're in the military,
you're,

1909
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:31,030
you're working as a surgeon,
you're overseas,

1910
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,710
you're taken care of.

1911
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,230
I mean,
obviously it's a 17 year old kid.

1912
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:39,010
It's almost like Nadia is fall.
This is the thing.

1913
01:06:39,011 --> 01:06:39,610
I mean,
a lot of the,

1914
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:41,020
you know,
as a talent man at the time,

1915
01:06:41,021 --> 01:06:42,700
and these guys are like,
you know,

1916
01:06:42,701 --> 01:06:44,680
if you don't come fight for us,
we're going to kill your family.

1917
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:46,240
Right?
So a lot of these little kids are out

1918
01:06:46,241 --> 01:06:47,320
there,
dentists that they don't,

1919
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,720
that's not what they want to do.
It's not like to big guys.

1920
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,520
So you kind of do,
I mean it's like,

1921
01:06:51,521 --> 01:06:52,300
you know,
it's like,

1922
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,140
hey,
you know,

1923
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,720
it's not my job to punish these people.
It's my job to take care of these

1924
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:58,060
people.
So you there when they shot the kid or

1925
01:06:58,061 --> 01:06:59,410
did you see oh,
it is hard about it.

1926
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:00,161
We're like,
what happened to him?

1927
01:07:00,161 --> 01:07:00,994
Well,
you get killed,

1928
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,440
you know,
we heard about that.

1929
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,120
Several of our patients has happened is
it was pretty,

1930
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:04,780
pretty frustrating.

1931
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,520
So we get in there and there's like
people like,

1932
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:09,040
I mean little kids were getting these
little kids,

1933
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:10,630
two,
three year old kids stepping on

1934
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,250
landmines,
legs blown off.

1935
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:15,730
We had one little three year old kid.
I mean he was,

1936
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:18,940
I mean he was,
I mean somebody's drug him behind a

1937
01:07:18,941 --> 01:07:23,110
truck for like a mile and they drug this
kid through the streets to the rough

1938
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:25,870
asphalt street and it legs fucking
ripped off.

1939
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:29,590
I mean as kids road rash actually is,
the legs were ripped off.

1940
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:31,700
He was burned everywhere and we're in
her training and stuff.

1941
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,540
Why did they do that too?
I don't know.

1942
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:35,010
Just mad at their parents.
I Dunno.

1943
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,450
It's just this is not,
this is not a life friendly place,

1944
01:07:37,451 --> 01:07:38,060
right?
This is,

1945
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:40,840
life is inconsequential there.
There was a guy,

1946
01:07:40,841 --> 01:07:42,670
there was our art,
but we had a pediatrician who was

1947
01:07:42,671 --> 01:07:44,200
talking to this guy who was a farmer.

1948
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,080
Right.
And he was telling us about his tractor.

1949
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:48,610
Right.
He was real proud again to track cause

1950
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:50,290
real expensive to have a tractor in
there.

1951
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:53,350
So what he would do,
because tractors real valuable,

1952
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:56,390
he would have his kids walk in front of
the tractor so they didn't any

1953
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:58,450
landmines.
Oh my God.

1954
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,920
So if your kid had he,
he's like,

1955
01:07:59,921 --> 01:08:01,660
I can make another kid.
I can't afford it.

1956
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,680
This is the mentality there.
You know,

1957
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,440
it's just God,
Oh my God,

1958
01:08:08,441 --> 01:08:09,890
I can't even hear this.
I mean,

1959
01:08:09,891 --> 01:08:11,230
it's crazy stuff.
So we get into,

1960
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:14,020
imagine you have kids.
Could you imagine telling your fucking

1961
01:08:14,021 --> 01:08:16,220
kid to walk in front of landmines?
I can do it.

1962
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,031
I mean,
it would be,

1963
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:18,500
it would be,
it would be awful.

1964
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:21,780
Oh Jesus Christ.
So we get this stuff and then once,

1965
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,890
you know,
it just gets given gifts.

1966
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:23,810
This keeps getting worse.

1967
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:25,640
I mean,
it's like every day we get these people

1968
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:26,660
with,
you know,

1969
01:08:26,661 --> 01:08:28,910
they're blown up and you're looking at
their hip sock.

1970
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:29,811
No,
you let your,

1971
01:08:29,811 --> 01:08:31,860
like a guy's laying there was lake
completely gone.

1972
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:35,090
You can see a spine and his hip socket
day in and day out.

1973
01:08:35,091 --> 01:08:36,410
We're seeing this stuff.
We get,

1974
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:38,360
um,
we had,

1975
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:40,400
um,
this one we had,

1976
01:08:40,401 --> 01:08:42,470
so he's had some,
remember Dick Cheney was the vice

1977
01:08:42,471 --> 01:08:43,160
president,
right?

1978
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,650
Yeah.
So he flies into the base,

1979
01:08:45,651 --> 01:08:47,390
right?
And it was supposed to be secret.

1980
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:50,390
No ones wants to know about it,
but the Taliban guys found out about it,

1981
01:08:50,391 --> 01:08:53,930
right?
So what they do is they go to our gate,

1982
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,540
set off a suicide bomb,
and they just kill,

1983
01:08:57,170 --> 01:09:00,200
I mean,
tons of people and we get all of these

1984
01:09:00,201 --> 01:09:02,720
casualties and you know,
most of them are most immersive

1985
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:03,261
millions,
right?

1986
01:09:03,261 --> 01:09:04,850
So we get all of these civilian
casualties,

1987
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,920
little kids and adults,
you know,

1988
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,240
in their suicide vests.

1989
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,490
They put all these more,
you know,

1990
01:09:10,491 --> 01:09:11,750
like these metal bearings,
you know,

1991
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:15,320
like half inch thick metal bearing and
they cover him up and covering them

1992
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:17,690
shit.
So they get infected and they blow

1993
01:09:17,691 --> 01:09:18,441
through people.
I mean,

1994
01:09:18,441 --> 01:09:21,530
you get people with stuff going into
their brains and shattered bones

1995
01:09:21,531 --> 01:09:22,730
everywhere and all these people that are
just,

1996
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:24,470
you know,
dionysus chaos,

1997
01:09:24,471 --> 01:09:25,001
you know,
all these people,

1998
01:09:25,001 --> 01:09:26,600
you get swarmed in and we're getting
this stuff all the time.

1999
01:09:26,601 --> 01:09:29,750
This was the biggest one we had.
And so we were,

2000
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:31,580
I mean,
we literally 40 hours straight,

2001
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:32,271
you're working,
you know,

2002
01:09:32,271 --> 01:09:34,250
you're trying to save people's lives.
You know,

2003
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:36,410
I'm operating with a general surgeon
when people's bellies,

2004
01:09:36,411 --> 01:09:38,540
which I'm not trained to do,
but I'm just helping him trying to do

2005
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,790
this stuff.
So in the middle of this operation,

2006
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:42,470
we're in their operating,
you know,

2007
01:09:42,471 --> 01:09:43,690
take,
try and take care of these people in,

2008
01:09:43,691 --> 01:09:46,040
in Europe and in the operating room was
just a little,

2009
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,230
I mean,
it's like a little metal storage

2010
01:09:48,231 --> 01:09:48,771
building,
you know,

2011
01:09:48,771 --> 01:09:49,430
it's like a,
like a,

2012
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:50,930
like a little,
like if you're moving,

2013
01:09:50,931 --> 01:09:51,950
you know,
little pods things,

2014
01:09:51,951 --> 01:09:53,630
you know,
so they stick a couple of,

2015
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,040
uh,
uh,

2016
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:58,000
operating beds in there and we're going
as fast and we're wearing body armor and

2017
01:09:58,001 --> 01:10:00,470
we have nine millimeter strapped to us
and were operating,

2018
01:10:00,471 --> 01:10:02,060
you know,
it's hard to move around.

2019
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,520
It's real small.
And we're sitting in there and they say,

2020
01:10:04,521 --> 01:10:07,130
hey guys,
we think there's another bomber inside

2021
01:10:07,131 --> 01:10:09,350
the hospital,
you know,

2022
01:10:09,351 --> 01:10:10,970
in the hospital,
people off.

2023
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:12,560
So you're sitting there going,
you know,

2024
01:10:12,561 --> 01:10:13,970
your butthole tightens up and you're
like,

2025
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:15,260
well fuck,
I got to keep operating.

2026
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,310
You know,
cause I'm trying to save this guy's

2027
01:10:16,311 --> 01:10:18,050
life.
So we keep,

2028
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:19,760
we just like,
well we're going to go and we're going

2029
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:20,600
to go.
Right.

2030
01:10:20,601 --> 01:10:21,720
So we just keep,
you know,

2031
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:23,960
we keep operating.
Fortunately they didn't,

2032
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:25,640
they didn't,
they didn't find because they thought I

2033
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:27,350
did.
Somebody snuck in has a casualty.

2034
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:30,100
So they sometimes do that.
They blow people up and then they'd

2035
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:32,000
sneak in as a casualty and blow more
people.

2036
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,001
So it's like,
you know,

2037
01:10:35,001 --> 01:10:36,500
it's kind of freaky and so I,
you know,

2038
01:10:36,501 --> 01:10:38,770
I was like,
what an insane environment.

2039
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,460
How long were you there for?
Six months.

2040
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:42,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

2041
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,150
So that's,
I mean that's,

2042
01:10:44,151 --> 01:10:46,220
that's pretty crazy stuff.
So,

2043
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,140
you know,
we get out of there and you know,

2044
01:10:48,141 --> 01:10:50,360
I mean it was just,
it was just a email is a tremendous

2045
01:10:50,361 --> 01:10:51,590
experience.
I mean it was just like,

2046
01:10:51,591 --> 01:10:54,470
cause there was nothing I could see that
after that there was like,

2047
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,260
that ain't nothing.
Everything I saw after that,

2048
01:10:56,261 --> 01:10:58,250
another sergeant was like,
this is no big deal.

2049
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:01,280
Right.
So then I get out and then I,

2050
01:11:01,281 --> 01:11:02,300
you know,
get out of the military,

2051
01:11:02,301 --> 01:11:04,760
do another five years is taking care of
normal guys in the military.

2052
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:05,594
Right.
Didn't do it.

2053
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,160
You take your troops and stuff like
that.

2054
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,680
Doing fine.
I worked for all these other hospitals

2055
01:11:09,681 --> 01:11:10,220
and did fine.

2056
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,590
I never had any problems.
And then I get to this other hospital

2057
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,041
and I,
you know,

2058
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:16,110
I joined this group and they make me the
head of the group.

2059
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,760
Right.
What kind of group?

2060
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:19,380
It's just like an orthopedic surgery
group.

2061
01:11:19,381 --> 01:11:21,090
So,
and there when I got there,

2062
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:25,560
they were like two guys and they weren't
doing hardly any business at all.

2063
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:28,110
I was like really slow.
No one knew they were there.

2064
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,120
You know,
they were in part of his big huge group,

2065
01:11:30,121 --> 01:11:32,010
had all these other doctors,
but I didn't even know they existed.

2066
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:33,690
So I got there and I said,
well this is crap.

2067
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:36,060
And one of the reasons,
cause no one was seeing anything that

2068
01:11:36,061 --> 01:11:37,980
would refuse all these patients.
I got there and I said,

2069
01:11:37,981 --> 01:11:40,410
hey man,
I'm going to go talk to all these other

2070
01:11:40,411 --> 01:11:44,790
doctors and let him know we're alive,
that we're here and that we're going to

2071
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:47,320
see anything you want to send us and
we'll take care of it.

2072
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:48,930
If we can't,
we'll make sure it gets taken care of

2073
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:50,910
the right way.
So that happened and we started growing,

2074
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:54,120
right?
So we went from two guys to 12 guys and

2075
01:11:54,121 --> 01:11:55,860
about three years and so,
and we were very,

2076
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:59,370
very busy.
Real busy group in the rival group from

2077
01:11:59,371 --> 01:12:00,960
out of town,
from across the street.

2078
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:04,860
Didn't really like it that much because
we were taking millions of dollars from,

2079
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:06,900
I mean tens of millions of dollars in
their business,

2080
01:12:06,901 --> 01:12:09,240
right?
Cause it's orthopedic surgery is very,

2081
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:11,850
very lucrative for a hospital.
There's things like cardiology where

2082
01:12:11,851 --> 01:12:16,851
they're putting in stents and surgery.
All these procedure based practices make

2083
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,320
a lot of money for hospitals.
So they really like it,

2084
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,360
right?
So they're really happy and they're

2085
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:22,500
happy with me.
I'm like the,

2086
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:24,210
you know,
I'd like to hear them right?

2087
01:12:24,211 --> 01:12:24,841
Cause they're like,
man,

2088
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:27,450
you're making us a lot of money.
The group Cross town doesn't like me

2089
01:12:27,451 --> 01:12:29,150
very much because I'm taking all their
money away.

2090
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,710
So they approached us and they said,
you know,

2091
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:33,510
why don't you join our group and you'll,
you know,

2092
01:12:33,511 --> 01:12:34,470
we'll take care of.
And I said,

2093
01:12:34,471 --> 01:12:35,430
no,
I don't want to do that.

2094
01:12:35,431 --> 01:12:36,930
And,
but to my partners did,

2095
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,820
they eventually left.
So I'm the only holdout guy,

2096
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:41,010
but I'm still going up.
So building the group.

2097
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:43,290
And so I'm like the head,
I'm like the head of the snake,

2098
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:44,124
the rival.
Right.

2099
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,590
But here's what kind of happened.
So I'm busy,

2100
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,120
I'm doing well,
my patients are happy,

2101
01:12:48,121 --> 01:12:50,310
I'm doing really well.
I've got low real low complication

2102
01:12:50,311 --> 01:12:51,770
rates,
you know,

2103
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:52,980
you know,
everybody's,

2104
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,360
you know,
I'm very popular.

2105
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:55,520
You know,
I'm on billboards,

2106
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:58,020
I'm on magazines,
I'm on radios,

2107
01:12:58,380 --> 01:12:58,961
you know,
I'm,

2108
01:12:58,961 --> 01:12:59,331
I'm,
you know,

2109
01:12:59,331 --> 01:13:00,164
I'm just,
I'm just there.

2110
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,350
Posterboard basically.
Right?

2111
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:06,360
So then as I found with my diet,
I started seeing patients getting better

2112
01:13:06,361 --> 01:13:07,350
by just changing her diet.

2113
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,640
And when you look in the orthopedics,
you know,

2114
01:13:09,641 --> 01:13:11,040
like bone disease,
like arthritis,

2115
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:13,260
there's nothing about died in there.
I mean,

2116
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:15,960
you were studying about it.
If somebody comes into your office,

2117
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:17,430
you know,
you'll tell him,

2118
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,620
you know,
we can give you some tylenol,

2119
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,960
we can give them you some,
uh,

2120
01:13:21,961 --> 01:13:23,940
you know,
and other anti inflammatory drug we can,

2121
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,360
we can sit some cortisone in your knee.
You know,

2122
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:27,360
if that doesn't work,
maybe we'll,

2123
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:28,560
you know,
we'll fence to send you to physical

2124
01:13:28,561 --> 01:13:30,630
therapy.
We might put a scope in there and have

2125
01:13:30,631 --> 01:13:31,940
none of that works,
you know,

2126
01:13:31,941 --> 01:13:33,390
and it,
this is an end stage and we're going to

2127
01:13:33,391 --> 01:13:34,350
replace your knee.
Right.

2128
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,510
So what I was finding,
you know,

2129
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:40,290
as I started doing this with patients is
that these patients are getting better

2130
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:42,210
just by changing or not putting him on a
ketogenic diet.

2131
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:43,470
I was,
at that time I was doing Quito.

2132
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:44,820
So I was like,
hey man,

2133
01:13:44,821 --> 01:13:46,800
try this.
So mine in my nurse and I had this,

2134
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:48,120
and this is one of the things that kind
of,

2135
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:52,260
I'm very jaded about the way the
business side of medicine is.

2136
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,160
Now,
this has been a pretty,

2137
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,020
pretty interesting experience for me.
So I had a nurse,

2138
01:13:55,021 --> 01:13:57,780
it was just,
I mean she was a wonderful person.

2139
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:00,090
I mean the nicest,
sweetest gal in the world.

2140
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,340
She would work so hard for these
patients.

2141
01:14:02,341 --> 01:14:03,081
You take care of,
you know,

2142
01:14:03,081 --> 01:14:04,350
anything you need done,
you tell her,

2143
01:14:04,351 --> 01:14:06,240
hey take care.
And she was just awesome,

2144
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:09,180
right?
The hospital said you're staying in too

2145
01:14:09,181 --> 01:14:10,560
late and we're having to pay you over
time.

2146
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:11,140
And she's like,
well,

2147
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,380
taking care of patients.
Well we don't care who,

2148
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:14,260
I don't want you to work late because it
costs us too much money.

2149
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:16,450
So it was just like,
it was of these things where you're

2150
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:17,410
starting to see that,
you know,

2151
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,270
it's all about the money.
And then we were like,

2152
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:21,910
so all these surgeons,
as a surgeon,

2153
01:14:21,911 --> 01:14:23,800
you get used to using certain equipment,
you know,

2154
01:14:23,801 --> 01:14:24,810
it's like,
you know,

2155
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:26,800
I'm using this particular thing,
have to replace people,

2156
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:29,230
joints and you do it for years and years
and years and you get pretty good at it.

2157
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:31,450
And so at the hospital said is,
hey,

2158
01:14:31,451 --> 01:14:34,120
we got a bargain deal with this other
company so your guys are going to use

2159
01:14:34,121 --> 01:14:35,310
that.
You know?

2160
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:35,861
We're like,
no,

2161
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:37,090
we don't want to use that.
We've learned how to do this,

2162
01:14:37,091 --> 01:14:40,300
won't even how to use that stuff.
So they force everybody to do this,

2163
01:14:40,301 --> 01:14:41,050
you know,
just to say,

2164
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:43,390
you know what,
some new surgical equipment,

2165
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:44,224
is that what you're saying?
Yeah.

2166
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,060
Well basically you know there's a
system,

2167
01:14:46,061 --> 01:14:48,190
it's like if you drive a Ford truck your
whole life,

2168
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:50,140
you know they are,
I understand what you're saying.

2169
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:51,011
And then they say,
no,

2170
01:14:51,011 --> 01:14:52,090
you're going to grab Chevy now.
Right,

2171
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:53,840
but this is surgical.
This is third semester.

2172
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:56,380
This is sort of the whole reason is that
we're going to save me money.

2173
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:59,310
All the scraps were pitching.
The ones guys were already using them.

2174
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:00,520
I don't care,
and this is the other group.

2175
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,530
We don't care.
But our group was like,

2176
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:03,940
we don't,
we use this stuff,

2177
01:15:03,941 --> 01:15:04,331
man.
It's,

2178
01:15:04,331 --> 01:15:05,680
it's stuff.
We don't even know how to use this guy.

2179
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,360
You're not adapting,
you're not adapting.

2180
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:09,040
You're going to compromise patient care
a little bit.

2181
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:10,360
For this.
So yeah,

2182
01:15:10,361 --> 01:15:12,670
this is one of those things where I,
and I was very vocal against this.

2183
01:15:12,671 --> 01:15:13,390
I was like,
man,

2184
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:13,841
I don't,
you know,

2185
01:15:13,841 --> 01:15:15,350
this is [inaudible],
this is,

2186
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:17,590
this is what we're trained on.
You know,

2187
01:15:17,591 --> 01:15:19,060
we're gonna,
we're gonna end up,

2188
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,140
um,
you know,

2189
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:21,310
there's,
there's gonna be patients are going to

2190
01:15:21,311 --> 01:15:22,720
be problematic from this stuff.

2191
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:26,980
So that was an aside thing.
And then there was a system where it's

2192
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,240
another thing they put in the,
the,

2193
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:29,380
you know,
this is the one thing that all

2194
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:31,690
physicians hate this thing called an
electronic medical record.

2195
01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:34,750
He was a computer based record.
Not that it's a computer based thing,

2196
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:37,660
but they're awful.
I mean they sit there and their main

2197
01:15:37,661 --> 01:15:40,810
function is to collect billing and to do
coding.

2198
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:43,930
So it's a capture as much information as
you can so you can build more.

2199
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:44,441
Right.
That's,

2200
01:15:44,441 --> 01:15:47,140
that's you know why hospital and liked
them.

2201
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:49,840
So they puts us on you and it's like,
you know,

2202
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,370
no,
it's like really hard to take,

2203
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:53,290
you know,
to put good information there.

2204
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:55,760
Cause all it is to generate a bunch of
data that's totally illogical.

2205
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:56,291
You know,
you can't,

2206
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:59,430
you look at it,
it's like you get 20 pages of Bs and

2207
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:00,940
two,
two paragraphs of stuff you need.

2208
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:02,170
Right?
So where did it all go bad?

2209
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,200
So then we,
so basically what happened is when I

2210
01:16:05,201 --> 01:16:08,140
started telling peach people I don't
want to,

2211
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:08,950
you know,
I'm tardy,

2212
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:10,690
I started talking to people out of
surgery,

2213
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,460
right?
I started saying,

2214
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:15,070
I don't think you need surgery.
And then I started talking to the

2215
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,270
administrators and say,
hey guys,

2216
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:20,800
I really want to spend a day a week just
doing lifestyle counseling.

2217
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:21,760
I don't want to,
you know,

2218
01:16:21,761 --> 01:16:23,340
I don't want to,
you know,

2219
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,750
constantly do this cause I think this
can work resentful.

2220
01:16:25,751 --> 01:16:28,390
You making the cutting motion like it's
costly surgery.

2221
01:16:28,391 --> 01:16:28,930
Right?
And so,

2222
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:30,070
and they are basically said,
no,

2223
01:16:30,071 --> 01:16:31,960
there's no appetite for that.
Your skill as a surgeon,

2224
01:16:31,961 --> 01:16:32,890
we want you there.
And you know,

2225
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:34,840
in other words,
keep making us a lot of money,

2226
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:36,370
right?
So I'm like,

2227
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,420
you know,
you know,

2228
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:38,980
and,
and my nurse will take him and I was

2229
01:16:38,981 --> 01:16:41,890
printing out,
I made a list of all his reading.

2230
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:42,551
You remember,
like Gary,

2231
01:16:42,551 --> 01:16:43,840
I know he had,
Gary Thompson denied,

2232
01:16:43,841 --> 01:16:47,730
had his book and I had Nina Teicholz his
book on and I had just got him

2233
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,030
butterball up rigs,
you know,

2234
01:16:49,031 --> 01:16:51,160
all these key to Janneke things,
references.

2235
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:54,580
And I was handing them out 2025 of those
every single day.

2236
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,350
And I was spending time with the
patients,

2237
01:16:56,351 --> 01:16:57,550
you know,
because normally you'd only get like

2238
01:16:57,551 --> 01:16:59,020
eight,
eight minutes to see a patient,

2239
01:16:59,021 --> 01:16:59,980
you know,
figured out the problem,

2240
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,390
figuring out a plan and go,
go,

2241
01:17:01,391 --> 01:17:02,224
go.
And I was like,

2242
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,720
now spending 20 minutes talking to these
guys about diet.

2243
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:05,741
And so,
you know,

2244
01:17:05,741 --> 01:17:07,780
then I'm seeing less patients in the
hospital keeps saying,

2245
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,520
you know,
you know,

2246
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:10,790
we don't want,
we don't really like that.

2247
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:16,130
So because I was ahead of the group and
I was well liked by everybody,

2248
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:18,350
I had really good patient records.
I mean,

2249
01:17:18,351 --> 01:17:19,430
really good,
uh,

2250
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:20,740
patient satisfaction.

2251
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:23,120
You'll really low complication rates.
I mean,

2252
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:23,954
they were,
they're like,

2253
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:24,801
well,
we don't like that.

2254
01:17:24,801 --> 01:17:27,110
So then they go,
there's something called Peer Review,

2255
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:28,760
right?
So they can just pull your records and

2256
01:17:28,761 --> 01:17:31,010
say,
we don't like the way you did this.

2257
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:33,020
And you know,
we're gonna,

2258
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:33,891
we're gonna,
we're gonna,

2259
01:17:33,891 --> 01:17:37,310
we're gonna criticize your work.
And so they did that and they went

2260
01:17:37,311 --> 01:17:39,080
through there.
And this is one of the things they said,

2261
01:17:39,081 --> 01:17:42,050
well,
every surgeon will have x amount of

2262
01:17:42,051 --> 01:17:42,950
complications,
right?

2263
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:43,671
It's like,
you know,

2264
01:17:43,671 --> 01:17:45,110
if you do,
uh,

2265
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:47,540
you know,
a hundred surgeries,

2266
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,090
about 5% of the time there's going to be
some complications.

2267
01:17:50,091 --> 01:17:53,110
Somebody is going to get an infection,
some he's going to bleed too much.

2268
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,970
I'm just gonna get a blood clot off as
an orthopedic surgeon.

2269
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,680
Maybe one of the screws you put in
breaks or something.

2270
01:17:57,681 --> 01:18:00,470
Like those things are all complication
that happens to everybody no matter

2271
01:18:00,471 --> 01:18:01,304
what.

2272
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:05,030
So what they said is there,
there's a low threshold,

2273
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:05,990
right?
There's like a,

2274
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:08,030
you know,
we're going to say every year we're

2275
01:18:08,031 --> 01:18:10,730
going to give you two complications that
were your fault,

2276
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,170
right?
Cause most of the time you have a

2277
01:18:12,171 --> 01:18:13,500
complication.
It's like mentors,

2278
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:15,650
nothing.
I could've done equipment failure or

2279
01:18:15,651 --> 01:18:16,251
slow,
they'll say,

2280
01:18:16,251 --> 01:18:18,060
you made the wrong decision.
That liberal complicates.

2281
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,940
So they'll say you can get to a year,
right.

2282
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:24,650
And it doesn't matter if you do a
hundred surgeries a year or you do 500

2283
01:18:24,651 --> 01:18:26,510
surgeries a year,
the numbers still too.

2284
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:27,920
Right.
And I'm like,

2285
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:29,441
you know,
cause I,

2286
01:18:29,441 --> 01:18:32,120
cause I was there for like five years
and like every year was like one,

2287
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:32,781
one,
one,

2288
01:18:32,781 --> 01:18:34,180
one,
just nothing minimal.

2289
01:18:34,181 --> 01:18:35,210
Right.
One year,

2290
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:37,160
one year they go back,
so you had three this year?

2291
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,001
I'm like,
yeah,

2292
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:40,160
but I did five times as many surgeries
than anybody else.

2293
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:41,420
And I said,
well it doesn't matter.

2294
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:42,830
We're going to work and still put it
through peer review.

2295
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,800
So what they do is they hire,
I remember this other group that I was

2296
01:18:45,801 --> 01:18:48,320
pissing off and it's taken $10 million a
year from,

2297
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:51,680
they hire their guy,
that guy to look through my stuff.

2298
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:54,200
Why would they do that?
Because that's what they wanted to do.

2299
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:57,560
But why would they do that if that
person on that other side is the

2300
01:18:57,561 --> 01:19:00,290
competition?
Because he was in the position to do it.

2301
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:01,100
Right.
Okay.

2302
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,780
So,
and that's not supposed to have it.

2303
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:05,720
It'd be like if you were a ability for
guy and said,

2304
01:19:05,721 --> 01:19:07,940
I want the Bella tour guide to review
the UFC.

2305
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,490
Right?
I think Joe Rogan sucks is an announcer.

2306
01:19:10,491 --> 01:19:12,620
I'm have a billet military guy go after
him,

2307
01:19:12,621 --> 01:19:14,480
right?
So it's total conflict of interest,

2308
01:19:14,481 --> 01:19:15,470
right?
So I,

2309
01:19:15,471 --> 01:19:16,071
you know,
I'm in,

2310
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:18,590
I'm like this naive ethical guide.

2311
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:19,161
It's like,
well,

2312
01:19:19,161 --> 01:19:22,040
you know,
I know I could care and reasons for

2313
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:23,960
doing fine.
And then,

2314
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:25,430
um,
you know,

2315
01:19:25,431 --> 01:19:26,241
I was just like,
okay,

2316
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:26,841
well,
okay,

2317
01:19:26,841 --> 01:19:28,960
that's fine.
And so they get it back and the guy,

2318
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,250
and they looked at,
they looked at a dozen cases or they've

2319
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:31,801
selected,
you know,

2320
01:19:31,801 --> 01:19:33,380
so like you pick whatever they want.
And they said,

2321
01:19:33,381 --> 01:19:34,220
well,
he said,

2322
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,260
I think six these cases were below
average.

2323
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:37,580
You know,
I don't like the way you documented

2324
01:19:37,581 --> 01:19:39,140
stuff and this and I disagree what you
did.

2325
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:40,221
So I'm like,
fine.

2326
01:19:40,221 --> 01:19:40,851
They said,
well,

2327
01:19:40,851 --> 01:19:41,900
that's okay.
You know,

2328
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:43,250
um,
you know,

2329
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:44,001
you're fine.
I said,

2330
01:19:44,001 --> 01:19:45,540
what do I need to stop operating?
Someone who said,

2331
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:45,921
no,
no,

2332
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:46,340
no,
no,

2333
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,340
you're fine.
Well,

2334
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,490
we're gonna do is we're going to get an
independent review,

2335
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,590
right?
And this is supposed to be someone with

2336
01:19:51,591 --> 01:19:53,030
no conflicts of interest,
right?

2337
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:58,630
So the way this this is supposed to
happen is that they were supposed to let

2338
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:02,450
me see what the cases are and put my
comments in there,

2339
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,580
right.
And they were supposedly supposed to be

2340
01:20:04,581 --> 01:20:07,160
totally in.
So what they did and did instead is they

2341
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,130
wouldn't let me know any

2342
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:11,280
of the cases.
They told me you can't see anything.

2343
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:14,850
Right.
And the guy that had the conflicts of

2344
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:17,880
interest that gave him all of his
findings and send them to this guy.

2345
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:19,890
Right.
And this guy and I,

2346
01:20:19,891 --> 01:20:20,491
and I,
you know,

2347
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:21,750
I don't know the situation where this
guy,

2348
01:20:21,751 --> 01:20:24,120
but you know,
I found this out about six months later,

2349
01:20:24,121 --> 01:20:27,150
he is either senile or totally drunk.
I mean it was just like,

2350
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,100
you know,
so he gets this report,

2351
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:30,390
right?
And it's just bad.

2352
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:33,240
It's like,
it looks really bad and I'll talk about

2353
01:20:33,241 --> 01:20:35,490
some of the details in a second,
but it just looks really bad.

2354
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:37,290
And they come,
they pull me in the office and say,

2355
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,390
we got this really bad enough
independent report,

2356
01:20:39,391 --> 01:20:41,370
right?
And I'm like,

2357
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:44,040
well,
what cases where we can't tell you but

2358
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:46,320
it's really bad and we're going to,
we're going to suspend you privileges.

2359
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,490
We're not gonna let you work here
anymore.

2360
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:50,760
So essentially what you're trying to say
is they targeted you and they targeted

2361
01:20:50,761 --> 01:20:54,510
you because you were changing what you
were doing and you were trying to

2362
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:59,540
counsel people with lifestyle and they
decided to pick on you and try to find

2363
01:21:00,361 --> 01:21:03,210
things that were wrong.
And some of the past surgeries that you

2364
01:21:03,211 --> 01:21:04,890
do.
I think it was a combination.

2365
01:21:04,891 --> 01:21:06,260
I think there was a combination of
income,

2366
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,590
no problems.
We're not,

2367
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:09,030
some people weren't doing it
intentionally,

2368
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,910
but there were,
there was definitely a,

2369
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,780
possibly some of the,
some of that going on.

2370
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:17,460
But anyway,
so they get this report and the guy,

2371
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:18,271
there's,
there's two people,

2372
01:21:18,271 --> 01:21:20,040
they bring me in the office say,
you know,

2373
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:21,840
we're going to shut down.
You can't go to your clinic.

2374
01:21:21,841 --> 01:21:24,890
You can't talk to anybody you work with.
We're going to deny you access to all

2375
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:25,733
clinic charts.

2376
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:27,840
We're going to shut off your email.
You can't look at anything.

2377
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:29,010
Right?
Like,

2378
01:21:29,011 --> 01:21:30,150
um,
like I just committed murder.

2379
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:33,600
Like I'm some pariah and then they say,
then the guy and I'm like,

2380
01:21:33,601 --> 01:21:34,434
you know,
I'm like,

2381
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,530
I mean it's like something like kid just
died.

2382
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,310
I mean,
this is something I spent my whole life

2383
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:39,930
training for.
You know,

2384
01:21:39,931 --> 01:21:42,120
I'm doing this stuff.
And it's like,

2385
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:43,650
you know,
I mean,

2386
01:21:43,651 --> 01:21:45,730
it's like you're like days and
confusion,

2387
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:46,490
numb.
I mean,

2388
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:47,520
I'm like numb.
I'm like,

2389
01:21:47,521 --> 01:21:48,354
I don't know.
I'm like,

2390
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:51,150
I'm like,
I'm going to drive my fucking car off a

2391
01:21:51,151 --> 01:21:51,781
cliff.
You know,

2392
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:53,310
you're like suicidal almost,
you know?

2393
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,260
So the guy comes to me and he goes,
hey man,

2394
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:57,660
we got this really bad stuff on you is
going to go really bad.

2395
01:21:57,661 --> 01:21:59,310
We're going to take it to a committee
and a couple of days.

2396
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,770
And I think the best thing you can do is
just say,

2397
01:22:01,771 --> 01:22:02,880
you're sorry,
write a letter.

2398
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,770
I'll even help you write this letter.
You know,

2399
01:22:04,771 --> 01:22:05,810
basically say,
confess it to you,

2400
01:22:05,811 --> 01:22:07,500
did the wrong thing.
So I'm like,

2401
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:09,480
I didn't,
I didn't have a lawyer at the time and

2402
01:22:09,481 --> 01:22:10,291
didn't know what's going on.
So I said,

2403
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:11,101
okay,
I'll do this.

2404
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:13,230
And so I write this letter saying,
yeah,

2405
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:15,030
you know,
I probably could have done no stuff

2406
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:16,220
different.
I Dunno what the cases were,

2407
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:19,590
but probably,
and so you're saying this without even

2408
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,200
have reviewed the cases that they're
condemning you on?

2409
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:24,480
Absolutely,
because I was fuck did you not get a

2410
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:26,070
lawyer?
I did afterwards,

2411
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,420
but I don't know.
Cause I know,

2412
01:22:27,421 --> 01:22:29,430
you know,
I'd been a straight laced ethical guy my

2413
01:22:29,431 --> 01:22:32,040
whole life.
So when you did afterwards the lawyer go

2414
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:35,160
back and look at that,
the confession or whatever you would

2415
01:22:35,161 --> 01:22:36,100
call it,
she says,

2416
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:39,300
well this is preposterous because you're
not even talking about a specific case.

2417
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:41,740
Well she said it was probably something
he shouldn't have done and I would have

2418
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:44,220
Kelsey,
but this guy was on the committee that

2419
01:22:44,221 --> 01:22:45,310
condemn me.
Right?

2420
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,220
So this is a guy that's honestly,
they set you up.

2421
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:50,400
So in some ways,
so this is what I want to say that

2422
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:51,900
because you still wanting to be a
doctor.

2423
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:52,920
Well,
so this is,

2424
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:56,010
um,
so basically they'd take this committee,

2425
01:22:56,011 --> 01:22:57,900
right?
And they hand this report.

2426
01:22:58,110 --> 01:23:00,480
It says all this bad stuff and the hand,
my confession,

2427
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:01,510
right.
And this is all I,

2428
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:02,940
this is basically what they have to go
on.

2429
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,010
No one knows anything about the cases.
And this

2430
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,170
is all these people that are doctors,
but they're not surgeons.

2431
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:09,370
Right.
All they are is,

2432
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:12,130
it would be like if you were reviewing
mma guys,

2433
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:13,840
like,
so let's say you want to kick somebody

2434
01:23:13,841 --> 01:23:16,510
out of the UFC because you said it's
performance isn't up to snuff.

2435
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:19,600
And you went to a much a tennis players
and golfers and said,

2436
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,620
hey man,
we don't think he hasn't his take 10% it

2437
01:23:22,621 --> 01:23:24,180
sucks.
And I see what I'm saying.

2438
01:23:24,181 --> 01:23:26,120
So these people have no frigging clue,
right?

2439
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,720
They have no clue about what I did.
They don't have specific cases to go

2440
01:23:29,721 --> 01:23:31,690
specific cases.
And I'm not allowed to talk about this

2441
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:35,230
cause I don't know the specific cases.
So then I railroad job.

2442
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,990
So,
so then I,

2443
01:23:37,991 --> 01:23:38,361
you know,
I,

2444
01:23:38,361 --> 01:23:40,450
I kind of will come out of this haze and
I looked and I said,

2445
01:23:40,451 --> 01:23:41,980
we'll give you a fair hearing.

2446
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:45,160
Says what they call it.
A fear of federal law requires us to

2447
01:23:45,161 --> 01:23:46,360
give you a fair hearing.
Right?

2448
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:50,170
So I get a lawyer and this is expensive
as shit,

2449
01:23:50,171 --> 01:23:50,730
you know,
I'm not,

2450
01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:52,620
I don't have an income anymore.
So I'm spending all this money in the

2451
01:23:52,621 --> 01:23:55,870
lawyers fees and it's taken the hospital
to drags out.

2452
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:58,030
They won't release records for like six
months.

2453
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:01,540
So six months goes by.
I mean here I got four small kids.

2454
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:02,890
I'm like,
fuck,

2455
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:05,350
am I going to feed my kid?
My kids are in school like one autistic

2456
01:24:05,351 --> 01:24:07,510
son and he's therapy and you know,
this is,

2457
01:24:07,511 --> 01:24:08,510
this is tough,
you know,

2458
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,840
so going through this stuff,
so six months ago,

2459
01:24:10,841 --> 01:24:13,570
the layer and then I finally get the
cases right and I started looking

2460
01:24:13,571 --> 01:24:15,070
through the cases and what the guy
wrote.

2461
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,780
And not only are there errors,
there are egregious errors and there's

2462
01:24:19,781 --> 01:24:21,340
multiple when they're just horrible.

2463
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:22,990
I mean,
they're just so wrong.

2464
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:23,330
I mean,
I,

2465
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:25,240
that's why I said the guy has seen her
drunk.

2466
01:24:25,241 --> 01:24:28,420
I'll give you a couple of examples and
any orthopedic surgeons is listening to

2467
01:24:28,421 --> 01:24:30,160
us know immediately what I'm talking
about.

2468
01:24:30,161 --> 01:24:31,840
But I'll try and make it make sense for
other people.

2469
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,810
So the of these 12 cases,
two of them were something called a

2470
01:24:34,811 --> 01:24:37,000
reverse shoulder replacement.
So what happens is,

2471
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:38,350
you know,
if you showed a word's out,

2472
01:24:38,351 --> 01:24:39,760
you can replace your shoulder,
right?

2473
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:43,540
Just shoulder replacements on people.
What do you put in there?

2474
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:45,460
Like some sort of an artificial joint.
Yeah.

2475
01:24:45,461 --> 01:24:47,230
So then this is,
what is this what I'm talking about

2476
01:24:47,231 --> 01:24:48,970
some,
normally it's a ball and socket joint,

2477
01:24:48,971 --> 01:24:50,150
right?
So there's something called a reverse

2478
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:52,580
shoulder replacement,
which you basically switch it around and

2479
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:55,630
you put the ball where the socket was
and the socket where the ball was,

2480
01:24:55,631 --> 01:24:57,250
which sounds totally crazy,
right?

2481
01:24:57,910 --> 01:25:01,750
This was developed in France in the 80s
and then the FDA approved this in 2004

2482
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:06,010
it's a 2004 was approved in the u s and
originally it was approved for one

2483
01:25:06,011 --> 01:25:06,791
reason,
right?

2484
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:10,270
If your shoulder is totally arthritic,
you know,

2485
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:12,040
real bad,
Arthur and you don't have a rotator cuff

2486
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:13,930
anymore and it's completely gone.
Right?

2487
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:15,910
So that's what it was first approved
for.

2488
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:18,130
But over the years,
over the next five,

2489
01:25:18,131 --> 01:25:19,960
10 years,
people started using it for all these

2490
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:21,040
other things.
And getting really,

2491
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:23,930
really good results with it.
So if you come in there with a blasted

2492
01:25:23,931 --> 01:25:25,630
apart shoulder that's crashed and
broken,

2493
01:25:25,631 --> 01:25:28,150
you're an older person.
People do that all the time.

2494
01:25:28,151 --> 01:25:29,200
And so that's,
that's what I did.

2495
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:31,150
I basically put a noise,
you know,

2496
01:25:31,151 --> 01:25:33,610
reverse shoulder and a person that broke
their arm at this twice.

2497
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:37,840
And not only did the patient do well,
I mean the patient was happy as can be.

2498
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,680
They're great.
They're like,

2499
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:40,900
no one knew what the outcomes of these
patients in this patient is.

2500
01:25:40,901 --> 01:25:44,020
Happy as can be.
But the guy writes because he's old,

2501
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:46,120
I think,
or drunk or doesn't know the new record.

2502
01:25:46,121 --> 01:25:48,340
He hasn't read literature and 10 he put
it in backwards.

2503
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:49,390
No,
he puts,

2504
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:51,580
it's not indicated for this student.
The only reason to do,

2505
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:54,910
and it's for an arthritic guy with a,
with a missing road ticket.

2506
01:25:54,911 --> 01:25:56,560
But he doesn't know that over the last
10 years,

2507
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:58,180
all kinds of different reasons to use
it.

2508
01:25:58,181 --> 01:26:02,800
So he basically tells us committee he's
doing the wrong operation when anybody

2509
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:05,150
denay that that's not the case.
Right.

2510
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,250
So there's another case.
It a guy.

2511
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:07,760
No,
it's okay.

2512
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,650
We don't have to keep just going over
case after case.

2513
01:26:09,651 --> 01:26:10,960
It's going to get a little dragon.
I know,

2514
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:13,310
but what,
where does it stand right now?

2515
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:17,540
So basically what happens is,
so they drag us out for a year and a

2516
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:18,230
half,
right?

2517
01:26:18,230 --> 01:26:19,880
And they finally,
you know,

2518
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:20,661
and at the end,
you know,

2519
01:26:20,661 --> 01:26:23,030
I tell him,
cause I gotta tell you this part,

2520
01:26:23,031 --> 01:26:26,060
so I go through,
this is important.

2521
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,040
I go through and compile all of these
cases,

2522
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:30,050
right?
And get all the data to refute this and

2523
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:32,540
pull all these references and textbooks
and all this stuff.

2524
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:34,430
And I'm like,
this is a walk in the park,

2525
01:26:34,431 --> 01:26:35,264
right?
I'm going to,

2526
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:36,531
uh,
you know,

2527
01:26:36,531 --> 01:26:39,260
anybody that sees us in the right mind
is going to see that they screwed up and

2528
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:43,160
there's all these Arabs that's wrong.
So I see in discovery process,

2529
01:26:43,161 --> 01:26:45,380
you send all this information in and
then they fail.

2530
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:46,880
Then they realize that,
wait a minute,

2531
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:50,210
there's a lot of Eric's in here.
So now they have to pick a hearing

2532
01:26:50,211 --> 01:26:51,260
officer,
right?

2533
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:52,820
Who's like the judge,
right?

2534
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:53,980
His word goes to,
they pick it up,

2535
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:56,720
they get another search,
like give me a list of surgeons to

2536
01:26:56,721 --> 01:26:57,640
choose from.
He said,

2537
01:26:57,641 --> 01:27:00,200
you can have any of these guys you want.
And I looked through the list and

2538
01:27:00,201 --> 01:27:02,510
there's one guy,
you remember that group that I was

2539
01:27:02,511 --> 01:27:04,940
competing with,
he's in that group and I'm like,

2540
01:27:04,941 --> 01:27:06,950
I don't want him cause he's on the other
group.

2541
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:07,911
And they said,
no,

2542
01:27:07,911 --> 01:27:11,630
he just retired and we went and we're
going to make you use him.

2543
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,750
Right?
So they pick the judge and then on top

2544
01:27:14,751 --> 01:27:18,110
of that they pay him.
So they're paying this guy,

2545
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,790
right.
So they review all this stuff and I've

2546
01:27:19,791 --> 01:27:21,980
got this stuff and I'm going through
case after case where I'm like,

2547
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:24,470
the patient didn't get,
the patient was doing great,

2548
01:27:24,471 --> 01:27:26,210
they didn't get hurt.
There's nothing wrong with them.

2549
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:28,340
And the lawyers from the other side,
I'm like,

2550
01:27:28,341 --> 01:27:29,450
well you can't do,
there's no harm,

2551
01:27:29,451 --> 01:27:30,350
no foul stuff.

2552
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:31,910
I'm like,
what are you talking about?

2553
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:32,893
You know,
no one got,

2554
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,790
everybody's doing great.
But he's like,

2555
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:35,511
well I think,
you know,

2556
01:27:35,511 --> 01:27:37,220
you could've done something different or
something like that.

2557
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:38,031
And He,
like,

2558
01:27:38,031 --> 01:27:40,250
if you look at a malpractice case,
the first thing you have to do is prove

2559
01:27:40,251 --> 01:27:41,084
harm,
right?

2560
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,710
If no one gets hurt,
there's nothing there.

2561
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:44,330
And it's not that anyone,
no one got hurt,

2562
01:27:44,331 --> 01:27:47,270
no one did.
But it's just like so the,

2563
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:49,040
so the guy at the end of it goes through
and he says,

2564
01:27:49,041 --> 01:27:50,420
yeah,
there were a lot of errors,

2565
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:52,160
right?
And they're paying this guy and they

2566
01:27:52,161 --> 01:27:55,910
chick chosen.
But I think you gave patients too much

2567
01:27:55,911 --> 01:27:58,310
choice in their care,
which is,

2568
01:27:58,311 --> 01:27:59,810
I'm like,
what are you talking about?

2569
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:01,303
You know,
so if I,

2570
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:05,120
if the criticism was that was,
that's all they had pieces now he said

2571
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:09,890
it was really bad air and they said you
gave patients too much choice and you

2572
01:28:09,891 --> 01:28:11,600
didn't document stuff as well as you
should have.

2573
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,620
Right.
And I still think that they should have

2574
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:14,454
just,
just manage it.

2575
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,820
So this is,
this is the decision to make based on

2576
01:28:16,821 --> 01:28:18,890
that.
And I will guarantee if anybody who was

2577
01:28:18,891 --> 01:28:22,070
on that committee that knew me cause
people knew me on the committee knew I

2578
01:28:22,071 --> 01:28:23,690
was a good guy,
they never had problems with me.

2579
01:28:23,691 --> 01:28:25,700
So that's why they were shocked when
this came out.

2580
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:28,880
But if they knew that information,
I'm 100% convinced that would be a

2581
01:28:28,881 --> 01:28:30,080
difference.
So what does it stand?

2582
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:33,560
So then you know,
I get done with that and then the state

2583
01:28:33,561 --> 01:28:34,960
gets involved because the state has to
respond.

2584
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:39,530
Any complaints the state state gets this
complaint stayed in New Mexico and it's

2585
01:28:39,531 --> 01:28:41,840
kind of weird because my next door
neighbors on the state board and I'm

2586
01:28:41,841 --> 01:28:44,210
just like totally avoiding the guy cause
I don't want to influence anything.

2587
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,980
Right.
I'd be giving them flowers.

2588
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,300
No,
but I just didn't want to do.

2589
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:48,290
And I even told him,
I said,

2590
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:50,210
hey,
my next door neighbor is on your board.

2591
01:28:50,211 --> 01:28:51,350
Right.
So I don't want,

2592
01:28:51,351 --> 01:28:53,180
I want to be totally ethical about this.
This is a story.

2593
01:28:53,181 --> 01:28:53,661
So I,
you know,

2594
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:54,310
they,
they said,

2595
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:55,310
dude,
all my flowers.

2596
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:57,370
Yeah.
Well maybe we can maybe give him an elk

2597
01:28:57,380 --> 01:29:01,010
stack or something like that.
So then the board gets us and they say,

2598
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:01,650
man,
this is,

2599
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:01,980
this is a

2600
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,410
bad recommendation and we're going to
give you two options.

2601
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:06,230
You can suspend your license,
you know,

2602
01:29:06,231 --> 01:29:08,730
you can voluntarily suspend your,
each surrender your license,

2603
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:12,150
or you can go to trial.
You know,

2604
01:29:12,151 --> 01:29:14,340
we can do another hearing,
which probably didn't take a year.

2605
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,920
It's going to cost you tons of money,
you know,

2606
01:29:16,921 --> 01:29:18,120
which I don't,
I'm just tired of this.

2607
01:29:18,121 --> 01:29:20,490
I'm tired of lawyers spending all this
money and I'm not,

2608
01:29:20,491 --> 01:29:22,110
I'm still trying to figure out how am I
gonna feed my kids.

2609
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,040
So then,
you know,

2610
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:26,400
the state says,
or what you can do is we'll send you to

2611
01:29:26,401 --> 01:29:28,380
a place and I'll evaluate you
independently.

2612
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,480
And then if everything goes well,
we'll give you a license back.

2613
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,010
So that I said,
okay,

2614
01:29:32,011 --> 01:29:33,150
that's what I'm gonna do.
Cause I'm tired of this.

2615
01:29:33,151 --> 01:29:36,810
I don't want to spend $100,000 and wait
a year when I can go to this place and

2616
01:29:36,811 --> 01:29:39,930
spend $12,000 and get evaluated and go
from there.

2617
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:41,130
So I was,
that's where I was this week.

2618
01:29:41,131 --> 01:29:43,020
In fact,
I was in Denver being with these other

2619
01:29:43,021 --> 01:29:45,030
surgeons and they were just like going
through all this case,

2620
01:29:45,031 --> 01:29:45,421
case,
case.

2621
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:46,171
What would you do?
What would you do?

2622
01:29:46,171 --> 01:29:48,990
What would you do?
And I am clearly,

2623
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:50,640
you know,
even though I haven't done this stuff in

2624
01:29:50,641 --> 01:29:52,590
two years,
I'm clearly convinced that they're going

2625
01:29:52,591 --> 01:29:53,424
to say,
hey man,

2626
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,740
you're fine.
And they're going to say,

2627
01:29:55,741 --> 01:29:57,490
here,
go operate with somebody for taking lots

2628
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,130
of,
look at those cases where you were

2629
01:29:59,131 --> 01:30:00,900
judged upon poorly.
They're not,

2630
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:01,920
they're not.
They're not,

2631
01:30:01,921 --> 01:30:03,720
because they wanted to be totally into
fucking insane.

2632
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:04,960
So,
um,

2633
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:08,790
how do you make a lemon?
Now I'm living off my savings.

2634
01:30:09,090 --> 01:30:10,200
You know,
I saved up some money.

2635
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:12,330
So I lived off that and that's,
that's mostly yet,

2636
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,640
you know,
so I'm just kind of slowly watching my

2637
01:30:14,641 --> 01:30:15,780
savings dwindle down.

2638
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:18,540
Jesus Christ has got to be stressful.
It's kind of stressful.

2639
01:30:18,541 --> 01:30:19,021
I mean,
you know,

2640
01:30:19,021 --> 01:30:21,390
I've got a girlfriend in Mexico living,
but I,

2641
01:30:21,391 --> 01:30:22,141
you know,
I don't want to be,

2642
01:30:22,141 --> 01:30:22,961
you know,
but I've got kids who,

2643
01:30:22,961 --> 01:30:25,230
we've got kids,
I've got a kid with her and I've got

2644
01:30:25,231 --> 01:30:27,090
three kids with my ex wife and they're
all young kids.

2645
01:30:27,091 --> 01:30:28,770
And so I'm back.
And so I said I'm traveling back and

2646
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:29,550
forth,
man,

2647
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:30,450
back and forth,
you know,

2648
01:30:30,451 --> 01:30:31,560
trying to support these kids.
You know,

2649
01:30:31,561 --> 01:30:34,140
I had to pull my kids out of school,
I had to put them in a different school

2650
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:36,870
because the income wasn't there anymore.
And you know,

2651
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:38,160
it's so it's,
it's kind of a pain.

2652
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:40,980
It's Kinda kinda sucks.
So where's the Stan as far as like

2653
01:30:40,981 --> 01:30:42,600
getting your license reinstated?
Yeah,

2654
01:30:42,601 --> 01:30:46,190
so probably,
so I was just in Denver,

2655
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,460
they said it'll take about eight weeks.

2656
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:48,930
So they'll give me a,
they'll give me a plan,

2657
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:49,501
they'll say,
okay,

2658
01:30:49,501 --> 01:30:50,520
we think that,
you know,

2659
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:53,310
I am almost a hundred percent convinced
they're going to say,

2660
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,640
you know,
we need you to go work with some dude

2661
01:30:56,641 --> 01:30:58,080
for a couple months cause you're out of
practice.

2662
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,760
And I think I'll probably end up doing
that.

2663
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:02,310
Then the board,
the State Board will review what they

2664
01:31:02,311 --> 01:31:03,360
say.
And in longer they say,

2665
01:31:03,361 --> 01:31:04,194
hey man,
you're,

2666
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,450
you know what you're doing,
they'll give it back to me.

2667
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:08,070
So insane.
Yeah.

2668
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:08,911
So anyway,
it's,

2669
01:31:08,911 --> 01:31:09,660
it's,
you know,

2670
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:11,010
again,
I don't blame the state board.

2671
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:13,080
I don't believe the people who are on
the committee because they were

2672
01:31:13,081 --> 01:31:14,160
clueless.
I didn't know what I,

2673
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:16,350
I blame someone competence by the
administrators,

2674
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:17,611
you know,
and,

2675
01:31:17,611 --> 01:31:19,560
and just whoever reviewed me,
you know,

2676
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:24,060
if it were a caveman times Joe,
I go with a big club and like what the

2677
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:25,051
F,
you know,

2678
01:31:25,051 --> 01:31:26,070
I understand,
man,

2679
01:31:26,071 --> 01:31:27,510
that's a,
that's very disheartening.

2680
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:28,530
But it's,
I've,

2681
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,370
I have a friend who's going through a
very similar type situation,

2682
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:35,010
uh,
who was also a surgeon.

2683
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:36,690
There's a,
yeah,

2684
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:39,330
it's theirs.
I think people need to understand that

2685
01:31:39,331 --> 01:31:41,880
the medical business is in fact a
business now.

2686
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:44,580
And we think of hospitals as being these
completely,

2687
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:48,420
you know,
a egalitarian places that just,

2688
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:51,270
they,
they exist to heal people and to do the

2689
01:31:51,271 --> 01:31:53,070
best job.
They sort of do,

2690
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,500
but they also,
they need to make a lot of money.

2691
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:56,820
Well,
they got to pay the light bills.

2692
01:31:56,821 --> 01:31:57,410
I mean,
I understand,

2693
01:31:57,410 --> 01:31:59,100
I understand that.
But then there's a point,

2694
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:01,630
you know,
it gets kind of like you've got to make

2695
01:32:01,631 --> 01:32:04,930
a decision between patient care and,
you know.

2696
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,490
Yeah.
And the CEO making,

2697
01:32:06,491 --> 01:32:08,680
making a little extra now they do that
with animals too.

2698
01:32:08,681 --> 01:32:09,790
I mean,
you gotta be really careful.

2699
01:32:09,791 --> 01:32:13,300
I had a friend who had a recent
situation happened with his dog where,

2700
01:32:13,301 --> 01:32:14,820
uh,
they were telling his dog him,

2701
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:18,820
his dog needed to get some crazy surgery
and he didn't have the money for it.

2702
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:20,260
And he's like,
are you sure?

2703
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,610
You sure they need to end?
He said,

2704
01:32:21,611 --> 01:32:23,650
I had to ask them over and over and over
again.

2705
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:25,480
And he said,
in filing the veterinarian said,

2706
01:32:25,481 --> 01:32:28,420
well,
we could try a steroid,

2707
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:30,940
uh,
on the dog and see if that works.

2708
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,900
Fucking fixed it 100%.
Yeah.

2709
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:37,510
And the steroid costs like 150 bucks
versus some $30,000 surgery.

2710
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:41,200
But they kept pushing this surgery,
which would have fused that dog's discs.

2711
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:43,130
They were like,
this needs to happen,

2712
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:44,140
need to do this.
And he's like,

2713
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:46,960
well,
there's no other options and we've

2714
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:51,640
exhausted all possible options.
And then finally after asking over and

2715
01:32:51,641 --> 01:32:54,490
over and over again,
she suggested meekly this,

2716
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:56,680
which instantly fixed it.
Yeah.

2717
01:32:56,681 --> 01:33:00,050
It's Kinda like two months.
The dog was 100% you know it's got,

2718
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:00,281
no,
no,

2719
01:33:00,281 --> 01:33:01,210
no.
Cause I know he hit Chris,

2720
01:33:01,211 --> 01:33:03,160
Chris around here a while.
I'm going to listen to a little bit of

2721
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:03,430
stuff.

2722
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:04,780
And then in his premise at the
beginning,

2723
01:33:04,781 --> 01:33:06,550
which I haven't read his book yet,
but I think it's great.

2724
01:33:06,551 --> 01:33:08,320
I mean,
here's the problem with Western

2725
01:33:08,321 --> 01:33:09,154
medicine.
You know,

2726
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:13,750
we're facing this,
I mean it's like a war against chronic

2727
01:33:13,751 --> 01:33:15,610
disease.
It's like we're being invaded by,

2728
01:33:15,870 --> 01:33:17,560
you know,
remember Independence Day where that all

2729
01:33:17,561 --> 01:33:20,770
of this in doctors,
we got bb guns.

2730
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:24,010
I mean the stuff we are shooting at them
doesn't work for chronic disease.

2731
01:33:24,011 --> 01:33:24,641
Now.
Acute stuff,

2732
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:25,361
it's different.
You know,

2733
01:33:25,361 --> 01:33:27,670
there's some stuff that we have this
wonderful technology,

2734
01:33:27,671 --> 01:33:31,480
but the run of the mill diabetes and
obesity doctors are great for fixing

2735
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:34,570
broken jump joy.
There's no doubt about that.

2736
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,550
Even even like arthritis and I sell
every day,

2737
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:40,240
you know,
if we were trained properly in nutrition

2738
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:41,500
and exercise,
you know,

2739
01:33:41,501 --> 01:33:42,670
that's what I've known my whole life,
you know,

2740
01:33:42,671 --> 01:33:44,230
and I know what I'm doing exercise wise.

2741
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:47,860
But you know,
if we were allowed to do that and

2742
01:33:47,861 --> 01:33:49,900
instead of training all these,
you know,

2743
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:54,850
radiology technicians and blood draw
technicians and nursing assistants,

2744
01:33:54,851 --> 01:33:57,250
if you had an army of preventative
people,

2745
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:59,230
bit of medicine people,
you know,

2746
01:33:59,231 --> 01:34:01,690
and then we train all these people to go
into people's homes.

2747
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:04,480
You know,
I think Chris was talking about that and

2748
01:34:04,481 --> 01:34:08,140
just get the crap out of their diet and
show them how to be healthier,

2749
01:34:08,141 --> 01:34:09,010
you know?
I mean you would,

2750
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:10,600
you would save,
you know,

2751
01:34:10,601 --> 01:34:13,140
it's funny watching the politicians
debate about healthcare,

2752
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:14,080
how to fund it.
You know,

2753
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:17,950
it's like you guys are arguing about the
tie can't tannic as it's coming up in

2754
01:34:17,951 --> 01:34:20,560
the iceberg and you're not,
you're arguing about the color of the

2755
01:34:20,561 --> 01:34:21,790
deck chairs.
I mean,

2756
01:34:21,791 --> 01:34:24,760
we're going over a cliff and we're not
fixing it.

2757
01:34:24,761 --> 01:34:27,970
By keeping putting bandaids,
you're not going to write it.

2758
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:31,000
The technology's not going to fix
diabetes.

2759
01:34:31,001 --> 01:34:32,980
Nutritionist,
you know that this is a year of

2760
01:34:32,981 --> 01:34:35,620
essentially dealing with the problem and
it's already gotten to a point where

2761
01:34:35,621 --> 01:34:36,630
you're in the hospital.
Yeah.

2762
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,680
I mean there's,
you know,

2763
01:34:37,690 --> 01:34:38,590
like I said,
there's a guy,

2764
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:40,210
Peter Attia,
I don't know if you know who he is,

2765
01:34:40,211 --> 01:34:43,030
but he talks about when he was a
surgeon,

2766
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:46,300
he felt like he was at the bottom of a
building and somebody is throwing eggs

2767
01:34:46,301 --> 01:34:49,120
off and his job is to catch the eggs.
Right?

2768
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:49,751
And he's like,
well,

2769
01:34:49,751 --> 01:34:51,520
why would just have the guy stop fucking
thrown out?

2770
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:54,550
But that's what medicine is.
You're just catching me eggs.

2771
01:34:54,551 --> 01:34:57,010
And so instead of it,
we should be investing,

2772
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:57,411
you know,
all,

2773
01:34:57,411 --> 01:34:58,340
we talk about prevention,

2774
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:00,350
but it's bullshit.
We don't do anything for prevention.

2775
01:35:00,351 --> 01:35:02,180
It's so little.
And then the problem,

2776
01:35:02,181 --> 01:35:03,290
the problem is,
a lot of it is,

2777
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:06,080
it doesn't work the way we've designed,
you know.

2778
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:07,670
Yeah.
There's a,

2779
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:11,360
there's a lot of money in fixing you and
there's not a whole lot of money in

2780
01:35:11,361 --> 01:35:12,380
telling you to eat.
Well,

2781
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:13,070
no,
there's not.

2782
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:16,850
There's not a lot.
But it is a changing climate though

2783
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:17,870
with,
because of,

2784
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:20,900
uh,
people at Chris Kresser and Robb Wolf

2785
01:35:20,901 --> 01:35:23,600
and doctor Rhonda Patrick and a lot of
others,

2786
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:27,440
they're giving out really good nutrition
advice and people changing the way they

2787
01:35:27,441 --> 01:35:31,490
eat and think about food and it's having
a massive effect on the inflammation

2788
01:35:31,491 --> 01:35:34,010
that they carry in their body.
I know so many people that used to have

2789
01:35:34,011 --> 01:35:35,520
joint pain.
Um,

2790
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:37,430
uh,
a great example is,

2791
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:39,440
um,
uh,

2792
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:43,370
the primal kitchen assistant mark
Sisson's book,

2793
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:45,050
which is fantastic.

2794
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:48,170
And His story mark story about having
his own,

2795
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:50,090
um,
inflammatory issues with his hands.

2796
01:35:50,091 --> 01:35:52,820
He had some pretty severe arthritis and
he thought it was just going to be with

2797
01:35:52,821 --> 01:35:54,740
him forever.
He changed his diet,

2798
01:35:54,741 --> 01:35:59,741
reduces all the refined carbohydrates.
It goes on this protein,

2799
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:02,180
high fat diet,
and it all goes away.

2800
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:05,180
I mean,
there's so many examples of that.

2801
01:36:05,181 --> 01:36:09,080
And I just watched this documentary
called what's with wheat and it's all

2802
01:36:09,081 --> 01:36:09,930
about,
uh,

2803
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:11,900
glyphosate in the wheat,
uh,

2804
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:15,440
roundup.
And how when they say it's safe for

2805
01:36:15,441 --> 01:36:16,760
people to consume,
they say,

2806
01:36:16,761 --> 01:36:19,070
well,
it only affects plants and bacteria.

2807
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,050
They'd be like,
well what about your microbiome?

2808
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:24,860
Your microbiome is filled with bacteria
and you're killing that stuff.

2809
01:36:24,861 --> 01:36:28,580
Like we don't think of that as being an
issue.

2810
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:32,900
You know,
we don't think of sedentary lifestyle as

2811
01:36:32,901 --> 01:36:34,580
being an issue when it comes to the,
the,

2812
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:38,420
the ultimate cause for you to wind up in
the hospital needing surgery.

2813
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,750
But it absolutely is.
No,

2814
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:41,420
it is.
I can tell you one of the things I used

2815
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:41,961
to see,
cause you know,

2816
01:36:41,961 --> 01:36:43,850
when you're,
when you're a surgeon you like somebody

2817
01:36:43,851 --> 01:36:46,460
comes in with bad arthritis and you
placed her knee and they feel better for

2818
01:36:46,461 --> 01:36:47,960
a while and you're like,
oh,

2819
01:36:47,961 --> 01:36:49,460
that's great man,
I really helped this person.

2820
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:52,310
Then they come in next year and there
are other needs all jacked up.

2821
01:36:52,311 --> 01:36:55,340
And then you a that,
well you should have just done

2822
01:36:55,341 --> 01:36:56,750
something.
So they didn't need our threat.

2823
01:36:56,751 --> 01:36:57,800
It didn't get,
you know,

2824
01:36:57,890 --> 01:37:00,110
didn't need surgery.
On the other time that I've had

2825
01:37:00,111 --> 01:37:02,780
conversations with people that their dad
that needs a,

2826
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:05,300
an artificial knee and I'm like,
are you sure?

2827
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:06,920
Are you sure?
Like,

2828
01:37:06,921 --> 01:37:08,030
yeah,
he's limping bad.

2829
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:09,400
I mean,
he really can't take it anymore.

2830
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:11,900
Like,
have you exhausted all possible options?

2831
01:37:11,901 --> 01:37:12,970
Like what have you done about the Diet?

2832
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:13,833
No,
he won't.

2833
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:15,080
He's not into that.
He's,

2834
01:37:15,081 --> 01:37:15,950
oh,
he's not into that.

2835
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:17,920
Okay,
well here's a problem because no one's

2836
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:20,320
demonstrated the Diet works.
But I will tell you this is,

2837
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,620
this is,
and you know,

2838
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,540
well,
no one's demonstrated it in terms of

2839
01:37:23,541 --> 01:37:24,760
like scientific,
right?

2840
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:26,320
But I will tell you that,
you know,

2841
01:37:26,321 --> 01:37:26,900
just,
you know,

2842
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:29,740
cause I told you because I'm a freak
because I,

2843
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:32,360
I'm just eating meat and I'm doing this
athletic stuff and nobody says you're an

2844
01:37:32,361 --> 01:37:35,180
l or your genetic freak or whatever.
You're an n equals one.

2845
01:37:35,181 --> 01:37:37,520
So we made this website called n equals
many meters,

2846
01:37:37,521 --> 01:37:39,860
other air force guy that he's also a
corner bar.

2847
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:40,730
We got this thing,
we said,

2848
01:37:40,731 --> 01:37:44,600
well what if people started gathering
this information together and we could

2849
01:37:44,601 --> 01:37:46,220
start documenting that.
And that's what we did.

2850
01:37:46,221 --> 01:37:48,380
So we put out a survey on twitter.
I said,

2851
01:37:48,381 --> 01:37:50,150
hey,
how many of you guys would be willing to

2852
01:37:50,151 --> 01:37:52,280
go 90 days and just eat,
eat a bunch of steaks?

2853
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:55,170
And I had like 400 I didn't have that
many followers by like 400 people.

2854
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:56,063
Yeah,
we'll do it.

2855
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:58,200
That's amazing.
So we put the,

2856
01:37:58,201 --> 01:37:58,561
we,
you know,

2857
01:37:58,561 --> 01:38:02,120
we developed this website and it's
called n equals many Dotcom for people

2858
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:04,380
want to see.
So we developed this website and then we

2859
01:38:04,381 --> 01:38:07,900
start getting these first equal sign or
eat q eqs spell.

2860
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,710
I don't think I put an equals on a,
on a website now.

2861
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:14,040
And he and e q u a l many doctors,
right?

2862
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:18,780
So we do this and we get all these
people that sign up and we ended up

2863
01:38:18,781 --> 01:38:21,780
having about close to a hundred people
just do 90 days.

2864
01:38:21,781 --> 01:38:23,100
It just any meat.
And then we,

2865
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:24,300
and it's,
and again,

2866
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:27,690
there's a lot of scientific route things
you can criticize about this.

2867
01:38:27,691 --> 01:38:30,720
You know,
it's just guys ate meat and egg though

2868
01:38:30,721 --> 01:38:32,640
still.
But you know,

2869
01:38:32,641 --> 01:38:35,400
when we got done and I've got the
results that we just,

2870
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:36,900
you know,
we're still analyzing the data because

2871
01:38:36,901 --> 01:38:38,480
we're all doing this for free and we're
going to weren't,

2872
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:39,810
you know,
we're trying to get people to help us

2873
01:38:39,811 --> 01:38:43,620
analyze the data and you know,
but of these hundred people,

2874
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:46,950
you know,
there's about 85 action of these people.

2875
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:49,050
We ask them what happened to your
general health?

2876
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:51,690
What happened to your sexual health?
What happened to your exercise capacity?

2877
01:38:51,691 --> 01:38:53,460
What happens to your gi health,
your skin,

2878
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:57,030
every,
we asked all these questions and there

2879
01:38:57,031 --> 01:38:59,580
was maybe one,
1% where they said it got worse.

2880
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:02,490
99% got better,
much better.

2881
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:03,820
Or say to say,
you know,

2882
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:05,910
it was just like unanimously everybody
got,

2883
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,340
you know,
pretty much either the same or is it

2884
01:39:08,341 --> 01:39:11,460
possible that there's some bias in that
group because they're following you?

2885
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:12,240
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2886
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,690
I mean I'm well aware of that,
you know,

2887
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:14,613
and that's,
that's,

2888
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:15,091
you know,
that's,

2889
01:39:15,091 --> 01:39:17,000
but it's interesting but then we're
getting some old lab data.

2890
01:39:17,030 --> 01:39:20,400
Cause I know you like about lab data.
So I get people and I don't have access

2891
01:39:20,401 --> 01:39:22,640
to all the data and I didn't want it.
I didn't want to have access to the

2892
01:39:22,641 --> 01:39:22,750
date.

2893
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:26,010
I don't want to bias myself against it.
So I'm getting fed the data and I'm

2894
01:39:26,011 --> 01:39:30,210
seeing that people's blood pressure is
normalizing people's hemoglobin.

2895
01:39:30,211 --> 01:39:32,430
A one C,
which has never had measure glucose is

2896
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:36,900
normalizing people's inflammation.
Markers are normalizing,

2897
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:39,990
you know,
all these markers of disease are going

2898
01:39:39,991 --> 01:39:41,440
in the right direction.
You know,

2899
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:42,960
we're just seeing good stuff,
you know,

2900
01:39:42,961 --> 01:39:45,960
because in a lot of the people will say
meat causes diabetes.

2901
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,460
Me Causes Hypertension.
He had,

2902
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:49,890
the only time I've ever seen me causes
diabetes.

2903
01:39:49,891 --> 01:39:51,060
Isn't that wacky?
What?

2904
01:39:51,061 --> 01:39:54,210
The health documentary,
which has been widely disproven and we

2905
01:39:54,211 --> 01:39:55,950
had on it,
rewrote a whole piece about that,

2906
01:39:55,951 --> 01:39:59,520
debunking that and like how much stuff
and that it's like fake science.

2907
01:39:59,521 --> 01:40:02,340
Like what they're saying about meat
causing diabetes.

2908
01:40:02,341 --> 01:40:03,650
There's no evidence of that.
Yeah.

2909
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:04,301
I mean they,
they,

2910
01:40:04,301 --> 01:40:06,510
they look some,
they use them associational stuff and

2911
01:40:06,511 --> 01:40:07,410
that's all they ever do.

2912
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:10,170
I mean it's like some associations,
but they're putting it out as if it's

2913
01:40:10,171 --> 01:40:13,410
100% factual.
And like the sounding the alarms,

2914
01:40:13,411 --> 01:40:16,620
like this is what's causing diabetes.
It's meet me while they're completely

2915
01:40:16,621 --> 01:40:19,710
ignoring the consumption of all these
refined carbohydrates,

2916
01:40:19,711 --> 01:40:21,720
these people are eating with the meat.
Yeah,

2917
01:40:21,721 --> 01:40:23,220
I mean 100%.
I mean that's totally true.

2918
01:40:23,670 --> 01:40:25,440
I mean the uh,
you know,

2919
01:40:25,441 --> 01:40:27,840
and so one of the thing is so nice about
studying these people,

2920
01:40:27,841 --> 01:40:29,100
they're just eating meat.
I mean,

2921
01:40:29,101 --> 01:40:33,060
you isolate a variable you to isolate.
So we know what happens when you just

2922
01:40:33,061 --> 01:40:33,391
eat.
No.

2923
01:40:33,391 --> 01:40:36,460
Are they allowed to take supplements
during the time we had so many?

2924
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:39,180
We the what we said we document it.
Yeah.

2925
01:40:39,181 --> 01:40:41,250
We had them document stuff and some of
them do some,

2926
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,750
you know,
it was Kinda like one of those things

2927
01:40:42,751 --> 01:40:44,050
where we,
cause we,

2928
01:40:44,051 --> 01:40:45,320
we'd never done this before and like
we're,

2929
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:47,490
and we made them document all kinds of
stuff and a lot of people,

2930
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:49,860
some of the people initially dropped out
can we made them document too much

2931
01:40:49,861 --> 01:40:51,250
stuff.
Like it's too much of a hassle looking

2932
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:53,980
at Portland stuff.
So we had percentage dropped

2933
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,750
out because he just didn't want
documents stuff.

2934
01:40:55,751 --> 01:40:58,600
We had a certain percentage of dropped
out because they didn't feel,

2935
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:00,190
they felt like they had the low energy.
Right.

2936
01:41:00,191 --> 01:41:01,720
And so a lot of people when they do
this,

2937
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:03,410
they just can't eat very much.
I mean,

2938
01:41:03,411 --> 01:41:05,590
they get full and they're not eating
enough.

2939
01:41:05,591 --> 01:41:08,500
And so that's one of the biggest things
I tell people when they switch over this

2940
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:10,150
eat meat.
Like it's your job.

2941
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:13,040
That's what I tell them.
You got to eat edd initially.

2942
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:14,920
Didn't they just eat until they're not
hungry anymore?

2943
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:18,220
Well the problem is you,
the problem is a lot of people lose

2944
01:41:18,221 --> 01:41:19,090
weight on this.
You know,

2945
01:41:19,091 --> 01:41:21,550
a lot of people get lean on this stuff
is that,

2946
01:41:21,610 --> 01:41:23,500
you know,
your hunger goes down pretty low because

2947
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:23,831
you're,
you know,

2948
01:41:23,831 --> 01:41:25,480
you're eating a lot of fat and eating a
lot of protein.

2949
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,440
You know,
especially if you're eating,

2950
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:28,030
if you're eating Ribeye steaks,
you know,

2951
01:41:28,031 --> 01:41:30,850
that's probably about 70% fat,
30% protein,

2952
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:32,800
something like that.
So I mean it's,

2953
01:41:32,801 --> 01:41:34,480
it's really,
really satisfying.

2954
01:41:34,481 --> 01:41:36,220
And so,
you know,

2955
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:36,970
they,
they,

2956
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:38,080
they tend to,
they tend to under,

2957
01:41:38,081 --> 01:41:40,730
cause no one's used to like if I sold
you joe go eat four pounds of meat a

2958
01:41:40,731 --> 01:41:41,800
day,
they're going to be like,

2959
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:42,521
well,
I mean,

2960
01:41:42,521 --> 01:41:44,650
I know you like eating meat,
but I mean even that's probably a big

2961
01:41:44,651 --> 01:41:45,820
town a lot.
It's a lot,

2962
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:47,740
you know,
and so to get used to that,

2963
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:49,120
it takes awhile.
You don't,

2964
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:51,940
it depends on your activity level.
Cause I work out pretty damn hard and I

2965
01:41:51,941 --> 01:41:54,040
do it pretty often.
Um,

2966
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:56,530
so I mean,
they do some crazy shit man.

2967
01:41:56,531 --> 01:41:58,230
I saw you box jumps.
Yeah.

2968
01:41:58,231 --> 01:41:58,691
Yeah.
I mean,

2969
01:41:58,691 --> 01:41:59,291
I,
you know,

2970
01:41:59,291 --> 01:42:00,780
this is like I said,
this is uh,

2971
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:01,841
uh,
you know,

2972
01:42:01,841 --> 01:42:03,700
back to that glycolytic stuff.
I do.

2973
01:42:03,701 --> 01:42:04,481
I mean I'm,
I'm,

2974
01:42:04,481 --> 01:42:06,040
you know,
I'm Mike,

2975
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:08,210
Capacity to extend is great.
And one of the things is because I,

2976
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:10,080
you felt no difference.
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

2977
01:42:10,081 --> 01:42:12,050
but you felt no difference between,
um,

2978
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:17,370
going from the ketogenic diet to eating
meat or did it feel like you had more

2979
01:42:17,371 --> 01:42:17,930
energy?

2980
01:42:17,930 --> 01:42:20,180
I had more energy,
I had better libido.

2981
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:21,620
You know,
you wake up every day,

2982
01:42:21,621 --> 01:42:22,970
you know you're ready to go.
You know,

2983
01:42:22,971 --> 01:42:23,804
it's like,
uh,

2984
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,030
you know,
I've had a couple people that,

2985
01:42:26,031 --> 01:42:27,650
and I haven't tested it,
but I have a couple of people who have

2986
01:42:27,651 --> 01:42:29,510
done this and again,
we need to get more data.

2987
01:42:29,511 --> 01:42:31,370
I've had a couple people have done it.
It said their testosterone level went

2988
01:42:31,371 --> 01:42:31,800
up,
you know,

2989
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:35,730
like they went on to all meet their
testosterone went up about 20% and so I

2990
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:36,231
don't,
I was like,

2991
01:42:36,231 --> 01:42:37,250
well that's interesting.
You know,

2992
01:42:37,251 --> 01:42:40,010
I don't put a lot of faith and just a
couple of anecdotes.

2993
01:42:40,011 --> 01:42:41,450
So that happened.
So a lot of people that go on the

2994
01:42:41,451 --> 01:42:44,510
ketogenic diet because the cholesterol
is actually the precursor to

2995
01:42:44,511 --> 01:42:45,990
testosterone.
Absolutely.

2996
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:47,840
Yeah.
It's kind of interesting if you look at,

2997
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:49,940
you know,
red meat consumption in the U S and in

2998
01:42:49,941 --> 01:42:54,941
1977 so red meat has gone down about 30
to 40% really?

2999
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:59,930
We used to be way more in the 70s we ate
about 30 40% more red meat than we do

3000
01:42:59,931 --> 01:43:01,010
now.
No kidding.

3001
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:03,230
Yep.
And also our testosterone levels have

3002
01:43:03,231 --> 01:43:07,670
dropped significantly and population
testosterone levels have dropped about

3003
01:43:07,671 --> 01:43:08,504
that same amount.

3004
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:11,350
Bullied a lot of red mean I would've
never imagined me

3005
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:13,000
the last.
Now we listened.

3006
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:13,990
We used to.
Wow.

3007
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:15,820
Yeah.
So here's another interesting fact.

3008
01:43:16,510 --> 01:43:18,550
Hong Kong,
Hong Kong,

3009
01:43:18,551 --> 01:43:21,820
right now if you look up,
if you google Hong Kong life expectancy,

3010
01:43:21,821 --> 01:43:24,100
they live the longest out of anybody on
the world.

3011
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:28,060
Right.
They eat about 40% more red meat than we

3012
01:43:28,061 --> 01:43:31,510
do in the US and them.
And they have the longest lived people

3013
01:43:31,511 --> 01:43:33,070
in the world,
which is interesting.

3014
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:36,350
Yeah.
I'd read something that said that 100%

3015
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:40,130
of all people that live over a hundred
no,

3016
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:44,630
it was some high number of all people
that live over a hundred consume red

3017
01:43:44,631 --> 01:43:45,070
meat.

3018
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:45,791
Yeah.
I don't doubt it.

3019
01:43:45,791 --> 01:43:46,850
You know,
it's interesting cause you know the,

3020
01:43:46,851 --> 01:43:48,330
the other vegans really liked to point
out,

3021
01:43:48,370 --> 01:43:51,860
okay now it's a blue zone and edelman
and I suppose they looked at the people

3022
01:43:51,861 --> 01:43:51,980
that

3023
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,140
lived over a hundred in,
in Okinawa.

3024
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:56,780
None of them were vegetarians.
All of them ate meat.

3025
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:59,500
Yeah.
There's not a lot.

3026
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:04,190
Not a lot of good solid evidence that
being a Vegan is a solution to a long

3027
01:44:04,191 --> 01:44:04,940
life.
Well,

3028
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:05,511
I mean,
you know that,

3029
01:44:05,511 --> 01:44:07,280
you know,
obviously there's different propaganda

3030
01:44:07,281 --> 01:44:08,270
out there and I think,
you know,

3031
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:09,310
here's what I would say.
You know,

3032
01:44:09,310 --> 01:44:11,240
if you want to do veganism and it makes
you healthy,

3033
01:44:11,241 --> 01:44:12,980
fun,
most people can't do it.

3034
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,660
I mean,
we know that about right,

3035
01:44:14,950 --> 01:44:17,720
but the thing is,
we're not just talking about if you want

3036
01:44:17,721 --> 01:44:19,430
to do it,
we're talking about people that are

3037
01:44:19,431 --> 01:44:22,460
proselytizing,
like they have this idea and they push

3038
01:44:22,461 --> 01:44:25,010
this idea down everybody's throats.
But if we're just looking at the actual

3039
01:44:25,011 --> 01:44:26,810
data,
the health data,

3040
01:44:27,110 --> 01:44:29,000
like what's good for you,
what's bad for you?

3041
01:44:29,390 --> 01:44:32,510
It's it.
There's no like overwhelming evidence

3042
01:44:32,511 --> 01:44:34,280
that the Vegan ways,
the way to go,

3043
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:34,940
no,
there's not.

3044
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:35,470
I mean,
they're there,

3045
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:36,620
their studies,
they like to push,

3046
01:44:36,621 --> 01:44:38,390
but there's also studies that show that,
you know,

3047
01:44:38,391 --> 01:44:39,260
the opposite effect.
You know,

3048
01:44:39,261 --> 01:44:43,130
if you look at the epic Oxford study,
which had about 60,000 people in it,

3049
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:44,900
you know,
they showed that vegetarians,

3050
01:44:44,901 --> 01:44:47,360
vegans live no longer than meat eaters.
There's no difference.

3051
01:44:47,361 --> 01:44:49,160
Right?
Even though the mediators are probably

3052
01:44:49,161 --> 01:44:50,840
the guys that don't care about their
health.

3053
01:44:50,841 --> 01:44:51,770
True.
So it made,

3054
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:54,530
not only is it not protective,
but it may be a negative.

3055
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:56,450
You can look at it and study out of
Australia,

3056
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:59,630
it looked at 240,000 people called the
45 and up study.

3057
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:01,250
Same thing,
vegans,

3058
01:45:01,251 --> 01:45:02,410
vegetarians,
no loan,

3059
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:03,920
no lever,
no longer life,

3060
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:05,810
no better health.
And so it's Kinda like,

3061
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:07,250
you know,
who do you believe in?

3062
01:45:07,251 --> 01:45:09,200
These guys have their studies that
they're going to quote and you can share

3063
01:45:09,201 --> 01:45:11,150
it.
And I can cherry pick all day and other

3064
01:45:11,151 --> 01:45:12,320
people can cherry pick all day.

3065
01:45:12,710 --> 01:45:15,180
It's just bs.
So my best advantage,

3066
01:45:15,181 --> 01:45:17,540
advices,
and this is I think the best advice you

3067
01:45:17,541 --> 01:45:18,860
can give anybody.
You know,

3068
01:45:18,861 --> 01:45:22,010
until we start seeing dudes walking
around that are in shape.

3069
01:45:22,011 --> 01:45:25,430
And Jack did 120 years old,
you're not going to know what the right

3070
01:45:25,431 --> 01:45:28,520
thing to do is.
And so the best advice you can have is

3071
01:45:28,521 --> 01:45:31,100
to get strong,
get healthy,

3072
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:32,540
you know,
move well,

3073
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:34,130
do everything you can to make your
health good.

3074
01:45:34,131 --> 01:45:36,410
And that's the best you can do because
if you're healthy today,

3075
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,090
odds are you're going to be healthier
tomorrow.

3076
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:39,920
So you know the fact that you know,
Joe,

3077
01:45:39,921 --> 01:45:43,640
you're still got a lot of muscle on you
at 50 means you're more likely to have

3078
01:45:43,641 --> 01:45:45,400
someone you're 60 I mean there's just no
dot.

3079
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:50,030
That's the biggest correlated the best.
One of the best predictors of long life

3080
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:51,650
is your exercise capacity.

3081
01:45:51,650 --> 01:45:54,120
And I think we should bring this up
while we're talking about Vegan diets or

3082
01:45:54,121 --> 01:45:57,230
southern darts.
If you have a standard American diet of

3083
01:45:57,231 --> 01:46:00,500
even eating a bunch of shitty food and
fried chicken and bullshit and

3084
01:46:00,501 --> 01:46:03,350
cheeseburgers and sodas and you go
Vegan,

3085
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:05,360
you will be healthier.
Sure.

3086
01:46:05,470 --> 01:46:08,900
Well cause you're going to remove all
that shitty process food out of your

3087
01:46:08,901 --> 01:46:11,390
diet all the night try.
It's all the stuff that's unnecessary.

3088
01:46:11,391 --> 01:46:13,250
All the preservatives.
If you do that,

3089
01:46:13,251 --> 01:46:16,250
you will be healthier.
But it doesn't necessarily mean the

3090
01:46:16,251 --> 01:46:18,530
Vegan diets the way to go.
I mean,

3091
01:46:18,531 --> 01:46:21,230
it just,
it means that the American diet that

3092
01:46:21,231 --> 01:46:26,190
everybody like rightly criticized as is
the wrong way to go vegan diet.

3093
01:46:26,191 --> 01:46:27,920
Certainly better than that.
Yeah,

3094
01:46:27,921 --> 01:46:29,840
I mean you can do bob on any,
it's better than that.

3095
01:46:29,841 --> 01:46:31,820
I mean just like in a lot of things,
you know,

3096
01:46:31,821 --> 01:46:33,380
this is another point I bring on,
you know,

3097
01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:35,840
cause one of the,
one of the differences between what I

3098
01:46:35,841 --> 01:46:37,870
sort of think is healthy and I don't
know,

3099
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,500
I'll come out and say,
I don't know for sure.

3100
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:42,110
I'm still learning this stuff and I'm
willing to investigate it.

3101
01:46:42,111 --> 01:46:44,150
You know,
I'm willing to put my body to test and

3102
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:45,860
have other people,
you know,

3103
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:47,750
give me data.
But what I,

3104
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:49,710
what we want,
there's a big group out there and says

3105
01:46:49,711 --> 01:46:50,030
you shouldn't

3106
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:52,680
eat a lot of protein.
You should really restrict your protein.

3107
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:56,460
There is some data that talks about
something called [inaudible] that you

3108
01:46:56,461 --> 01:46:57,810
know,
maybe you know,

3109
01:46:57,811 --> 01:47:01,020
it causes cancer,
maybe it inhibits longevity and then

3110
01:47:01,021 --> 01:47:05,920
these lesser animals like mice and a
little tadpoles nematode things and you

3111
01:47:05,930 --> 01:47:06,763
know,
to,

3112
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:10,440
and then there was another group of
scientists out there is getting Stuart

3113
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,420
Phillips out of Canada that's looking at
that.

3114
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:14,400
And it shows that,
you know,

3115
01:47:14,401 --> 01:47:16,410
the more protein you have,
especially when you get older,

3116
01:47:16,490 --> 01:47:18,030
the,
the longer you're going to preserve

3117
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:19,410
muscle,
the better your quality of life isn't

3118
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:20,940
likely longer you're going to live,
you know?

3119
01:47:20,941 --> 01:47:22,770
And so what,
you know,

3120
01:47:22,771 --> 01:47:25,170
what happens if you autopsy and old
person,

3121
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,580
you know,
you get some money and you got an old

3122
01:47:26,581 --> 01:47:28,680
folks home,
their brain has shrunk.

3123
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:30,570
I mean,
their muscles have shrunk and away the

3124
01:47:30,571 --> 01:47:33,870
protein in their bones have shrunk and
away their kidneys have shrunk,

3125
01:47:33,871 --> 01:47:35,790
their hardest shrunk,
their skin has shrunk,

3126
01:47:35,791 --> 01:47:38,060
everything's shrunk because lost all
this protein.

3127
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:40,500
What happens is as you get older and
older,

3128
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:43,110
you lose some of the capacity to digest
meat.

3129
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:46,290
And so what happens is where does your
body get that protein from?

3130
01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:50,460
It just starts taking it from yourself.
You start autocad cannibalizing yourself

3131
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:52,260
to sustain function.
You know,

3132
01:47:52,270 --> 01:47:56,070
it's sustained cellular function.
So if you're not getting that replaced,

3133
01:47:56,250 --> 01:47:59,550
you know,
through diet and meet as outstanding

3134
01:47:59,551 --> 01:48:01,050
source of that,
you know,

3135
01:48:01,051 --> 01:48:02,430
you're going to be frailer and frailer.
You know,

3136
01:48:02,431 --> 01:48:05,790
we have an obesity epidemic,
but we also have a frailty epidemic.

3137
01:48:05,791 --> 01:48:09,150
There's people that are just,
I mean by the time they're 40 I mean

3138
01:48:09,151 --> 01:48:10,410
they may be obese but their weakest

3139
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:11,130
B,
Yeah.

3140
01:48:11,130 --> 01:48:13,460
There's so many people that are just
sedentary lifestyles.

3141
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:15,570
One of the biggest killers of your body
for sure.

3142
01:48:15,571 --> 01:48:16,800
And there's so many people that you look
at it,

3143
01:48:16,801 --> 01:48:18,690
I'm like,
I was talking to a guy the other day and

3144
01:48:18,691 --> 01:48:22,410
it looked like you could just grab his
arm and pull it off his body.

3145
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,380
Like his,
his shoulders were sunk in.

3146
01:48:25,381 --> 01:48:26,950
There was like no muscle tone.
It all.

3147
01:48:26,951 --> 01:48:30,930
And he had no exercise is that there was
none in his life ever.

3148
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:33,870
Like maybe they made them do gym in high
school and that was it.

3149
01:48:33,871 --> 01:48:36,960
And he's just,
he's younger than me and he was falling

3150
01:48:36,961 --> 01:48:38,260
apart.
I can,

3151
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:41,410
you know,
you and I had 50 or like the bar for a

3152
01:48:41,411 --> 01:48:43,460
healthy 50 or normal 50 year old is you
know,

3153
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:46,410
way down low and you know,
we're like total outliers,

3154
01:48:46,411 --> 01:48:48,030
you know this,
the fact that we exercise and have a

3155
01:48:48,031 --> 01:48:50,970
little muscle,
I mean that puts you in the 99% tall

3156
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:53,390
and it's interesting if you just
continue it.

3157
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,480
The thing about it is like I,
if I take a week off man,

3158
01:48:56,510 --> 01:48:58,990
boy do I feel it more at 50 than I did
it third?

3159
01:48:59,030 --> 01:48:59,990
No,
it's crazy.

3160
01:48:59,991 --> 01:49:00,620
Yeah,
that's true.

3161
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:04,070
But I could still get back in shape and
once you get back in shape,

3162
01:49:04,071 --> 01:49:07,580
you just got to keep it going and if you
just keep it going,

3163
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:09,340
it will work for you,
your body.

3164
01:49:09,341 --> 01:49:12,920
It's what we compare.
It's really interesting because what we

3165
01:49:12,921 --> 01:49:16,310
compare in terms of normal body
function,

3166
01:49:16,311 --> 01:49:18,740
like the normal capacity that your body
has,

3167
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:22,790
we're really generally looking at people
that had just the average person.

3168
01:49:22,791 --> 01:49:25,550
Well the average person doesn't really
exercise very hard.

3169
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:28,370
They don't.
So we don't have a lot of data on people

3170
01:49:28,371 --> 01:49:29,600
that are in their fifties it's still
good.

3171
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:31,220
You know what?
I'm not letting this go.

3172
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:32,960
I'm going to keep this fucking body
strong.

3173
01:49:33,110 --> 01:49:35,120
I'm going to make sure I lift heavy
weights.

3174
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:38,570
I'm going to do hard cardio.
I'm going to do sprinting and kickboxing

3175
01:49:38,571 --> 01:49:41,720
and a bunch of shit that requires
explosive energy.

3176
01:49:41,930 --> 01:49:43,400
And uh,
if you do that,

3177
01:49:43,401 --> 01:49:46,130
your body can stay vibrant,
but you have to be diligent.

3178
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:48,400
It's very,
for people to understand this,

3179
01:49:48,401 --> 01:49:51,850
this is not,
if you're just a casual person who just

3180
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:53,110
kind of like half as is,
oh,

3181
01:49:53,111 --> 01:49:55,120
maybe we'll take a spin class.
Good luck,

3182
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:55,790
bitch.
You,

3183
01:49:55,790 --> 01:49:58,330
your body's gonna die.
It's going to rot off and fall apart.

3184
01:49:58,331 --> 01:50:01,060
But if you just decide to be militant
about this,

3185
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:04,150
you can keep a functional body far
longer.

3186
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:08,950
And it's not just about ego,
it's also just about the use of your

3187
01:50:08,951 --> 01:50:11,680
meat vehicle.
Like my body could do a lot of shit that

3188
01:50:11,681 --> 01:50:12,850
most people's bodies can't.

3189
01:50:12,850 --> 01:50:15,340
Like if I want to pick something up,
I don't have to call somebody.

3190
01:50:15,341 --> 01:50:16,750
I just pick it up,
you know?

3191
01:50:16,751 --> 01:50:18,610
And that just that alone,
you know,

3192
01:50:18,611 --> 01:50:20,920
to,
to know that you can carry yourself.

3193
01:50:20,921 --> 01:50:25,330
To know that you can do 50 chin ups to
know that you can move your body around

3194
01:50:25,331 --> 01:50:28,300
in a way that most people find to be
almost impossible.

3195
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,670
It's like,
I want my body to work better.

3196
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:33,190
You know,
it's like having a race car and you can

3197
01:50:33,191 --> 01:50:37,300
choose what horsepower engine it is
based on how much work you put on it.

3198
01:50:37,570 --> 01:50:39,280
I mean,
that's essentially what your body is.

3199
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:41,980
You can choose how much tread you have
in your tires.

3200
01:50:41,981 --> 01:50:44,470
You can choose how good the suspension
is,

3201
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:47,050
how supple it is,
and how well it can maneuver based on

3202
01:50:47,051 --> 01:50:51,940
how much pyogenic exercises you do or
how many different explosive maneuvers,

3203
01:50:51,941 --> 01:50:53,980
you know,
clean and presses and things along those

3204
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:55,540
lines.
You can get that body to work.

3205
01:50:55,541 --> 01:50:56,180
Right?
Yeah.

3206
01:50:56,180 --> 01:50:57,090
I think that,
uh,

3207
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:59,030
you know,
if you look at animals in the wild,

3208
01:50:59,031 --> 01:50:59,640
right?
You know,

3209
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:01,520
if you're looking at a pack of animals
getting hunted,

3210
01:51:01,521 --> 01:51:03,680
which one's going to get killed and
which one are they going to pick out?

3211
01:51:03,681 --> 01:51:04,820
The Flyer,
the frail,

3212
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:06,080
the slow week one.
Right.

3213
01:51:06,081 --> 01:51:08,270
The old one.
So if you're a human and we don't get

3214
01:51:08,271 --> 01:51:10,070
hunted by alliance,
but if you're a human,

3215
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:11,241
if you say,
you know,

3216
01:51:11,241 --> 01:51:13,400
my one was my peak athletic cism,
you know,

3217
01:51:13,401 --> 01:51:17,000
maybe 25 maybe 30 you know,
somewhere in our 33rd 35 somewhere in

3218
01:51:17,001 --> 01:51:17,834
there.
That's like your,

3219
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:19,610
that's your top performance for most
people.

3220
01:51:19,670 --> 01:51:22,670
Yeah.
The closer you can maintain that ability

3221
01:51:22,671 --> 01:51:25,400
as long as you possibly can and do
whatever it takes to get there,

3222
01:51:25,820 --> 01:51:27,440
the farther you are away from death.
I mean,

3223
01:51:27,441 --> 01:51:29,000
that's just,
that's just simple nature.

3224
01:51:29,030 --> 01:51:31,220
You know,
the slow the week they get eaten,

3225
01:51:31,221 --> 01:51:32,360
they die,
they get disease,

3226
01:51:32,361 --> 01:51:33,194
it become disabled.

3227
01:51:33,410 --> 01:51:34,490
I don't want to be,
you know,

3228
01:51:34,491 --> 01:51:36,320
I'm 50 now,
I don't want to be a 60 year old guy

3229
01:51:36,321 --> 01:51:38,000
that's walking around,
limping around,

3230
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:39,400
you know,
needing assistance.

3231
01:51:39,401 --> 01:51:40,280
Somebody that,
you know,

3232
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:42,440
lift my groceries for me and this is
what we have.

3233
01:51:42,441 --> 01:51:43,640
Or even a woman.
I mean,

3234
01:51:43,641 --> 01:51:45,410
women should be out there.
Strength Training,

3235
01:51:45,411 --> 01:51:47,310
getting stronger,
swinging a heavy kettle bells.

3236
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:49,700
[inaudible] that's the other thing that
you brought up explosiveness,

3237
01:51:49,701 --> 01:51:54,080
because I think we're finally starting s
we finally went away from jogging.

3238
01:51:54,110 --> 01:51:54,591
Right?
You know,

3239
01:51:54,591 --> 01:51:57,110
we went from the 1960s to the,
you know,

3240
01:51:57,111 --> 01:51:58,760
early two thousands.
Everybody's jogging.

3241
01:51:58,761 --> 01:52:01,880
That's what you do for health.
Then people started discovering strength

3242
01:52:01,881 --> 01:52:03,440
training.
So now we get people that are in there

3243
01:52:03,441 --> 01:52:06,140
lifting a little bit.
But I think what you also have to do,

3244
01:52:06,141 --> 01:52:06,931
and this is something,
cause I,

3245
01:52:06,931 --> 01:52:08,480
I've got this whole training system
that,

3246
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:09,290
uh,
you know,

3247
01:52:09,290 --> 01:52:12,530
helping people with,
but I think you have to do the explosive

3248
01:52:12,531 --> 01:52:13,100
work too.

3249
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:13,940
So I do,
you know,

3250
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,470
I get in there with medicine balls and I
think a lot of people want to use,

3251
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:19,370
I take medicine balls and I try to break
the fucking things.

3252
01:52:19,371 --> 01:52:21,200
I mean,
I throw him as hard as I can,

3253
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:22,580
you know,
I'm jumping,

3254
01:52:22,581 --> 01:52:24,140
like I said,
I'm jumping with a vest on,

3255
01:52:24,141 --> 01:52:24,621
you know,
this stuff,

3256
01:52:24,621 --> 01:52:26,960
you have to build up two and a half test
to be done in a safe manner.

3257
01:52:27,410 --> 01:52:28,201
You know what?
I'm sprinting,

3258
01:52:28,201 --> 01:52:30,090
I'm on an Airdyne bike.
You have you been on an Airdyne June?

3259
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:31,033
Yeah.
I love those.

3260
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:33,260
Those are the,
I was gonna say you gotta get one for

3261
01:52:33,261 --> 01:52:36,510
here.
Here's all to have you bought new ones.

3262
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:37,611
No,
no.

3263
01:52:37,611 --> 01:52:40,340
Here's what I would tell you to do.
There's a company called octane fitness.

3264
01:52:40,341 --> 01:52:44,010
It makes an Airdyne X.
It's probably better than that aerosault

3265
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:44,960
bike.
Really?

3266
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:45,590
Yeah.

3267
01:52:45,590 --> 01:52:46,510
Pull that up.
I like,

3268
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:48,200
what's it called?
Octane fitness.

3269
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:51,770
Codeine x nine x.
What's better about it?

3270
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:53,390
It's just solid.
I mean,

3271
01:52:53,391 --> 01:52:55,400
it's solid as can be.
I mean it's just,

3272
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:55,970
it's,
it's just,

3273
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:57,200
you can just,
you know,

3274
01:52:57,201 --> 01:52:58,130
in my view,
you know,

3275
01:52:58,140 --> 01:53:00,680
cause I've done everything train,
I mean our broken world records on the

3276
01:53:00,681 --> 01:53:02,570
concept too,
so I know how to do the intense stuff

3277
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,740
that airdyne those type things.
The best thing you could do for the

3278
01:53:05,741 --> 01:53:06,561
short sprints.
I mean,

3279
01:53:06,561 --> 01:53:07,820
they're still out there.
Yeah,

3280
01:53:07,970 --> 01:53:11,150
there's so metabolically demanding.
I mean,

3281
01:53:11,151 --> 01:53:12,140
I don't know if they charged.
I mean,

3282
01:53:12,141 --> 01:53:14,530
I think the only thing that I've always
had reservations about it,

3283
01:53:14,531 --> 01:53:19,430
it's like the sitting down part as far
as what I feel that like you would get

3284
01:53:19,431 --> 01:53:21,560
more exercise if you're supporting your
body weight.

3285
01:53:21,890 --> 01:53:22,341
Well,
I mean,

3286
01:53:22,341 --> 01:53:22,880
you know,
I don't,

3287
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,800
you know,
there's a skier you can do stuff like

3288
01:53:24,801 --> 01:53:25,634
that,
you know,

3289
01:53:25,850 --> 01:53:28,880
but I mean if you,
if you get on that thing and you go as

3290
01:53:28,881 --> 01:53:31,400
hard as you fucking can for 30 seconds
or a minute,

3291
01:53:31,401 --> 01:53:33,680
a minute Seymour's man,
every time I did it for a minute,

3292
01:53:33,681 --> 01:53:35,180
I feel like I'm literally going to
drowned.

3293
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:36,260
I'm going to die.
You know?

3294
01:53:36,261 --> 01:53:37,460
It's just like,
cause I,

3295
01:53:37,461 --> 01:53:38,271
you know,
here's what I do.

3296
01:53:38,271 --> 01:53:40,400
I'd tell I call these things chainsaw
intervals.

3297
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:43,190
So I tell people,
pretend there's some fucking maniac with

3298
01:53:43,191 --> 01:53:46,640
a chainsaw to cut you off.
You know,

3299
01:53:46,641 --> 01:53:47,960
you've got to go as hard as you can
either.

3300
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:48,863
You know,
there's a,

3301
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:49,611
I've got a,
I've got,

3302
01:53:49,611 --> 01:53:52,160
I don't have that at home.
I've got to know the regular downwards

3303
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:54,020
and I keep ranking the damn thing cause
I go too hard.

3304
01:53:54,021 --> 01:53:55,250
You know,
I was just not strong enough.

3305
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:57,890
But when I go to the commercial gym,
there's a guy that they just made that

3306
01:53:57,891 --> 01:53:59,780
and they showed they and told him he had
me doing it ahead of,

3307
01:53:59,781 --> 01:54:02,800
there's another mma guy that,
I mean I can't remember any member's

3308
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:04,650
name,
but he was like a pride champion guy,

3309
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:08,240
like pride six or seven and they want it
and he's at the gym I'm at sometimes in

3310
01:54:08,241 --> 01:54:08,990
southern California.

3311
01:54:08,990 --> 01:54:11,480
But,
but I mean that thing is you just try

3312
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:12,150
do,
do you have those?

3313
01:54:12,150 --> 01:54:14,120
I'm sure those guys would come up here
and let you demo it,

3314
01:54:14,150 --> 01:54:16,610
you know,
and just get on there and go.

3315
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:18,050
You know,
and this is the thing I talked about

3316
01:54:18,051 --> 01:54:19,700
when I talk about high intensity
interval training.

3317
01:54:19,701 --> 01:54:23,030
You know a lot of people,
they don't get the high intensity part.

3318
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:23,600
You know,
they do,

3319
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:26,870
they'll do two bottles where they'll go
90% a hundred percent of the first one

3320
01:54:26,871 --> 01:54:30,020
and the by the time the third one,
they're down to like 60% because the

3321
01:54:30,021 --> 01:54:31,700
rest intervals are too short.
So I'm like,

3322
01:54:31,701 --> 01:54:34,280
man,
go like somebody's going to kill you for

3323
01:54:34,281 --> 01:54:38,150
20 seconds and then rest three or four
minutes and then go again.

3324
01:54:38,151 --> 01:54:39,530
Cause then you keep hitting that high
intense.

3325
01:54:39,531 --> 01:54:41,960
What I do with exercise when it comes to
weight lifting,

3326
01:54:41,961 --> 01:54:43,220
I take big breaks now.

3327
01:54:43,550 --> 01:54:45,130
They used to,
for weightlifting,

3328
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:47,480
I used to do like I just tried to burn
myself out.

3329
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:48,740
Yeah,
go to failure.

3330
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:51,440
Short is like if I get 30 seconds break,
hi,

3331
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:52,131
come on.
Next set,

3332
01:54:52,131 --> 01:54:52,964
next set.
I mean,

3333
01:54:52,990 --> 01:54:55,010
I don't do that anymore.
The problem with that is you're just

3334
01:54:55,011 --> 01:54:56,660
tired.
He knows what your training at the time.

3335
01:54:56,661 --> 01:54:58,160
Now there's a time to do the training.
You know,

3336
01:54:58,161 --> 01:54:59,510
like I said,
I,

3337
01:54:59,511 --> 01:55:00,890
you know,
when I break it up and I tell people how

3338
01:55:00,891 --> 01:55:01,671
to train,
I'm like look,

3339
01:55:01,671 --> 01:55:04,250
you train it for explosive and that's
the only thing you care about.

3340
01:55:04,251 --> 01:55:05,870
You don't get tired cause you're gonna,
you're gonna,

3341
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:08,510
you're gonna waste here.
You're not going to be tense enough.

3342
01:55:08,511 --> 01:55:10,370
The same thing with the sprinting,
the same thing.

3343
01:55:10,371 --> 01:55:13,610
We'll lift and give yourself enough of a
break so that you can focus and do what

3344
01:55:13,611 --> 01:55:14,420
you need to do.

3345
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:17,570
Then when it's conditioning time,
then you can go get tired of that shit.

3346
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:19,300
Do it with lightweights.
Yeah.

3347
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:20,870
That's one of the problems would like,
you know,

3348
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:23,990
I think crossfit,
there's a lot of good elements to their,

3349
01:55:23,991 --> 01:55:25,400
I mean there's a lot of people that do
well with it,

3350
01:55:25,401 --> 01:55:27,230
but some of the exercises they pick,
you know,

3351
01:55:27,231 --> 01:55:30,830
like when you get tired doing snatches,
the odds of you getting fucked up.

3352
01:55:31,310 --> 01:55:32,320
Our high,
very high.

3353
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:34,670
So I tell people,
do something that's,

3354
01:55:34,730 --> 01:55:37,430
you know,
it's hard and it's tiring and when you

3355
01:55:37,431 --> 01:55:39,470
get tired and your form breaks down,
you're not going to get hurt.

3356
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:40,580
You know,
she may do medicine,

3357
01:55:40,581 --> 01:55:43,350
ball slams,
you're jumping up and down on a box and

3358
01:55:43,351 --> 01:55:44,184
then you fuck up.

3359
01:55:44,290 --> 01:55:45,510
Right.
Your shit bloody.

3360
01:55:45,511 --> 01:55:45,990
You know,
what's,

3361
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:48,150
what's the point of that?
So I just have a,

3362
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:50,160
you know,
I've been told ropes are a great one for

3363
01:55:50,161 --> 01:55:52,620
that too.
There's no consequences to exhaust.

3364
01:55:52,621 --> 01:55:53,610
Exactly.
I think that's,

3365
01:55:53,611 --> 01:55:54,840
that's the way to do that.
And I've been,

3366
01:55:54,841 --> 01:55:57,090
you know,
I've been training for almost 40 years,

3367
01:55:57,091 --> 01:55:59,520
Joe and I haven't taken a week off.
Taking a week off is all that,

3368
01:55:59,521 --> 01:56:00,251
you know,
I'll take a week off.

3369
01:56:00,251 --> 01:56:02,280
And the same thing with you.
I know as you take too much time,

3370
01:56:02,910 --> 01:56:03,930
you just don't feel good.
Miss.

3371
01:56:03,931 --> 01:56:07,950
The other thing about this diet,
my recovery passage capacity is huge.

3372
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:11,190
I mean,
I can train super-intense every single

3373
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:11,450
day,
you know,

3374
01:56:11,450 --> 01:56:12,990
without a break,
which is Kinda Nice.

3375
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:14,940
I mean,
this is the other thing that I get

3376
01:56:14,941 --> 01:56:16,710
people telling me all the time is,
you know,

3377
01:56:16,711 --> 01:56:17,910
they're,
I mean,

3378
01:56:17,911 --> 01:56:21,570
they're hitting prs on dead lists are
doing all this personal record for non

3379
01:56:21,571 --> 01:56:22,170
athletes.

3380
01:56:22,170 --> 01:56:23,003
Yeah,
I'm sorry.

3381
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:26,400
So I'm not used to,
you know what I'm talking about,

3382
01:56:26,401 --> 01:56:27,061
but I mean,
it's like,

3383
01:56:27,061 --> 01:56:28,260
you know,
I get these people all the time,

3384
01:56:28,261 --> 01:56:28,681
they're like,
man,

3385
01:56:28,681 --> 01:56:30,300
I'm hitting pushup records chinup
records.

3386
01:56:30,450 --> 01:56:32,820
But dead lift went up 100 pounds and
three months from,

3387
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:34,560
from just eating meat and stuff like
that.

3388
01:56:34,561 --> 01:56:37,200
So I think there's something to it.
I mean I have people that are telling

3389
01:56:37,201 --> 01:56:38,034
me,
my dad,

3390
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:39,210
I put my dad on his tie,
right?

3391
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:42,090
He's 74 years old,
two months in the Diet.

3392
01:56:42,091 --> 01:56:42,990
He goes,
hey man,

3393
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:45,690
this is a biggest my biceps ever been in
my life.

3394
01:56:46,670 --> 01:56:48,720
And he's just eating meat.
That is crazy.

3395
01:56:48,721 --> 01:56:50,580
So he's like,
he's just putting on muscle just cause

3396
01:56:50,581 --> 01:56:53,160
he's taken in so much animal tissue.
So listen man,

3397
01:56:53,161 --> 01:56:56,520
